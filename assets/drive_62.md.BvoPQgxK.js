It focuses on Grace's (Jessica Sula) effort to get a good mark in her AS Drama by directing a production of William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night in order to be allowed by her father, David Blood, to stay at Roundview College.http://www.e4.com/skins/series5/ep7-guide.html Synopsis Rich and Grace wake up after having sex, and Grace realises, to her horror, that they are at her house, which she has always tried to avoid. It turns out that her father is David Blood, the Roundview College headmaster. She attempts to smuggle Rich out without her father noticing, but he is discovered and Grace is forced to acknowledge him as her boyfriend. Blood firmly informs his daughter that their \\"experiment\\" is over and it is time she returned to her old boarding school. After Grace protests, he agrees that she may stay on the condition that she gets only As, starting now from her AS drama exam, a production of Twelfth Night, which stars the entire gang except Nick. Her relief turns to fear when Liv, a lead, forces Matty to quit as well, saying it is because she feels the gang are still angry with her for what she did with Nick. In fact, she is actually doing it because she has grown suspicious that Franky loves Matty, after watching them rehearse a particularly emotional scene from the play. Grace, after hearing Liv's excuse, decides to invite her, along with the other girls, to her house for a girl's night. Meanwhile, Rich is called into Professor Blood's office, where Blood has his academic records and his father's employment records. He offers to help Rich and give his father a better position in the Civil Service, if he sabotages Grace's play, leaving Rich in a difficult choice to either help his not-so-well-off family or Grace. Shortly after, he agrees to invite Rich to dinner - which is very awkward, mostly due to his continual glaring at him. After dinner, Rich has a quiet argument with Grace, noting that she is a different person around her parents than when around him. Then the three girls arrive for the promised girls' night. They are shocked to discover Grace's secret, but then go up to Grace's room. There, she attempts to get them to rehearse, but they give in to Liv's offer of cocaine. While high, Franky's sexuality is brought up again, this time by Mini. When Franky gives the very vague response of saying she is \\"into people,\\" Liv suspiciously asks her who she is \\"into\\" at the moment. Seeing Franky is unwilling to answer this question, Grace changes the subject. After Professor Blood becomes suspicious, they quickly leave and go to a nearby nightclub. There, Mini and Franky go off to flirt with two unattractive men as a joke, and Grace discovers the rest of the gang are there. Tensions arise when Matty, seeing that one of the men is being too forward with Franky, marches over and scares him off, only to get into an argument with Mini and Liv. Grace then attempts to leave with a drunk Rich. Rich, however, firmly informs her that he doesn't know who is the real Grace, and angrily walks home himself. The next morning, Grace complains to her mother about the difficulty of her task and keeping her friends together. Her mother reminds her of the tale of Rapunzel, which she used to tell her when she was small. Deciding to \\"take control and be creative\\", Grace instructs Mini, who is standing in for Liv, to kiss Franky, the next morning at rehearsal. Her argument with Rich continues when he questions whether they are right for each other. Crying, she goes to the theatre. There, she tests the acoustics by reciting Hamlet's \\"To Be or Not To Be\\" soliloquy with Doug. The words resonate with her and, feeling empowered, she goes to Matty's and demands that he return to the play. He does, but there is a noticeable tension between him and Franky, made clear when she avoids his kiss. Seeing that not having Liv around will affect her grade, Grace gets frustrated, and goes to look for her. After finding her, she talks her into returning to the play. Grace‚Äôs production begins well, with Liv and Franky performing their scene well with limited practice together. Rich evidently does not sabotage the play, even shooting Professor Blood a defiant look as he performs his scene. However, having seen Matty‚Äôs shocked reaction at seeing her kiss Franky, Liv has a heated, but very quiet argument with him backstage. She demands to know if he is in love with Franky. When he fails to respond, she tearfully informs him that they‚Äôll be good together. But Grace intervenes and tells her to stay. Angry, Liv tells Matty to forget Franky, who is left in something of a state just minutes before she is meant to go on again. But they are successful in performing the final scene and receive a standing ovation. But, to Grace‚Äôs fury, she discovers that her father has been deceiving her the whole time ‚Äì despite the fact that she got a good grade, he actually intends to send her back to her old school anyway. He protests, \\"I just want better for you\\", to which she coldly responds, \\"No, David, you just want a different daughter\\". Her mother comes into her room later that evening, and once again attempts to make her feel better with more stories, but she coldly scoffs at her mother for filling her head with lies and fantasies that mask her reality, causing her mother to leave unhappily. At that moment, Rich turns up outside her window and serenades her by reciting some verses from Romeo and Juliet. He climbs up the drainpipe into her room and, beginning to cry, asks her to marry him. She replies with Miranda's speech from The Tempest: O wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world! That has such people in it!

He founded and directed for 30 years a non-profit organization called Ground Zero Minnesota dedicated to \\"top-quality, non-partisan education for informed democracy and human survival.\\" Andregg has published numerous articles, study guides, documentaries and papers on biology, genetics, technology and contemporary social problems related to armed conflict. He has produced over 50 educational videos on wide-ranging subjects and his national award-winning book, On the Causes of War, was released in November 1997.  Education  Andregg earned a Ph.D. in behavior genetics (1977) from the University of California, Davis after completing a triple-major B.S. in genetics, zoology and physical anthropology (1973). He studied under Theodosius Dobzhansky a prominent geneticist, evolutionary biologist and National Medal of Science recipient. During his university career, Andregg conducted field research on the behaviors of Barbary Apes (Macaca sylvanus) in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco and co-authored several articles with his mentor Dobzhansky, including \\"Distribution Among the Chromosomes of Drosophila pseudoobscura of the Genes Governing the Response to Light\\"Dobzhansky, Theodosius, Olga Pavlovski and Michael Andregg. ‚ÄúDistribution Among the Chromosomes of Drosophila pseudoobscura of the Genes Governing the Response to Light.‚Äù Genetics, 81:2, 1975. and \\"Ecological Variables Affecting the Dispersal Behavior of Drosophila pseudoobscura and its Relatives.\\"Dobzhansky, Theodosius, J.R.

Andregg. ‚ÄúEcological Variables Affecting the Dispersal Behavior of Drosophila pseudoobscura and its Relatives.‚Äù Genetics, 83:2, 1976 After completing two years of postdoctoral research at the University of Minnesota, he came to believe that war was a much greater public health hazard than rare diseases or abstract theories, and began to dedicate his life to the study of contemporary social problems, especially causes of war and sustainable development.  Career  Andregg's study of global armed conflict and genocide resulted in his book, On the Causes of War, which won the International PeaceWriting Award in 1999, was reprinted twice, republished in Canada and translated into Italian. He taught undergraduate and graduate courses for 35 years as an adjunct at the University of Minnesota, with brief stints at Macalester and Gustavus Adolphus Colleges. He joined the Justice and Peace Studies faculty at the University of St. Thomas in 1993 and taught in the Aquinas Scholars program there until 2017. Andregg has lectured four times in South Korea and Japan on sustainable development, WMD and causes of wars, five times at Romania‚Äôs National Intelligence Academy, and at many other European conferences on intelligence reform, and human survival issues. He still lectures occasionally at American war and intelligence colleges, like the National Intelligence University, Army Command and General Staff College, and the Naval Postgraduate School. In 1982, Andregg founded an educational, non-profit organization called Ground Zero Minnesota, which produced over 50 public television programs and sponsored about 5,000 educational programs in schools, churches, and civic groups on issues of peace and justice, many on the status and implications of weapons of mass destruction.For Young Activists, Peacemaking 101 by Tom Ford and Bob von Sternberg, Minneapolis Star Tribune, December 17th, 2002 He serves on the boards of the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations, the United Nations Association of Minnesota, the Committee on Foreign Relations of Minnesota and is involved with many academic associations. As a corollary to his research on the causes of war, Andregg began studying the craft of intelligence-gathering, analysis, espionage and action focusing on intelligence reform. He has arranged and moderated over twenty panels for intelligence-related conferences around the world, and presented at dozens more. He wrote a chapter on intelligence ethics for a textbook on intelligence studies,\\"Intelligence Ethics: Laying a Foundation for the Second Oldest Profession,\\" Chapter 4 in the Handbook for Intelligence Studies, Routledge Press, 2007, 2009 edited by Loch Johnson. a Handbook on Intelligence Ethics, and a similar chapter for The Oxford Handbook of National Security Intelligence in 2009. His 2007 edited reader on intelligence ethics includes essays from 14 professionals from six countries. In 2008, Andregg released a documentary, \\"Rethinking 9/11: Why Truth and Reconciliation are Better Strategies Than Global War\\",produced by ETS Pictures which examines certain unanswered questions of who was behind the September 11, 2001 attacks and calls for a full, impartial examination of the evidence. Dr. Andregg is a frequent public speaker, lecturer, media commentator and mediator who has briefed Minnesota police, fire and public health officials on the effects of weapons of mass destruction. In 2008, he acted as a liaison between peace activists and the local police department during the Republican National Convention, held in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

His mother was the Trojan captive, Hesione or Theaneira.  Mythology  When Trambelus' mother had already been made pregnant by Telamon, she escaped by jumping off his ship and swimming until she reached the land of Miletus. She then hid in the forest but was soon found by Arion, king of Miletus, who rescued her and raised her newborn son Trambelus as his own.Tzetzes on Lycophron, 467 According to Parthenius,Parthenius, Erotica Pathemata 26 citing the Thrax by Euphorion Trambelus lived on Lesbos where he fell in love with a girl named Apriate, but she rejected all his advances. Desperate, he laid a snare for her and tried to take her by force, but she defended herself so vigorously that he got enraged and pushed her off a cliff into the sea; alternately, she leaped off the cliff herself, preferring to die rather than give up her chastity. Not much later, the same source relates, Lesbos was attacked by Achilles and his troops. Trambelus was among the defenders of the island and was mortally wounded in the battle. Achilles, impressed by his valor, inquired of his name; Trambelus managed to answer before he died. On realizing that the fallen opponent was his cousin, Achilles mourned Trambelus and piled up a tomb for him on the seashore; this tomb was still there in historical times. John Tzetzes relates the same story of Trambelus' death, but states that it took place in Miletus (not on Lesbos). This version is also hinted at by Athenaeus, who refers to Trambelus as \\"king of the Leleges\\", and informs that there was a spring in Miletus known as the \\"Achilles' Well\\", in which Achilles was believed to have cleansed himself for the murder of Trambelus; the water of the spring was said to be salty on the surface, but very sweet in the main stream.Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae 2.43b p. 189 with a reference to Aristobulus of Cassandreia Notes  References  * Athenaeus of Naucratis, The Deipnosophists or Banquet of the Learned.

Glassjaw and Head Automatica frontman Daryl Palumbo remixed the track \\"Choose Your Adventure\\". Background and production Following the demise of Quicksand, frontman Walter Schreifels formed Rival Schools at the recommendation of his label Island Records. The band consisted of Schreifels, and hardcore punk veterans Sam Siegler on drums, Cache Tolman on bass; guitarist Ian Love joined months later. The band released United by Fate in September 2001,Cohen 2001, p. 14 and promoted it through to mid-2002.Various tours: * Cohen 2001, p. 14  * In December that same year, Love announced his departure from the group, choosing to focus on his side project Cardia. In early 2003, Chris Traynor of Bush was announced as their new guitarist, and the band recorded their second album. Island Records subsequently shelved it, and the group broke up. Schreifels moved to Berlin, Germany, produced albums for Hot Water Music and CIV, formed Walking Concert, reunited his first band Gorilla Biscuits, and moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Siegler joined Nightmare of You, and Traynor and Tolman formed Institute. Rival Schools reformed in April 2008, which Schreifels credited to the Gorilla Biscuits reunion: \\"I longed for the togetherness that defines Rival Schools.\\" They appeared at a variety of festivals and went on a UK tour. During a performance at Download Festival, they debuted four new songs. The band wrote some new material and made demos shortly after the reunion; they wrote an additional five-or-six prior to entering a studio. On January 27, 2009, the band announced they had begun recording a new album, and eventually finished in late 2009. The majority of the album was done at House of Love in Brooklyn, New York, with the band producing and Love handling recording. Additional recording was held at Studio G, with Joel Hamilton and assistance by Francisco Botero. Love mixed \\"Wring It Out\\" and \\"The Ghost Is Out There\\", Chris Sheldon mixed \\"69 Guns\\", \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" and \\"Shot After Shot\\", with the remainder being done by Hamilton. Will Quinnell mastered the recordings at Sterling Sound. Composition Pedals has been described as an emo, pop rock and post- hardcore release, utilizing less distortion and a lack of heavy sound that was prevalent on United by Fate. Schreifels said the writing was informed by the experiences the members had while in their various other bands between 2003 and 2008. He focused more of his efforts on writing melodies and lyrics, returning to similar themes he had tackled previously. Schreifels' grunge- esque vocals had developed into a raspy baritone. The title Pedals referred to the situations that lead up to the making of the album, as Schreifels explains: \\"Sometimes we‚Äôre uphill. There‚Äôs a lot of movement and organization\\", in addition to using various effects pedals. The opening track \\"Wring It Out\\" featured four different guitar parts, and a bassline that recalled the one in \\"Travel by Telephone\\", the opening track from United by Fate. \\"69 Guns\\" sees an arpeggio part ascending over melodic riffs and feedback. It uses acoustic guitars, as well as a piano during the bridge section. The title is a reference to the Alarm track \\"68 Guns\\". \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" chaneled their debut's brighter material, specially \\"Used for Glue\\". \\"Choose Your Adventure\\" incorporates synthesizers and an organ; it, alongside \\"The Ghost Is Out There\\", channeled the heavy sound of Quicksand. The orchestral ballad \\"Racing to Red Lights\\" occasionally had sparse, slower instrumentation; the intro to it was reminiscent of the Stratford 4's The Revolt Against Tired Noises (2002). Following track \\"Shot After Shot\\" was a combination of hardcore punk and shoegaze; it, along with \\"Big Waves\\" were new versions of tracks from their scrapped second album. The main guitar riff and verse music evolved from those sessions, while \\"Big Waves\\" retained its structure and arrangement. Both tracks were credited to the band and Traynor. \\"Small Doses\\", a Smiths-indebted track, featured Schreifels crooning and shared a thematic similarity with \\"Institutionalized\\" by Suicidal Tendencies. He said it was about having a break from other people. Release The album was delayed due to the group being in discussions with various labels, such as Vagrant Records. In March 2010, the band signed with Photo Finish Records, who had a distribution deal with major label Atlantic Records; the new record was expected for release later in the year. Siegler, who acted as the band's manager, said they were attracted to them due to their social-networking skills and that several of the people who worked with the band at Island Records during United by Fate now worked at Photo Finish.Wood 2011, p. 31 Following this, Schreifels embarked on a solo UK tour in March and April, leading up to the release of his solo album An Open Letter to the Scene in May. \\"Shot After Shot\\" premiered on BBC Radio 1 on September 30. In October, the band played a few US shows with the Gaslight Anthem. \\"Shot After Shot\\" was released as a single on November 14, and was promoted with a one-off UK show two days later. On February 17, 2011, an outtake from the sessions, \\"You Should Have Hung Out\\", was made available for streaming. On February 22, \\"Wring It Out\\" premiered through Spinner. Pedals was made available for streaming on March 1. The following day, a music video was released for \\"Wring It Out\\", directed by Jordan Galland. It was influenced by an exorcist and features Jemima Kirke as a possessed girl. The track was released as a single on March 6. Pedals was released on March 8; its artwork was a painting of poppies that was done by Alex Brown. The following month, the group went on a co-headlining UK tour with ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead. \\"Wring It Out\\" and \\"Choose Your Adventure\\" were released on a 7\\" vinyl single as part of Record Store Day. An Ad-Rock remix of \\"69 Guns\\" premiered through Spin on April 25. It came about due to the friendship between Siegler and Ad- Rock. In May, the band went on a brief west coast tour. On August 5, a music video was released for \\"Eyes Wide Open\\", which featured references to Repulsion (1965). A promotional CD featured \\"Racing to Red Lights\\", a Daryl Palumbo (of Glassjaw) remix of \\"Choose Your Adventure\\", and acoustic versions of \\"Wring It Out\\" and \\"Small Doses\\". Later in the month, the band performed at Lollapalooza in the US, and at a one-off UK show. On September 28, it was announced that Love had left the band a second time. In October, the group embarked on a headlining US tour with support from Balance and Composure and Hostage Calm. In June 2012, the group appeared at the North by Northeast showcase. In September, the band played a few shows in Australia, with support from Toy Boats. Reception Pedals received mixed-to-positive reviews from music critics.

It has become a national event focused on the emotion and character of automotive design.  History  The Eyes on Design Show was established on the late-1986 as both celebration of automotive design and a fundraiser for the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, a nonprofit organization in Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan, devoted to matters pertaining to the eye and vision. The first shows were called \\"Eyes On The Classics\\". The first shows were held in the Grosse Pointe Academy parking lots. Initially focused on the domestic \\"Big Three\\" (General Motors, Ford and Chrysler), the show was expanded to include automakers from around the world. The name was also changed to \\"EyesOn Design\\". For its third show, the venue moved to the grounds of the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House. To ease access and accommodate the increasing public attendance, the design chiefs at DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and General Motors suggested that the event be hosted by one of their companies each year. The 2002 show was held at the Chrysler Headquarters and Technology Center in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The theme for this 15th anniversary weekend-long show was \\"Performance Vehicles\\". In 2003, the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan hosted the event. According to General Motors, the 2003 event was the largest, most complete collection of concept vehicles ever assembled representing the very best efforts of GM, Ford, Chrysler, and other automakers. The three-day event was also the first time the GM Design Center was open to the general public. Attendees also had the opportunity to purchase rides in notable GM concept cars. A Founding Chairman of the annual EyesOn Design event, Chuck Jordan, was commemorated during the January 2011 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The EyesOn Design show celebrated its 25th anniversary during summer 2012, on the grounds of the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House with over 200 vehicles displayed by invitation only.  Design focus  The \\"Eyes on Design Show\\" has grown from an East Side show to an automobile exhibition of national and international significance. According to the Ford Motor Company, the Eyes on Design Show is the world's only car show to focus on the emotion and character of automotive design. Bringing together some 250 concept cars in one place is the secret of the show's success that has been driven by the enthusiastic assistance of automotive design executives.

Estimates range from 72,000 to 110,000. Estimated number in China In 2005, the number of Americans living in China reached a historic high of 110,000. Most expatriates living in China come from neighboring Asian nations. An estimate published in 2018 counted 600,000 people of other nations living in China, with 12% of those from the US; that means approximately 72,000 Americans living in China. Based on data collected in 1999, when 64,602 Americans lived in China, most lived in Hong Kong (48,220 in 1999), with smaller numbers in Beijing (10,000), Guangzhou (3,200), Shanghai (2,382), Shenyang (555) and Chengdu (800). Hong Kong Since the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong, Americans have arguably surpassed the British as the major non-Chinese influence. There are more Americans than Britons living in the territory, and 1,100 American companies employ 10% of the Hong Kong workforce; the current head of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, Eden Woon, is the first American to hold the position in the territory's history. In addition, ships of the United States Navy made from 60 to 80 port visits each year, reported in 1998. Mainland China According to the Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China conducted in 2010, there are 71,493 Americans residing in Mainland China, the second largest single group of foreign nationals behind Koreans in China. Americans have been coming to China for job opportunities since 1994. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, a growing number of Americans in their 20s and 30s headed to China for employment, lured by its faster- growing economy and good pay in the financial sector. Many of them teach English, a service in demand from Chinese businesspeople and students and a growing number are arriving with skills and experience in computers, finance and other fields.

It is a private, nonsectarian school situated Sta. Ana cor. J.P. Laurel Ave., Davao City, Philippines. History The Davao Chong Hua High School, formerly known as the Davao Central High School and Davao Chinese High School, was founded on June 3, 1924. It traced its humble beginning to two rented classrooms at San Pedro Street with only 30 students. Seeing the necessity of acquiring a permanent school site, Don Francisco Villa-Abrille Lim Juna (ÊûóÂÖ®‰ªΩ), a charter board member, donated a 10,000 square- meter lot, which became the present school site. The first building was a one- storey wooden structure. Classes were held in the new site in January 1925 with the aim of preserving and propagating Chinese language and culture. The school offered a dual curriculum in English and Chinese. It was then the only school in the City of Davao offering Chinese language. After twenty years of development, three classroom buildings and one dormitory were constructed, with a student population of more than 300. However, toward the end of the Japanese occupation during the World War II, all but one building were destroyed. After the war, four more classroom buildings and one dormitory was constructed. In 1965, the city government expropriated 1,789 square meters of the school property for the Sta. Ana Avenue, which cuts through the school campus. In 1976, in compliance with Presidential Decree No.176 Filipinizing alien schools all over the country, the name Davao Chinese High School was change into Davao Central High School. From 1983 to 1998, the Board of Trustees under the leadership of the dynamic chairman, Guilbert Go, completed the construction of the three-storey concrete buildings and one four-storey building. This paved the way to start the modernization of Davao Central High School. Delfin Go succeeded Guilbert Go as the chairman of the Board of Trustees in 1998. During his term, a modern three-storey building was constructed and named Tan Yan Kee Memorial Preschool in honor of the father of Dr. Lucio Tan, chairman emeritus of the Board of Trustees. Another grand project, the Jolly Central Covered Court, was donated by an alumnus, Tony Tan Caktiong. After the term of Delfin Go, Chua Tun-Chuan and Jesus Uy succeeded one after the other, as the chairmen of the Board. During their terms, the school continued to march achieving quality education. School emblem Former logo as Davao Central High School from 1976 to 2016 The school emblem, representing the five-leaf clover, is the national flower of China known as the \\"Mei Hua.\\" The tiny pink flower blooms in the coldest winter. The colder the weather, the more the beautiful its bloom. This rare quality symbolizes nobility and the strength of the character, as well as courage and persistence. Hence, it was chosen as the school emblem for the same significance. Community Davao Chong Hua High School is part of the Filipino-Chinese schools in Davao City.

At the camp Mehboob picked up different languages and songs from soldiers drawn from various parts of the country, some Britishers too.\\"That forgotten maverick‚Äôs voice‚Ä¶\\" Mehboob grew up to become the singer of choice for the various pre-nuptial ceremonies conducted by rich families in Cochin. He made his name, friends and admirers from here. Mehboob had no real home, but he lived with his friends. Many of his early songs were written by Mepalli Balan and Nelson Fernandes, with that special Mattancherry flavour. These songs were never recorded.\\"Mehboob ‚Äì The Forgotten Singer\\" . Varnachithram. Retrieved 11 March 2011. It was Pankaj Mullick who recognised Mehboob's singing ability for the first time. He recommended Mehboob for several \\"Kacheris\\" and Mohammed Rafi concerts. Mehboob became quite famous throughout Cochin in late 1940s itself. Cochin based actor Muthiah recommended Mehboob to music director Dakshinamoorthy, who was looking for a new voice for the film Jeevitha Nouka. Mehboob recorded three songs including the popular \\"Akaale Aarum Kaividum\\" for this film, widely known to be the first superhit film in Malayalam. (This song was a ditto copy of \\"Suhani Raat Dhal Chuki\\" from Dulari. It was later in 1985, re-recorded by K. J. Yesudas and this version is featured in the currently available prints of the film.) With the success of this song, Mehboob was shot to fame and became the most sought after singer of that time. In 1954, he recorded \\"Manennum Vilikkila\\", for the landmark film Neelakkuyil, which became a tremendous success. He went on to record numerous hit songs for composers M. S. Baburaj, K. Raghavan, G. Devarajan, R. K. Shekhar and many more. Most of his songs were folk music based comic numbers and had lyrics by P. Bhaskaran. Mehboob has also recorded numerous songs for stage plays, gramaphone records and other programmes, which is perhaps many times more than he recorded for films. He was also an inevitable performer in \\"Mehfils\\" and other concerts. Mehboob was never a careerist. He was known to be an alcoholic and finally died nearly an impoverished man, aged 56. Many of his songs were remixed and used in later Malayalam films. A part of the song \\"Theerchaayilla Janam\\", written by Kannan Pareekutty and sung in 1956, was rendered by actor Mohanlal for the 1999 film Usthaad. The 2013 film Annayum Rasoolum used the songs \\"Kandu Randu Kannu\\" (composed by M. S. Baburaj and written by P. A. Kasim for the 1973 film Chuzhi) and \\"Kayalinarike\\" (written by Meppalli Balan). The 2013 film ABCD: American-Born Confused Desi featured the song \\"Nayapaisayilla\\" from the film Neelisally (1960).

He was an underage enlistee who went on to become a flying ace credited with 11 official aerial victories. Early life Beck's parents had emigrated to Argentina from Cumbria. He was anxious enough to serve in British uniform that he lied his way into the Royal Flying Corps while still underage. As he was born on 3 November 1899, his graduation from pilot training in July 1917 saw him pitched into battle four months before his \\"legal\\" 18th birthday.Franks (2007), p.20. World War I On 21 June 1917 temporary Second Lieutenant A. Beck was appointed a Flying Officer in the Royal Flying Corps. His seniority of rank was then back-dated to 1 June 1916. He then flew 13 combat patrols with 60 Squadron before his parents apprised the RFC of his true age. Once it was known he was younger than 18 years old, he was withdrawn from both combat duty and France. He returned to 60 Squadron in March 1918, and scored his first win in August; flying a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a, he destroyed a German Fokker D.VII fighter plane on the 8th. He followed this up by destroying a Hannover reconnaissance plane over Riencourt in the early morning of 14 August, and an Albatros over Guemappe in mid-morning. On 31 August, he shared in the destruction of an LVG two-seater recon plane over Inchy.Shores, et al, p. 70. On 28 September 1918, he destroyed another LVG two-seater over Cambrai to become an ace. Then, in October 1918, he scored five more times: a Fokker D.VII out of control over Esnes on the 3rd; an LVG captured at Bohain-en-Vermandois on the 9th; a Halberstadt recon plane captured on the 22nd at Orvillers-Sorel; a share in an LVG destroyed over Le Quesnoy on the 26th; another Fokker D.VII out of control over Mormal on the 29th. On 1 November, he helped shoot down a Fokker D.VII over Mormal Woods for his and his squadron's final victory. Distinguished Flying Cross He won a Distinguished Flying Cross, gazetted 3 December 1918. The accompanying award citation read: :Lieutenant (Acting-Captain) Alexander Beck. :A bold and skilful leader, who has himself shot down four enemy aeroplanes.

Early years  Stefanaki started playing piano very early in her childhood at the age of five. Her parents cultivated her natural musical talent by enrolling her for piano lessons at the age of six, along with guitar, theory and harmony at the \\"Apollo Conservatory of Music\\" at Heraklion, Crete. This journey lasted 12 years. Later, she continued her music education with voice lessons at the \\"Olympic Athens Conservatory\\". She started ballet lessons as well at the age of six for five continuous years. The dream to become an actress pushed her to participate in several school plays throughout her school years. She learned traditional Cretan dances in the dance school of Lazarus Hnaris. Her love for Cretan music, drove her to follow her father (a Cretan folk dancer), to traditional festivals of Crete, where she refined her dancing competence. While in high school, Stefanaki participated in \\"Korae\\" choir as well as in the choir of St. Menas church under the direction of Mrs Xylouris. During a festival at her senior year of high school, where she played guitar and sang, she were offered to sing professionally at a known piano restaurant at Heraklion. This milestone signaled her professional journey as a singer.  Collaborations  In 1996, Manolis Lidakis proposed a collaboration and they worked together during summer concerts. That first summer was followed by several collaborations with Greek singers such as: * 1997, with George Hatzinasios and Stefanos Korkolis. * 1999 to 2002, with Vicky Moscholiou. * 2001, with Yannis Spanos. * 2004, with Mimis Plessas and Dimitris Mitropanos. * 2005, with Costas Macedonas, Dimitris Basis and Glykeria. * 2007, with Christos Nikolopoulos. * 2008, with Manolis Mitsias.

It is the Italian section of the International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist), or \\"Spartacist\\" tendency within international Trotskyism. The Italian Spartacists came from two different organizational splits. One was formed in 1975 from dissidents of the Revolutionary Marxist Fraction led by Roberto Massari who announced the creation of a Spartacist Nucleus at the July 1975 European encampment of the international Spartacist tendency.Alexander, Robert International Trotskyism: a documented analysis of the world movement Durham, Duke University Press 1991 p.597 The other group had its origins in the Gruppi Comunisti Rivoluzionari, the Italian party affiliated with the United Secretariat of the Fourth International. This group left in 1976 in protest over the LCRs endorsement of the Proletarian Democracy electoral coalition, which it regarded as a kind of popular front. This group first called itself the Bolshevik-Leninist Group for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International. It adopted the name Trotkyist League of Italy in April 1978, bey which time it had absorbed the Spartacist Nucleus. It also attempted to unify with the ex-Lambertist Bolshevik-Leninist Group of Italy, but nothing came of this.Alexander, Robert International Trotskyism: a documented analysis of the world movement Durham, Duke University Press 1991 p.597 The LTI grew closer to the international Spartacist tendency, sending a fraternal delegate to its first international conference in London in August 1979 and officially became its Italian sympathizing section in August 1980.

Weber (August 7, 1849 ‚Äì February 4, 1943) was a seaman, carpenter and union organizer from Milwaukee who between 1907 and 1926 served five (non- continuous) terms as a Socialist member of the Wisconsin State Assembly.Cannon, A. Peter, ed. Members of the Wisconsin Legislature: 1848 ‚Äì 1999. State of Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau Informational Bulletin 99-1, September 1999  Background  Weber was born in the city of Milwaukee on August 7, 1849. In 1852 his family moved to Grafton in Ozaukee County, and he attended public school in Ulao. After completing apprenticeship, Weber became an able seaman and sailed on Great Lakes and Atlantic Ocean merchant ships (according to his 1906 official biography, \\"in which capacity he visited all the most important seaports of the world\\").  Labor movement  He joined the Lake Seamen's Union in 1868, and was active in the Knights of Labor after 1869. In 1887 he helped organize the Milwaukee Federated Trades Council, becoming its secretary in 1902: an office he would hold until his retirement in January 1934. In 1888 Weber organized ship cargo handlers into what became the International Longshoremen's Association, and in the same year organized a Carpenters' Union in Milwaukee. In 1893 Weber was chosen the first president of the Wisconsin State Federation of Labor. As of 1894 he refused the title of President, preferring to be General Organizer; he was to hold that office until 1917. Weber fought to align the State Federation of Labor with the goals and principles of the Social Democratic Party (as it was long known in Wisconsin). As of 1906 he boasted that he had been a member of a labor organization for 40 years, and was also one of the General Organizers of the American Federation of Labor.  Political office and service  In 1904 Weber was a Socialist candidate for Presidential elector from Milwaukee.Beck, J. D., ed. The blue book of the state of Wisconsin Madison: Democrat Printing Co., State Printer, 1907; pp. 1067, 1164 In 1906 he was elected to the Assembly from the 16th Milwaukee County district (the 20th ward of the City of Milwaukee), succeeding fellow Socialist August W. Strehlow. Weber won with 1,580 votes to 1,080 for Republican Edward Groeling.Beck, J. D., ed. The blue book of the state of Wisconsin Madison: Democrat Printing Co., State Printer, 1907; pp. 618, 645-6 In 1908 he was re-elected, with 1,799 votes against to 1,380 for Republican Louis Goulki and 825 for Democrat Charles Newser. Weber was assigned to the standing committee on Manufactures and Labor. Beck, J. D., ed. The blue book of the state of Wisconsin Madison: Democrat Printing Co., State Printer, 1909; pp. 1133, 567 In the Assembly Weber worked for the passage of laws establishing the Wisconsin Industrial Commission (with Charles H. Crownhart and John R. Commons he wrote the industrial commission law in 1911), workmen's compensation, the state system of technical education, and other statutes favorable to the interests of the working class. In 1926 (at which time he was State Chairman of the Socialist Party of Wisconsin), rather than run for re-election to the Assembly, he opted to challenge incumbent State Senator Bernhard Gettelman. He lost the election to Gettelman, with 8,074 votes to 10,589 for the incumbent.Holmes, Fred L., ed. The Wisconsin blue book, 1927 Madison: Democrat Printing Company, State Printer, 1927; pp. 507, 584  After the Assembly  As he had always done when not in the legislature himself, he continued to spend time during the session at Madison lobbying for labor.

The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360-degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Cypress included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point-class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode. Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.Scotti, p 10Scotti, p 219 History After delivery in 1961, Point Cypress was assigned a homeport of Boston, Massachusetts, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. At the request of the United States Navy, in October 1965, she was alerted for service in South Vietnam and assigned to Coast Guard Squadron One in support of Operation Market Time along with eight other Point-class cutters.Larzelere, p 72Cutler, p 84 While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, Point Cypress was loaded on board merchant ship and transported to Subic Bay, Philippines arriving in January 1966 where she was refitted for combat service.Coast Guard Historian photos websiteLarzelere, p 74 Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of four M2 machine guns.

The Division of Water Resources is organized around three programs: Water Appropriation, Water Structures, and Water Management Services. The Division of Water Resources is headquartered in Manhattan, Kansas, with field office locations in Topeka, Stafford, Stockton, and Garden City.  History  = 1927-1951 = Kansas Interstate River Compacts The Division of Water Resources was created in 1927, which effectively consolidated the Kansas Water Commission of 1917 and the Division of Irrigation of 1919. George S. Knapp, who had been appointed state irrigation commissioner, became the first chief engineer in 1927. Under his 32 years of service, various laws were enacted, including the Levee Law (1929), Obstructions in Streams (1929), Water Storage Law (1941), and the Kansas Water Appropriation Act (1945). Also signed at this time were the Republican River Compact (1943) and the Arkansas River Compact (1949). = 1951-1972 = In 1951, Robert V. Smrha became the second chief engineer and served for 21 years. Under his administration there were major amendments to the Kansas Water Appropriation Act in 1957 that addressed water right changes and filing requirements. In addition, the Kansas-Oklahoma Arkansas River Compact (1966) and the Big Blue River Compact (1971) were signed. In 1972 the Groundwater Management District Act was enacted. Kansas Groundwater Management Districts Intensive Groundwater Use Control Areas in Kansas = 1972-1983 = Guy E. Gibson was the third chief engineer, who served from 1972 to 1983. Under Gibson, Groundwater Management District Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were formed in Kansas from 1973 to 1976. Major amendments to the Groundwater Management District Act occurred in 1978, which added a process to allow for the creation of intensive groundwater use control areas. This addition to the statutes provided the chief engineer authority to implement more comprehensive corrective control provisions for water supply protection when local conditions require it or by the request of local stakeholders. Intensive groundwater use control areasIGUCAs were designated in McPherson in 1980 and the Pawnee River Valley in 1981. In addition, the enactment of the Water Plan Storage Act (1974) and the Water Transfer Act (1983) occurred under Gibson‚Äôs administration. = 1983-2007 = In 1983, David L. Pope became the fourth chief engineer and served for 24 years. Over his tenure, extensive rules and regulations were developed and adopted under the Kansas Water Appropriation Act, Obstructions in Steams, and the Levee Law. He also designated additional intensive groundwater use control areas in Burrton (1984), Lower Smoky Hill River Valley (1984), Hays (1985), Arkansas River Valley (1986), Upper Smoky Hill River Valley (1988), and Walnut Creek (1992). In addition, Kansas v. Colorado was filed in 1985 to enforce terms of the Arkansas River Compact. In 1998 Kansas v. Nebraska and Colorado also filed to enforce terms of the Republican River Compact. The Final Settlement Stipulation of the Republican River Compact occurred in 2003. For the Arkansas River Compact violations, damages exceeding $35 million were paid to Kansas in 2005-2006. Other milestones under Pope‚Äôs administration included the enactment of the Water Assurance Program Act (1986), Floodplain Zoning Ordinances Act (1991), and the Water Banking Act (2001). = 2007-Current = The present chief engineer, David Barfield has initiated the enforcement of the Republican River Compact Settlement in 2007 and concluded the Kansas v. Colorado litigation enforcing the Arkansas River Compact in 2009 in favor of Kansas. Barfield has worked to increase the development of groundwater modeling to analyze hydrologic conditions and for use as a tool to support decisions in water resource management. Barfield has ongoing dialogues with the Groundwater Management Districts and stakeholders regarding options to address areas with over appropriation of water resources, many of which are located in the Ogallala aquifer.

The church was licensed for marriages in 1845. The architect was William Conrad Lochner (c.1779-1861), surveyor to the Royal Exchange Assurance Co., who designed a church in a very similar style at de Beauvoir Town, Hackney, and restored St Andrew's church, Enfield. It was built from stock brick with stone dressings in a plain \\"Commissioners gothic\\" style with aisles and a western tower. Structural problems with the church soon emerged. In 1841 the Ecclesiologist magazine reported \\"St James Enfield Highway which has been consecrated six or eight years, is already condemned as 'dangerous', since the heavy tied roof is threatening to fall in from the rotting of the ends of the beams, which are said to have been laid in the most disgraceful manner upon the mere damp brick-work\\" The first incumumbent was T.W.

Eugen Relgis Eph√©m√©ride Anarchiste entry; retrieved 10 March 2011 (22 March 1895 ‚Äì 24 May 1987) was a Romanian writer, pacifist philosopher and anarchist militant, known as a theorist of humanitarianism. His internationalist dogma, with distinct echoes from Judaism and Jewish ethics, was first shaped during World War I, when Relgis was a conscientious objector. Infused with anarcho- pacifism and socialism, it provided Relgis with an international profile, and earned him the support of pacifists such as Romain Rolland, Stefan Zweig and Albert Einstein. Another, more controversial, aspect of Relgis' philosophy was his support for eugenics, which centered on the compulsory sterilization of \\"degenerates\\". The latter proposal was voiced by several of Relgis' essays and sociological tracts. After an early debut with Romania's Symbolist movement, Relgis promoted modernist literature and the poetry of Tudor Arghezi, signing his name to a succession of literary and political magazines. His work in fiction and poetry alternates the extremes of Expressionism and didactic art, giving artistic representation to his activism, his pacifist vision, or his struggle with a hearing impairment. He was a member of several modernist circles, formed around Romanian magazines such as SburƒÉtorul, Contimporanul or »òantier, but also close to the more mainstream journal Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ. His political and literary choices made Relgis an enemy of both fascism and communism: persecuted during World War II, he eventually took refuge in Uruguay. From 1947 to the moment of his death, Relgis earned the respect of South American circles as an anarchist commentator and proponent of solutions to world peace, as well as a promoter of Latin American culture. Biography =Early life and literary debut= The future Eugen Relgis was a native of Moldavia region, belonging to the local Jewish community.

L. Zissu. It was in Zissu's circle that Relgis probably first met his mentor, the Romanian modernist author Tudor Arghezi; at the time, Arghezi was married to Constan»õa Zissu, mother of his photographer son Eli Lotar.Cernat, p.56 The young writer later noted that he and Zissu were both touched by the wild landscape of the CeahlƒÉu Massif and Piatra's shtetl atmosphere. In another one of his texts, Relgis recalled having been influenced in childhood by selective readings from the Romanian Jewish scholar Moses Schwarzfeld and his Anuarul pentru Israeli»õi journal (he told that, during later years, he had collected the entire Anuarul collection).Dorian & »òerban, p.V Taking his first steps in literary life, Eisig Sigler adopted his new name through forms of wordplay which enjoyed some popularity among pseudonymous Jewish writers (the case of Paul Celan, born Ancel). Arnold Helman, Contribu»õia scriitorilor evrei la literatura rom√¢nƒÉ. Ilarie Voronca »ôi Paul Celan ‚Äì douƒÉ destine tragice, at the Romanian Jewish Community site ; retrieved March 10, 2011 He was from early on a promoter of Symbolist and modernist literature, a cause into which he blended his left-wing perspective and calls for Jewish emancipation. Writing in 2007, literary historian Paul Cernat suggested that Relgis, like fellow humanitarianist and Jewish intellectual Isac Ludo, had a \\"not at all negligible\\" part to play in the early diffusion of Romanian modernism.Cernat, p.34 Relgis' main contribution in the 1910s was the Symbolist tribune Fronda (\\"The Fronde\\"), the three consecutive issues of which he edited, in Ia»ôi, between April and June 1912.Cernat, p.55-57 Like Ludo's review Absolutio (which saw print two years later), Fronda stood for the radical branch of the Romanian Symbolist movement in Ia»ôi, in contrast to both the left-leaning but traditionalist magazine Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ and the more conventional Symbolism of Versuri »ôi ProzƒÉ journal.Cernat, p.55-56 Its editorial board, Relgis included, went anonymous, but their names were known to other periodicals of the day and to later researchers. According to Cernat, Relgis was \\"the most significant Frondiste\\", seconded by two future figures in Romanian Jewish journalism: Albert Schreiber and Carol Steinberg. Like Ludo and poet Benjamin Fondane, the Fronda group represented those Romanian Jewish aficionados in Ia»ôi who followed the Symbolist-modernist school of Arghezi, and who promoted Arghezi's poetry in northern Romania: Frondas writers were noted for saluting Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ when it too began hosting poems by Arghezi.Cernat, p.56, 57 Fronda put out three issues in all, after which time Relgis became an occasional contributor to more circulated periodicals, among them Rampa (founded by Arghezi and the socialist agitator N. D. Cocea) and Viea»õa NouƒÉ (led by Symbolist critic Ovid Densusianu). In 1913, he collected his loose philosophical essays, or \\"fantasies\\", in the volume Triumful nefiin»õei (\\"The Triumph of Non-Being\\"). Carte de neuitare a evreilor pietreni , at the Romanian Jewish Community site ; retrieved March 10, 2011Lovinescu, p.100; Rose, p.12 He published his first two books of poems during World War I, but before the end of Romania's neutrality period. The first one was a collection of sonnets, Sonetele nebuniei (\\"Sonnets of Madness\\"), printed at Ia»ôi in 1914; the second was published in the capital, Bucharest, as Nebunia (\\"Madness\\").CƒÉlinescu, p.1029 Some of these poems were illustrated with drawings in Relgis' own hand. =From Umanitatea to M√¢ntuirea= After training in architecture, Relgis was enrolled at the University of Bucharest, where he took courses in Philosophy. During the period, he first left Romania on a trip to the Ottoman Empire and Kingdom of Greece. He interrupted his studies shortly after Romania entered the war, in the second half of 1916. Back in Ia»ôi after the Central Powers stormed into southern Romania, he was reportedly drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, but refused to take up arms as a conscientious objector; briefly imprisoned as a result, he was in the end discharged for his deafness. Resuming his publishing activity upon the end of war, Eugen Relgis began publicizing his humanitarianist and pacifist agenda. In summer 1918, Relgis became one of the contributors to the Ia»ôi-based review Umanitatea (\\"The Humanity\\" or \\"The Human Race\\"). Historian Lucian Boia, who notes that Umanitatea was published when Romania's temporary defeat seemed to announce sweeping political reforms, believes that the magazine mainly reflected the \\"nebulous\\" agenda of a senior editor, the Bessarabian journalist Alexis Nour.Boia, p.259-260 In addition to Relgis and Nour, Umanitatea enlisted contributions from Ludo and Avram Steuerman-Rodion.Boia, p.260 The short-lived magazine, Boia writes, supported land reform, labor rights and, unusually in the context of \\"pronounced Romanian antisemitism\\", Jewish emancipation. On his own, Relgis published a magazine of the same title, issued during 1920.Dorian & »òerban, p.II According to one account, Umanitatea was closed down by Romania's military censorship, which kept a check on radical publications. In 1921, an unsigned chronicle in the Cluj-based G√¢ndirea journal recognized in Relgis \\"the kind and enthusiastic young man who was propagating [...] the religion of man through Umanitatea magazine\\". \\"CƒÉr»õi »ôi reviste. G. Fr. Nicolai, Biologia rƒÉzboiului\\", in G√¢ndirea, Nr. 3/1921, p.54 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Relgis resumed his literary activity early in the interwar period. He authored his ideological essay Literatura rƒÉzboiului »ôi era nouƒÉ (Bucharest, 1919); another such piece, Umanitarism sau Interna»õionala intelectualilor (\\"Humanitarianism or the Intellectuals' Internationale\\"), taken up by Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ in 1922.Dora Litani-Littman, Abraham Feller, \\"Relgis (Sigler), Eugen\\", Encyclopaedia Judaica entry (republished by the Jewish Virtual Library); retrieved March 10, 2011 Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ also published Relgis' abridged translation of The Biology of War, a pacifist treatise by German physician Georg Friedrich Nicolai. 1922 witnessed the birth of Relgis' manifesto Principiile umanitariste (\\"Humanitarianist Principles\\"), which offered Relgis' own conclusions on world peace, while reaffirming the need to create an international pacifist forum of intellectuals. It carried a preface by Nicolai. Relgis also set up the First Humanitarianist Group of Romania, as well as a leftist library, Biblioteca Cercului Libertatea (\\"Freedom Circle Library\\"). Joined in such efforts by the veteran anarchists Han Ryner and Panait Mu»ôoiu, Relgis also circulated an Apel cƒÉtre to»õi intelectualii liberi »ôi muncitorii lumina»õi (\\"Appeal to All the Free Intellectuals and the Enlightened Workers\\"). Before 1932, the Humanitarianist Group created some 23 regional branches in Greater Romania. Beginning 1925, Relgis also represented Romanian pacifists within the War Resisters' International. In the meantime, he continued to publish sporadic poems, such as Ascetism (\\"Asceticism\\"), featured in G√¢ndirea. Eugen Relgis, \\"Ascetism\\", in G√¢ndirea, Nr. 10/1921, p.189 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) The year 1923 witnessed the beginnings of a friendship between Relgis and the aspiring pacifist author George Mihail Zamfirescu. Relgis prefaced Zamfirescu's book Flamura albƒÉ (\\"The White Flag\\"), and contributed to Zamfirescu's magazine Icoane Maramure»ôene (\\"Maramure»ô Icons\\"). Mircea Popa, \\"George Mihail Zamfirescu\\", in the December 1 University of Alba Iulia Philologica Yearbook, 2006, I, p.30 A prose volume, PeregrinƒÉri (\\"Wanderings\\"), saw print with Editura Socec the same year. Relgis also published, in 1924, the 3 volumes of his main novel Petru Arbore (a Bildungsroman named after its main protagonist).CƒÉlinescu, p.1029; Lovinescu, p.237-238; Rose, p.12 Two new volumes of his topical essays saw print in later years: the first one, published by the printing offices of fellow journalist Barbu BrƒÉni»ôteanu, was Umanitarism »ôi socialism (\\"Humanitarianism and Socialism\\", 1925); the second, printed in 1926, was titled Umanitarismul biblic (\\"Humanitarianism in the Bible\\"). His press activity included contributions to Zionist papers: a writer for »òtiri din Lumea EvreiascƒÉ, he was also briefly on the staff of Zissu's M√¢ntuirea. =SburƒÉtorul and Umanitarismul= Also during the early 1920s, Eugen Relgis came into contact with the Bucharest-based SburƒÉtorul circle, which stood for modernist literature and aesthetic relativism. The eponymous magazine published samples of his lyrical poetry. With his humanitarian literature, Relgis was a singular figure among the many SburƒÉtorul factions, as later noted by literary historian Ovid CrohmƒÉlniceanu in discussing the studied eclecticism of SburƒÉtorul doyen Eugen Lovinescu.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.24 Another Romanian researcher, Henri Zalis, notes that Relgis was one of the many Jewish intellectuals whom Lovinescu cultivated in reaction to the tradition of ethno- nationalist discrimination. Henri Zalis, \\"Apropieri de o mo»ôtenire diferen»õiatƒÉ\\" , in Convorbiri Literare, August 2004 However, according to critic Eugen Simion, Lovinescu also greatly exaggerated Relgis' literary worth.Simion, in Lovinescu, p.328 Relgis' contribution to Romanian literature was renewed in 1926, when he published Melodiile tƒÉcerii (\\"Melodies of Silence\\") and the collection Poezii (\\"Poems\\"), followed in 1927 by Glasuri √Æn surdinƒÉ (\\"Muted Voices\\"). The latter novel, later republished with a foreword by Austrian author Stefan Zweig,Rose, p.12 Archivi di personalit√†.

His pieces for AdevƒÉrul include insights into medical sociology, such as the September 1922 √énapoi, la biologie! (\\"Back to Biology!\\"). P.

Simion DƒÉnƒÉilƒÉ, Titus Cri»ôciu, \\"Nu po»õi sƒÉ fi filozof fƒÉrƒÉ a fi pedepsit\\", in Orizont, Nr. 10 p.4 Relgis' work as a translator also included versions of writings by Zweig, √âmile Armand, Selma Lagerl√∂f, Emil Ludwig and Jakob Wassermann. After editing the short-lived gazette Cugetul Liber (\\"Freethought\\"), Eugen Relgis put out the political and cultural review Umanitarismul (\\"Humanitarianism\\"). It enlisted contributions from the Romanian writers Ion Barbu, Alexandru Al. Philippide and Ion Vinea, and was positively reviewed by other cultural figures (Tudor Arghezi, Enric FurtunƒÉ, Meyer Abraham Halevy, Perpessicius).Dorian & »òerban, p.II, VII He published his work in a variety of periodicals, from Vinea's modernist mouthpiece Contimporanul,Contimporanul , Dada & Modernist Magazines entry; retrieved March 10, 2011 Ludo's Adam review Geo »òerban, \\"De la Adam citire.

Ion Mu»ôlea, \\"Buletin bibliografic VIII. Micelanee\\", in Societatea de M√¢ine, Nr. 12-13/1929, p.224 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) The same year, Relgis lectured at the Zionist Avodah circle about the opportunities of Jewish return to the Land of Israel. =Travels abroad and »òantier affiliation= The Romanian writer traveled extensively to promote his ideas of social change. By 1928, he was in regular correspondence with French writer and human rights activist Romain Rolland, who answered in writing to Relgis' various inquiries.Duchatelet, p.41 He was a delegate to pacifist reunions in Hoddesdon, England and Sonntagberg, Austria (1928). Relgis also exchanged letters with various other prestigious left-wing intellectuals: Zweig, Upton Sinclair, Henri Barbusse, Max Nettlau etc. His various inquiries also enlisted positive replies from other international supporters of pacifism: physicist Albert Einstein, biologist Auguste Forel, writer Heinrich Mann and anarchist militant Paul Reclus. He became a contributor to Sebastien Faure's Anarchist Encyclopedia, with the \\"Humanitarianism\\" entry. In 1929, Delpeuch company published his French- language essay L'Internationale pacifiste (\\"The Pacifist International\\"),Duchatelet, p.33, 41 reissued the same year in Valencia, Spain, as La Internacional Pacifista. Around 1930, Relgis was in Paris, where he met with Han Ryner, and in Berlin, where he conversed with his mentor Nicolai.Rose, p.13 In its new translated editions, Apel cƒÉtre... was signed by a number of leading pacifist intellectuals of various persuasions, among them Zweig, Sinclair, Barbusse, Campio Carpio, Manuel Devald√®s, Phil√©as Lebesgue, Rabindranath Tagore. While in France, where his work was notably popularized by L'EnDehors magazine and G√©rard de Lacaze-Duthiers's Biblioth√®que de l'Artistocratie book collection, he was for a while close to Barbusse's Clart√© circle, but left it after discovering its communist militancy and Soviet connections. His Intellectuals' Internationale therefore took distance from both the Comintern and the International Working Union of Socialist Parties. In 1932, he published the German-language collection of interviews Wege zum Friede (\\"Path toward Peace\\"). His other travels into Bulgaria, where he represented Romanian vegetarians at an international congress, were discussed in his 1933 volume Bulgaria necunoscutƒÉ (\\"Unknown Bulgaria\\").Clopo»õel (1933), passim The volume Cosmomet√°polis, about the creation of a world government,Joseph Preston Baratta, The Politics of World Federation: From World Federation to Global Governance, Greenwood Publishing Group, Vol. 2, Westport, 2004, p.638. was first published in Bucharest by Cultura Poporului imprint, and reissued in Paris by Mignolet et Storz.

Catalogue des ouvrages parus en langue fran√ßaise dans le monde entier, Hachette, Paris, 1936, p.47, 187, 636 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library) Relgis' participation in left-wing causes was attacked at home by the antisemitic and proto-fascist National Christian Defense League, whose press organ √énfrƒÉ»õirea Rom√¢neascƒÉ alleged that \\"squire Siegler\\" and his Umanitarismul, together with the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, were fostering communist agitation. Ion V. Emilian, \\"IarƒÉ»ôi Liga Drepturilor Omului\\", in √énfrƒÉ»õirea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Nr. 20/192, p.235 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) After the 1933 establishment of a Nazi regime in Germany, Relgis' books of interviews became subject to ceremonial burnings. By that moment in his career, Relgis became a contributor to Vremea newspaper and to Ion Pas' political and art magazine, »òantier. \\"Bibliografie\\", in Societatea de M√¢ine, Nr. 10-11/1933, p.182 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) The latter periodical was close to the Romanian Social Democratic Party, and had a strongly anti-fascist agenda.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.159-161 It published, in 1932, the Relgis essay Europa cea t√¢nƒÉrƒÉ (\\"Young Europe\\"), which talked about civilization, imperialism and war.Dorian & »òerban, p.VII Relgis' contributions to »òantier also include a January 12, 1934 essay about \\"anonymous works\\" and their impact on art history, which was later quoted in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ.\\"Revista revistelor\\", in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Nr. 1/1934, p.60 The same year, Relgis published the novel Prieteniile lui Miron (\\"Miron's Friendships\\") with Editura Cugetarea. Ion Clopo»õel, \\"Discu»õii »ôi recensii. Eugen Relgis: Prieteniile lui Miron\\", in Societatea de M√¢ine, Nr. 7-10/1934, p.150 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) In his subsequent activity as a journalist and publisher, Relgis combined his humanitarianism with topical interests. He was by then an advocate of eugenics, an interest reflected in his 1934 (or 1935) tract Umanitarism »ôi eugenism (\\"Humanitarianism and Eugenism\\"), published by Editura Vegetarianismul company.Bucur, p.187, 282; Turda, p.93 In 1936, he also released the collection Esseuri despre iudaism (\\"Essays on Judaism\\") with Cultura Poporului.Dorian & »òerban, p.II, V He was at the time active within the Jewish Cultural Institute, an annex of the Bucharest Choral Temple. His international activity peaked during the Spanish Civil War, when he helped organize anarchist support for the Spanish Republican regime, elected Councilor of the International Antifascist Solidarity. =World War II, persecution and departure= Eugen Relgis was still active on the literary scene during the first two years of World War II, before Romania formalized its military alliance with the Axis Powers. The Phoney War caught him in France, but he returned to Romania shortly after, exposing himself to persecution by the growing Romanian fascist movements. In February 1940, he gave a retrospective lecture, republished by the newspaper L'Ind√©pendence Roumaine, on the work of Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud.Archive Catalogues. Press Cuttings, Freud Museum archive; retrieved March 7, 2011 Another book of his political prose, Spiritul activ (\\"The Active Spirit\\"), saw print the same year. The emergence of antisemitic and fascist regimes (see Romania in World War II, Holocaust in Romania) signified the beginning of Relgis' marginalization. During the short-lived National Legionary State, established by the Iron Guard fascists between 1940 and early 1941, the author lived in seclusion. His Biblioteca Cercului Libertatea was banned in 1940, but Relgis secretly moved the books into a stable. After the Guard fell from power, the Ion Antonescu dictatorship still included Relgis on a nationally circulated list of banned Romanian Jewish authors,Rotman, p.174-175 but Relgis continued to write. His texts of the time include a posthumous praise of his pacifist disciple Iosif Gutman, the son of a Bucharest rabbi, who had been killed during the Bucharest pogrom. The essay was planned as part of Rabbi Gutman's volume Slove de martiri (\\"Notes by Martyrs\\"), which, although anti- Guard, was not given Antonescu's imprimatur. Relgis was however able to publish an article in the Jewish-only magazine Rena»ôterea NoastrƒÉ, on the occasion of Iosif's yahrtzeit, where he compared the Gutmans to Laoco√∂n and His Sons. \\"21‚Äì23 ianuarie 1941. Rememorare din unghi contemporan\\", in Realitatea EvreiascƒÉ, Nr. 310-311 (1110‚Äì1111), December 2008 ‚Äì January 2009, p.4 Relgis' own son fled Romania in 1942, and settled in Argentina. A final period in Relgis' Romanian activity came after the August 1944 Coup toppled Antonescu and denounced Romania's Axis alliance. In 1945, he was dedicated a public celebration at the Jewish Cultural Institute, which included a speech by Chief Rabbi Alexandru »òafran. Institutul Cultural al Templului Coral. Un institut care ar merita sƒÉ renascƒÉ , at the Romanian Jewish Community site ; retrieved March 10, 2011 Slove de martiri was eventually published that year, and a revised Romanian edition of Petru Arbore saw print in 1946. Also then, he completed work on an essay about Nazism, The Holocaust and sexuality: Eros √Æn al treilea Reich (\\"Eros in the Third Reich\\").Oi»ôteanu, p.69, 125 Relgis was again active in the political press, lending his signature to several independent newspapers: Sebastian »òerbescu's Semnalul, Tudor Teodorescu- Brani»ôte's Jurnalul de Diminea»õƒÉ etc.Dorian & »òerban, p.VI He described himself as diametrically opposed to the process of communization, as well as to the Soviet occupation of Romania. With refugee status, having reportedly been singled out for arrest by the Romanian Communist Party officials, Relgis departed from Romania in 1947, shortly before the communist regime took hold. After a brief stay in Paris, he spent some time in Argentina, with his son and his female companion Ana Taubes. He later went to Montevideo, in Uruguay, where he lived the remainder of his life. At home, his works were included in an official Publica»õii interzise (\\"Works Forbidden from Publishing\\") list, published by the communist censorship apparatus. Al. SƒÉndulescu, \\"Cum se distruge o culturƒÉ\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 27/2003 During his last decades, Eugen Relgis dedicated himself to sociological research and political activism. He embarked on a series of university lectures, which carried him throughout Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil. In 1950, he founded an international anarchist archive in Montevideo, reportedly one of the few political libraries in South America at the time of its creation. Roberto Ceamanos Llorens, \\"Los estudios en el extranjero como per√≠odo formativo. La experiencia del historiador y soci√≥logo Carlos M. Rama en Francia y Espa√±a\\", in Universidad de Montevideo Humanidades, Nr. 1/2007, p.128; Carlos M. Rama, \\"Page Internationale. L'Histoire sociale en Uruguay\\", in Actualit√© de l'Histoire, Nr. 3/1954, p.44 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library) The effort was supported by the exiled Spanish anarchist Abraham Guill√©n, and received documentary funds from Europe, but reputedly drew suspicion from Uruguay police forces, and was consequently shut down. =South American career= With noted help from anarchist translator Vladimiro Mu√±oz, Relgis began his new career as a Spanish-language writer and publicist with a succession of works. Umanitarism »ôi eugenism was translated into a Spanish edition: Humanitarismo y eugenismo, Ediciones Universo, Toulouse, 1950. Ana Esmeralda Rizo L√≥pez, \\"Apuntes sobre la comunidad gitana espa√±ola: breves trazos de su historia en conexi√≥n con el contexto europeo\\", in the University of Costa Rica Di√°logos. Revista Electr√≥nica de Historia, Nr. 1/2005, p.226 (Redalyc version) The same imprint released his essay Las aberraciones sexuales en la Alemania nazi (\\"Sexual Aberrations in Nazi Germany\\"), which discussed in some depth the characteristics of Nazi eugenics. Also in 1950, with his Montevideo printing office Ediciones Humanidad, Relgis released a Spanish edition of his Principiile, a version of Max Nettlau's World Peace volume, as well as reissuing Cosmomet√°polis. Two years later, Ediciones Humanidad published Relgis' biographical essay Stefan Zweig, cazador de almas (\\"Stefan Zweig, the Soul Hunter\\"), followed in 1953 by a Hachette version of De mis peregrinaciones europeas (\\"From My Wanderings in Europe\\"). Relgis also tried to get his contributions translated into Portuguese, asking anarchist philosopher Jos√© Oiticica for assistance. He was at the time employed by El Plata daily, editing its Wednesday literary page, and helping to discover, in 1954, the twelve-year-old poet Teresa Porzecanski.Teresa Porzecanski, \\"Uruguay. A Story in Episodes\\", in Marjorie Agos√≠n, Taking Root: Narratives of Jewish Women in Latin America, Ohio University Press, Athens, 2002, p.226. In 1954, Relgis printed another biographical study, on Romain Rolland: El hombre libre frente a la barbarie totalitaria (\\"A Free Man Confronts Totalitarian Barbarity\\").Duchatelet, p.23, 41 The following year, he gave a public lecture at the University of the Republic, titled \\"A Writer's Confession\\", and reissued Esseuri despre iudaism as Profetas y poetas. Valores permanentes y temporarios del juda√≠smo (\\"Prophets and Poets. The Permanent and Timely Values of Judaism\\"). A Spanish version of Umanitarism sau Interna»õionala intelectualilor was published, as El Humanitarismo, by Editorial Americalee in Buenos Aires (1956). One edition of the latter was prefaced by Nicolai, who was at the time living in Argentina.Cappelletti, p.LXXVII In November 1956, the same company issued Relgis' Diario de oto√±o (\\"Autumn Diary\\"), a collection of notes he had kept during the war years. Another tract, Albores de libertad (\\"Dawns of Freedom\\"), was prefaced by Rudolf Rocker, the anarcho-syndicalist thinker. In 1958, the University of the Republic published Eugen Relgis' acclaimed political essay Perspectivas culturales en Sudam√©rica (\\"Cultural Perspectives in South America\\"), for which he received a prize from the Uruguayan Ministry of Public Instruction and Social Prevision. Relgis' reputation was consolidated in the intellectual circles and, in 1955, his name was unsuccessfully advanced for the Nobel Peace Prize. Sanda-Valeria Moraru, \\"Recenzii. Mircea Popa, ContinuitƒÉ»õi\\", in the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Ephemerides, Nr. 2/2010, p.151 The same year, a volume of his collected Spanish texts and studies on his work was published in Montevideo, as Homenaje a Eugen Relgis en su 60¬∫ aniversario (\\"Homage to Eugen Relgis on His 60th Anniversary\\"). Relgis returned to poetry in 1960 and 1961, with the volumes En un lugar de los Andes (\\"Some Place in the Andes\\") and Locura (\\"Madness\\"), both translated by Pablo R. Troise. They were followed by two other booklets, also in Troise's translation: Corazones y motores (\\"Hearts and Engines\\", 1963), √öltimos poemas (\\"The Last Poems\\", 1967). His complete Obras (\\"Works\\") were published over the next decades, while the essay ¬øQu√© es el humanitarismo? Principios y acci√≥n (\\"What Is Humanitarianism? Principles and Action\\") went through several successive editions and featured a prologue by Albert Einstein. Another one of Relgis' Spanish-language volumes, Testigo de mi tiempo (\\"A Witness of My Time\\"), with more essays on Judaism, came in 1961. His leading eugenics and sexology treatise, Historia sexual de la Humanidad (\\"The Sexual History of Humanity\\"), was also published in 1961 (Libro-Mex Editores, Mexico City),Masjuan, p.407, 422, 424, 493 and, in 1965, his biography of Nicolai saw print in Buenos Aires.Cappelletti, p.LXI =Final years and death= In 1962, Eugen Relgis visited Israel and Jerusalem, tightening his links with the Romanian Israeli community, including the Menora Association and Rabbi David »òafran.Dorian & »òerban, p.II, VIII It was in Israel that Relgis published another volume of memoirs, in his native Romanian language: MƒÉrturii de ieri »ôi de azi (\\"Testimonies of Yesterday and Today\\"). In 1972, he was made an honorary staff member of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. From the early 1960s, Relgis was in correspondence with figures in the Italian radical circles, such as the anarchist Gaspare Mancuso. In 1964, Mancuso and Regis' other Italian disciples founded the political journal Quaderini degli amici di Eugen Relgis (\\"The Friends of Eugen Relgis Notebooks\\"). He also became an occasional contributor to Mujeres Libres, the Spanish anarcha-feminist tribune in the United Kingdom.Luis Monferrer Catal√°n, Odisea en Albi√≥n: los republicanos espa√±oles exiliados en Gran Breta√±a 1936‚Äì1977, Ediciones de la Torre, Madrid, 2007, p. 459. During the 1960s and '70s, as a spell of liberalization occurred in Nicolae Ceau»ôescu's Romania, Relgis was again in contact with Romanian intellectuals. Before the massive earthquake of 1977 devastated Bucharest, he was in regular correspondence with scholar Mircea Handoca. Eugen Relgis lived the final decade of his life as a pensioner of the Uruguayan state‚Äîin 1985, a law raised his pensi√≥n graciable to 20,000 new pesos a month. In the 1980s, Relgis was exchanging letters with Romanian cultural historian Leon Volovici, and entertained thoughts about a recovery of his work by Romanian critics and historians. He died before this could happen, in Montevideo, at age 92. Political doctrine =Main ideas= Throughout his career, Relgis was the proponent of anarchism. The Romanian writer spoke about the negativity of \\"state fetishism\\", seeking to overturn it and create \\"universal fraternity\\",CƒÉlinescu, p.937 and, in Diario de oto√±o, postulated a necessary distinction between Law (\\"which may be interpreted for or against\\") and Justice (\\"elementary\\" and unavoidable). Relgis likewise believed that war could be overcome once humanity shall have toppled \\"the three idols: State, Property, Money.\\" Political philosopher √Ångel Cappelletti argues: \\"Relgis was not an anarchist militant, but was always close to libertarian ideas\\". According to Stefan Zweig, Relgis fought \\"tirelessly for the great goal of spiritual fraternity.\\" The sentiment was echoed by Romain Rolland, who recognized in Relgis his disciple: \\"There is no other European man in whose hands I could place, with as much confidence, [...] my pacifist and universalist idea, for it to be passed on into the future. For none other has such far-reaching intelligence to this goal, and none other would feel this idea so intimately connected to his being.\\"Dorian & »òerban, p.I Speaking from the cultural mainstream, Romanian literary historian George CƒÉlinescu observed Relgis' anti-establishment and anti-artistic rhetoric, but described it as mere \\"idealist reverie\\", \\"without any daring proposals that would threaten our self-preservation instincts\\". Contrarily, scholar William Rose sees Relgis as \\"an idealist deeply preoccupied by social problems\\", \\"a practical and not a utopian thinker\\", and a theorist aware that social or economic evolution was needed before his goals could be achieved. Relgis' humanitarianism (also known as humanism or pan-humanism; )Rose, p.12. See also Dorian & »òerban, p.VII was a practical extension of anarcho-pacifism. William Rose describes this doctrine as both \\"universalist and pacifist\\", noting that one of its leading purposes was to eliminate those things \\"which separate man from man and cause wars\\". Relgis himself spoke of his movement as a form of \\"active thought\\", and \\"a critical method applied to natural, human and social realities\\", while expressing admiration for the nonviolent resistance tactics advocated in British India by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi or Rabindranath Tagore. At the time, he attacked all forms of pan-nationalism, from Pan-Germanism to Pan-European nationalism, defining pan-humanism as \\"the only 'pan' that can be accepted as a natural law of the human species\\". In El humanitarismo, he called all internationalist movements, except his own, corrupted by \\"the practice of violence and intolerance\\". Writing in 1933, the leftist literary columnist Ion Clopo»õel stressed that Relgis' vision combined humanitarianism with \\"a lively, dynamic and innovating socialism\\".Clopo»õel (1933), p.169 Although left-wing, Relgis' vision also incorporated militant anti-communism. As noted by literary historian Geo »òerban, he was from early on skeptical about the outcome of \\"social revolutions\\" and Bolshevik insurgency. In the first issue of Umanitarianismul, Relgis criticized both the far right and the far left, noting that his ideology was \\"apolitical, in fact antipolitical\\". In Europa cea t√¢nƒÉrƒÉ, he referred to the Soviet Union as the home of \\"proletarian imperialism\\". These thoughts were detailed by Diario de oto√±o, which drew a direct comparison between the Red Army, pushing Romania into an \\"armed peace\\", and the Wehrmacht. =Judaism, Zionism, Jewish culture= Beginning in the late 1920s, Relgis was also a supporter of Zionism, convinced that the path of Jewish assimilation was unsatisfactory for the affirmation of Jewish talents. He also adhered to philosopher Martin Buber's ideas about reuniting the three paths chosen by diaspora Jews: universalism, Zionism and Conservative Judaism. In his 1929 Avodah conference, he analyzed the ongoing Jewish resettlement into the Land of Israel, and investigated the causes of violent clashes between Jewish migrants and the Palestine Arabs. In other public statements, Relgis proudly stated his Judaic faith, noting that he had never actually left Judaism, \\"being integrated into its vast reality by the very reality of my own preoccupations, sociological and ethical, humanitarianist and pacifist.\\" However, he explained to Iosif Gutman that joining a Zionist organization was not worth the effort, since membership was a form of captivity, and elsewhere suggested that Zionism was justified only as long as it did not follow \\"the restrictive methods of vulgar nationalism.\\" The writer also described himself as committed to Romanian culture, and, as late as 1981, noted that Romanian was still his language of choice. His essays on Judaism (some of which were dedicated to his father David) speak about the threat of societal collapse, which the author connected with mankind's spiritual decline after World War I. His theory on \\"dehumanization\\" postulated: \\"the spiritual evolution of mankind has proceeded to descent just as mankind is progressing in material terms.\\" As a reversal of this trend, Relgis proposed a return to the roots of Judaism, in whose monotheism and Messianism he decoded the basic representation of moral responsibility, and the immediate precursors of Christianity. The Romanian writer was interested in those aspects of Jewish ethics which anticipated humanitarianism or pacifism, citing the Bible as \\"that most humane book\\", and identifying himself with the lament of Malachi 2:10 (\\"Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?\\"). He later wrote that Jews, and Israelis in particular, were entrusted with keeping alive \\"the ancient wisdom, poetry and faith\\", with creating \\"new values from the old ones\\". Defining in his own terms the relationship between Biblical proto-universalism and 20th century humanitarianism, Relgis wrote: \\"Judaism is comprised into modern humanitarianism like a flame within a crystal globe.\\" In tandem, he rejected those aspects of Judaism or Christianity which he believed where bigotry, and his pacifist discourse criticized all religions as potential instigators or ideological props of hawkish rhetoric. He reserved special criticism for the notions of a \\"vengeful God\\" and \\"Jewish chosenness\\", arguing that they are \\"primitive\\", and expressed more sympathy for Buddhist universalism. His texts, including the 1922 Apel cƒÉtre..., are thought by some to be purposefully reusing the pro-universalist vocabulary of Freemasons. Relgis' Judaic-themed tracts cover a wide range of subjects. In several of them, Relgis concentrates on the Biblical prophet Moses, in whom he sees the symbol of \\"great human aspirations\\". Some texts trace the impact of Moses' teaching on more modern authors (from Baruch Spinoza to Charles Darwin), others talk about secular Jewish culture, and still others focus on individual Jewish personalities: Buber, Edmond Fleg, Theodor Herzl. As a critic, he also investigated the survival of ancient Judaic themes in the modern art of Marcel Janco, LazƒÉr Zin or Reuven Rubin, and in the literature of Zweig, S. Ansky, Mendele Mocher Sforim and even Marcel Proust. Other such writings are individual portraits of Romanian Jewish men of letters, from A. L. Zissu and Iosif Bruc«ér to Avram Steuerman-Rodion and Enric FurtunƒÉ. According to Geo »òerban, Relgis spent much of his later career promoting \\"a more fertile awareness of the links between Judaism and the modern world.\\" A critic of antisemitism, Eugen Relgis also dedicated some of his main works in the essay genre to the cause of anti- fascism. Early on, he exposed claims about Judeo-Masonic domination as canards, and noted that antisemitism was a negative reaction to the Jews' own status as natural innovators in both politics and culture. He wrote: \\"I take antisemitism to be that psychological disease whose manifestations display the characteristics of a phobia, that is to say an obsession. When someone is obsessed with an image, an individual or even a collective entity, these become the center of their world‚Äîand all causes and effects, no matter how far apart and different from each other, are connected to the initial obsession.\\" Writing in 1946, shortly after the scale of The Holocaust became known to Romanian Jews, Relgis gave credit to the popular, but since challenged rumor that Nazis fabricated human soap.Oi»ôteanu, p.69 Historian of ideas Andrei Oi»ôteanu analyzes Relgis' text as more of a reaction to Nazism's own obsessive take on cleanliness, and writes that, at that time, Jews and Christians in Romania had been collecting certain brands of German soap and burying them as human remains.Oi»ôteanu, p.69-70 =On Latin America= After his move to Uruguay, Relgis developed a personal theory on Latin America as a \\"neohumanist\\" continent.Riose, passim Earlier, in Europa cea t√¢nƒÉrƒÉ, Relgis had claimed that the European continent needed to revisit its \\"pathetic history\\" of violence and imperialism, and reconvert by combining the lessons of Eastern philosophy and United States models of industrialization. Both models, he warned, carried risks: Asia's \\"spiritual renunciations\\" were mirrored by a \\"cancer of machinism\\" in North America. With Perspectivas culturales en Sudam√©rica, he expanded on a distinction between civilization and culture: the former as a transitory phase in human development, the latter as a permanent and characteristic sum of ideas; civilization, he argued, was in existence within the New World, but a Latin American culture was still ahead.Rose, p.12-13 Relgis identified this as a merit, describing South America in general and Uruguay in particular as exceptionally fertile and a \\"healthier\\" example for the whole world, offering safe haven to independent thinkers and defying the ideological divisions of the Cold War era.Rose, p.13-14 Summarizing the future links between the Latin American regions and Europe as envisaged by Relgis, William Rose wrote: \\"the cultural mission of America consists in a careful selection of the eternal and universal values of Europe and their assimilation [...] to create typically American values that later, transcending the limits of this continent, will carry their message of peace and fraternity to the entire world.\\" Latin America, Relgis cautioned, should leave behind its own traditions of dictatorial government, fanaticism and \\"utilitarian mentality\\", while fighting the \\"false moral\\" of North America; it could thus contribute to the cultural renaissance of a Europe corrupted by totalitarianism and imperialism. Also important in Relgis' assessment was Latin America's capacity to resist modern dehumanization by granting a social role to its intellectuals, an idea impressed upon him by the writings of Uruguayan humanist Jos√© Enrique Rod√≥.Rose, p.14 Relgis' theory was received with interest by some of his South American colleagues. One was Argentine poet and historian Arturo Capdevila, who wrote about Relgis as a \\"meritorious\\" visionary with a \\"grave and vital message\\", assuring him: \\"You can say from now on that you did not suffer in vain, gravely and deeply, the sorrows of the spirit. Your voice will be heard; all of your lesson will be applied.\\" Those Uruguayan public figures who paid homage to Relgis on his 60th anniversary included Socialist Party leader Emilio Frugoni, Colorado Party politician Am√≠lcar Vasconcellos, Zionist academic Joel Gak and poet Carlos Sabat Ercasty. While comparing Relgis' pacifist message with the legendary warnings of Antigone, Frugoni's praise was somewhat skeptical, noting that the Romanian's projects, however grand, could find themselves in disagreement with \\"the constricting reality\\". Reviewing such appraisals, Uruguayan philosopher Agust√≠n Courtoisie calls Relgis \\"eccentric and genial\\", and sees in him a real-life version of characters in Jorge Luis Borges' fantasy literature. =Eugenics= Like other intellectuals of his generation, Eugen Relgis believed that biology served to explain the background of \\"social and cultural problems that influence the intellectual movement.\\" Controversially, he merged his anarchist perspective with support for eugenics, advocating universal birth control and compulsory sterilization in cases of \\"degeneration\\".Turda, p.93-94 According to Agust√≠n Courtoisie: \\"Anarchist pacifism and the once fashionable eugenics seem to be the concepts one can associate with [Relgis]\\". In favoring this option, Relgis identified himself with those of his anarchist forerunners who were also dedicated neo-Malthusians, and especially with Manuel Devald√®s. He praised Devald√®s' call for vasectomy as a regulatory practice, calling the procedure \\"a true revolution\\" in population growth. His works defended other anarchists who recommended the practice, including the tried anarchist eugenists Norbert Bardoseck and Pierre Ramus.Masjuan, p.406-407 According to Romanian biomedicine historian Marius Turda, Relgis was among the social scientists who, in 1930s Romania, \\"forced [eugenic sterilization] into the realm of public debate\\".Turda, p.93 Turda also notes that Umanitarism »ôi eugenism went beyond sterilization advocacy to propose the involuntary euthanasia of \\"degenerate\\" individuals: those with \\"pathological characteristics or incurable diseases.\\" Relgis' call to action in eugenics came with a provision: \\"It is, however, preferable, from all points of view, that degenerates should not be born, or, even better, not conceived.\\" His views on this subject included an economic rationale, since, he argued, the community could not be expected to provide for sexually \\"prolific\\", but otherwise \\"degenerate\\", individuals. To this goal, he supported abortion, both for eugenic and pro-choice reasons. Relgis also argued: \\"Instead of natural selection, man should practice rational selection.\\"Bucur, p.187 With Las aberraciones sexuales..., Relgis condemned Nazi eugenics as barbaric, but agreed that those identified as \\"sub-humans\\" needed to be reeducated and (if \\"incurable\\") sterilized by non-Nazi physicians. In this context, Relgis identified multiracial society as a positive paradigm. The emergence of an exemplary Latin American culture was conceived by Relgis as running parallel to a future American racial type. In this, Relgis saw the \\"integral man\\" of his humanitarianism, \\"healthy and strong\\", with a mind unbound by \\"super- refined culture\\", and without the traumatic experience of \\"tyrannical ideologies\\". The idea, Rose noted, was somewhat similar to, but \\"more universal\\" than, the Cosmic Race theory of Mexican academic Jos√© Vasconcelos. Literary contribution =Literary style and principles= Eugen Relgis blended a critique of capitalism, advocacy of internationalism and modern art interest with all his main contributions to literature. In his essays and \\"all too cerebral\\" novels, George CƒÉlinescu argues, Eugen Relgis was \\"obsessed with humanitarianism\\" and self-help techniques. With his 1934 piece for »òantier, Relgis divided the experience and nature of art into a primordial, collective, form and a newer, individualist one: in the past, Relgis noted, creativity was consumed into creating vast anonymous works (\\"the pyramid, the temple, the cathedral\\"), often demanding \\"the silent and tenacious effort of successive generations.\\" Presently, he thought, the combat against the \\"imperative of Profit\\" and \\"vulgar materialism\\" justified the \\"ethical and aesthetic individualism\\". Relgis' essay described industrial society in harsh terms, as directed by \\"the bloody gods\\" of \\"Capitalism and War\\", and cautioned that the advocacy of anonymity in modern art could lead to kitsch (\\"serialized production, without the significance it used to carry in bygone days\\"). Elsewhere, however, Relgis also argued that books needed to have a formative value, and that literature, unlike journalism, \\"needs to be the expression of length and depth.\\" Some of Relgis' preferences were shaped from his time at Fronda. Its art manifestos, described by Paul Cernat as \\"virtually illegible\\", announced radical ideals, such as art for art's sake through Neronian destruction: Qualis artifex pereo. Leon Baconsky, a historian of Romanian Symbolism, notes that all Frondistes were at the time enthusiastic followers of French literary theorist Remy de Gourmont, to whom Cernat adds philosopher Henri Bergson and Epicurean thinker Jean-Marie Guyau (both of them dedicated \\"prolix-metaphoric commentary\\" in the review's pages). In matters of poetics, the group declared its deep admiration for the loose Symbolism of Tudor Arghezi (whose poems were amply reviewed by all three Fronda issues) and, to a lesser extent, Ion Minulescu‚Äîaccording to Baconsky, Fronda was the first-ever voice in literary criticism to comment on Arghezi's work as an integral phenomenon. The cause of pacifism infused Relgis' work as a writer: a contemporary, the literary critic Pompiliu PƒÉlt√¢nea, believed that, with his contribution to Romanian literature, Relgis was part of a diverse anti-war \\"ideological\\" group of writers (alongside Felix Aderca, Ioan Alexandru BrƒÉtescu-Voine»ôti, Barbu LƒÉzƒÉreanu and some others). Pompiliu PƒÉlt√¢nea, \\"Lettres roumaines\\", in Mercure de France, Nr. 576, June 1922, p.803 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library) According to CƒÉlinescu, Relgis' literary ideal became \\"the living book\\", the immediate and raw rendition of an individual's experience, with such \\"idols\\" as Rolland, Zweig, Henri Barbusse, Heinrich Mann and Ludwig Rubiner. An additional influence was, according to poet-critic Boris Marian, European Expressionism, in fashion at the start of Relgis' career. In addition to political essays and fiction, Relgis' prose includes contributions to travel literature, deemed \\"his most characteristic works\\" by William Rose. These writings include attempts by Relgis to illustrate in plastic terms the application of his ideology: Ion Clopo»õel noted that, in his volume about interwar Bulgaria, Relgis went beyond the facade of \\"savage\\" Bulgarian militarism to depict the humanist, vegetarian and \\"Tolstoyan\\" civil society of that age.Clopo»õel (1933), p.168 Bulgaria necunoscutƒÉ also worked as a manifesto of anti-intellectualism, chastising the \\"demagogue\\" academics and praising the simplicity of \\"collective life\\". In a similar way, Relgis' scattered memoirs, among them StrƒÉmo»ôul meu, \\"David Gugumanul\\" (\\"My Ancestor, 'Nitwit David' \\"), shed intimate light on his ideas about Judaism. Other such didactic texts detail Relgis' advice on the art of living. Glasuri √Æn surdinƒÉ is noted for depicting the disorientation of a young man who becomes deaf: Relgis' alter ego, Miron, finds that such a disability has turned his old friends into opportunistic exploiters, but his imaginative spirit and his (minutely chronicled) self-determination allow him to rebel and start over in life.Batson & Bergman, p.xi-xii, 206, 307‚Äì308 However, deaf studies experts Trenton W. Batson and Eugene Bergman write, Miron \\"is not really representative of the deaf majority\\", leading a life of isolation and, out of despair, seeking out a miracle cure for deafness.Batson & Bergman, p.xii Relgis' patron Eugen Lovinescu was especially critical of the work, judging its \\"self-analyzing\\" internal monologue as burdensome.Lovinescu, p.238 The Bildungsroman Petru Arbore is noted by Geo »òerban as a \\"rarity\\" in Romanian literature, \\"instructive despite its excessive rhetoricism.\\" Eugen Lovinescu notes its traditional theme of social \\"inadaptation\\", which, to him, echoes the right-wing didacticism of SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul writers.Lovinescu, p.237 Over the three volumes, the idealistic Arbore falls in love with women of various conditions, and, to the backdrop of World War I, tries to build a business as an army supplier. Relgis himself warned that the book should not be seen as his autobiography, but as the \\"spiritual mirror\\" of each reader. Lovinescu believed the work to be heavily influenced by Rolland's Jean-Christophe, lacking \\"inventiveness\\".Lovinescu, p.237-238 Called a \\"sweet volume of essays\\" by Clopo»õel, Prieteniile lui Miron chronicles love and desire in relation to age and sex. The work shows a young girl losing and then regaining her faith in true love, a daring young man, \\"who mistakes love for sport\\", being rejected by his female companions, and lastly a mature couple whose love has undergone the test of friendship. Clopo»õel praised the text for its \\"seriousness\\", \\"finesse\\" and \\"reflections enlightened by knowledge and responsibility\\", concluding: \\"[This is] a literature of moral health.\\" These characteristics were also discerned by critics in his various contributions to Latin American literature. Courtoisie found Diario de oto√±o, a book that is \\"miscellaneous, multithematic, [moving] between the poetic and the everyday\\", comparable to the Fermentario essays of Uruguay's Carlos Vaz Ferreira. According to critic William T. Starr, El hombre libre frente a la barbarie totalitaria and other such recollections reveal \\"more about Relgis than about Rolland\\".William T. Starr, \\"Romain Rolland\\", in Douglas W. Alden, Richard A. Brooks (eds.), A Critical Bibliography of French Literature: The Twentieth Century, Syracuse University Press, New York City, 1979, p.451-452, 463. =Poetry= During his time at Fronda, Eugen Relgis and his fellow writers published collective, experimental and unsigned poems, largely echoing the influence of Arghezi and Minulescu, but, according to Cernat, \\"aesthetically monstrous\\". This perspective is echoed by »òerban, who notes that Relgis' debut as a poet was largely without \\"convincing results\\". In Triumful nefiin»õei, the main stylistic reference was, according to Lovinescu, the Romanian Symbolist prose poet Dimitrie Anghel, imitated to the point of \\"pastiche\\".Lovinescu, p.100, 237 With time, Relgis developed a style deemed \\"the poetry of professions\\" by George CƒÉlinescu. According to CƒÉlinescu's classification, Relgis the poet is similar in this respect to fellow Symbolists Alexandru Tudor-Miu and Barbu Solacolu, but also to Simona Basarab, Leon Feraru, Cristian S√¢rbu and Stelian Constantin-Stelian. The same critic notes that Relgis \\"attempted, with some beautiful poetic suggestions, to establish a modern-era mythology with abstract gods [...] and other machinist monsters.\\"CƒÉlinescu, p.936 Lovinescu describes the poet in Relgis as one who \\"survived\\" through humanitarian propaganda, returning \\"in a compact Verhaeren form, rhetorical and accumulative.\\"Lovinescu, p.100 Lovinescu includes the resulting works in a category of \\"descriptive\\" and \\"social\\" poems, relating Relgis to Feraru, Alice CƒÉlugƒÉru, Aron Cotru»ô, Vasile Demetrius, Camil Petrescu and I. Valerian.Lovinescu, p.98-104 Relgis' poems, CƒÉlinescu notes, were individual portraits of industrial machinery (\\"The Elevator\\", \\"The Cement Mixer\\") or workers (\\"The Builder\\", \\"The Day Laborer\\"), as temples and deities; by \\"natural association\\", the critic suggests, Relgis applied the same technique in his lyrical homages to the very large animals (\\"The Giraffe\\", \\"The Elephant\\"), but \\"this requires greater means of suggestion\\".CƒÉlinescu, p.936-937 In one piece quoted by George CƒÉlinescu, Relgis showed a bricklayer contemplating the modern city from the top of a scaffolding structure: Legacy The political ideas of Eugen Relgis were largely incompatible with the totalitarianism prevalent in Romania between World War II and the Romanian Revolution of 1989: as Rose notes, the scholar was persecuted by \\"four dictatorial regimes in his native country\\". Before this, »òerban writes, Relgis' intellectual contacts may have stimulated public debate, even though the writer himself could not claim the status of \\"opinion maker\\". Likewise, Boris Marian describes Relgis as \\"almost forgotten\\" by Romanians after his self-exile. In addition to Iosif Gutman, Relgis' Jewish Romanian disciples included FƒÉlticeni journalist Iacob Bacalu, founder of a Relgis Circle. FƒÉlticenii prin timp »ôi peste timp , at the Romanian Jewish Community site ; retrieved March 10, 2011 According to journalist Victor FrunzƒÉ, Relgis' targeting by communist censorship had a paradoxical antisemitic undertone, as one of the repressive measures which touched Jewish culture in general. Attempts to recover Relgis' work were made during the latter half of Romanian communist rule and after the 1989, several of them from within the Romanian Jewish community. In April 1982, the Jewish cultural journal Revista Cultului Mozaic published Leon Volovici's note about Relgis and Judaism. Late in the 1980s, Volovici also contacted Relgis' surviving sisters, then Relgis himself, becoming curator of the manuscripts left behind by the philosopher upon his relocation to South America. These were later donated to the Philippide Institute of the Romanian Academy, where they are kept as the Eugen Relgis library fund. Relgis enjoys a more enduring reputation abroad. Initially, his anarchist eugenics enjoyed some popularity among Spanish anarchists;Turda, p.94 his pacifism also inspired Lloren√ß Vidal Vidal, the Balearic poet and educator. Lloren√ß Vidal Vidal, \\"Mirador cultural. Un mensaje po√©tico de Jos√© R√≠os\\" , in Paris-Baleares, Nr. 329, May‚ÄìJune 1990, p.15 (digitized by the University of the Balearic Islands Biblioteca Digital de las Illes Baleares) Some of his tracts have been reissued after 2001, with the Anselmo Lorenzo Foundation (Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo). Italian-language versions of his novels, poems and political tracts, including Cosmomet√°polis, were published by Gaspare Mancuso and his Libero Accordo group, over the 1960s and '70s. By then, Relgis' works had been translated into fourteen languages, although they still remained largely unknown in the United States; Principiile umanitariste alone had been translated into some 18 languages before 1982. The popularization of Relgis' ideas in America was first taken up by reviews such as The Humanist and Books Abroad, while Oriole Press reprinted Muted Voices.Rose, p.12. See also Batson & Bergman, p.344 A second revised edition of Profetas y poetas, prefaced by the Spanish intellectual Rafael Cansinos- Ass√©ns, saw print in Montevideo (1981). At around the same time, in Mexico, his poems were being reprinted in Alfonso Cam√≠n's Norte literary review. \\"El lince\\", \\"Vana beatitud\\", in Norte, Nr. 285, p.26-27; \\"En un lugar de los Andes\\", in Norte, Nr. 286, p.34-35; \\"Ser rey\\", in Norte, Nr. 289, p.28; \\"Mundo viejo\\", in Norte, Nr. 305, p.34; \\"Ha muerto el gran humanista Eugene Relgis\\", \\"El lince\\", in Norte, Nr. 337, p.38-39; \\"En un lugar de los Andes II\\", in Norte, Nr. 344, p.18-19 (digitized by the Frente de Afirmaci√≥n Hispanista) In addition to the Philippide Institute collection, part of Relgis' personal archive is being preserved in Jerusalem, at the National Library of Israel. His other notebooks and letters are kept in the Netherlands, at the International Institute of Social History. Relgis' likeness is preserved in drawings by Marcel Janco, LazƒÉr Zin,Dorian & »òerban, p.III Louis Moreau and Carmelo de Arzadun. Notes References *Trenton W.

She was the wife of Arkadi Kremer. Biography Pati Kremer was born Matla Srednicki on 2 January 1867 in Vilna. She was the daughter of a wealthy merchant. In the 1880s she moved to St. Petersburg to study dentistry and there became involved with revolutionary political circles. She was also active in educational and literacy projects for workers. In 1889 she was arrested for the first time. Upon her release, she returned to Vilna, where she became a leading member and organizer of the Jewish Social-Democratic circle known as the 'Vilna Group', together with John Mill (1870‚Äì1952) and Arkadi Kremer (1865‚Äì1935). Pati and Arkadi were subsequently married. The Vilna Group was one of the precursors of the Bund and of the Russian Social- Democratic Workers' Party (RSDRP). Pati Kremer was arrested again in September 1897 and banished to Mogilev. There she resumed her activities on behalf of the Bund, working with other political exiles and local workers. In 1898 she secretly attended the second congress of the Bund in Kovno. In 1902, she and Arkadi (who had been arrested in 1898) escaped abroad, making their way to Britain, the USA, Switzerland and France. They mostly remained in France until 1921, becoming French citizens and working with the French Socialist Party as well as the Bund. In 1921, the Kremers returned to Vilna, where Arkadi became chairman of the local branch of the Bund. Pati Kremer worked as editor and translator in the publishing house of Boris Kletskin (1875‚Äì1937), a Bundist. In 1935, her husband died, and she began work on a commemorative volume eventually published in New York in 1942. During the German occupation of Vilna in the Second World War she became a leading figure in the city's Jewish ghetto, organizing and maintaining secret Yiddish libraries and clandestine meetings of the Bund. When the Ghetto was razed by the Germans in September 1943, Pati Kremer as among the many victims who were rounded up, transported to the Sobibor extermination camp and killed.

There are also links between Polish and Mongolian philology and literary studies. Their first manifestations were reports about Mongols in the Polish chronicles and in the relations of medieval Polish travelers to Asia. Knowledge about Mongolia in Poland became more vivid in the 19th century, when many Polish adventurers, prisoners in Siberia (see sybirak), learned people and businessmen of the part of Poland under Russian rule engaged heavily in Siberian, Mongolian, and Chinese affairs. Interest in Polish matters in Mongolia is smaller and dates mainly to the 20th century. There are also literary works (mainly adventure novels) about Mongolia in the Polish literature and a few translations of Polish literature into Mongolian, or Mongolian literature into Polish.  Early works  The Mongols at Legnica. A medieval manuscript about the legend of Jadwiga, 1451. Wroc≈Çaw University Library There are numerous mentions of the Mongols in the writings of virtually all Polish chroniclers, notably Jan D≈Çugosz. From the 15th to the 18th centuries, Mongolian affairs were connected or identified in Poland directly with the severe devastation wrought on the country by the Mongol invasions from late 1240 to 1241, then again in 1259‚Äì1260 and in 1287‚Äì1288. Mongol tumen under Orda Khan devastated most of central Poland, besieged and sacked Lublin, Sandomierz, Wolb√≥rz, ≈Åƒôczyca, then turned south towards Sieradz and Wroc≈Çaw. All the while, the armies of Baidar and Kadan ravaged the southern part of Poland including Chmielnik, the royal city of Krak√≥w, Bytom, Opole, Legnica and others. Panic spread through the Polish lands. In 1259, mere 18 years after the first attack, two tumens of 40,000 men from the Golden Horde under the leadership of Berke, attacked Poland again. Most towns in Galicia and Volhyinia were burned to the ground. The Rus soldiers under Daniel's son, Lev, and brother, Vasily, joined the Mongol expedition. Here's where the Mongolian affairs became connected and identified in Poland with the Tatar issues. More death and destruction was unleashed on the cities of Lublin, Sieradz, Sandomierz, Zawichost, Krak√≥w and Bytom. The Golden Horde remained very important in the literary tradition of Poland dating back to the Middle Ages. It inspired such works as a treatise on the origin of the Tatars by Miko≈Çaj Rozembarski (1499). Until the 19th century Polish‚ÄìMongolian relations were sporadic. Some of the earliest European mentions about the life, history and culture of the Mongols come from the travel reports from the journey to the Great Khan in the years 1245‚Äì47, written by Franciscan friars, members of the expedition prepared by the pope Innocent IV and headed by Giovanni da Pian del Carpine. One of the members of this expedition was Benedict of Poland. He wrote a short account of his journey, De Itinere Fratrum Minorum ad Tartaros. An author of the more extensive account of this journey, based on Benedict's oral narrative, Hystoria Tartarorum, was C. de Bridia, probably also a Pole. Hystoria Tartarorum contains an important description of the Battle of Legnica, one of the most important events during the Mongol invasion of Poland.  19th century  The first nineteenth-century Polish traveler to Mongolia was Jan Potocki (1761‚Äì1815), who visited Mongolia during his journey to China and wrote a travel report in French (Polish translation Podr√≥≈ºe, 1959). The father of the Polish Mongolian philology was J√≥zef Kowalewski, who visited Mongolia several times (1829, 1831‚Äì33). Kowalewski was a former filomata, a friend of Adam Mickiewicz, a professor of Mongolian philology at the University of Kazan, an author of several works devoted to very diverse aspects of Mongolian culture and language, often pioneering. His most important work is a Mongolian‚ÄìRussian‚ÄìFrench dictionary in three volumes (1844‚Äì49). Polish research on the geography and culture of Mongolia intensified after the January Uprising, when many Poles became political prisoners in neighboring Siberia ‚Äì one of the most famous among Poles participating in the research expeditions to Mongolia was Aleksander Czekanowski.  20th century  World- famous among turkologists and mongolists was a Polish scholar W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kotwicz, author of many works devoted to Mongolia and Mongolian literature, the discoverer (1912) of the old-Mongolian stone inscriptions in the Erdene Zuu Monastery. Other well-known Polish mongolists were Marian Lewicki, Stanis≈Çaw Ka≈Çu≈ºynski and Stanis≈Çaw Godzi≈Ñski. Lewicki prepared editions of many monuments of the classical Mongolian literature. In 20th-century Mongolia there was interest in Polish literature, strengthened by the fact that both communist Mongolia and communist Poland belonged to the same political bloc. Many translations of Polish literary works into Mongolian were published, although they were usually translated indirectly, through the Russian language. Especially a large number of Polish children's literature was translated into Mongolian. However, most of these texts were published in magazines and not as books. Some Mongolian citizens studied Polish philology at Polish universities. Some translators translated literary works directly from Polish into Mongolian. Among the most important were D. Biambaa (poems of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Broniewski and Konstanty Ildefons Ga≈Çczy≈Ñski), B. Bandi (Polish folk literature), P. Biambasan and D. Kim (novels by Ewa Szelburg-Zarembina). The most important translator was Byambyn Rinchen (1905‚Äì77): writer, historian, ethnographer and linguist, who translated into Mongolian many main literary works of many world literatures, including (directly from Polish) works of Adam Mickiewicz, Wanda Wasilewska, Jaros≈Çaw Iwaszkiewicz and Jerzy Andrzejewski. There are translations of his ethnographical books into Polish. The number of translations of contemporary Mongolian literature into Polish is not very big. As in the case of translations from Polish to Mongolian, many texts were translated through the Russian language. To the most important belong Opowiadania mongolskie [Mongolian Stories] by Tsendiin Damdins√ºren (1953), Wiersze [Poems] by Begzin Yavuuhulan (1962) and the novel Przejrzysty Tamir [The Crystal Clear Tamir River] by Chadraabalyn Lodoidamba (1980). Translations directly from Mongolian were published mainly in the orientalist journal PrzeglƒÖd Orientalistyczny, for example poetry and prose of Dashdorjiin Natsagdorj translated by Stanis≈Çaw Godzi≈Ñski and Adam Latusek. Godzi≈Ñski translated also a selection of Mongolian epic poetry and chronicles (W krƒôgu lamajskich legend i mit√≥w [Among lamaist legends and myths], 1981). To the most important translators of the classic Mongolian literature belongs Stanis≈Çaw Ka≈Çu≈ºynski. He prepared G≈Çosy z Jurty [Voices of the yurts] (1960) ‚Äì a selection of Mongolian riddles, parables, proverbs, etc.; Tajna historia Mongo≈Ç√≥w (1970), a translation of the anonymous thirteenth-century Mongolian chronicle The Secret History of the Mongols; Tradycje i legendy lud√≥w Mongolii [Traditions and legends of the peoples of Mongolia] (1978), which include excerpts from the seventeenth-century chronicle Erdeniin Tobchi and Mongolian folk epic poetry. Among Polish writers, whose works were affected by the culture of Mongolia, were Wac≈Çaw Sieroszewski ‚Äì especially his novel Dalaj Lama [The Dalai Lama] (1927) and its versions for children W niepodleg≈Çej Mongolii [In the independent Mongolia] (1937); Ferdynand Antoni Ossendowski ‚Äì especially his travel novel Przez kraj ludzi, zwierzƒÖt i bog√≥w [In the country of people, animals and gods] (1923); Kamil Gi≈ºycki (Przez Urianchaj i Mongoliƒô, 1929); Przec≈Çaw Smolik, an author of the story on the life of Buryats W≈õr√≥d wyznawc√≥w Burchan-Buddhy [Among the believers of Burchan-Buddha] (1925).

She is most famous for having captured the North American filibustering ship Virginius, which led to the \\"Virginius Affair\\", which afterwards led to the Spanish-American Crisis of 1873. Design and construction The ship was built as the Confederate raider CSS Texas, but was seized by the British government in 1863 and acquired in 1865.Jack Greene, Alessandro Massignani, p. 275 She was purchased by the Chilean government for ¬£75,000, through Isaac Campbell & Co, in February 1866.http://www.whenliverpoolwasdixie.co.uk/pamp.htm In early 1862, Lt. George T. Sinclair was sent to England, with orders to build a clipper propeller for cruising purposes, and to take command of her when she was ready for sea. His instructions were to confer with Commander Bulloch in Liverpool, as to the design of the vessel, and the building, fitting out and arming of her. Bulloch received orders to help Sinclair with funds and advice. He showed Sinclair the drawings and specifications for , also the contract with Lairds, and they both decided to use these as a basis for the new cruiser. What Sinclair did, was to arrange, with the help of the Confederate diplomat James M. Mason, for an issue of bonds, each equal to 25 bales of cotton, weight . Seven individuals took up these bonds, and were effectively the owners of this new vessel. The new cruiser was contracted by James and George Thomson of Glasgow, in October 1862. The same firm that was contracted to build an ironclad ram for Lt. North. Pampero was modeled on Alabama, even though she was somewhat larger.McKenna, p. 163. A plan showing body plan, upper deck, hold and platforms of CSS Alabama, sister ship of Tornado Pampero was to be in length, in breadth, powered by both sail and steam. Bark rigged, she was equipped for cruising under canvas or steam, with telescopic funnels, and a raise-able screw. Similar, but larger engines to Alabama were placed below the waterline for protection. Her frame was iron, with a mixture of iron and wood for the planking. Her armament was to be three pivot guns, and a broadside battery of four or more guns. The original contract called for Pampero to be ready for sea by July 1863, but the schedule could not be maintained. Guns and gun carriages were ordered, and Sinclair received ¬£10,000 ($40,000) from Bulloch, and perhaps more. For his crew, Sinclair made arrangements for some men to come out from Baltimore.McKenna, p. 164. By the spring of 1863, Sinclair was becoming very concerned about Pampero, and feared that the British government would not permit the departure of any vessel suspected to be Confederate. He visited Paris to discuss with John Slidell the possibility of transferring the vessel to France. Slidell suggested Hamburg in Germany would be a better alternative. However, Sinclair investigated this, but did not proceed with it. Meanwhile, the completion of Pampero was further delayed by labor troubles, and the seizure of Alexandria, another Confederate vessel in production at Lairds, by the British government. The Alexandria trial was indecisive, and Mason put off the launching of Pampero until a final verdict was reached. Pampero herself first came to the attention of Thomas H. Dudley, United States Consul in Liverpool, in the spring of 1863, when he made an investigative tour of Northern England and Scotland, looking for any warships being built for the Confederates. He learned that Thomsons were building a screw steamer \\"of about 1500 tons,\\" designed for great speed. He was told that she was to have an angle-iron frame and teak planking, and he found that among the workmen it was generally believed that she was for the South. On his next trip to Scotland in August 1863, his suspicions increased as new details on the vessel came to light. The builders insisted that the boat was for the Turkish government, but Dudley\`s informants in the yard insisted the boat was for the Confederates, being supervised by the same men as those who supervised the building of the ironclad ram. Dudley left behind a spy in Thomsons yard, who soon reported that the vessel was rigged in the same manner as Alabama, the drawings of which, he was told, were in Glasgow. Pampero, by a Mrs. Galbraith, the vessel finally slid down the slipway on 29 October 1863. On 10 November, the American consul in Glasgow, W. L. Underwood formally requested that Pampero be detained. Although the British government did not make any immediate legal moves, in late November a British warship was moored abreast of Pampero, and she was placed under a 24-hour scrutiny by customs officers. Court proceedings against Pampero commenced on 18 March 1864, and were never satisfactorily concluded. Capture Spanish frigate Gerona chasing the British-built Chilean steamer Tornado During the Chincha Islands War, the South American allies sent agents to European shipyards in search of unsold warships originally laid down for the Confederate states; Peru purchased two screw corvettes in France and Chile, purchased two in Britain, Tornado and the Website of the Chilean Navy Abtao, corbeta (1¬∫) , retrieved on 6 December 2011 She set sail from Leith with a British register, British flag, with a British crew, after having been duly examined by the Custom-house authorities, on 19 August 1866.Bentinck, p. 30.Bentinck p.9 Bound for a neutral destination, she had no Chilean men on board.Urrutia, p. 320. She should have been in rendezvous with the British filibustering ship steamer Greathem Hall, aiming to interfere against the Spanish trade. However, the latter was captured by HMS Caledonia and taken into Portland. Pampero (now named Tornado) waited patiently in the rendezvous point, until the crew were ordered to re-coal and head for the desolate islands of Fernando de Noronha, an old pirate haunt off the Brazilian coast, in order to collect unpaid wages and bonuses offered for the delivery of the vessel.Graham, p. 62. The Spanish frigate, brought strict orders from the Spanish government to capture these ships.Sondhaus, p. 98. However, the Peruvian vessels made it to Latin American waters but the Chilean Pampero was about to be captured. Gerona sailed from C√°diz in the early morning of the 20th instant, arriving at Madeira, Portugal on 22nd instant. At 6:15 in the evening; before arriving at the anchoring ground, she discovered a suspicious steamer weighing anchor and apparently getting ready to put to sea, for which reason the commander of Gerona, Don Benito Escalera, thought fit to proceed towards her to see if he could obtains news, and to be at the same time in readiness to follow in her track, should she turn out to be either of the vessels indicated to him by the Spanish government.House of Commons, p. 18. At 8:00pm, the frigate, thinking that she perceived that Tornado was putting herself in motion, and having been confirmed in that opinion by the showing of the signal agreed upon on board the Spanish schooner, commenced to move in pursuit. The course which Tornado took was in every way suspicious, for she kept as close into the north-west shore of this island as she could, coasting along it at a very short distance as far as Cape Trist√£o, where she put to sea steering towards the north. Notwithstanding that Tornado was some distance off at 10:30pm, and at a distance of more than from the coast, the captain of Gerona, a slower ship,Greene, p. 276. resolved to call her attention by discharging at her a cannon loaded with blank cartridge, but seeing that she kept on her course, he fired another shotted cannon at her, and this he repeated three times, Tornado then stopped. He sent on board of her tow boats manned and tow officers to examine her, which was done in due form, although it could not be affirmed positively whether she carried munitions of war or not on account of the great quantity of coal with which she was stowed. The commander made the captain come on board Gerona, and this latter answered the questions that were put to him with insolent and insulting words so that he was obliged to be called to order. He then ordered the said captain to return to Tornado, which was navigated to Cadiz by the 1st Lieutenant Don Manuel del Bustillo, 2nd Lieutenant, four midshipmen, one engineer, and 51 armed men, and the crew of Tornado comprising 55 men, among whom were five Portuguese taken on board at Funchal, were transferred to Gerona. Captain John MacPherson and the crew of Tornado were treated with great severity, both on their way to C√°diz and after their arrival in that city. The case led to negotiations between the British and Spanish governments expressed the opinion that the Spanish government had no right to treat the crew as prisoners of war, much less to chain them up.Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events, p. 688.

Designed by John Ericcson, built at New York in 1873 U.S steamer Virginius surrenders to the Spanish corvette Tornado. Oil on canvas 1873. She was brought into Spanish service as Tornado, and rated as screw corvette. During the Ten Years' War, she saw service in Cuban waters and had a notorious incident with the American filibustering steamer Virginius, that had been bought for the purpose of being used for landing military expeditions on Cuba in aid of the insurgents. Virginius had been engaged in this work for months, being even called by one of the Havana newspapers as the famous filibuster steamer Virginius.Rhodes, p. 93. On 31 October 1873, she was bound from Kingston, Jamaica to some point in Cuba, flying the US flag, and carrying a cargo of war material. Having a crew of 52 (chiefly Americans and Britons) and 103 passengers (mostly Cubans), Virginius was sighted by Tornado, and she immediately fled in a northerly direction toward Jamaica, but was chased by her, captured and taken into Santiago de Cuba. Fifty-three of the crew and passengers were condemned to death by court-martial, and between 4‚Äì8 November, were shot; among them were eight American citizens. Joseph Fry, captain of Virginius Relations between Spain and the United States became strained, and war seemed imminent, but on 8 December, the Spanish government agreed to surrender Virginius to the US on 16 December, to deliver the survivors of the crew and passengers to a US warship at Santiago, and to salute the US flag at Santiago on 25 December if it was not proved before that date that Virginius was not entitled to sail under American colors. Virginius foundered off Cape Hatteras as she was being towed to the United States by Ossipee. George Henry Williams, the Attorney General of the United States decided before 25 December that Virginius was the property of General Quesada and other Cubans, and had had no right to carry the American flag. Under an agreement of the 27 February 1875, the Spanish government paid to the United States an indemnity of $80,000 for the execution of the Americans, and another indemnity to the British government. Tornado was converted to a torpedo-training vessel in 1886. From 1898 until her destruction by the Nationalist aviation in 1938, she served as a hospice for poor children of sailors and fishermen killed or drowned in maritime accidents, in the port of Barcelona.Universitat de Barcelona.

Salinger sued and settled the case under the conditions that Kunes was \\"permanently enjoined from representing by any means that he is associated with Salinger\\", barred from \\"exhibiting, transmitting or exhibiting documents, writing or statements attributed to Salinger\\" and \\"required to collect and turn over any such documents or writings for destruction\\".

Kunes was arrested on March 17, 2011, for purportedly swindling his friend, former Caf√© Buenos Aires owner Wally Ronchietto, out of $2,000 for a nonexistent movie deal. On April 23, 2011, Noozhawk, a Santa Barbara online publication, announced that it had removed six of Kunes' articles from its digital archives as two contained plagiarized passages. On August 27, 2011, a Santa Barbara judge issued a $200,000 bench warrant for his arrest when he failed to appear in court. Thought to have been hiding in Bucks County, he was apprehended in New Jersey less than a month later. At court, Kunes pleaded guilty and admitted to forging checks. On May 4, 2012, he was sentenced to five years in jail for felony commercial burglary and grand theft by false pretenses. A plea deal allowed for a sentence of only four years if Kunes had paid restitution to his victims, but no payments were made. In February 2013, Kunes was re-arrested. He had been serving his five-year sentence and had been approved for electronic monitoring on August 1, 2012. Kunes removed the device on August 22, 2012, and mailed the device back to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office. A photo posted on the Sheriff's Office Facebook page led to his identification at a Carpinteria cafe and his subsequent arrest. He was released from prison in June 2015 but arrested again for violating the terms of his probation after falsely telling the Bucks County Courier Times that he was producing a Netflix series called Over My Dead Body.

Eighteen months later they moved to Cairo, Egypt, guided by her grandfather's job as an aviation engineer.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Appleby, the archdeaconry of Carlisle, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of St Lawrence, Appleby, St John the Baptist, Murton, St Peter, Great Asby, St Cuthbert, Dufton, and St Margaret and St James, Long Marton to form the Heart of Eden benefice. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. It stands on top of a circular mound overlooking the River Eden. History The mound on which the church stands was a sacred site before the coming of Christianity, and was used as a burial place by the Vikings. The date of the first Christian church on the site is unknown, but the nave of the present church dates from the late 11th century. A north aisle was added and the chancel was widened in about the middle of the 12th century. The west tower was built in the following century. In the early 16th century the chancel was further enlarged, making it wider than the nave. The Hilton chapel was built in 1723, replacing the former north aisle. The church was restored in 1885‚Äì86 by C. J. Ferguson at a cost of ¬£732 (). During the restoration the north arcade was rebuilt, tracery was installed in the windows of the Hilton Chapel, and a new south doorway and porch were added to the west of the original doorway. In 1893 the tower was re-roofed. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in sandstone rubble. The roofs are slated on the south side, and covered in stone flags on the north. Its plan consists of a nave with a porch to the south and the Hilton Chapel to the north, a chancel wider than the nave, a north vestry, and a west tower. The nave measures by , and the chancel by . The tower is about square. The basic architectural style is Norman. The tower is in three stages, with large angular buttresses. It is defensive in nature, with no external doorway, three tiers of narrow lancet windows on the west and south sides, and without windows on the north side. The height of the tower has been reduced, with a few corbels of the former parapet remaining. It is surmounted by a pitched roof. On the south side of the church is a gabled porch, to the east of which is the original doorway, now partly blocked and with an inserted window. The original doorway is tall and narrow, with a round-arched head, and a blank tympanum. To the right of this are a round-headed window and a 14th-century two-light mullioned window. In the south wall of the chancel are three windows, with a doorway below the central window. The east window has three lights. The windows in the Hilton Chapel are round-headed. =Interior= Inside the church is a tall, narrow, round-headed doorway leading into the tower, and an upper doorway, the latter being another defensive feature. Inside the tower is a basement and two internal floors. It contains two bells, but only one can be used. Between the nave and the chapel is a two-bay Norman arcade with round arches. In the chapel is a coat of arms dated 1723. In the north wall between the chapel and the chancel is a 14th-century hagioscope. The south wall of the chancel contains a combined aumbry and piscina in two recesses with semicircular heads. The font is Norman, and consists of a square bowl on a 19th-century base. Churchyard In 1823 the Ormside bowl was discovered in the churchyard. This is an Anglo-Saxon bowl dating from the 7th or 8th century, and now held in the Yorkshire Museum. A further discovery was made in 1898, this being the burial of a Viking warrior and his sword. The sword is held in the Tullie House Museum in Carlisle. In the churchyard is the socket for a cross dated 1643. A new cross was added in 1897 to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. The cross and the socket are listed at Grade II.

It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. History St Mary is the third church to have been built in the village of Itchen Stoke. The first was built before 1270 on a site near the River Itchen, but it suffered from damp, became dilapidated and was pulled down around 1830. Some traces of it remain. The second church which replaced it was built on land in the centre of the village which was donated for the purpose by Lord Ashburton, who held the advowson. Charles Ranken Conybeare, son of the geologist William Daniel Conybeare, became the incumbent in April 1857, but he took a dislike to the church, complaining that it was cold and damp, and that remedying these defects would be more expensive than demolishing and replacing it. Consent for the demolition was given by the Bishop of Winchester and the new Lord Ashburton, and the present church was erected on the same site in 1866. The architect of the new church was Charles Conybeare's younger brother Henry Conybeare, a civil engineer with an interest in Gothic architecture, who had designed the Afghan Church in Colaba, Mumbai, where he had also been responsible for improving the city's sanitation. Architecture Sir Nikolaus Pevsner described St Mary as \\"serious and impressive\\" and \\"quite a remarkable church for its date\\". It is approached by a steep path up from the main road and the design was clearly influenced by the Sainte Chapelle in Paris. =Exterior= St Mary seen from the east The church is of brown and grey rubble stone with limestone dressings. Above the west entrance door is a rose window, given by Lady Ashburton in memory of her husband. At the east end is a polygonal apse, whose gables have two-light bar tracery windows. There are four sets of three tall lancet windows in the side walls of the church. The steep roof is of purple and grey-green slates in a diamond-shaped pattern.

One Health is \\"the collaborative efforts of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and globally, to attain optimal health for people, animals and our environment\\", as defined by the One Health Initiative Task Force (OHITF).  History  The recognition that environmental factors can impact human health can be traced as far back as to the Greek physician Hippocrates (c. 460 BCE ‚Äì c. 370 BCE) in his text \\"On Airs, Waters, and Places\\". He promoted the concept that public health depended on a clean environment.The Internet Classics Archive. Hippocrates. \\"On Airs, Waters, and Places\\". 400 BCE. Translated by Francis Adams. http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/airwatpl.html. Accessed September 1, 2011. In the mid-1800s, Rudolf Virchow, a physician, recognized the link between animal and human medicine, came up with the term zoonosis to describe a disease that can be passed from animals to humans, and actively advocated for veterinary medical education. The founding of the Veterinary Public Health Division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1947 by James H. Steele, a veterinarian trained in public health, contributed to the understanding of how diseases are spread between animals and humans, or the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases. Calvin Schwabe, another veterinarian trained in public health, coined the term One Medicine in a veterinary medical textbook in 1964, which reflects the similarities between animal and human medicine and stresses the importance of collaboration between veterinarians and physicians to help solve global health problems. In 2004, The Wildlife Conservation Society held a conference at Rockefeller University in New York called One World, One Health, out of which the twelve Manhattan Principles were created. These principles highlighted links between humans, animals, and the environment, how these links are integral to understanding disease dynamics, and the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to prevention, education, investment, and policy development. Due to global scares surrounding the H5N1 influenza outbreaks of the early-mid 2000s, the American Veterinary Medical Association established a One Health Initiative Task Force in 2006, the American Medical Association passed a One Health resolution to promote partnering between veterinary and human medical organizations in 2007, and a One Health approach was recommended for responses to global disease outbreaks in 2007. Building on these initiatives, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and World Health Organization (WHO) came together with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations System Influenza Coordination, and the World Bank to develop a framework entitled \\"Contributing to One World, One Health-A Strategic Framework for Reducing Risks of Infectious Diseases at the Animal- Human-Ecosystems Interface‚Äù in 2008, reiterating recommendations for a One Health approach to global health. This framework was expanded and the aforementioned organizations moved into developing implementable policies surrounding One Health at the Stone Mountain Meeting, which was held in May 2010 in Georgia. The first international meetings with the topic of One Health were held in 2011 in both Africa and Australia. In 2012, Barbara Natterson- Horowitz, a physician, and Kathryn Bowers, a science journalist, published the book Zoobiquity, which highlights case studies of parallels between animal and human health. This book has spear-headed interdisciplinary research initiatives as well as a Zoobiquity conference series which have been held both in the United States and internationally. In 2016, The One Health Commission, One Health Platform, and One Health Initiative Team deemed International One Health Day to be November 3. Organizations can submit event details for One Health Day through the One Health Commission's website for global recognition. In 2019, Senator Tina Smith and Representative Kurt Schrader introduced the Advancing Emergency Preparedness Through One Health Act into the United States Senate and House of Representatives, respectively. This bi-partisan piece of legislation would require that the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Agriculture, and other federal agencies develop a coordinated plan to create a One Health Framework to help prepare responses to zoonotic disease and prevent disease outbreaks.  Leading organizations  The One Health Commission is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization with the mission to connect individuals and create relationships across human, animal, and environmental health sectors, as well as to educate the public about these issues with the intent to improve global health. In 2007, Roger K. Mahr from the American Veterinary Medical Association, Jay H. Glasser from the American Public Health Association, and Ronald M. Davis from the American Medical Association came together as liaisons with other health science professionals, academics, students, government workers, and industry scientists to create a task force and have teleconferences to discuss One Health.One Health Initiative Task Force Members 2007/2008 This One Health Initiative Task Force created a report in 2008 which outlined recommendations to create a joint steering committee, implement improved communications efforts, plan national One Health studies, develop a One Health Commission, create advisory teams, establish national meetings, and engage medical, veterinary, and public health students.Executive Summary of One Health Commission Task Force (2008) - The One Health Commission was officially chartered in Washington D.C. in 2009, with Roger Mahr as the founding CEO. A request for proposal for an institutional partner was put forth in 2010, and Iowa State University was selected to be the main site for operations. In 2013, Roger Mahr retired from the commission and the operations site moved to the Research Triangle of North Carolina, where it currently resides. The current executive director is Cheryl Stroud, a veterinarian, who has held the position since 2013. The One Health Initiative is an interdisciplinary movement to create collaborations between animal, human, and environmental health organizations including the American Veterinary Medical Association, American Medical Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Department of Agriculture, and the United States National Environmental Health Association, among others. The website was created by a pro bono team of Laura H. Kahn, Bruce Kaplan, Thomas P. Monath, Jack Woodall, and Lisa A. Conti to create an email distribution list as well as a repository for news and information pertaining to One Health. Currently, 1,252 individuals from 76 countries are on the email list, and 972 individuals are on their initiative supporter list. The One Health Platform is a scientific reference network which unites researchers and experts of One Health to better understand and prepare for zoonotic disease outbreaks from animals to humans and antimicrobial resistance, including a better understanding of environmental factors that impact disease dynamics. The organization has nine objectives, which include disseminating research results at biennial meetings, identifying knowledge gaps in the field, engaging policy makers, establishing a Bio Threats Scanning Group to connect One Health and global health security, share data, serve as a reference network to the government, foster collaborations, and implement policies, and increase awareness during One Health Day. The management board is made up of Ab Osterhaus, John Mackenzie and Chris Vanlangendonck. The One Health Platform is responsible for organizing the World One Health Congress meeting each year. The World Health Organization (WHO) was created on April 7, 1948 and has since expanded to include 150 country offices and six regional offices in addition to its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The WHO is the main authority for global health within the United Nations. The WHO was a partner in the 2008 establishment of a strategic One Health framework for approaching global health problems. In September 2017, a feature page for One Health was included on the WHO website, defining One Health and highlighting important topic areas such as food safety, zoonotic disease, and antimicrobial resistance. The World Organization for Animal Health was created as the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) via an international agreement signed on January 25, 1924 out of a need to combat animal disease outbreaks. It officially became the World Organization for Animal Health in 2003, but retained its old acronym, and is headquartered in Paris, France. The OIE has 182 member countries as of 2018 and is managed by a World Assembly of Delegates which includes representatives of each member country. It was also a partner in establishing a strategic One Health framework in 2008. The OIE works to maintain transparency surrounding global animal disease, collect and distribute veterinary information, publish international trade standards for animals/ animal products, improve veterinary services globally, and to promote animal welfare and food safety. Along with the WHO, the OIE hosts workshops about how to implement One Health networks and practices to improve health services in member countries. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is an agency of the United Nations, founded in 1945, to address global food security needs. It is an organization that represents 194 member countries. In 2011, the FAO put forth a strategic action plan for One Health, which had the objective to strengthen food security by improving animal production systems and veterinary services and called for action in improving collaborations between animal, human, and environmental health sectors. The FAO works closely with the OIE and WHO, referred to all together as the Tripartite organizations, and published a new guide to approaching zoonotic disease with a One Health framework in 2019. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), located in Atlanta, Georgia, is an agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The CDC was founded in 1946 by Joseph Mountin to prevent the spread of malaria. The CDC created a One Health Office in 2009, becoming the first United States federal agency to have an office dedicated to this field. This office works alongside other animal, human, and environmental health organizations both within the United States and across the world in order to increase the awareness of One Health and develop tools to help strengthen One Health movements. The CDC One Health Office is involved with multiple initiatives, including working to implement a Zoonotic Disease Prioritization process, creating Global Health Security Agenda Action Packages, overseeing the Zoonoses Education Coalition, developing guidelines with the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, and helping educate youth involved with agriculture about influenza. Additionally, the CDC One Health Office hosts monthly webinars, entitled the Zoonoses and One Health Updates Calls, to educate audiences about One Health issues including food safety, antimicrobial resistance, and recent disease outbreaks. International efforts The One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization process is led by the CDC, holding workshops internationally to prioritize which zoonotic diseases are of the most concern and helping countries develop action plans to address those diseases. The process involves 3-6 neutral facilitators representing human, animal, and environmental health sectors, up to 12 voting members which represent human health/public health, agriculture/livestock, wildlife/fisheries, the environment and other relevant government sectors, and 10-15 advisors from international organizations such as the CDC, WHO, FAO or OIE, academic partners, NGOs or other government sectors not directly involved in zoonotic diseases. The CDC One Health Office trains facilitators and it takes months to prepare for a workshop to acquire resources, identify participants, review zoonotic diseases and confirm logistics. Completed workshops have been held in a variety of countries including Pakistan, Tanzania, Thailand, Uzbekistan, China, and the United States with more workshops upcoming. Diseases most commonly prioritized worldwide include rabies, brucellosis, influenza, Ebola virus, and Rift Valley fever.

It is the latest installment in the Shane Schofield series. Marketing On 24 December 2010, Reilly announced his fifth Scarecrow novel stating:http://www.matthewreilly.com/rb_10-12-24_1.html One month before the official release, Reilly's publisher released a video trailer for the book. Plot summary During a routine re-staffing of Dragon Island, an old Soviet weapons installation in the Arctic, a Russian Spetsnaz team comes under fire from an unknown enemy. Vasily Ivanov, a researcher assigned to Dragon, manages to send out a distress signal which is intercepted by an American listening station in Alaska before his plane is shot down. Dragon Island was once the cornerstone of Soviet weapons research, a place where cutting-edge weapons were designed by scientists with a blank cheque. It has been seized by an organisation calling themselves \\"The Army of Thieves\\", led by the enigmatic Lord of Anarchy. Self-proclaimed anarchists, the Army is made up of former enforcers of the Pinochet regime, Sudanese Janjaweed militants, Islamic fundamentalists and narco-terrorists. They are planning to unleash Dragon Island's centrepiece, known as the Tesla Weapon. Experiments with rocket fuel and samples of acids acquired from the atmosphere of Venus have created a compound that, when ignited, can set fire to the atmosphere. The Tesla Weapons was constructed on Dragon Island as prevailing air currents will disperse the acid-fuel mixture around the world. The Army of Thieves have taken control of the facility on Dragon Island and have activated the preliminary stages of the Tesla Weapon. Still reeling from the events of Scarecrow, United States Marine Corps Captain Shane Schofield has been reassigned to an equipment-testing project in the Arctic; this equipment includes BRT-E, or \\"Bertie\\", a multi- functional, independently intelligent robot. Although cleared for active duty, Schofield is seen as a liability by the Corps, and has spent most of his time teaching new recruits. His situation is somewhat complicated by an outstanding bounty on his head; although members of the Majestic-12 conspiracy are dead, the French government has offered to pay the bounty as retaliation for the events of Ice Station and Scarecrow. Schofield is one of just two units close to Dragon Island; the other is a Navy SEAL team stationed on the USS Miami, a Los Angeles-class submarine. Ira Barker, the leader of this unit, warns Schofield to stay away from Dragon Island or else risk being caught in the crossfire. The SEAL insertion is a disaster, with every member of the team being killed off by the Army. With no other choice, Schofield makes for Dragon Island. Schofield and his unit locate the remains of Ivanov's downed plane, and manage to rescue him while the Army attack. However, they are interrupted by the arrival of a French submarine; the French government has sent an assassin known as Renard after Schofield. Realising the threat posed by the Army, Schofield saves Renard and two members of the French commando team sent after him, Dubois and Huguenot, also known as \\"The Barbarian\\", or \\"Baba\\" and described as Mother's equal. Successfully infiltrating Dragon Island, Renard reveals herself to be Veronique Champion, cousin to Luc Champion, a French researcher killed in Ice Station. She agrees to help Schofield stop the Army, but pledges to kill him once the threat ends. They question Ivanov, who reveals that in order to fire the Tesla weapon, the Army needs to seed the atmosphere with the acid-rocket fuel mixture, before firing a battery of missiles armed with red uranium into the cloud. Schofield decides to target the red uranium and throw it into the Arctic Ocean. As Schofield and his team begin to fight their way through the installation, David Fairfax - his friend in the Defense Intelligence Agency - begins to research the Army and Dragon Island. He grows suspicious that an irregular army such as the Army of Thieves would be able to carry out a string of attacks against high-value targets to arm themselves, and his suspicions are confirmed when he finds a CIA operative named Marius Calderon was writing about Dragon Island before the Soviet Union actually built anything there. He confirms that the Lord of Anarchy is actually Calderon, the CIA's foremost expert on psychological operations and gifted with extraordinary foresight; Calderon predicted the rise of China as an economic superpower by 2010 as early as 1982. Fairfax realises that Calderon let the Soviet Union discover the plans to the Tesla Weapon, and that the acid-rocket fuel mix will be distributed by the jetstream over China, India and Europe; once ignited, these regions will be decimated, but the United States will be relatively unaffected and able to preserve its position as the world's only economic superpower. Calderon succeeds in firing a missile armed with red uranium into the gas cloud, igniting it, but it is revealed that Ira Barker survived the SEAL team's assault and was able to shut down the gas diffusion process long enough to create a safe buffer, thereby limiting the ignition. However, Calderon still has several missiles at his disposal, and the larger gas cloud is well within their range. Schofield destroys the red uranium primers one by one, but most of team is captured before he can destroy the last two. He and his team are tortured by Calderon - Mother and Baba have their heads locked in wooden boxes with hungry rats - before Schofield is electrocuted and his signature sunglasses claimed as a prize by Calderon. He is revived by Bertie and finds Mother and Baba survived by biting the heads off the rats locked in with them. They then give chase to Calderon before he can either launch the final missile, or detonate a warhead on board a cargo plane. Calderon escapes by ejecting a stolen mini-submersible from his plane, but Schofield ejects the last missile from the plane before it can ignite the gas cloud. The subsequent explosion disables Calderon's submarine; he is found two weeks later by a Norwegian fishing trawler, having suffocated at the bottom of the ocean. With the threat posed by the Army finally over, the Russian government authorises a missile strike on Dragon Island. Schofield races back to the facility and gathers his unit in a nuclear bunker hidden under a laboratory. The missile destroys Dragon Island and kills the remnants of the Army. Schofield and his team are found alive and well several days later, having survived the blast. They are commended by the President for their actions, and the French government lift the bounty on Schofield's head for rescuing Veronique's team. Having finally come to terms with the death of Elizabeth Gant, Schofield starts a relationship with Veronique Champion - however, upon returning to the Marine barracks, he finds his sunglasses in his room, implying that Marius Calderon is alive. Main characters ;Shane \\"Scarecrow\\" Schofield A brilliant Marine Captain who is considered broken from the bounty hunt in the book Scarecrow after his girlfriend, Elizabeth \\"Fox\\" Gant, was killed. He is still recovering and has a USA $2,000,000 bounty on him from the French Government. He is working up in the North Pole with a DARPA team testing out new inventions along with his trusted friend Mother and two other Marines. He is constantly tormented by Marius Calderon over the death of Gant and a side story is him trying to cope with the loss. ;Gena \\"Mother\\" Newman A friend of Schofield's who knows him better than most people as she has been with him since before the events in Ice Station. She tries to help Schofield get through Gant's death, which is also causing a strain in her marriage. Mother meets her perfect match and the two grow close. ;David Fairfax A geeky cryptanalyst working with the DIA who helps Schofield by obtaining information to help with the mission. Schofield and Fairfax are good friends who Schofield stays in contact with for most of the book. Fairfax saves a woman from being kidnapped by several members of the Army of Thieves and they work on trying to find out why the Army of Thieves is on Dragon Island. ;Veronique \\"Renard\\" Champion Champion, the cousin of Luc Champion who was killed during the events in Ice Station, is a French woman Schofield meets during a failed assassination attempt, is trying to avenge her cousin's, which she blames on Schofield. During the novel's events, Schofield and Champion grow close and by the end, it is possible they have started a relationship together. It is revealed that Renard is French for fox (Libby Gant, Schofield's girlfriend killed in Scarecrow, has the callsign \\"Fox\\"). ;Jean- Claude Francois Michel \\"Le Barbarian/Baba\\" Huguenot Mother's perfect match who is part of the French assassination attempt on Schofield due to the bounty on him. Mother and Baba share many similarities and they work closely together during the mission. Mother is offered the chance to be with Baba but in the end, she decides to stay with her husband. ;Marius Calderon A CIA agent who theorised that China will become more powerful than the U.S. almost three decades before it did. He is the leader of the Army of Thieves who uses Psychological warfare against Schofield, going as far as to taunt Schofield over the loss of Gant. Calderon even makes Schofield watch as he presumably kills Mother and Baba for no reason than for him to just see it happen. Schofield was informed that Calderon died, which is later found to be false when he leaves Schofield's anti-flash glasses that he took earlier and left them on his bed.

The company built upon several predecessor companies efforts to construct a canal used for hydraulic mill power. In 1918, the company merged with Niagara Falls Power Company, which later became Niagara Mohawk and in 2002 was acquired by National Grid plc. Early history =Porter, Barton and Company= In 1805, \\"Porter, Barton & Company,\\" which comprised Augustus Porter, Peter Porter, Benjamin Barton, and Joseph Anim, purchased the Niagara River and the American Falls from New York at a public auction. The purchase also included the water rights from above the upper rapids to below the Falls. The company portaged goods by land from Lake Erie to Lewiston on the Niagara River, then shipped them east on Lake Ontario. When the Erie Canal opened in 1825, it made the portage obsolete and plans to develop Niagara Falls suffered. Augustus proposed a hydraulic mill canal in 1847 and offered the right of way for the canal to any person ready to build it, but the Porter brothers died before interest in the project led to construction. Company history =Niagara Falls Hydraulic Company= In 1852, Caleb Smith Woodhull and his associates purchased the land and the water rights from the heirs of the Porter brothers with the intention to build a canal, and in 1853 formed the \\"Niagara Falls Hydraulic Company.\\" A grant was obtained from the owners of a strip of land 100 ft. wide extending from a point above the upper rapids to the high bank below the Falls. The company started with the construction of the canal in 1853 but stopped after sixteen months because construction costs of the canal significantly exceeded estimates and the company went bankrupt. =Niagara Falls Water Power Company= In 1856, Stephen N. Allen bought the company, which was renamed the \\"Niagara Falls Water Power Company.\\" The company completed the entrance and river portion of the canal by 1857, with the exception of a narrow extension at the south end of the basin which was completed in 1881. =Niagara Falls Canal Company= In 1860, Horace H. Day purchased the company and renamed it the \\"Niagara Falls Canal Company.\\" At an investment of $1.5 million, () the canal was finally completed in 1861, but could not be used because of the American Civil War. After completing the canal project, it was idle until 1875 when the canal's first customer, Charles B. Gaskill's \\"Cataract City Milling Company\\", was using the water of the canal to power the milling company's flour grist mill. =Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company= Schoellkopf Stations 3, 3-B and 3-CIn 1877, as the company had only attracted one client, it declared bankruptcy and was auctioned off. The company interests were bought for $71,000 () by Jacob F. Schoellkopf, who in 1878 formed the \\"Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company\\" to use the canal. Lower Steel Arch Bridge After the transfer of the property, Schoellkopf finished the excavating, but the canal remained idle for a few years. The work on the power plant began and the canal was enlarged in 1892. By 1896, power plant number two had been completed and was supplying power to different factories about Niagara Falls. Many additions and extensions were made to the original plant, and company began to work on a new plant, called plant number three, that when completed, was separate from the original plant around six or eight hundred feet to the north. The workings of the Hydraulic company were entirely below the first Upper Steel Arch Bridge. Plant number two, which was one 100 ft. by 176 ft. in dimensions, generated an average of 34,000 continuous horsepower. The entire fall of the water in the canal from the forebay to the tailrace is 210 ft. The power canal, which taps the river at a point above Port Day, and runs throughout the city to a point below the Upper Steel Arch Bridge, furnished a steady supply of water year round. Just below Port Day is the beginning of the rapids, with a fall of more than 50 ft. in three-quarters of a mile. By cutting across a bend in the river the canal comes out at the cliff below the bridge the entire distance being about 4,400 ft. Built before the era of industrial production of alternating current, the electrical plant generated direct-current electricity, and only provided it within a range of two miles from the plant. In 1898 the company built the Niagara Junction Railway to encourage industrial expansion in the area. Hydraulic Power Company of Niagara Falls In 1907, the New York Public Service Commission law was passed which regulated the rights of non-electrical corporations from engaging in the development of electric energy and distribution of it. Therefore, the hydraulic business of \\"Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company\\" became the \\"Hydraulic Power Company of Niagara Falls\\" and \\"Cliff Electrical Distributing Company\\" was formed to distribute the power. The \\"Hydraulic Power Company\\" owned the building itself, the land, the penstocks, the turbines, and the water wheels.Niagara Gorge Railroad in 1913 The company furnished power to many of the largest factories and industrial companies in Niagara Falls, New York. Among the company's larger contracts for power is that for the Niagara Gorge Railroad, the Aluminum Company of America, The National Electrolytic Company, and many other large manufacturing interests in Niagara Falls. As of 1908, officers of the company were George B. Mathews (president), William D. Olmsted (vice president) Arthur Schoellkopf (secretary and treasurer), Paul A. Schoellkopf (assistant secretary and treasurer), John L. Harper (chief engineer). The board of directors was composed of George B. Mathews, William D. Olmstead, Arthur Schoellkopf, Jacob F. Schoellkopf Jr., and J. L. Romer. Cliff Electrical Distributing Company The \\"Cliff Electrical Distributing Company,\\" was an electrical corporation organized for the sole purpose of enabling the \\"Hydraulic Power Company\\" lawfully to distribute electric power. As of 1914, the main consumers of power from the \\"Hydraulic Power Company\\" were: *Aluminum Company of America ‚Äì about 70,000 horsepower *Cliff Electrical Distributing Company ‚Äì about 30,000‚Äì40,000 horsepower Both the Aluminum Company of America and \\"Cliff Electrical Distributing Company\\" owned their electrical generators and electrical apparatus and the transmission machinery (the transmission lines which carry the power from the generators to the place where they use it) and the \\"Hydraulic Power Company\\" owned everything else. In 1914, the directors of \\"Cliff Electrical Distributing Company\\" were: Peter P. Pfohl, Paul A. Schoellkopf, John Olmstead, C. P. Hugo Schoellkopf, and Jacob F. Schoellkopf Jr. The officers were: Peter P. Pfohl, president; Paul A. Schoellkopf, secretary and treasurer; and C. P. Hugo Schoellkopf, vice president. Schoellkopf mills along the canal in 1900 Competitors =Niagara River Hydraulic Tunnel, Power, and Sewer Company= Schoellkopf's success in developing millsites led Charles B. Gaskill, of \\"Cataract City Milling Company\\", the canal's first customer in 1875, to believe that there would be a growing demand for power. Therefore, in 1886, Gaskill formed the \\"Niagara River Hydraulic Tunnel, Power, and Sewer Company\\" to meet the demand. His company hired engineer, Thomas Evershed, to create a plan to develop power. Evershed planned to use the mechanical power of waterwheels and turbines rather than generating electricity. He proposed twelve canals to direct water from the upper Niagara River to remove power production from the River bank. The canals would feed 238 waterwheel pits with water plunging into the pit, rotating the turbine, and redirected through a huge tunnel into the gorge below the Falls. It was determined that Evershed's plan was too expensive, so Edward Dean Adams and others decided to develop hydro-electric power. New plans called for a central generating station and a shortened version of Evershed's tunnel. =Niagara Falls Power Company= Edward Dean Adams Station Power Plant, Niagara River & Buffalo AvenueIn 1889, developers organized the \\"Niagara Falls Power Company\\" and the \\"Cataract Construction Company\\" (incorporated June 12, 1889) to carry out the new plan. Edward Dean Adams, as president of the \\"Cataract Construction Company,\\" directed plans to construct a central generating plant and to solve the problem of transmitting electricity over long distances. Adams and the \\"Cataract Construction Company\\" began constructing a central power station immediately, however, the problem of how to transmit electricity long distance was not yet solved. On December 20, 1892, the Evershed tunnel and the Edward Dean Adam's power house inlet canal are completed. Therefore, the \\"Cataract Construction Company\\" sponsored the \\"International Niagara Commission\\", which met in London in June 1890 and was headed by Lord Kelvin. The commissioners offered a $100,000 () prize for a solution to the problem. The commission received seventeen submissions from experts around the world only to reject them all. The schemes ranged from a system using pneumatic pressure to one requiring ropes, springs and pulleys. Some proposed transmitting direct current electricity, including one endorsed by Thomas Edison.Edward Dean Adams Power Plant On May 6, 1893, after the commission failed to award a winner, Lord Kelvin and the commission asked George Westinghouse to use alternating current to develop electricity at Niagara Falls. The construction lasted for several years and was funded by an interest composed of notable businessman including: J. P. Morgan, John Jacob Astor IV, Lord Rothschild, and W. K. Vanderbilt. The Edward Dean Adams Power Plant, designed by McKim, Mead, and White, first produced power on August 26, 1895, and in November 1896, power generated from Niagara Falls reached Buffalo. The first 1,000 horsepower of electricity transmitted to Buffalo was claimed by the street railway company, with the local power company putting in orders for 5,000 more. Similar to the \\"Hydraulic Power Company of Niagara Falls\\" arrangement with the \\"Cliff Electrical Distributing Company,\\" the \\"Niagara Falls Power Company\\" sold power to the International Railway Company which obtained the right to install its rotary converters in the Niagara Power Company's generating station, but paid nothing additional (i.e. rent) for the installation. Consolidation In 1918, the \\"Cliff Electrical Distributing Company,\\" the \\"Hydraulic Power Company of Niagara Falls,\\" and the \\"Niagara Falls Power Company\\" merged due to government pressure for more efficient use of the Niagara River's water provided by the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1910. The consolidated company retained the name \\"Niagara Falls Power Company\\" and issued $26,000,000 () capital stock, common and preferred. The $26 million in capital stock was consisted of *$11,515,400 ‚Äì 7% cumulative preferred capital stock *$14,484,600 ‚Äì common capital stock The $11,515,400 in preferred stock was distributed to the shareholders of \\"Niagara Falls Power Company.\\" Of the $14,484,600 in common capital stock: *$540,000.00 ‚Äì distributed to the shareholders of \\"Cliff Electrical Distributing Company\\" *$984,566.70 ‚Äì distributed to the shareholders of \\"Niagara Falls Power Company\\" *$12,960,000 ‚Äì distributed to the shareholders of \\"Hydraulic Power Company of Niagara Falls\\" On March 2, 1921, the combined \\"Niagara Falls Power Company,\\" secured a federal license from the Federal Power Commission, issued under the Federal Water Power Act of 1920 for a term of 50 years, that authorized the diversion of water for power purposes from the Niagara River, above Niagara Falls, and the return of it below the Falls, all in New York. The \\"Niagara Falls Power Company\\" later became \\"Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.\\" which was acquired by National Grid plc in 2002 for $3 billion ().

During the Vietnam Era, the U.S. Army Chief of Military History asked Marian McNaughton, then Curator for the Army Art Collection, to develop a plan for a Vietnam soldier art program. The result was the creation in 1966 of the U. S. Army Vietnam Combat Art Program under the direction of the Office of Chief of Military History and McNaughton's office. Her plan included involving the U.S. Army Arts and Crafts Program, then headed by Eugenia Nowlin.

Army Soldier Artists in Vietnam,\\" James Pollock,\\"War, Literature & the Arts\\", An International Journal of the Humanities, (Volume 21, 2009, Published by the Department of English and Fine Arts, United States Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado), pp. 247-272. (in public domain) essay: artwork: NURSING by Robert C. Knight, CAT I, 1966, Courtesy of the National Museum of the U.S. Army James Pollock, who in 1967 served as a soldier artist on U. S. Army Vietnam Combat Artist Team IV (CAT IV), chronicled his experience in an essay entitled \\"US Army Soldier-Artists in Vietnam\\" for \\"War, Literature & the Arts: An International Journal of the Humanities\\" published by the department of English and Fine Arts, United States Air Force Academy. In the essay Pollock wrote: \\"The idea of rotating teams of young soldier-artists from a variety of backgrounds and experiences through Vietnam was innovative. Soldier-artists were encouraged to freely express and interpret their individual experience in their own distinct styles. The artists responded enthusiastically to their artistic , and the resulting products were wide-ranging and comprehensive. Styles and media used were as diverse as the artists themselves, some chose detailed literal images while others preferred expressive almost abstract explosions striving to replicate the horrors of war\\". Army artists after Vietnam During the Vietnam War the army art program also used civilian artists. While the last team of soldier artists in Vietnam was Soldier Art Team 9 (CAT IX) the Army's interest in using artists to depict army activities continued. The 1991 book \\"Portrait of an Army\\", published by U. S. Army Center of Military History and edited by General Gordon R. Sullivan and Marylou Gjernes, states \\"Following the Vietnam War, the Army continued to use both soldier and civilian artists. They have covered such peacetime activities as summer training for Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) West Point cadets, Army National Guard annual training, and tank gunnery training in Europe. The Army Art Collection has also acquired depictions of the Army's operations in Panama and Operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM.\\" In 2003, former Vietnam soldier-artist James Pollock gave a presentation entitled \\"U. S. Army Vietnam Combat Art Program\\" about Vietnam Era soldier artists at Mary Pickford Theater, U. S. Library of Congress\\"Pictures Tell Story of U.S. Army Combat Art Program,\\" Sarah Rouse, (Library of Congress THE GAZETTE, a Weekly Newspaper for the Library Staff, Volume 14, No 30, 5 September 2003 , James Madison Memorial Building LM5, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) p. 11. at which he said: \\"On January 14, 1970, the members of Vietnam Combat Art Team IX (CAT IX), the last U.S. Army art team to set foot in Vietnam, disbanded. Like members of eight other Army soldier-artist teams before them, they left their sketchbooks and paintings of war-torn Vietnam behind and quietly returned to their respective military units scattered throughout the world or were re- assigned. Talent and chance had brought 46 young soldiers together for a common purpose: To be artists day in and day out for 120 days and to translate their personal Vietnam experiences as soldiers into art. All of the artists were exposed to the inherent dangers of being in a war zone. While visiting units in the fields of Vietnam, they encountered difficult conditions and some had to deal with life-threatening incidents. None were wounded or killed. The post-Vietnam Era destiny of these soldier artists varied as they went on to establish and nurture families and careers. Some continued successfully as artists, some became art teachers, some laid down their paint brushes and found careers outside the field of art. Some have died, and the whereabouts of others is unknown\\".\\"United States Army Vietnam Combat Art Program\\", James Pollock, (2003 Lecture), (Presentation given at U. S. Library of Congress, Mary Pickford Theater, Tuesday, 15 July 2003, Presentation Sponsor, Library of Congress Professional Association (LCPA) Veterans Forum, Washington, D.C.). CD of presentation in PDF format and can be found in U.S. Library of Congress Archives. Presentation was also videotaped and in LOC archives. Public showings From September 2010 to March 2011, the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, PA hosted an exhibit entitled \\"Art of the American Soldier\\" featuring more than 300 works from the army art collection, one of the first times that the Army Art from the Army Art Program has been put on display en masse. In June 2015, South Dakota Public Broadcasting interviewed combat artist James Pollock about his experiences in the Vietnam Combat Art Program. In September 2017, South Dakota Public Broadcasting produced a video about the Vietnam Combat Artists Program entitled \\"The Art of War\\" as part of their SD Vietnam Stories project produced to accompany the broadcast of Ken Burns' \\"The Vietnam War\\" series.

It was developed as an alternative to common gendered honorifics, such as Mr and Ms, in the late 1970s. It is often used by nonbinary people, as well as those who do not wish to reveal or be referred to by their gender. It is a gender-neutral title that is now widely accepted by the Government of the United Kingdom and many businesses in the United Kingdom. It is included in many major English dictionaries. Etymology The word was first proposed in the late 1970s. The \\"x\\" is intended to stand as a wildcard character, and does not necessarily imply a \\"mixed\\" gender. Usage In 2013 Brighton and Hove City Council in Sussex, England, voted to allow the use of Mx on council forms, and in 2014 the Royal Bank of Scotland included the title as an option for customers. In 2015, recognition spread more broadly across UK institutions, including the Royal Mail, government agencies responsible for documents such as passports and driving licences, most major banks, several other companies, and UK charity Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. The title is now accepted by the Department for Work and Pensions, HM Revenue and Customs, the National Health Service and many councils, universities, insurance companies and utility retailers in the United Kingdom. The House of Commons of the United Kingdom confirmed in 2015 that it would accept the use of Mx by MPs. In 2017, HSBC banks announced the addition of Mx alongside several other gender-neutral titles as options for their customers. The 30 March announcement coincided with the International Transgender Day of Visibility, celebrated the following day. In 2015, Mx was included in the Oxford English Dictionary. In 2016, Metro Bank became the first bank to offer Mx on its forms (though other banks had amended records to Mx on request prior to this), and HSBC adopted the title in 2017. Although Mx remains uncommon in the United States, in April 2016 it was added to the Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary.

The film was released direct to VHS, and DVD on April 15, 2000, and centers upon a small group of paranormal investigators who spend a night in an old haunted mansion located in St. Francisville, Louisiana. The haunted mansion's back story was loosely based upon the true story of Delphine LaLaurie, a New Orleans socialite believed to have tortured and perhaps killed slaves in the early 1800s. Synopsis A group of paranormal investigators are given video cameras and the opportunity to spend the night in an abandoned house rumored to be haunted. The group finds several strange things, but initially their discoveries are easily explained away. However, as the night progresses they become more and more unsettled and wonder if there is truly a supernatural force in the house.

Author Troy Taylor helped put together the film's concept, which was initially supposed to be a documentary rather than a fictional film, a move that he stated was done mid- production. Taylor also stated that one of the houses wasn't abandoned and that a family was currently living in it. Upon its release the movie was promoted as a real encounter with the supernatural and the names of the film's actors were not disclosed. Reception Critical reception for The St. Francisville Experiment was extremely negative. A reviewer for JoBlo.com criticized the film, noting that \\"there are many scenes where it's impossible that the \\"actor\\" filmed himself from that angle\\", which made it \\"obvious that there's a cameraman there with his own equipment\\". Variety gave a mixed review, remarking that it \\"is ultimately undone by its inability to reconcile its two contradictory impulses ‚Äî to be the next \\"Blair Witch\\" while mocking the hand that feeds it.\\" Sabadino Parker for Pop Matters panned the film saying \\"Let's cut to the chase: The St. Francisville Experiment is bad\\" and ultimately advising \\"This is a warning: Stay away.

Part of a direct link from Cologne, only the section from Overath to Gummersbach-Dieringhausen is still in operation. The section of line from Siegburg to Overath and from Dieringhausen to Olpe are closed. The line is named after the River Agger, which it follows for a long way and crosses several times.  Significance  Although the line as always been considered by its operator as a branch line, it is central to the railway network of the Oberbergisches Land and it has been called a \\"secret\\" main line. Like the other lines in the region it primarily served local industry (mainly the textile and metal industries). Unlike, for example, the Wiehl Valley Railway (Wiehltalbahn),Wiehl Valley Railway the line was not primary built to serve the quarry industry, it also used to connect to company sidings and to other branch lines. Passenger played only a secondary role from the beginning. Despite the fears of critics, the line was initially very profitable: the line from Siegburg to Derschlag was the most profitable branch line between Cologne and Kassel. This section was opened in 1896 while its continuation to Bergneustadt was still being planned. Accounts from 1892/1893 show that it had revenues of 21,000 marks per kilometre. For comparison, the Wisser Valley Railway (Wissertalbahn) between Wissen and Morsbach generated only 6,800 marks per km. The following standard gauge branch lines branched from the Agger Valley Railway: *the Cologne‚ÄìOverath railway as a direct connection from the Oberbergisch district to Cologne *the Wiehl Valley Railway to Osberghausen *the Volme Valley Railway (Volmetalbahn) to Dieringhausen *the tramlines and freight sidings of the Gummersbach Light Railway (Gummersbacher Kleinbahnen) to Niedersessmar and Derschlag *the Finnentrop‚ÄìFreudenberg railway to Olpe. Up to the 1950s, there was also in Engelskirchen a loading bay of the metre-gauge Leppe Valley Railway (Leppetalbahn) to Marienheide and a very small narrow-gauge railway to Drolshagen. In addition, during the two world wars and the occupation of the Ruhr, the line together with the Wiehl Valley Railway was historically significant as a diversion route for coal trains and other important traffic. In the 1970s it was used as a scenic railway. Until the 1970s there were many sidings serving industrial companies such as Delta in Derschlag and D√∂rrenberg Edelstahl in R√ºnderoth. The traffic on the now closed Siegburg‚ÄìOverath section usually had only local significance. Following the opening of the Cologne‚ÄìOverath railway, trains ran from Cologne to Dieringhausen or even Hagen. The timetable only included a service over the whole of the original line from Siegburg to Olpe until the Second World War. There were also mostly only local passenger trains on the section between Dieringhausen and Olpe. There were few express trains in the timetable which ran to points outside the area. This was also one of the reasons for the closure of passenger services, partly caused by poor design, including the lack of a direct connection from Olpe to Gummersbach except via an awkward set of points in the Dieringhausen district.  History  = Planning and construction = Title page of the Festschrift for the opening ceremony of the Bergneustadt ‚Äì Olpe section The first documented written discussions on a railway through the Oberbergische district date back to 1861. At that time, manufacturers founded a committee that planned a railway connection between Cologne and Kassel. This was originally intended to be a main line. This project did not materialise because the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company (Bergisch-M√§rkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) preferred a more northerly lines via Hagen and because of the problem of financing it‚Äîa main line would have cost 30 million gold marks. For comparison, the section from Bergneustadt to Olpe was priced at 3,367,000 marks in its building permit. The planners of the Siegburg‚ÄìOlpe railway preferred a direct connection to Cologne from the beginning rather than the indirect route via Siegburg. But at this time, there was still a military base in Cologne, which was in the way of the line. Another early plan proposed a line through the Agger valley from Siegburg to the Ruhr as part of the East Rhine Railway. This plan was rejected after the intervention of Cologne industrialists. The Agger Valley Railway was the first major railway line inside the district of Oberbergischer Kreis. Before its construction, some critics claimed that its operations would not be profitable, so it was only agreed after long discussions and after the exertion of political pressure. The critics came mainly from the Cologne area because of its connection to Siegburg, as well as from the staff of the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company, which favoured a route to the north. The political pressure included the Prussian minister for railway at the time, Albert von Maybach, the most influential person in the region in relation to railway construction after Hermann von Budde. The first railway connections in the region occurred in Br√ºgge (in the municipality of L√ºdenscheid) in, 1874, in Olpe in 1875 and in Wipperf√ºrth in 1877. The connections there were too far from the Oberbergischer Kreis for passengers and profitable freight operations. For cost reasons, the railway was built as a branch line. In most places it was built right next to the road, straight through the villages. This would still be a problem at the beginning of the 20th century. Further evidence of cost savings are the stations of R√ºnderoth and Derschlag. Their entrance building were previously at Recklinghausen and Recklinghausen S√ºd. and Since they were no longer large enough, they were dismantled and re- erected on the Agger Valley Railway. In the case of the Derschlag station another source gives a different origin for the entrance building. An 1885 plan of the station indicates it was moved from Horst station (now in Gelsenkirchen) to Derschlag. = Completion to the end of the First World War = Public notice for the opening ceremony of the Bergneustadt‚ÄìOlpe section On 15 October 1884, the first train ran from Siegburg on the newly completed line to R√ºnderoth. It was initially frequented by only four pairs of trains. Protests led by local industrialists meant that the line was extended to Bergneustadt. The line came under direction of the railway division (Eisenbahndirektion) at Frankfurt in 1895 but almost all of it (from the 0.7 kilometer point) was transferred to the railway division at Elberfeld in 1897. In 1893, in the Volme Valley Railway was built branching from Dieringhausen to Gummersbach station at the same time the original Niedersessmar station was renamed Gummersbach, where it is actually located. In 1897, the Wiehl Valley Railway, which branched from Osberghausen towards Waldbr√∂l, was completed, which meant that Osberghausen station became a marshaling point. Finally a line closing the gap to Olpe was approved in 1898. A height difference to the watershed to the D√∂rspe valley had to be overcome. The Wegeringhausen tunnel was also built nearby. The construction was problematic and its cost rose to nearly twice the estimate. It was completed on 11 February 1903. This newly built section of track was especially important for the villages between Bergneustadt and Olpe. These were previously connected by poorly maintained roads and trails and the area and had not even been connected by telegraph. Therefore, the population enthusiastically celebrated its completion for several hours, despite the long connecting times to Siegburg and Cologne. At the completion of the extension to Olpe, five pairs of passenger trains ran between Siegburg and Olpe and four more between Siegburg and Bergneustadt. In 1910, the still operating section between Overath and Cologne was completed, ending through services between Siegburg and the Oberbergische district. This had a negative economic impact on Siegburg, because passengers now took the shorter, direct route to Cologne. The travel time from the Bergisches Land to Cologne was shortened to one and a half hours by the elimination of the detour via Siegburg and the old Siegburg‚ÄìOverath route lost its importance. Between 1910 and 1914, the line was relaid in many places on the hillside, as there had been many fatal traffic accidents and complaints of noise pollution in the area between Osberghausen and Derschlag. Between Niedersessmar and Derschlag the old track was used by passenger and freight trams operated at lower speed by the Gummersbach Light Railways (Gummersbacher Kleinbahnen). Between Vollmerhausen and Niedersessmar the old track was completely removed. In 1913, a line was proposed to Eckenhagen. This 6.9 km long line was approved in March 1914, but the outbreak of the First World War, prevented its construction. Similarly, it was proposed in the 1920s to extend the Gummersbach Light Railways to Eckenhagen. = Weimar Republic to the end of the Second World War = The high reparations required by the Versailles Treaty led to a shortage of rolling stock and a limited timetable. But the occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, when the French occupied the Ruhr region, meant that it became an important route for diverted coal trains. Thus the Agger Valley Railway towards Olpe along with the Wiehl Valley Railway and the Wisser Valley Railway (Wissertalbahn) and its connection to the Volme Valley Railway was one of the main lines in the new Weimar Republic for a few months. Due to the large amounts of heavy trains that ran on the line to the east, the cheaply built superstructure was damaged. The repairing of this damage took some time. In 1927, a direct service to Cologne was opened. In this case, however, the Volme Valley Railway connection to the north was preferred to running to Olpe. Express trains to the north in 1931 included a connection from Wuppertal over the Wipper Valley Railway (Wippertalbahn), the Volme Valley Railway and the Agger Valley Railway to Olpe. During the construction of Agger Valley Dam (Aggertalsperre) there was a high volume of commuters by immigrant workers to Derschlag, changing to the Gummersbach Light Railways to continue through D√ºmmlinghausen to Genkelm√ºndung. A specially decorated pair of trains was operated for the transport of these workers to Derschlag, running from Cologne to Derschlag on Mondays and returning on Saturdays. During World War II, mobile guns were installed on the line in H√ºtzemert because the east-west link again played an important role as a diversion route. From 1943, the Oberbergische district was repeatedly bombed by the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces. Because of the stationed guns, the station and the railway depot in Dieringhausen were hit by a total of fifteen massive air raids by the end of the war. Among other things, the western half of the large entrance building and the eastern half of the roundhouse and turntable were destroyed. Part of the roundhouse was never rebuilt. The diversion route stopped because of destruction to the west by German troops under Hitler‚Äôs scorched earth policy. Among other things, the Hoffnungsthal tunnel was destroyed by German troops. All trains had to operate via Siegburg. =After the Second World War = The reopening of the Hoffnungsthal tunnel on 14 May 1949 led to the abandonment of some rail services between Siegburg and Overath, there were now only local services. From 1949, all passenger services ran to Cologne. The Deutsche Bundesbahn railway division (Bundesbahndirektion) at Wuppertal informed locals from 1950 of the proposed closure of the western section, which took place after the thinning of services in 1954. Passenger services ended in 1956 due to roadworks. Between Siegburg and Overath the steam train service was affectionately known as the Luhmer Grietche. At the beginning of the 1950s, the era of steam trains ended on the line. The steam trains were replaced by Uerdinger railbuses. However, it was reported that railbuses were often overcrowded especially for the carriage of school children in Bergneustadt. In addition, changes were required from Olpe‚ÄìDieringhausen services to services to Cologne. The transfer times in Dieringhausen were getting longer and meant that many passengers preferred buses. Deutsche Bundesbahn itself increasingly operated its own buses (Bahnbus), competing with its own rail services. There was an upsurge in passenger during the construction of the Bigge Valley Railway and the subsequent excursion trains and other tourist trains operated. The line between Siegburg and Lohmar was closed in 1989 Hopes for a resumption of passenger service between Siegburg and Overath were dashed in 1959 with the issue of a license to close the line. In 1960, closure procedures commenced for the transport of freight between Lohmar and Overath, which were completed in 1962. The line between Lohmar and Overath was dismantled in the same year. The remaining part of the line between Siegburg and Lohmar was transferred to the jurisdiction of the railway division at Cologne. The last regular passenger service operated between Olpe and Dieringhausen on 28 December 1979 despite protests from the public and local politicians. Deutsche Bundesbahn closed freight operations between Bergneustadt and Wiedenest in 1985.

Retrieved 17 October 2013 due to poor construction near Wiedenest on 27 May 1989 and freight operations from Bergneustadt to Drolshagen were abandoned and the section was closed. In 1993, the penultimate special passenger excursion train derailed in Derschlag. The damaged track was blocked and was beyond repair. The last passenger excursion train ran on 27 August 1993. Freight traffic closed between Drolshagen and Eichen in 1991 and between Eichen and Olpe in 1993. On 13 May 1994, a class 290 diesel locomotive hauled the last freight wagon from Bergneustadt to Dieringhausen. Freight trains ran only between Dieringhausen and Niedersessmar until 1997, when the remaining track was closed.

List =Malaysia= *The National Heritage Act 2005 =United Kingdom= The National Heritage Acts comprise four Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that aimed to alter the way in which Britain's national heritage assets are managed and protected. National Heritage Act 1980 The National Heritage Act 1980 established the National Heritage Memorial Fund, abolished the National Land Fund, made provision for property to be accepted in satisfaction of taxation and provided for indemnities for objects on loan from museums and libraries. One of the primary drivers for the Act was the public controversy relating to the refusal of the Callaghan Government to accept an offer of Mentmore Towers and its contents in lieu of inheritance tax. National Heritage Act 1983 The 1983 Act established the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum, the Armouries and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew as non-departmental public bodies to be governed by boards of trustees. Section 30 of the Act made provision for the designation and funding of the Armed Forces Museums. Prior to 1982, other British ancient or historical monuments and buildings had been protected through the Department of the Environment. This was felt by the ruling Conservative government to be lacking in public respect and to be excessively expensive. The 1983 Act created the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission (HBMC), another non-departmental public body, to be given the a broad remit of managing the historic built environment of England. After the passing of the act, the HBMC was given the shorter working name of English Heritage, by which it was commonly known until 2015. After 2015, the body was divided into two parts, with the Commission being renamed Historic England. English Heritage remained as a charitable organisation, looking after the national heritage collection - including places like Audley End, Kenwood House, and many others. National Heritage Act 1997 The 1997 Act amended the 1980 Act by extending the scope of the National Heritage Memorial Fund to include > things of any kind which are of scenic, historic, archaeological, aesthetic, > architectural, engineering, artistic or scientific interest, including > animals and plants which are of zoological or botanical interest. It also modified the 1983 Act, inserting section 31A to make specific provision for preservation of the Royal Naval College site. National Heritage Act 2002 The 2002 Act extended the powers of the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission to encompass underwater archaeology within the territorial waters of the United Kingdom.

Power demand Pricha Karasuddhi, the technical adviser for the Nuclear Power Programme Development Office stated that power demand will double in the next 12 years. According to him, if the government goes for nuclear power, it must make a decision to do so now to pave the way for preparation. It is crucial to put this on the national agenda, again, according to him, to draw participation from all parties involved and debate the merits of Thai nuclear energy. According to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, daily demand for electricity hit 10 new peaks last year. The latest was registered on 10 May 2010 at 24,009 MW, higher than the record of 22,044 MW on 24 April 2009 - due to higher temperatures and economic recovery. EGAT is worried about power blackouts or brownouts in the next 10 years when demand rises against a limited increase in new supply.http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2011/03/21/business/Decision-needed- soon-on-nuclear-power-30151383.html Decision needed soon on nuclear power Nuclear power is expected to reduce Thailand's natural gas consumption in power generation from 70 percent to 40 percent. Figures from 2007 reveal that Thailand used natural gas to generate electricity more than any energy source at 66.2 percent, followed by lignite at 12.6 percent. Hydro power accounted for 5.5 percent, bunker oil 2.7 percent, diesel 0.03 percent and renewable energy 1.6 percent. Imported coal accounted for 8.4 percent, while purchased electricity from Laos and Malaysia was at three percent.http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/228677/thailand-power-choices- get-harder Thailand's power choices get harder Others suggest that power demand can adequately be supplied by cheaper and safer eco-energies. Fukushima 1 response Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, on 14 March 2011, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva ordered the Energy Ministry to review its plan to establish five nuclear power plants. The ministry has been instructed to study two issues in detail: * Emergency measures and nuclear plants * Potential as terrorist targets Concern is mounting given the problems in Japan, if Thailand is to adopt the Japanese model.http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2011/03/15/national/Thailand-reviews-N- power-30150908.html PM wants rethink of plan to build 5 nuclear plants as global doubts soar As of 2012, the Thai Energy Ministry is drafting a plan that could see a nuclear facility go into operation in 2026. Protests On 3 November 2009 anti-nuclear plant protesters in the Tha Chana District of Surat Thani Province dispersed, but demanded the electricity authority carry out a public hearing before proceeding with the construction plan. More than 500 protesters trespassed into a meeting room of the Tha Chana District office in Surat Thani Province while representatives from the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) were giving a presentation about a site survey for a nuclear power plant in the area.http://www.thailandoutlook.tv/tan/ViewData.aspx?DataID=1020521 On 15 March 2011 about 2,000 people from 18 districts of Kalasin Province rallied outside the city hall to protest against the EGAT plan to build a nuclear plant in their province. Banners were raised to denounce some MPs in the province for having asked EGAT to build a nuclear plant in the province and claiming that it was the wish of the people. MPs claimed the people agreed to having the nuclear plant at public hearings which in fact had never been held, they said. The protesters said groundwork for the construction of a nuclear plant had been underway near Non Somboon village in tambon Hua Hin of Kalasin's Huay Mek District. The construction site is less than 10 km from the Lam Pao River, the lifeline of Kalasin.http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/226826/kalasin-people-against- nuke-plant Kalasin people rally against nuke plant On 26 March 2011, a poll conducted by Assumption University reported that more than 80 percent of the respondents (83.4 percent) disagreed with the plan to construct nuclear power plants in Thailand.

Developed by Hewlett-Packard, it combines a general purpose driver (UNIDRV or PSCRIPT) and HP proprietary extensions. HP UPD simplifies driver deployment and management. This advanced print driver has the ability to discover HP printing devices and automatically configure itself to the device capabilities (e.g., duplex, color, finishing, etc.). HP Universal Print Driver is a Microsoft Windows solution that provides two modes of operation, traditional and dynamic. In traditional mode, the HP UPD behaves similarly to traditional print drivers. In dynamic mode, it provides discovery, auto configuration, and management features that are particularly well suited for mobile computer users. Operating modes HP‚Äôs Universal Print Driver is based on Microsoft‚Äôs universal core drivers UNIDRV and PSCRIPT. These core drivers are not usable until device specific information is used to inform the core driver of the actual device settings and capabilities. To accomplish this task, a universal printing dialog box is inserted before the standard print setup dialog box. The universal printing dialog box allows users to choose a recently used device, enter a device IP address, search for local print devices, or choose a device from a predefined list. Regardless of the device discovery method used, the Microsoft core driver is updated accordingly and the new device information is then reflected in the normal print driver user interface. HP provides three different Universal Print Drivers: PCL5, PCL6 and emulation PostScript. Custom default values can be assigned with the HP Driver Configuration Utility. HP UPD is available as a Microsoft Windows 32-bit or 64-bit driver and automatically configures itself to one of 35 currently supported languages based upon the language of the host system. Default device information for different drivers =Dynamic mode= In dynamic mode, searching for devices is accomplished using the mDNS discovery protocol (aka Bonjour). The mDNS protocol performs satisfactorily for devices residing on the same subnet only. Users will need to enter IP addresses for remote devices unless they have been previously discovered or are available on a managed printers list. Whether discovered, entered, or chosen, the HP universal printing dialog box submits SNMP requests to the target device‚Äôs IP address. Using enterprise auto configuration (EAC) and a bidirectional communications port, SNMP requests ascertain a device‚Äôs configurations and capabilities. The results are used by HP UPD to update the print driver table in the Windows registry to accurately reflect the target device‚Äôs capabilities. The results are also cached (CREG) and the recently discovered device list is updated to provide an easy method for future selection. In dynamic mode, HP UPD is considered to be a virtual device. Therefore, the new device instances do not appear in the Printers folder. HP UPD Dynamic Mode =Traditional mode= In traditional mode HP UPD is bound to a print queue and behaves like a normal printer driver with the addition of bi-directional communications for device queries and real time print job status. This mode can be chosen during driver installation, or on the dynamic mode universal printing dialog box. The traditional mode bypasses the universal printing dialog box and goes directly into the typical print setup dialog box. Automatic configuration does not occur in traditional mode; but, users can select manual updates to ensure the device‚Äôs capabilities are properly represented. The HP UPD can be installed either in dynamic mode, traditional mode, or both, depending on user requirements. HP UPD Traditional Mode Management features (INSTALL.EXE, MPA, AD, DDU, DCU) HP UPD includes driver management features allowing IT administrators to pre-configure, deploy, and manage the HP driver software. Management tools within the HP UPD include INSTALL.EXE with command line options, the HP MPA Tool, Active Directory Templates, Driver Configuration Utility, Driver Deployment Utility and HP Web Jetadmin. HP UPD Management Features INSTALL.EXE HP UPD installer allows some driver default settings to be modified via command line options. Some of these switches will change the system-wide behavior of the HP UPD, while other changes are specific to a single print queue. HP MPA Utility The HP MPA utility pre-configures some driver default settings in a managed HP UPD environment. Settings made within the HP MPA utility control the HP UPD at a user level. The resulting policies are maintained for every printer attached to the HP UPD. They are global user policies that affect HP UPD users. HP UPD Active Directory Templates An HP UPD Administrative Template(an Active Directory Template) can be added to create a Group Policy Object to manage the user UPD capabilities. The settings apply to any queue that uses the HP UPD. Care should be taken when locking configuration settings as the user is unable to change a locked setting. HP Driver Configuration Utility The HP Driver Configuration Utility (DCU) is a Windows application used to edit the configuration file associated with a particular driver. The configuration file controls the print driver settings and takes effect when the driver is installed. HP Driver Deployment Utility DDU is used to pre-configure a print driver for deployment. When the package is run on the client computer, the new configuration file configures the printer driver after it is installed, and does not interfere with WHQL certification. DDU contains the standalone DCU utility inside the package and is launched when Pre-configure driver is selected from the DDU tool. Beyond driver configuration, HP UPD also employs managed printer lists (MPLs) and managed print policies (MPP) to control access to devices and capabilities. These technologies are used with HP UPD in dynamic mode. If MPLs are used, then searching for devices is unnecessary. Users are presented with a predefined list of devices from which to choose. MPLs are XML files that can be created manually, with the HP MPA utility, or exported from HP Web Jetadmin. When the HP UPD is activated, it begins by searching the network for the MPL file as shown in Figure 6. MPPs are used to control which users have access to device features like color, duplex, etc. By default, HP UPD assumes that the HP MPA is installed on a server named managed-print. As a result, HP UPD searches the network for this server to find HP Managed Print Policies or HP Managed Printer Lists. HP UPD Managed Printer Lists and Print Policies =Status Notification Popups (SNPs)= The driver also includes status notification pop-ups during print submission that inform the user on device status, print job status, and consumable levels. This is a graphical popup window that displays a dashboard of toner supply levels, links for reordering consumables, and an instant support landing page for that particular HP device model. When the HP UPD is selected for printing, it will attempt to communicate directly with the printer to gather status and job information during printing. By querying the printer through SNMP get commands, network traffic is kept to a minimum and is only present during printing. If desired, the SNPs can be disabled.

In 1997 he left Keele and joined South Bank University as Professor of Financial Economics and remained there for 3 years. In 2000 he was appointed to his current post as Professor of Financial Economics at the :University of Leicester. Demetriades was appointed to a five-year term as governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus on 3 May 2012 . The post involves membership of the European Central Bank's Governing Council, the independent body responsible for monetary policy in the euro area. Demetriades, resigned from this post in April 2014, following tensions with the government of Nicos Anastasiades, which was elected to handle the country's bailout in March 2013. His early departure from office was viewed as a blow to central bank independence in Europe. Academic research Demetriades‚Äôs academic work focuses on the relationship between finance and growth as well as the interactions between public and private capital and productivity. His early work on finance and growth challenged the view that growth in the financial system is, by itself, sufficient to deliver more economic growth and emphasised the importance of good institutions. Moreover, he has shown that, where present, the contribution of the banking sector to growth is more significant than that of equity finance through the stock market. More recent work has challenged widely held views about government owned banks by showing that, far from acting as an obstacle to growth, such banks can actually enhance both financial and economic development. His work on public capital contradicts the ‚Äòcrowding out‚Äô argument often used by mainstream economists to justify cuts in public spending and reduce the size of government. Specifically, he shows that public investment can actually promote the productivity of the private sector and stimulate trade, employment and long run growth. In this sense, his work has a distinctly Keynesian flavour, influenced by new Keynesians such as Joseph Stiglitz. Although his work can be classified as macroeconomics, he also utilises both micro-data and micro- econometrics. His academic work has been influential, as evidenced by over 8000 citations in Google Scholar. According to the RePEc rankings, he is ranked among the top 2% of the world‚Äôs most widely read economists as well as the top 5% of economic authors worldwide based on criteria like average rank score, number of works number of distinct works, number of citations etc. Selected academic articles * \\"The Changing Face of Financial Development\\", with Peter L.

It was established in the 1950s with a number of other similar institutions in order to help regulate retail commerce in the city. This market has specialized in a variety of merchandise such as pottery, party items, and live animals -- and the two which make it notable, herbal medicine and items related to magic and the occult. Establishment Mercado de Sonora was one of a number of mercados p√∫blicos or public markets established by the city government in the 1950s, along with others such as Mercado Jamaica and the La Merced market. It is part of a number of mercados p√∫blicos or public markets established by the government to better organize and regulate retail commerce. It is derived from the pre-Hispanic tianguis or street market tradition, which still continues. It was originally set up with a large parking area for cars, but over time this space dwindled as the market grew. The official opening of the market was in 1957. For the market's 50th anniversary in 2007, there was a large party with actress Edith Gonz√°lez as special guest. The event also included mariachis and a limpia or cleansing to rid the establishment of any negative energy. The facility The market is located in the Colonia Merced Balbuena neighborhood of the Venustiano Carranza borough. This site is traditionally commercial, located near an old fire station. The area used to contain exclusively narrow, haphazard streets, but around the same time as the market, a number of main thoroughfares (called ejes) were built and now surround most of the complex. However, the areas behind the market still contain the old, narrow streets. The building consists of a single large nave mostly constructed of metal. Inside, there are a number of narrow aisles containing stalls owned or rented by individual merchants. Most merchants are grouped by the type of merchandise they sell, such as party supplies, dishes, and pets. What little parking lot is left is filled by street vendors. On Saturday, when the market is busiest, these vendors overflow from the parking lot onto the surrounding narrow streets. These and various trucks and other vehicles block traffic, effectively closing the streets. The scene is noisy, filled with shouts of vendors and music blaring from stands selling CDs. However, this is also the time to find the widest variety of merchandise, such as nopal cactus and fresh corn from Milpa Alta, flower pots and soil from Xochimilco, and medicinal herbs from Puebla, Morelos and the State of Mexico. However, the mass of street peddlers outside and the lack of maintenance of the building proper has deteriorated the condition of the market greatly. The peddlers nearly hide the market proper and promote a lack of security and cleanliness. The building also has not been well maintained since it was built. The lack of maintenance has led to leaky roofs, ramps and floors in very poor condition and problems with hygiene. Market representatives state that these problem are mostly due to corruption of borough authorities, who are also known to extort money from market merchants. There have been attempts to clear the street vendors from the parking areas of the market, with the last sweep occurring in 2002. Medicinal herbs and magical items Items related to Santa Muerte and others. What makes this market different and famous are the aisles dedicated to medicinal plants, magic and the occult, which are only two located in the back of the large nave. This part of the market attracts customers from most socioeconomic levels, as well as tourists. as it is promoted in various guide books. The two types of products, herbal medicines and magical/occult items, are not completely separate, as for centuries traditional Mexican herbal medicine has been strongly linked with religious and magic practices. The variety of medicinal plants sold is vast and include avocado leaves for inflammations, chiranthodendron for the heart, jacaranda flowers for the stomach and more. There is also dried rattlesnake, which is considered a medicine against cancer, dried skunk to ‚Äústrengthen the blood,‚Äù and starfish. Plant items more strongly associated with magic and religion include crosses of ocote wood for good luck, chains of garlic to ward off evil and a seed called \\"deer's eye\\" to protect against the ‚Äúevil eye.‚Äù The market sells occult items related to magic (white and black), pre-Hispanic religious and magical traditions, Santer√≠a, the cult of Santa Muerte, shamanism, and various others which demonstrate the syncretism of beliefs and practices that exist in the city. The market is one of the city's centers for practices related to Santer√≠a and the worship of Santa Muerte. It is estimated that 2,000 people each weekend come to the market specifically for this section of the market. Items for sale include amulets, horseshoes, candles in a wide variety of sizes, shapes and colors, with many of the colors have very specific functions, gold dust, black salt, powders of unknown ingredients, water of Saint Ignatius-to ward off unwanted attention, aromatic lotions and soaps, many of which are related to love spells and more. The most popular items are those related to love. There are candles, oils, amulets, soaps, needles, lotions, tobacco, herbs, and services such as spell casting and cleansings all geared to finding, keeping or recovering love. Products have names such as atrapahombres (trap men), ven a mi (come to me), miel de amor (honey of love) and Amansa guapos (tame handsome men). Most are related to ritual use of some kind, even as simple as burning a candle. Others are more complex with a mix of occult and standard religious practice. As late as the 1990s, before medical abortion was legalized in Mexico City, one herbal remedy sought in the market was one to promote the termination of a pregnancy. Those who sold it did not give the treatment, rather they instructed the client what to use and how. The client was responsible for preparing the mixtures and taking them in order to take on the medical and legal risks onto themselves. Medical risks were serious as the treatment always led to excessive hemorrhaging which would require medical attention. During the H1N1 flu scare in 2009, business fell at the market about 50%. However, for herbal medicine sellers, demand for a 10-herb blend designed to prevent and treat the flu kept a number of vendors solvent. The remedy includes eucalyptus, bougainvillea and tejocote fruit, selling for 80 pesos per kilo. During the same time period, merchants selling Santa Muerte paraphernalia reported selling a significant number of white dresses for the images, as the color is associated with health and purity. Cartoner√≠a, Day of the Dead, Judas and alebrijes Making an alebrije with paper mache Mercado de Sonora is one of the traditional markets for purchasing items related to Day of the Dead in Mexico City on 2 November. During this time, the aisles fill with items such as sugar skulls, papel picado (crepe paper cut into designs and hung like flags), representations of skeletons and more. There is Halloween influence as well, with items made to resemble witches, ghosts, Jack-o'-lanterns, etc. The market and the area around it are also known for the making of large and small paper sculptures called cartoner√≠a. This is a tradition that goes back hundreds of years, creating figures and other decoration for use in community festivals. The busiest times for cartoner√≠a artists is Day of the Dead, when the demand for decorations, especially skeletons is highest, and Holy Week, when there is demand for the depiction of evil called ‚ÄúJudas‚Äù which is burned in effigy. The Judas figures are inspired by the disciple that betrayed Jesus, but traditionally is depicted as a devil. However, other unliked figures can also substituted. These include political figures, especially those who have been involved in a recent corruption scandal. The best-known of the cartoner√≠a artists is the Linares family, which has been creating figures for five generations. For this family, like most others, it began as a seasonal occupation, but in the first half of the 20th century, Pedro Linares conceived of making fantastic monsters of cartoner√≠a which he called alebrijes. Over time, these creations became famous, culminating in international acclaim by the 1970s, and are in demand by collectors, galleries and museums. The craft inspired a similar one in Oaxaca, Linares‚Äô home state, made with local wood and generally much smaller, but still fantastic creatures painted in bright patterns and bold designs. In 1990, Linares received the distinguished National Award for Science and Art from the Mexican government. The Linares family continues to make alebrijes and more traditional figures in their workshops located just behind the Mercado de Sonora. Other merchandise The other aisles of the market are also dedicated to a number of specialties. Some areas are dedicated to pottery and dishes for everyday use, much of which is from the state of Guanajuato. These include plates, bowls, jars for atole, coffee cups, large platters and more. While traditional pottery still dominates, it is also interspersed with cheaper glass items as well. Another traditional area sells toys and party favors. Traditional wooden, cloth and clay toys can still be found, although they are slowly being replaced with cheaper plastic ones. These include dolls, tops, yo yos, cup-and-ball and many more. This area also carries party supplies such as hats, decorations and pi√±atas, mostly for children's events. The area also contains costumes for children, such as animals like rabbits and bears as well as princesses and ballerinas. There are also traditional ‚Äúindito‚Äù (little Indian) outfits mostly used in schools on Corpus Christi. There is also a section that sells live animals, from baby chicks, puppies, kittens, toucans, parrots, hamsters, full grown roosters and hens, ducks, rabbits and various species of snakes. Animals also include exotic species, including some in danger of extinction, which has cause the police to raid the market. Eggs which can be hatched are also for sale for a number of species, including peacock.

The BARREL project launched a series of high-altitude balloons during four science campaigns: January‚ÄìFebruary 2013 in Antarctica, December 2013‚ÄìFebruary 2014 in Antarctica, August 2015 in Sweden, and August 2016 in Sweden. Unlike the football-field-sized balloons typically launched at the Poles, these were each just in diameter. The last balloon was launched August 30, 2016. During the BARREL program, a total of 45 balloon payloads were built, and eight test flights and 55 science flights were carried out.https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/nasa-funded-scientific- ballooners-wrap-up-fourth-and-final-campaign Scientific Objectives BARREL helped study the Van Allen radiation belts and why they wax and wane over time. Each BARREL balloon carried instruments to measure particles ejected from the belts which make it down to Earth's atmosphere. By comparing such data to that of the Van Allen Probes, which orbit with the belts themselves, the two missions attempted to correlate observations in the radiation belts with the number of particles ejected. This was done to help distinguish between various theories as to what causes electron loss in the belts. Organization The principal investigator was Robyn Millan at Dartmouth College. Co-investigator institutions were the University of Washington, U. C. Berkeley, and U. C. Santa Cruz. BARREL was part of NASA's Living With a Star program.

Both the text (by an unknown librettist) and music are lost, but individual movements from this work could have been reused in latter works such as the Johannes-Passion. At one time, it was thought that the work set chapters 26 and 27 of the Gospel of Matthew to music, with interspersed chorales and arias, but current consensus is that it is possible that the text reflected a synopsis of two or more Gospel texts, as well as the interspersed chorales and arias. Background Of the five Passion settings Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach and Sebastian's former pupil Johann Friedrich Agricola mention in Bach's obituary only two have survived with any degree of certainty: the St John Passion and the St Matthew Passion. A third is documented in the form of a libretto dating from 1731 (published 1732) and a newly discovered libretto dating from 1744 (found in the National Library in St. Petersburg [Catalogue No. 17,139.1.423]).Schabalina, Tatjana. \\"Texte zur Music\\" in St. Petersburg - Weitere Funde\\". Bach-Jahrbuch, vol. 95 (2009). pp. 11-48. A fourth Passion is evident in the form of a manuscript copy by Bach and his son Carl Philipp Emanuel dating from c. 1730 (with an addition recently discovered in Bach's hand dating from c. 1745/1746) of an anonymous St Luke Passion that originally was attributed to Bach (BWV 246 [BC D 6]), but has now been attributed to a yet unknown master who was active in Thuringia in the early 18th century (possibly ending in ca. 1717). The attribution to Johann Melchior Molter has been rejected based on the fact that some of the material in the manuscript was done in Carl Philipp Emanuel's hand, who left Leipzig in 1734 for Frankfurt an der Oder). Much speculation has been made over the identity of the fifth Passion setting. Theories have ranged from a one-choir setting of the St Matthew Passion (\\"Eine Pa√üion nach dem Matth√§us, incomplet\\" was listed in the \\"Verzeichni√ü des musikalischen Nachlasses des verstorbenen Capellmeisters Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach\\" (1714-1788) published by Gortlieb Friedrich Schniebes in Hamburg in 1790).Schniebes, Gortlieb Friedrich.

Retrieved 13 May 2011 from http://www.cpebach.org/cpeb/resources.html Others have speculated that the Weimarer Passion was the fifth Passion setting discussed in the obituary. Others have speculated that this Passion setting not really an Oratorio Passion at all, but rather a Passion Oratorio setting of a text by Christian Friedrich Henrici entitled \\"Erbauliche Gedanken auf den Gruenen Donnerstag und Charfreitag ueber den Leidenden Jesum\\" (a part of his 1725 text cycle Sammlung erbaulicher Gedancken √ºber und auf die gew√∂hnlichen Sonn- und Festtage). Bach in 1717 The year 1717 proved to be a pivotal one in the life and career of Bach, then Court Organist and Concertmaster to the main Court of William Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Weimar. That year, he gained some notoriety outside of the region where he lived and worked, in the modern state of Thuringia. Johann Mattheson, a diplomat, musician, music theoretician, and Kantor (director of church musicI at the old St. Mary's Cathedral in Hamburg, published his treatise about music and musicians, Das Besch√ºtzte Orchestre, oder desselben Zweyte Er√∂ffnung: Worinn Nicht nur einem w√ºrcklichen galant- homme ... sondern auch manchem Musico selbst die alleraufrichtigste und deutlichste Vorstellung musicalischer Wissenschaften .... In Part I, Chapter V, p. 222 of this treatise, Mattheson states \\"Ich habe von dem ber√ºhmten Organisten zu Weimar/hrn. Joh. Sebastian Bach/Sachen gesehen...\\" (\\"I have of the organist to Weimar/Mr. Joh. Sebastian Bach/seen things ...\\").Mattheson, Johann. Das Besch√ºtzte Orchestre, oder desselben Zweyte Er√∂ffnung Worinn Nicht nur einem w√ºrcklichen galant-homme ... sondern auch manchem Musico selbst die alleraufrichtigste und deutlichste Vorstellung musicalischer Wissenschaften ... ertheilet .... Hamburg, Schiller-Verlag, 1717. p. 222. Retrieved 12 May 2011 from the M√ºnchener Digitale Bibliotek website In this work, he lists famous contemporary and former organists. Thus, for the first time, the name of Johann Sebastian Bach appeared in print. In the autumn of that year, Bach was invited to a Keyboard instrument contest in the capital city of the Electorate of Saxony, Dresden, between himself and the French Royal Court Organist and Keyboardist Louis Marchand,actually Louis-Claude Marchand who was then towards the end of a long concert tour of the Holy Roman Empire. When Bach arrived, however, he learned that his rival had left the night before, thus aborting the contest and by default acknowledging his inferiority to Bach's skills. Back at Weimar, his employment situation became more complicated. In 1716, his co-employer Ernest Augustus I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar- Eisenach had married Princess Eleonore Wilhelmine of Anhalt-K√∂then (an event that Bach probably participated in and for which he provided music). The new duchess's brother (Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then) may also have attended the event. If that is the case, he would have met Bach then. At any rate, on 5 August 1717, Leopold officially ordered Bach to become his Court Kapellmeister. Around the same time (1717), the relations between the co- rulers in Weimar became even more strained than they had been previously, to the point that Wilhelm Ernst officially forbade his employees to have any relations or communications with the Ernst August's residence Rotes Schloss. Wilhelm Ernst was also looking for a successor to the post of Kapellmeister at his court because the previous holder of the post, Johann Samuel Drese, had died on 1 December 1716. Eventually Drese's son (a less talented candidate) was selected for the post. Possibly because of this perceived snub, and also because of the perceived better circumstances awaiting him in K√∂then both financially and in prestige, Bach began more vehemently to request his release from Wilhelm Ernst. He had become so insistent that between 6 November and 2 December, he was imprisoned before final permission was granted. The court secretary's report of the incident relates as follows: At any rate, during this flurry of activity, Bach had also received a commission from Frederick II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg to compose and perform a Passion setting for his court for Good Friday, as his then Kapellmeister, Christian Friedrich Witt, was on his deathbed. Bach accepted the commission, and performed the work on 26 March 1717 at the Schloss Friedenstein Chapel. The work performed there was the so-called Weimarer Passion. The work The text and music of this Weimarer Passion are lost. In recent research, nine movements from this work have been identified because Bach reused them in different functions. These are as follows: # Chorale fantasia on \\"\\", D major, for SATB choir, flauto traverso I/II, oboe I/II, violino I/II, viola, continuo (incl. liuto and organo) # Aria with Chorale \\"\\", F-sharp minor, for bass solo, choral soprano, flauto traverso I/II, continuo # Aria , A major, for solo tenor, violino I/II, viola, continuo # Aria , C minor, for solo tenor, oboe I/II, bassono, continuo # Chorale fantasia on \\"\\" G minor (Coro: S A T B, Flauto traverso I/II, Oboe I/II, Violino I/II, Viola, Continuo # Chorale \\"\\", BWV 283 (BC F 31.1), A minor, SATB, flauto traverso I/II, oboe I/II, violino I/II, viola, continuo # Aria , D minor, for tenor, flauto traverso, continuo # Recitativo , B-flat major, for tenor, violino I/II, viola, continuo # Chorale \\"\\", B major, SATB, flauto traverso I/II, oboe I/II, violino I/II, viola, continuo On 7 February 1723, the fifth movement mentioned above was used again after the sermon as the fourth and final movement of the second trial piece Bach wrote for his application for the post of Cantor of St. Thomas Church, Leipzig and Directoris Chori musici of Leipzig, the cantata Du wahrer Gott und Davids Sohn, BWV 23. For this work (BC A 47b, Bach transposed it to F-sharp minor. The work was revived again (with the same setting and key) on 20 February 1724 (Quinquagesima or Estomihi Sunday), this time with brass instruments (Cornetto, Trombone I-III, all colla voce Cornet with Soprano, Trombone I with Alto, Trombone II with Tenor, and Trombone III with Bass (voice type)). In 1725, Bach revived (possibly a last-minute decision) his St John Passion. It is possible that he had in mind a revival of the Weimarer Passion, but realized that it was impossible, especially since the Leipzig liturgy required a Passion setting in two parts framing the sermon. However, this did not stop Bach from reusing material from the Weimar work in this new Passion setting. Of the nine movements mentioned in the above list, Bach would use five of them in the second version of the St John Passion: # Chorale fantasia \\"O Mensch, bewein dein S√ºnde gro√ü\\" E major (Coro: S A T B, Flauto traverso I/II, Oboe I/II, Violino I/II, Viola, Continuo), replacing the 1724 original Movement I (\\"Herr, unser Herrscher\\", G minor, Coro: S A T B, Oboe I/II, Violino I/II, Viola, Continuo). Movements 2-11 of 1724 work = Movements 2-11 of 1725 work. # Aria with Chorale \\"Himmel rei√üe, Welt erbebe\\" F minor (Solo: B, Coro: S, Flauto traverso I/II, Continuo)--New Movement 12. Movement 12 of 1724 work = Movement 13 of 1725 work. Movement 13 of 1724 work = replaced by movement below. # Aria \\"Zerschmettert mich, ihr Felsen und ihr H√ºgel\\" A major (Solo: T, Violino I/II, Viola, Continuo)--New Movement 14 (replacing Movement 13 of 1724 work). Movements 14-19 of 1724 work = Movements 15-20 of 1725 work (Movement 20 of 1724 work left out, Movement 19 of 1724 work replaced by new aria [see below]) # Aria \\"Ach windet euch nicht so, geplagte Seelen\\" C minor (Solo: T, Oboe I/II, Continuo)--New Movement 20 (replacing Movement 19 of 1724 work). Movements 21-40 of 1724 work = Movements 21- 40 of 1725 work, Movement 40 replaced by new Chorale (see below) # Chorale fantasia \\"Christe, du Lamm Gottes\\" G minor (Coro: S A T B, Flauto traverso I/II, Oboe I/II, Violino I/II, Viola, Continuo) On 17 November 1726, Bach composed his cantata for the 22nd Sunday after Trinity Sunday, Ich armer Mensch, ich S√ºndenknecht, BWV 55, for solo tenor, SATB, flauto traverso, oboe, violino I/II, viola, organo and continuo, in G minor. For the final three movements of the work, a sequence of aria, recitative and chorale, Bach employed movements 7 to 9 of the above-mentioned list of movements of the Weimarer Passion. The chorale setting BWV 283, number 6 of the list above, was later included in the collection of chorales that Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach and Johann Philipp Kirnberger compiled and Johann Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf published between 1784 and 1787 (BWV 253-438). Between 1728 and 1731, Bach again revived his Quinquagesima cantata Du wahrer Gott und Davids Sohn. This time he set it in C minor and removed the brass parts from the final movements and revised its vocal parts. Finally, on 29 March 1736, 23 March 1742, and between 1743-1746, Bach revived his St Matthew Passion in a new form. In this version, he replaced the original four-part chorale setting that ends Part I with the chorale fantasia that he used in both the Weimarer Passion and as movement 1 of the 1725 (second) version of the St John Passion. This time, he scored it in E major for 2 choirs, 2 orchestras, 2 organs (and ripieno soprano choir in the 1742 and 1743-6 versions). Vocal and instrumental forces The conjectured scoring for the work (based on the scoring of the aforementioned movements that had been reused in other forms) is: tenor and bass soloists, choir SATB, flauto traverso I/II, oboe I/II, violino I/II, viola, basso continuo.Retrieved 17 May 2011 from http://www.bach- digital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00001533. There is evidence (in the form of payment records) that the continuo also consisted of one or two lutes. This would therefore be a total of 20 instrumentalists, to which would be added an organist and harpsichordist. Bach would probably be the harpsichordist, as according to the surviving information we have about his conducting position, he often conducted from the harpsichord. However, it is possible that Bach could have led the ensemble from the violin, as with other performances from the Weimar period. For Passion music, there would be no trumpets and timpani. The vocal forces would require 12-16 singers (3-4 per part) Notes References External links * BWV 23b (libretto) at bachdiskographie website * BWV 23c (libretto) at bachdiskographie website * BWV 245, second version of 1725 (libretto) at bachdiskographie website Lost musical works by Johann Sebastian Bach Passions and oratorios by Johann Sebastian Bach ","title":"Weimarer Passion"},{"id":"31155614","text":"Cape Air Force Base also known as Fort Glenn Army Air Base, is a site significant for its role in World War II fighting, operating alongside Naval Air Facility Otter Point.

History =Origins= Because of the perceived vulnerability of Alaska immediately following the Pearl Harbor Attack, additional Army Air Corps units were authorized by General Henry H. Arnold for Alaska and plans were made to send modern aircraft to the Territory to replace the obsolete aircraft assigned. However, the Alaskan Air Force had few airfields to accommodate the additional aircraft and units being assigned.Chloe, John Hale, (1984), Top Cover for America. the Air Force in Alaska. 1920‚Äì1983, Pictorial Histories Publishing Company, Along with new airfields on the mainland and Southwest Alaska, new air bases were planned for the air defense of the Aleutians to Dutch Harbor. Construction of the new bases on Umnak and Cold Bay began in January 1942 in secret, with construction reportedly disguised as a cannery. Originally, the equipment was supposed to construct McGrath Army Airbase, but the ground had frozen by the time that the equipment arrived. The first United States Army engineers landed at what would become Fort Glenn Army Air Base on 17 January and construction began by the end of the month. A Naval airfield, Naval Air Facility Otter Point, was adjacent to the Army Airbase. The 807th Engineering Battalion (Aviation) was brought in from Yukat to perform the construction along with a detachment of the Navy Seabee 8th Construction Battalion. Cape Field, later Fort Glenn Army Air Base, was secretly built at Otter Point on Umnak Island in 1942. Personnel tents at Fort Glenn Army Air Base, May 1942 Plans called for three hard-surfaced runways (four were eventually built), but time was of the essence in the construction of the base, as the air defense of Dutch Harbor was dependent on them. Instead of a hard surface, engineers chose to use a new material, pierced steel planking (PSP), which could be laid down quickly over a compressed gravel subsurface to provide the airfield with an all-weather capability. 80,000 pieces of matting needed to be barged to the island. Construction crews worked in three shifts, 24 hours a day laying down the runways and constructing a rudimentary support station, water and sewer lines, an electrical grid, communications, fuel and munitions storage sites and all the other necessities to convert a remote island site into an operational airfield capable of supporting heavy bombers. A PSP runway was completed on 5 April although a C-53 was the first plane to land on the field, on 31 March. The main runway was officially opened on 23 May.AFHRA Document 00001959 Fort Glenn's first runway was then the U.S. Army's most westerly airfield in the Aleutian Islands.\\" The first operational unit, the 11th Fighter Squadron, moved into Fort Glenn with P-40 Warhawk fighters on 26 May from Elmendorf Field. Additional construction continued throughout 1942 with four √ó runways were completed (06/24, 07/35), two of which (03/21, 04/22) were situated only 10 degrees apart. All runways had four layers of asphalt laid down over the PSP. Two additional emergency landing fields were built, one on the north coast of the island (North Shore) , 9.4 miles north; the other 7.7 miles to the west- southwest of the base near the Tullk Volcano (Pacifier) .Fort Glenn Army Airfield / Naval Air Facility Otter Point, Umnak Island, Alaska Morrison- Knudsen Construction Company built hundreds of Quonset hut structures on the base, replacing the temporary tents which exposed the construction crews to the sudden storms which swept the island frequently. Housing and messing facilities for 119 officers and 359 men were constructed as well as recreational and service buildings. Storage facilities consisted of 6,975 square feet for general stores and a 150-cubic-foot freezer. Buildings for aircraft included a kodiak-type hangar, x , a squadron warehouse, and a terminal for air transport service. Administration offices were housed in five buildings with a total floor space of 3,850 square feet. Radio facilities included a transmitting station, a direction-finder station, and a radar station, all with separate power houses, and with housing and messing provisions for personnel. The hospital, located in one small building, contained eight beds. The maintenance force of the station was installed in seven buildings. Electric power was provided by three diesel-electric generators. =Aleutian Islands campaign= 11th Fighter Squadron P-40 Warhawks at Fort Glenn AAB, June 1942 On 3 June 1942 the Imperial Japanese Navy launched two aircraft carrier raids on the United States Army barracks and the US Navy base at Dutch Harbor on nearby Amaknak Island. The attack was a surprise, but the base been on alert for an attack for many days, although there was no specific warning of the attack before the Japanese planes arrived over Dutch Harbor. The attack signaled the beginning of the Aleutian Islands campaign. In response, the P-40s of the 11th Fighter Squadron from Fort Glenn AAB along with Naval land-based fighters attacked the Japanese aircraft. Eleventh Air Force also dispatched aircraft from Elmendorf Field. In the ensuring battle, the United States Navy lost four PBYs, and Eleventh AF lost one B-17, two B-26s and one LB-30 (B-24A) bombers and two P-40 fighters. The Japanese lost two A6M \\"Zero\\" fighters, and possibly a third due to ground anti-aircraft fire. One A6M \\"Zero\\", three D3A \\"Val\\" dive bombers and one E8N \\"Dave\\"reconnaissance seaplane were shot down in aerial combat. Eleventh Air Force also dispatched B-26 Marauder medium bombers of the 77th Bombardment Squadron. They arrived at about noon to locate the Japanese aircraft carriers and counterattack; however, they landed at Fort Glenn about 1:30pm due to fog and low visibility. The Marauders were carrying airborne torpedoes, rather than contact bombs which they were designed to carry. In addition to the Dutch Harbor attack, Japanese forces landed on Kiska Island on 6 June; Attu Island on 7 June, seizing both. The Japanese attacks on Dutch Harbor, however, inflicted only minor damage on the base, which were quickly repaired. The mission of Fort Glen Army Air Base was changed to serve as the initial forward base to launch bombing attacks against the Japanese forces in the Aleutians. Known Air Force units deployed to Fort Glenn were: * 28th Bombardment Group : 21st Bombardment Squadron, LB-30 Liberator :: Assigned to Hamilton Field, California, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 11 June 1942 :: Assigned to Fort Glenn AAB, 3 September 1942-19 September 1943 : 36th Bombardment Squadron, B-17E Flying Fortress, LB-30 Liberator :: Assigned to Elmendorf Field, Alaska Territory, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 4 June 1942-1 May 1943 : 73d Bombardment Squadron, B-25 Mitchell :: Assigned to Elmendorf Field, Alaska Territory, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning June 1942 :: Assigned to Fort Glenn AAB, April‚ÄìJune 1943 : 77th Bombardment Squadron, B-25 Mitchell, B-26 Marauder :: Assigned to Elmendorf Field, Alaska Territory, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 30 May-3 October 1942 : 404th Bombardment Squadron, B-24 Liberator :: Assigned to Will Rogers Field, Oklahoma, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 24 August-13 September 1942 * 343d Fighter Group : 11th Fighter Squadron, P-40 Warhawk :: Assigned to Elmendorf Field, Alaska Territory, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 26 May‚ÄìJune 1942 :: Assigned to Fort Glenn AAB, June 1942-20 February 1943 : 54th Fighter Squadron, P-40 Warhawk :: Assigned to Elmendorf Field, Alaska Territory, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 6 June-19 September 1942 : 344th Fighter Squadron, P-40 Warhawk :: Assigned to Fort Glenn AAB, 8 March-23 May 1943 36th Bombardment Squadron LB-30 Liberator and a Boeing B-17E Fortress (41-9126) at Fort Glenn AAB, June 1942 By the close of 1942, Fort Glenn AAB had 10,579 personnel assigned, but its role as an advanced air base had been supplanted by new air bases on Adak and Amchitka Islands in early 1943 farther to the west. By the end of the year, the base had become a backwater; its mission to provide housing and rations for transient personnel and the servicing of transient aircraft. =Closure= After the war ended, Fort Glenn remained open as a refueling stop for transient aircraft in the Aleutians along with Military Air Transport Service flights using the Great Circle Route from Japan to the United States. The main runway, however, was extended to to accommodate large, long range aircraft. By 1946, the base was manned only by skeleton staff due to the rapid demobilization of the Air Force. The last Air Force personnel were withdrawn by 30 September 1947, and the base was put on inactive status and was effectively abandoned.AFHRA Document 00001996 It was decommissioned in 1950 and the site was excessed between 1952-55 to the Bureau of Land Management. It was later transferred to numerous owners (Native corporations and the State of Alaska). Today hundreds of buildings, runways, and World War II artillery emplacements remain in various states of deterioration.\\" In 1987, the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Cape Field at Fort Glenn. The remains of the base are \\"the most comprehensive and intact World War II base in the Aleutian Islands\\" It is located on Umnak Island in the Aleutian Islands. Today Fort Glenn AAF is a virtual ghost town‚Äîexcept for a family of cattle ranchers who have renovated several World War II buildings and who call the base home. The expanse and undisturbed quality of the resource make Fort Glenn AAF an outstanding conceptual model for landscape preservation. In 1991, National Park Service historians visited the site to review the World War II-related construction, infrastructure, landscape, and objects. It was determined that any environmental cleanup should be designed to remove loose cables, transformers, hazardous material, toxic waste, and ordnance. Nontoxic World War II-related objects such as empty barrels could be left in place; full barrels would be, of course, another issue. All other buildings, structures, and infrastructure‚Äîno matter how \\"unsightly\\"‚Äîwould be left intact and preserved: in this case preservation can simply mean avoidance and the acceptance that the buildings and structures have a definite place within the landscape. On Saturday July 12, 2008, nearby Mount Okmok, erupted, sending ash 50,000 feet in the air and forcing the evacuation of the residents of the ranch. The eruption obliterated all remains of the South Pacifier Emergency landing strip, although some evidence of remains still are visible in aerial imagery.

The Chilean steamer was captured by the Spanish frigate Gerona, on 22 August 1866 off the island of Madeira. Tornado had arrived in Madeira under the command of Juan MacPherson, an English commander in service of the Chilean Navy. The Chilean ship had sailed to Madeira on 21 August to make provisions of charcoal and food supplements and to recruit sailors for its crew. Although the intent was to remain until 23 August, at 14:00 hours on 22 August the watch aboard ship alerted the captain to the presence of an armed vessel, the Spanish frigate Gerona. Captain McPherson decided to leave all his supplies on the dock and got the ship underway 90 minutes after the first sighting of Gerona. In its haste, Tornado had not been inspected by or granted permission to leave port from the Portuguese authorities in Madeira. Two blank charges were fired to signal that Tornado should stop, but Tornado continued out of port. Gerona had been sent from C√°diz under the command of captain Benito Ruiz de la Escalera specifically to capture Tornado and its sister ship, Cyclone. The firing of the charges alerted Gerona of the presence of Tornado and Gerona gave chase. At 22:30 Gerona fired a blank shot. Tornado continued to ignore the intent. Gerona followed up with three live shots; Tornado stopped its engines and struck its colors. The crew of Tornado was transferred to Gerona. Tornado was manned by a prize crew commanded by naval lieutenant Manuel de Bustillo y Pery.

Hepadnaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause liver infections in humans and animals. They are Group VII viruses that possess double-stranded DNA genomes and replicate using reverse transcriptase. This unique replication strategy, combined with their extremely small genomes and a very narrow host and tissue tropism, has distinguished them enough to be classified in the family Hepadnaviridae. There are two recognized genera: *Orthohepadnavirus, type species: hepatitis B virus (HBV) *Avihepadnavirus, type species: duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) Structure Figure 1, Simplified drawing for antigene structures of HBV virions: HBsAg, surface antigenes; HBcAg, core antigenes; HBeAg, e antigenes; DNA polymerase. With the example of human HBV: the particular feature of the HBV structure is the presence of three different forms in the plasma of infected patients: * Dane particle (diameter ‚âà 42 nm): the complete virion, which is infectious and consists of an enveloped icosahedral nucleocapsid containing the viral genome, consisting of core protein and protecting the partially double-stranded DNA genome, bounding with DNA polymerase. The capsid is enveloped by a lipid bilayer that contains three forms of envelope proteins: small (S) proteins, intermediated (M) proteins, and large (L) proteins, and these proteins have different surface antigenes domains which contribute the viral infectivity: L protein (Pre S1, Pre S2, S), M protein (Pre S2, S), S protein (S). In figure 1, showing the simplified structure of HBV particles. * Subviral sphere particles (diameter ‚âà 22 nm), these smaller, non-infectious and are the most abundant particle in the blood of an infected one. They are assumed to have the ability of absorbing virus- neutralizing antibodies to facilitate the virus spread and maintenance in the host.Visualization and Characterization Of hbv-Receptor Interactions, by Anja. Meier, Faculty of Life Sciences (2010),volume 92, pages 3-6. * Filaments (diameter ‚âà 22 nm, length: 50 nm-70 nm), which are less known about, but they are actually consisted of many subviral sphere particles. =Genome= Figure 2, the simplified drawing of organization of HBV genomes. With four ORFs:S (ORF S), X (ORF X), C (ORF Core), P (ORF P, the longest one among the four.); and partially doubled strains DNA, the minus-strain is longer than the plus- strain. As with the example of HBV, showing in figure 2, four open reading frames are encoded (ORFs), all ORFs are in the same direction, defining the minus- and plus-strands. And the virus has four known genes, which encode the core protein, the virus polymerase, surface antigens (preS1, preS2, and S) and the X protein. The minus-strand DNA is complete and spans the entire genome, while the plus strand spans only about two-thirds of the genome length and have variable 3' ends. But for the avihepadnaviruses they normally extend plus-strands almost all the way to the modified 5' end. The minus-strand is linked to the viral reverse transcriptase and can encode all the known viral proteins, but the plus-strain cannot encode viral proteins. Replication Figure 3, the invasion stages of HBV into the host cells. With the example of HBV: the mechanisms of infecting hepatocytes are still not well understood, but among the studies, it was revealed that the PreS1 domain of the L protein, plays a critical role in the infection, thus exhibiting different host specificity between different hepadnaviruses. Figure show the general process of the HBV infecting host cell: attachment-entry-uncoating-replicate-assembly- release. About the viral entry, several proteins have been identified as possible virus receptors, and studies show that the binding of virion with receptors can be neutralized by anti-PreS1 antibodies. The replication is the unique reverse transcriptase strategy: after uncoating, nucleocapsids are transported to the host cell nucleus, the virion DNA will be converted into covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA, the template for the transcription of the viral RNAs. Then undergoes transcription by the host cell RNA polymerase and the transcript is translated by host cell ribosomes; the high capacity of this replicating part contributes many errors which may help the virus adapt to the host. New virus particles are formed, which acquire lipid from the endoplasmic reticulum of the host cell, and the genome is packaged within these particles, which then bud off from the cell; and some part of the new genome may return to the host cell nucleus for replication more genomes. Phylogenetic tree All the members of family hepadnaviridae share remarkable similarities in the genome organization and the replication strategies, however, it also shows the differences between different species, different genotypes, and different subtypes. The species specificity of them are determined, to some extent, at the level of virus entry, involving the PreS1 part of the large envelop protein L, which could be a reason for their specificity of host range. =Orthohepadnavirus= Viruses in this genus infect mammals, including human, apes, and rodents, with a narrow host range for each virus. The only known natural host for HBV is human, chimpanzees maybe infected experimentally. The orthohepadnaviruses have been divided into four distinct species, with HBV (human hepatitis B virus), WHV (woodchuck hepatitis virus), GSHV (ground squirrel hepatitis virus ), and WMHBV (woolly monkey hepatitis B virus) as the prototypes, based on the host range from a limited number of studies. From the result of molecular studies about the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays, information about the number and geographic distribution of HBV genotypes and naturally occurring HBV mutants are gained. Eight HBV genotypes, A to H, have been identified in human and three closely related genotypes in apes are found, like gibbon, orangutan, chimpanzee; and he eight HBV genotypes have further diverged into at least 24 subgenotypes. With different analysis, including analysis of recombinants, the new Genotype J was provisionally assigned to be a genetic variant of HBV which is divergent from known human and ape genotypes, it was isolated from a Japanese patient. =Avihepadnavirus= Viruses in this genus exclusively infect birds; duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and heron hepatitis B virus (HHBV) are the prototypes. Avihepadnaviruses have been detected in various duck species. As the same with the orthohepadnaviruses, avihepadnaviruses have a rather narrow host range, but its common host are ducks and geese, other possible hosts are herons, stocks and crane. =Differences between orthohepadnaviruses and avihepadnaviruses= *Low nucleotide sequence identity *Differences in genome size, with genomes of orthohepadnaviruses generally larger than that of avihepadnaviruses *Larger core proteins and no M surface for avihepadnaviurses; for orthohepadnaviruses, virions and filaments are enriched in L proteins and empty spheres consist predominantly of S proteins, while for duck hepatitis B virus, L and S proteins are distributed evenly between particle types *Different host range restrictions (exclusively mammals for orthohepadnaviruses and exclusively birds for avihepadnaviruses) *Different predominant transmission strategies (horizontal transmission for orthohepadnaviruses and vertical transmission for avihepadnaviruses) Transmission =Orthohepadnaviruses= Within humans *Horizontal Direct transmission *person-to-person *From healthcare workers *Sexual contact *Parenteral exposure Indirectly *Unsafe medical practices *Transfusions and haemodialysis *Vertical Perinatal period Mother-to- offspring Until 2000, there were more than 5.2 million cases of acute hepatitis B infection, and chronically infects approximately 5% of the human population. HBV is the most common one among those hepatitis viruses. It can cause chronic infection of liver in humans, which has become a global public health problem, since chronic hepatitis can cause cirrhosis or death from liver failure within certain times. And it is the major cause of HCC, contributing about 60-80% of the HCC cases around the world. HBV is transmitted by parenteral contact with body fluids, such as blood and lymph; perinatal exposure of infants to carrier mothers. It is thought that mother- to-child perinatal transmission and the establishment of a lifelong highly infectious carrier state are responsible for the observed high rates of endemicity in high-prevalence regions such as South and East Asia and sub- Saharan Africa. In some cases breast milk of HBsAg positive mothers has been found to be positive for the virus, but there have not been any reports of HBV transmission through breast-feeding, even before the availability of hepatitis B vaccine for infants. *Horizontal transmission: through directly contacts with infected body fluids, like blood and lymph, in ways like sexual contacts, from health-care workers, or parenteral exposure; indirectly through transfusions and haemodialysis, and contaminated medical practices. *Vertical transmission: through perinatal periods, mother to child. Cross-species transmission Cross-species transmission has not been proven yet, but if this occurs, the chance to eradicate HBV infection by immunization will be diminished due to the difficulty in controlling of natural virus reservoir. And increasing human encroachment on rainforest habitat and fragmentation of declining populations increases the interactions and consequently the risks of disease transmission between wild primates and human populations. Transmission of mammalian hepadnavirus strains between cross-species primate hosts has been found in many cases, recombination of hepadnavirus strains from cross-species primate hosts, further demonstrates that primate associated HBV strains can indeed share hosts in nature, and cross-species transmission of primate- associated HBV strains provides the probability of interspecies recombination. =Within non-human mammals= * Gibbon HBV: Between gibbon and chimpanzee: the inoculation of GiHBV to a chimpanzee resulted in the acute hepatitis infection, and the virus isolated from the infected chimpanzee was GiHBV too. * Woolly monkey HBV: Since black-handed spider monkey belongs to the same family and subfamily as the woolly monkey, it was chosen as a suitable small primate model to study WMHBV. The results showed that the black-handed spider monkey was susceptible to WMHBV, but developed only a subclinical infection. The susceptibility of chimpanzees to WMBHV was only limited. * WHV: has only been detected in eastern woodchucks (Marmota monax), and does not infect related alpine marmosets. It infects woodchucks, but not other rodents like ground squirrels. But HDV with a WHV envelope (wHDV) has been shown to infect chimpanzees, and primary human hepatocytes. Vice versa a human enveloped hHDC could enter and (transiently) infect woodchuck hepatocytes in vivo without the need for a helper virus, but an infection of woodchucks or primary woodchuck hepatocytes with HBV has not been described. * GSHV: infects woodchucks and ground squirrels, specifically some species of squirrel (Spermophilus beecheyi and Spermophilus richardsonii) and the phylogenetically closely related chipmunks. GSHV runs a milder course when inoculated into woodchucks with the delayed onset of HCC. =Between humans and non-human mammals= Since the similarity between human and apes, and common ancestors human and apes shared long time ago, there are possibilities to happen transmission of HBVs among them. The prevalence of HBV infection in the natural primate habitat is unknown. Most data resulted from the studies performed on samples obtained from captive animals, wild-born or captive-born. Human HBV infects only humans and closely related primates, such as chimpanzee, chacma baboon, and to some extent, tree shrew, but does not infect woolly monkeys. HBV isolates have been shown to infect gibbon apes and chimpanzees, but not convincing evidence of an infection of macaques or other members of the Cercopithecidea family. Macaca sylvanus is able to replicate HBV in vivo replication in primary macaque hepatocytes. However, susceptibility of these animals has not been shown. * Gibbons: studies show that the vertical transmission is essential in the transmission of HBV in the non-human primates. But, there is also a possibility of horizontal transmission confirmed by HBV DNA detection in gibbon saliva. If the gibbons were housed in the same habitat, they would likely transmit HBV to the other gibbons through sexual contact or horizontal transmission of family members. * Chimpanzees: viral hepatitis had been known to occur in captive chimpanzees even prior to the discovery of HBV. Many studies used the chimpanzee models which have been limited now, showed that shortly after the first cloning of the HBV genome, the cloned DNA was infectious in chimpanzees, mostly developed hepatic pathology similar to the acute HBV infection in human, but they did not develop a chronic liver disease. * Tupaias: they are susceptible to the human HBV. However, the experimental infection is not highly efficient and causes only a mild, transient infection with low viral titers. Primary hepatocytes isolated from the liver of Tupaias are well susceptible to HBV infection. * Mice: Several researchers developed transgenic mice in order to study the expression of coding regions for the surface antigens, products of preS, S, and X gene of HBVs. The transgenic mice were not susceptible to HBV, but mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) can develop chronic liver disease. In addition, they permitted HBV to replicate in human hepatocytes that were able to proliferate in these mice. In general, these results imply that nonhuman primate HBV variants may be transmittable to humans. At least they infect representatives of the families Pongidae and Hylobatidae. However, at present it remains to be elucidated if nonhuman primate HBV variants are transmittable to humans and whether they cause disease in humans. And till now, no report of HBV transmission from captive animals to humans currently exists. However the potential for zoonotic disease transmission exists where blood or body fluid exposure is common. Such scenarios could include chronically infected animals kept as family pets, close contact with caretakers, in situations in which chimpanzees are slaughtered and used as bushmeat. =Avihepadnaviruses= Within birds Many cases about avihepadnaviruses transmission between or within species have been studied. * DHBV: infects only certain duck and goose species, but does not even infect Muscovy ducks or chickens, or infects them inefficiently. * Heron HBV: does not infect ducks and only infects primary duck hepatocytes very inefficiently. Studies on different heron species which are geographically isolated populations suggest that lateral transmission, virus adaptation and environmental factors all play a role in HHBV spreading and evolution, but it is not clear whether HHBV infection occurs at all in free- living herons, due to the possibility of cross-species virus transmission. * Crane HBV: cranes are phylogenetically very distant from ducks and are more closely to herons and stocks, but CHBV infects primary duck hepatocytes with efficiency similar to DHBV. Between humans and birds There is no evidence for transmission of avian hepadnavirus between avian and human, but recombination of avihepadnavirus strains between cross-species avian hosts can offer potentials for the transmission between human and bird, considering that many birds are one of the main sources of food for human. =Factors affecting transmission= ;Species specificity The special replication strategy gives this genus a special character, but also the high replication capacity and high error rate of the viral reverse transcriptase, thus HBVs from this genus have the ability to adapt to the host's environment, and varies from different hepadnaviruses, thus exhibiting species specificities. ;Proteins Pre S1 regions of the L protein, exhibiting different host specificity, if proteolytically being removed from HBV particles results in a loss of infectivity. The S protein therefore is needed, but not sufficient for HBV entry. In contrast to the M protein, the L protein is essential for the viral infectivity. These special proteins plays different role in different viruses, thus determining the different host ranges, if this were strictly true, we would expect that divergence in pre-S would affect cross-species infection, which then can contribute the different transmission of different hepadnaviruses. *Replacing the special region of the envelope protein of one hepadnavirus with another hepadnavirus's. HHBV by DHBV:infect ducks and derived primary hepatocytes WMHBV by HBV:infect human hepatocytes *Subviral sphere particles: They are assumed to have the ability of absorbing virus- neutralizing antibodies to facilitate the virus spread and maintenance in the host. =Potentials= ;Co-infection A lot of studies have well characterized the horizontal transmission of HBV through parenteral routes and co-infections with different genotypes of HBV have also been reported, including genotypes A and D, genotypes A and G, and genotypes B and C. In Asia, genotypes B and C account for almost all HBV infections. Infection with genotype C may induce more severe liver diseases than infection with genotype B. Recombination between genotypes B and C can occur as the result of co-infection of the two genotypes and recombinant strains may possess an enhanced disease-inducing capacity compared with genotype B. It has also been reported that the predominance of recombinant strains between genotypes B and C might be associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in young carriers in Taiwan. ;Recombination Though the hepadnaviruses have a very limited host range, with the potential cross-species transmission of hepadnavirus among primates and some families of birds, combined with recombinants, it might change the hepadnavirus host specificity. Interspecies recombination between hepadnaviruses from cross-species hosts would provide a large variation of virus genome, which will change the pathogenicity and transmissibility, and enlarge the host range; the first evidence of potential recombination between chimpanzee HBV and human HBV genome was documented, recombination between human and non-human primate HBV strains, between GiHBV strains from different genera of gibbons, and between birds HBV strains from different avian sub- families were confirmed. All those experiments provided data allowing us to better understand the background, virus hosts, and zoonotic transmission of the non-human primate HBVs.

The Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany, p. 227, Yale University Press, 2000, Newhaven & London. It is a scheduled ancient monument. Description and measurements It is located in farmland at an altitude of c. on a terraced hillside leading up to a prominent summit called Mither Tap. It has been suggested to once have consisted of 12 stones, 4 of which remain standing, with another four fallen, the final four presumed to have been moved.Logan, J., Archaeologia, 22, pp. 200‚Äì2, 1829. The recumbent altar stone is wide, high and deep, it has been estimated to weigh over ten tonnes. It is made is of a type of white grained granite that has been suggested to have been brought some distance to the location. It was suggested that it was designed to create an artificial skyline, horizontally levelled with chockstones; one of which is still visible under the stone. The eastern flanker stone is wide and made of dark grey basalt with a round top. The western flanker stone is wide and made of reddish quartzite bearing inclusions of white quartz and having a pointed top. The stone east of the east flanker is made of red granite. There is also an outlying stone to the southeast of the circle that is high and made of white quartz with roseate seams.Ritchie, J., Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, 52, p. 98, 1917‚Äì18.Bradley, R., Discovery and Excavation in Scotland, 1, p. 9, 2000.Bradley, R., Antiquity, 74, pp. 465‚Äì66, 2000.

The circle also displays suggested rock art including cup marks and a noticeable rounded bump on the recumbent stone that resembles the outline of the prominent hill behind it. Astronomical alignments It was discovered in the 1980s that Balquhain had lunar associations. The eastern flanker is aligned to the most southerly moonrise at 172 degrees, whilst the western flanker is aligned to the minor moonset at 232 degrees. The major moonset is aligned over the central hump of the recumbent stone at 190 degrees.

She went on to study criminology at the School of Criminology, University of California, Berkeley, where she got her Ph.D. in 1967. She held a professorship in criminology at the School of Criminology, Universit√© de Montr√©al. She continued to work, until her death, doing research, teaching and publishing. In 1999/2000 and again in 2000/2001, she taught a course on \\"Gender, Colour and Legal Norms\\" in the Masters Program at the International Institute for the Sociology of Law in Onati, Spain. Marie-Andr√©e Bertrand died on March 6, 2011 in Montreal.  Main areas of research  The focus of Bertrand's research was on three areas: drug policy, the treatment of women by criminal justice agencies, and, more generally, critical, feminist theory concerning criminology and sociology of law. Among her main works is an international comparison of female criminality (1979, 2003) and a comparative analysis of women's prisons(1998).  Activism  Bertrand went beyond mere academic work in several fields. As a young professor, she served as one of 5 Commissioners on the Le Dain Commission, which was charged to look into the effects of non-medical drug use on Canadian society. The commission's final report came out in favour of repealing the prohibition against simple possession of cannabis (3 of the Commissioners: LeDain, Lehmann and Stein), along with two minority reports one to maintain the prohibition for all cannabis offences (Campbell) and the other, by Marie- Andree Bertrand, to adopt full legalization of cannabis.[Cannabis, A Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs (LeDain Report), 1972] Later, she joined Marco Pannella and his International Antiprohibitionist League, becoming eventually president of the organization. Among her causes was also the abolition of prisons, which goal she called \\"a necessary utopia\\".Does Abolitionism Have a Future? Documentation of an Email Exchange among Abolitionists. 2007, downloaded on March 10, 2011 But first and last, she was an untiring feminist.

The present church dates largely from the 13th and 14th centuries and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. Architecture USAF chaplain is addressing a small congregation. Sulgrave has had a church since the Anglo- Saxon era, although not on the current site. An earlier stone church is believed to have stood about north of the present one, on higher ground near the windmill. The church on the present site was built in the 13th century, when the Cluniac Priory of St Andrew, Northampton held the advowson. At least some material from the original church was used in the rebuilding. Most notable is a triangular-headed doorway, characteristic of Anglo-Saxon architecture, that has been re-set as the west door of the west tower. This may date from the 10th century. The bell-openings to the top stage of the tower and the trefoiled lancet windows to the ground stage are Early English Gothic features that date it to the 13th century. The tower had a spire, but it collapsed in the 14th century. A record from about 1340 reports the church as \\"destroyed\\", and 20 carts being at \\"Helmydene\\" (Helmdon, southeast of Sulgrave) to collect stone for its repair. Helmdon stone is a fine freestone and was certainly the best building stone in the area. The work for which Helmdon stone was supplied may therefore have included the south aisle. This was added in the middle of the 14th century and retains all of its original Decorated Gothic windows. The four-bay arcade between the south aisle and the nave is Perpendicular Gothic and therefore somewhat later. Also in the south aisle is a squint to the high altar in the chancel, and a 14th- or 15th- century piscina, both of which were installed when the aisle had a side altar. The squint was blocked after the Reformation but reopened in 1885. The south door is 14th century. Outside it is the south porch, which is 16th-century Elizabethan with a characteristically Tudor four-centred arch. Over it is a datestone with the initials ER and year 1564. Elizabeth I visited Northampton that year so the initials may commemorate her visit. The chancel has two south windows: the more easterly is Decorated Gothic and therefore earlier; the more westerly is Perpendicular Gothic. The baptismal font is octagonal and may date from the 1660s. In 1840 the nave walls were raised by about , the ancient oak roof was replaced with a new deal one and the windows were reduced in height, all to accommodate the installation of galleries to increase the church's capacity. In 1885 the galleries were removed and the oak roof was restored. In the same year to compensate for the loss of the galleries the north aisle was added, re-using the 14th-century north doorway. The three-light east window of the chancel is also 19th-century Gothic Revival. The two-light east window of the south aisle includes four stained glass coats of arms of successive generations of the Washington family. Each is surrounded by strapwork in white and yellow glass and they are probably 16th-century. Furnishings St James' has an ancient wooden chest, hewn from a solid oak trunk and said to be 14th- century. It has two compartments and is bound with closely spaced iron bands. In the south aisle is the Washington Pew, a 17th-century pew that was installed when the Washington family held Sulgrave Manor. In 1929 a wooden screen was installed separating the ground stage of the tower from the nave to create a vestry. It was funded by the Women's Committee of the George Washington Institute and made by craftsmen of Broadway, Worcestershire. The Colonial Dames of America presented the church with a pipe organ in 1930. This was replaced with a new one in 1975. Monuments Under the floor of the east end of south aisle is the tomb Amee Washington who died in 1564, and her husband Lawrence who died in 1584. The tomb is covered by a slab of Hornton ironstone with monumental brasses set into it. There were originally six brasses in the set: a pair of figures of Lawrence and Amee Washington; a pair of smaller brasses, one their four sons, and one of their seven daughters; a brass of a family coat of arms and one with an inscription. The brasses of Amee Washington, the family coat of arms and the inscription are missing. In 1889 the two brasses of the children and the head of the brass of Lawrence Washington were stolen. They were recovered in 1923 and reinstalled in 1924 but no-one was ever charged with their theft. In 1659 the Washingtons sold Sulgrave Manor, and in about 1673 it passed to a member of the Hodges family. On the south wall of the south aisle above the Washington pew are three neoclassical wall monuments to members of the Hodges family. The largest and most ornate is that to the brothers John and Rev Moses Hodges, both of whom died in 1724. It is of grey and white marble and has fluted pilasters. Bells and clock In 1552 during the Edwardine Reformation the church was listed as having four bells in the west tower plus a sanctus bell. The churchwardens, John Humfrey and John Mayo, had sold one of the bells for ¬£16 to pay for road and ford repairs in the parish. The buyers, Thomas Stuttesbury and Lawrence Washington, had so far paid ¬£6, and the bell remained in the belfry until the balance was paid. None of the bells listed in 1552 survives, but their metal may have been re-used in casting the present ones. The Sanctus bell was medieval, but in 1806 it was recast by John Briant of Hertford. One of the Newcombe family of bellfounders of Leicester cast the present third bell in 1610 and the fourth in 1612. Edward Hall of Drayton Parslow in Buckinghamshire cast the fifth bell in 1744. Matthew Bagley of Chacombe cast the second bell in 1769. John Briant of Hertford cast the tenor bell in 1808, making a ring of five. Gillett & Johnston of Croydon recast all five of the ring in 1928. This was increased to six when John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast the present treble bell in 1932. The present turret clock in the west tower was made and installed in 1928. Benefice The parish is part of the benefice of Culworth, with Sulgrave and Thorpe Mandeville, and Chipping Warden, with Edgcote and Moreton Pinkney. It is in the deanery of Brackley, the archdeaconry of Northampton, and the Diocese of Peterborough.

Alumni of Smokers squads regularly reunited for exhibition games during the 1950s and 1960s, usually against the Tampa Tarpons. These games were played at Al L√≥pez Field, the Tarpons' home ballpark which was built in 1955 and named after the Smokers' (and Tampa's) most famous baseball figure. Ballparks The minor league Smokers played their home games at Plant Field, which was located just across the Hillsborough River from downtown Tampa. Plant Field had been built by Henry B. Plant as part of his Tampa Bay Hotel resort, and the Smokers shared the large multi-use facility with everything from auto racing to the Florida State Fair. Semi-pro and amateur versions of the Smokers played at smaller ballfields around town, often Cuscaden Park in Ybor City or Macfarlane Park in West Tampa.Cuscaden Park @ tampapix.com Players In all their incarnations, the Tampa Smokers featured many local ballplayers, including many Latin players from Ybor City and West Tampa, and usually had strong community support.

It is located at the intersection of Oxford Terrace and Worcester Street in the Christchurch Central City, New Zealand. The statue, carved by Scott's widow Kathleen Scott, is registered as a Category II historic place. The statue toppled off its plinth in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and broke in half; it was temporarily on display in the Christchurch Earthquake Museum in City Mall. The Scott statue was reinstated in October 2017. Context Quail Island in Lyttelton Harbour in 1910 The explorer Scott had used Christchurch and Lyttelton as his New Zealand base for the British National Antarctic Expedition, 1901‚Äì1904 and Terra Nova Expedition, 1910‚Äì1913. In between, Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition also used Lyttelton as the base for their attempt to reach the South Pole, but they failed to get there. The objective of the Terra Nova Expedition was to be the first to reach the geographical South Pole. Scott and four companions reached the pole on 1912, to find that a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen had preceded them by 33 days. Scott's entire party died on the return journey from the pole. Their deaths resulted in them being treated as heroes throughout the British Empire. The remaining crew returned to New Zealand and came ashore in British Empire, from where a coded message was cabled to the expedition's organiser in Britain. The fate of the expedition's team became public knowledge on 11 February 1913. A memorial oak was planted in the street leading to the harbourmaster's house, from where the message was relayed. The next memorial was erected in Queenstown, where two stone tablets were attached to a boulder in the Queenstown Gardens. A few months later, a memorial was erected in Port Chalmers, as this was the last harbour where the Terra Nova had visited before proceeding to Antarctica. History Scott Statue in 1917 with the inscription in the plinth still visible The Mayor of Christchurch, Henry Holland, called for a public meeting to organise a memorial fund within one week of the news of Scott's death. A committee was formed and over ¬£1,000 was raised. Whilst the form of the memorial or its location had not been decided upon, the committee wrote to Scott's widow and enquired about her thoughts. This resulted in her being engaged to sculpt a statue of her late husband. The commission was for Kathleen Scott to create a replica of the bronze statue erected in Waterloo Place in London in 1915. The rising costs of metal caused by World War I made marble a more cost effective option. She went to carve the statue in Carrara in Italy in March 1916, as the importation of marble into Britain had been banned. She said about the block that was measuring : > You will be glad to hear that it is a remarkably fine piece of marble, of a > good colour and without any flaw whatever. Considering the great size this > is very fortunate. The statue was finished in April 1916, but was not shipped until October of that year due to the war. It was unveiled by the Governor, The Earl of Liverpool, on the corner of Worcester Street and Oxford Terrace on 9 February 1917, facing north and looking towards the building that was then the civic offices. The inscription on the plinth, which is one of his last diary entries, reads: > I do not regret this journey, which shows > that Englishmen can endure hardships, > help one another, and meet death with > as great fortitude as ever in the past. The inscription had become unreadable by 1922 and a separate marble plaque with this text was installed at the entrance to the reserve. Another plaque lists the names of the five men who died. Recognition grew of Kathleen Scott after the 1995 publication of a biography, and in 1998 a further plaque was added recognising her: > This statue was sculpted by Kathleen Scott FRSBS (1878‚Äì1947) Widow of > Captain Scott, and was unveiled in 1917. Scott Statue fallen off its plinth during the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, with the legs broken off The statue was not quite finished. The details of the gloves have not been done, and one of the legs rests against a stump to support the figure. Kathleen Scott had offered to undertake this additional work when she returned to Christchurch, but this did not eventuate. The statue toppled off its plinth in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. It broke into two pieces and was put into storage. It was on public display during the November 2012 Icefest, and, from January 2016, was on display in Christchurch's Earthquake Museum, which is part of the Canterbury Museum, in City Mall. Heritage listing On 26 November 1981, the statue was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category II historic place, with the registration number being 1840. It is one of seven memorials that Kathleen Scott sculpted after her husband's death. It also demonstrates Christchurch's link with Antarctic exploration, being the base for Shackleton and Scott in the past, and being the Gateway to the Antarctic by providing the Italian, New Zealand and United States of America bases these days at Christchurch International Airport.

Holy Trinity Church: 1829‚Äì1972 As a developing spa town, Tunbridge Wells was short of church capacity, and had no parish church. In 1818, the Church Commissioners created a fund to provide new churches in growing towns, for which it was decided by the residents and visitors to the town to apply for. Led by Lord Abergavenny, a subscription fund was started, which raised the ¬£10,591 construction costs. Architect Decimus Burton (1800‚Äì1881), who had already been commissioned to design villas in Calverley Park, agreed to design the building, to a then popular Gothic Revival architecture style. Built in locally quarried sandstone from Calverley Quarry, the first stone was laid on 17 August 1827. Constructed by Mr Barrett of Tunbridge Wells, the finished church, which cost just over ¬£12,000 to complete including fitting out, was consecrated in September 1829. Due to the popularity of Tunbridge Wells in the Victorian age, a number of churches were built in the town. Hence following the fall in congregation numbers after World War II, the town had a number of churches which were in great need of major maintenance. As the largest church in the town, it was decided to decommission it. The church held its last religious service in 1972. Derelict: 1973-1981 In 1974 the Church Commissioners declared Holy Trinity \\"redundant to pastoral needs,\\" thereby allowing for its potential demolition, and redevelopment of the site as housing or offices. However, after a petition was raised by the Royal Tunbridge Wells Civic Society, the commissioners gave the society one year to find a suitable public use for the building. After approving in principle a plan to turn the building into a community theatre and arts centre in 1976, ¬£50,000 was raised in six months, to allow a long term lease to be agreed from January 1977 with the Diocese of Rochester. Trinity Theatre: 1982-present Supported by Tunbridge Wells Borough Council (¬£15,000), Kent County Council and Arts Council England, over a five-year period the internal redevelopment addressed dry rot and damaged stonework, to turn the building into a theatre with 350 raked seats. Subsequent grants have allowed developments to include a cafeteria, public bar, and redevelopment of the side vestibules to allow for art shows and local arts classes. In March 1996 an application was approved by the National Lottery for ¬£600,000 of additional internal improvements, which provided a computerised box office, new seats, and an access ramp for wheelchair users. In its now 25-year history, Trinity Theatre has collaborated with performers and groups from Steven Berkoff to the Royal National Theatre, as well as hosting international performing arts, film and visual arts. With over 90,000 people now coming through its doors annually, Trinity is acknowledged as one of the leading arts and performance venues in the South East of England. =Tunbridge Wells Theatre Club= Originally launched in 1946 as the Tunbridge Wells Drama Club, after the church became available in 1977, the club and its committee became central to the buildings revival. After the restoration of the building in 1982, it renamed itself as Trinity Theatre Club. Today it is one of the most active amateur theatre clubs in the southeast, putting on four productions per annum.

Members of this family are characterized by their thick, sausage-like oral arms.Wild Fact Sheets Description Members of the family Catostylidae are small marine jellyfish with domed bells. The eight short oral arms are broad and three-sided. There is a network of branching canals linked with the primary ring canal, but these are not joined to the gastrovascular cavity except through the sixteen or thirty two radial canals. Some of these radial canals do not extend to the edge of the bell. There are eight sense organs, known as rhopalia, which have canals extending to the margin of the bell.Catostylidae These jellyfish swim in jerks by contracting their circular and radial muscles, which decreases the volume of water enclosed under the bell, before relaxing them again and repeating the sequence. They have no control over the direction of locomotion and drift with the currents and tides.Catostylidae Genera * Acromitoides :* Acromitoides purpurus (Mayer, 1910) :* Acromitoides stiphropterus (Schultze, 1897) * Acromitus :* Acromitus flagellatus (Haeckel) :* Acromitus maculosus Light, 1914 * Catostylus :* Catostylus cruciatus (Lesson, 1830) :* Catostylus mosaicus (Quoy & Gaimard, 1824) :* Catostylus ornatellus (Vanh√∂ffen, 1888) :* Catostylus ouwensi Moestafa & McConnaughey, 1966 :* Catostylus perezi Ranson, 1945 :* Catostylus tagi (Haeckel, 1869) :* Catostylus townsendi Mayer, 1915 :* Catostylus tripterus (Haeckel, 1880) :* Catostylus turgescens (Schulze, 1911) :* Catostylus viridescens (Chun, 1896) * Crambione :* Crambione bartschi (Mayer, 1910) :* Crambione mastigophora Maas, 1903 * Crambionella :* Crambionella helmbiru Nishikawa, Mulyadi & Ohtsuka, 2014 :* Crambionella orsini (Vanh√∂ffen) :* Crambionella stuhlmanni (Chun, 1896) * Leptobrachia :* Leptobrachia leptopus (Chamisso & Eysenhardt, 1821) References See also *Catostylus mosaicus Daktyliophorae ","title":"Catostylidae"},{"id":"31156021","text":"The Crescent School is an Independent preparatory coeducational Day School for pupils aged 3 ‚Äì 11 in Bilton, Rugby, Warwickshire, England.

He received the CNRS Silver Medal for his work on structural biology, especially the structures of human lipase/colipase, lectins and the development of moleculargraphics software.  Early life  Christian Cambillau was born in Perpignan to Madeleine Cambillau a social worker and August Cambillau an officer of the French airforce. He studied part of his childhood in different places (including Perpignan) and later in Paris when his family moved there. He obtained his Master in biology and chemistry at the University of Orsay, then continued on to do a Ph.D. at the same university in bio-mimetic chemistry (crown-ether and cryptates).  Career  After his Ph.D. (1978) he spent one year at ONERA for his military service. He was then hired by CNRS in the chemistry department (January 1, 1980). In 1982 he moved to Sweden to begin a two-year post-doc in the lab of Prof. Carl-Ivar Br√§nden, a pioneer of protein crystallography. Whilst there he worked to develop the TOM option in FRODO software, producing an automatic flexible protein-ligand docking software. He also participated to different works on protein crystallography and modelling. After Sweden he returned to France to work in the relatively new field of structural biology, joining a group in the CRMC2 laboratory located in Marseille on the Luminy Campus (Marseille University of science). He worked there for four years and developed a new molecular graphics program TURBO-FRODO. He then moved with the protein crystallography group when it was relocated to the Marseille North University Department. It's at the North University Department that he led his first team at the LCCMB lab (Laboratory of Crystallography and Crystallization of Biological Macromolecules) with this becoming one of the key points of his career. Whilst director he moved in 1995 to the Campus of Joseph Aiguier, where LCCMB became AFMB (Architecture et Fonction de Macromolecule Biologiques). He resigned the direction of the AFMB in 2004, with AFMB moving to the Luminy Campus in 2005.

Cyclone Rewa developed from a tropical disturbance on 28 December south of Nauru. After forming, Rewa moved southwest through the Solomon Islands, crossing the 160th meridian east from the South Pacific basin into the Australian region. The cyclone began to strengthen steadily and turned southward, paralleling the eastern Australian coast through 31 December. Rewa reached its initial peak intensity as a Category 4 tropical cyclone on 2 January. It maintained this intensity for about 12 hours before an increase in wind shear induced its weakening by 3 January. The cyclone turned southeastward and moved back into the South Pacific basin on 4 January, before it passed over New Caledonia between 5‚Äì6 January. After affecting New Caledonia, Rewa weakened to a tropical depression and turned northwestward before re-entering the Australian basin on 10 January. Over the following days, the cyclone showed signs of restrengthening and executed an elongated cyclonic loop to the southeast of Papua New Guinea. Rewa subsequently entered a phase of quick intensification while proceeding southeastward, peaking in intensity as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone. It recurved toward the southwest while gradually weakening for several days. Although forecasters had predicted Rewa to make landfall near Mackay, Queensland, the cyclone began interacting with an upper-level trough on 18 January, causing it to divert to the southeast and move along the Queensland coast. Rewa transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on 20 January, with its remnants bringing heavy rain to New Zealand three days later. The cyclone caused the deaths of 22 people on its course, affecting parts of the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Eastern Australia, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and New Zealand. Nine people in a banana dinghy en route to Rossel Island went missing at the height of the storm; they were presumed drowned after wreckage from their boat turned up at the island. In Queensland, three people died in traffic accidents caused by the storm, and another fatality occurred when a boy became trapped in a storm pipe. One death took place in New Caledonia, while flooding caused eight drownings in Papua New Guinea. After this usage of the name Rewa, the name was retired. Meteorological history Track map of Tropical Cyclone Rewa, based on data from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. During 26 December, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) started to monitor a tropical depression that had developed within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, about 575 km (355 mi) to the south-east of Nauru. Over the next few days the depression gradually developed and organised further, as it moved towards the west-southwest under the influence of a north-easterly steering flow. During 28 December, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P, before the FMS named it Rewa as it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Over the next few days, the system gradually intensified under the influence of favorable upper-level winds while it moved towards the south-southwest, passing through the Solomon Islands on 29 December and affecting the southeastern islands of Papua New Guinea. As it moved through the Solomon Islands, Rewa moved out of the South Pacific basin and into the Australian region, where the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) took the primary warning responsibility for the system. On 30 December, the JTWC reported that Rewa had become equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS); early the next day the BoM reported that the system had developed into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone, and an eye became visible on satellite imagery. The system then abruptly turned and started to move towards the south parallel to the Queensland coast because of an interaction with an upper-level trough of low pressure. On 2 January both the JTWC and the BoM reported that Rewa had reached its peak intensity, with the JTWC reporting that Rewa had peaked with 1-minute windspeeds of 230 km/h (145 mph), equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS. Meanwhile, the BoM reported that the system had peaked with 10-minute windspeeds of 205 km/h (125 mph) with a central pressure of , which made it a category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian Scale. Rewa remained at its peak intensity for 24 hours before the system started to weaken during 3 January, as strengthening upper level north-westerlies increased vertical wind shear over the system. Throughout that day, the cyclone started to move towards the south-east, before it started to take a more eastwards track as it approached 160¬∞E. During 4 January, Rewa moved back into the South Pacific basin and continued eastward as a weakening category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with the FMS estimating the 10-minute sustained windspeeds at 150 km/h (90 mph). During the next day, its eye became obscured after the mountains of New Caledonia affected Rewa's circulation by creating a hot and dry Foehn wind. The FMS reported that the system had weakened into a category 2 tropical cyclone, while the JTWC reported that Rewa had become a tropical storm. The system subsequently made landfall in the vicinity of Saint Vincent Bay on New Caledonia's south-western coast, before it emerged near Thio from the east coast during 6 January. By 7 January, Rewa's circulation had become exposed under the influence of upper level north-westerlies; as a result both the FMS and JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened into a depression. Over the next 3 days, the residual low-level circulation was steered towards the northwest and Papua New Guinea in a southeasterly trade wind flow generated by a powerful area of high pressure located between New Zealand and Kermadec Islands. During 10 January, Rewa's remnants moved out of the South Pacific basin and back into the Australian region while starting to re-intensify into a tropical cyclone, as a mid to upper level trough over eastern Australia increased in size. As moved into the Australian region, Rewa began to move in a long arc to the northwest and then to the north, and on 13 January, both the JTWC and the Papua New Guinea National Weather Service reported that the system had re- intensified into a tropical cyclone around Papua New Guinea's southern islands. Later that day, Rewa executed a sharp clockwise turn near Tagula Island and started to move towards the southeast and the BoM's area of responsibility while gradually intensifying further. During 15 January, the BoM reported that the system had re-intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone, while the JTWC reported that Rewa had become equivalent to a category 1 hurricane again. Later that day, the system started to rapidly intensify as an upper level trough approached the system. During the next day the JTWC reported that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 230 km/h (145 mph). The BoM then reported later that day, that Rewa had peaked with 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 205 km/h (125 mph), which made it a category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After it had peaked in intensity the system recurved towards the south-southwest, and started to gradually weaken. By 18 January the JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened into a tropical storm, while throughout that day the BoM assessed Rewa as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. During the next day, the BoM reported that Rewa had weakened into a category 2 tropical cyclone as it recurved and started to move towards the south-east about 265 km (165 mi) to the east of Mackay, Queensland. Over the next couple of days the system moved towards the south-southeast along the Queensland coast while maintaining its intensity. During 21 January, the BoM and the JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened below cyclone strength, as the system moved back into the South Pacific basin for the third and final time. Rewa's remnants were last noted late on 23 January, by New Zealand's Metservice, as they dissipated to the east of the South Island. Preparations and impact Twenty-two people lost their lives in accidents caused by Cyclone Rewa, while it affected parts off the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Australia, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and New Zealand. Due to the impact of this storm, the name Rewa was retired. =The Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and New Zealand= The Solomon Islands were affected by the developing tropical cyclone between 28‚Äì30 December and was the first Island country to be impacted by Rewa. As it developed into a tropical cyclone on 28 December, the system passed to the north of the outer lying atolls of Malaita Province in the Solomon Islands. Rewa then passed over the southern tip of Malaita Island, before passing to the south of Guadalcanal Island and the north of Rennell Island during 29 December. Cyclone Rewa started to affect New Caledonia on 5 January, before it passed over Grand Terre Island later that day. Rewa dumped over 300 mm (12 in) of rain on parts of the archipelago, which made all of the major rivers overflow and burst their banks. Several landslides and a death were recorded within New Caledonia, while on the Loyalty Island of Mare, waves from Rewa partially destroyed the harbour wall at Tadine's port. The system had no effect on Vanuatu while it passed through the Solomon Islands between 28 ‚Äì 30 December; however the southern islands of Vanuatu were affected by the cyclone after it had passed through New Caledonia during 5 January. As it moved towards the north-west between 6‚Äì8 January, Rewa brought high seas and strong winds to parts of the island nation including the provinces of Shefa and Tafea. Some damage was recorded to Port Villa's harbours intertidal zone, as the system passed about to the southeast of the city. Between 19‚Äì24 January, Rewa's remnants, a slow moving weather front over Fiordland and a southerly brought widespread rainfall and flooding to New Zealand's South Island. In Westland, Fiordland and the Southern Lakes, landslides and flooding occurred on 21 January, while several roads and bridges were damaged. =Papua New Guinea= Cyclone Rewa affected Papua New Guinea on two separate occasions while it was active, with the cyclone first affecting the archipelago between 28 December and 1 January, before grazing the archipelago between 12‚Äì14 January. Before Rewa affected the country, cyclone alerts and warnings were issued for Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands, while authorities urged people not to go to beaches. As it affected the archipelago, Rewa brought heavy rainfall, high seas, and wind gusts of up to 100 km/h (60 mph) to parts of the archipelago including Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands. The hardest hit areas were communities near major river systems, with the cyclone blocking roads, destroying a church, bridges, homes and gardens with vital crops such as coffee and copra destroyed. In total, Cyclone Rewa left around 3500 people homeless and caused 17 deaths, 8 of which were due to flooding. Nine other people went missing while travelling to Rossel Island after their boat was caught up in high seas associated with Rewa. They were later presumed dead by the National Disaster and Emergency Service, after a local search and rescue mission found wreckage of the boat. At 00:00 UTC on 30 December, the automatic weather station at Jingo on Rossel island recorded a maximum sustained wind of 55 km/h (35 mph). =Australia= During the opening days of 1994, Rewa moved southwards parallel to the Queensland coast; however, because it was located about 600 km (370 mi) to the north-east of Mackay, it was too far away from the coast for there to be any direct impact on Queensland. The only indirect impact was higher surf, from which several people had to be rescued from before the cyclone started to move towards New Caledonia during 4 January. As Rewa affected Queensland for the second time, watches and warnings were issued for various parts of Queensland by the BoM, who predicted a landfall near Mackay. On 18 January local disaster committees met to consider evacuating people, while people who were on vacation in national parks were alerted about Rewa by a helicopter. A military training exercise that was due to take place in Shoalwater Bay had to be cancelled, with army personal evacuated to Rockhampton to avoid being cut off by flood waters. Along the coast, several ports including Gladstone were shut with large vessels told to head to sea and small vessels told to batten down and prepare for the storm. On 19 January Rewa started to affect Queensland with torrential rain and storm force windspeeds which caused some damage along the coast. However it did not make its predicted landfall near Mackay, instead it recurved to the south-southeast and came to within 100 km (60 mi) of the coast. Two men off Yeppoon's coast were rescued from a fishing trawler by an army Black Hawk helicopter after high seas damaged the trawler's propeller and snapped its heavy anchor chain, leaving it drifting helplessly in the cyclone's path. The worst affected island was Lady Elliot as it bore the brunt of the wind, while on Heron Island, several rare trees and bird rookeries were either destroyed or severely damaged. As Rewa interacted with an upper trough of low pressure on 19 January, heavy rainfall and thunderstorms were observed in parts of Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Brisbane received over in just six hours, which led to some localised flash flooding in parts of the city and four deaths. Three of the deaths were from people crashing their cars, while the other death occurred when a person went surfing Brisbane's flood water and got trapped in a storm drain. Within Brisbane, 100 homes and 20 cars were damaged by the flood waters, while a Sheffield Shield cricket match between Western Australia and Queensland was delayed, after the Gabba resembled a small lake.

He is regarded as one of Australia's most prolific writers and entertainers.Hood, Alex (1935‚Äì) Biographical monograph at National Library of Australia Biography =Early life= Hood was born in Sydney and attended Homebush Boys High School, where he gained his Intermediate Certificate. As a teenager he was a keen cricketer but left school at age 15 to take up an apprenticeship as an electrician.Alex Hood interviewed by Keith McKenry [sound recording, National Library of Australia, 2002] He joined the Eureka Youth League, a communist youth association, meeting Bill Berry and Chris Kempster. Kempster, along with the older singer and folklorist John Meredith, a founding member of the (original) Bushwhackers (Australia's first bush band), were members of the Unity Singers, a Sydney left-wing choir formed in 1951. =Initial musical influences and career= In 1953 Reedy River, a new Australian musical play based around the 1891 Australian shearers' strike, was created, opening first at the Melbourne New Theatre and then subsequently in Sydney's New Theatre, also in 1953.McKenry, Keith. 2014. \\"More than a Life: John Meredith and the Fight for Australian Tradition.\\" Rosenberg Publishing, 488 pp. For the Sydney production, Meredith's Bushwhackers group were selected to provide the musical accompaniment; Hood spent some time \\"hanging around backstage\\" and, when Kempster had to take three months leave to perform his national service, the nineteen year old Hood, then known as Alec, deputised for him playing the part of \\"Snowy\\".

L-R: Barbara Lisyak, Chris Kempster, Alex Hood and Harry Kay. As a result of this involvement, Hood acquired a love of traditional Australian \\"bush\\" music and both he and Kempster became accepted members of the band, which however eventually led to friction between them (as the younger members) and Meredith, who decided that the best course of action was to disband the group in 1957, telling the various members that if they wanted to carry on performing, it would be under the auspices of the Sydney \\"Bush Music Club\\" (still in existence as at 2020) with which they had all been associated, but no longer under the \\"Bushwhackers\\" band name. Hood, together with Kempster on guitar and banjo and Harry Kay on harmonica then formed \\"The Rambleers\\", utilizing their preference to sing in harmony as opposed to the unison singing style of the Bushwhackers.Chris Kempster Obituary by Keith McKenry (First published in The Australian, February 2004) The group toured and released a 10-inch LP The Old Bark Hut followed with a 7-inch 33 rpm record Waltzing Matilda, both 1958, and also appeared in a 1960 stage production Fisher's Ghost, a play by Douglas Stewart based on the Fisher's Ghost legend, together with singers Barbara Lisyak and Denis Kevans.National Library of Australia: The Rambleers.

Chrgd broadcasts live-action and animated children's programming aimed towards male audiences ages 6‚Äì14. The channel first launched on June 1, 2011, under the ownership of Astral Media as a localized version of Disney XD, serving as a sister network to Family Channel (which, at that time, held rights to the programming of Disney XD's parent network Disney Channel). Following the acquisition of Astral Media by Bell Media, Disney XD was divested to DHX Media. On October 9, 2015, as a result of Corus Entertainment's acquisition of Canadian rights to Disney's children's programming and associated brands (which resulted in the launch of a new channel under the Disney XD brand), the channel was re-launched as Family Chrgd. History =As Disney XD= In April 2009, Astral Media was granted approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a television channel named Family Extreme. Astral announced it would launch a localized version of Disney XD on June 1, 2011, using the Family Extreme license, in both standard and high definition. In late 2011, Astral also launched a Disney XD video on demand app for the Xbox 360 video game console. In 2012, the channel premiered its first original series, Slugterra. After the Competition Bureau approved Bell Media's takeover of Astral, Bell announced on March 4, 2013 that it would put Disney XD, along with its sister networks and Astral's French-language music networks, up for sale. On October 27, 2013, the channel premiered its first original movie, Bunks, produced by Fresh TV. On November 28, 2013, DHX Media announced that it would acquire Disney XD and its sister networks for $170 million. The acquisition was approved by the CRTC on July 24, 2014, and closed on July 31, 2014. In that same year, Disney XD premiered the pilot for Fangbone!, in May, and a new original series, Gaming Show (In My Parents' Garage), in November. =As Family Chrgd= On April 16, 2015, it was announced that Corus Entertainment had acquired Canadian rights to Disney Channel's program library; alongside the launch of a Canadian version of Disney Channel, Corus stated that it would launch other \\"Disney branded kids linear television offerings\\" in the future. In anticipation for this transition, DHX concurrently announced that its Disney-branded networks would be realigned under the Family brand by November 2015. Tentatively, Disney XD was to be rebranded as Family XTRM. When announcing its slate of programming for the 2015‚Äì16 season on August 20, 2015, DHX revealed the channel's new name would be Family Chrgd. Its lineup was to feature new seasons of the network's existing original series, in addition to new shows produced by DHX subsidiaries and other studios (such as the aforementioned Fangbone!), as well as new program supply agreements with Mattel, and later in the year, DreamWorks Animation. The re-branding to Family Chrgd took place on October 9, 2015.

The pancake and waffle mixes produced out of their Dogpatch facility are made entirely of all-natural, organic ingredients. The company is also a staunch proponent of the American economic recovery movement, working exclusively with domestic farmers and distributors and focusing significantly on job creation for local residents.Radio interview: \\"Dining Around with Gene Burns\\". KGO Newstalk 810, San Francisco. March 7, 2011, Hour 3. History The \\"Pancake Kings of San Francisco\\", Jack Harper (right) and Jason Jervis (left), enjoy a stack of pancakes. Jack & Jason's Pancakes & Waffles started when co-owners Jack Harper and Jason Jervis made the decision to leave their corporate jobs in favor of starting an enterprise of their own. After departing their occupations, the two partners held brainstorming sessions during their daily breakfasts to conceive a suitable idea for their new business venture. Jack and Jason ran through the general market's limited breakfast options quickly, so they began formulating and developing their own pancake and waffle mixes. Bolstered by positive reception from friends and family, the two partners decided to package and sell their homemade mixes in a limited capacity. Several weeks of meticulous testing and refinement led Harper and Jervis to ultimately develop the five distinct flavors that would become their base product line. Starting small with handmade packaging and a customer base built solely upon word of mouth, Harper and Jervis soon encountered growing public demand for their product. Determined to meet the needs of their growing customer base, the two partners designed and implemented a specialized manufacturing line‚Äîwhen the first production batch rolled out, Jack and Jason's Pancakes & Waffles was officially up and running. Currently, the company boasts a growing staff of enthusiastic workers and several wholesale distributors across San Francisco and northern California including Boudin Bakery in Fisherman's Wharf, Mollie Stone's Markets down the Peninsula, New Leaf Community Markets around Santa Cruz, and Nugget Markets in the Sacramento metropolitan area. Jack & Jason's is also branching out to other states; in addition to nationwide online shipping, their products can now be found in Portland, Oregon, Phoenix, Arizona, and Sellersville, Pennsylvania. Products The production line at Jack and Jason's currently makes five distinct flavors of pancake mix with a majority of the ingredients supplied by regional Bay Area businesses.

Early life Randall was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on September 27, 1909. His family moved to Orlando, Florida in 1916. As a youth Randall enjoyed hunting and fishing and went on to become a successful citrus rancher. He first became interested in making knives after he purchased in 1936 a William Scagel knife that was being used to scrape paint off of a boat without showing any signs of wear or damage. Knifemaking Impressed with his Scagel knife, Randall located Scagel and asked him how to make knives. Over the years he visited Scagel and corresponded with him, becoming his \\"pupil\\" with regard to knifemaking. Randall forged his first knife out of a leaf spring from an automobile in his garage in Lake Ivanhoe, Florida with a handle of stag and made his first hunting knife. On his first hunting trip with that knife he sold it to a companion and made another, repeating the pattern of making knives and selling them to friends one at a time. In 1938 Randall opened a shop in Orlando, Florida. Although Randall's initial efforts were inspired by Scagel's designs and were predominantly \\"sporting knives\\" for hunters and fisherman, a visit by a soldier bound for World War II changed that. Randall began production of the \\"All Purpose Fighting Knife\\" giving it the designation of \\"Number 1\\" in his catalog. Between 1942 and 1945, Randall Made Knives produced 4,000 of these knives for US Troops in the war, with approximately 1,058 subcontracted out to Northampton Cutlery Company in Springfield, Massachusetts to meet the demand. In the 1950s Randall would return to the pattern of the Bowie knife for several of his combat knife designs.Pacella (2002)pp. 130-131 Randall designed the Model 17 Astro Model and built 7 of these knives for NASA. In addition to the knife that made 21 orbits around the earth, several of Randall's knives are displayed in the Smithsonian Institution and in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. One Model 8 \\"Trout and Bird Knife\\" was displayed in the Monino Airbase museum near Moscow as part of the equipment carried by U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers who was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960.  Personal life  Randall's wife was Ruth Randall. Randall died in 1989 in Orlando, Florida, at 80 years of age. = Legacy = Randall was inducted into the Blade magazine Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1983 Blade Show as an inauguree. In 1997, Randall was inducted into the American Bladesmith Society Hall of Fame. In 2001, Randall's knives were listed as \\"Best Sheath Knife\\" as part of Forbes \\"50 Best List\\".

The goal was to map up to 50% of the planet's surface down to a resolution of 2 km with the eventual goal of targeting landers and atmospheric probes. A 1978 study evaluated the potential use of synthetic aperture radar to achieve 200 meter resolution. The spacecraft was to be launched from the Space Shuttle using a twin stage IUS in December 1984, and arrive in orbit May 1985. The mission was expected to last until November 1985. By 1981, the plan was for the spacecraft to launch in 1987 and to use aerobraking to circularize its orbit, whereupon it would be able to generate radar coverage of the entire planet over a period of 126 days. Data transmission rates were 1 Mbit per second, matching the imaging and recording speed. It would have two resolutions: mapping mode of 600 m per line-pair, then a high-resolution mode at 150 m per line-pair. The mission was cancelled in 1982 when it exceeded its budget limit. In 1983, it was replaced by a less ambitious mission called the Venus Radar Mapper, which was later renamed Magellan.

AAPF seeks to build bridges between arts, activism, and the academy in order to address structural inequality and systemic oppression. AAPF develops and promotes frameworks and strategies that address a vision of racial justice that embraces the intersections of race, gender, class, and the array of barriers that disempower those who are marginalized in society. Seeking to raise awareness for black female victims of police brutality and anti-Black violence in the United States, AAPF released a report entitled \\"Say Her Name: Resisting Police Brutality against Black Women\\" in July 2015. The report documents stories of Black women who have been killed by police, shining a spotlight on forms of police brutality often experienced disproportionately by women of color. It also provides analytical frameworks for understanding Black women's experiences, and broadens dominant conceptions of who experiences state violence and what it looks like. In February 2015, the African American Policy Forum (AAPF) coined the hashtag #SayHerName in an effort to create a large social media presence alongside existing racial justice campaigns, such as #BlackLivesMatter and #BlackGirlsMatter. Since 2015, #SayHerName has seen global use to call attention to the continued lack of Black women's narratives in discussions of state violence.  History and mission  The African American Policy Forum (AAPF) was co-founded in 1996 by Kimberl√© Williams Crenshaw, Professor of Law at UCLA and Columbia Law School and leading authority in the area of Civil Rights and Black feminist legal theory; and Luke Charles Harris, Professor of Political Science at Vassar College and leading authority in the field of Critical Race Theory. The Policy Forum was developed as part of an ongoing effort to promote women's rights in the context of struggles for racial justice. The African American Policy Forum's mission is to utilize new ideas and innovative perspectives to transform public discourse and policy. The Policy Forum promotes frameworks and strategies that address a vision of racial justice that embraces the intersections of race, gender, class, and the array of barriers that disempower those who are marginalized in society. Bridging art, activism, and academic discourse in their work, AAPF is dedicated to advancing and expanding racial justice, gender equality, and the indivisibility of all human rights, both in the U.S. and internationally.  Initiatives and campaigns  = #WhyWeCantWait = #WhyWeCantWait is an AAPF initiative that was publicly announced on June 17, 2014 with the issuing of an open letter sent to former President Barack Obama, signed by over 1,400 women of color entitled ‚ÄúWhy We Can‚Äôt Wait: Women of Color Urge Inclusion in ‚ÄòMy Brother‚Äôs Keeper.‚Äô‚Äù In this letter, women of color questioned how attempts to address the challenges facing males of color ‚Äì without integrating a comparable focus on the complex lives of girls and women who live and struggle together in the same families, homes, schools, and neighborhoods ‚Äì advances the interests of the community as a whole. The women who signed this letter share a commitment to the expansion of ‚ÄúMy Brother‚Äôs Keeper‚Äù (MBK) and all other national youth interventions to include an explicit focus on the structural conditions that negatively impact all youth of color. In addition to the Why We Can't Wait letter, AAPF also published an open letter on May 30, 2014, signed by ‚Äú250+ Concerned Black Men and Other Men of Color.‚Äù This letter called for the inclusion of women and girls of color in the president's initiative. Signers included writer and activist Darnell Moore, actor Danny Glover, professor Robin D.G. Kelly, and writer and professor Kiese Laymon. Later, on July 10, 2014, AAPF organized a conversation moderated by GRITtv's Laura Flanders on the necessity of expanding ‚ÄúMy Brother‚Äôs Keeper.‚Äù Featured speakers included AAPF co-founder Kimberle Crenshaw, Professor and Co-Founder of The Crunk Feminist Collective Brittney Cooper, Founder and Executive Director of Girls for Gender Equity Joanne Smith, as well as Professors Kristie Dotson and Rosa Linda Fregoso. = #BreakingTheSilence = #BreakingTheSilence refers to a national town hall series launched by the AAPF in 2014. This series entitled ‚ÄúBreaking the Silence: A National Town Hall Series on Women & Girls of Color,‚Äù focuses on elevating the stories and experiences of women and girls of color. AAPF is committed to hosting town hall hearings in order to bring the circumstances facing many women of color out of the shadows and squarely into public policy debates, while helping community leaders develop and advance local agendas for gender inclusive racial justice. Beginning in 2014, AAPF has partnered with local organizations to hold town hall events in New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago, Washington DC, Baltimore, Miami, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Oakland and Greensboro. Following the momentum of the Breaking the Silence Townhall, AAPF established the Breaking the Silence summer camp series during the summer of 2015. Breaking Silence: An Arts, Action, and Healing Summer Camp is an AAPF program that convenes an intergenerational group of women and girls of color from across the country into a space to share stories, uplift spirits, and fight for justice using artistic modes of expression. = #BlackGirlsMatter = #BlackGirlsMatter refers to a social media campaign that intends to catalogue the experiences of black girls in the United States. This campaign was initiated when African American Policy Forum and the Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies at Columbia Law School released a report titled ‚ÄúBlack Girls Matter: Pushed Out, Overpoliced, and Underprotected,‚Äù on February 4, 2015. The report, based on an analysis of Department of Education discipline data for New York City and Boston Public Schools as well as personal interviews with young women from these areas, focused on the specific challenges that girls of color face in schools. The Black Girls Matter report cites several examples of excessive disciplinary actions against young black girls, including the controversial 2014 case of a 12-year-old in Georgia who faced expulsion and criminal charges for writing the word ‚Äúhi‚Äù on a locker room wall. A white female classmate who was also involved faced a much less severe punishment. According to the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Education cited in the report, nationally, black girls were suspended six times more than white girls, while black boys were suspended three times as often as white boys. Data specific to New York and Boston demonstrates that the relative risk for disciplinary action is higher for Black girls when compared to white girls than it is for Black boys when compared to white boys. The report recommends policies and interventions to address challenges facing girls of color, including revising policies that funnel girls into juvenile supervision facilities; developing programs that identify signs of sexual victimization and assist girls in addressing traumatic experiences; advancing programs that support girls who are pregnant, parenting, or otherwise assuming significant familial responsibilities; and improving data collection to better track discipline and achievement by race/ethnicity and gender for all groups. = #SayHerName = The #SayHerName hashtag‚Äîcoined by AAPF in February 2015‚Äîhas come to represent the burgeoning movement to uplift the stories of Black women facing a myriad of systemic issues, including domestic violence, sexual assault by police, and inadequate mental health support. On May 20, 2015, AAPF hosted #SayHerName: A Vigil in Memory of Black Women and Girls Killed by the Police at Union Square in New York City. Family members of Black women killed by police came together from across the country for the first time in a powerful vigil designed to uplift their loved ones' stories. Later on in May 2015, AAPF released a report entitled \\"Say Her Name: Resisting Police Brutality Against Black Women,\\" which outlined the goals and objectives of the #SayHerName movement. The report provides an analytical framework for understanding black women's susceptibility to police brutality and state-sanctioned violence, and also offers some suggestions on how to effectively mobilize various communities and empower them to advocate for racial justice. AAPF has sponsored a variety of events ranging from art showcases to activist actions in relation to #SayHerName. On November 1, 2015, AAPF, One Billion Rising, and Thandie Newton co-hosted a #SayHerName event in Los Angeles, calling on artists and activists in the entertainment industry to #SayHerName. The next year, on November 12, 2016, AAPF held #SayHerName: An Evening of Art and Action at the Nuyorican poet's cafe in New York City. On February 24, 2017, AAPF held another evening of art and action at the Pratt Institute in conjunction with their BlackLivesMatter Teach-In program. = #HerDreamDeferred = In late March to early April 2015, AAPF launched a week-long online series dedicated to elevating the status of Black women entitled #HerDreamDeferred. AAPF co- organized this initiative with The Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, The National Organization for Women, Institute for Women's Policy Research, Black Women's Blueprint, PACE and other racial and gender justice leaders in honor of Women's History Month and the UN Declaration of 2015 as the start of the International Decade for People of African Descent. Each day during the week of March 30 to April 3, 2015, AAPF hosted an online event to highlight a specific set of challenge facing Black women. Topics that were covered included: state-sanctioned violence, economic inequality, sexual assault and domestic violence, school-pushout, health disparities, and the challenges faced by Black women in higher education. The goal of the series was to elevate these challenges so that stakeholders across the country could better understand and address the challenges facing Black women and girls. In 2016, AAPF reconvened the online event series. During the week of March 28 to April 1, AAPF covered topics relating to criminalization of Black girls in and out of school, the war on Black single mothers, the status of Women of Color in the South, sexual assault at HBCUs, and challenges faced by Black women veterans. In 2017, the series was expanded to include events at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles on March 28, 29, and 30th, as well as events at Impact Hub LA in addition to the virtual workshops. Topics included the resistance of Afro-Colombian women at the intersection of racism, sexism, and war, a #SayHerName night of performance curated by Abby Dobson, Latasha Harlins and the victimization of Black girls (moderated by Laura Flanders), representations of Black women in the media (and Hollywood in particular), and Black women and tech activism. Beginning in 2015 as a result of the Her Dream Deferred initiative, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) has entered into the Congressional Record her request that the last week of March be Black Women's History Week, as part of Women's History Month. Coinciding with the annual Her Dream Deferred series, this week would focus on the status of Black women and girls, acknowledging their contributions to the nation as well as addressing the challenges they continue to face. = Researcher‚Äôs collaborative = In May 2015, AAPF, in collaboration with the Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies at Columbia Law School, convened an interdisciplinary group of researchers, service providers and advocates whose work focuses on the intersectional issues impacting women of color. Among the issues surfaced during the convening were the disciplinary and institutional barriers that suppress information sharing among experts; the marginalization of research about women of color within academic and research institutions; the lack of targeted funding for research and data collection on women of color; and the overall lack of a demand for evidence-based programs that might underwrite institutional commitments to women of color. Researchers also addressed the ways that standard reporting practices from government agencies raised unnecessary barriers to developing reliable information about the factors that contribute to poor outcomes for women of color.

Varghese and Rajan P. Dev in supporting roles. The plot follows Ashok Nariman, a Crime Branch DySP who is assigned to re-investigate the \\"couple murder case\\" and then to investigate the \\"Ammini missing case\\". The film was dubbed in Hindi as Farz Ki Pukaar and in Telugu as Senathipathi.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ald3rxOVdo Plot Manu (Vijayakumar), the accused in the notorious couple murder case, attempts an escape during his prison transfer, but ends up shot by the police multiple times. Dr. Giri (N. F. Varghese), a senior surgeon takes pity on the escaped criminal who is to be hanged for his crime. Manu is accused to having murdered his elder brother (Ashokan) and sister-in-law out of lust for the latter, in an attempted rape. For various reasons Dr. Giri believes Manu to be innocent. He convinces his friend Shekharan (Janardhanan), the Chief Minister of Kerala , to re-open the case and assign the case to a sincere and brilliant, yet aggressive police officer Ashok Nariman (Suresh Gopi). Initially termed \\"hopeless\\" by legal advisors‚Äîdue to the excellent way the case was framed, Nariman finds loopholes . He learns that the crime was committed by the intelligent Adv. Padhmanabhan Thampi (Siddique) and his friends Kochunarayanan (Jagathy Sreekumar), SP Philippose (Spadikam George) and their allies including Musthafa Kamal (a.k.a. Karate Kamal) (Bheeman Raghu) -- who executed the crime. Nariman submits the report and the case comes to the Sessions Court. To everyone's disappointment, the Judge refuses to have a second hearing of the case‚Äîas earlier the case had gone up to Supreme Court and even the President of India did not have any pity on the \\"perpetrator\\" Manu. The Judge believes the case to be a publicity stunt as the result of change in Government and the Court cannot be deceived by any. Although disappointed at the happenings, Nariman takes over a new case‚ÄîAmmini missing case. Ammini (Anju) was an ally, a prostitute, a pimp and an outlet for the illegal liquor dealings of Kochunarayanan. Lately, she had a change of mind to turn back from her wrong way of life, to be with her daughter who hated Ammini's activities. This provoked Adv. Thampi, as she knew many of their secrets, even to an extent more than they know of each other. He even had suspicion of her being the reason for the police storming the secret hide-out of Kamal. Nariman reports the four guilty of murder and the case reaches the same Sessions Court. The four were found to be guilty by Court, even with an experienced senior lawyer (Adv. Vaikuntam (Rajan P. Dev)) appearing for them against the inexperienced public prosecutor Adv. Sethulekshmi (Samyuktha Varma), the love interest of Nariman. While the Judge (Kozhikode Narayanan Nair) reads his judgement, Nariman‚Äîto everyone's surprise‚Äîinterrupts the Judge to say the four are innocent. He presents Ammini, the very same Ammini that the Court declared dead. He confesses his act on how the four became 'culprits' and how the case was framed using strong, but fake evidences (as in couple murder case). If an average officer could easily deceive the Court, he exclaims what will happen if an evil genius with a group of powerful allies sets out on a rampage. If the Court, where common people seek justice, fails to stop them, then there would be a state of anarchy where people won't hesitate to act worse. Through his drama, he pleads justice for Manu. Although initially furious with his actions, the Judge realizes that the Court can be deceived at times and allows for a second hearing in Manu's case. Through the proceedings months after, Manu is found innocent by the Court and the guilty quadraplet-Adv. Thampi, Kochunarayanan, Philipose and Kamal-get their punishment.

A supermoon is a full moon or a new moon that nearly coincides with perigee‚Äîthe closest that the Moon comes to the Earth in its elliptic orbit‚Äîresulting in a slightly larger-than-usual apparent size of the lunar disk as viewed from Earth. The technical name is a perigee syzygy (of the Earth‚ÄìMoon‚ÄìSun system) or a full (or new) Moon around perigee. The term supermoon is astrological in origin and has no precise astronomical definition. The real association of the Moon with both oceanic and crustal tides has led to claims that the supermoon phenomenon may be associated with increased risk of events like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, but no such link has been found. The opposite phenomenon, an apogee syzygy or a full (or new) Moon around apogee, has been called a micromoon. Definitions The term supermoon is attributed to astrologer Richard Nolle while reading ‚ÄúStrategic Role Of Perigean Spring Tides in Nautical History and Coastal Flooding‚Äù published in 1976 by NOAA Hydrologist Fergus Wood. In practice, there is no official or even consistent definition of how near perigee the full Moon must occur to receive the supermoon label, and new moons rarely receive a supermoon label. = Nolle = Nolle described the concept in a 1979 edition of Dell Horoscope including both full and new moons, but has never outlined why he chose 90% nor has provided a definitive formula for determining if a given full or new moon is \\"super\\". The basic 1979 definition read: Nolle amended his definition in 2000 specifying the distance of a given full or new moon be judged against 90% of the mean distance of perigees. Nolle (incorrectly) referenced NASA image showing comparison of a supermoon (left) and a micromoon (right) In 2011, Nolle added apogees to consideration explaining that he based calculations on 90% of the difference in lunar apsis extremes for the solar year. EarthSky analyzed Nolle's tables and described the updated definition as a full or new moon is considered a supermoon if ld_s leq ld_p + 0.1 * (ld_a - ld_p) where ld_s is the lunar distance at syzygy, ld_a is the lunar distance at apogee, and ld_p is the lunar distance at perigee. Nolle based those the mean apsis extremes referencing (incorrectly) the Wikipedia article on the subject arriving at: Nolle also added the concept of extreme supermoon in 2000 describing the concept as any new or full moons that are at \\"100% or greater of the mean perigee\\". = Espenak = The term perigee-syzygy or perigee full/new moon is preferred in the scientific community. Perigee is the point at which the Moon is closest in its orbit to the Earth, and syzygy is when the Earth, the Moon and the Sun are aligned, which happens at every full or new moon. Astrophysicist Fred Espenak uses Nolle's definition but preferring the label of full Moon at perigee on full moons occurring \\"within 90% of its closest approach to Earth in a given orbit\\" over Nolle's calculations based on the closest of all orbits during the solar year. Wood used the definition of a full or new moon occurring within 24 hours of perigee and also used the label perigee-syzygy. = Other definitions = Sky and Telescope magazine chose a definition of . TimeandDate.com prefers a definition of . EarthSky uses Nolle's definition comparing their calculations to tables published by Nolle in 2000. Wood also coined the less used term proxigee where perigee and the full or new moon are separated by 10 hours or less. Occurrence Of the possible 12 or 13 full (or new) moons each year, usually three or four may be classified as supermoons, as commonly defined. The most recent full supermoon occurred on May 7, 2020, and the next one will be on March 28, 2021. The one on November 14, 2016 was the closest full supermoon since January 26, 1948, and will not be surpassed until November 25, 2034. The closest full supermoon of the 21st century will occur on December 6, 2052. Supermoons will be the marked points nearest the bottom of the graph. The oscillating nature of the distance to the full or new moon is due to the difference between the synodic and anomalistic months. The period of this oscillation is about 14 synodic months, which is close to 15 anomalistic months. So every 14 lunations there is a Full Moon nearest to perigee. Occasionally, a supermoon coincides with a total lunar eclipse. The most recent occurrence of this was in January 2019 (same moon diameter as the total solar eclipse of December 5, 2048), and the next will be in May 2021 (same moon diameter as the total solar eclipse of July 11, 1991). Appearance The supermoon of March 19, 2011 (right), compared to an average full moon of January 18, 2011 (left), as viewed from Earth A full moon at perigee appears roughly 14% larger in diameter than at apogee. Many observers insist that the moon looks bigger to them. This is likely due to observations shortly after sunset when the moon is near the horizon and the moon illusion is at its most apparent. While the moon's surface luminance remains the same, because it is closer to the earth the illuminance is about 30% brighter than at its farthest point, or apogee. This is due to the inverse square law of light which changes the amount of light received on earth in inverse proportion to the distance from the moon. A supermoon directly overhead could provide up to 0.36 lux.  Effects on Earth  Claims that supermoons can cause natural disasters, and the claim of Nolle that supermoons cause \\"geophysical stress\\", have been refuted by scientists. Despite lack of scientific evidence, there has been media speculation that natural disasters, such as the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, are causally linked with the 1‚Äì2 week period surrounding a supermoon. A large, 7.5 magnitude earthquake centred 15 km north-east of Culverden, New Zealand at 00:03 NZDT on November 14, 2016, also coincided with a supermoon. Tehran earthquake on May 8, 2020, also coincided with a supermoon. Scientists have confirmed that the combined effect of the Sun and Moon on the Earth's oceans, the tide, is greatest when the Moon is either new or full. and that during lunar perigee, the tidal force is somewhat stronger, resulting in perigean spring tides. However, even at its most powerful, this force is still relatively weak, causing tidal differences of inches at most.  Total Lunar Eclipses  Total lunar eclipses which fall on supermoon and micromoon days are relatively rare.

Chemically, DDAIP is an ester of N,N-dimethylalanine and dodecanol. DDAIP is typically formulated as its hydrochloride salt (DDAIP.HCl). This salt is a white crystalline solid with a melting range of 88-93 ¬∞C and is an amphiphilic molecule with a pKa of 4.87 that is soluble in water up to about 40% w/v. DDAIP is proprietary to NexMed USA, a subsidiary of Apricus Biosciences.  Mechanism of action  DDAIP is a permeation enhancer that temporarily changes the permeation dynamics of the lipid bilayer and opens up the tight junctions between skin cells so active drug molecules can be rapidly absorbed through the skin into systemic circulation. It can also improve the solubility of compounds resulting in enhanced drug permeation.  Clinical use  DDAIP hydrochloride is a functional inactive excipient currently used in the topical drug Vitaros, an alprostadil vasodilator cream used to treat erectile dysfunction. It is also used in MycoVa, a terbinafine antifungal nail lacquer for onychomycosis currently in phase-III clinical trials.  Safety  Overall, about 5,000 patients have been exposed to this compound with no serious adverse events recorded. DDAIP is primarily metabolized by esterases on cell surfaces and plasma to N,N-dimethylalanine, which is further demethylated to alanine; and dodecanol which is oxidized to lauric acid, both naturally occurring compounds already present in the body.

He was the 1944 national chairman of Gerald L. K. Smith's Christian Youth for America. Biography Kenneth Goff Fighting Communist Fluoridation According to his biographical material, he was a member of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) from May 2, 1936, to October 9, 1939, when he testified before the Dies Committee. He claimed that while in the CPUSA he infiltrated youth organizations and worked for Communist front organizations, maintaining links with Communist leaders both in the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., in order to lay the groundwork for Communist revolution in the United States. He also claimed that his testimony before the Dies Committee led to the dismissal of 169 federal employees.Kaplan, p. 120 He died at the age of 57 in Chicago in 1972 during a speaking tour.AP Following his appearance before the Dies Committee, Goff made numerous speaking tours and was the author of 28 books, numerous tracts and several periodicals, including from 1962-1967 The Pilgrim Torch. In his 1954 book, Hitler and the Twentieth Century Hoax, which denied the Holocaust, Goff claimed that Hitler was a Communist agent, hinted he was Jewish, and also that Hitler was still alive and would reappear to advance Communism.Kaplan, p. 121Durham, p. 63 He also claimed that both hippies and desegregation were part of a Communist plot.Kaplan, pp. 120-121 He told the Dies Committee that the Communists were in favor of water fluoridation, because they intended to take over water treatment plants and threaten to poison the water supply with fluoride if Americans did not surrender.Hodapp and Von Kannon, p. 49 Goff's main influence on Christian Identity came through his leadership of the Soldiers of the Cross Training Institute, located in Evergreen, Colorado, which trained Christian Identity ministers, including Dan Gayman of the Church of Israel and Thomas Robb, pastor of the Christian Revival Center and National Director of The Knights Party (KKK). The Institute provided courses on Christianity, politics, survivalism and other subjects.Kaplan, pp. 121-122 In his 1970 book, The Hoaxers: Plain Liars, Fancy Liars and Damned Liars, Morris Kominsky claimed that Goff was the author of Brain-Washing, a book that purported to be a condensation of a work by Lavrentiy Beria, the Soviet secret police chief.Komisky, p. 539 Goff has also been attributed with creating the \\"strangled to death quote\\", which he falsely attributed to the CPUSA leader, Gus Hall. The purported quote was: > I dream of the hour when the last congressman is strangled to death on the > guts of the last preacher-and since the Christians seem to love to sing > about the blood, why not give them a little of it? Slit the throats of their > children [and] draw them over the mourners' bench and the pulpit and allow > them to drown in their own blood, and then see whether they enjoy singing > those hymns. The quote is evocative of Denis Diderot, the eighteenth-century philosopher who allegedly wrote, \\"I should like to see ... the last king strangled with the guts of the last priest.\\" The evangelist Jerry Falwell used the false quote as late as 1980.Boller & George, p. 44 In 2011, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police released a 1960 letter from Goff to the anti-Communist writer Pat Walsh, which claimed that Canadian socialist leader Tommy Douglas had been active in Communist circles in the 1930s.

Released in 86 centers, Thandavam had the highest opening-day collection at the box office in the history of Malayalam cinema, although it failed to maintain it further. The film was dubbed into Tamil and released as Erumugam. Plot The story centers on Kasinathan, a pragmatic but playful businessman keen on general welfare of his men, and also running a resort and massage parlour as a side business. Kasinathan is the younger brother of Swaminathan, the heir to Valiyamangalam Malika and the head of erstwhile feudal Midhilapuri. Midhilapuri is an idyllic village prospered through judicious use of agriculture as the path to good life. Kasinathan is powerful in his own right and is tipped to succeed influential politician Menon in Kerala politics. Kasinathan has a secret admirer in the form of a mysterious girl who drops messages and love hints every day. But Kasinathan has still better issues to worry about!. The burning issue of providing drinking water supply to Udayankara colony is time and again sabotaged by Cherpunkal Shankar Das, a wily and unscrupulous politician of crassest morals who is intent on teaching a lesson to the alleged loyalty of the people who continue to support righteous politicians. The reciprocal justice is carried out by Kasinathan who in a strategic move corners Shankar Das in a compromising position with a serial actress and blackmails him to release permission for water supply in the village. Shankar Das is forced to resign from the cabinet. Ensuing celebration is amply enjoyed in a rain dance song by Kasinathan with all and sundry of his devoted satellites including characters Murugan, Vellapulli Mathachan, Tomi, Basheer, Pushpakumaran etc. Kasinathan's secret lover turns out to be Meenakshi the only sister of his good friend Commissioner Rajeevan. The upcoming business man Dasappan Gounder and his henchmen smells an opportunity to market Cola drinks in Midhilapuri and approaches Swaminathan to start a mutually profitable business deal. Swaminathan in his idealist moral sense is staunchly against the endeavour. Disappointed Gounder joins force with Shankar Das and craftily plots death of Swaminathan in a planned operation. The disappearance of Swaminthan moderates Kasinathan to an extent. He decides to don the garb of saviour of Midhilapauri and returns to his Valiyamangalam Malika. In a chance encounter, Kasinathan learns of the cause of death of his elder brother as planned murder perpetrated by Gounder, DYSP and Shankar Das. This unleashes the beast within him and true to his name, Kasinathan trounces on the hapless Gounder and Shankar Das to a vegetative life death end. Dasappan Gounder is lured to a barn and is thrashed to senselessness by Kasinathan. Meanwhile, Shankar Das is on a self-imposed pilgrimage to gather strength for a showdown with Kasinathan. He is eventually caught in the middle of the Kayakalpa treatment at an ashram and goes mad in the end, a just retribution to a life full of sins and debauched deeds. After sorting out the evil issues, Kasinathan is still troubled by the \\"gap\\" and decides to solve this issue once and for all by marrying his sweet heart.

The film was dubbed in Tamil as Kalam. Plot The film begins with Major Rajendran (Suresh Krishna) being killed by the Pakistani terrorists on the Indo-Pakistan border and the war between India and Pakistan begins. The Pakistani Army led by General Jaffer Khan (Mukesh Rishi) sends a battalion to capture a village on the Indian side of the Line of Control. The Indian Army Brigadier Nayar (Captain Raju) sends the Madras Regiment to recapture the village. The Madras Regiment contains Lt.Col Sharath Chandran (Prabhu), Captain Gopinath (Dileep), Major Prabhakar (Saikumar), Captain Kabir (Siddique), Captain Vijayan (Vijayaraghavan), Havildar Kurian (Jagadish), Private Basheer (Kalabhavan Mani), Naik Haneefa, Havildar Prashanthan, Naik Kunjunni (Machan Varghese), Captain Hema (Indraja) and Private Shankar. They recapture the village after a fierce gun battle that kills all of the Pakistani soldiers. Prabhakar and Kunjunni die during the battle. Jaffer Khan is angered by this defeat and plans to capture the entire Madrasi Regiment alive. He calls Colonel Mushtaq Muhammad, an ISI agent in the Indian Army, and pays him 50,000,000 rupees for capturing the Madras Regiment. Mushtaq Muhammad hatches a plan in which all of the Madras Regiment except, Gopinath and Vijayan were captured. Gopi kills Mushtaq, but is captured by the Pakistanis. All the prisoners of war are sent to a Pakistani camp, where they get tortured. They are forced to work like slaves. Kabir, Haneefa, Kurian and Hema (Sharath's love interest) are killed by the Pakistanis. Meanwhile, the notorious Pakistani terrorist leader Mansoor Akthar arrives in the camp. Jaffer Khan's beautiful daughter Serina (Laila) also arrives there. She is about to be raped by Mansoor, but Gopi kills him by dropping a big rock on the terrorist's head. Serina falls in love with Gopi while he decides to use it to save his country. Serina knows Malayalam since Jaffer Khan's father migrated from Malappuram to Pakistan during the Partition. Meanwhile, Captain Vijayan has infiltrated the Pakistani military and gets information that Pakistan is going to use nuclear weapons in the event of a lost war with India. Gopi, with the help of Serina, gains access to the defusing codes of the missile. The climax is a full war between Indian POWs freed by Vijayan and the Pakistani army. Finally, the nuclear bomb is defused by Gopi and the entire Pakistani army is killed. Jaffer Khan is killed by Sharath, who also dies from his injuries. The entire Pakistani camp is blown up and only Gopi, Serina and Vijayan survive. India wins the war and Gopi is given Param Vir Chakra on his return to India. Gopi marries Serina.

The Vulcan 750 was Kawasaki's first cruiser and first V-twin engine, introduced in late 1984 as the 1985 model. Production history Kawasaki introduced the 750 cc class Vulcan worldwide in 1985. Due to tariff restrictions in the United States on bikes over 700 cc imported from Japan, the initial US spec model was limited to 699 cc and called the Kawasaki Vulcan 700. The tariff was lifted in 1986, and all bikes from then until the production run ended in 2006 were 749 cc. The US name was changed to Vulcan 750 to reflect this. Overview The VN750 remained largely unchanged throughout its 22-year production run with only minor adjustments to the components and varying paint schemes. The VN750 was unique in its class by featuring a more reliable shaft drive usually found on larger cruisers. The bike also featured a liquid-cooled DOHC V-twin engine producing 66 horsepower and a flat 47 ft-lbs of torque throughout most of the rpm range, although the engine was underrated and commonly produced 8-10% more than the advertised power in dynomometer testing . The bike was configured to support an upright riding position with a king/queen seat and a factory installed sissy bar.

Background  On 17 May 1914 Essad Pasha Toptani was accused of assisting the Peasant Revolt against William of Wied. He was exiled to Italy on 20 May without trial. In Italy, he was received with honor since both Italian and Austrian representatives played roles in intrigues that surrounded the revolt. Only a week after prince Wilhelm of Wied's departure from Durres on 3 September 1914, another violent revolt arose. The rebels managed to lay siege on Durres, imprison Wied's supporters, to call for Muslim prince and to establish the Senate for Central Albania. Essad Pasha Toptani  The Treaty  Nikola Pa≈°iƒá In autumn 1914 Essad Pasha decided to accept the invitation of the Senate of Central Albania to return and lead them. First he travelled to Ni≈°, Kingdom of Serbia, where he and Serbian prime minister Nikola Pa≈°iƒá signed the secret treaty of Serbian-Albanian alliance on 17 September 1914. The treaty was signed in Banovina building (which has been part of the University of Ni≈° since 1966), which is close to Ni≈° fortress. The treaty had fifteen points which set up Serbian-Albanian political and military institutions and the military alliance of Albania and the Kingdom of Serbia. The treaty envisaged a rail-road to Durres, the financial and military support of the Kingdom of Serbia to Essad Pasha's position as Albanian ruler and it recorded the demarcation by a Serbo-Albanian commission. The treaty allowed Essad Pasha to change some clauses because the treaty would need the agreement of the Albanian National Assembly. This would be possible after Pasha was elected ruler. Serbia contracted to supply a military intervention to protect Pasha's rule and to subsidise his gendarmerie by paying 50,000 dinars per month for Albanian military supplies. Aftermath In October 1914 Essad Pasha returned to Albania. With Italian and Serbian financial backing he established armed forces in Dib√´r and captured the interior of Albania and Dures.

Raphael Abramovitch Rein (1880‚Äì1963), best known as Raphael Abramovitch, was a Russian socialist, a member of the General Jewish Workers' Union in Lithuania, Poland and Russia (Bund), and a leader of the Menshevik wing of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party (RSDRP). Abramovitch emigrated from Soviet Russia in 1920, landing in Berlin, where he was a co-founder of the long-running Menshevik journal Sotsialisticheskii vestnik (The Socialist Courier). After 1940, with the rise of fascism in Europe, he made his way to the United States, where he lived his final years. Biography =Early years= Raphael Abramovich Rein was born in Daugavpils (Dvinsk) in January 1880 (December 1879 old style). As a student at Riga Polytechnic he became involved in revolutionary politics and became a convinced Marxist. =Revolutionary activity= In 1901 he joined the Bund and the RSDRP. After being arrested, he emigrated, and worked with the Bund abroad. When the Bund withdrew from the RSDRP in 1903, Abramovich maintained contact with Menshevik leaders Martov and Fyodor Dan. The Bund and the Mensheviks eventually patched up their differences,The principal bone of contention in 1903 had been that the Bund wanted to be recognised as an autonomous organisation within a federally structured RSDRP and as the sole legitimate representative of the Jewish proletariat. The RSDRP leaders, including Martov, rejected this, whereupon the Bund withdrew. In the subsequent dispute between Lenin and Martov over party membership conditions, Lenin therefore had a majority. Subsequently the Mensheviks accepted the Bund's demand for organisational autonomy, ad the Bund rejoined the Menshevik wing of the RSDRP. and Abramovich became a member of the Menshevik party. He edited the Social-Democratic journals Evreiskii Rabochii (Jewish Workers) and Nashe Slovo (Our Word). In 1904 Abramovich became a member of the Central Committee of the Bund. During the abortive Revolution of 1905, he represented the Bund in the St. Petersburg Soviet. In 1907 he ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for the second Duma. He attended the conferences of the Bund and the RSDRP in 1906 and 1907. In 1911 he was arrested and exiled to Vologda but fled abroad. In 1912-14, he lived in Vienna, working as a correspondent for the Bund newspapers, Leben Frage and Tseit. published legally in Warsaw and St Petersburg. In 1914 he at first sided with the Internationalist wing of the Menshevik party, which opposed the First World War, but he was not as radically anti-war as Martov. After the February Revolution of 1917, Abramovich returned to Russia. He became a member of the Central Committee of the Petrograd Soviet. For a while he became a qualified Revolutionary Defencist, siding with Mensheviks like Dan and Tsereteli against Martov. While Martov's Menshevik Internationalists opposed the war altogether, the Revolutionary Defencists supported a limited war effort in defence of the Revolution. However, they opposed territorial or financial war aims and rejected the unqualified pro-war stance of 'Social Patriots' like the aged Plekhanov and A.N. Potresov. =Russian revolution= After the October Revolution, Abramovich and Dan once more moved to the left and rejoined Martov's faction. Abramovich played a role in unsuccessful attempts to negotiate and all-socialist coalition with the Bolsheviks, comprising Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries of various factions and Popular Socialists. Neither Lenin nor most of the leaders of the other proposed coalition partners had any interest in this idea, though there was popular support for it among workers. The negotiations failed. Abramovich subsequently became more critical of the Bolsheviks. In 1918 he was arrested for anti-Soviet activities and escaped execution due to the intervention of Friedrich Adler and other foreign socialists. At the 12th Bund Congress, he fiercely opposed a proposal by some of those present to amalgamate with the communist party, =Exile= In 1920 Abramovich left Soviet Russia. He settled in Berlin, where he co-founded and co-edited the Menshevik paper Sotsialisticheskii Vestnik (Socialist Courier). In the 1920s he was involved in organising the Vienna-based International Working Union of Socialist Parties, which united non-communist socialist parties that rejected the 'Social Patriot' leadership of the old Second International but refused to join the communist Third International. He was later included in the executive of the Labour and Socialist International.Kowalski, Werner. Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 1940. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 294 Abramovich was also instrumental in maintaining contact between Mensheviks abroad and their comrades in Russia. He helped mobilise Western socialist and labour support for socialists persecuted by the Soviet government, e.g. during the Trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries in 1922 and the Menshevik Trial in 1931. After the rise of Hitler, Abramovich moved to Paris. In 1940, when the Germans invaded France, he fled to the United States. He mainly lived in New York. He was a contributor to the Yiddish Social-Democratic paper Forwerts (Forward). Abramovich wrote his memoirs in Yiddish and an English-language history of the Russian Revolution. He remained heavily involved in the activities of the Menshevik party in exile.

The reservation was officially created on September 15, 1903 by executive order, on a small parcel carved from the ancestral lands of the Yavapai people, encompassing . The acreage had been part of the Fort McDowell Military Reserve, which had been an important outpost during the Apache Wars. The original inhabitants of the reservation were members of the kwevikopaya, or Southeastern Yavapai, who lived in the nearby Mazatzal-Four Peak and Superstition Mountains area. In the 1970s, there was a proposal to build a dam at the confluence of the Verde and Salt Rivers. Due to the negative effects such a dam would have had on the reservation, the community voted not to sell the land for the dam to the federal government. What would have been called the \\"Orme Dam\\" was never built. The reservation celebrates this victory with a rodeo and pow wow each November. After the passage of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, a casino was built on the reservation. In 1992, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation attempted to seize the gaming devices of the casino. This raid took place in conjunction with raids at four other Indian reservations throughout the country. While the raids at the other four reservations went unopposed, members of the Yavapai tribe organized a protest. Using cars, trucks, and large mobile earth moving equipment, they blocked the egress from the property, preventing the trucks from carting off the machines. An agreement was reached between the tribe and Governor Fife Symington allowing the casino to remain in operation. In 2018, the Tribe announced that they would break ground on a new casino on June 29, 2018, at 9 a.m. Construction on the new 166,341-square-foot casino will begin late summer and it is expected to open by spring 2020. The outside communities of Fountain Hills and Rio Verde lie adjacent to the reservation. In addition to Rio Verde and Fountain Hills, the reservation's economy is also closely tied to the nearby cities of Mesa, Scottsdale and Phoenix. Also in the area is the Salt River Indian Reservation of the Pima and Maricopa peoples. The tribe operates its own gas station, a large sand and gravel operation, a farm, and the Fort McDowell Casino. Other operations on the reservation include the Wekopa Resort and Conference Center, the Poco Diablo hotel, the Wekopa Golf Course, and Fort McDowell Adventures. The area now occupied by the reservation was the birthplace of the Native American activist, Carlos Montezuma, who founded the Society of American Indians. Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery The Ba Dah Mod Jo Cemetery is also referred to as the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation Cemetery.

The 2010 gala ultimately raised nearly ¬£1 million, enough to open a new anaesthetic room. History The Comedy Gala was commissioned by Channel 4 Entertainment commissioning editor, Syeda Irtizaali. Promoted by Off the Kerb Productions, it was to be filmed by Open Mike Productions. 14,000 tickets went on sale on 12 February 2010 for the live show at the O2 Arena, scheduled for 30 March 2010. 2,000 more tickets were released on 26 February. With over 25 performers taking part, Channel 4 promoted the show as \\"the biggest live stand up show in United Kingdom history\\", and \\"the comedy event of the year\\". All tickets for the show were sold in advance according to promoters Off the Kerb. The live show was to be opened by Alan Carr, and would feature live stand-up from several comedians, with other artists contributing additional sketches and filmed inserts, in addition to celebrity appearances from the likes of Katie Price and Alex Reid, and Christine Bleakley, as well as musicals performances by Stomp and Bill Bailey. Channel 4 was to screen 2 hours of highlights from the show at 9pm on bank holiday Easter Monday, 5 April 2010. It was announced on 1 April that the Channel 4 broadcast would also feature a special advert break, with Jimmy Carr mocking a selection of willing advertisers. The live-show went ahead, finishing at 11pm. The Channel 4 programme aired on 5 April, running for an extra 30 minutes over the advertised length. There was a hint at the second gala to come, when Jack Dee closed the first show stating \\"we'll see you next year, thank you and goodnight\\". A second gala was duly announced on 10 March 2011.

Omid Djalili was due to appear according to some Channel 4 publicity before the show, although he did not ultimately feature. Christine Bleakley, having appeared in her regular role as presenter of The One Show broadcast live from 7pm, ultimately took part in the show accompanying Fonejacker as a host, although she did not ultimately perform any stand-up. Show elements The majority of the show was live stand-up, although it also included some musical performances and in- character performances. =Running order= Stand-up acts, sketches and other pre-recorded parts were broadcast in the Channel 4 show in the following order (minus hosts): *Stomp *Alan Carr *Jason Manford *Jo Brand *Apology sketches ad-break *Sean Lock *Short film about Great Ormond Street *Special message from Johnny Depp *Kevin Bridges special ad break featuring Jimmy Carr *Patrick Kielty *Special message from The Ricky Gervais Show *First The Kevin Bishop Show television sketch ad-break *Andy Parsons *Mark Watson ad-break *Michael McIntyre *Bill Bailey ad-break *Jack Dee *Shappi Khorsandi *Peep Show television sketch ad-break *Noel Fielding *Gavin & Stacey live sketch *John Bishop *Jack Whitehall *Rich Hall ad-break *Second The Kevin Bishop Show television sketch *Lee Evans as 'The Lee Evans Trio' ad-break *Lee Evans's main act =Hosts and special guests= All the stand-up acts were given 4‚Äì5 minutes to perform, with longer performances from Michael McIntyre and Lee Evans. To gel the stand-up acts and sketches together, the show used several hosts presenting in turn, which split the show into different notional sections; as well as using special guests and in-character acts for other one- off introductions for other acts. Alan Carr and Jack Dee acted as both hosts and stand-up performers, while some other hosts had short 1 minute acts too. Alan Carr was the first host, introducing Jason Manford, Jo Brand, the apology sketches and Sean Lock, before appearing in the short film about the hospital. Jonathan Ross then took over as host, introducing the message from Johnny Depp, then the acts by Kevin Bridges, the special ad-break, Patrick Kielty, and the special sketch by The Ricky Gervais Show. Rob Brydon and Gok Wan then introduced the first Kevin Bishop Show sketch and Andy Parsons, while Brydon then went on to do a short Tom Jones impression before then introducing Mark Watson. Michael McIntyre was introduced by the celebrity couple Katie Price and Alex Reid, while Fonejacker, appearing in character as 'Terry Tibbs' and accompanied by celebrity guest and BBC presenter Christine Bleakley, then introduced Jack Dee's act. Following his own act, Dee went on to introduce Shappi Khorsandi and the Peep Show sketch. Catherine Tate then appeared in character as 'nan' Joannie Taylor from The Catherine Tate Show, to introduce Noel Fielding. The Gavin & Stacy sketch was not announced, while its characters Corden and Jones then introduced John Bishop. David Mitchell then took over as host, introducing Jack Whitehall, Rich Hall and the second Kevin Bishop Show sketch. The hosts themselves were introduced by the voice of Peter Dickson, with the exception of David Mitchell who was introduced by the previous act, John Bishop. Dickson also introduced Bill Bailey and Lee Evans as the only other acts not introduced in person by somebody. For comedic effect, the start of the Gavin & Stacey sketch was not announced at all. =Other live acts= The show opened with a performance by the musical troupe Stomp who make music using plastic and metal bins and barrels, and oil drums. Alan Carr was then revealed to have been in one of their wheelie bins for the entire performance. Tipped out of the bin, he begins the stand-up show with his own act, before acting as host for the first segment. Bill Bailey performed a short stand-up before going on to perform various musical comedy shorts on the keyboard, with additional vocals by Kevin Eldon. James Corden and Ruth Jones appeared in character as Smithy and Nessa from their television sit-com Gavin & Stacey, carrying forward the plot from the final episode by pretending to be visiting London on a day trip from Barry Island. Lost and late, they appear on stage looking for their seats, before realising they're on stage and carrying on in character. In 'The Lee Evans Trio', Lee Evans appears on his own, spotlighted in turn, miming playing three different instruments, drums, double bass and piano. =Pre-recorded sketches= Various performers provided special shorts of their television shows for the Gala. A special message from the animated show The Ricky Gervais Show featured the voices of Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant & Karl Pilkington in a sketch about giving to charity and swimming with dolphins. In the first The Kevin Bishop Show sketch, Bishop appears as 'Rok Wan' alongside Gok Wan as Gok's younger brother, for a make-over. In his second sketch, in a notional More4 programme 'Celebrity Siblings Reunited', Bishop appears as 'Darren Brown', meeting his twin brother Derren Brown on their birthday. In the Peep Show sketch, David Mitchell and Robert Webb perform a sketch in a restaurant about donating to charity. Actors Sir Patrick Stewart and Johnny Depp, singer Rihanna, actor Kyle MacLachlan, celebrity Sharon Osbourne, all appeared during the show to give notional pre-recorded messages of apology for not being able to attend. However, these were all in fact comedy spoofs. Johnny Depp and Rihanna joked that Jonathan Ross was the reason they weren't appearing, Osbourne play-acted that she had been snubbed by Channel 4, while Stewart and MacLachlan sent-up the general idea of celebrities being less than committed to making appearances at charity galas. Pitched by Carr as the 'serious bit' in the mould of Comic Relief type information films inserted between the comedy acts, the short film broadcast early in the show about the Great Ormond Street Hospital featured instead, Alan Carr touring the hospital meeting staff and patients, making various comic gaffes. During the special ad-break featuring Jimmy Carr, Carr appeared either in specially filmed inserts, or in walkover shots, mocking adverts for Gocompare.com, Churchill car insurance, Specsavers, PokerStars.com, Kerry Low Low cheese and Guinness Reception The live show was greeted with average to good reviews, with The Daily Telegraph and the London Evening Standard giving it 4 out of 5 stars, while The Times and The Independent gave it 3 stars. The length of the show and size of the arena were pointed out as detracting points. Michael McIntyre and Lee Evans were universally recognised as being the best acts of the show. Other noted acts were Jack Dee, John Bishop, Rich Hall, Noel Fielding, and a musical routine by Bill Bailey and Kevin Eldon. With McIntyre being closer of the first half, and Evans closing the show, they had both been given longer than the 5 minutes given to most acts, leading to observations that this meant the intervening acts had neither the time to die a death, or heat up the performance beyond being just enjoyable. The inclusion of Katie Price and Alex Reid was questioned; they were roundly booed by the audience. Media outlets picked up on Patrick Kielty and Sean Lock's inclusion of gags about Michael Jackson, who had been planning to stage his farewell concerts at the arena before his shock death nine months previously. The Channel 4 broadcast on 5 April was to be the highlight of the Channel 4 Easter programming, going up against the Guardian's other Easter Monday TV highlight selections of the final ever episode of A Touch of Frost on ITV, and the UK premiere of the long-awaited series The Pacific, on Sky Movies. The broadcast ultimately came third in the terrestrial viewer ratings in its time slot. It registered 2.172 million viewers, a 9.9% audience share, between 9 pm and 11.05 pm, with a further 254,000 viewers watching on the timeshift service, Channel 4 +1. This was behind the 8.338 million viewers (34%) registered by A Touch of Frost, and the 4.321 million (16.1%) who watched MasterChef on BBC One. The Pacific registered 631,000 viewers on the digital-only channel Sky Movies. DVD release An uncut version of the full 3-hour show was released on DVD by Universal Pictures on Monday 26 April 2010.

Sars‚Äô and ‚ÄòM.S. Loran‚Äô in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge Area.‚Äù ResearchGate, Jan. 2006. is a poorly known species of fish discovered in 2004 during a study of bottom ichthyofauna aboard the Norwegian RV G.O. Sars, where four species were identified, including A. jensieni. Taxonomy The shortail skate is a member of the family Rajidae, of which 30 genera and over 180 species are recognized. Amblyrija is the genus name of which 10 species are recognized, including A. doellojuradoi (southern thorny skate), A. frerichsi (thickbody skate), A. robertsi (bigmouth skate), etc. Description Members of the family Rajidae carry uncharacteristically similar body plans. This makes visual identification of these individuals extremely difficult. Detailed visual descriptions of A. jenseni are hard to attain, so the description below may represent several of the family Rajidae and should not necessarily be used to differentiate them. A. jenseni is a medium-sized skate. Its maximum known length is 74.3 cm (29.3 in) for males and 85 cm (33 in) for females. Its coloration is chocolate-brown to gray-brown above with scattered darker spots. Ventral on the body appears a patchy white and brown mixture, except for the pelvic fin lobes and tail, which are darker. These white patches are on the snout, upper abdomen, nostrils, mouth gill slits, and anal opening. Its underside is smooth and its dorsal surface is densely covered with prickly scales. Two or three pairs of distinctive scapular thorns are on each shoulder, usually arranged in a triangle, and a row of 24-29 median thorns occur along the back, flanked by a row of smaller lateral thorns on the tail. The tail of the shorttail skate is relatively short. Sexual dimorphism in shorttail skates is present in pelvic fin structure that the males modify to act as copulatory claspers, as well as alternate disc lengths, horizontal diameter of the orbit, height of the tail at the pelvic fin tips, length of the third gill slit, and distances from the center of the anus to the first and second dorsal fins. Distribution and habitat This species of skate is believed to only be found in the North Atlantic, off the coasts of New England, Nova Scotia, Grand Banks of Newfoundland, Iceland, Ireland, Canada, and along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at depths of 167 to 2,548 m (548 to 8,360 ft), making it one of the deepest-occurring skates known. Biology and ecology Skates represent a critical consumer of invertebrates and small fish, representing a similar role as apex predators of the ecosystem. Little is documented about their feeding behavior, but like other of its family, it presumably would eat various cephalopods, crustaceans, and small bony fish such as rattails and teleost fishers. A. jenseni is presumed to be oviparous like other skates. but no observed reproduction cycles have been reported.

Since March, Norway had been feeling significant industrial tension as the full effects of the Great Depression began to be felt in Norway. It was in this atmosphere that the Norwegian Employers' Confederation (NAF) announced a pay cut of 15 and 20 percent. When the Workers' National Trade Union rejected this suggest and counter-proposed a reduction of working hours, the NAF responded with a programme of lockouts. During the lockouts, two companies, Norsk Hydro and Norske Skog Union, chose to allow some contract workers to perform some work. This was perceived as strikebreaking and led to an escalation of the conflict level. It was an angry mood in which the Secretary of the Labor party (and later Prime Minister) Einar Gerhardsen called strikebreakers \\"skabbdyr\\" (scabs) and director of Norsk Hydro Bjarne Eriksen described the dispute as being one between Labour and the community. In the afternoon of 8 June 2,000 workers marched to the Norsk Hydro trans-shipment port and warehouse at Menstad, where 100 police officers guarded the contract workers. The brief \\"battle\\", between police and strikers, saw law-and-order forces overwhelmed by demonstrators, who threw stones and iron piping before the protesters retreated. The government response (passed on by Minister of Defence, Vidkun Quisling) was to send the army into the province with the stated aim of protecting nearby weapons depots. Although there was no further incident and law and order in the area was duly restored, the government response was heavily criticised by the Communist party, who had led the original demonstrations.

Vassall played international rugby for England in the early years of the sport, winning five caps and scoring a hat-trick of tries in the first encounter between England and Wales. While at Oxford University Vassall led the university rugby side to 70 matches without defeat during his three-year captaincy. His belief that the forward players should work in unison with their backs was revolutionary to the game of rugby and changed the way that rugby was played at club and country level. He is recognised as one of the most important figures in the early development of the sport. Early life Vassall was born in Barwick in Elmet, a township in the Tadcaster district of Yorkshire, in 1860, the son of William Vassall and his wife Martha Ann. His father was a rector originally from Great Wigston in Leicestershire, his mother a native of Leeds, who was fifteen years her husband's junior. Just after Harry (named Henry) was born, his family, including his two older siblings William and Margaret, moved to Hardington Mandeville in Somerset where his father took up the post of rector of the parish.Class: RG9; Piece: 1639; Folio: 40; Page: 1; GSU roll: 542844, 1861 England Census, Census Returns of England and Wales, 1861. Kew, Surrey, England: The National Archives of the UK: Public Record Office (PRO), 1861. Henry's mother had been just nineteen when his eldest brother William was born in 1858, and Margaret and Henry had followed in successive years. After moving to Hardington, Henry's family continued to grow at a prodigious rate and between 1861 and 1882 Henry gained a further twelve siblings, the last of which was Leonard born in 1882 when Martha was forty-two. This was the year before Henry's father's death in 1883. Henry was educated at Marlborough College before matriculating to Hertford College, Oxford in 1879. Rugby career Cover of Vassall's book, Rugby Football, 1914 edition Vassall had played rugby during his college days at Marlborough, a school only second to Rugby in its impact on the emergence of rugby. He continued playing at Oxford, and he was part of the Oxford University team in the 1879 Varsity Match, gaining his first sporting 'Blue'. Vassall played in the 1880 Varsity Match and the same season was made the team's honorary secretary.Marshall (1951) p.34 As secretary he brought to the University team a level of organisation that had previously not existed. He ensured the college games were properly organised and set up trials to ensure the best players were chosen. In the 1881 season a match was arranged between England and Wales, the very first international match for the Welsh. A space was left in the England team in the pack for an Oxford University player, which was given to Vassall.Marshall (1951) p.35 Wales were completely unprepared, and the team was constructed to appease regional sides, the result was an 8‚Äì0 defeat (82‚Äì0 by modern standards).

Grant ordered an assault by XV Corpson the Confederate heights at Vicksburg, Mississippi. The 2nd Division was to lead the assault. The plan called for a diversionary storming party of volunteers to build a bridge across a moat and plant scaling ladders against the enemy embankment in advance of the main attack. The Division Commander, MGEN Blair called for volunteers for the party. The volunteers knew the odds were against survival and the mission was called, in nineteenth century vernacular, a \\"forlorn hope\\". They were promised sixty days furlough if they survived. Each brigade (there were three) had a quota of two officers and fifty men. Only single men were accepted as volunteers and even then, twice as many men as needed came forward and were turned away. In the 113th Illinois, the five companies had a quota of three man each. In Company B, as JJ Kellogg related in his war memoir: > Finally there was a movement. Old Joe Smith, white headed, rough visaged and > grizzled by the storms of a half century, stepped to the front and calling > back to his bunkmate said, \\"Come on, Lish,\\" and Elisha Johns filed out by > his side.

The assault began in the early morning following a naval bombardment. The Union soldiers came under enemy fire immediately and were pinned down in the ditch they were to cross. Despite repeated attacks by the main Union body, the men of the forlorn hope were unable to retreat until nightfall . Of the 150 men in the storming party, nearly half were killed.

Built in 1862. the twin spires of the St. James' Church dominates Kolkata's skyline. It is popularly known as Jora Girja (Bengali:‡¶ú‡ßã‡¶°‡¶º‡¶æ ‡¶ó‡¶ø‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ú‡¶æ), literally meaning twin church for its twin spires. History The present church was built to replace an older one of the same name which was situated in Nebutolla Lane, near Amherst Street. This earlier church, built very much after the style and plan of St. Thomas‚Äô Church, Free School Street, was consecrated by Bishop Reginald Heber on 12 November 1829. It appears to have fallen into a state of disrepair, due chiefly to white ants having eaten into the beams, and was declared unsafe for divine worship. An attempt was made to repair the building, but while the work was in progress, the roof fell in during the early hours of the morning of 23 August 1859, leaving the church in ruins. It was decided to abandon any further attempts to repair the Church as it was found to be very much out of the way, and in many ways inconvenient for those attending it. The church authorities, therefore, resolved to build a new church in a more convenient locality and, in conjunction with it, a school for the children of the neighbourhood. Prominent vicars of this church in the past include the late Fr Basil Manuel and the Rt Revd Dr John Perumbalath, currently Bishop of Bradwell in the Church of England. Architecture The project for building the new church and school had the full support and backing of Archdeacon Pratt, a keen educationist, who, with his influence, was able to acquire the garden house of Mr. Coates together with its spacious grounds for the purpose. At the same time, a smaller house on the grounds was also acquired for the residence of the Chaplain. This property was situated opposite the Female European Orphan Asylum, across the road, which had been founded during July 1815 by Mrs. Thompson, the wife of the Rev. T Thompson. The foundation stone of the new Church was laid on 7 June 1862, by the Honorable John Peter Grant, acting Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, at the south-east corner of the foundations. A marble tablet placed on the eastern wall of the south transept reads ‚Äì > The first stone of this Church dedicated to St. James, was laid June 7th, > 1862.

Career Marc Lewis received his Ph.D. in applied psychology at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto in 1989. He was supervised by Robbie Case and can trace his academic lineage back to Jean Piaget through Case's mentor Juan Pascual Leone. From this neo-Piagetian origin, Marc Lewis began investigating cognition-emotion interactions: the influence of cognitive development on emotional and personality development, and the influence of emotion on cognitive and personality development, as a professor at the University of Toronto. This early theory and research led Lewis to incorporate the dynamic systems approaches to development that were emerging in the early 1990s.Lewis, M. D. (2000). \\"The promise of dynamic systems approaches for an integrated account of human development\\". Child Development, 71, 36-43. Following the work of Esther Thelen, Paul van Geert, Alan Fogel, and others, Lewis developed an integrated account of development as self-organization at multiple time scales to explain both the stability and change of emotional aspects of personality.Lewis, M. D., & Liu, Z. (2011). \\"Three time scales of neural self-organization underlying basic and nonbasic emotions\\". Emotion Review, 3, 416‚Äì423. Through a sabbatical at the University of Oregon in 2000-2001, Lewis took the next step in developing his integrated model by delving into the neural underpinnings of emotion regulation.*Lewis, M. D., & Stieben, J. (2004). \\"Emotion regulation in the brain: Conceptual issues and directions for developmental research\\". Child Development, 75, 371-376. His research program over the next decade tested this model by examining brain and behaviour in normal and clinically referred children and assessing neural changes corresponding with developmental milestones, normal changes in identity and personality, and treatment outcomes for children with emotional difficulties.Lewis, M. D., Granic, I., Lamm, C., Zelazo, P. D., Stieben, J., Todd, R. M., Moadab, I., & Pepler, D. (2008). \\"Changes in the neural bases of emotion regulation associated with clinical improvement in children with behavior problems\\". Development and Psychopathology, 20, 913-939. His papers on the contribution of dynamic systems theory and affective neuroscience to understanding human development and clinical syndromes have appeared in journals such as Child Development, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, New England Journal of Medicine, and Perspectives on Psychological Science. He has also co-authored two books with his wife, Dr. Isabela Granic. The first is an edited volume of dynamic systems approaches to emotional development.Lewis, M. D., & Granic, I. (Eds.) (2000). Emotion, development, and self-organization: Dynamic systems approaches to emotional development. New York: Cambridge University Press. The second is a guide for parents about when to attempt sleep training with toddlers. Lewis began his focus on addiction in 2009. His first book on addiction, Memoirs of an Addicted Brain (2011),Lewis, M.D. (2011) Memoirs of an Addicted Brain. Toronto: Doubleday Canada. connects his own years of drug use with an account of how the brain changes with various drugs and with addiction itself. In the second, The Biology of Desire: Why Addiction is Not a Disease (2015), biographies of addicts are linked with neuropsychological findings to show how addiction develops and how it can be overcome. Both books have been published in several languages, and Biology received the PROSE (Association of American Publishers) award for Psychology in 2016. Lewis currently writes for the popular press, maintains an active blog, sees online clients for consultation and psychotherapy, and speaks internationally on the science, experience, and treatment of addiction  Theoretical Model of Emotional Development  Lewis' theory of emotional development relates multiple time scales using characteristics of self-organizing dynamic systems as causal mechanisms.Lewis, M. D. (1996). \\"Self-organising cognitive appraisals\\". Cognition and Emotion, 10, 1-25. This theoretical model relates the moment-to-moment emotional experiences in real time to the moods that persist for longer stretches at a middle or meso-time scale. These events consolidate through the strengthening or pruning of brain connections to become the habits and tendencies of personality at a developmental time scale of years. A further extension of this model incorporated the evolutionary time scale in an attempt to resolve the dispute about whether basic emotions are \\"natural kinds\\".Barrett, L. F. (2006). \\"Emotions as natural kinds?\\". Perspectives on Psychological Science, 1, 28-58.  Theoretical Model of Addiction  Lewis' contends that addiction is not a disease, but rather a habit that self-perpetuates relatively quickly when people repeatedly pursue the same highly attractive goal. Addictive patterns grow quickly and become more entrenched because of the intensity of the attraction that motivates them, the layered symbolic value they acquire, and the loss of a sense of personal (day-to-day) continuity and self-control over time. These psychological changes are mediated by changes in dopamine circuitry and prefrontal mechanisms of perspective-taking, self-concept and inhibitory control, accompanied by a narrowing of the relevant social world. Often, emotional turmoil during childhood or adolescence initiates the belief that addictive rewards are the only reliable sources of relief and comfort. Addiction is a neurally-entrenched phase of personality development, but neural plasticity allows for continuing growth and future wellbeing.  Bibliography  ;Books *Lewis, M. (2015).

The film is about a beautiful and successful forty-year-old businesswoman who receives a letter that she wrote to herself when she was seven years old to remind her of the promises she made at that age, which is considered to be the age of reason in the Catholic tradition, and to remind her of what she wants to become. Plot Margaret is a beautiful and successful businesswoman selling power plants to the Chinese. With an adoring English lover, she appears to have everything going for her. On her fortieth birthday, Margaret receives the first bundle of letters she wrote to herself when she was seven years old. A jumble of colourful collages, photographs, and wildly creative puzzles seem to have come from a different girl entirely. In a letter the seven-year-old Margaret writes, \\"Dear me. Today I am seven years old and I'm writing you this letter to help you remember the promises I made when I was 7, and also to remind you of what I want to become...\\" As her letters to herself keep arriving, Margaret finds herself becoming disenchanted.

Biography =Early life= In 1946 moved Karel's parents, who were farmers, a farm on 3.5 hectares of land in Arendonk, (Belgium), where Karel Meulemans, to this day lives. His first steps in the sport at age 12, he under the impetus his uncle Jan Bols. He was initially successful, with the exception of some nice results were obtained with pigeons by Adriaan Wouters. In 1961, Karel finally visited with his father, the lofts of Jos van den Bosch in Berlaar (Belgium) where 5 pigeons were purchased. These birds would provide the basis for the breed Meulemans, together with a hen of Adriaan Wouters in 1969 was introduced in the formation of the duo-Wouters Meulemans. =Wouters- Meulemans= Golden Couple The main couple \\"Oude van den Bosch x Blue Janssen\\" was a host of top pigeons bred like Merckx, Junior, Kadet, Piet, Witneus, Schoon Donker, Liebling, Prins, Madelon and Benjamin. These pigeons were not only on the basis of the success of the Meulemans pigeons themselves, but also performed excellently in the lofts of many other seekers like Gommaire Verbruggen, Raymund Hermes, Willy Van Berendonck, William Geerts, Frans Moris, Stan Van Beemen, Horst Hackemer, Saville Penkin, Albert Babington, George Litherland Wain Lea Lofts, John Kirk of Warrington, Herman Beverdam, Spencer Jackson of Timbarra Lofts UK, etc. Numerous victories and have won national and international Olympiad pigeons to breed Meulemans achieved. The peak years reached the Wouters-Meulemans team in 1973 and 1974 when prizes were 32 1st and won 180 prizes in the top 10. In 1975, however, came with the death of Adriaan Wouters an end to the cooperation. The Wouters-Meulemans pigeons collection semi-total sold. =Meulemans-Mari√´n= In 1976 however a new team formed between Karel and Adrian Wouter's son, Frans Mari√´n. Again took Karels, who had his hands full on his farm for the breeding of pigeons, while Frans was the playing member of the team. Between 1976 and 1980 earned the Marien- Meulemans successes as a team with that of the former Wouters-Meulemans team at least equaled. The dominance of Frans Marien and Karel Meulemans was such that in the Zuiderkempen in 1978 were excluded in the middle distance races. Besides the descendants of the so-called Golden Couple \\"Oude Van den Bosch x Blue Janssen\\" also brought the descendants of a new super breeding pair \\"Blue Saelen x Oude Bourgeske\\" excellent results. Frans Marien's method of play hard, sometimes up to 2/3 of the race pigeons lost during the season, made it to growing resentment among \\"breeder\\" Karel Meulemans. He was, however, do not have the time to end the cooperation. In April 1980 Frans Marien committed suicide for reasons still unclear. By a clause in the cooperation contract, all the racing and breeding pigeons want to be sold with 20 pigeons in a way, where Karles had to pay as much for the 20 pigeons he kept than their encores in the auction had raised. For his precious collection of breeding pigeons in part to save Karel Meulemans was thus a financial drain to undergo, which gave him for an aversion to playing in team with other fans. =Meulemans-Damen= From 1981 Karel was therefore had to collaborate with his daughter and son in law. Despite the fact that the new Meulemans-Dame duo could offer a nice loft breeders took until 1984 before a first prize √âtampes of the comeback Meulemans pigeons announced. That same year they became Champion Middle Distance Yearlings in Arendonk. The success was short lived. In 1985, 21 racing pigeons stolen from the loft, including 2 of the 4 pigeons that had helped win the championship. The heaviest blow cashed the loft Meulemans But the following year, when thieves, despite an alarm system, to get started with 29 top pigeons, including the legendary \\"Kadet\\". Between 1986 and 1989, Karel Meulemans not be anything other than breeding and again trying to build loft. He then right away took the opportunity to switch on long distance. These distances were actually always formed Karel's passion, but his former teammates Adriaan Wouters Frans Marien and never had to know something of the game at long distances. =the 90's= The Meulemans pigeons from the old line were now supplemented with pigeons from Karel Schellekens, Marien Pieterse, Georges Bolle and Van Gils. This \\"new\\" places Karel Meulemans pigeons early 90s back on the map with victories including Bourges, Montargis, Melun, Argenton and Limoges. A pigeon exchanges Leo Broeckx also showed a bull's eye. The Broeckx pigeons Karel had was the father of his pigeon Olympiad in Bazel in 1997. Broeckx 'pigeon was in turn to Karels's father loft \\"Jonge Kadet\\", 1st Limoges, Brive 1st and 2nd Chateauroux. Pigeons \\"Kadetje 2\\" (1st Bourges, 1st Argenton and 7th National Argenton) and \\"Den Brave\\" (first Narbonne, 1st Montauban and 1st Chateauroux) were the new superstars of the loft Meulemans. In 1995 put \\"Donkere Dax\\" the icing on the cake with a National win in Dax. Beautiful results from Brive and Cahors provided \\"Donkere Dax\\" the 8th National Ace Long Distance title. In 1996 a new golden trio born that Karel would be reminiscent of the happy years with Merckx, Junior and Kadet. \\"Pantani\\", \\"590\\" and \\"591\\" triumphed as the top long distance at Brive and Marseille. Their spectacular results gave Karel the highlight of his career. In 1999 he won the National Long Distance Championship. Karel Meulemans, the \\"Master Breeder\\" had finally proved that he is thus a \\"master player\\". =from 1999= Pigeonlofts January 2011 Such a result is of course even repeating for a great champion is not easy. Since 1999, however, express the Meulemans pigeons regularly made their mark on the distance events.

It is 700 yards west of Mulfra Hill in Penwith District, 3 miles northwest of Penzance and 1.5 miles southwest of Porthmeor, on the high ground of the watershed between the Atlantic and the English Channel. Today the settlement is barely more than a farm within the boundary of the village of New Mill, just north of Boskednan. History Professor Tim Darvill dates Bodrifty as far back as the seventh century BC, but James Dyer has claimed that Bodrifty began as an open settlement in the fourth century BC. During the Iron Age, Bodrifty was inhabited by peasants who lived in round huts and cultivated small fields in the area. The settlement thrived between the fifth and second centuries BC, and Pytheas, the Greek geographer and explorer, is said to have visited Bodrifty on his travels in the 320s BC. Archaeology Hut circle at Bodrifty The site is archaeologically significant in part because of the wide range of pottery shards discovered there. It was excavated extensively in the early 1950s and most of the finds are in the Royal Cornwall Museum, Truro. An analysis of the styles of pottery suggests that Bodrifty was inhabited from the fifth century BC to the first or second century AD. The settlement consisted of eight structures surrounded by a stone wall enclosing about three acres. The structures themselves had internal diameters of between three and eight metres. It is possible that the name means \\"the house by the summer shed\\" in Cornish. =Replica roundhouse= In 1999 Fred Mustill, a local smallholder, built a reconstruction of a roundhouse at Bodrifty Farm after receiving a small grant. The task of building the replica required the shifting of granite rocks weighing several tons, felling, shaping and lashing hundreds of feet of timber, and hundreds of hours' work cutting reeds for the roof. Mustill had previously researched typical roundhouse architectural structure and surveyed other reconstructions in Cornwall. Traditional rab (granite sub soil) was used for the mortar and woods such as oak, ash, holly and hazel for the roof. Mustill was keen for the house to be showcased as an educational aid for local children and others interested in history and archaeology, and hoped it would become a registered charity, though as of August 2011 it was being used for \\"luxury camping\\".

It was originally called Cedar Grove. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is currently a private residence. History =Antebellum= Edward Blackshear moved to the area circa 1822 from what was then Pulaski County, Georgia. Edward was the brother of General David Blackshear, the namesake of Lake Blackshear and the town of Blackshear, Georgia. Edward died September 3, 1829 and his land passed to his wife and five children. The largest block was bequeathed jointly to his sons James Joseph and Thomas Edward. These two continued to acquire land and ultimately amassed approximately . Cedar Grove, circa 1880, from the archives of the Thomas County Museum of History Circa 1841, James Joseph commissioned the architect John Wind to design a plantation house. This photograph, although probably taken after the American Civil War, depicts the structure as originally built. John Wind was born in Bristol, England, in 1819. He was also the architect for the Greenwood, Fair Oaks, Oak Lawn, Pebble Hill and Eudora Plantations, and the Thomas County Courthouse. William Warren Rogers writes \\"Some of Wind's work still exists and reveals him as one of the South's most talented but, unfortunately, least known architects.\\" James Joseph Blackshear was killed in a cotton press accident on November 3, 1843 before the house was completed. His wife, Harriet Blackshear, completed the house and continued to acquire land. His will was not probated until 1857 and her new acquisitions were recorded in his name. Harriet became a prominent planter in her own right. In 1860, thirteen Thomas County plantations produced over 100 bales of cotton. Harriet Blackshear had the record with 235 bales produced by slave workers. She was also one of the county's larger rice producers and she raised 5000 bushels of sweet potatoes. Food crops were also required to feed not only her family, but the slaves who worked the land. The 1840 census recorded 43 male and 59 female slaves. When James Joseph's will was probated in 1857, it listed 161 slaves by name. Harriet Blackshear died in 1863. After the American Civil War, Cedar Grove fell onto hard times, but it remained in Blackshear hands until 1887. =Postbellum= In the 1880s and 1890s, Thomasville was a popular wintering area for wealthy Northern industrialists who came by scheduled rail and private rail cars to hunt and enjoy the pine-scented air. The old and then unproductive plantations were soon discovered and by 1890, all of the 70 plantations in the Thomasville area had been acquired for use primarily as private hunting preserves and retreats. In 1887, Cedar Grove was acquired by Dr. John Metcalfe of New York who used it as a hunting lodge. He renamed Cedar Grove to Susina. Dr. Metcalfe had a wife named Susan and wild plum grew on the property. Susina is Italian for plum. In 1891, A. Heywood Mason of Philadelphia purchased Susina Plantation and approximately 6400 acres (2590 ha). He had inherited a fortune made by his father James S. Mason who developed and sold shoe polish, called shoe blackening at the time. He added side porches to the house and probably the rear kitchen wing. He later expanded the dining room by enclosing a portion of the south porch. The community around Susina was initially called Duncanville. Maps dated from 1887 until 1906 show the town as Susina. After 1906, the area become known as Beachton. Originally located in Thomas County, Susina Plantation is now located in Grady County which was formed out of Thomas and Decatur Counties in 1905. A. Heywood Mason died in 1911 and the plantation was managed by his wife, Anna. After her death in 1931, A. Heywood Mason's son, James Mason II, managed Susina Plantation. His sister, Elanor Mason Butler and her husband expanded the nearby cottage to circa 1925. In 1951, the land at Susina was divided among four heirs. One grandson of A. Heywood Mason, A. Heywood (Hey) Mason II, bought the interests of his brother and two sisters in the main house and the immediate dependencies. A. Heywood Mason II conducted repairs and renovations in 1951 and 1967. Susina Plantation was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 12, 1970. =Modern= In 1980, Susina Plantation was acquired by Anne Marie Walker and was operated as a bed and breakfast. Notable guests were Paul Newman and his wife Joanne Woodward, a Thomasville native. In 2000, Randall and Marilynn Rhea of Atlanta acquired the property for use as their private residence, and they hired general contractor Terrell Singletary of Thomasville to repair and renovate the main house and four of the dependencies. More recently, Susina Plantation has hosted events for the Grady County Historical Society, the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Thomas County Museum of History. The main house at Susina Plantation is considered by some to be one of the finest examples of the Greek Revival style. It was selected for the cover image of two books covering antebellum houses. Architecture The main house sits on a knoll surrounded by large and mature live oak and magnolia lawns. John Wind's early work, such as Greenwood and Susina, were in traditional Greek Revival style. Later at Eudora and Fair Oaks, he skillfully added his own style which tended toward a later romantic or Oriental period. Susina's Ionic portico is supported by four two-story, fluted and tapered round columns. The portico extends across approximately three-fourths of the facade. The house was constructed from heart-pine cut on the property. The siding is clapboard except under the portico where the siding is set flush to resemble stone. The entablature runs completely around the house. The frieze of the portico is plain with large dentils under the cornice. The dentils are continued around the projecting cornice of the pediment. A sunflower rosette, perhaps hand carved by Wind, is in the center of the pediment. A cantilever balcony is under the portico, over the front door. The front double door is eight by seven feet and has sidelights and a fixed transom with lattice work created by strips of wood. The molding around the door has a fret design at the upper and lower corners with fluting running the length of the posts. The door to the balcony is a seven by seven foot version of the main door. The first and second level windows have nine over nine lights and triangular pediments. The windows are six feet six inches high by two feet ten inches wide. The plan is a basic four over four room layout with a central enclosed breezeway. In the original 1841 house, the rooms on the north (right) side of the house were not as deep as on the south, so the rear included a covered porch. A symmetric, circular staircase ascended from the north side of the breezeway to the left side of the top hallway. A room was formed on the second level behind the circular stairwell. The stairwell includes a small, decorative niche. Each room includes a fireplace that extends into the room approximately three feet. Mantels are supported by pilasters of varying design. The interior uses wainscoting throughout with top projecting molding serving as a dado. Door and window moldings are fluted with lintel sections. Simple crown molding completes a relatively simple but elegant woodwork style. Circa 1891, A. Heywood Mason added porches that extend the full length of the house on both the north and south sides. The architect is unknown. Mason also probably added the rear kitchen wing. No photographs prior to 1895 of the rear of the house are known, so dates of renovations at the rear are in question. Between 1891 and 1930, the 1841 rear porch was enclosed to form new rooms on both levels. A south rear screened sleeping room above the side porch was added circa 1925. This sleeping porch and a rear race for air conditioning were removed by the Rhea's in 2000 to return the exterior to an earlier period. References Resources * James S.

Philip Sherard (17 November 1623 ‚Äì 1695) was an English soldier, landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1660 to 1685. Early life Sherard was born on 17 November 1623 as the younger son of William Sherard, 1st Baron Sherard (1588‚Äì1640) and his wife Abigail Cave (1593‚Äì1659).Visitation of the County of Rutland His older brother was Bennet Sherard, 2nd Baron Sherard, who sat as MP for Leicestershire and served as Lord Lieutenant of Rutland. His nephew was Bennet Sherard, 1st Earl of Harborough. His mother, the widow of Henry Tresham (with whom she had several sons), was a daughter of Cecil Cave and Anne (n√©e Bennett) Cave. He was a student at St John's College, Oxford in 1639, and travelled abroad in Italy in 1641. Career Sherard went abroad with his brother shortly before the Civil War, where he became a captain in the Dutch army. He enjoyed field sports and settled at the family estate of Whissendine, Rutland, holding no local office until the Restoration. In 1660, Sherard was elected Member of Parliament for Rutland in the Convention Parliament. He was one of those proposed as Knight of the Royal Oak, and his estate had a yearly income of ¬£600. In 1661, he was re-elected MP for Rutland in the Cavalier parliament, probably without a contest. He was re-elected in the two elections for the First and Second Exclusion Parliaments and again in 1681. In 1682, he was removed from local office, and took no further part in politics, his son Bennet replacing him as knight of the shire in the Convention. Personal life In 1645, Sherard was married to Margaret Eure, widow of both John Pulteney of Misterton, Leicestershire and a Cavalier Col. Hon. William Eure of Old Malton (son of Lord Eure), and daughter of Sir Thomas Denton of Hillesden, Buckinghamshire. Margaret converted to Protestantism. Together, they were the parents of three sons and one daughter, including: * Bennet Sherard (1649‚Äì1701), who was also MP for Rutland. * Philip Sherard, who married and had issue. * Denton Sherard. * Abigail Sherard (b. 1652), who married John Pickering, Esq. (1654‚Äì1703) and had issue. Sherard died at the age of 71 and was buried at Whissendine on 4 March 1695. =Descendants= Through his son Bennet, he was a grandfather of Philip Sherard, 2nd Earl of Harborough (‚Äì1750), who inherited the Harborough earldom through special remainder, and Margaret Sherard, the wife of The Most Rev.

It followed the Fringe team's investigation into a woman, Dana Gray (Paula Malcomson), who repeatedly but unsuccessfully tries to commit suicide. Meanwhile, Olivia continues to serve as the host for William Bell, to the dismay of most of her other team members. The episode's story was written by Akiva Goldsman, Jeff Pinkner, and J. H. Wyman, while Danielle Dispaltro contributed its teleplay. Charles Beeson served as the director. Along with Malcomson, \\"Stowaway\\" featured a guest appearance by previous Fringe actor Seth Gabel. Though Leonard Nimoy had recently retired, the writers still had storylines involving his character, leading to their decision to have Bell possess Olivia's body. \\"Stowaway\\" first aired in the United States on March 18, 2011 to an estimated 3.8 million viewers and a 1.3 ratings share for adults aged between 18 and 49. This was the series' lowest ratings share for adults up to that point. Reviews of the episode were generally positive, as multiple critics praised Anna Torv's Nimoy impression as well as Joshua Jackson's reaction to it. Plot Following from \\"Os\\", Olivia's (Anna Torv) body has been possessed by William Bell. Though he promises that no harm will come to Olivia while he seeks a suitable host for his mind, Broyles (Lance Reddick) demands that Bell leave Olivia in 48 hours. Bell begins searching local hospitals for a host. They are alerted to eyewitness accounts of a woman who, after jumping with another man from a high roof and crashing onto a taxi parked below, simply walked away. As the Fringe team investigates, they are approached by another FBI agent, Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), who identifies the woman as Dana Gray (Paula Malcomson). Dana, who had been struck by lightning twice, was killed eighteen months earlier along with her family during a robbery of their home, but she apparently was able to walk away from the morgue. Since then, she has appeared to commit suicide with several others, but always managing to walk away. Walter (John Noble) and Bell, in studying Dana's blood samples, find that her body may have been altered by several past lightning strikes, making her incapable of dying. Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Lincoln find that Dana worked as a suicide hotline operator, and in investigating her belongings, find that she appears to have a strong desire to take her soul to heaven or hell. Lincoln comes to believe that Dana may be looking for a way to have her soul \\"stow away\\" with that of another to join her family in the afterlife, and used the suicide hotline position to find those who are close to committing suicide. Another man is found dead by a self-inflicted bullet wound, though Dana was seen leaving his apartment. Evidence in his apartment points to the construction of a bomb, and the Fringe team suspects that Dana knows its location and may be hoping to exploit an event which will kill several people simultaneously in order to increase her own chances of death. Peter calls her, using caller ID spoofing to disguise his number as that of her late husband, and the signal allows authorities to pinpoint her location to a commuter train. The train is stopped and searched, while Dana leaves on her own with the bomb, moving it far enough away from the train. The bomb soon explodes, and when Peter and Lincoln search, they find Dana's body nearby, finally dead, and the only fatality from the explosion. Peter returns home where Walter has invited Bell to stay the evening. Bell explains that he believes that Dana was finally able to die after serving a purpose--saving the lives of the people on the train.In the middle of the episode Dana had visited a nun who had procured for Dana a (fictitious) rare and very obscure religious book. The nun related one prominent story from the book about a dead man named Azrael who had been a great sinner and was accordingly trapped in Purgatory. Twenty angels felt compassion for the man and went to Purgatory to carry him to Heaven. They appealed to God to allow the man into Heaven and God permitted this on the basis that their innocence overweighed the man's sins. When church bells go off nearby, Olivia's personality slips through momentarily. Bell regains control, but expresses new-found fear that his possession of Olivia's body has become more complicated than he thought. Production The episode's teleplay was written by Danielle Dispaltro, while the story was contributed by consulting producer Akiva Goldsman and co-showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman. Supernatural veteran Charles Beeson directed. The episode was shot in early February 2011. Despite previous guest actor Leonard Nimoy's recent retirement, the writers still had plot lines concerning his character William Bell. Some months prior to the airing of \\"Stowaway\\", Nimoy and others had noted that Bell's character would return to Fringe. Anna Torv, who portrays Olivia, was not aware that her character would be channeling Bell until just prior to filming of the episode, and stated of the role, \\"This is not one I had been asking for!\\" To prepare, Torv sought advice from her fellow star John Noble, as both as a friend and because Noble's character, Walter, had spent the most time with Bell. She took further advice from the show's dialect coach and reviewed footage of Nimoy's previous work, though eventually she decided to jump right into the role. Noble later commented \\"I think the solutions she came up with ‚Äì taking the essence of the man, playing with the eyebrows, simulating the voice ‚Äî were really smart. We had a lot of fun doing it.\\" Actor Seth Gabel portrayed the prime universe version of his character Lincoln Lee. Executive producers J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pickner were both impressed with Torv's take on the role, with Wyman stating that it \\"just transcended all our expectations\\", while Pinkner noted that Nimoy himself was \\"the most proud and most impressed\\" with the outcome. Actor Joshua Jackson found her performance \\"so creepy\\". He explained, \\"In the episodes, you see I can barely look at her. I think it ended up being a good way to play Peter‚Äôs reaction to Olivia, but it was born out of the fact that when that voice came out of her, I was like: ‚ÄòOh, that‚Äôs just wrong!'\\" Pinkner confirmed in an interview with TVline that Bell's appearance would last for \\"a couple\\" episodes, and also warned that \\"cohabitation is not as benign as William assumes it is\\", a reference to problems Bell would soon have in Olivia's body. The possessed state of Olivia has led viewers to refer to her as \\"Bellivia\\". \\"Stowaway\\" featured a guest appearance by actress Paula Malcomson, her first and only time on the show to date. Guest actor Seth Gabel had previously played just one version of character Lincoln Lee, who existed as the head of Fringe division in the parallel universe. \\"Stowaway\\" marked the first appearance of the character from the prime universe. Gabel described his prime universe character as someone who works for the FBI, \\"but has no idea about Fringe Division. He's more of a desk jockey [who] eventually comes to believe there is much more than reality suggests\\". Executive producer Jeff Pinkner described Lincoln's introduction as \\"insanely fun -- the characterization Seth has created just makes you smile\\". Gabel also indicated the new character would likely return for more episodes. As with other Fringe episodes, Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children, focusing on the science seen in \\"Stowaway\\", with the intention of having \\"students learn about magnetism and how magnets can be created and demagnetized.\\" Reception =Ratings= \\"Stowaway\\" was watched by an estimated 3.8 million viewers with a 1.3 ratings share among those 18-49 on its first broadcast. It fell 13 percent in this ratings share from the previous week's episode. This was the lowest viewership for the show in the 18‚Äì49 adult demographic, though this has been partially attributed to the onset of daylight saving time and the NCAA Tournament. For that night, Fringe helped the Fox network finish in first place among the adult demographic, but it placed in third among total viewers. Time shifted viewing increased the episode's ratings among adults by 57 percent to a 2.2 ratings share. This was the largest increase in time shifting viewing for the week among network shows. =Reviews= Joshua Jackson and Anna Torv's performances were mostly praised by critics. Television critics' reviews for \\"Stowaway\\" were mostly positive. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker thought Anna Torv's Nimoy impression was \\"aces, very wry and amusing,\\" and also praised Joshua Jackson's acting in response to it. Like Tucker, Noel Murray from The A.V. Club also praised Torv and Jackson's performances, and graded the episode with a B+, explaining it \\"was an effective episode despite all its metaphysical mumbo-jumbo [because] Dana's predicament was a legitimately tense one... As she stepped on the train, I didn't know if she was planning to save the passengers or send their souls a-scattering... the suspense itself was palpable\\". Murray however admitted that \\"if the \\"villain\\" weren't so sympathetic, or if the action weren't so breathless, or if I didn't find the Bellivia material so funny, I'd probably be annoyed by the wacky way the Fringe writers have found to bring William Bell back.\\" Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times noted of Torv that her \\"cadence of her words was dead on, and his/her interactions with everyone else in Fringe Division were pitch perfect.\\" He praised other facets of the episode, including how \\"the weekly mysteries unfold like origami\\", and that introducing the prime's version of the Lincoln character allowed the audience \\"to see all the weirdness of Fringe through fresh eyes\\". SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall also lauded Torv's performance, noting that the actress \\"captures Nimoy's staccato delivery, her growling voice, even his trick eyebrow. Not since Zachary Quinto played a young Spock in Star Trek a couple of years ago have I seen anyone so perfectly sound and move like Nimoy.\\" Stegall did express a wish that the characters not try to explain every case (such as the one in the episode) out of a belief that their explanations were often absurd; this observation led Stegall to praise the new character of Lincoln however, as she believed, like Hanson, that the series has \\"been needing an Everyman in this mix for awhile, someone for whom immortality is not a commonplace.\\" Charlie Jane Anders of io9 was critical of the episode, remarking that \\"the whole 'soul magnets' thing, which had seemed to be a throwaway comment a few episodes ago, is turning out to be sort of a weak plot device. And the whole bodily-possession storyline is just perhaps one level of wackiness too far for me. I also had the feeling that this might finally be the acting challenge that was beyond Anna Torv's considerable abilities, as her Leonard Nimoy impression quickly started to grate on my nerves.\\" Notes References External links * \\"Stowaway\\" at Fox.com Fringe (season 3) episodes 2011 American television episodes Television episodes written by Akiva Goldsman ","title":"Stowaway (Fringe)"},{"id":"31157387","text":"\\"Bloodline\\" is the eighteenth episode of the third season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe, and the 61st episode overall. The storyline follows the pregnant Olivia Dunham of the parallel universe (\\"Fauxlivia\\") as she experiences a kidnapping and acceleration of her pregnancy; meanwhile, her fellow Fringe agents Lincoln Lee and Charlie Francis attempt to locate her. The episode's script was written by co-executive producers Alison Schapker and Monica Owusu-Breen, while Dennis Smith directed. \\"Bloodline\\" featured the return of guest actors Seth Gabel, Kirk Acevedo, Ryan McDonald, Andre Royo, and Amy Madigan. The Fox network released a \\"movie-style trailer\\" in the days leading up to the episode's broadcast as a special promotion. It first aired in the United States on March 25, 2011 to an estimated 3.9 million viewers. Broadcasting in the wake of a fourth season renewal, the episode's 1.5/5 ratings share was a fifteen percent increase from the previous week. \\"Bloodline\\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with several commentators characterizing the kidnapping mystery as predictable while also praising the depth of the parallel universe and its characters. Lead actress Anna Torv submitted the episode for consideration at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards, but failed to receive a nomination. Plot In the parallel universe, Fauxlivia (Anna Torv) is returned home by her mother Marilyn (Amy Madigan) after undergoing a pre-natal test to see if she has viral propagated eclampsia, a virus that killed her sister and sister's baby during childbirth. She believes she is being followed, and contacts Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) at the Fringe division, who sends over a security detail. By the time they arrive, Fauxlivia has been kidnapped; though they try to follow a secret tracker each agent carries, her abductors have extracted it to throw Fringe off their tracks. Walternate (John Noble) and Lincoln believe the abduction to be an inside job due to this. Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) identifies a vehicle that has passed by Fauxlivia's home at a high frequency, that being the taxi that belongs to Henry (Andre Royo). Lincoln and Charlie (Kirk Acevedo) track down Henry, who explains he has been keeping an eye on Fauxlivia, surprised to have seen her return and seeming like a different person than his previous encounters with her; Henry is unaware that he had actually helped the prime universe's Olivia to escape (\\"Olivia\\" and \\"The Abducted\\"). Lincoln, suspicious of these events, forces Walternate to admit that Fauxlivia was switched with Olivia, and that the child Fauxlivia carries is his grandchild. Meanwhile, Marilyn learns that Fauxlivia's test for the virus is positive and warns Charlie that Fauxlivia will die if she has the child. During the Fringe team's search, Fauxlivia finds herself being put under a treatment to accelerate her pregnancy, bringing her child near term. She is able to escape from her captors and contact Fringe division to identify her location, but struggles from labor pains as the child is about to be born. Henry drives Lincoln to her location, and they are able to help Fauxlivia to deliver her child, a son, before medical help arrives. Fauxlivia and her child recover under tight security ordered by Walternate, fearing for their safety. The doctors determine the accelerated pregnancy outpaced the virus, thus allowing both Fauxlivia and her child to survive. In the epilogue, as September, (Michael Cerveris) an Observer, watches, a blood sample from the child is drawn discreetly by one of Fauxlivia's captors posing as an orderly, who transfers it to Brandon (Ryan McDonald), who is revealed to have developed the accelerated pregnancy procedure under Walternate's orders. Meanwhile, Lincoln and Charlie become somewhat distrustful of Walternate after learning what he hid from them. They consider that Colonel Broyles (Lance Reddick) disappeared around the same time that Fauxlivia returned, and wonder what else Walternate is hiding from them. Production Andre Royo returned as Henry, a cab driver from the parallel universe. \\"Bloodline\\" was co-written by co- executive producers Monica Owusu-Breen and Alison Schapker, while The Practice veteran, Dennis Smith, directed the installment. Editor Timothy A. Good has called \\"Bloodline\\" the second of two parts ‚Äì the first half was the season's third episode \\"The Plateau\\", which Owusu-Breen and Schapker also co-wrote. Executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman had planned Fauxlivia's pregnancy since they conceived her character, but noted that \\"this isn‚Äôt going to be a normal pregnancy that you see, either. And the pregnancy is [going to evolve] in a Fringe way that you don‚Äôt comprehend yet. It's not going to be your traditional love triangle, 'I'm pregnant and having a baby' story. It‚Äôs going to be Fringe-ified.\\" In late January 2011, TVline's Michael Ausiello reported actor Andre Royo was returning for one episode later in the third season. Royo made his third guest appearance of the season in \\"Bloodline\\", as cab driver Henry Higgins from the parallel universe. It is his final credit on the series to date. Amy Madigan, who plays Olivia's mother Marilyn, also returned in a guest appearance. Previous guest stars Seth Gabel, Kirk Acevedo, Ryan McDonald, and Michael Cerveris returned as Lincoln Lee, Charlie Francis, Brandon Fayette, and September the Observer, respectively. The episode also featured one-time guest actors Kendall Cross as Nurse Joyce and Fran√ßoise Yip as Dr. Rosa Oporto. Leading up to the episode's broadcast, Fox released a \\"movie-style trailer\\" as a promotion, something they had previously done with \\"Entrada\\" and \\"Marionette\\", two episodes from earlier in the season. The video recapped the Peter/Olivia/Fauxlivia love triangle from Fauxlivia's perspective and then previewed scenes in \\"Bloodline\\". As with other Fringe episodes, Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children, focusing on the science seen in \\"Bloodline\\", with the intention of having \\"students learn about gestation and how it is different from species to species.\\" Cultural references Accelerated growth of yet- unborn children was a major plot element of \\"The Same Old Story\\", the second episode of the first season. While eclampsia is a real medical condition that can interfere with childbirth, the \\"viral-propagated eclampsia\\" presented in this episode is fictional. When Henry is located by the Fringe division, he is seen reading an \\"Opus the Peahen\\" comic, the parallel universe's counterpart to the \\"Opus\\" comic strip drawn by Berkeley Breathed. Also within the parallel universe, the movie Taxi Driver is shown to have been directed by Francis Ford Coppola rather than Martin Scorsese (though Robert De Niro was still able to improvise the \\"You talkin' to me?\\" scene), while the television series The West Wing is shown to be entering its twelfth season. Reception =Ratings= \\"Bloodline\\" aired the day after Fringes fourth season renewal was announced by Fox Entertainment, which came in the wake of various actors communicating directly with fans to watch the series. Actor Lance Reddick noted of the renewal, \\"I know so often fans think that they need us... but I would be digging ditches or something else if it wasn't for you. So ‚Äî thank you. Really.\\" SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall was surprised but delighted by the network's decision, stating \\"That any network, let alone Fox, had the patience and the faith to renew this show is, for me, little short of a miracle. It was a week, it seems, for wonders.\\" \\"Bloodline\\" first aired in the United States on March 25, 2011. It was watched by an estimated 3.9 million viewers, earning a 1.5/5 ratings share among the 18‚Äì49 demographic, up from the previous episode's 1.3‚Äì1.4 rating. This was a 15 percent increase. Fringe helped Fox place in second for the night among adult viewers behind NBC, but the network fell into third place among total viewers behind NBC and ABC. =Reviews= Anna Torv's performance in \\"Bloodline\\" was a particular source of praise from critics. She submitted the episode for consideration at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards in 2011. \\"Bloodline\\" has received generally mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Sarah Stegall enjoyed it, commenting that \\"This was one of the more quietly brilliant episodes of Fringe to date. Reaching all the way back to the first season for its genesis, it was still firmly rooted in the most up-to-date events, tied together several characters in a cabal of resistance, paved the way for major drama down the way, and gave us some emotional highlights we cannot expect to see from Our Side characters.\\" Entertainment Weekly staff writer Ken Tucker called the episode \\"a beautifully modulated hour, written by Alison Schapker and Monica Owusu-Breen, that took care to establish the anxiety felt by Altivia and her mother, Marilyn (Amy Madigan) about the pregnancy.\\" On a slightly less positive note, Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode with a B+. He remarked that it \\"starts out intense and crazy\\" but \\"becomes fairly predictable in its second half,\\" as he correctly predicted Walternate's involvement in the abduction. Murray concluded, \\"Ultimately, 'Bloodline' is more of a plot-mover than most episodes of Fringe. There‚Äôs no additional case to solve, and no profound theme to explore. If anything, it‚Äôs like the writers decided to inject a serum into the belly of show and accelerate the story, to get Fauxlivia‚Äôs baby out and to get on to the next phase.\\" IGN's Ramsey Isler also didn't find the birth storyline all that shocking \\"since the number of people that had the power and knowledge to do this kind of thing was low.\\" Rating the episode 7.5/10, Isler added that \\"the story could have used a bit more misdirection and a red herring or two to really keep us guessing, but that's a minor critique. Overall, Walternate's Machiavellian role in this story works, and the most important takeaway from this story is that it moved the overarching plot forward in one huge leap. Instead of waiting nine 'story' months for Fauxlivia's baby to pop out, we've already got the kid ready to fit into whatever plot twist the show runners have planned.\\" Some television critics have praised the parallel universe's characterization, with one noting that the \\"writers have made us care about the other side of this war, forced us to see the opposite numbers of our heroes as real and human and sympathetic; it's a brilliant move.\\" The alternate performances of the actors in particular have been highlighted, especially those of Torv and Noble, but also those of Gabel, Acevedo, and Nicole. =Awards and nominations= Anna Torv submitted \\"Bloodline\\", along with the season three episodes \\"Olivia\\", \\"Entrada\\", Marionette\\", and \\"The Day We Died\\", for consideration in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series category at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards.

It has three seats: in Venegono Inferiore (Varese province), Seveso (Monza e Brianza Province) and in Milan. The latter also hosts the Istituto sacerdotale Maria Immacolata, that trains priests during the first five years following ordination, and the Istituto Superiore di Scienze Religiose; other diocesan activities have taken place there. In the other two sites seminarist theology training is conducted: in Seveso I and II theology with the corso propedeutico, in Venegono from III to VI theology. History The first seminary dates to the times of St. Charles Borromeo, opening in 1564. Under the bishopric of Federico Borromeo the Seminary of Porta Orientale took final form. St. Charles built several locations in the diocese. From 1638 to 1784 three operated in Milan (the Seminary of Porta Orientale, the Seminary of Canonica, the Collegio Elvetico), along with four minor seminaries in Monza, Arona, Celana and Pollegio. First reform school and then the presence of Napoleon's troops radically transformed the seminary: the diocesan seminaries Celana, Collegio Elvetico, Seminary of Canonica and later Arona closed; a structure in Castello above Lecco opened instead. In 1839 that seat transferred to the Dominican convent of St. Peter Martyr in Seveso. With this step the configuration seminary route became simplified: ginnasio in Seveso, liceo in Monza and theology in Milan. In the second part of the nineteenth century a seminary for poor students opened in Monza, entrusted to Barnabite Luigi Villoresi: training became more flexible and open according to inspiration from Antonio Rosmini. The resulting clergy were visibly different from the traditional way: this led to tensions. In 1900 a seminary opened near the Duomo that took the name Seminarietto, aimed at training those who were intended for liturgical service in the cathedral. Following the apostolic visitation of abbot Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster, then Archbishop of Milan, the site of Venegono Inferiore was built with the intention to move the center of the seminary there. Construction began in 1928 and the facility was solemnly inaugurated in 1935. In the following decades, when the liceo classico and the last three years of theology were placed in Venegono, several locations were used: Seveso (medie-ginnasio), Masnago (elementari-medie), Arcore (medie), Merate (medie), Seminarietto del Duomo (ginnasio-liceo), Saronno (biennium theological and comunit√† propedeutica), Milano (adult vocations). In 1966 Cardinal Giovanni Colombo decided to transfer the theological faculty (built by Pope Leo XIII in 1892) from Venegono Inferiore to Milan, thus forming the Facolt√† Teologica dell'Italia Settentrionale. The vocational crisis in subsequent years forced a reorganization of the community and led to the closure of many facilities. In 1985 the site was closed in Seveso: the ginnasio was transferred to Venegono and after a few years began restructuring. When construction ended in 1998 the community since then living in Saronno was transferred in Seveso. With the gradual extinction of the minor Seminary (closed in 2002 after several attempts for renewal and revitalization), the comunit√† propedeutica was added to the biennium seminary in Seveso. The restoration of the permanent diaconate wanted by Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini in 1986 found a place in the headquarters of the Seminary.

Design was by Jeff Grubb with Andria Hayday, the cover was by Fred Fields, and illustrations by Karl Waller. Reception Allen Varney reviewed Land of Fate for Dragon magazine #219 (July 1995). He began by saying: \\"It makes sense, unfortunately, that the Land of Fate box quickly followed the Al-Qadim rulebook as its first supplement. The rulebook briefly introduced the setting of Zakhara, but this set described it at length. A campaign needs this basic data\\", but with everything in Land of Fate, he said, \\"It's all very large.\\" He went on to say: \\"In principle the jottings of a campaign set can be satisfying in themselves. In the Land of Fate set, they make for dry reading. We get a useful chapter on all aspects of daily life, and a couple of wonderful sidebar articles on the Zakharan coffee ceremony (\\"the measure of a good host\\") and pearl diving, the stuff of memorable scenes in an adventure. The rest is a sandstorm of little details, one-paragraph character outlines, societal tidbits (we're told twice that worshippers in Zakhara \\"prostrate\\" themselves), and jottings. With work you could assemble any dozen jottings into a free-wheeling adventure like the loose-jointed Arabian Nights tales, where one thing follows another without much logic. But not much of Land of Fate matches the screwy imagination of the best Nights tales. At times the designer's creativity clearly flags, such as in this candid beginning to an entry describing the secrets of Hilm: \\"The City of Kindness is boring.\\" And, as with the rulebook, there is no hint in all these pages of how to develop these jottings into a memorable, characteristically Arabian campaign.\\" Varney concluded the review by saying: \\"Parts of the Land of Fate boxed set enhance any Al-Qadim campaign, but its length is excessive and its inspiration uneven. Unless you plan to construct a long, ambitious campaign, you can probably get along without this box.\\" Reviews *White Wolf #34 References Al-Qadim ","title":"Land of Fate"},{"id":"31157469","text":"Ivan Ivanovich Okhlobystin (; born 22 July 1966) is a Russian Orthodox priest, actor, director and screenwriter. By his own choice, he is temporarily suspended as priest from the ministry of the Russian Orthodox Church. He is the creative director of the company Baon. Early life Ivan Ivanovich Okhlobystin was born on 22 July 1966 in the recreation center \\"Polenovo\\" (Zaoksky District of the Tula Oblast), where his father, Ivan Ivanovich Okhlobystin, was a military doctor, and a participant in the Great Patriotic War. He was then 62 years old, and worked as the head physician at Polenovo. His mother, Albina Ivanovna Stavitskaya, (Okhlobystina by her first marriage) (maiden name Belyaeva), was an engineer-economist. She was then a 19 year-old student. His mother remarried to Anatoly Stavitsky, and Ivan had a brother Stanislav Stavitsky. For some time the family lived in a village near Maloyaroslavets in the Kaluga Oblast, afterwards they all moved to Moscow. After graduation, he entered the directing faculty at VGIK. Ivan studied on the same course with many future luminaries of Russian cinema: Tigran Keosayan, Bakhtiyar Khudoynazarov, Fyodor Bondarchuk, Aleksandr Bashirov, Rashid Nugmanov and others. On the parallel course (at the screenwriting faculty) Renata Litvinova, Roman Kachanov and others were studying at that time. Subsequently, Ivan continued the friendship and cooperation which began at the institute with many of them. Without graduating, he was drafted into the army. After serving in the rocket forces in Rostov-on-Don, he reinstated himself at the institute. There he completely immersed himself in public work and was elected secretary of the Union of Cinematographers of the USSR. In 1992 he graduated from the directing department of VGIK (workshop of Igor Talankin). Career =Success in the 1990s ‚Äî present day= Okhlobystin's career began with the picture \\"The Leg\\" by Nikita Tyagunov, which was released on the screens in 1991, he received the prize as best actor at the festival \\"Molodost-1991\\" (because of superstitious reasons he was credited under the pseudonym of Ivan Chuzhoy). The first script written by Ivan Okhlobystin - for the film \\"The Freak\\" directed by Roman Kachanov - was nominated for the prestigious award \\"Green Apple, Gold Leaf\\". The first full-length director's work of Okhlobystin - \\"Arbiter\\" with a soundtrack featuring the bands Piknik and \\"Obermaneken\\" - was awarded the Kinotavr award in the category \\"Films for the Elect\\". In 1997, Okhlobystin acted in the movie Mama Don't Cry in an episodic role of a bandit. At the same time Okhlobystin took part in theatrical productions. On February 16, 1996 in the Moscow Art Theater premiered a theatre piece based on his play \\"The Villain, or Cry of the Dolphin\\" staged by Mikhail Efremov. In the same Moscow Art Theater, a second theatre piece of Okhlobystin was staged: \\"Maximilian the Stylite\\", in 1999 the director Roman Kachanov adapted the play about the new-born seer for film and released it under the title of \\"Maximilian\\". In the late 1990s, Ivan wrote for the magazine \\"Stolitsa\\" but soon left the publication, because as he said, it turned into a \\"brothel\\", then worked in the staff of the weekly \\"Vesti\\". In 1999 Ivan Okhlobystin acted in the popular crime-comedy 8 ¬Ω $ directed by Grigori Konstantinopolsky together with Fyodor Bondarchuk. Work in the cinema continued in 2000 with the cult film Demobbed, the script to which Okhlobystin wrote in co-authorship with the film's director Kachanov; the plot of the film was partly based on Okhlobystin's own memories of service in the army. In 2001, based on his own screenplay, the same director shot one more comedy - Down House. In addition, he was the screenwriter of the philosophical drama Garbage Man (2001) directed by Georgi Shengelia. Between 2010-2016 he played the cynical head of the therapy department Andrey Bykov, in the medical sitcom Interns which aired on TNT. In 2017 he starred in comedy-drama Bird about a rock musician who becomes friends with a girl suffering from tuberculosis. =Political and religious views= Okhlobystin became popular in the late 1990s but, following a religious conversion, withdrew to a monastery and became a Russian Orthodox priest. Patriarch Kirill removed Okhlobystin from the priesthood on February 2010, banned him wearing priestly vestments and priestly cross. In early 2010, Ivan resumed his entertainment career. Later that year he was named the creative director of Euroset, Russia's largest handset retailer. Okhlobystin plays the head of the therapy department in the medical sitcom Interny. On 5 September 2011 he announced that he would run for President of Russia in 2012 through the \\"Sky Coalition\\", but later gave up the idea, citing the opinion of the Russian Orthodox Church. Appearing in RTVi's (Echo Moskvy's) Without Fools broadcast on 2 December 2012, Okhlobystin declared himself to be a \\"national-patriot\\" and claimed to \\"know\\" that \\"in the year when the head of State and the head of Church in Russia will both die\\", he will become the next President of the new Russian Empire. Saying \\"the Russian people will vote for me, and the Russian Church will anoint me,\\" he stated that he would immediately put up a new Iron Wall around Russia and start a campaign of \\"cleansing\\" in order to \\"rebuild the Russian nation.\\" Okhlobystin is known for his homophobic views. In December 2013, he said that he wanted to \\"burn homosexuals alive,\\" describing them as a \\"constant threat to his children,\\" and that he could not watch this \\"Sodom and Gomorrah\\" any longer. In July 2014, a \\"creative evening\\" with Okhlobystin in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv was cancelled \\"due to anti-Ukrainian statements by Okhlobystin.\\" In November 2014, Okhlobystin visited Donetsk and declared his support for Novorussia.

Publication history Assassin Mountain was designed by Wolfgang Baur. Reception Allen Varney reviewed Assassin Mountain for Dragon magazine #219 (July 1995). He called the sourcebox \\"inventive\\", noting that Baur was involved in many Al- Qadim supplements, and that Secrets of the Lamp was much more characteristic of his work than Assassin Mountain. Varney states in his conclusion of the review: \\"The approach in Assassin Mountain is unique in the Al-Qadim line. Eschewing a barrage of colorful magic, Baur develops a claustrophobic atmosphere of paranoia and intrigue. Character interactions drive the plot, and the occasional fire elementals and gibbering mouther are tools to develop the narrative. These morally ambiguous adventures, modern takes on classic Arabian settings, require and reward good role-playing. Several scenes here will put role-players through the wringer, and they'll love it. But the plots also assume highly pragmatic PCs. If you or your group wouldn't feel comfortable allying with assassins, steer clear. I have trouble with this idea myself, and though Assassin Mountain is an accomplished work, it's not what I think of as the stuff of Arabian adventure.\\" Reviews *White Wolf #43 References Al-Qadim ","title":"Assassin Mountain"},{"id":"31157481","text":"A Dozen and One Adventures is an accessory for the 2nd edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy tabletop role-playing game, published in 1993.

Arthur Dreifuss directed Van Johnson in a fictional account of the German Operation Greif during the Battle of the Bulge. Columbia contract stars Dick York and Kerwin Mathews also star in the film. Technical advisor to the film was Major John W. McClain who was a company commander with the 23rd Infantry.http://www.lonesentry.com/unithistory/23rd-infantry/index.html A novelisation of the screenplay was written by Walter Freeman. Plot Several American GIs plan an escape from a German prisoner-of-war camp. Among them is a German, Lt. Hans von Kroner, known to them as Sgt. Richardson, who is working undercover, spying on the prisoners and polishing up his American English. Reporting the escape plan to the Camp Commandant, Von Kroner is told he is being removed from the camp as part of a top secret project gathering all fluent English-speaking members of the Wehrmacht for an unstated reason. The prisoners' plan fails and many die. Von Kroner is sent to a German castle with others for Operation Greif (called \\"Operation OK Butch\\" in the film), where they will dress in American uniforms and spearhead the Ardennes Offensive by committing sabotage, confusing enemy forces, and seizing key objectives for the attacking German forces. Assisting in the training, Von Kroner is assigned a team of three other men with various skills including a Waffen SS Officer, Wilitz, who regales his comrades with stories of his exploits in terrorizing unfortunates whilst a member of the Brown Shirts. Von Kroner's team's activities and the initial German assault meet with success, but both soon run into unexpected difficulty. Von Kroner's forged orders are countermanded by a decimated American infantry company of the 23rd Infantry that forces them into being replacements, while the bad weather that made the German assault successful ends, enabling American air power to attack the Germans. In their new unit, Von Kroner meets Sgt. Ludwig and Cpl. Ennis, whom he knew in the prisoner camp; they say they were the only survivors of their escape, as the Germans knew about it and ambushed them. Obtaining plans for an American counterattack against a strategic crossroads, Von Kroner warns the Germans by radio of the American attack but is ordered to stay with the Americans to ensure that the attack fails. Von Kroner's team sabotage a jeep with a bomb, killing the company commander, and attempt to destroy the unit's other vehicle, a weapons carrier, arousing Ludwig's suspicion. The company attacks a German position with Wilitz using the opportunity to shoot their lieutenant in the back, placing Ludwig in command. Several German prisoners are taken, and Richardson/Von Kroner volunteers to take them to Battalion headquarters. He returns to tell his comrades that the prisoners didn't want to escape; they wanted to surrender to the Americans with Von Kroner taking them in. A furious Wilitz insists that Von Kroner should have shot the lot of them. With news of German infiltrators behind American lines spreading, Ludwig is further suspicious when Wilitz doesn't know what the American \\"hot foot\\" is. Cast Van Johnson ... Lt.

The creek flows along the border between Snyder County and Juniata County. Historically, numerous sawmills and gristmills have been built on the creek. The first inhabitants of the area arrived in the late 1700s. In the 1750s, Peter and Michael Shaffer had land grants along and near the mouth of Mahantango Creek. They were both farmers, Michael also had a lumber mill and a distillery. The watershed of the creek has an area of . Trout inhabit the tributaries of Mahantango Creek, but not the main stem. Smallmouth bass, however, may inhabit Mahantango Creek itself. Course Mahantango Creek begins at the border between Perry Township, Snyder County, Chapman Township, Snyder County, and Susquehanna Township, Juniata County. The creek's headwaters are at the confluence of North Branch Mahantango Creek and West Branch Mahantango Creek, near Pennsylvania Route 104. It heads southeast for a short distance and then turns northeast. Shortly afterwards, it turns southeast again, passing by the community of Mahantango. The creek then turns nearly due-south and crosses under U.S. Route 11 and U.S. Route 15. Shortly afterwards, it reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River. Mahantango Creek joins the Susquehanna River upstream of its mouth and upstream of Harrisburg. =Tributaries= Mahantango Creek has two named tributaries. These are North Branch Mahantango Creek and West Branch Mahantango Creek. West Branch Mahantango Creek is long and North Branch Mahantango Creek is long. Both of these tributaries' headwaters are in Bald Eagle State Park. Hydrology, geography and geology There is a broken flint ridge between Richfield and Mahantango Creek. A feature known as McKee's Half Falls is located near the creek's mouth. There are also limestone and sandstone formations at the mouth of the creek. A rock formation known as the Marcellus black slate forms visible outcrops at the headwaters of the creek. Mahantango Creek forms part of the border between Snyder County and Juniata County. In 2009, a $600,000 project was to alleviate soil erosion on Mahantango Creek was carried out.

Parts of the watershed of Mahantango Creek are rural and is mostly used for agricultural purposes. History Mahantango Creek's name comes from the Delaware word mahantongo, which means \\"where we had plenty to eat\\". It was apparently named after a group of Native Americans had a large meal on the creek. George Herrold had a tract of land on the creek in 1765. It is unlikely, but possible, that Peter Shaffer settled on the creek around 1765. Michael Witmer gained access to a tract of land on Mahantango Creek around 1770. In May 1772, there were plans to construct a road from Sunbury to Mahantango Creek. The Mahantongo Methodist Circuit historically included the watershed of the creek. Historically, there were twelve gristmills and fourteen sawmills on Mahantango Creek and its tributaries. As late as 1919, there were still a large number of mills in the watershed, including the Old West Perry Mill, producing fermented pear cider, or perry, which was built in 1778. In March 1901, flooding and ice jams severely damaged a number of bridges over Mahantango Creek. There are two covered bridges located on Mahantango Creek near Pennsylvania Route 104. One of them is called the North Oriental Covered Bridge and was built in 1908. The other is known as the Sheaffer Covered Bridge and was built in 1907. Both bridges are burr arch truss bridges.

White on July 1, 2008, following 10 years of service to the university in his capacity as vice chancellor for university advancement. As chancellor, Dr. Gearhart instituted the first tuition freeze in 24 years and implemented a $220 million campus building renovation and refurbishment plan, as well as a campus-wide energy savings plan. He has also undertaken a renewed emphasis on the arts on campus, including the establishment of the ‚ÄúAll Steinway Campus.‚Äù Under his leadership campus enrollment increased by more than 10 percent in two years, record research awards were recorded, and the university was reclassified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as RU/VH‚Äî‚Äúresearch university/very high,‚Äù the foundation‚Äôs top research classification. Career in higher education =Early career= In 1977, Gearhart was appointed the director of development at Westminster College and led fundraising efforts for the Winston Churchill Memorial and Library. He returned to his native state in 1978 to become vice president for development at Hendrix College. After four years at Hendrix, Gearhart was selected to be the director of development at the University of Arkansas. In 1985, Gearhart was appointed vice president for development and university relations at Pennsylvania State University, becoming senior vice president three years later. While at Penn State, he launched a major capital campaign, which raised in excess of $352 million. Total private gifts to Penn State during his 11 years at the university surpassed $950 million. In 1995, Gearhart joined the international consulting firm of Grenzebach, Glier, and Associates as senior vice president and managing director. =Career at the University of Arkansas= Gearhart returned to Arkansas in 1998 as vice chancellor for university advancement at the University of Arkansas. In that capacity, he was the architect of the Campaign for the Twenty-First Century, a billion-dollar capital campaign that concluded in June 2005 with the University of Arkansas taking its place as one of only 13 public universities at that time to have exceeded a billion dollars raised. The centerpiece of this campaign was a $300 million gift from the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation, the largest gift ever made to a public university. The direct results of Gearhart‚Äôs leadership in this effort included the creation of 132 new endowed faculty positions, 1,738 new student scholarship and fellowship funds, dozens of new and renovated facilities and classrooms, and growth of the overall endowment from $119 million in 1998 to nearly $900 million by the time he assumed the chancellorship. In 2013, Gearhart became involved in a scandal with then Vice Chancellor for University Advancement Brad Choate over budget shortfalls in the fundraising division of the institution. Choate, whose contract was not renewed, oversaw the overspending of the division's budget. In response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by the Arkansas Democrat Gazette regarding the budget shortfalls, the university determined that the requested record was exempt because it was an employee evaluation and job performance record involving Choate and another university employee. After receiving permission from both employees to release the record, the university provided it to the newspaper. To satisfy public concerns about the division‚Äôs budget shortfalls, Gearhart requested an audit of Advancement finances by the Arkansas Division of Legislative Audit and the University of Arkansas System. The audit report was jointly published on September 11, 2013. At the subsequent meeting of the Legislature's auditing committee, a former university employee made allegations that Gearhart had fostered a \\"culture of secrecy\\" and directed the destruction of relevant documents. A prosecutor then investigated allegations that the University had violated the Freedom of Information Act (which would be a criminal offense under Arkansas law), but the prosecutor found no evidence of criminal activity. The prosecutor‚Äôs review included conflicting testimony from several witnesses, some indicating that Gearhart had told them to \\"get rid of\\" a document. However, the prosecutor determined that the document in question was not responsive to any FOIA request and thus had no bearing on the matter at hand. Leadership Chancellor Emeritus Gearhart crosses Maple Street on campus in Fayetteville In addition to his responsibilities as chancellor, Gearhart is a tenured member of the faculty in the College of Education and Health Professions, holding the rank of professor. A nationally respected expert in capital campaigns, he is the author of two books, The Capital Campaign in Higher Education and Philanthropy, Fund Raising and the Capital Campaign, as well as numerous articles. Gearhart is also an advocate for the DREAM Act, which provides a path to citizenship for alien minors. In 2014, following a decision from Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Chris Piazza, the University of Arkansas began offering spousal benefits to same-sex married couples. Following the Supreme Court's stay of Piazza's decision, however, all campuses in the University of Arkansas System, including the University of Arkansas, could no longer offer these benefits. Among his current professional affiliations, Gearhart serves as vice president of the University of Arkansas Fayetteville Campus Foundation, is a member of the board of advisors for the Arkansas World Trade Center, is a member of the Northwest Arkansas Council, and is a member of the advisory board of the Pryor Center for Oral and Visual History. He also is a licensed attorney in the state of Arkansas. Personal A native of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Gearhart is married to the former Jane Brockmann, whom he married in 1974.

An ancient breed, it was officially recognised only in 2010; it is now one of the fifteen indigenous horse \\"breeds of limited distribution\\" listed by the AIA, the Italian breeders' association. The Lazio region has assigned it the conservation status \\"at risk of erosion\\". The population numbers about 800, of which most are in the comune of Monte Romano in the province of Viterbo; a herd of approximately 200 is at Ponzano Romano in the province of Rome, and others are in the province of Rieti. History The breed register for the Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale was opened on 19 October 2010, and the breed standard confirmed by Ministerial Decree 27202, dated 1 December 2010. DNA testing had shown that the traditional working horse of the Maremma of Lazio was not only physically but genetically distinguishable from its counterpart in the Tuscan Maremma, the Maremmano, with which it had previously been classed. The two populations are reported as having common origins but limited overlap, with the Roman horse showing greater variability and a higher proportion of \\"ancestral\\" genes; Ripert reports informally that the Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale has 38.5% genes of the original type, while the registered Maremmano population has only 12%. The genetic study, carried out by the Consorzio per la Sperimentazione, Divulgazione e Applicazione di Biotecniche Innovative (CONSDABI), National Focal Point for Italy of the Animal Genetic Resources project of the FAO, was presented at the 12th conference on ‚ÄúNew findings in equine practice‚Äù held at Druento (Turin, Italy), 11‚Äì13 November 2010. The ARSIAL (regional agency for development and innovation in agriculture of Lazio) suggests that this is the same horse breed as the \\"Cavallo Romano\\" that was well described in 19th century treatises; authors who discuss the Cavallo Romano include Moreschi (1903) and Fogliata (1910). It is also suggested that the Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale descends from the horses of the ancient Romans, such as that of Marcus Aurelius, or even of the Etruscans. Characteristics The Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale may be bay, black, chestnut or grey; limited facial markings (star and stripe) are permitted, as are white socks. Males measure at the withers, females . The girth and cannon measurements are similar for both sexes, approximately and respectively. The head is well set on, slightly long and heavy, and the profile convex or Roman; the neck is thick, muscular and arched, the mane and tail long and thick. The shoulder is muscular and tends to be straight, the chest is broad with substantial muscle, the girth is deep and the back is short, straight and muscular, sometimes slightly concave. The croup is broad and sloping, and the tail is set low. The legs are solid, strong and muscular, the hooves broad and strong. Horses with concave profile, long or drooping ears, or poor conformation of the legs are not admitted for registration. The action of the Cavallo Romano is lively and well-marked, and its temperament docile and courageous. It is sure-footed on even the most difficult terrain. For comparison, the description of the Cavallo Romano given by Moreschi in 1903 is this: Uses Although sometimes employed in the past as a warhorse and as a carriage horse, the primary use of the Cavallo Romano was as a working horse for the management of open-range livestock, particularly horses, cattle and sheep. Until the land drainage and reclamation of the fascist era the Maremma region was, like the campagna romana and the Pontine Marshes, wild and inhospitable, and inhabited mostly by vast herds of livestock, transhumant shepherds and the cavalcanti, the \\"riders\\", as the butteri of the Maremma Laziale were called. The traditions of the cavalcanti and their style of working riding, the Monta italiana da lavoro, are still taught and transmitted by a small number of riding academies. In addition to herding work, the Cavallo Romano is used today as a saddle horse for trekking; other uses include agricultural and light draught work, use as pack animals, and the production of high quality meat and of milk for paediatric or cosmetic use.

This means simply that for any two submodules N1 and N2 of M, either N_1subseteq N_2 or N_2subseteq N_1. A module is called a serial module if it is a direct sum of uniserial modules. A ring R is called a right uniserial ring if it is uniserial as a right module over itself, and likewise called a right serial ring if it is a right serial module over itself. Left uniserial and left serial rings are defined in an analogous way, and are in general distinct from their right counterparts. An easy motivational example is the quotient ring mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} for any integer n>1. This ring is always serial, and is uniserial when n is a prime power. The term uniserial has been used differently from the above definition: for clarification see this section. A partial alphabetical list of important contributors to the theory of serial rings includes the mathematicians Keizo Asano, I. S. Cohen, P.M. Cohn, Yu. Drozd, D. Eisenbud, A. Facchini, A.W. Goldie, Phillip Griffith, I. Kaplansky, V.V Kirichenko, G. K√∂the, H. Kuppisch, I. Murase, T. Nakayama, P. P≈ô√≠hoda, G. Puninski, and R. Warfield. References for each author can be found in and . Following the common ring theoretic convention, if a left/right dependent condition is given without mention of a side (for example, uniserial, serial, Artinian, Noetherian) then it is assumed the condition holds on both the left and right. Unless otherwise specified, each ring in this article is a ring with unity, and each module is unital. Properties of uniserial and serial rings and modules It is immediate that in a uniserial R-module M, all submodules except M and 0 are simultaneously essential and superfluous. If M has a maximal submodule, then M is a local module. M is also clearly a uniform module and thus is directly indecomposable. It is also easy to see that every finitely generated submodule of M can be generated by a single element, and so M is a B√©zout module. It is known that the endomorphism ring EndR(M) is a semilocal ring which is very close to a local ring in the sense that EndR(M) has at most two maximal right ideals. If M is required to be Artinian or Noetherian, then EndR(M) is a local ring. Since rings with unity always have a maximal right ideal, a right uniserial ring is necessarily local. As noted before, a finitely generated right ideal can be generated by a single element, and so right uniserial rings are right B√©zout rings. A right serial ring R necessarily factors in the form R=oplus_{i=1}^n e_{i}R where each ei is an idempotent element and eiR is a local, uniserial module. This indicates that R is also a semiperfect ring, which is a stronger condition than being a semilocal ring. K√∂the showed that the modules of Artinian principal ideal rings (which are a special case of serial rings) are direct sums of cyclic submodules. Later, Cohen and Kaplansky determined that a commutative ring R has this property for its modules if and only if R is an Artinian principal ideal ring. Nakayama showed that Artinian serial rings have this property on their modules, and that the converse is not true The most general result, perhaps, on the modules of a serial ring is attributed to Drozd and Warfield: it states that every finitely presented module over a serial ring is a direct sum of cyclic uniserial submodules (and hence is serial). If additionally the ring is assumed to be Noetherian, the finitely presented and finitely generated modules coincide, and so all finitely generated modules are serial. Being right serial is preserved under direct products of rings and modules, and preserved under quotients of rings. Being uniserial is preserved for quotients of rings and modules, but never for products. A direct summand of a serial module is not necessarily serial, as was proved by Puninski, but direct summands of finite direct sums of uniserial modules are serial modules . It has been verified that Jacobson's conjecture holds in Noetherian serial rings. Examples Any simple module is trivially uniserial, and likewise semisimple modules are serial modules. Many examples of serial rings can be gleaned from the structure sections above. Every valuation ring is a uniserial ring, and all Artinian principal ideal rings are serial rings, as is illustrated by semisimple rings. More exotic examples include the upper triangular matrices over a division ring Tn(D), and the group ring mathbb{F}[G] for some finite field of prime characteristic p and group G having a cyclic normal p-Sylow subgroup. Structure This section will deal mainly with Noetherian serial rings and their subclass, Artinian serial rings. In general, rings are first broken down into indecomposable rings. Once the structure of these rings are known, the decomposable rings are direct products of the indecomposable ones. Also, for semiperfect rings such as serial rings, the basic ring is Morita equivalent to the original ring. Thus if R is a serial ring with basic ring B, and the structure of B is known, the theory of Morita equivalence gives that Rcong mathrm{End}_B(P) where P is some finitely generated progenerator B. This is why the results are phrased in terms of indecomposable, basic rings. In 1975, Kirichenko and Warfield independently and simultaneously published analyses of the structure of Noetherian, non-Artinian serial rings. The results were the same however the methods they used were very different from each other. The study of hereditary, Noetherian, prime rings, as well as quivers defined on serial rings were important tools. The core result states that a right Noetherian, non-Artinian, basic, indecomposable serial ring can be described as a type of matrix ring over a Noetherian, uniserial domain V, whose Jacobson radical J(V) is nonzero. This matrix ring is a subring of Mn(V) for some n, and consists of matrices with entries from V on and above the diagonal, and entries from J(V) below. Artinian serial ring structure is classified in cases depending on the quiver structure. It turns out that the quiver structure for a basic, indecomposable, Artinian serial ring is always a circle or a line. In the case of the line quiver, the ring is isomorphic to the upper triangular matrices over a division ring (note the similarity to the structure of Noetherian serial rings in the preceding paragraph). A complete description of structure in the case of a circle quiver is beyond the scope of this article, but the complete description can be found in . To paraphrase the result as it appears there: A basic Artinian serial ring whose quiver is a circle is a homomorphic image of a \\"blow-up\\" of a basic, indecomposable, serial quasi-Frobenius ring. A decomposition uniqueness property Two modules U and V are said to have the same monogeny class, denoted [U]m=[V]m, if there exists a monomorphism Urightarrow V and a monomorphism Vrightarrow U. The dual notion can be defined: the modules are said to have the same epigeny class, denoted [U]_e=[V]_e , if there exists an epimorphism Urightarrow V and an epimorphism Vrightarrow U. The following weak form of the Krull-Schmidt theorem holds. Let U1,... Un, V1, ..., Vt be n+t non-zero uniserial right modules over a ring R. Then the direct sums U_1oplusdotsoplus U_n and V_1oplusdotsoplus V_t are isomorphic R-modules if and only if n=t and there exist two permutations sigma and tau of 1,2,...,n such that [U_i]_m=[V_{sigma(i)}]_m and [U_i]_e=[V_{tau(i)}]_e for every i=1,2,..., n. This result, due to Facchini, has been extended to infinite direct sums of uniserial modules by P≈ô√≠hoda in 2006. This extension involves the so-called quasismall uniserial modules. These modules were defined by Nguyen Viet Dung and Facchini, and their existence was proved by Puninski. The weak form of the Krull-Schmidt Theorem holds not only for uniserial modules, but also for several other classes of modules (biuniform modules, cyclically presented modules over serial rings, kernels of morphisms between indecomposable injective modules, couniformly presented modules.) Notes on alternate, similar and related terms Right uniserial rings can also be referred to as right chain rings or right valuation rings. This latter term alludes to valuation rings, which are by definition commutative, uniserial domains. By the same token, uniserial modules have been called chain modules, and serial modules semichain modules. The notion of a catenary ring has \\"chain\\" as its namesake, but it is in general not related to chain rings. In the 1930s, Gottfried K√∂the and Keizo Asano introduced the term Einreihig (literally \\"one-series\\") during investigations of rings over which all modules are direct sums of cyclic submodules . For this reason, uniserial was used to mean \\"Artinian principal ideal ring\\" even as recently as the 1970s. K√∂the's paper also required a uniserial ring to have a unique composition series, which not only forces the right and left ideals to be linearly ordered, but also requires that there be only finitely many ideals in the chains of left and right ideals. Because of this historical precedent, some authors include the Artinian condition or finite composition length condition in their definitions of uniserial modules and rings. Expanding on K√∂the's work, Tadashi Nakayama used the term generalized uniserial ring to refer to an Artinian serial ring. Nakayama showed that all modules over such rings are serial. Artinian serial rings are sometimes called Nakayama algebras, and they have a well-developed module theory. Warfield used the term homogeneously serial module for a serial module with the additional property that for any two finitely generated submodules A and B, A/J(A)cong B/J(B) where J(-) denotes the Jacobson radical of the module . In a module with finite composition length, this has the effect of forcing the composition factors to be isomorphic, hence the \\"homogeneous\\" adjective. It turns out that a serial ring R is a finite direct sum of homogeneously serial right ideals if and only if R is isomorphic to a full nxn matrix ring over a local serial ring. Such rings are also known as primary decomposable serial rings .

South Carolina, 497 U.S. 376 (1990), is one of a long series of U.S. Supreme Court cases determining the borders of the state of Georgia. In this case, the Court decided the exact border within the Savannah River and whether islands should be a part of Georgia or South Carolina. It also decided the seaward border.Georgia v. South Carolina, . Background In 1787, the two states agreed in the Treaty of Beaufort that the boundary along the Savannah River was the river's \\"most northern branch or stream,\\" \\"reserving all islands in [the river] to Georgia\\".497 U.S. at 376-77. In a subsequent 1922 Supreme Court decision, also called Georgia v. South Carolina, 257 U.S. 516, also held that all islands in the river belong to Georgia, but that the border should be in the middle of the river between the two shores, with the border halfway between any island and the South Carolina shore. Since the 1922 case, a number of new islands had been created in the river between the city of Savannah and the ocean, due to the deposit of dredging spoilage or the natural deposit of sediments. In some cases, the new islands were on the South Carolina side of the previously drawn boundary, and Georgia claimed that once a new island emerged, the border should be moved to the midpoint between the new island and the South Carolina shore of the river. In some cases, the state of South Carolina had been collecting property tax from the land owners and policing the land in question for a number of years.497 U.S. at 392-3. When an island causes the border to leave the middle of the river, it raises the question as to how the border line should return to the middle of the river at each end of the island. South Carolina advocated a right angle bend at each tip of the island, while Georgia advocated a \\"triequidistant\\" method which kept the border an equal distance between the two shores and the tip of the island (resulting in a smooth curve.)497 U.S. at 401. The Savannah River north of Elba Island was particularly wide, and the Army Corps of Engineers built a training wall to narrow the channel to prevent it from filling up with silt. The Corps also filled the area behind the training wall with dredging spoilage. Both South Carolina and Georgia claimed the land that was created behind the training wall, even though it was on the South Carolina side of the river. This new land was called \\"Denwill and Horseshoe Shoal\\".497 U.S. at 402. Given the valuable natural resources off the Atlantic Ocean shore, the two states also contested where the off-shore boundary between the two states is located. The typical procedure would be to locate the mouth of the Savannah River and then draw a line perpendicular to the shore from the midpoint of the river's mouth. However, the river does not have a clearly defined mouth. Tybee Island forms the southern edge of its mouth, but there is no highlands on the opposite side. South Carolina claimed that a submerged shoal formed the north side of the mouth, while Georgia claimed that Hilton Head Island was the north side of the mouth. The issue is complicated by a bend in the Atlantic coast at this point with Georgia's coast about 20 degrees from true north and South Carolina's coast about 47 degrees from true north.497 U.S. at 406. A perpendicular line drawn from each of these angles results in an overlapping 27 degree wedge claimed by both states. In 1978, the Court appointed Walter E. Hoffman, Senior Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, as special master to gather the facts and make a recommendation.497 U.S. at 379. Opinion of the Court Justice Blackmun delivered a plurality opinion and held that the new island on the South Carolina side of the border belonged to that state rather than Georgia. Georgia had lost the right to that land through prescription and acquiescence. He also found that any new islands emerging after the border was drawn would not cause the border to automatically shift so as to place the island in Georgia. The Court also adopted Georgia's \\"triequidistant\\" method for determining the boundary around the existing islands, resulting in the border line curving around those islands.497 U.S. at 401-02. The Court awarded Denwill and Horseshoe Shoal to Georgia because its creation was \\"primarily avulsive in nature.\\" The Court also placed the newly emerged Bird Island in Georgia.497 U.S. at 405. The Court also set a compromise seaward boundary drawing it perpendicular to a line between Tybee Island and Hilton Head. Justice White, joined by Justice Marshall, dissented in part. They would draw the boundary at islands at right angles to the tips of the islands back to the middle of the river.497 U.S. at 411-12. Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Scalia, dissented from the seaward boundary portion of the opinion. This opinion would average the angles of the Georgia and South Carolina coast lines and draw the boundary at an azimuth of this boundary would be approximately 123 1/2 degrees. Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Kennedy, dissented from the Denwill and Horseshoe Shoal portion of the opinion and would place that land in South Carolina. Justice Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, dissented from the portions of the opinion finding that newly formed islands belong in whatever state has that portion of the river. Kennedy reads the Treaty as giving all islands to Georgia, so Kennedy would place them in Georgia unless they were lost by prescription and acquiescence. Accordingly, Kennedy agrees with the majority that the Barnwell Islands belong to South Carolina.497 U.S. at 416.

She also wrote a number of unpublished children‚Äôs stories. Early career In 1975, she founded the International Soundex Reunion Registry, Inc. (ISRR) as a free mutual consent registry serving adoptees, foster children and others separated from birth family. This registry was supported by Emma and her husband Tony for many years. They saved all the donations until they were able to purchase the first computer and then the building in Carson City, Nevada which housed the registry until 2007. Emma was survived by her husband, son Ed, sister Pat and many nieces, nephews and grandchildren. In addition, Emma served as a mentor to many, with her expertise in genealogy research utilized to assist persons seeking reunion with family from whom they had been separated. She served on the planning committees which created the American Adoption Congress (AAC) and was an original signer to the 1981 incorporation. She was also involved in and served on the advisory board of TRIADOPTION Library and other movement organizations.

The Second Republic was founded on the Syrian Constitution of 1950, which was suspended from 1953 to 1954 under Adib Shishakli's strongmanship, and later when Syria joined with the Republic of Egypt in forming the United Arab Republic in 1958. The Second Republic resumed when Syria withdrew from the union in 1961. In 1963, the Syrian Ba'athist Party came to power in a bloody military coup, which laid foundations for the political structure in Syria for the next decades. The green, white, black and red flag is the first flag of the Syrian Arab Republic and with the shortest usage, that being from 1961 to 1963. Background =Mandatory Syrian Republic (1930‚Äì1946)= Constitution of the Syrian Republic, 14 May 1930 The project of a new constitution was discussed by a Constituent Assembly elected in April 1928, but as the pro-independence National Bloc had won a majority and insisted on the insertion of several articles \\"that did not preserve the prerogatives of the mandatary power\\", the Assembly was dissolved on August 9, 1928. On May 14, 1930, the State of Syria was declared the Republic of Syria and a new Syrian constitution was promulgated by the French High Commissioner, in the same time as the Lebanese Constitution, the R√®glement du Sandjak d'Alexandrette, the Statute of the Alawi Government, the Statute of the Jabal Druze State.Youssef Takla, \\"Corpus juris du Mandat fran√ßais\\", in: A new flag was also mentioned in this constitution: :The Syrian flag shall be composed as follows, the length shall be double the height. It shall contain three bands of equal dimensions, the upper band being green, the middle band white, and the lower band black. The white portion shall bear three red stars in line, having five points each.\\"\\", article 4 of the Constitution de l'Etat de Syrie, 14 May 1930The 1930 Constitution is integrally reproduced in: During December 1931 and January 1932, the first elections under the new constitution were held, under an electoral law providing for \\"the representation of religious minorities\\" as imposed by article 37 of the constitution. The National Bloc was in the minority in the new Chamber of deputies with only 16 deputies out of 70, due to intensive vote-rigging by the French authorities. Among the deputies were also three members of the Syrian Kurdish nationalist Xoyb√ªn (Khoyboun) party, Khalil bey Ibn Ibrahim Pacha (Al-Jazira province), Mustafa bey Ibn Shahin (Jarabulus) and Hassan Aouni (Kurd Dagh). There were later in the year, from March 30 to April 6, \\"complementary elections\\". In 1933, France attempted to impose a treaty of independence heavily prejudiced in favor of France. It promised gradual independence but kept the Syrian Mountains under French control. The Syrian head of state at the time was a French puppet, Muhammad 'Ali Bay al-'Abid. Fierce opposition to this treaty was spearheaded by senior nationalist and parliamentarian Hashim al-Atassi, who called for a sixty-day strike in protest. Atassi's political coalition, the National Bloc, mobilized massive popular support for his call. Riots and demonstrations raged, and the economy came to a standstill. After negotiations in March with Damien de Martel, the French High Commissioner in Syria, Hashim al-Atassi went to Paris heading a senior Bloc delegation. The new Popular Front-led French government, formed in June 1936 after the April‚ÄìMay elections, had agreed to recognize the National Bloc as the sole legitimate representatives of the Syrian people and invited al-Atassi to independence negotiations. The resulting treaty called for immediate recognition of Syrian independence as a sovereign republic, with full emancipation granted gradually over a 25-year period. In 1936, the Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence was signed, a treaty that would not be ratified by the French legislature. However, the treaty allowed Jabal Druze, the Alawite region (now called Latakia), and Alexandretta to be incorporated into the Syrian republic within the following two years. Greater Lebanon (now the Lebanese Republic) was the only state that did not join the Syrian Republic. Hashim al-Atassi, who was Prime Minister during King Faisal's brief reign (1918‚Äì1920), was the first president to be elected under a new constitution adopted after the independence treaty. The treaty guaranteed incorporation of previously autonomous Druze and Alawite regions into Greater Syria, but not Lebanon, with which France signed a similar treaty in November. The treaty also promised curtailment of French intervention in Syrian domestic affairs as well as a reduction of French troops, personnel and military bases in Syria. In return, Syria pledged to support France in times of war, including the use of its air space, and to allow France to maintain two military bases on Syrian territory. Other political, economic and cultural provisions were included. Atassi returned to Syria in triumph on September 27, 1936 and was elected President of the Republic in November. In September 1938, France again separated the Syrian Sanjak of Alexandretta and transformed it into the State of Hatay. The State of Hatay joined Turkey in the following year, in June 1939. Syria did not recognize the incorporation of Hatay into Turkey and the issue is still disputed until the present time. The emerging threat of Adolf Hitler induced a fear of being outflanked by Nazi Germany if France relinquished its colonies in the Middle East. That, coupled with lingering imperialist inclinations in some levels of the French government, led France to reconsider its promises and refuse to ratify the treaty. Also, France ceded the Sanjak of Alexandretta, whose territory was guaranteed as part of Syria in the treaty, to Turkey. Riots again broke out, Atassi resigned, and Syrian independence was deferred until after World War II. With the fall of France in 1940 during World War II, Syria came under the control of the Vichy Government until the British and Free French invaded and occupied the country in July 1941. Syria proclaimed its independence again in 1941 but it wasn't until 1 January 1944, that it was recognized as an independent republic. In the 1940s, Britain secretly advocated the creation of a Greater Syrian state that would secure Britain preferential status in military, economic and cultural matters, in return for putting a complete halt to Jewish ambition in Palestine. France and the United States opposed British hegemony in the region, which eventually led to the creation of Israel.https://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/spages/950373.html On 27 September 1941, France proclaimed, by virtue of, and within the framework of the Mandate, the independence and sovereignty of the Syrian State. The proclamation said \\"the independence and sovereignty of Syria and Lebanon will not affect the juridical situation as it results from the Mandate Act. Indeed, this situation could be changed only with the agreement of the Council of the League of Nations, with the consent of the Government of the United States, a signatory of the Franco-American Convention of April 4, 1924, and only after the conclusion between the French Government and the Syrian and Lebanese Governments of treaties duly ratified in accordance with the laws of the French Republic.See Foreign relations of the United States diplomatic papers, 1941. The British Commonwealth; the Near East and Africa Volume III (1941), pages 809-810; and Statement of General de Gaulle of November 29, 1941, concerning the Mandate for Syria and Lebanon, Marjorie M. Whiteman, Digest of International Law, vol. 1 (Washington, D.C.: U. S. Government Printing Office, 1963) 680-681 Benqt Broms said that it was important to note that there were several founding members of the United Nations whose statehood was doubtful at the time of the San Francisco Conference and that the Government of France still considered Syria and Lebanon to be mandates.See International law: achievements and prospects, by Mohammed Bedjaoui, UNESCO, Martinus Nijhoff; 1991, , page 46 Duncan Hall said \\"Thus, the Syrian mandate may be said to have been terminated without any formal action on the part of the League or its successor. The mandate was terminated by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in formal admission to the United Nations. Article 78 of the Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state: 'The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality.'\\"Mandates, Dependencies and Trusteeship, by H. Duncan Hall, Carnegie Endowment, 1948, pages 265-266 So when the UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the United Nations Charter by the five permanent members, as both Syria and Lebanon were founding member states, the French mandate for both was legally terminated on that date and full independence attained. On 29 May 1945, France bombed Damascus and tried to arrest its democratically elected leaders. While French planes were bombing Damascus, Prime Minister Faris al-Khoury was at the founding conference of the United Nations in San Francisco, presenting Syria's claim for independence from the French Mandate. 1945 early Syrian Republic consular visa from the US. Syrian independence was attained on 24 October 1945, with recognition of the international community. Continuing pressure from Syrian nationalist groups and British pressure forced the French to evacuate their last troops on 17 April 1946. Although rapid economic development followed the declaration of independence, Syrian politics from independence through the late 1960s was marked by upheaval. =Independent First Syrian Republic (1946‚Äì1950)= The early years of independence were marked by political instability. From 1946 to 1956, Syria had 20 different cabinets and drafted four separate constitutions. In 1948, Syria was involved in the Arab-Israeli War with the newly created State of Israel. The Syrian army was pressed out of the Israeli areas, but fortified their strongholds on the Golan Heights and managed to keep their old borders and occupy some additional territory. In July 1949, Syria was the last Arab country to sign an armistice agreement with Israel. History =Early years= On 29 March 1949, Syria's national government was overthrown by a military coup d'√©tat led by Hussni al-Zaim. The cause of this coup was the shame that the Syrian Army experienced following the Arab-Israeli War. An example of this shame can be seen in what we will call the Samneh Scandal of 1948. According to Patrick Seale, \\"President Shukri al-Quwatli and his new Prime Minister set off on a tour of front-line positions and supply points. The story has it that the two politicians noticed a pungent smell coming from a field kitchen. On making inquiries they were told that it came from burning cooking fat. Quwatli demanded that a new tin be opened and an egg cooked before him. The fat once more gave off a nauseating smell: the President tasted it and pronounced it of inferior quality. Samples were sent for testing and revealed that the fat was made from bone waste\\". Afterwards, Quwatli ordered the arrest of colonel for profiteering. Following this incident, officers became enraged when the common folk held their noses at them, a reference to the smell of the cooking fat. On 14 August 1949, Zaim was overthrown by his colleague Sami al-Hinnawi. A few months later, in December 1949, Hinnawi was overthrown by Colonel Adib al-Shishakli. The latter undermined civilian rule and led to Shishakli's complete seizure of power in 1951. Shishakli continued to rule the country until 1954, when growing public opposition forced him to resign and leave the country. The national government was restored, but again to face instability, this time coming from abroad. After the overthrow of President Shishakli in the February 1954 coup, continued political maneuvering supported by competing factions in the military eventually brought Arab nationalist and socialist elements to power. During the Suez Crisis of 1956, after the invasion of the Sinai Peninsula by Israeli troops, and the intervention of British and French troops, martial law was declared in Syria. Later Syrian and Iraqi troops were brought into Jordan to prevent a possible Israeli invasion. The November 1956 attacks on Iraqi pipelines were in retaliation for Iraq's acceptance into the Baghdad Pact. In early 1957, Iraq advised Egypt and Syria against a conceivable takeover of Jordan. In November 1956, Syria signed a pact with the Soviet Union, providing a foothold for Communist influence within the government in exchange for planes, tanks, and other military equipment being sent to Syria. This increase in the strength of Syrian military technology worried Turkey, as it seemed feasible that Syria might attempt to retake Iskenderon, a formerly Syrian city now in Turkey. On the other hand, Syria and the USSR accused Turkey of massing its troops at the Syrian border. During this standoff, Communists gained more control over the Syrian government and military. Only heated debates in the United Nations (of which Syria was an original member) lessened the threat of war. =Joining the United Arab Republic= Syria's political instability during the years after the 1954 coup, the parallelism of Syrian and Egyptian policies, and the appeal of Egyptian President Gamal Abdal Nasser's leadership in the wake of the Suez crisis created support in Syria for union with Egypt. On February 1, 1958, Syrian president Shukri al-Kuwatli and Nasser announced the merging of the two countries, creating the United Arab Republic, and all Syrian political parties, as well as the Communists therein, ceased overt activities. The merger was approved in a 1958 referendum. =1961‚Äì1963= Discontent with Egyptian dominance of the UAR led elements opposed to the union under Abd al-Karim al-Nahlawi to seize power on 28 September 1961. Two days later, Syria re-established itself as the Syrian Arab Republic. Frequent coups, military revolts, civil disorders and bloody riots characterized the 1960s. The 8 March 1963 coup resulted in installation of the National Council of the Revolutionary Command (NCRC), a group of military and civilian officials who assumed control of all executive and legislative authority. The takeover was engineered by members of the Ba'ath Party led by Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar. The new cabinet was dominated by Ba'ath members; the moderate al-Bitar became premier.

Dehlsen (born April 27, 1937) is an American businessman, inventor, and entrepreneur. He is a pioneering figure in wind power and renewable energy development in the United States and holds 25 patents. Early life and career Dehlsen was born in Guadalajara, Mexico. His father was a Danish businessman and engineer who worked for Southern Pacific Railroad. As a young man, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Dehlsen subsequently earned a BS and MBA from the University of Southern California. Dehlsen developed a fluid lubricant called Tri-Flon which utilized micron-sized Teflon particles. He sold the company in 1980. Windpower and renewable energy career =Zond= In 1980, Dehlsen founded the wind power company Zond Systems Inc., which became the first company to commercially provide wind power to Southern California Edison. Dehlsen collaborated with the Danish company Vestas, from which Zond purchased wind turbines. During the 1980s, Zond purchased nearly all the turbines Vestas produced. As a result, \\"California became the birthplace of the modern wind industry.\\" In the 1990s, Zond began manufacturing its own wind turbines in order further lower the cost of energy. With support from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the U.S. Department of Energy, Zond produced a 550kW turbine. Zond's work on variable- speed technology subsequently enabled turbine scaling to 1.5MW. In 1997, Enron acquired Zond and formed Enron Wind. GE subsequently acquired Enron Wind in 2002 to form GE Wind Energy. =Clipper Windpower= In 2001, Dehlsen and his son James Brenton (\\"Brent\\") established Clipper Windpower. In partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy and NREL, the company developed the 2.5-MW Liberty Wind Turbine, featuring advanced drive train and controls architecture. Commercial sales for the Liberty Wind Turbine began in 2006, then the largest wind turbine manufactured in the United States. Clipper's IPO on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange launched in September 2005. In 2007, the U.S. Department of Energy bestowed on Clipper its \\"Outstanding Research and Development Partnership Award\\" for its \\"outstanding contribution toward industry advancements,\\" including attaining \\"unparalleled levels of efficiency and reliability and reduced cost of energy\\" with the Liberty Wind Turbine. Clipper also worked on developing offshore wind power. In 2007, the company began design and development of the 10MW, 150m rotor \\"Britannia\\" offshore wind turbine in the United Kingdom. In December 2009, United Technologies Corporation (UTC) announced it was acquiring a 49.5% stake in Clipper Windpower. By December 2010, UTC had acquired the rest of the company. =Aquantis= Dehlsen has worked on developing marine renewable energy. In 2011, he established Aquantis, which has developed underwater turbine technology to harness marine currents for utility-scale electric power generation. The company is headquartered in Santa Barbara, California. Aquantis has received U.S. Department of Energy grants and venture capital from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Dehlsen is also developing wave energy electric generators through his \\"Centipod\\" program.

Prior to 1914, anti-militarism had been an article of faith among most European socialist parties. Leaders of the Second International had even suggested that socialist workers might foil a declaration of war by means of a general strike. However, when war broke out in August 1914, the leaders of most European socialist parties rallied to the support of their respective countries, while a minority continued to oppose the war. Those in favour of their country's war efforts were variously called 'social patriots' or 'defencists'. Those opposed to the war called themselves 'Internationalists' and were often called 'defeatists' by their opponents.  Division  The 'defencist' camp included many venerable figures of European socialism: Jules Guesde and √âdouard Vaillant in France, Gustav Noske and Friedrich Ebert in Germany, Georgi Plekhanov and Ekaterina Breshkovskaia among the Russians. Leaders of the anti-war 'Internationalist' camp included Jean Jaur√®s (who was murdered for his anti-war stance in 1914), Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, and later also Karl Kautsky and Eduard Bernstein, in Germany, Iulii Martov, Vladimir Lenin, Viktor Chernov and Mark Natanson among the Russians. The anti- war socialists held two international conferences at Zimmerwald and Kienthal in Switzerland in 1915 and 1916. The defencist‚Äìinternationalist schism did not necessarily coincide with earlier, pre-existing splits, such as that between reformists and revolutionaries, Revisionists and orthodox Marxists, Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, etc. For example, Guesde and Vaillant in France had belonged to the intransigent, revolutionary left of the Socialist Party, and in 1914, anti-war sentiment was strongest on the far left. Yet both of these veterans were ardent supporters of the French war effort, while the old reformist leader Jaur√®s opposed the war. Likewise, Kautsky and Bernstein had been on opposite sides during the Revisionism controversy of the 1890s, Kautsky defending orthodox Marxism and Bernstein being the principal exponent of Revisionism; they both joined the anti-war faction. Meanwhile the left wing Marxists Paul Lensch, Heinrich Cunow and Konrad Haenisch went on to form the Lensch-Cunow-Haenisch group, which argued that the First World War was a revolutionary war against the liberal capitalism of the Triple Entente. 'Defencism' and 'Internationalism' were broad categories; within each camp, there were further differences and divisions. Out-and-out 'Social Patriots' who supported their countries' war efforts unconditionally, including territorial ambitions, were fairly rare, though they included some of the most prominent representatives of the pre-war socialist movement: people like Henry Hyndman, Plekhanov and Guesde. More common was an attitude of conditional support for the war, approving a 'defensive' war but rejecting annexations and indemnities. A special case arose in Russia in 1917: After the February Revolution, several Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries (SRs) who had previously been Internationalists and Zimmerwaldists now favoured 'Revolutionary Defencism' ‚Äì continued war effort in defence of the revolution. This was the case with Mensheviks like Fedor Dan and Irakli Tsereteli, SRs like Avram Gots and Nikolai Avksentiev and Trudoviks like Alexander Kerensky. In 1917 some Bolsheviks took also this position, before Lenin returned to Russia and successfully opposed this view. On the Internationalist side, too, there were divisions. Most Internationalists favoured passive resistance to the war and called for an international peace agreement, 'without annexations or indemnities'. Jaur√®s, Kautsky, Bernstein, Martov and Chernov belonged to this camp; so, at first, did the Bolshevik Lev Kamenev. A minority led by Lenin advocated 'Revolutionary Defeatism': instead of seeking a peace agreement that would restore the status quo ante, socialists should seek to convert the 'imperialist war' into a revolutionary 'civil war', with each socialist party working for the defeat of its own country.  Effects by country  The schism caused splits in many European socialist parties. In France, the split between socialists and communists did not occur until 1920. In Germany, the Independent Social-Democrats (USPD) formally separated from the majority Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1917, and the more radical Spartacist League formed the nucleus of the post-war German Communist Party (KPD). Italy was a special case: whereas, in most European socialist parties, Defencists predominated (at least at the beginning of the war), in Italy, the majority of the members and most of the leaders of the Socialist Party, from reformists to radicals, were against Italy's entry into the war, while a minority, led by the former Maximalist and future fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, campaigned for Italian intervention and was expelled from the party for it. Only the Serbian socialists remained fairly uniformly anti- war. = Russia = Divisions in Russia were especially complicated and affected party alignments during the Russian Revolution. The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries were badly divided. A small minority on the right took an out-and-out Social Patriotic stance, even supporting territorial expansion as a war aim. Plekhanov and the 'Grandmother of the Revolution, Breshkovskaia, belonged to this group. Slightly more moderate were Mensheviks like Aleksandr Potresov and SRs like Vadim Rudnev. The Menshevik and SR majority, including Dan, Tsereteli, Abramovich, Liber, Gots, Avksentiev, Zenzinov and so on, were 'Revolutionary Defencists'; they had been Zimmerwaldists and opponents of the war until February 1917 but now favoured limited defensive war. Some later returned to the Internationalist camp (such as Dan and Abramovich). The Revolutionary Defencists dominated the soviets and the Provisional Government until the October Revolution of 1917. The Menshevik/SR Revolutionary Defencists in the soviet supported the Provisional Government, but with increasing misgivings. Kerensky had been one of them, a Zimmerwaldist until 1917, then a Revolutionary Defencist; however, as, initially, the only socialist in the Provisional Government, he had adopted a more and more unqualified stance in support of the war, in line with his liberal colleagues. To the left of the revolutionary defencists stood Internationalists like Chernov, who collaborated with the soviet leaders and even joined the Provisional Government, although he opposed both a continuation of the war and a coalition with the liberals. More principled in his opposition to the war was the Menshevik Internationalist leader Martov, who, however, was in a minority in his party until the Bolsheviks had taken power. The Mezhraiontsy group, headed by Leon Trotsky, was firmly internationalist but not necessarily revolutionary defeatist; in 1918, Trotsky resigned his ministry rather than sign the harsh peace agreement of Brest- Litovsk proposed by the Germans. The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who counted the veteran Mark Natanson and many young militants among their number, were also firmly Internationalist but broke their short-lived coalition with the Bolsheviks when the latter signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The Bolsheviks were fairly united in opposing the war, but not all Bolsheviks were comfortable with Lenin's Revolutionary Defeatism. Before Lenin's return to Russia, Joseph Stalin had even briefly adopted a Revolutionary Defencist position. Divisions over the war vitiated the attempts occasionally made, both before and after the October Revolution, to set up an all-socialist government, from the Bolsheviks to the Popular Socialists.  Post-war impact  After World War I was over, divisions over the war could not be healed. Many internationalists wanted nothing to do with the Defencist leaders of the old Second International. Some affiliated with Lenin's communist Third International. A minority, who opposed both communism and the Second International leadership, formed the International Working Union of Socialist Parties, based in Vienna and known as the 'Second-and-a-Half International'. This included many former Internationalists, German Independent Social- Democrats like Rudolf Hilferding, Austro-Marxists like Max and Friedrich Adler, Mensheviks like Dan, centre-left SRs like Chernov and the Left SRs. Eventually this third camp dissolved; some rejoined the majority socialist parties of their countries, others the communists. The split between Defencists and Internationalists continued to fester, however, until the Second World War was on the horizon. A belated echo of the split was the division among French socialists in the late 1930s over what attitude to take if Hitler invaded Poland. Most French socialists were firmly anti-fascist; though none contemplated the prospect of another war with Germany with joy, they were prepared to take that step if Germany attacked Poland. A minority, however, wanted to maintain peace at any cost. Some were motivated by unconditional pacifism, others by fascist sympathies which subsequently manifested themselves, as in the case of the ex-socialist and future premier of the Vichy r√©gime, Pierre Laval.

He was a living sand doppelganger of Superman and first appeared in Superman (vol. 1) # 233 (January 1971) in \\"The Sandman Saga\\", the first issue that introduced the Bronze Age-era Superman. Fictional origin Somewhere in the deserts of the United States there was a reactor in which experiments were conducted on pieces of kryptonite. When a powerful nuclear meltdown happened, Superman himself was there to attempt to stop it. He failed, however, and a powerful kryptonite-based explosion that rendered Superman unconscious resulted. Although he apparently had succeeded in stopping most of the deadly radiation from reaching humanity, a strange fission wave reached around the world and changed all kryptonite into pure iron. Miraculously, it seemed, Superman now had no vulnerabilities anymore, a fact that was told in newspapers worldwide. On the spot Superman had been lying in the desert unconscious after the explosion was formed the imprint of the Man of Steel. The explosion had mysteriously opened up a portal into another dimension called the Quarrm Dimension. In that dimension beings existed as non-corporeal spirits and, like most spirits, they wanted a physical form to accompany them. One of the beings of that dimension gained access to the ordinary DC Earth by attaching itself to the psychic and physical imprint of Superman left in the sand. Many hours after the explosion an uncanny version of Superman, made of sand, rose from the imprint. This being would in the months that followed meet Superman seemingly randomly and drain power from him in an attempt to create an identity for itself. Superman was left near powerless after each such encounter, while the Sand Superman grew more and more powerful and humanoid. Its presence became more and more of an annoyance to Superman, who wanted to know what it was. It could, however not speak, and mostly left more mysterious than it had been before the encounter. Superman, powerless at those occasions, was unable to follow it. During one of these encounters, it saved the life of Superman by destroying the magic weapon called the Devil's Harp, an artifact that was being used by a man named Ferlin Nyxly a.k.a. Pan. Pan had nearly killed Superman when the Sand Superman sneaked by and destroyed the weapon that had allowed Pan to steal all of Superman's powers. Reasonably, the Sand Superman saved Superman's life in order to maintain its own existence (it had a life-giving mental link to Superman and thus it could not survive without Superman being alive). Later it gained the ability to speak, but that did not help Superman much. The being did not follow human emotions and did not care for humanity; thus Superman could not convince it to agree on anything. When the situation got even worse, Superman was left completely without powers. Seeking help from one of Wonder Woman's old friends, the Asian mystic called I Ching, Superman hoped to cure his situation. I Ching sent away Superman's soul to regain all the powers he had lost, which it did, leaving the Sand Superman powerless and near dead. Attempting to return home to Quarrm in order to survive, the Sand Superman opened up a dimensional portal in a park in Metropolis. Superman was too weak to enter the portal. The portal remained open. Superman had, unfortunately, been given brain damage by a powerful blow to his head while un-powered. When his powers had now returned he retained the brain damage, which made him act rashly and unreasonably. Superman had now become an irresponsible and potentially lethal superbeing. With kryptonite no longer available, I Ching and Wonder Woman had to decide on a risky plan to help Superman; they tracked down the Sand Superman and made an agreement with Superman to meet him so that the Sand Superman could ambush it, draining all his powers. Powerless, Superman would then recover as a normal man. Before the Sand Superman could steal Superman's powers, it was spotted and Superman escaped the scene. Meanwhile, another being from Quarrm had entered the Earth Dimension via the portage in the park. This being fused itself with a giant Chinese statue of a monster and began rampaging in the streets. Superman accidentally flew over this creature and was completely drained of power, leaving him unconscious and powerless. Some street punks found Superman, gave him a real beating and allied themselves with the Chinese monster Quarrmian. The monster, seeking advice, did everything the punks asked of it. They wanted to finish off Superman, who was now residing in a hospital, and thus went there sitting on the back of the monster. The punks were, however, too bullying and the enraged monster killed both of them, crushing them in its hands. The monster still wanted to finish Superman (to which he also seemed to have a mental link), but by the time it reached the hospital, Superman awoke re-powered. The Sand Superman showed up and teamed with Superman. Together they both attacked the monster who, terrified, escaped back to the park and left Earth via the dimensional portal. Alone again with Superman, the Sand Superman announced that he was going to kill Superman so that he could be the only Man of Steel (see Quote). I Ching, fortunately, arrived on the scene and magically hypnotized both into seeing how a fight between the two might turn out. Both saw the fight destroying Earth and Superman, believing that he had really destroyed Earth, was devastated. The Sand Superman realized that it had no right to claim Superman's body or soul and thus agreed to return home to Quarrm. It left through the portage with half of Superman's powers (Superman refused to take the other half back after having seen the destruction of Earth during the hypnotism) and closed the portal from the Quarrm side. Long after that, he was seen in an issue of DC Collector's Edition: Superman vs. Shazam. The Sand Superman was impersonating the real Man of Steel and attacked Captain Marvel, while Black Adam pretended to be Marvel and ambushed Superman, all to bring about a battle between the two heroes. Presumably the Sand Superman returned to the Quarrm Dimension after the matter was settled. He has probably not been seen since. After this history, more kryptonite rained down on Earth later on, so the effect was only temporary. Description The Sand Superman resembled Superman himself more and more the more power it absorbed. At first it was a pile of sand with humanoid features, but near the end it had acquired colors in its densely packed sand so that it really resembled Superman. The only real difference was that the Sand Superman had a very different and alien body language and that his skin and suit resembled rough sandpaper. Everywhere Superman had colors in his suit, it had too; it even had blue eyes of blue sand and black sand for hair. The entire appearance was quite uncanny and people who saw it often commented how strange 'Superman' looked. All in all, it had the exact appearance of Superman himself, but with a very sand-like composition. The Sand Superman's personality is very strange and alien. Its main driving force seemed to be pure survival, for which it would do anything. In time it had also gotten some of Superman's own personality, including the desire to help humans and be a hero. It desired uniqueness nearly as much as survival itself, and would in the end kill Superman (something Superman would not do) to take his place. In speech it was sometimes very aggressive, intimidating, while other times it could be filled with self-pitying (particularly if powerless). It was very stoic and never showed any human emotion. Its logic was non-human and uncomprehensive. While claiming that it wanted to take Superman's place, it did not really care about what happened to humans or Earth. Only the final realization of what was right and what was wrong led it to leave Earth and its claims to be Superman. Since it has not returned from Quarrm, it has also shown a great belief in its judgement and a great persistence. Inspiration Back in 1971, DC heralded a big change coming to the Superman comics, and it was Denny O'Neil who would be penning the newest chapter in the Man of Steel's history. The idea was to strip Superman of some of his power, humanizing him in the process and allowing for a new level of \\"realistic\\" (relatively speaking) storytelling. His story, which kicked off with \\"Kryptonite Nevermore\\", but which has been nicknamed \\"The Sandman Saga\\", is about to be published as a hardcover edition by DC. The result of the fight between Superman and the Quarmer implies that the Man of Steel was devoid of half of his power, but later writers would gradually reintroduce Superman's Silver Age powers. This fallacy could imply other Kryptonian characters, such as Krypto and Supergirl, could have also infinite power and not similar but minor power levels in relation to Superman. Powers and abilities The Quarmer could drain and make use of Superman's powers, gradually becoming a Superman clone. He also could sense the whereabouts of Superman.

Published as one volume in August 1894 by Heinemann, The Manxman ended the outdated system of three-volume novels. A highly popular novel of its period, it was set in the Isle of Man and concerned a romantic triangle. The novel has as its central themes, the mounting consequences of sin and the saving grace of simple human goodness.Hall Caine, Preface to the 1903 edition of the novelA Library of the World's Best Literature ‚Äì Ancient and Modern ‚Äì Vol. VII, p. 3067 (1896) Plot summary ;Part I: The novel concerns the love triangle between Kate Cregeen and the two good friends and cousins, the illegitimate, poorly educated but good-hearted Peter Quilliam, and the well-educated and cultured Philip Christian. Kate's father rejects Pete's request to marry his daughter, due to his low prospects, and so Pete sets off to Kimberly, South Africa, to earn his fortune. He leaves Philip in charge of looking after Kate in his absence. ;Part II: As Kate matures into an adult woman and Philip rises to become the foremost young lawyer in the island, they begin to fall in love. This is first openly spoken of between them when they hear rumours that Pete has died in Africa. However, the course of their love is still not open as Philip has to choose between worldly success and the position as Deemster, or his love of the lower class Kate. Feeling this push them apart, Kate \\"is driven to an effort to hold on to the man whom life is tearing away from her by making a mistaken appeal to his love.\\" ;Part III: Pete returns to the island with a fortune fit to have his marriage proposal accepted by Kate's parents, while Kate is bed-ridden recovering from an illness brought about by Philip's breaking with her to stay true to his promise to Pete. Remaining unaware of anything between Philip and Kate, Pete arranges for the wedding, which Kate goes through with in a confused daze. Ramsey harbour not long after the time that Hall Caine wrote The Manxman ;Part IV: Kate gives birth to a daughter which she realises is Philip‚Äôs. This fact, along with the reason for Kate's displeasure at the marriage, remains hidden to Pete, who proves himself to be a good and doting husband. When Kate informs Philip of the paternity of the baby girl, they arrange for her to live with him in secret. She leaves Pete's house to go to Philip on the evening when Pete is at the head of the crowd honouring Philip on his return to Ramsey, having been made Deemster. ;Part V: Heart-broken at the disappearance of Kate, Pete looks to keep her memory in honour by pretending that she has gone to Liverpool to stay with a fictional uncle. To maintain this lie against the gossip of the town, Pete multiplies his lies in beginning to fake a written correspondence between Kate and himself. As Philip watches his friend's pathetic pretence, he feels the weight of his deceit, which causes him to take to drink and to pull away from Kate who has been secretly installed in his house. This situation continues until Kate leaves Philip so that he is relieved of his wretched situation. ;Part VI: With Pete's fortune used up, his deception with the letters is found out and Kate is universally thought of as a fallen woman by everyone but Pete. Meanwhile, the child falls sick, the news of which reaches Kate where she had fled, in London. She returns to see the child where she again meets Pete before throwing herself into the harbour, attempting to end her shameful life. However, she is saved and immediately brought before the Deemster, Philip, to be tried. Philip realises who she is as he commits her to the prison in Castletown, and then faints. Whilst still in a swoon he is taken to Pete's house, where Pete hears Philip's feverish and unconscious confessions. However, instead of wreaking vengeance on Philip and Kate, Pete \\"realises that he alone is the person in the way, and therefore wipes himself out in order that the woman he loves may be happy.\\" So Pete determines to leave the island again, divorcing Kate before he goes and leaving Philip with the child and his best wishes. Philip then overcomes his final temptation, to take up the position of Governor, and confesses everything publicly and so unburdens himself. The final scene sees him retrieving Kate from prison to start life afresh. Style The novel is notable for its regular use of Manx dialect in speech. Peter Quilliam and the majority of the smaller characters in the novel speak in a colloquial manner unique to the Isle of Man, rendered truthfully in the novel through unusual spellings, unusual grammatical structure and even occasional Manx Gaelic words and phrases (all of which are explained in the text). An example of such a section of dialogue is as follows: :‚ÄúIs it wanting to get done with me, you are, Pete?‚Äù she said in a quavering voice. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs my black ‚Äì I can sell it for something ‚Äì it‚Äôs never been wore at me since I sat through the service.‚ÄùThe Manxman, Part VI ‚Äì Man and God, Chapter I, p. 360 Reception The Prime Minister, Lord Rosebery, who observed of the novel that \\"It will rank with the great works of English literature\\". The Manxman was one of Hall Caine's greatest successes, selling over half a million copies by 1913 and being translated into twelve languages.Stark p. 263 It was also the fourth-best selling book in the United States in 1895.Hackett, Alice Payne. Seventy Years of Best Sellers 1895‚Äì1965, p. 91 (1967) It was well received by critics and the public figures of the day. The Editor of The Scotsman called it \\"the most powerful story that has been written in the present generation. It is a work of genius.\\"Reviews of Hall Caine's novels quoted at the front of Hall Caine, Barbed Wire, London, The Readers Library, 1927 T. P. O'Connor wrote that \\"The author of The Manxman belongs to the great elect of literature.\\" This view was also shared by the Prime Minister, Lord Rosebery, who observed of the novel that \\"It will rank with the great works of English literature\\". It helped to establish the Isle of Man as one of the literary landscapes of Britain. Another contemporary of Caine's, the fellow novelist George Gissing however, thought it \\"very poor\\".Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.343. The novel created something of a sensation on the Isle of Man, though opinions on it were generally of outrage due to its apparent \\"courseness.\\" This reception was enjoyed by Caine's friend, the Manx national poet, T. E. Brown, as can be seen in his letters: > ‚ÄúThe island is all in a shiver about Hall Caine. 'Worse than Tess!' so they > say. Ladies can't admit that they read The Manxman.‚ÄùLetter from T.E. Brown > to S. T. Irwin, 29th April 1894 > \\"Take The Manxman as a rapture, not a reality. It is not Manx or anything > else that 'savours of the realty.'

The initial play, written by Wilson Barrett with the title The Manxman, saw its first performance in the Grand Theatre, Leeds, on 22 August 1894, only three weeks after the publication of the book. After a regional tour, the play opened in the Shaftesbury Theatre in London with Lewis Walker in the lead role. However, it was so poorly received by the public and critics alike that it only last 13 performances.Allen, pp. 235‚Äì237 On 5 March 1898 Wilson Barrett, Maud Jeffries along with their London company opened the play in Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney, Australia. After a correspondence with George Bernard Shaw, Hall Caine himself then wrote a second version of the play in collaboration with Louis N. Parker. This version of the play, entitled Pete: A Drama in Four Acts featured Parker and his wife in the lead roles and proved to be a popular success.Allen, pp. 235‚Äì237 In Australia Maud Williamson dramatised the novel as A Woman's Sin. The novel had two eponymous silent film adaptations. In 1917, George Loane Tucker directed the first version and in 1929 Alfred Hitchcock made the hit remake, his last fully silent film. Locations in the novel The principle locations in the novel include the following: * Ramsey ‚Äì The location of Pete and Kate's house, Philip's family home (in Ballure, which was considered to be distinct from Ramsey at the time of the novel), and most of the later action of the novel. * Sulby ‚Äì The location of the parental home of Kate, and most of early action in the novel. * Douglas ‚Äì The location of Philip's home in which he lives in secret with Kate (in Athol Street). * Peel ‚Äì The location of various scenes concerning Pete and his time as a sailor. * Tynwald ‚Äì The location of the confrontation between the sailors and the Governor, adjudicated by Philip (in Part V of the novel) * Castletown ‚Äì The location of Kate's incarceration, and Philip's final confession in the courthouse.

The film portrays the life of an aging gay man, who was a hustler in his youth, confronting old age, an empty life and a reversal of paying for sex. Plot  Pierre is a 58-year-old gay man who was a hustler in his youth. He is no longer considered desirable and now finds himself in the reverse position: He is the one paying for sex. He has trouble sleeping, has a coffee, and starts chain smoking. In the morning, he receives a visit from Marc, a young hustler. They have sex, but the joyless encounter ends quickly; Pierre has been HIV positive for 24 years and his various medications have affected his performance. Marc invites him to a drag club but Pierre rejects the offer because he would have to shave his mustache. Pierre later visits Jacques, a wealthy gay friend, who is married and has tax problems. They compare bargains on gigolos. Pierre brags that he has acquired the services of one young man for half the price that his friend paid. A trip to Pigalle for sex is curtailed because of Pierre's impotence problem. At his lawyer's, an old gay man, Pierre runs into a friend from many years ago, Paul, an ex con who has inherited money from his late lover Gaston, an ex-lover of Pierre. Paul, who was barely 17 years old when Pierre was in his prime, was having sex with the lawyer when Pierre arrived to invite him for lunch. At the restaurant, they compare crime stories: stealing things, doing time, etc. Pierre casually mentions that he used to cruise with Roland Barthes and later reflects on his now lost youth and good looks, commenting that then \\"Apart from sun, cock, and bars, nothing much interested me.\\" Toutoune, Pierre's former older lover and patron, 35 years older than him, died recently and Pierre had been hoping to inherit some money, but no will was found and he was swindled out of his inheritance by Toutoune's relatives. With a friend, he visits Toutoune's house looking for some artwork that was left to him. \\"What would make me happy? Nothing...\\" he says at one point, adding that a new young lover might do the trick. Pierre visits his psychotherapist and discusses his depression. The therapist shuts down the session just as Pierre gets going. Back home, Pierre worries that his medication, aside from warnings about liver trouble and other dangerous side effects, will make him lose his hair. Later, Pierre gives oral sex to a man who delivers his groceries, advises a young gigolo and visits his friend David. Finally he dresses in drag to visit a porn cinema with Marc.

They settled on a farm along the Grand River, outside what is now known as Cambridge, Ontario. Koenig began his career as a filmmaker in 1956 at the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). He directed and produced dozens of films over his 14 1/2-year career at the NFB, including Cosmic Zoom, Christopher's Movie Matin√©e and The Rise and Fall of the Great Lakes. Through his work as a director and producer, Koenig began experimenting with multimedia as an educational tool. He left NFB in 1969 and, with John Kemeny and George Kaczender, formed International Cinemedia Center where he produced films for Sesame Street and other educational clients in Canada and the United States. He relocated to Toronto in 1978 and transformed the company into Interactive Image Technologies in 1985, and began producing and distributing educational interactive videos. In 1992, the Ontario Government modified its high school curriculum to require the teaching of electronics. A call for proposals to provide a simulation software package to meet the required learning outcomes was issued, and Koenig‚Äôs company was awarded the contract. In 1995, Koenig became embroiled in a copyright lawsuit that gained international attention. He sued the operator of a website that distributed illegal copies of his software through a bulletin-board and was successful in his lawsuit, which was filed in the UK. One of the main challenges faced by early versions of Electronics Workbench, was the reluctance of educators to use simulation software as part of their electronics curriculum. In the early 1990s, there was considerable opposition among the electronics education community regarding the use of simulation software for the delivery of electronics curriculum. Many educators felt that a \\"hands on\\" methodology was the only valid method of learning electronics, and that simulation was a less- effective substitute. In 1996, Koenig approached best-selling author Dr. Colin Simpson, with the idea of integrating his simulation software with Simpson‚Äôs book Principles of Electronics and to offer an Electronics technician program where the entire learning outcomes for laboratory projects would be achieved with simulation. Simpson and Koenig embarked on a series of lectures, conference presentations and meetings with accrediting organizations throughout 1996, where they demonstrated that electronics simulation software could achieve identical results to laboratory experiments performed with real equipment.Popular Electronics Magazine, The New Virtual World of Electronics Laboratories, pp. 3-5, Gernsbeck Publishing, New York, October, 1996 The partnership between Koenig and Simpson led to the creation of the Electronics Technician distance education program,which became the largest electronics program in the world. The program won a National Award in 1998, and established Electronics Workbench as a leading educational resource. In 1999, Koenig oversaw the acquisition of Ultimate Technology Inc. (UTI) located in the Netherlands. The integration of Multisim with UTI‚Äôs PCB layout and design, transformed Koenig‚Äôs company into a global Electronic Design Automation (EDA) company with an installed base of over 150,000 customers. Later years By the year 2000, Koenig‚Äôs vision of laboratory simulation software in every school was largely realized and he began to take a more passive role in the strategic planning and day-to-day operation of his company. He announced his retirement as Chief Executive Officer in 2003, and in 2005, Koenig sold his company to National Instruments.

However, although Mishima took themes, titles and characters from the noh canon, he included his own twists and modern settings, such as hospitals and ballrooms, which startled audiences who were accustomed to the long-settled originals. In total, Mishima wrote 34 novels (including some entertainment novels), about 50 plays, 25 books of short stories, and at least 35 books of essays, one libretto, as well as one film.

As the Byzantine Empire's first and most important naval theme (Œ∏Œ≠ŒºŒ± ŒΩŒ±œÖœÑŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ, thema nautikon), it served chiefly to provide ships and troops for the Byzantine navy. History The Cibyrrhaeots (, \\"men of Cibyrrha\\") derive their name from the city of Cibyrrha (it is unclear whether this is Cibyrrha the Great in Caria or Cibyrrha the Lesser in Pamphylia). The command first appears in the expedition against Carthage in 698, when a \\"droungarios of the Cibyrrhaeots\\" is attested as commanding the men from Korykos: Apsimar, who at the head of a fleet revolt became emperor as Tiberios III (r. 698‚Äì705). At the time, the Cibyrrhaeots were subordinate to the great naval corps of the Karabisianoi.. After the Karabisianoi were disbanded (the exact date is disputed between and ), the Cibyrrhaeots were constituted as a regular theme, with its governing strategos first attested in 731/732. Until the 9th century, when the themes of the Aegean Sea and Samos were elevated from droungarios-level commands, the Cibyrrhaeot Theme was the only dedicated naval theme of the Empire. The theme encompassed the southern coast of Asia Minor (modern Turkey), from south of Miletus (which belonged to the Thracesian Theme) to the confines of the Arab borderlands in Cilicia, including the old Roman provinces of Caria, Lycia, Pamphylia and parts of Isauria, as well as the modern Dodecanese. Its geographical position made it the \\"front-line\\" theme facing the attacks of the Muslim fleets of the Levant and Egypt, and consequently the Cibyrrhaeots played a major role in the naval aspect of the Byzantine‚ÄìArab Wars. The land, which was known for its fertility, suffered from the frequent and devastating Arab raids, which largely depopulated the countryside except for the fortified cities and naval bases. Seal of Niketas, spatharokandidatos and chartoularios of the Cibyrrhaeots (10th/11th century) The seat of the strategos was most probably Attaleia. He drew an annual salary of 10 pounds of gold, and his overall rank in the imperial hierarchy was relatively low, but still senior to any other naval commander: twenty-fifth in the Taktikon Uspensky of 842/843, dropping to fifty-fifth in the Escorial Taktikon of 971‚Äì975. Like its other counterparts, the Cibyrrhaeot Theme was divided into droungoi and tourmai, and possessed the full array of typical thematic administrative positions. Among the most important subordinates of the strategos were the imperial ek prosopou at Syllaion, the droungarioi of Attaleia and Kos and the katepano who commanded the theme's Mardaites. These were the descendants of several thousand people transplanted from the area of Lebanon and settled there by Emperor Justinian II (r. 685‚Äì695 and 705‚Äì711) in the 680s to provide crews and marines for the fleet. In the early 9th century, the thematic fleet of the Cibyrrhaeots comprised 70 ships; and in the Cretan expedition of 911, the Cibyrrhaeot theme sent 31 warships ‚Äì 15 large dromons and 16 middle-sized pamphyloi ‚Äì with 6,000 oarsmen and 760 marines. Around the mid-11th century, as the Muslim naval threat subsided, the Byzantine provincial fleets began a precipitate decline: the fleet of the Cibyrrhaeots is last mentioned in the repulsion of a Rus' raid in 1043, and the theme became a purely civil province, headed by a krites and later by a doux. Most of its territory was lost to the Seljuk Turks after 1071, but partly recovered under Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081‚Äì1118). The rump theme was finally abolished by Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143‚Äì1180), and the remaining territory in Caria subordinated to the theme Mylasa and Melanoudion.

The magazine was originally sold on a pay-what-you-like basis. The Blizzard took its name from an eclectic Victorian Sunderland-based newspaper set up by Sidney Duncan, which ran for 12 issues and was established in 1893. Wilson, who also comes from Sunderland, wanted to replicate the eclectic nature of this publication. The Editor's Note, which began Issue Zero, set out the magazine's ethos as an alternative to that which was currently available in football media. Jonathan Wilson wrote: ::\\"I‚Äôd been frustrated for some time by the constraints of the mainstream media and, in various press-rooms and bars across the world, I‚Äôd come to realise I wasn‚Äôt the only one who felt journalism as a whole was missing something, that there should be more space for more in-depth pieces, for detailed reportage, history and analysis. Was there a way, I wondered, to accommodate articles of several thousand words? Could we do something that was neither magazine nor book, but somewhere in between? As I floated thoughts and theories to anyone who would listen, I became aware there were other writers so keen to break the shackles of Search Engine Optimisation and the culture of quotes-for-quotes‚Äô-sake that they were prepared to write for a share of potential profit, that the joy of writing what they wanted and felt was important outweighed the desire to be paid.\\" The Blizzard accommodates longer articles than a typical football magazine, with pieces up to 8000 words long. Topics are often more obscure and esoteric than other magazines, aiming to either cover little-explored components of football culture, or to take new perspectives on previously well explored issues. While the initial issue was published virtually, a limited print run was released. All subsequent issues have appeared both as pdfs, and in-print.

However, the public service on the Bradford system did not start until four days later. The Bradford system lasted the longest of all the UK's urban trolleybus systems.

Just before its closure, it also held the distinction of being the longest-lived surviving trolleybus system in the world, but with the Bradford closure that distinction passed to the Shanghai, China, trolleybus system, opened in 1914.\\"Shanghai Anniversary\\" (November‚ÄìDecember 2004).

The book details a change in the training of Heralds from essentially an apprenticeship such as experienced by Tylendel and Vanyel, to a school based system such as the one in Arrows of The Queen and Brightly Burning.http://www.mercedeslackey.com/books/collegium1.html Not all Heralds are in favor of this mainly citing lack of supervision as an objection. Plot Mag is an enslaved child working alongside other enslaved orphans in the bowels of a gemstone mine. The mine owner, Cole Peters, treats the children with casual brutality, and Mags, orphaned in his early childhood, has known no other life all the way up until a mysterious white horse stampedes into his life. This of course, is Dallen, his Companion, who assists Mags by bringing in another Herald to free him and the children. Their freedom comes on the heels of the arrest of Cole Peters, and Mags is flung into the fray of Haven as a Heraldic Trainee, with no notion of life outside of abject slavery. This, of course, left its scars, and Mags has both no idea of how to function in \\"normal\\" society, and no notion of why he so often winds up on the wrong end of trouble. His heavy accent and \\"stupidity\\" about such normal things leads to the King's Own taking him under his wing as a spy prot√©g√©, however, Mags lives in perpetual fear of the bad old days. This fear isn't unjustified, for it seems all of the Heralds are experiencing their own tumultuous changes, as they slowly abandon the old system of apprenticeships which Vanyel learned in, for one of a collegiate style such as what Herald Talia and Herald Elspeth experienced in the time of Arrows of the Queen. This switch is due to a sudden surge in the numbers of people Chosen, and the accompanying tremendous burdening of the Heraldic, Bardic, and Healer Collegium resources. The crowding is so intense, that Mags is forced to take a room in the Companion's stable. This, on top of his painful social ineptness, sets the stage for a confrontation between Mags and his detractors. Mags, who used to sleep in worse conditions, does not mind being out in the stables, and remains unaware of why so many others do. However, one Herald accuses him of bringing all manner of illicit goods into the room because of his lodging, and nearly attacks him before the Companions intervene. Because of Mags's upbringing he has few friends so he literally does not understand many things most people in the Collegium find to be the utmost of importance, however with Dallen's help he finds two true friends, Lena, a Bardic Trainee, and Bear, a Healer Trainee. All while this is happening, Mags is trained by the Kings Own in the art of spying, and is assigned to keep an eye on two 'dignitaries' and their retinue of bodyguards and underlings who are visiting and causing trouble. He is also visiting the Guard Archives, in an attempt to find out how he ended up orphaned and enslaved in the first place. There is a suspicion that Mags' parents may have been bandits themselves, a prospect that leaves Mags troubled and desperate to find the actual Guard reports. There, he discovers that Bear has been kidnapped by the supposed dignitaries, and is being kept hostage with a mad man. The dignitaries have been digging through the guard archives, and there they attack Bear who was doing the same thing for personal reasons. Mags ends up rescuing Bear and dispatching the guards.Foundation Mercedes Lacey References Fantasy novels Valdemar Universe 2008 novels ","title":"Foundation (Lackey novel)"},{"id":"31158650","text":"This is a comprehensive chronological list of governors of Chernigov Governorate.

Previously filmed in 1928, the sentimental Margaret Kennedy novel The Constant Nymph was sumptuously remade by Gaumont-British Picture Corporation in 1933. Victoria Hopper plays the title character, a rich, Belgian gamine named Tessa Sanger. The girl falls hopelessly in love with world-famous composer Lewis Dodd (Brian Aherne), who is so full of himself that he barely acknowledges Tessa's existence. As she looks on in quiet desperation, Dodd marries another woman, her cousin Florence (Leonora Corbett). It takes him nearly the entire picture to realize what a fool he's been, and that Tessa was the one girl for him all along‚Äîbut alas, it's too late. The Constant Nymph was remade by Warner Bros. in 1943, at which time all prints of the 1933 version were supposed to be destroyed, however, several prints did survive.

While some music is arranged so that the pages end at places where the musician can spare one hand to turn them, this is not always possible. A page-turner is often necessary for musicians who are playing complex pieces and prefer not to play from memory. A page-turner needs to be able to understand the musician's signals and follow the music to know when to turn the page, and to do so quickly and unobtrusively. Page-turners are sometimes acquaintances of the performer or members of the accompanying orchestra doing a favour. Professional page-turners are often freelance casual workers, not associated with any given concert hall or orchestra. Mechanical page-turners are also available, sometimes controlled by the musician via a foot pedal. Charles Hall√© is said to have invented the automatic page-turner.

He is venerated in Confucian temples as one of the Four Sages. Names Yan Hui is also known by his courtesy name Ziyuan and as Yan Yuan, a combination of his surname and courtesy name. He is also reverently referred to as Master Yan or Yanzi. Life Yan Hui was a native of the state of Lu. His father Yan Wuyou (Yan Lu) was one of the earliest disciples of Confucius. Yan Hui was about 30 years younger than Confucius, and became a student of the Master at a young age. Yan Hui was Confucius' favorite disciple. \\"After I got Yan Hui,\\" Confucius remarked, \\"the disciples came closer to me.\\" We are told that once, when he found himself on the Nang hill with Yan Hui, Zilu, and Zigong, Confucius asked them to tell him their different aims, and he would choose between them. Zilu began, and when he had done, the master said, \\"It marks your bravery.\\" Zigong followed, on whose words the judgment was, \\"They show your discriminating eloquence.\\" At last came Yan Hui, who said, \\"I should like to find an intelligent king and sage ruler whom I might assist. I would diffuse among the people instructions on the five great points, and lead them on by the rules of propriety and music, so that they should not care to fortify their cities by walls and moats, but would fuse their swords and spears into implements of agriculture. They should send forth their flocks without fear into the plains and forests. There should be no sunderings of families, no widows or widowers. For a thousand years there would be no calamity of war. Yu would have no opportunity to display his bravery, or Ts'ze to display his oratory.\\" The master pronounced, \\"How admirable is this virtue!\\" Death When Yan Hui was twenty-nine, his hair was all white. He died at an early age. After the death of Yan Hui, Confucius lamented, \\"Heaven has bereft me! Heaven has bereft me!\\". When told by other students that he was showing \\"excessive grief\\", the old philosopher replied: \\"Am I showing excessive grief? Well, for whom would I show excessive grief if not for this man?\\". Even years later, Confucius would say that no other student could take Yan Hui's place, so gifted and dedicated Yan Hui had been. Veneration Yan Hui, along with Confucius himself, was venerated by the first emperor of the Han dynasty. The title which he now has in the sacrificial Canon‚ÄîFusheng (\\"Continuator of the Sage\\")‚Äîwas conferred in the ninth year of the Jiajing era, A.D. 1530. Almost all the present sacrificial titles of the worthies in the Temple of Confucius were fixed at that time. Yan Hui's place is the first of the Four Assessors, on the east of Confucius. Descendants The Yan family were from Langye (). The Yans abandoned northern China in 317. The devastation of the north during the Western Jin's (265‚Äì420) collapse caused the southward journey of Yan Han, who was mentioned in the Guan wo sheng fu by Yan Zhitui. After that, they served the Southern Dynasties. In 495 CE, Emperor Xiaowen of the Northern Wei, who venerated Confucius and his teachings, bestowed official ranks upon two scions of Yan Hui's lineage. The clan had resided in the south for eight generations when Yan Zhitui (531‚Äì591) was born. His grandfather had committed suicide by hunger strike after the 502 rebellion against the Southern Qi. Yan Zhitui himself served under several dynasties during his lifetime and composed the Family Instructions to the Yan Clan (Yanshi Jiaxun È°èÊ∞èÂÆ∂Ë®ì). He also compiled the Yuanhun Zhi ÂÜ§È≠ÇÂøó. In the approximately 1,000 years from Yan Hui's to Yan Zhitui's generation, two Yans sought a military career; most of the Yans served as literati. For most of the Ming (1368‚Äì1644) and during the entire Qing (1644‚Äì1912) dynasty, Yan Hui's descendants held the hereditary title of Wujing Boshi (‰∫îÁªèÂçöÂ£´; ‰∫îÁ∂ìÂçöÂ£´; W«îjƒ´ng B√≥sh√¨), a scholarly rank from the Hanlin Academy. In Taiwan there is an office called the \\"Sacrificial Official\\" (Fengsiguan Â•âÁ•ÄÂÆò) to the Four Sages of Confucianism, which include Yan Hui. Shrines Fusheng Hall, the main sanctuary of the Temple of Yan Hui in Qufu, Shandong province Yan Hui is venerated at the Temple of Yan Hui, which is located in Qufu's walled city, a few blocks north of the Temple of Confucius. Yan Hui's tomb is now surrounded by hundreds of tombs of his descendants, forming the Yan Family Cemetery (\\"Yan Forest\\"). A stele was installed at his tomb during the Jurchen Jin dynasty, and re-erected during the Ming Dynasty. The tomb is well preserved.

He joined the United States Army in 1832, serving at posts throughout the United States, including many remote locations in the west. During his military service, Steen explored parts of the western United States including large areas of southern New Mexico and southeastern Oregon. He served as the commander of several Union Army forts during the American Civil War. Today, there are landmarks in Oklahoma, Oregon, and New Mexico named in his honor; however, many of the place names are misspelled as Stein. Early life Steen was born on 22 February 1800 in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. His parents were Frederick Steen and Katherine Rector Steen. He was the third of five children. His family moved to Missouri when he was young. Growing up on the American frontier, Steen became a well known woodsman and hunter. As a young man, Steen worked as a surveyor before joining the volunteer Mounted Rangers as a second lieutenant on 16 July 1832.Thrapp, Dan L., Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography (Vol. III, P-Z), A.H.

Junior officer duty Steen transferred to the United States Army's 1st United States Dragoons as a second lieutenant on 19 September 1833. He was one of the initial cadre of officers to stand-up this historic cavalry unit. In 1834, he was stationed at 1st Dragoon headquarters at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In 1835, he accompanied Colonel Henry Dodge on an expedition up the Platte River, following its south fork to the Rocky Mountains and then returning by way of Bent's Fort, the Arkansas River, and the Santa Fe Trail. Later that year, Steen joined Colonel Stephen W. Kearny on an expedition along the Platte and then east to the Missouri River, meeting with Potawatomi Indians at Council Bluffs before returning to Fort Leavenworth.\\"Surveyors of the Louisiana Purchase\\" , Historical Land Records, Commissioner of State Lands, State of Arkansas, Little Rock, Arkansas, 7 July 2010.Wainwright, R.

Captain Steen was wounded at the Battle of Buena VistaSteen was promoted to first lieutenant on 5 March 1836 and then captain on 31 December 1840. While the record is not clear, it appears Steen was stationed at Fort Gibson in the Indian Territory during this period. It is known that he dispatched a detachment of dragoons from that location to escort a wagon train to Santa Fe in 1843. Steen began the Mexican War as a captain. He departed San Antonio, Texas on 29 September 1846, leading two companies of dragoons assigned to escort General John E. Wool and his staff to the front in Mexico.The Mexican War and Its Heroes, Grigg, Elliot and Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1849. During the Battle of Buena Vista on 23 February 1847, Steen led a detachment of cavalry in a charge against a large body of Mexican lancers who were attempting to capture a United States Army supply train. Steen's attack broke and dispersed the Mexican lancer formation, saving the Army's supplies.Longacre, Edward G., A Soldier to the Last: Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler in Blue and Gray, Potomac Books, Dulles, Virginia, 2007, p. 12. Steen was severely wounded during the battle, earning a brevet promotion to major for personal gallantry and meritorious conduct. Steen's brevet promotion was effective as of 23 February 1847, the day of the battle. New Mexico In the summer of 1849, Steen escorted a civilian party from Fort Leavenworth to Santa Fe in New Mexico Territory. After completing his escort duty, he established and commanded an Army outpost at Do√±a Ana in southern New Mexico. From there, Steen with a detachment of 50 cavalrymen tracked a band of Mimbres Apache raiders to the Santa Rita copper mines. Steen and his men engaged and defeated the Indians on 16 August 1849. However, Steen was badly wounded during the battle. This was the first military engagement between the United States Army and Apache warriors. In June 1850, Steen led an expedition through the Organ Mountains, around the southern edge of the White Sands desert area and into Mescalero Apache country when he ran into a superior Indian force, and he withdrew to Do√±a Ana. Based on his reconnaissance, Steen recommended that an Army post be established near the Santa Rita mines. The Army agreed with Steen's recommendation, and Fort Webster was established in 1852. Steen was assigned as the fort's first commander. However, before taking command, Steen was sent back east to lead 183 Army recruits to New Mexico for duty. Steen finally took command of Fort Webster on 7 April 1853. Shortly after taking command, he successfully negotiated peace treaties with Mangas Colorado, head chief of the Mimbreno Apaches and Victorio, war chief of the Mimbreno Apaches. In May 1853, Steen escorted William Carr Lane from Fort Webster to the Gila River. It was probably during this trip that Steins Peak and Stein's Pass in southwestern New Mexico acquired their place names. Both were important reference points for frontier travelers. Steen was promoted to the permanent grade of major on 15 July 1853. While he was on leave the post of Fort Webster was abandoned, and Fort Thorn opened on the Rio Grande. Upon his return in May 1854 Steen took command of that post until December. In 1856, Steen negotiated an agreement with Cochise, chief of the Chiricahua Apaches, allowing settlers to cross Apache land while traveling to California. In 1857, Steen helped establish Camp Moore near present-day Rio Rico, Arizona. In 1858, Steen established Fort Buchanan in the newly acquired Gadsden Purchase (near present-day Sonoita, Arizona), and became the post's first commander. He hoped the outpost would deter Chiricahua Apache raids in the Sonoita Valley area.Pfanz, Donald C., Richard S. Ewell, A Soldier's Life, University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 1998, pp. 92, 100.\\"Dragoons: Garrisoning the Gadsden Purchase\\", Huachuca Illustrated (Volume 11), Huachuca Museum Society, Fort Huachuca, Arizona, 1999, p. 21. Later that year, he escorted a survey party led by Lieutenant Edward Beale along a proposed road route from Fort Smith, Arkansas to the Colorado River. During the trip, Steen's Buttes in Caddo County, Oklahoma was named in his honor. Steen then led six companies of cavalry into Utah as the Mormon War was coming to a close. Oregon Steens Mountain is the tallest peak in southeast OregonBy 1860, Steen was posted in Oregon. On 28 March of that year, General William S. Harney ordered him to lead an expedition from Fort Dalles to Harney Lake, a distance of . Steen's party followed the Walla Walla road to the mouth of the Deschutes River. He then turned south passing through the Ochoco highlands and the Trout Creek area before exploring the upper Deschutes River country. Near Pilot Butte, Steen turned east toward Harney Lake conducting road survey work along the way. While en route, another Army survey party led by Captain Andrew J. Smith was attacked by Indians north of Harney Lake. Steen immediately abandoned his survey work and proceeded to the Harney Lake where he joined Smith and his party. To protect the survey teams in the area, Steen established Camp Union on Silver Creek, north of Harney Lake.Brogan, Phil F., East of the Cascades (Third Edition), Binford and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1965, pp. 61‚Äì64.\\"Special Order No. 37, Headquarters Department of Oregon, Fort Vancouver, 28 March 1860\\", Message of the President of the United States to the Two Houses of Congress at the Commencement of the Second Session of the Thirty-Seventh Congress (Volume II), Report of the Secretary of War, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 3 December 1861, p. 528. On a reconnaissance expedition from Camp Union, Steen explored the country along the Donner und Blitzen River, south of Harney Lake. After a skirmish with Paiute Indians in that area, he chased the Indians over a rugged peak that Hudson's Bay Company trapper, John Work, called Snow Mountain. After Steen and his men crossed the mountain in pursuit of the Indians, the peak became known as Steens Mountain.McArthur, Lewis A., McArthur, Lewis L., Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, pp. 912‚Äì913.\\"A Little Bit of Malheur History\\" , Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of Interior, Princeton, Oregon, 10 November 2008. In late 1860, Steen was given command of Fort Walla Walla in the Washington Territory. He remained there until the outbreak of the American Civil War. Civil War In April 1861, Confederate force attacked Fort Sumter, initiating the Civil War. On 3 August 1861, Steen was assigned to the 1st Cavalry Regiment and ordered to return to the east coast. On 28 September, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel, reassigned to the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, and posted to Cantonment Holt near Washington, D.C.. Steen remained there until June 1862, when he was sent to Fort Craig in the New Mexico Territory. While Steen remained loyal to the Union, his son, Alexander Early Steen, served as a brigadier general in the Confederate Army. He was killed on 7 December 1862 at the Battle of Prairie Grove in Arkansas.\\"Monuments and Memorials\\", Historical Information, Fort Smith National Cemetery, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Fort Smith, Arkansas, 6 January 2011. In March 1863, Steen was reassigned to Benton Barracks in Missouri. On 23 September 1863, he was officially retired from the Army at Benton Barracks, for incapacity resulting from long and faithful service and wounds received in the line of duty. However, Steen continued to serve on active duty in various capacities. On 30 September 1863, he was placed in command of the Union Army's fort at Sandy Hook, New Jersey, overlooking New York Harbor. In 1866, Steen was sent to the Colorado Territory to command Fort Lyon.Henry, Guy V., \\"Enoch Steen\\", Military Record of Army and Civilian Appointments in the United States Army (Volume II), D. Van Nostrand Publisher, New York, New York, 1873, p. 193. Later life When Congress passed a law prohibiting retired officers from serving on active duty, Steen left the Army. He settled on a farm in Jackson County, Missouri. Steen died at his Jackson County home on 22 January 1880. He is buried at Mount St. Mary's Cemetery in Kansas City, Missouri. Legacy Steen played an important part in the history of the western United States, leading military expeditions through large areas of the west. As a result of his early explorations, there are landmarks in Oklahoma, Oregon, and New Mexico named in his honor. In Oklahoma's Caddo County, a group of three of sandstone hills were named Steen's Buttes by Lieutenant Edward Beale whose survey team was escorted by cavalry under Major Steen's command.Wright, Muriel H., \\"Steen's Buttes\\", Mark of Heritage, Oklahoma Historical Society, University of Oklahoma Press, Norman Oklahoma, 1976.Peterson, Robert V., \\"Some Interesting Historical Items About West Central Oklahoma\\", Durant Daily Democrat, Durant, Oklahoma, 5 June 1983, p. 13. Steins Pillar in central Oregon was named for Major SteenThe most prominent landmark that bears Steen's name is Steens Mountain in Harney County, Oregon. With a summit, Steens Mountain is the highest peak in southeastern Oregon. The mountain extends over north to south. As a result, it is often mistaken for mountain range rather than a single peak.\\"List of Oregon's Highest Peaks\\", Mazama Mountaineering Center, Portland, Oregon, 4 March 2011. Another Oregon landmark named in honor of Steen is Steins Pillar. It is a high rock column in the Ochoco Mountains of central Oregon. Because of an overhanging ledge near its summit, the pillar was not successfully climbed until 1950.Staats, Scott, \\"Steins Pillar Offers Hikers A Look Into The Ochoco's Ancient Past\\", Bend Weekly, 18 August 2006.\\"Steins Pillar\\", Summit Post, www.summitpost.org, 7 July 2010. There is also ghost town in New Mexico named Steins. The town site is located just off Interstate 10 in Hidalgo County. It was originally called Stein's Pass after the nearby pass through the Peloncillo Mountains, where Steen camped in 1856 while exploring the Gadsden Purchase. The town was founded in 1880 as a fueling stop for the Southern Pacific Railroad. In the early 1900s, the town had 1,300 residents; however, the population slowly declined until the town disappeared.Julyan, Robert Hixson, \\"Steins\\", The Place Names of New Mexico (2nd edition), University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 1998, pp. 341‚Äì342, .Claridge, Drusilla, \\"Steins‚Äîa Railroad Ghost Town\\" , www.southernnewmexico.com, 16 July 2003. In southwest New Mexico, there are two mountains and a stream named in Steen's honor. Steins Mountain is located northwest of the Steins town site. The summit of Steins Mountain is above sea level. Stein Peak is located to the northwest of Stein's Mountain. Its summit elevation is . Both mountains are part of the Peloncillo Range.

Aubrey Smith) is regaling his dinner guests of his exploits as a police officer decades earlier in Africa. He keys in a case where he had to track down a gang of three men who were suspected of a series of murders. He does stumble on them, but they actually end up capturing him. Fortunately, he was able to talk his way out of that predicament, and later on tracked them down again and captured them. One was hanged for his crimes, while the other two were sentenced to twenty years in prison. Little does Hilton know that two of his dinner guests, Edward Laverick (Warwick Ward) and Edward Carter (Robert Loraine), are the two men who he sent to prison. They have vowed revenge, and prior to dinner, they exact it, killing Hilton. However, they have planned it to look like a suicide on the part of the elderly aristocrat. Initially, their plot seems successful, as the local constables who arrive to investigate the incident buy into the suicide scenario. Hilton's nephew, Jimmy Hilton (Frank Lawton), and his girlfriend Mollie (Dorothy Boyd), who also happens to be the ward of the elder Hilton, become suspicious of the story told by the two men, and begin their own investigation. Their questioning leads them to arrive at the truth, and the two murderers are apprehended.

He felt the direction was uneven, stating the overall production, \\"may not be endowed with imaginative direction, but, because of the author's intriguing story and C. Aubrey Smith's excellent performance, it succeeds in being an entertaining study of a cool, calculating murderer\\". Notes Rupert Downing also contributed to the screenplay. The film's art direction was by Clifford Pember. Jack Hawkins made his screen debut in this film. The play on which this film is based was produced in London at the Haymarket Theatre in 1928.

Gameplay One-Eye (right), fighting a pirate captain using a cutlass The game's player characters are One-Eye (player one) and Red Dog (player two), pirates on a venture to find a wizard who kidnapped their princess. In order to rescue their princess, they must collect weapons and booty. The booty is traded for weapons at the end of each level. Which weapons the player receives and how much of each weapon is dependent on what types and how much of each type of booty the player collected. Collecting weapons and booty is absolutely necessary in this game, as your default punch attack is not very powerful and ultimately ineffective. There are several different types of weapons and booty to collect in each level, though not all weapon types appear in every level. The three major weapon types, which appear in most levels are; a cutlass, this is the weakest of the three and only has a slightly farther range than the punch. However, you will not waste a cutlass if it does not hit an enemy. A knife, the mid-level weapon, similar to the knife weapon in Castlevania. The player throws this weapon in a straight line in front of them. Lastly is a flintlock pistol, the most powerful of the three. This weapon fires a musket ball straight in front of the player. To complete each level, the player must defeat 15 enemies, and a level boss. Skull & Crossbones has seven game levels. In some ports of the game, the first six levels may be played in any sequence: One-Eye's Ship, Spanish Castle, Pirate's Ship #1, Ninja Camp, Pirate's Ship #2, Beach Cave, and Pirate's Ship #3. Once these levels are complete, the players go to the final level, the Wizard's Lair. In the arcade version the players are also given three opportunities to change the difficulty of the game, at the end of One-Eye's Ship level and after the first two Pirate's Ship levels, and have a chance to get an opportunity item in the Castle, Ninja Lair, and Beach Cave. However the levels are forcibly played in the written sequence above. In two player, there are a few specific changes to how the game plays. Players must duel at the end of the level to see which gets the invulnerability item in the levels that have them (The non Pirate Ship levels) Each Quarter adds 50 health points to whichever player the coin was added for. Each level has a timelimit that can be raised by finding hourglasses off killed enemies, but running out of time only results in slowly losing life and can be counteracted by putting in additional quarters. Each of the two player pirates behave the same and face either left or right but can turn with the appropriate button. The sword button can be pressed to block and the move stick can be used in addition to throw various attacks, thrusts and stabs. Red X's appeared often denoting jumps and cranks, and white crosses can be dug up with the sword button to find various treasures. A parrot belonging to the pirate constantly flies with the players and recites roughly twelve different lines nonstop. The parrots only appear in the arcade version. Each of the three pirate ship levels has a Pirate Captain boss at the end of the level and a woman referred to the game as a wench who seems to provide no game benefits, while the other three levels have an Executioner(Heavy Hitter), Monk(Fast Attacker), and Medusa(Turret) boss for their respective stages. The Medusa's attacks can be avoided altogether by facing away and using back-stabs (if the players have chosen the easiest difficulty thus far, an onscreen hint advises them not to look at Medusa.) In the Wizards Lair, these bosses are encountered again in order and the player who grabbed the invulnerability item on their respective stages immediately regains the use of that item for a duration. The wizard boss at the end will appear on one side of the room and launch Wizard Balls that stun the player and when attacked will teleport to the other side and continue. After several hits the player will behead him and will be given a chance to pick up some last wealth items before the game is proclaimed to be over soon afterwards. Reception The One gave the Amiga version of Skull & Crossbones an overall score of 77%, noting it as \\"a slight deviation from the usual beat 'em up fare, and it gives the genre a couple of unusual twists.\\" The One praises Skull & Crossbones' graphics and music, stating that the graphics \\"convey the action well enough and, together with a brace of catchy tunes, they help create the perfect pirate atmosphere\\" and express that the two- player mode adds \\"a lot more fun, since you've got the added element of fighting over who gets the extra energy and money.\\" The One concludes that \\"[Skull & Crossbones] isn't the greatest or most polished beat 'em up in existence\\" but is 'good and entertaining'.

ISRR is a free mutual consent adoption reunion registry for persons desiring a reunion with next-of-kin. This agency serves the needs of family members who have been separated from each other by adoption, divorce, foster care, abandonment, or other means. The registry's filing system was based originally on Soundex Code which is a phonetic way of coding giving numeric value to consonants and ignores vowels, except as a first letter. This system allows for matching despite some differences in spelling. It was a perfect foundation for a situation where often people did not know exact spelling. The founder, Emma May Vilardi, was a remarkable woman of extraordinary vision and courage who undertook this important, humane task of providing a safe and secure way for persons seeking contact to make themselves available to each other. This registry remains her legacy to the adoption community and the hundreds of thousands served. \\"It was not until Emma began looking for the reasons behind the many illnesses that she had suffered that she learned that ancestors and genetics were the key to understanding her health problems. Daring a probate judge to unseal an adoption record, she quickly learned that her ancestors had succumbed to the same diseases.\\" The ISRR Executive Board of Trustees is responsible for ensuring the operation of the registry for future generations. The registry motto is, \\"United today for the reunions of tomorrow.\\" For many it remains a place of hope when they feel all other resources have been exhausted, for others it was a quick and easy step that led them to connect with family members they longed to know. Now one of many existing adoption reunion registries, Soundex is the oldest and largest of its kind. It served as a model for many state registries, for Senator Carl Levin's U.S. Senate Bill's in the 1980s trying to establish a national adoption registry, and into the 1990s and for the abundance of online registries established to help adoptees and birth family member find each other. The adoption reform movement groups supported ISRR and recommended their members register. Most state registries, agencies and courts also refer directly to ISRR as an option for those seeking reunification with family. There are many articles and references archived in newsletters, clippings and other resources. Registration at ISRR is free because of the donations made by registrants, and the time given by volunteers. Dear Abby referred to ISRR many times over the years. Each time registrations would arrive by the thousands resulting in many matches. One story is of an adoptee who registered 20 years to the day of when his birthmother's registration arrived. Both had read the same Dear Abby article. The adoptee had carried it in his wallet for twenty years. There are around 225,000 active registrations, at any given time. ISRR was paper based until 2003, when the volunteers began an imaging project that took five years to complete. Now all forms are digitized.

The ship was constructed in the French Societ√© Nouvelles des Forges et Chantiers shipyard in Toulon; her hull was laid in 1866 and launched in January 1867. The ship was commissioned into the Prussian Navy in October 1867. The ship was the third ironclad ordered by the Prussian Navy, after and , though the fourth ship to be acquired, , was ordered after but commissioned before Friedrich Carl. Friedrich Carl served with the fleet from her commissioning in 1867 until 1895, when she was removed from front-line service to serve as a training ship. During the Franco-Prussian War in 1870‚Äì1871, the ship formed part of the main German squadron commanded by Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Eduard von Jachmann. Engine trouble, however, plagued the ship and two of the other three vessels in the squadron; as a result, they made only two sorties from the port of Wilhelmshaven to challenge the French blockade. Neither resulted in combat. Friedrich Carl was also deployed to Spain during an insurrection in 1873, during which she assisted in the seizure of three rebel vessels in two engagements. The ship was refitted at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven in the 1880s. She was renamed Neptun in 1902 and used as a harbor ship until June 1905, when she was removed from the naval register. The following year, she was sold to ship breakers in the Netherlands and dismantled for scrap.  Design  Following the acquisition of the small ironclad warships and , which were only usable in coastal areas, the Prussian Navy sought to acquire armored vessels capable of operations on the high seas. The purpose of the new ships would be primarily directed against Prussia's primary naval rival, Denmark, which in the recent Second Schleswig War had imposed a blockade of German ports that Prussia had not been able to break. Ironclads were at that time a recent development and the only option for sea- going warships was the armored frigate, modeled on traditional sailing ships with a battery on the broadside. The navy requested approval from the Landtag in 1865 for an expanded budget to acquire the needed vessels, but the parliament refused, prompting King Wilhelm I to circumvent the legislature with a decree on 4 July authorizing the purchase of two armored frigates. At that time, Britain and France had the shipbuilders most experienced with the type, so the navy decided to order one vessel from each country. The contract for Friedrich Carl was placed on 9 January 1866 followed by that for four days later, from France and Britain respectively. The French-built Friedrich Carl was modeled on , albeit a smaller version of the French ironclad. = General characteristics = Friedrich Carl was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. The ship was designed to displace at a normal loading, and up to with a full load. The ship's hull was constructed with transverse and longitudinal iron frames. It contained eight watertight compartments and had a double bottom that ran for 76 percent of the length of the vessel. Friedrich Carl was an excellent sea boat; the ship was responsive to commands from the helm and had a moderate turning radius. She was somewhat unbalanced, however, and a 6 degree rudder to port was required to keep the ship on a straight course. The ship's crew numbered 33 officers and 498 enlisted men, and while serving as a flagship, the crew was augmented with a command staff of 6 officers and 35 enlisted men. Friedrich Carl carried a number of smaller boats, including a large tender, two launches, a pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and one dinghy. A horizontal two-cylinder single expansion steam engine powered the ship. It drove a four-bladed screw in diameter. Six trunk boilers, divided into two boiler rooms with eleven fireboxes in each, supplied steam to the engine at . The propulsion system was rated at and a top speed of , though on trials Friedrich Carl managed to make and . The ship carried of coal, which enabled a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . A barque rig with a surface area of 2,010 square meters supplemented the steam engine, though in service they added little to the ship's performance. Steering was controlled with a single rudder. = Armament and armor = As built, Friedrich Carl was equipped with twenty-six rifled 72-pounder cannon. After her delivery to Germany, these guns were replaced with a pair of L/22 guns and fourteen 21 cm L/19 guns. The L/22 gun could depress to ‚àí5 degrees and elevate to 13 degrees, which provided a range of . The shorter barreled L/19 guns had a wider range of elevation, from ‚àí8 to 14.5 degrees, but the shorter barrel imposed a lower muzzle velocity, which correspondingly reduced the range of the gun to . The two types of gun fired the same shell, of which the total supply numbered 1,656 rounds of ammunition. The fourteen L/19 guns were placed in a central battery amidships, seven on either broadside. The L/22 guns were placed on either end of the ship. Later in her career, six Hotchkiss revolver cannon and five torpedo tubes were added. Two of the tubes were placed in the bow, two on the ship's sides, and one in the stern on the port side. All were placed above water, and were supplied with twelve torpedoes. Friedrich Carls armor consisted of wrought iron backed with heavy teak planking. The waterline armored belt consisted of of iron backed with of teak. The central battery was protected by 114 mm of sloped iron plating on of timber. The battery's roof was protected by iron plating. The ship's conning tower had iron armor mounted on of teak.  Service history  The Prussian Navy ordered Friedrich Carl from a French shipbuilder in 1865. She was laid down at the Societ√© Nouvelles des Forges et Chantiers La Seyne shipyard in Toulon the following year. The ship was launched on 16 January 1867; fitting out work was completed rapidly, and the ship was completed before the end of the year. Friedrich Carl was delivered to Prussia in October 1867 and commissioned into the fleet on the 3rd of the month. Crews for Friedrich Carl and Kronprinz were carried to the ships by the screw frigate and the screw corvette . Both ironclads were laid up without any armament on entering service, as the new guns that had been intended to have been installed suffered serious failures during testing in 1867‚Äì1868; the Kreiner breech blocks proved to be prone to failure and so Krupp-designed guns were installed instead, with the work completed by July 1869. = Franco- Prussian War = At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, the greatly numerically inferior Prussian Navy assumed a defensive posture against a naval blockade imposed by the French Navy. Friedrich Carl and the broadside ironclads Kronprinz and , along with the small ironclad ram Prinz Adalbert, had been steaming in the English Channel before the French declared war; they had left Plymouth on 10 July with the intention of steaming to Fayal in the Azores. On the 13th, however, they put into port and learned of the rising tension between France and Prussia. The ships therefore returned to Wilhelmshaven immediately, arriving on 16 July. France declared war on Prussia three days later on 19 July. Friedrich Carl, Kronprinz, and K√∂nig Wilhelm were concentrated in the North Sea at the port of Wilhelmshaven. They were subsequently joined there by the turret ship Arminius, which had been stationed in Kiel. Despite the great French naval superiority, the French had conducted insufficient pre-war planning for an assault on the Prussian naval installations, and concluded that it would only be possible with Danish assistance, which was not forthcoming. The four ships, under the command of Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Eduard von Jachmann, made an offensive sortie in early August 1870 out to the Dogger Bank, though they encountered no French warships. Friedrich Carl and the other two broadside ironclads thereafter suffered from chronic engine trouble, which left Arminius alone to conduct operations. Friedrich Carl, Kronprinz, and K√∂nig Wilhelm stood off the island of Wangerooge for the majority of the conflict, while Arminius was stationed in the mouth of the Elbe river. On 11 September, the three broadside ironclads were again ready for action; they joined Arminius for another major operation into the North Sea. It too did not encounter French opposition, as the French Navy had by this time returned to France. Through the 1870s, the German armored fleet typically saw active service during the summer months. Over the winter, most of the vessels were placed in reserve with one or two kept in a state of reduced commission as guard ships. In June 1871, the screw corvette was in Brazil while on an overseas cruise; some of her crew had been arrested following a fistfight in the country. The Germans threatened to deploy Kronprinz, three more corvettes, and two gunboats, which convinced the Brazilian government to release the crewmen. Beginning in September 1872, Friedrich Carl embarked on a world cruise with the screw frigate and the gunboat . They were joined by Elisabeths sister ships and while cruising through the Caribbean Sea. = Deployment to Spain = Illustration of the action between Friedrich Carl and the rebel steamer Vigilante In early 1873, the First Spanish Republic was beset with the Cantonal Revolution. Friedrich Carl, under the command of Vizeadmiral Reinhold Werner, steamed to Spanish waters along with a pair of unarmored vessels. The ships joined a British squadron that had been patrolling the southern Spanish coast. A rebel faction of the Spanish Navy had seized four of the country's seven ironclads. Werner, the senior commander in the group, was given command of the Anglo-German force. The squadron blockaded two rebel ironclads in the port of Cartagena after they had bombarded a coastal town. While steaming off Alicante, Friedrich Carl encountered the rebel armed steamer Vigilante, seized the vessel, and returned it to the national government. Friedrich Carl and the British ironclad attacked two of the rebel ships‚ÄîVitoria and Almansa‚Äîwithout authorization from London or Berlin. The rebel vessels had attempted to extort the port of Almer√≠a. In the brief engagement, the Anglo-German force overwhelmed the rebels and seized both ships, which were subsequently turned over to the Spanish government. The rebels considered declaring war on Germany over the affair, but eventually decided against it. A captured rebel leader was briefly held on board Friedrich Carl. Werner's blockade eventually forced the rebels to surrender, after which Friedrich Carl returned to Germany. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck ordered a court-martial for Werner, whose actions Bismarck considered to be excessive. Bismarck prohibited the Imperial Navy from conducting \\"gunboat diplomacy\\" in the future. = Later service = Illustration of the fleet conducting maneuvers, including Friedrich Carl and several other ironclads and other vessels In 1876, the ironclad squadron‚ÄîKronprinz, Friedrich Carl, and the new ironclads and ‚Äîwere sent to the Mediterranean Sea in response to the murder of the German consul in Salonika in the Ottoman Empire. The German ships were joined by French, Russian, Italian, and Austro-Hungarian warships in an international demonstration condemning the murder. The Germans returned home in August and, after arriving in September, were laid up for the winter. The squadron went to the Mediterranean again in 1877, though this time it included Friedrich Carl, Kaiser, Deutschland, and the turret ship , along with the aviso . During the cruise, the ships visited various ports in the Aegean Sea and along the Levant. Friedrich Carl remained laid up for the 1878 training cruise that saw the loss of the brand-new ironclad in an accidental collision with Kaiser. She returned to service in May 1879, serving as the flagship of the training squadron, which also included Kronprinz, Preussen, and . The ship remained in service through 1883; later that year, the training cycle concluded with a large-scale simulated attack on Kiel, with Friedrich Carl and the other ironclads acting as an \\"eastern\\" opponent. The defenders, led by the corvettes and , were judged to have been victorious. The armored fleet operated entirely under steam power that year, the first time it did so. In 1885, Friedrich Carl had torpedo nets installed; these remained on the ship until 1897. During the 1885 refit, she also received new boilers and a modified funnel that had a second uptake installed. The battery of six 37 mm Hotchkiss guns and five torpedo tubes were also fitted during this modernization. The ship took part in the 1885 maneuvers with the armored corvettes and . In 1887, she was present for the ceremonies marking the beginning of construction of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, which was to link the Kiel with the North Sea. In 1895, the ship was disarmed; she was placed into service as a torpedo test ship on 11 August of that year. She served in this capacity until 21 January 1902, when she was renamed Neptun and used as a harbor ship. Her name was then freed to be reused on the new armored cruiser , which was launched on 22 June 1902. Neptun was formally stricken from the naval register on 22 June 1905 and sold to a Dutch ship-breaking firm in March 1906 for 284,000 gold marks. The ship was then towed to the Netherlands and broken up for scrap.

Draft-card burning was a symbol of protest performed by thousands of young men in the United States and Australia in the 1960s and early 1970s. The first draft-card burners were American men taking part in the opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War. The first well- publicized protest was in December 1963, with a 22-year old conscientious objector, Eugene Keyes, setting fire to his card on Christmas Day in Champaign, Illinois.\\"U. of I. Professor's Son Defies Draft, Burns Card\\", Chicago Tribune, December 27, 1963, p1A-6 In May 1964, a larger demonstration, with about 50 people in Union Square, New York, was organized by the War Resisters League chaired by David McReynolds.\\"War Protesters\\", in Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices Roger Chapman, ed. (M.E. Sharpe, 2010) p596 By May 1965 it was happening with greater frequency around the US. To limit this kind of protest, in August 1965, the United States Congress enacted a law to broaden draft card violations to punish anyone who \\"knowingly destroys, knowingly mutilates\\" his draft card. Subsequently, 46 men were indictedGershon, 1991, p. 173. \\"Of the more than twenty-five thousand men who destroyed their draft cards, most of them publicly, only forty-six were indicted...\\" for burning their draft cards at various rallies, and four major court cases were heard. One of them, United States v. O'Brien, was argued before the Supreme Court. The act of draft card burning was defended as a symbolic form of free speech, a constitutional right guaranteed by the First Amendment. The Supreme Court decided against the draft card burners; it determined that the federal law was justified and that it was unrelated to the freedom of speech. In Australia following the 1966 troop increases directed by Prime Minister Harold Holt, conscription notices were burned at mass demonstrations against Australian involvement in Vietnam. In June 1968, the government reacted by strengthening penalties for infractions of the Menzies Government 1964 National Service Act, including the burning of registration cards. War protest ceased in 1972 when Australia's new Labor government withdrew troops from Vietnam and abolished conscription. From 1965 to 1973, very few men in the US were convicted of burning their draft cards. Some 25,000 others went unpunished. Before 1965, the act of burning a draft card was already prohibited by US statute‚Äîthe registrant was required to carry the card at all times, and any destruction of it was thus against the law. Also, it was entirely possible for a young man to destroy his draft card and still answer his country's call to service by appearing at an induction center and serving in the military, and it was possible for a registrant to faithfully keep his card on his person but fail to appear when called. The draft card was not an essential part of the government's ability to draft men into the military. Thus draft-card burning was an act of war resistance more than it was draft resistance. The image of draft card burning was a powerful one, influential in American politics and culture. It appeared in magazines, newspapers and on television, signaling a political divide between those who backed the US government and its military goals and those who were against any US involvement in Vietnam. Richard Nixon ran for president in 1968 on a platform based partly on putting an end to the draft, in order to undercut protesters making use of the symbolic act. As president, Nixon ended the draft in 1973, rendering unnecessary the symbolic act of draft-card burning. Background =United States= A Vietnam-era draft card worn out from years in a wallet From 1948, under the Selective Service Act, all American men aged 18 through 25 were required to register with a local draft board. In case of war, the able-bodied ones among them could be drafted to serve in the military. The law required the men to carry their draft cards with them at all times. These were small cards bearing the registrant's identifying information, the date and place of registration, and a unique Selective Service number. In an amendment sponsored by Congressmen L. Mendel Rivers and William G. Bray, on August 31, 1965, the law was augmented with four words, to include penalties for any person who \\"knowingly destroys, knowingly mutilates\\" the card, under 50 U.S.C. ¬ß 462(b)(3). Strom Thurmond moved the bill through the Senate, calling draft-card burning \\"contumacious conduct\\" which \\"represents a potential threat to the exercise of the power to raise and support armies.\\" At the time, many observers (including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit) believed that Congress had intentionally targeted anti-war draft-card burners.On the intent behind the amendment, the Court of Appeals wrote, \\"We would be closing our eyes in the light of the prior law if we did not see on the face of the amendment that it was precisely directed at public as distinguished from private destruction. In other words, a special offense was committed by persons such as the defendant who made a spectacle of their disobedience.\\" O'Brien v. United States, 376 F.2d 538, 541 (1st Cir. 1967). =Australia= Following the 1964 National Service Act, legislated in response to the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation, 20-year-old Australian men were subject to military service based on a birthday lottery. In April 1965, Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies sent a battalion of Army regulars to Vietnam, beginning an overseas involvement in that country which lasted for seven years and provoked deeply divisive debate back home. In early 1966, Menzies retired and Harold Holt became Prime Minister. In March 1966, Holt announced troop increases bringing the total commitment to 4,500 men in Vietnam, a tripling of effort. Significantly, conscripts could now be sent into combat. Protests broke out, including a draft-card burning demonstration outside of Holt's home. In late June 1966 with President Lyndon B. Johnson listening, Holt spoke in Washington, D.C. in support of American policy. In his speech he closed by saying that Australia was a \\"staunch friend\\" of America, willing to go \\"all the way with LBJ\\". This statement was widely criticized in Australia. Marxist writer and draft-card burner Andy Blunden said in July that, \\"by following America into Vietnam, Holt's Australia is playing the role of Mussolini's Italy.\\" In December the government bolstered the Vietnam presence with 1,700 more troops. John Gorton took the Prime Minister position in January 1968. In June 1968, the government doubled the penalty for the burning of registration cards. In 1971, the government committed to a gradual but total withdrawal from Vietnam‚Äîfollowing both Australian opinion and America's new policy. In 1972, all troops including the advisory team were ordered home from Vietnam. Draft resisters in jail were freed. The final birthday lottery was held September 22, 1972. US court cases =Early cases= Antiwar protesters in January 1965 On October 15, 1965, David J. Miller burned his draft card at a rally held near the Armed Forces Induction Center on Whitehall Street in Manhattan. He spoke briefly to the crowd from atop a sound truck and then tried but failed to burn his card with matches‚Äîthe wind kept blowing them out. A lighter was offered by the crowd and it worked. Miller was arrested by the FBI three days later in Manchester, New Hampshire while setting up peace literature on a table. The 24-year-old pacifist, member of the Catholic Worker Movement, became the first man convicted under the 1965 amendment. In April 1966 with his wife and breast-feeding baby in attendance, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison. The case was argued in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in June. Miller's attorney held that \\"symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible.\\" The court did not agree. The case was decided later that year in October: Miller's conviction was confirmed and his sentence upheld. Loudon Wainwright, Jr. wrote in Life magazine that Miller, \\"without really knowing it, might be embarking on a lifelong career of protest.\\" Miller remained free on bail until June 1968 at which time he served 22 months in federal prison. At an anti-war rally at the Iowa Memorial Union in Iowa City, Iowa, on October 20, 1965, 20-year-old Stephen Lynn Smith, a student at the University of Iowa, spoke to the crowd and burned his draft card. He said, \\"I do not feel that five years of my life are too much to give to say that this law is wrong.\\" He had previously alerted newspaper reporters and two television stations, and they were present to record his act. Smith said he was against the involvement of the US in Vietnam, and that he was against the system of conscription. In November 1966 he was found guilty and placed on probation for three years. In June‚ÄìJuly 1967, United States v. Edelman was argued and decided in the US Second Circuit. Tom Cornell, Marc Paul Edelman and Roy Lisker had burned their draft cards at a public rally organized by the Committee for Non-Violent Action in Union Square, New York City, on November 6, 1965. A fourth man older than 36 also burned his card at the rally but was not indicted. Edelman, Cornell and Lisker were convicted and sentenced to six months. =United States v. O'Brien= On the morning of March 31, 1966, David Paul O'Brien and three companions burned their draft cards on the steps of the South Boston Courthouse, in front of a crowd that included several FBI agents. After the four men came under attack from some of the crowd, an FBI agent ushered O'Brien inside the courthouse and advised him of his rights. O'Brien made a confession and produced the charred remains of the certificate. He was then indicted for violating ¬ß 462(b)(3) and put on trial in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.The facts of O'Brien's protest, arrest, and trial are summarized in the Supreme Court's opinion, United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 369‚Äì70 (1968). O'Brien argued that the four words (\\"knowingly destroys, knowingly mutilates\\") added to the draft card law were unconstitutional, that they were an abridgment of the freedom of speech. He argued that the amendment served no valid purpose because the Selective Service Act already required draft registrants to carry their card on their persons at all times, thus any form of destruction was already a violation. He explained that he burned the draft card publicly as a form of symbolic speech to persuade others to oppose the war, \\"so that other people would reevaluate their positions with Selective Service, with the armed forces, and reevaluate their place in the culture of today, to hopefully consider my position.\\" On January 24, 1968, the Supreme Court determined that the 1965 amendment was constitutional as enacted and as applied, and that it did not distinguish between public or private destruction or mutilation of the draft card. They determined that there was nothing necessarily expressive in the burning of a draft card. Chief Justice Earl Warren said, \\"we cannot accept the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled 'speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea.\\" O'Brien's previous sentence of six years was upheld. The Supreme Court's conclusion was criticized by legal observers such as Dean Alfange Jr for its \\"astonishingly cavalier\\" treatment. Many saw in O'Brien's act a clear communicative element with the \\"intent to convey a particularized message\\", an intent to which the court did not give much weight. Instead, the court weighed as greater the government's interest \\"in assuring the continued availability of issued Selective Service certificates.\\" In 1975, legal scholar John Hart Ely found fault with O'Brien. He pointed out that the draft-card- burning question was not decided in relation to the similar one surrounding the act of flag burning; an issue which the court had avoided for years. Ely's analysis was aided by that of Thomas Scanlon in 1972, in A Theory of Freedom of Expression, which interpreted the freedom of speech broadly, including such public and political acts as self-immolation. In 1990 O'Brien was analyzed again by critics following the case United States v. Eichman which determined that flag burning was a form of free speech, and some made comparisons to the earlier 1984 case Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence which determined that sleeping at a protest rally location in a downtown park was valid as a symbolic expression intended to bring attention to the plight of the homeless. These expansive interpretations of the freedom of speech appeared large enough to include draft-card burning. The position taken in O'Brien was that the individual's right to freedom of speech did not limit the government in prohibiting harmful conduct. However, the harmful conduct of burning a draft card did not have the normal test applied: it was not determined to be a case of \\"clear and present danger\\". In 1996, future Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan pointed out that the O'Brien court did not appear to be concerned whether the law as enacted or enforced \\"matched, or even resembled\\" the asserted government interest of stopping draft resistance protests. Kagan noted that the law prohibiting the destruction of the draft card \\"interfered\\" with only one point of view: that of the anti-war protester. She allowed as how a successful challenge to O'Brien might come from focusing on such skewed constraints. Rallies On Armed Forces Day in the United States (Saturday, May 16, 1964), in New York, 12 students at a rally burned their draft cards. Melvin Small, Antiwarriors: The Vietnam War and the Battle for America's Hearts and Minds(Rowman & Littlefield, 2002) p13 (Quote: \\"On May 16, 1964, on Armed Forces Day, twelve men took one step beyond advertisements by burning their draft cards in public in New York City.\\") At the University of California, Berkeley, on May 5, 1965, amid a protest march of several hundred people carrying a black coffin to the Berkeley draft board, 40 men burned their draft cards. One of them told reporters the act was symbolic‚Äîhe said \\"we can get new cards if we apply for them.\\" On May 22, 1965, the Berkeley draft board was visited again, with 19 men burning their cards. President Lyndon B. Johnson was hanged in effigy. In August 1965, Life carried a photograph of a man demonstrating in front of the Armed Forces Induction Center on Whitehall Street in Manhattan, July 30, 1965. Like David J. Miller a few months later, he was a member of the Catholic Worker Movement. He was not arrested. Antiwar activist Abbie Hoffman burned his draft card privately in the Spring of 1967. Hoffman's card classified him as 4F‚Äîunfit for service‚Äîbecause of bronchial asthma. His act was purely symbolic; he would never be drafted. However, Hoffman supported those registrants who were burning their cards. Green Beret Gary Rader offers his draft card to be burnt. On April 15, 1967, at Sheep Meadow, Central Park, New York City, some 60 young men including a few students from Cornell University came together to burn their draft cards in a Maxwell House coffee can. Surrounded by their friends who linked arms to protect them, the men began burning their cards. Others rushed in to join them, holding their burning cards up in the air. Watching this were police, FBI men, newsreel cameramen, reporters, photographers and passers-by. Uniformed Green Beret Army reservist Gary Rader walked to the center and burned his draft card. The 23-year-old was arrested by FBI agents several days later at his home in Evanston, Illinois. Time magazine estimated 75 total cards; participant Martin Jezer wrote that there were about 158 cards burnt in all. Future Youth International Party leader Hoffman was in attendance. The reports of this large protest were discussed by the leaders of the Spring Mobilization Conference, a march of 150,000 people led by Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Dr. Benjamin Spock starting from Sheep Meadow. The May conference developed into the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, known as The Mobe. In January 1968, Spock was indicted on charges of encouraging draft evasion, with the Boston 5. He was convicted on July 10, 1968. The charges were overturned on appeal in July 1969. In May 1967 in response to the Sheep Meadow demonstration, 56-year-old anarchist intellectual Paul Goodman published a piece in The New York Review of Books sympathetic to both public and private draft card burning. The editors printed a salvo of responses. One from Ann D. Gordon, a doctoral student of American history, said that private, individual acts of card burning were useless in stopping the war. Jezer wrote a letter thanking Goodman for his support and, as an eye witness, corrected him on certain details. Jezer said the FBI arrested only Rader; other participants were merely visited by FBI agents. Goodman's article exhorted his readers to massive direct action in draft resistance; in response, folk singer Robert Claiborne wrote to the Review to say that Goodman's plan would \\"check the growth of the peace movement and markedly reduce prospects for ending the war.\\" Claiborne asserted that the \\"great majority\\" of Americans were \\"squares\\" over 30 and not in favor of war protest even though they were likely interested in \\"ending the slaughter of their sons and other people‚Äôs sons.\\" October 16, 1967, was a day of widespread war protest organized by The Mobe in 30 cities across the US, with some 1,400 draft cards burned. At the Unitarian Arlington Street Church in Boston, draft registrants were given the opportunity to turn in their draft cards to be sent as a package to Selective Service as an act of civil disobedience against the war. Those offering their draft cards split into two groups: a group of 214 turned in their cards, and 67 chose to burn their cards. These 67 used an old candle from prominent Unitarian preacher William Ellery Channing to supply the flame. One woman, Nan Stone, burned a draft card belonging to Steve Paillet‚Äîthe 1965 law allowed for anyone to be punished for draft-card burning, even someone who was not registered for the draft. Stone later typed up the information from the 214 turned-in cards to serve as a database of war resisters. She found that the average and median age of the men was 22, and that three out of four came from Harvard, Yale, or Boston University. At San Francisco's Federal Building on December 4, 1967, some 500 protesters witnessed 88 draft cards collected and burned. About 1,000 draft cards were turned in on April 3, 1968, in nationwide protests organized by The Mobe. In Boston, 15,000 protesters watched 235 men turn in their draft cards. War protesters were increasingly choosing the more profound act of turning in their draft cards, an act which gave the government the name and address of the protester. Burning the draft card destroyed the evidence, and by this time was seen as less courageous. Reactions =Within the anti-war movement= Even some supporters of the anti-war movement, such as William Sloane Coffin, expressed concern that the tactic was \\"unnecessarily hostile.\\"‚ÄúInterview with William Sloane Coffin, 1982.‚Äù, August 30, 1982. WGBH Media Library & Archives. Retrieved November 9, 2010. =High media exposure= Many in America were not happy with the draft-card burners, or with the frequent depiction of them in the media. Joseph Scerra, national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, spoke against what he saw as too much news coverage: \\"All of our young people are not burning up their draft cards. All of our young people are not tearing up the flag. All of our youth are not supporting North Vietnam and carrying Viet Cong flags.\\"Foley, 2003, p. 118 In October 1967 at a rally in support of the government a news photograph was snapped of a man kissing his draft card, his girlfriend smiling at his side. In Playboys November 1967 issue, Playboy Playmate Kaya Christian wrote that her \\"turn-offs\\" were \\"hypocrites\\" and \\"draft card burners\\". Leftist Ramparts magazine showed four draft cards being burned on the December 1967 cover. The Saturday Evening Post, a conservative publication, put an image of draft card burning on their cover, January 27, 1968. In 1967 off-Broadway and 1968 on Broadway and in London's West End, the musical Hair featured a climactic scene in Act I of a group of men in a hippie \\"tribe\\" burning their draft cards while the main character Claude struggles with the decision to join them. Later, when the musical was staged in Yugoslavia, the draft-card burning scene was removed, as the local protesting youth viewed their army positively as a vehicle to fight for independence against the Soviet Union. =Framing the movement= President Johnson spoke strongly against the draft- card protesters, saying in October 1967 that he wanted the \\"antidraft movement\\" investigated for Communist influences. Reporting on his reaction, The New York Times presented the protests as being against the draft rather than the war. Many commentators focused on draft resistance as an explanation rather than the more challenging war resistance: the main concern of the protesters. =Political impact= In 1968 when Richard Nixon was running for President, he promised to make the military into a purely volunteer force. In this he was following others who had suggested such a strategy, including Donald Rumsfeld of the Republican Wednesday Group the year before. At the beginning of his second term as President, Nixon stopped the draft after February 1973. The last man to be drafted entered the US Army on June 30, 1973.

It is situated on Gold Creek in an area north of Icy Gulch, and approximately north of Gastineau Peak. A trail from Juneau leads directly to the mountainside. The basin was the site of the earliest gold discovery in the Juneau area, leading to the establishment of the town called Juneau. Etymology There are opposing theories as to who named the basin. One version states that it was named by Richard Harris after the mine in Silver Bow, Montana. Another theory is that it was named by a party of Montana miners in honor of their last camp in Montana. History Placer was found in the basin's Gold Creek in 1880 by Richard Harris and Joe Juneau. This gold discovery led to the creation of the town called Juneau. Over the next nine years, sluicing operations recovered thousands of ounces of gold. Sitka engineer George E. Pilz is closely connected to development in the basin, as well as having grubstaked the prospectors Harris and Juneau. By the end of the decade, large scale hydraulic mining was in operation. The mines were reached by a wagon road that zig-zagged across the hill. Alaska Perserverance Co. mine and buildings at Silverbow Basin, August 1910 Both quartz and placer mines operated in the basin, but because of climatic conditions, it was impossible to carry on milling operations in the basin itself for more than five or six mouths during the year. The largest of the mines was the Perseverance. The Fuller First Mine was the first quartz location in the basin. In 1890, Archie Campbell installed a revolving Dodge mill on the Fuller First. Over fifty placer claims on the basin's level floor were owned by the Silver-Bow Basin Mining Company, of Boston, while the Eastern Alaska Mining and Milling Company's mill was at the extreme end of the basin. In 1890, the Silver Bow Basin Mining Company properties were transferred to the Nowell Gold Mining Company, which worked the placer deposits until 1902. In 1897, the Alaska- Juneau Gold Mining Company incorporated and it purchased over two dozen claims in the basin between the Perseverance and Ebner mines in order to lode mine their low grade gold ore. The Lervey Basin placer claim was opened in 1899 a mile above Silver Bow Basin. In 1915, it was reported that a tunnel was being driven through the ridge between Sheep Creek and Silver Bow Basin, to connect with a crosscut from the shaft on the thirteenth level. The purpose of the tunnel was to transport mined ore to the mills on the Gastineau Channel. Total production estimates exceed of gold. A parish of the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, mother church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Juneau, was created in 1885 for the growing mining community. Geography Map of the Gold Creek area showing the location of the Perseverance shaft (top right) A glacier, which formerly extended to the mouth of Gold Creek and built up the moraines, excavated the depression that forms the basin. Subsequently, it was occupied by a lake that was separated from the lower portions of the creek by a solid rock divide. Lurvey Creek forks into North Lurvey Creek and East Lurvey Creek above the basin. The basin's lake beds are auriferous. Although the creek was filled with ice, there are patches near the basin which were not subjected to glaciation. The postglacial lake basin is filled with gravels from several creeks including Gold, Icy, Lurvey, Nugget, as well as Quartz Gulches. The basin ores are principally gold with small amounts of silver, zinc, or lead. Granite rocks are located in the northwestern part of the basin.

Photographer: William Henry Jackson. (example of Colorado photographs) Colorado 1870‚Äì2000 is a pictoral history of frontier Colorado consisting of repeat photography by photographers William Henry Jackson and John Fielder. This book is also a collaboration with the Colorado Historical Society.  Jackson - Nineteenth Century  William Henry Jackson Jackson started photographing Colorado for the Hayden Survey to map the West in 1870. Jackson owned his own photography studio in Denver, which enabled him to make contacts with railroad companies. Jackson traveled all over the Colorado territory and later, the state of Colorado, for over 30 years. He even climbed Rocky Mountains peaks that are over 14,000 feet high in to capture his photographs for the survey. Jackson's photographs also depict various Colorado geological characteristics such as boulders and creeks. Due to the lack of railroads, Jackson did not photograph the eastern plains and northwestern Colorado. Jackson later sold his business and the negatives from his photos to a photography company in Detroit when Colorado's economy declined in the late 1890s.  Fielder - Twentieth Century  Fielder has a long history of being a nature photographer, with his focus primarily on landscapes and nature of Colorado. Fielder had his own collection of old photographs which gave him the idea to follow in the footsteps of another historical photographer of Colorado landscapes. Fielder worked with the Colorado Historical Society which had a large collection of Jackson's photographs taken a century earlier. The historical society liked Fielder's concept to rephotograph the areas of Colorado that Jackson had traveled to and worked in collaboration with Fielder for the project. Jackson took thousands of photographs throughout his Colorado travels so it was an enormous challenge for Fielder to narrow down 300 photos that he would rephotograph from 1997-1998. Fielder used Jackson's pictures to assist him with finding the location from Jackson's pictures, which often was a challenge since some geological landmarks changed over a century. Fielder photographed the same landmarks and scenery that Jackson using the same lighting and the same view as Jackson, only a century later. Fielder states that he could not find evidence left behind by Jackson of the spots where he took his photos, although other local photographers found imprints in the ground from Jackson's equipment.Quillen, Ed.

History The band initially formed to play one single show and sneak into Millennium celebrations hosted by Exeter Cavern Club for free. Although they had no name at the time, the group appeared at the event unbilled and ended their set proclaiming \\"Thanks a lot Exeter, we've been YOUNG CHURCH!\\". After the show they decided to continue and changed their name to Kids Near Water. =Extended Player One, Mosh & Go and There Is no I In Team EPs (2000-2001)= Signed to Firefly Recordings their debut EP, Extended Player One being the label's first release. The EP was recorded by former Understand member John Hannon in Essex and was awarded 5 K's in Kerrang! as well as a favourable review in NME. Monk Dave, famous cross dressing, pro Bnp Editor of the UK punk-zine Fracture described the release as \\"quite simply the best demo I have ever heard\\". In October 2001, the band's track \\"Distance Over Time\\" appeared alongside Jimmy Eat World, Stapleton and San Quentin on the Fierce Panda Records release Mosh & Go. The band's third release was recorded by former PJ Harvey producer Head in Glastonbury, Somerset and released by Firefly Recordings in November 2001. The same year, the band toured with the punk band Elliot, opened the Concrete Jungle stage at the Reading Festival in August and ended the year with a home-town Christmas show at the Exeter Cavern Club. The show was dubbed the 'Freakscene KKKKKristmas party' because the line up, which also included Exeter punk bands Tyler and Shoe! had each scored high marks with their debut releases in Kerrang! magazine that year. =¬°Hey Zeus! (2003)= The band's debut album, recorded by John Hannon was released by Firefly Recordings in 2003. =Cave Bear Is Flying Panda LP and 'Kids Near Water / The Coalfield / America Is Waiting' split EP (2005)= The band appeared on a three-way split release with The Coalfield and America Is Waiting ahead of their second album. The band have become seemingly inactive since the release of the album Cave Bear Is Flying Panda in early 2005 and members have not continued musical projects since. Artwork for the release was done by former 2000 AD artist Shaky Kane. Touring The band toured with Hundred Reasons, Garrison, Hell Is For Heroes and played shows with Fugazi, Sum 41, Dead Inside, Copperpot Journals, Jerry Built, Tyler, Shoe!

Jo Stafford began her solo singing career after success with the big band group known as The Pied Pipers. Arrangements for the program were handled by Stafford's husband, Paul Weston, himself a conductor and arranger at Capitol Records and Columbia Records. The series aired on Tuesday evenings at 7:45 Eastern Time after Douglas Edwards with the News and preceding the half-hour The Red Skelton Show. Singer Perry Como had a similar 15-minute program on CBS in the same time slot on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings. Paul Weston wrote a special theme song for the show. Studio audience ticket from the program, 1954. The show had the same cast of regular performers Stafford worked with during her Chesterfield Supper Club shows from Hollywood. Paul Weston and his Orchestra and the Starlighters provided the music and vocal accompaniments on the television show just as they had done on Stafford's hosted \\"Supper Club\\" radio programs. The television program was done live. During the year it aired, an episode featured loss of her skirt on one show while singing \\"Let Me Go, Lover!\\". One of the cast members tripped, and as he fell, a button on his coat caught in Stafford's costume. Her skirt falling along with the actor, Stafford tried holding onto it while singing \\"Let me go\\". The decision to end Stafford's television program was not hers, but that of CBS. At the time of the cancellation, the show's sponsor, Gold Seal Company, contemplated moving the Stafford program to NBC. The loss of the television show was another factor in Stafford's move from Columbia Records, owned by CBS, back to Capitol Records, where she had her first solo recording contract. Stafford received an Emmy nomination in 1955 as Best Female Singer for her work on the program. Stafford was born in Coalinga, California. Though she had been trained as a teenager in opera, she instead joined her two sisters, Christine and Pauline, to form the Stafford Sisters vocal group. One reason for her shift away from opera was the decline in popularity of that genre during the Great Depression. Her career spanned five decades from the late 1920s to the early 1960s. From 1949 until 1953, Stafford made at least four hundred broadcasts for Radio Luxembourg and the Voice of America. In 1961, Stafford also had a short-lived series of musical specials on British television, with American and British guests. The Jo Stafford Show aired during a period when 15-minute prime time programs were relatively common. Such offerings began as early as the 1948‚Äì1949 television season, but they had largely disappeared by the time of the 1957‚Äì1958 season.Alex McNeil, Total Television, appendix, network television schedules References External links * 1954 American television series debuts 1955 American television series endings 1950s American variety television series CBS original programming Black-and-white American television shows English-language television shows Jo Stafford ","title":"The Jo Stafford Show (1954 TV series)"},{"id":"31159481","title":"2011 Regional League Division 2 Southern Region"},{"id":"31159488","text":"Lower Seletar is a subzone located in the northern part of Singapore, situated within the town of Yishun.

Founded in 2007, the organization is based in Washington D.C. and is funded by donations. History DVNF was founded in the fall of 2007 by six women veterans and State Women Veterans Coordinators to expand their scope of work within the veterans' community. The Foundation aims to serves the needs of veterans, including homeless veterans, women veterans, and veterans who experience posttraumatic stress disorder, brain injuries and invisible disabilities. According to their website, the group aims to \\"change the lives of men and women who came home wounded or sick after defending our safety and our freedom.\\" Disbursement of funds The Disabled Veterans National Foundation has provided $1 million in aid for nearly 23,000 veterans in six states. The foundation sent goods to centers in California, Houston, Knoxville, and Kansas City including spring water, men's shirts, bananas, paper towels and work gloves. The organization has worked to lobby congress to pass a bill helping homeless veterans gain access to housing and homeless assistance programs. CharityWatch announced in 2010 that less than one percent of monies collected by the charity went to veterans groups. subsequently the organization has received an F rating for is transparency and performance. A 2012 CNN investigation that aired on Anderson Cooper 360¬∞ alleged that after reviewing DVNF's annual tax returns the organization spent more than one dollar on fund raising expenses for each dollar raised. The investigative report further highlighted that the few material products or goods given to veterans groups were items such as football pants, chef jackets and thousands of Coconut M&M;'s. According to the Disabled Veterans National Foundation, in March 2010, the board of directors commissioned Professor Richard Harold Steinberg to do an analysis to determine whether their approach was working, after an initial investigation by CNN. DVNF says that Steinberg found no cause of concern regarding misrepresentation to potential donors. In May 2012, Senator Max Baucus, chair of the Senate Finance Committee and Senator Richard Burr of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs stated they are investigating DVNF following the CNN report. The open letter to DVNF contained 14 questions about their tax-exempt status and fundraising activities.http://philanthropy.com/article/Senators-Investigate/131965/ Senators Investigate Charity via The Chronicle of Philanthropy As of 2019, the Disabled Veterans National Foundation has not responded to written Better Business Bureau requests for accountability information beyond that typically included in financial statements and government filings, in order to demonstrate transparency and strengthen public trust in the charitable sector.http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/veterans-and- military/disabled-veterans-national-foundation-in-washington-dc-18693 According to the charity watchdog group, the American Institute of Philanthropy, the Disabled Veterans National Foundation is, \\"contractually obligated to allow another fundraising company it hired, Brickmill Marketing Services to keep 100% of what it raises from donors until the charity's debts to this company [Brickmill Marketing Services] are paid off.\\" The Institute found that the Disabled Veterans National Foundation has obscene fundraising costs, needing up to 98 cents to raise every dollar. =Settlement with New York Attorney General= New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman signed a settlement with DVNF and its professional fundraising consultants on June 30, 2014. The settlement included fines that the state Attorney General called the \\"largest amount of financial relief ever obtained for deceptive charitable fundraising,\\" and was widely covered in the news media. One consulting firm, Quadriga Art LLC, paid $9.7 million in damages, and another, Convergence Direct Marketing, paid $300,000. Quadriga also agreed to pay restitution to DVNF in the form of nearly $13.8 million in debt forgiveness. For its part, DVNF agreed to replace most of its fundraising consultants, to recruit new board members, and to prevent misrepresentations in future fundraising solicitations. Board members In April 2010, Precilla Wilkewitz, a Vietnam War veteran who served from 1966 to 1969, was named President of the veterans group. She replaced DVNF co-founder Delilah Washburn who died in April 2010. Wilkewitz is also the State Quarter Master Adjutant for the Louisiana Veterans of Foreign Wars. In 2005, Wilkewitz was reappointed by Louisiana Governor Kathleen B. Blanco to serve on the Louisiana Veterans Affairs Commission for a six-year term, ending in 2011. Under the direction of Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, she helped them orchestrate the first Annual Women Veterans Forum to educate women veterans about VA entitlements. In December 2012, DVNF announced the addition of Steve Weyher and Mike McNaughton to its board of directors. Steve Weyher is a Vietnam veteran of the U.S. Army who served until 1971.

The method is sometimes called minor loop synthesis in college textbooks, some government documents. The method is suitable for design by graphical methods and was used before digital computers became available. In World War 2 this method was used to design Gun laying control systems. It is still used now, but not always referred to by name. It is often discussed within the context of Bode plot methods. Minor loop feedback can be used to stabilize opamps. Example =Telescope position servo= Angular position servo and signal flow graph. Œ∏C = desired angle command, Œ∏L = actual load angle, KP = position loop gain, VœâC = velocity command, VœâM = motor velocity sense voltage, KV = velocity loop gain, VIC = current command, VIM = current sense voltage, KC = current loop gain, VA = power amplifier output voltage, LM = motor inductance, IM = motor current, RM = motor resistance, RS = current sense resistance, KM = motor torque constant (Nm/amp), T = torque, M = moment of inertia of all rotating components Œ± = angular acceleration, œâ = angular velocity, Œ≤ = mechanical damping, GM = motor back EMF constant, GT = tachometer conversion gain constant,. There is one forward path (shown in a different color) and six feedback loops. The drive shaft assumed to be stiff enough to not treat as a spring. Constants are shown in black and variables in purple. Intentional feedback is shown with dotted lines. This example is slightly simplified (no gears between the motor and the load) from the control system for the Harlan J. Smith Telescope at the McDonald Observatory. In the figure there are three feedback loops: current control loop, velocity control loop and position control loop. The last is the main loop. The other two are minor loops. The forward path, considering only the forward path without the minor loop feedback, has three unavoidable phase shifting stages. The motor inductance and winding resistance form a low-pass filter with a bandwidth around 200 Hz. Acceleration to velocity is an integrator and velocity to position is an integrator. This would have a total phase shift of 180 to 270 degrees. Simply connecting position feedback would almost always result in unstable behaviour. Current control loop The innermost loop regulates the current in the torque motor. This type of motor creates torque that is nearly proportional to the rotor current, even if it is forced to turn backward. Because of the action of the commutator, there are instances when two rotor windings are simultaneously energized. If the motor was driven by a voltage controlled voltage source, the current would roughly double, as would the torque. By sensing the current with a small sensing resister (RS) and feeding that voltage back to the inverting input of the drive amplifier, the amplifier becomes a voltage controlled current source. With constant current, when two windings are energized, they share the current and the variation of torque is on the order of 10%. Velocity control loop The next innermost loop regulates motor speed. The voltage signal from the Tachometer (a small permanent magnet DC generator) is proportional to the angular velocity of the motor. This signal is fed back to the inverting input of the velocity control amplifier (KV). The velocity control system makes the system 'stiffer' when presented with torque variations such as wind, movement about the second axis and torque ripple from the motor. Position control loop The outermost loop, the main loop, regulates load position. In this example, position feedback of the actual load position is presented by a Rotary encoder that produces a binary output code. The actual position is compared to the desired position by a digital subtracter that drives a DAC (Digital-to-analog converter) that drives the position control amplifier (KP). Position control allows the servo to compensate for sag and for slight position ripple caused by gears (not shown) between the motor and the telescope =Synthesis= The usual design procedure is to design the innermost subsystem (the current control loop in the telescope example) using local feedback to linearize and flatten the gain. Stability is generally assured by Bode plot methods. Usually, the bandwidth is made as wide as possible. Then the next loop (the velocity loop in the telescope example) is designed. The bandwidth of this sub-system is set to be a factor of 3 to 5 less than the bandwidth of the enclosed system. This process continues with each loop having less bandwidth than the bandwidth of the enclosed system. As long as the bandwidth of each loop is less than the bandwidth of the enclosed sub-system by a factor of 3 to 5, the phase shift of the enclosed system can be neglected, i.e. the sub-system can be treated as simple flat gain. Since the bandwidth of each sub-system is less than the bandwidth of the system it encloses, it is desirable to make the bandwidth of each sub-system as large as possible so that there is enough bandwidth in the outermost loop. The system is often expressed as a Signal-flow graph and its overall transfer function can be computed from Mason's Gain Formula.

Ray Smith (May 1, 1915 ‚Äì June 28, 1999, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States) was a long-time baseball executive, best known for his ownership of the minor- league Tulsa Oilers franchise, which he later moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where the team set minor league attendance records.\\"Ex-baseball owner Smith dies\\", Tulsa World, June 29, 1999. Biography Born in Dugger, Indiana, he played football at, and received a business administration degree from, Indiana University. With Clint Murchison, he co-founded Tecon Industries, a construction company predecessor of Standard Industries. He supervised the company's role in major construction projects around the world, including the St. Lawrence Seaway and the widening of the Panama Canal. During World War II, he was a colonel in the 8th Air Force Corps of Engineers. He moved to Tulsa in 1958, and bought out Murchison's interest in Standard Industries in 1961. In February of that same year, he got wind that Tulsa Oilers owner Grayle Howlett was about to move the team to Albuquerque. Smith persuaded Howlett to sell him a stake in the team for $25,000. A few months later, in July 1961, he bought out Howlett's interest and became sole owner. The Oilers moved from the AA Texas League to the AAA Pacific Coast League in 1966. He contributed to the revival of the American Association in 1969 and moved the Oilers to that league. From 1963 to 1966, he also owned one-tenth of the Cleveland Indians, a Major League Baseball team. During Smith's ownership, the Oilers won five league titles (two Texas League, one PCL, two AA), but struggled with the deteriorating condition of their aging stadium, Oiler Park. Smith had poured significant resources into Oiler Park at something approaching AAA standards, but it was apparent that the 43-year-old facility was nearing the end of its useful life. Unable to secure public support in Tulsa to replace or rebuild the ballpark, Smith ultimately moved the Oilers to New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1977, renaming the team the New Orleans Pelicans, and then to Springfield, Illinois, in 1978 as the Springfield Redbirds. After the 1981 season, he again moved the team, to Louisville, Kentucky, where they became the Louisville Redbirds (later the Louisville RiverBats and now the Louisville Bats). The team was a great success in Louisville, setting minor league attendance records. Smith was named Executive of the Year by The Sporting News in 1983. In 1985, he bid on the Cincinnati Reds, however he was outbid by Marge Schott. After the 1986 season, Smith sold the Redbirds. He then attempted to bring baseball to St. Petersburg, Florida, but was unable to bring that goal to fruition. He also served on the board of the Anaheim Angels for seven years.

The dam created Lake Marathon for the primary purpose of municipal water supply. Constructed between 1926 and 1929, it was the sole supplier of water to Athens until 1959. The dam is often cited for its role in the modernization of Greece and the first recorded case of seismic activity associated with reservoir inundation. It was also designed to be symbolic of Ancient Greece, particularly Athenians and the Battle of Marathon. Background The Marathon Dam was originally proposed, designed, funded and tendered in 1918, but was declared illegal by Prime Minister Dimitrios Gounaris, who succeeded Eleftherios Venizelos in late 1920, because there had been no public bidding for the project. With a strong influx of Greek refugees from Asia Minor following the defeat at the Greco-Turkish War of 1919‚Äì1922 (the \\"Asia Minor Disaster\\") and the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which led to the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, Greek officials were searching for a means to supply Athens with more water. An estimated 1.3 million refugees were returning and the population of Athens would end up doubling between 1920 and 1928. At the time, Greece underwent a period of political turmoil that saw the fall of the monarchy and the establishment of a Second Hellenic Republic, as well as several military coups and counter-coups. Near the end of this period, all major water supply projects for Athens were reevaluated and a five-volume report was published. The report described the Marathon Dam as \\"the optimal solution\\" and the \\"last recourse\\" for Athens. The dam was approved in 1923 and was to be implemented immediately. After a restricted public bidding, Ulen & Co. from New York City was selected to construct the project. On December 22, 1924, Ulen signed a contract with the Greek government and the Bank of Athens to construct the dam. This included the dam, reservoir, a conveyance pipe and a water treatment plant. The Greek parliament also approved the project and legislated the creation of the Hellenic Water Company (EEY) to oversee construction and manage water for Athens, amongst other Greek cities. The project's cost exceeded that of the National Bank of Greece and was funded with a $10 million loan to be repaid to Ulen, who had considerably more financial backing to complete the average-sized project. Under EEY, a Ulen- controlled consortium with the Bank of Athens and the Greek Government was formed. Construction The foundation stone for the dam was laid in October 1926 by Prime Minister Alexandros Zaimis; Venizelos was also present at the ceremony. With 450 workers, construction continued on the dam and water network for three years and in 1929, the reservoir began to fill. Work on the dam and water network was complete in May 1931. A year after inauguration, the Boyati Tunnel was transferring per second of water treated at the Galatsi Water Treatment Plant to Athens. The dam would serve as the primary water supply for Athens until 1959, when water was pumped from Yliki lake. Seismicity During and after the filling of the Marathon Dam's reservoir, there was seismic activity, with all the epicenters being within of the reservoir. The first earthquakes were felt in 1931, with two 5MW+ earthquakes occurring in 1938. All but two of the earthquakes were believed to have occurred during rapid rises in the reservoir level. This seismic activity is the earliest known example of earthquakes being caused by reservoir filling. Design The dam is a tall, long gravity dam with a crest width of and base width of . The dam's spillway is located near its southern abutment and is an uncontrolled chute-type with a discharge capacity. It is at an elevation of above sea level while the dam crest is at .

The reservoir has a maximum depth of and surface area of The dam is located at the head of a drainage area with an average annual run-off of , of which is captured. Average rainfall in the basin is . =Symbolism= The Marathon Dam was seen as a major symbol of modernization in Greece. The dam's location near Marathon signified a connection to Greece's past with the Athenians' victory at the Battle of Marathon, while its modern structure, the largest project in the Balkans at the time, signified a connection to the future and victory over nature. A replica of the Athenian Treasury temple at Delphi constructed at the base of the dam further illustrates the connection. A plaque on the temple reads: > \\"To commemorate their victory at the battle of Marathon, the Athenians > erected a treasury at Delphi. This building is a replica and commemorates a > victory at Marathon in wrestling from nature its life giving water for the > citizens of Athens.\\" The dam's face and visible structure were also covered in the same Pentelikon marble that was used to construct the Parthenon.

Osip Solomonovich Minor (; ; 1861‚Äì1932) was a Russian revolutionary and member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. Minor was born in Minsk (now in Belarus, then part of Minsk Governorate, Russian Empire). His father was Rabbi Solomon Minor, and many of his ancestors had been rabbis as well. Revolutionary politics Minor became involved in revolutionary politics while studying at the University of Moscow. He joined the party of 'People's Will' in the early 1880s. In 1883 he was arrested for the first time, and again in 1885. In 1887 he received a sentence of ten years hard labour in Siberia. On 22 March 1889 he participated in a prisoners' uprising in Yakutsk and was condemned to death by hanging, but the sentence was commuted to hard labour for life. In 1896 he was released but forbidden to live in European Russia. That restriction was eased in 1898; he was merely forbidden to live in St. Petersburg or Moscow. Vilna revolutionary movement Around 1900 he settled in Vilna (now Vilnius in Lithuania). He became active in the revolutionary movement in Vilna, but gravitated toward Narodnik circles rather than to the Marxist Bund because they seemed to him to be more revolutionary. He was affiliated with the mainly Jewish Socialist- Revolutionary Workers' Party for the Political Liberation of Russia, organised by Mark Natanson. PSR In 1901, Minor travelled abroad and assisted in the unification of various Socialist-Revolutionary groups in the Socialist- Revolutionary Party (PSR). He returned to Russia and worked for the PSR in various capacities and participated in the Revolution of 1905. In 1909, Evno Azev, head of the PSR's 'Combat Organisation' and an agent of the Okhrana (secret police), betrayed Minor and had him arrested again, but by 1913 Minor had escaped from Siberia and was in Geneva, Switzerland, working with the organisation of Russian Socialis-Revolutionries Abroad. He seems to have returned to Russia but was captured. He was freed by the February Revolution of 1917. World War I During the First World War Minor took a Defencist position, which put him at odds with the PSR leader Viktor Chernov and with his old associate Natanson. In 1917 Minor became president of the Moscow City Duma. He opposed the Bolshevik October Revolution and supported attempts to set up an anti-Bolshevik democratic government. Later years Minor left Russia in 1919. He settled in Paris, remained active in the community of Russian exiles and edited the journal Volia Rossii (Russian Will), together with V. M. Zenzinov and V. I. Lebedev. In 1921 he was one of the authors of an expos√© of the Kronstadt rebellion and its suppression by the Bolsheviks, The Truth about Kronstadt. Minor also served as chairman of the Society for Assistance to Exiles and Political Prisoners in Russia. Among his close friends was Ilya Fondaminsky ('Bunakov'), a veteran SR who later converted from Judaism to Orthodox Christianity and was murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942. He wrote his memoirs, Eto Bylo Davno (It was Long Ago), covering the pre-war period; they were published posthumously in 1933.

The film is about a young slave girl named Sarny, played by Allison Jones, who lives a hopeless life on a Southern plantation. Her job is to take care of the white family's son as well as spitting tobacco on the roses to keep bugs away. Her life is changed when she is taught how to read by a fellow slave. The slave, John, says that learning to read is freedom because slavery is bounded by laws and deeds which the slaves cannot read. Her excitement towards reading gets her and her fellow slaves in trouble with their master, Mr. Wallace, who prohibits any slave from being able to read. When trouble ensues, Sarny uses her ability to read against Mr. Wallace and saves the lives of the rest of the slaves. She ends up being sold, but not before she shows her fellow slaves the letter ‚ÄòA‚Äô. Plot Sarny, a girl, is born in a slave cabin. Her master Clel Waller is angry, saying that a boy would've been worth more. However, he doesn't sell her, as a promise has been made, so her mother is sold after a few years instead. Sarny is taken care by Delie, another slave. When Sarny grows to about pre-teenage years, she starts working at the Big House, taking care of Homer, the master's son who is not potty-trained yet. Back at the cabins, Outlaw tries to get Delie to convince Mr. Waller to give him a pass so he can marry a girl named Egypt from another plantation. Delie is preparing a dress for Sarny so she can go to work at the master's house. After a Sunday church service in which slaves and masters attend, the Wallers have guests over for lunch, among them a doctor who later has a romance with Callie, Clel's wife who, during the luncheon, talks about Outlaw wanting to court Egypt, owned by Clel's brother. Clel shuts her down stating that if they were to have a baby, it would give money to the wife's plantation instead of his. Callie asks why things cannot just be about love. Upset about Clel's decision, Sarny accidentally drops the plate of food, and is punished when Clel forces Callie to slap the girl. That night Delie tells Sarny to behave, otherwise she will have to do the hard labor out in the fields. Sarny is upset, vowing revenge on the Wallers. The next day, Callie tells Sarny to take a letter to the doctor's place. On the way, she sees a slave trader, Tom, herding black slaves toward the Waller household. At the doctor's house, the doctor asks Sarny to take a love letter to Callie, keeping it a secret from Clel. He then gives Sarny a penny for her troubles. Back at the plantation, Tom is willing to sell a slave to Clel for 500 dollars. Clel then questions Tom about why he is willing to sell a slave worth $3000 for only $500. Clel then asks the slave to take off his shirt, revealing many scars from being whipped. Clel says that instead, he will buy the man,John, off of Tom for only 50 dollars without clothes. That night, John and Sarny strike a deal, willing to trade tobacco for lessons on reading. John tells Sarny about the risks, but Sarny accepts as she wants to be free. Sarny learns the letter ‚ÄòA‚Äô. She then starts to read the letter ‚ÄòA‚Äô in the letters between the doctor and Callie that she delivers. The next morning, Outlaw is being punished because he snuck out the previous night to see Egypt. As Mr. Waller is about to whip Outlaw, Jeffrey, Clel's son, asks him to stop because they are friends. Clel say to Jeffrey that the slaves were made to pick his cotton instead of being his friend, and Outlaw is whipped. In Sarny's narration of the story, she states that Clel watched everyone instead of the one person he needed to watch, the mistress, his wife. That night when the Wallers are having a party, Delie walks in on John teaching Sarny the alphabet and is outraged. She questions John about the scars on his back, and he says that they were because he had tried to run away twice. The third time, however, he successfully got away to the North but ended up coming back in order to teach slaves how to read. Delie prohibits John from teaching Sarny to read for her safety. Sarny stalks away, stating that she will teach herself to read. John agrees but says that Delie is teaching Sarny something worse: to be afraid. Sarny later comes up with a plan for Callie to visit the Doctor secretly, offering to potty-train Homer and swipes his alphabet blocks. This angers a slave, Old Man who had had a finger chopped off after he had learned to read. John shouts out that words are freedom, that the white folks keep words to themselves and that if the slaves had words, they would be free. Later that night, John writes Sarny's name in the dirt saying that the letters meant herself. The next day, Clel recruits everyone in his family to help with picking cotton from the fields, promising a feast to everyone if they are successful with the crop. Later that day when John lovingly teaches Sarny numbers, Delie agrees to learn as well. Sarny reads the bible and is baptized. It is revealed Sarny had stolen a bible that Jeffrey, the master's other son was supposed to take care of which gets him in trouble from his father. She discovers that she had been lied to and that God was on the slave's side. As Sarny begins to read more and more, the rest of the slaves reject it and tell her to stop. She begins to read a story in the Gazette newspaper about a slave insurrection (Nat Turner's and his army of slaves), capturing the other slaves‚Äô attention. Sarny then tricks Homer into playing hide and seek so she can go back and read Clel's record book. The Waller plantation had a good crop of cotton this year and as promised, Clel throws a feast. The slaves use this opportunity to let Outlaw and Egypt get married. It is discovered later that Egypt is pregnant and is forced to run away. John forges Clel's signature for Outlaw and his wife so they can escape. Jeffrey discovers the stolen bible, and Delie takes the blame. Clel tries to figure out who had taken the bible because he knows that Delie did not know how to read. With no one confessing, Jeffrey whips Delie once. As he tries to continue, he is stopped by John who says that he was the one who took it. This results in Clel chopping off John's fingers as punishment. When asked if he had learned his lesson, John writes letters in the dirt. Jeffrey tells the overseer to take John to be sold before his father can shoot him. As he is leaving, John tells Sarny \\"when you lose one hand, the other gets stronger\\", meaning that she must forge the other note and teach other slaves how to read. John had written his name in the dirt. Sarny is then seen forging the second note for Outlaw and telling them to name their baby John if it was a boy. The next morning, Sarny tells the doctor she can no longer keep his secret. Clel interrupts the service saying that he has found two notes written and signed with his name in two different handwritings, meaning that another slave knows to write and threatens to shoot all of them. Sarny objects, saying that Clel would not shoot them because they are his only wealth. She tells Clel that she is worth the most to him because of what she knows. Callie, fearing this, ask Clel to just shoot her. The doctor intervenes, lying that he taught Egypt how to read simple things. Thinking everything has been solved, Sarny is finally sold, and as she narrates, she explains that the story is about her and Nightjohn and that there is a bit of John in all of the slaves.

Production Filmed on location in Gable, South Carolina at Rip Raps plantation, Nightjohn is a movie that depicts the lives of African American slaves in the antebellum South. Literacy plays an important part in the struggle for power between the slaves and their masters. The idea of keeping slaves illiterate was a tool for white Southerners to keep the slaves subordinate. Without the ability to read, slaves were often tricked into doing things that they did not want to do. They weren't able to read the laws or deeds that affected their future and resulted in them becoming slaves. After the civil war had ended, there was a problem pertaining to what to do for the African American people. With slavery's stabilizing influence gone, the Freedmen's Bureau was created to remedy the situation. It proposed that they should educate the former slaves and advance the reconciliation between the North and the South. They also hoped that it would create a lasting peace and order between the different races. The bureau also sought to create schoolhouses in order to regain the stability lost by the end of slavery.

The district covers from the mouth of the Chetco River south to the Oregon- California border, north to the mouth of the Pistol River, and east to the Curry-Josephine county line. The district is governed by a five-member commission elected at-large from the district population of approximately 16,000. It is the busiest recreational port on the Oregon Coast, generating more than 31,000 boat trips for more than 95,000 people, and is one of the most active harbors for Chinook salmon on the coast. Due to the unique south- facing bar orientation (as opposed to most Oregon bars facing due west) with the protection provided by Chetco Point, the Chetco bar is more passable than any other. Events The port is locally known for hosting many festivals and events, such as the Pirates of the Pacific Festival. History The port district had its beginnings in a deep-water harbor constructed in 1912 by the Brookings Lumber and Box Company, which founded and owned the company town of Brookings. In 1956, a special election was held that created the Port of Brookings Port District. Governor Elmo Smith appointed the first port commission. The Port of Brookings Harbor was severely damaged on March 11, 2011 by a tsunami caused by the T≈çhoku earthquake off the coast of Japan; damages were estimated at $6.7 million. The last boat sunk by the tsunami was raised from the bottom of the harbor on March 22. The port re-opened for business on the same day.

It is operated by and for the benefit of the Hawaii Preparatory Academy; all proceeds benefit the school's scholarship fund. In addition to its retail holdings, the center houses an expansive permanent collection of Hawaiian, Pan-Pacific, and Asian art, including the world's largest intact collection of works by Madge Tennent. Among the many major artists represented are Jean Charlot, D. Howard Hitchcock, Herb Kawainui Kane, Huc-Mazelet Luquiens, Ben Norris, Louis Pohl, Horatio Nelson Poole, Lloyd Sexton, Jr., Jules Tavernier, and Lionel Walden.  Building history  = Schoolhouse = The building was constructed in 1915 as the Waimea Elementary School. At its completion, the structure was the first public school in the historic ranching community of Waimea and among the earliest schoolhouses built in the Hawaiian plantation style. Locally, its size reflects the gradual increase in population that Waimea experienced in the early 20th century; nationally, a civic trend toward standardized American education. The original architect and contractor responsible for the schoolhouse remain unknown. In 1916, it welcomed its first students, most of them the children of Parker Ranch employees. = Military hospital = Between 1942 and 1946, the Waimea Elementary School served as a makeshift field hospital for United States Marine Corps troops stationed in or around Waimea. At the war's peak, the region was host to approximately 30,000 G.I.s operating out of Camp Tarawa; many would later contribute to major campaigns on Iwo Jima and Okinawa, two decisive installments in the Pacific theatre. = Restoration and conversion = It was restored between 2002 and 2004, with George Isaacs being the major donor. In 2003, the Historic Hawaii Foundation accorded a Historic Preservation Honor Award to the completed restoration; the building itself was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. The museum opened in 2004.  Collection  The art center's installation intermixes its own permanent art collection with loans from private collectors and works for sale. The art on display consists primarily of paintings by early and mid- twentieth century Hawaii artists. The permanent collection includes about 30 oil paintings and 40 works on paper by Madge Tennent. Other Hawaii artists represented include Jean Charlot, Martha Greenwell, D.

The series followed fictional former World Chess Champion Arkady Balagan (Shawn Doyle), a genius who uses his analytical skills to solve crimes. The show starts four months after the death of Balagan's fianc√©e Rosemary, when Balagan has developed agoraphobia. Balagan uses the faculties he honed playing chess to help him solve cases.  Cast and characters  * Shawn Doyle as Arkady Balagan ‚Äì a former world chess champion from Russia. While attending a world championship in Vancouver his fianc√©e, Rosemary, is killed by an assassin's gunfire in front of the hotel Huxley. His resultant agoraphobia makes him an \\"armchair detective\\" like Nero Wolfe or Lincoln Rhyme. Initially, he primarily makes money by charging exorbitant rates for games against \\"Grandmaster Arkady Balagan\\" on his website. * Torrance Coombs as Sam Besht ‚Äì a grad student and chess fanatic. He is Balagan's apprentice; because of Balagan's phobia Sam is the one who does the leg work to solve the cases. Sam is a smart kid with a promising future; Balagan pays Sam for his legwork by giving him more chances to play chess with Balagan. * Patrick Gallagher as Hugo ‚Äì the head of hotel security. He and Balagan have their disagreements; Hugo envies Balagan's superior capabilities solving crimes as a mere chess player while he, as a former detective, shows a lower aptitude at deduction. Hugo constantly threatens Balagan about his inability to pay his bills, and wants him to leave. Balagan deceives and outwits Hugo into helping him or staying out of his way. * Katharine Isabelle as Danni ‚Äì a bartender at the hotel. Danni serves as a source of information. * Melanie Papalia as Pippa ‚Äì younger sister of Rosemary (Balagan's deceased fianc√©e), she is determined to find out who killed Rosemary. She makes documentaries and keeps a video blog. * Carmen Aguirre as Alcina ‚Äì a cleaning lady at the Huxley Hotel. She is a single mother of six, with one grandchild, who works overtime, practically every day. She sometimes skips work time in order to do some field work with Sam, as a favour to Mr. Balagan, who tips generously. * Veena Sood as Barbara Stilwell ‚Äì the manageress of the hotel. Barbara does not help with Balagan's cases. * Collin Lawrence ‚Äì as Homicide Detective Jason Evans (recurring), the newest detective assigned by the police to investigate the murder of Pippa's older sister Rosemary (Balagan's late fianc√©e). Pippa has confidence in the detective, and that his fresh perspective on the case will enable him to solve the mystery of who murdered Rosemary. Balagan, in sharp contrast, has much less faith in the police, based on his experiences in the Soviet Union with alleged corruption and incompetence.
