The museum integrates a part of the historical city wall of Worms as well as two towers from the 12th century. The audiovisual permanent exhibition examines the mythical character of the Nibelungensage. The premises of the museum are also used for cultural events, talks and symposiums.  History   Prehistory and planning  Most of the scenes of the Song of the Nibelungs take place either in Worms itself or in its surroundings. This is also why the city plays an important role in the perception of the Nibelungenlied for centuries. Due to longstanding considerations in order to appreciate the importance of the city Worms as most important setting of the legend the city commissioned an expert opinion in July 1996. Especially one specific well preserved section of the medieval fortifications was taken into consideration. This is because of its authenticity and the convenient location between the Worms Cathedral and the Rhine promenade with its Hagendenkmal. The decision of the city council was made in February 1997 in favour of the concept of the agency Auber + Hoge & associés (A+H) in Paris.  Project implementation  According to archeological finds in the excavation area in early 1999, nothing was standing in the way of the construction of the estimated 4.5 million Euro total cost of the museum. Meanwhile, the project was facing increased criticism from parts of Worms’ public. This was reflected in a polarizing debate in local media which went on for months. A citizens' initiative brought the construction to a halt with the help of a successful public petition. In the following referendum on September 12, 1999, a majority of the voters answered “no” to the question: \\"Do you want a Nibelungen museum to be built in Worms along the city wall, which would be financed by public funding worth millions and would mean that funding for further meaningful projects would not be available anymore?\\". With 22% the participation failed to reach the required quorum of the Rheinland-Pfalz. This is why the groundbreaking ceremony could take place on November 18, 1999. The Nibelungen Museum Worms was opened on August 18, 2001 after an almost two-year construction period.  The concept  The German Nibelungen is a myth rather than a historical event and therefore original exhibits are extremely rare. A handwritten note with the Song of the Nibelungs could hardly fill a whole museum. Additionally problematic passages in the history of the Nibelungen could be overcome with the help of distant comments but this was not in the interest of the founders. The concept of new media artist Oliver Auber and the architect Bernd Hoge gives visitors insight into the medieval myth with the help of a fictional portrayal, in contrast to the old fortification. A myth is not a holistic phenomenon. Not a single, external perspective could describe it objectively. [That is why the Nibelungen Museum] is not a traditional, scientific museum, but rather an artistic creation. It provides an overview [of interpretations formed over centuries] and adds another. -The Founders A+H, Die Bleibe des unbekannten Dichters  Themed rooms  The initial spatial concept contained three rooms with dedicated to different concepts: the Tower of Visions, the Audio tower and the treasure room. The underground treasure room has been closed in 2007, due to technical reasons. Since 2008, the room contains the so-called laboratory of myths, in which visitors can once again recap their museum tour. The laboratory of myths is barrier-free. Especially visitors with health issues, who are not able to participate in the audio tour through the upper towers, can view the guided tour via monitors. With its different media techniques and a big screen, the room can be used by groups for educational purposes.  The Tower of Vision  In the Tower of Vision the visitors are presented to the main aspects of the saga, including its origins and historical context. At the same time it also traces the history of reception, which ranges from mythification to the declaration of the saga as a “national myth”. The narrator helps to “record the invisible threads, which during all the centuries linked together” [translated from German]. The Tower of Vision is installed in one of the medieval defense towers and is dominated by a high, oscillating iron pendulum in the form of a spindle, around which the spiral stairs are arranged. Glowing pictures are attached to the ribs of the sparkling, golden spindle, representing the “Rütlin” (little rod), which is the talisman of the Nibelungen treasure.  The Audio Tower  The Audio Tower is laid out as the scriptorium of the narrator. Here, visitors can sit on audio chairs and listen to passages from the original song, spoken in Middle High German and translated simultaneously. Visitors also learn about the contemporary everyday culture and high culture, which have influenced the author of the Song of The Nibelungs. Pictures, which visitors could also see in the Tower of Vision function as illustrations of the text passages and are now explained in more detail.  The Myth Lab  The “Myth Lab”, which is located in an underground room, provides visitors with the opportunity for quiet contemplation after the two-hour tour through the museum. The entire text by the anonymous poet can be accessed again here, and the Rütelin, a 17,5m column of pictures located in the Tower of Vision, is graphically depicted and can be viewed from all sides and angles. An internet search function is provided for student groups to research information for presentations or the like, and several flash movies and short documentaries can also be found there. The documentaries deal with the themes of Worms, modern and classic myths, and the Nibelungenlied. In addition, a “master terminal” and a ceiling projector provide presenters with the option of adding and presenting their own content. The “myth lab” is also used for varying special presentations.  Reception  Before the official opening of the museum the “virtual treasure” was presented on two symposia in Paris in 2000, as well as in Boston in 2001. The invitations for both symposia were sent by the Goethe Institute and the two events encountered a huge media response in France, Canada, the United States and Japan: \\"A high-tech, cutting-edge interpretation of the Nibelungen myth…\\" Boston Digital Industry: Treasure of the Nibelungs (May 2001) \\"Au-delà de la performance technique qui sait se faire oublier, les auteurs ont réussi une œuvre d'une grande poésie…\\" Libération: Tragédies en sous-sol (December 8, 2000) \\"Sitôt que l'on y entre, en sentira son rhythme, sa joie ou ses tourments.\\" Le Devoir: Un trésor virtuel sous la ville (January 20, 2001) The official opening of the museum was also regarded as a success by a number of nationwide media: \\"In the new Nibelungen Museum Worms the nebulous story is visualized. Thousands of pictures, texts and sounds result in a fantastic image of the medieval heroic epic.\\" Frankfurter Rundschau (August 11, 2001) \\"… a testimony deserving attention.\\" Frankfurter Rundschau (August 21, 2001) \\"The Nibelungenmuseum Worms virtually revives a piece of German world literature.\\" Süddeutsche Zeitung, (August 20, 2001)  Project team  * Olivier Auber (A+H): content design, museum & treasure * Bernd Hoge (A+H): architecture & exhibition * Thierry Fournier: Music, sound composition & audio editing * Emmanuel Mâa Berriet: Real time VR program (picture) * Joachim Heinzle and Olivier Auber: narrator’s text * Ursula Kraft: visual composition 'Rütelin' * Susanne Wernsing: Iconography & theme research  Controversy about the Treasure  Up to 2007, there was a virtual “Treasure Chamber” in the museum’s “Myth Lab” – a real time projection of pictures of the treasure of the Nibelungs and the city of Worms with its buildings and monuments. Beneath the chamber, the museum built the “Worldground” (Weltengrund), where new pictures and sounds were produced constantly. The pictures and structures that created the “Worldground” refer to the idea of the Poietic Generator by Olivier Auber. The management removed the installation without informing the artist.

The Governor of Kırıkkale (Turkish: Kırıkkale Valiliği) is the bureaucratic state official responsible for both national government and state affairs in the Province of Kırıkkale. Similar to the Governors of the 80 other Provinces of Turkey, the Governor of Kırıkkale is appointed by the Government of Turkey and is responsible for the implementation of government legislation within Kırıkkale. The Governor is also the most senior commander of both the Kırıkkale provincial police force and the Kırıkkale Gendarmerie. Appointment The Governor of Kırıkkale is appointed by the President of Turkey, who confirms the appointment after recommendation from the Turkish Government. The Ministry of the Interior first considers and puts forward possible candidates for approval by the cabinet. The Governor of Kırıkkale is therefore not a directly elected position and instead functions as the most senior civil servant in the Province of Kırıkkale. Term limits The Governor is not limited by any term limits and does not serve for a set length of time. Instead, the Governor serves at the pleasure of the Government, which can appoint or reposition the Governor whenever it sees fit. Such decisions are again made by the cabinet of Turkey. The Governor of Kırıkkale, as a civil servant, may not have any close connections or prior experience in Kırıkkale Province. It is not unusual for Governors to alternate between several different Provinces during their bureaucratic career. Functions The Governor of Kırıkkale has both bureaucratic functions and influence over local government. The main role of the Governor is to oversee the implementation of decisions by government ministries, constitutional requirements and legislation passed by Grand National Assembly within the provincial borders. The Governor also has the power to reassign, remove or appoint officials a certain number of public offices and has the right to alter the role of certain public institutions if they see fit. Governors are also the most senior public official within the Province, meaning that they preside over any public ceremonies or provincial celebrations being held due to a national holiday. As the commander of the provincial police and Gendarmerie forces, the Governor can also take decisions designed to limit civil disobedience and preserve public order. Although mayors of municipalities and councillors are elected during local elections, the Governor has the right to re-organise or to inspect the proceedings of local government despite being an unelected position.

He served from 1955 to 1957 and again from 1963 until 1984. In his last year, he was the Louisiana Senate President Pro Tempore. Background Hickey was the youngest of five children of George Fulton Hickey (1879-1936), a New Orleans firefighter, and Mary Karcher Hickey (1881-1961), a daughter of Paul Bernard and Margaret Conrad Karcher. Hickey and his wife, the former Henrietta Miller (1909-1997), were living at 1833 Mandeville Street in New Orleans in the 1940 census. The Hickeys lost a teenaged son, Theodore T. Hickey (1936-1953), who was born the year that his paternal grandfather died. The Hickeys, their son, and his mother are entombed along Crucifixion Walk at Saint Roch Cemetery No. 1 in New Orleans. His father, George Hickey, is interred at St. Vincent de Paul Cemetery No. 2, also in New Orleans. Political life Hickey was the author in 1956 of the act which established the University of New Orleans. At the time New Orleans was the largest metropolitan area in the United States without a public university though it had several private universities, such as Tulane, Loyola, and Dillard. The institution was originally named Louisiana State University in New Orleans but renamed in 1973. The UNO University Ballroom at was named in Hickey's honor late in 2014, more than two decades after his death. Hickey was also a master of moving legislation to passage. Henry Braden, an African- American colleague from New Orleans, said: \\"He could let the debate go back and forth, then take the mike and put everything in perspective. He would prod our conscience and put a stop to some things.\\" Between his two stints in the state Senate, Hickey was a member of the New Orleans City Council during the administrations of Mayors deLesseps Story Morrison and Victor Schiro. He represented District E from 1958 to 1961 and replaced Schiro on the council at-large when Schiro succeeded to the office of mayor upon Morrison's resignation to become United States Ambassador to the Organization of American States. Schiro was then elected in 1962. Hickey's council colleagues included later Lieutenant Governor Jimmy Fitzmorris and future Civil Court Judge Fred J. Cassibry.

Involved with the Franco- Polish intelligence unit F2 from November 1941, she was arrested in Paris in July 1944 by the Gestapo, then tortured and deported to the Ravensbrück women concentration camp. Dior was subsequently forced to work in the Torgau military prison, in the Buchenwald's satellite camp of Abberode, and finally in a factory near Leipzig. After her release in April 1945, she was awarded several medals of honour for her acts in the Resistance, most notably the Croix de Guerre, the King's Medal for Courage in the Cause of Freedom, and the Legion of Honour. After the end of the war, Dior spent the remainder of her life working with flowers: first as a flower trader in Paris, then as a flower farmer in Provence for the production of fragrance. She was close to her brother, the well-known couturier Christian Dior. Launched in 1947, the perfume Miss Dior is often said to have been named after her by Christian. Catherine Dior helped preserve her brother's legacy after his death in 1957, and she became the honorary president of the from 1999 to her death in 2008, aged 90.  Biography   Early life and family  Catherine's father Maurice Dior (1872–1946). Pictured c. 1900. Ginette Dior – who later took the name Catherine – was born in Granville, Normandy on 2 August 1917, the youngest child of Maurice Dior (1872 – 1946), a fertilizer industrialist, and Madeleine Dior, née Martin (1879 – 1931). She had four siblings: Raymond – the father of Françoise Dior–, Jacqueline, Bernard, and the couturier Christian Dior. Following the bankruptcy of the Dior factories in the aftermaths of the 1929 financial crash and the death of her mother in 1931, the family settled in 1932 in Callian, near Grasse in Provence.  World War II  In November 1941, Dior met founding Resistance member Hervé des Charbonneries while shopping in Cannes. She fell in love with him; aged 36, des Charbonneries was a married man and had 3 children. Dior joined him in the Resistance in late 1941, soon after her brother Christian returned to Paris. She used Christian's apartment in Paris, located at 10 Rue Royale, to host underground Resistance meetings. Dior was involved with the \\"Massif Central\\" section of the F2 network, a British-funded Resistance intelligence unit set up by the Polish government-in-exile to operate in France. Des Charbonnies belonged to the same network and operated in the Zone Sud under the leadership of Admiral Jacques Trolley de Prévaux; Dior was in charge of transmitting clandestine reports to London. On 6 July 1944 Dior was arrested along with 26 other persons of the group, and tortured by the Gestapo. Christian tried to seek her release via the Nazi contacts he had made at his job and his relationship with the Swedish consul-general Raoul Nordling. On August 18, Nordling managed to convince the Nazis to place Catherine under the protection of the Swedish state, but she had already been deported by August 15 on one of the last prison trains leaving Paris towards the Ravensbrück women concentration camp. Trolley de Prévaux was arrested in Marseille during the same month. Dior was subsequently transferred from Ravensbrück to the military prison of Torgau and posted to the all-female \\"Anton Kommando\\" to work on the production of explosives in a disused potassium mine. She then worked in Abberode – one of Buchenwald concentration camp's satellite camps – and in an aviation factory at Leipzig- Markkleeberg, which was eventually captured by the US Army on 19 April 1945. Dior was liberated near Dresden during the same month and returned to Paris on 28 May 1945. In 1952 she testified in a trial of 14 people responsible for the office of the Gestapo held in Paris. Dior was awarded several medals of honour for her acts of resistance: the Croix de Guerre – a distinction usually reserved for regular armed forces –, the Combatant Volunteer Cross of the Resistance, the Combatant's Cross, the King's Medal for Courage in the Cause of Freedom, and was named a Chevalière of the Legion of Honour.  Miss Dior  Catherine's brother Christian Dior in his later life. Depicted of a 2005 Romanian post stamp. After the war, Dior became a \\"representative in cut flowers\\" (mandataire en fleurs coupées). During 12 years, she worked with des Charbonneries at the Halles market in Paris, trading flowers from the south of France and the French colonies. She then moved to Callian, Provence, and bought a rose farm for the production of fragrance, which she continued to exploit until her death. Christian Dior's testament will, dated 30 August 1957, bequeathed his possessions to be equally shared between his sister Catherine and Raymonde Zehnacker, his right-hand woman. He died from a heart attack on October 23 of the same year, aged 52. The fragrance Miss Dior, presented on 12 February 1947 during the first fashion show of the company, was possibly named after her. Although the relation is not mentioned by Dior's official website, the story is often mentioned by journalists. According to the legend, Catherine Dior suddenly entered the room while her brother Christian was brainstorming names for the flagrance with his muse Mitzah Bricard; \\"Ah, here's Miss Dior!\\", Bricard said, and Christian allegedly replied \\"Miss Dior: now there's a name for my perfume!\\"  Later life  In October 1963, she publicly distanced herself from her niece Françoise Dior after her wedding with British Neo-Nazi leader Colin Jordan. Dior issued a press release denouncing the \\"publicity given by the press and television to [her] niece Françoise Dior's nonsensical statements. The fame of [her] brother Christian Dior must not be used to highlight the scandal and risk tarnishing a name carried with honour and patriotism by members of my family.\\" She kept on preserving the legacy of her brother until her death. In 1999 Dior inaugurated the opening of the in Granville and became its honorary president. Catherine Dior died on 17 June 2008 in Callian aged 91. She was buried near her brother Christian.  Legacy  In September 2019, Maria Grazia Chiuri, then the creative director at Christian Dior Italy, dedicated the Spring-Summer 2020 Ready-to-Wear runway collection to Catherine Dior, inspired by her passion for flowers.

The cloverleaf model of tRNA is a model that depicts the molecular structure of tRNA. The model revealed that the chain of tRNA consists of two ends—sometimes called \\"business ends\\"—and three arms. Two of the arms have a loop, D-loop (dihydro U loop) and Tψc-loop with a ribosome recognition site. The third arm known as \\"variable arm\\" has a stem with optional loop. One end of the chains (with a double stranded structure in which the 5' and 3' ends are adjacent to each other), the amino acids acceptor stem, usually attaches to amino acids and such reactions are often catalyzed by a specific enzymes, aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. For example, if the amino acid that attach to the end is alanine, the reaction will be catalyzed by alanine-tRNA synthase to produce tRNAphe. The other end—the bottom often called the \\"DNA arm\\"—consists of a three base sequence that pairs with a complementary base sequence in a mRNA.

Early in 1837 he began the study of law in the office of the late Hon. Ambrose L. Jordan, of Hudson, N. Y. Two years later he was admitted to the bar, and began practice in Hudson, where his younger brother, David S. Cowles, was subsequently associated with him. He had attained a prominent position in the bar of Columbia County when, in 1853, he removed his office to the city of New York. In the spring of 1855 he was appointed Judge of the Supreme Court of New York. He resigned the appointment in the following winter, but was reappointed to fill a vacancy caused by the death of Judge Robert H. Morris. Subsequently, a claim having been made to the seat by Hon. Henry E. Davies by virtue of an election, Cowles retired in his favor, and was for several years occupied mainly in hearing cases as referee, but at length resumed general practice. He continued to reside in New York until about 1871, when he removed to Rye, Westchester County, where he was living at the time of his death. He left home in October 1874, for a visit to California, and there met with a slight injury, which resulted, while on his return, in his death, at Chicago, from gangrene, on December 2.

Alabama, a case filed in federal court in 1981. The suit, brought by Knight and others associated with two historically black colleges in Alabama, held that Alabama's higher education system utilized racially discriminatory practices in allocating funding and admissions practices. The State of Alabama's practices were determined to be in violation of the constitution as a result of trials in 1991 and 1995, and as a result the state was subject to monitoring by the district court. Litigation continued in the wake of the initial cases, and extended into Alabama's property tax system. The district court found that Alabama's property tax system fails to collect enough tax to adequately fund education for all of its students, which disproportionately hurts minority students. Citing the property tax system, and its practices of limiting taxation of land zoned for agriculture to an average of less than $1 per acre, the district court called it \\"a vestige of discrimination\\" that has \\"successfully used the argument that it is unfair for white property owners to pay for the education of blacks\\". Though the district court offered findings, no action was taken against the state due to its original scope focusing on higher education. A new lawsuit, called Lynch v. Alabama, has been taken up to focus on K-12 funding.

It was Osborne's final work for the theatre, the failure of which on the stage made him decide to give up play-writing. The play is a sequel to Osborne's first successful play, Look Back in Anger (1956); it portrays the life and thoughts of the central character from the earlier play, Jimmy Porter (referred to as J.P.), in middle age. Creation Osborne had been thinking about a sequel to Look Back in Anger for some years, and had been working on a draft of the play since 1987 when he started jotting down ideas and plotting it out. The play itself was written over several months in from December 1988 to April 1989. He tried out several titles, but decided on Déjàvu, \\"deliberately misspelt\\", according to John Heilpern, as a single word (rather than the correct \\"Déjà vu\\").Heilpern, John, John Osborne: A Patriot for Us, 2007, Random House, pp.446ff. Production difficulties The play was sent to Richard Eyre at the Royal National Theatre who rejected it, suggesting that it would work best as a \\"monologue performed prior to a performance of LOOK BACK IN ANGER\\". Tony Richardson, the original director of Look Back in Anger, was enthusiastic, but it was again turned down by Max Stafford-Clark at the Royal Court Theatre. Several readers took the view that it was much too long, and so should be cut. Stephen Daldry thought that Osborne would have been better advised to do a one-man show, performing Porter's rants in the play himself. Osborne approached various actors and directors but was unable to develop the production, at one point writing a bitter letter to The Times about his problems. Peter O'Toole agreed to play the main role, but dropped out after conflicts with Osborne over proposed cuts to the script. John Standing also dropped out after an argument with Osborne. Eventually Peter Egan took the role of Porter, and the play was produced in May 1992 at the Thorndike Theatre directed by Tony Palmer. The play was not a commercial success, closing after a run of seven weeks. Egan later wrote, \\"I knew the play wouldn't work but I couldn't turn it down. I knew John deserved to be presented again – and that it would be his last work...The play was a commercial failure but it reawakened people to the great energy and power of Osborne.\\" Peter Egan, \\"John Osborne: Monologue, actors on acting\\", The Guardian, 25 March 2014 The failure of the play distressed Osborne who thereafter signed himself \\"John Osborne, ex-playwright\\". The play was revived at the Comedy Theatre, Panton Street, around 1993 but closed after some weeks. Peter O'Toole and Hayley Mills were there, among many others. O'Toole walked out shouting, \\"Oi've never heard such f...…. rubbish!\\" Original cast *Peter Egan as J.P. *Gareth Thomas as Cliff *Alison Johnston as Alison Porter, J.P.'s daughter *Eve Matheson as Helena Plot Jimmy Porter (J.P.) is living with his daughter Alison, who begins the play ironing, just as her mother, also Alison, did in Look Back in Anger. J.P. and Alison argue relentlessly, as she expresses her contempt for her own misanthropic father. Jimmy's old friend Cliff tries to smooth things over, while Alison's friend Helena attempts to support her. J.P. takes consolation in his teddy bear as he objects to the vulgarisation of the English language and the corrupting influences of various social agencies. In the end, Alison walks out on her father. Critical reception Osborne and Palmer both argued that Jimmy Porter (J.P.) is essentially a \\"comedy character\\" comparable to Falstaff, whose self-aggrandising rants are not to be taken too seriously. Osborne wrote that J.P. \\"generates energy, but, also, like, say, Malvolio or Falstaff, an inescapable melancholy\\". Palmer also argued that \\"J.P. has a life-enhancing Falstaffian quality; he [Falstaff] was a coward, a braggart, a liar, totally unscrupulous, a drunk, with an inheritance, like J.P. And just like Falstaff, J.P. can stop the play dead in its tracks and say 'what is honour'\\".\\"Déjàvu\\", The Independent, 10 June 1992. The play's original reviews were mixed. The Independent noted that Jimmy's rants in the original play were exhilarating because they were transgressive, but the \\"ageing J.P. merely proves that, in less shockable times, the unspeakable is all too easily spoken\\".\\"Déjàvu\\", The Independent, 12 June 1992. Several critics complained that the play was essentially a vehicle for J.P.'s pontifications, being as, as The Sunday Times put it, \\"essentially one long speech\\".The Sunday Time, 14 June 1992. Sheridan Morley called it \\"a monologue without a play\\".Morley, Sheridan, \\"Déjàvu\\", International Herald Tribune, 17 May 1992. Sheila Stowell, in an essay on Déjàvu, comments that the play is not a \\"sequel\\" in the traditional Hollywood sense of an attempt to cash-in on an earlier success; rather it is an attempt to \\"blow up\\" the rebellious image of Look Back’s Jimmy Porter. She disputes the comparison to Falstaff because J.P.'s antagonists are all \\"sham characters\\", easily outwitted by the hero, unlike Shakespeare's play in which Falstaff's bluster is exposed for what it is.Sheila Stowell \\"Honey, I Blew up the Ego\\", Patricia D. Denison, John Osborne: A Casebook, pp.167ff. However, she argues that J.P.'s social criticisms are largely consistent with the anarchic attitudes of the 1956 Jimmy.

The relief from Auburtin's grave at Partenkirchen, which is no longer existent. Between 1911 and 1914 he worked for the Berliner Tageblatt (newspaper), based in Paris as the paper's foreign correspondent. However, in August 1914 war broke out, and he was identified as a prominent enemy alien. He was arrested and imprisoned at Dijon, in the east of France. He was then moved to a prison in Morsiglia on the island of Corsica. Here he remained till 1917, by when he was seriously ill, and the French released him. He was repatriated to Germany via Switzerland. His life in French internment was later recalled in a volume Auburtin produced in German and French entitled \\"Was ich in Frankreich erlebte\\"Was ich in Frankreich erlebte, Berlin, Mosse 1918 (\\"My experiences in France\\" / \\"Carnet d' un boche en France 1914–1917\\"). After 1917 he worked as a travel writer and freelance correspondence. Places on which he wrote included Madrid and, notably towards the end of his career, Rome. A story told – apparently by another cat lover – of his time in Rome concerns his unexpected disappearance one day. He was found in a state of mental confusion (geistig verwirrt) in Trajan's Forum, surrounded by some of the ferral cats who abound in the city. By this stage, the source asserts, he loved cats more than he loved people. Personal In 1906 Victor Auburtin married Hedwig Gudlowski. Their final years together were greatly affected by Hedwig's mental illness.Die biographischen Informationen folgen weitgehend Wilmont Haackes Vorwort zu Victor Auburtin, Schalmei. Aus dem Nachlass, Hamburg 1948 Writing Auburtin's journalism and literary work move between turn of the [nineteenth/twentieth] century literature and the \\"classic modern\\" style. Influences come both from his French ancestral provenance and his own upbringing in Prussia. His texts display an anecdotal lightness of touch, with elements of elitist Dandyism and an underlying conservatism, albeit not infrequently spiced with stark departures from the politically conservative mainstream. Auburtin was a huge admirer of the French political leader Jean Jaurès, although he completely rejected Jaurès' Socialism. With the various new artistic movements, which were a feature of the early twentieth century, he had difficulties. Unlike other conservative commentators, however, he did not campaign against artistic innovators: he viewed their outputs from a position of distanced sceptical interest, but not of unreasoned hostility. He was able to find intellectual joy in each new ideology that appeared, a tendency clearly disclosed in both the content and style of his own written commentaries and criticism.

It is the second bridge to be built at this site.  History  The first bridge was proposed in 1986, when the Town of Foster decided to build a covered bridge in honor of Rhode Island's 350th birthday. The wood was donated by Providence Water Supply. It used Town lattice trusses and was built over an existing steel bridge. Approval from the Rhode Island Department of Transportation came in 1992, and construction began on 12 September 1992. Jed Dixon was the bridge's designer, and all work was performed by volunteers. The bridge was dedicated on 23 May 1993 but was burned by vandals on September 11 of that year. There was an immediate campaign to rebuild the bridge. Twelve days after the destruction, the town council approved construction of the current bridge, which was dedicated on 5 November 1994. Structure The bridge uses an Ithiel Town lattice truss design including authentic wooden trunnels. Lengthwise planks cover the roadway area with macadam filling the gaps. The entire deck area is supported by six I-beam stringers. The bridge rests on concrete abutments which extend to form road-level wing walls. Each side has one diamond-shaped opening. A heavy curb-high timber runs along each side of the bridge, presumably to prevent vehicles from damaging the trusses.

She was a founding member of the American Iris Society. Early life and education Grace Sturtevant was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1865, one of four children of noted agronomist Edward Lewis Sturtevant (first director of the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station) and Mary Elizabeth (Mann) Sturtevant. Grace's mother died when she was only 12; her father remarried in 1883, to Mary Elizabeth's sister Hattie. Grace was close to her much younger half-brother from this second marriage, Robert Sturtevant, who also became an iris fancier as well as a landscape architect. Grace had artistic ability and as a young woman illustrated some of her father's papers on peppers and sweet potatoes. Iris breeding E. Lewis Sturtevant died in 1898, and in 1901 Grace and Robert jointly bought a property named Wellesley Gardens in Massachusetts. In 1910, Grace began hybridizing irises, beginning with varieties imported from Europe, and in 1912, her first known iris cross flowered. By 1915 Wellesley Gardens became a showcase of iris plantings and a popular local destination during bloom season. In 1917, Grace took three of her hybrids— the yellow 'Afterglow' and 'Shekinah', and the lavender 'B.Y. Morrison' (named in honor of horticulturist Benjamin Y. Morrison, the first director of the U.S. National Arboretum)—to the Massachusetts Horticultural Exhibition, where they all won medals. This striking success laid the cornerstone of her reputation as a notable iris breeder. Grace established a commercial nursery, Glen Road Iris Gardens near Wellesley Farms, Massachusetts. Between 1917 and 1920, Grace was very active as a plant breeder, introducing numerous new hybrids and issuing a commercial catalog for the first time in 1918. Other iris experts helped in the selection of varieties for her catalog, especially the British iris breeder Arthur J. Bliss, who in 1926 would name an iris 'Grace Sturtevant' in her honor. View towards the pond at Wellesley Farms, home of the iris breeder Grace Sturtevant, 1921. Grace was fascinated by the genetics of iris and in particular by the inheritance of color, which she recognized as a key factor attracting gardeners to the genus. In a period when not a great deal of work was being done in iris breeding, Grace's efforts greatly expanded the color range of yellow-tinged irises. For example, she envisioned the possibility of developing a tall yellow bearded iris from Iris pallida that could thrive in southern California where many older yellows descended from Iris variegata did not prosper. Out of this breeding program, she developed the award-winning 'Afterglow' and 'Shekinah', as well as 'Gold Imperial' (1924) and the deep- yellow 'Primrose' (1925). 'Shekinah' was praised as the best yellow iris of its day and made a list of the top 25 American irises in 1925. Most iris breeders who have worked with yellow irises since then have used it somewhere in their lineage. Other successful introductions during the 1910s and 1920s included the very popular pink-shaded 'Dream' (1918) and 'Wild Rose' (1920), the lavender 'Queen Caterina' (1918), and 'Taj Mahal', considered the best white for many years. Her cultivars ranged from the tall bearded types through intermediate and dwarf varieties and Siberian iris. Grace expressed her general philosophy of iris breeding as follows: \\"Good substance and form, attractive coloring and above all, a pleasing balance of the whole are prime requirements; height, branching and size (qualities which give balance) are merely desirable. New introductions must be distinct, preferably in color as that receives general acknowledgment.\\" She has been praised for the integrity of her approach to iris breeding, in several instances withdrawing cultivars from circulation if they did not live up to her standards. In 1932, when the American Iris Society Symposium issued new iris breeding standards, Grace suggested to growers that they discard nearly one in ten of her past introductions for a variety of reasons including weak growth, poor form, common color, or insufficient individuality. In 1920, Grace wrote in the Gardener's Chronicles that registration of new plant varieties was important in the United States. She further suggested that awards should be given to irises that thrive in gardens in preference to those seen at exhibitions. Grace was a founding member of the American Iris Society. In early 1920, she wrote a brief article in The Flower Grower urging that \\"it is high time that some central body should gather together information on Iris matters whether it is the history of our garden favorites, the records of our present varieties or the opportunities for the future... Who, as an individual, can tell which [variety] is worthwhile for his small garden? Many varieties both old and new, should be thrown into the discard and what but an association may do this without prejudice and with authority?\\" In this article, she announced the upcoming meeting in New York at which the AIS would actually be formed. In 1935, Grace was the first recipient of the AIS's Gold Medal for outstanding service, which has only been given out around a dozen times in the society's nearly one-hundred-year history. She also was awarded the British Iris Society's Foster Memorial Plaque in 1938. Due to declining health, she sold Wellesley Gardens in 1945, two years before her death in 1947.

Train of Thought is produced by Toronto's Jumblies Theatre with partners all across Canada and will be taking place May and June 2015.  History  Train of Thought was hatched by a group of artists sharing community engagement practices and projects across the country. Its focus is collaborations and alliances between First Nations and settler/immigrant artists and communities.  Themes  In developing the idea for Train of Thought, Jumblies Theatre and partners asked what theme merited such a huge cross-country undertaking, a question that led to a focus on collaborations and alliances between First Nations and settler/immigrant artists and communities: the most challenging and urgent matter that all of us are grappling with and learning about from our different regional and cultural perspectives. Thus, Train of Thought takes a counter-colonial route to collect and share stories, buried histories and imagined landscapes of the land where we live: as it might have been, as it is, as it could be: drawing on perception, memory, history and imagination; merging whimsy and serious intent, bringing together artists and community members, the land's first people and all those who have found refuge here over the years and generations.  Production  Train of Thought is an evolving community arts journey from west to east coast, with on-board activities and over stops along the way. At each stop, a travelling company will get off until the next train comes through. Local arts organizations will host interactive events, and add to creative tasks. Additional travellers will hop aboard to join in conversations and art-making en route.  Purpose  Train of Thought is less about trains than about the relationships and discoveries that the journey will enable. The tour is an imperfect and incomplete adventure - part of a longer and unending imperative to learn, connect and help to change tracks.

The tenth named storm of the annual typhoon season, Linfa developed on July 1 over in the Philippine Sea. It moved erratically westward toward the Philippines, eventually striking the island of Luzon on July 4. Linfa weakened across the island, but reorganized over the South China Sea. It turned northward and strengthened to near typhoon intensity, or winds of 120 km/h (75 mph), but weakened as it curved to the northwest toward southern China. On July 9, the storm made landfall along the Chinese province of Guangdong, dissipating the next day west of Hong Kong. Interacting with the monsoon, Linfa brought heavy rainfall across much of the Philippines for several days, causing flooding and landslides that resulted in traffic accidents and power outages. Across Luzon, Linfa damaged 198 houses and destroyed another seven, causing ₱214.65 million (US$4.76 million) in damage. The storm briefly threatened Taiwan, prompting warnings and restricted ferry travel. Over China, Linfa produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds that wrecked 288 homes. Damage in the country totaled ¥1.74 billion (US$280 million), and there was one death. Meteorological history Toward the end of June, a westerly wind burst moved across the western Pacific Ocean, spawning Typhoon Chan-hom as well as the storm that would become Linfa. On July 1, a large area of convection persisted east of the Philippines, with an associated circulation exposed due to moderate wind shear. At 06:00 UTC that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis over the subsequent 24 hours. However, the system quickly organized, prompting the JTWC to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert later that day, indicating that a storm would likely form imminently. At 18:00 UTC on July 1, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression developed about 500 km (300 mi) east-northeast of the Philippine island of Samar. Early the next day, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 10W, based on the organization of the rainbands about the center. PAGASA – the Philippines' weather agency – also began monitoring the system, giving it the local name Egay. With the subtropical ridge to the northeast, the nascent system moved northwestward initially. Despite persistent shear dislocating the convection, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm at 12:00 UTC on July 2, naming it Linfa. The storm slowly intensified, amplified by good outflow to the south and the presence of warm water temperatures. On July 3, Linfa's track briefly shifted to the southwest, by which time the convective structure had evolved into a central dense overcast. There was uncertainty in the storm's future as it approached the Philippines. This was due to potential interaction with Typhoon Chan-hom to the northeast, and differences in storm models whether an approaching trough would turn Linfa to the east or the west. After turning back to the northwest, the convection around Linfa became even more symmetrical, although the circulation became slightly elongated. At 06:00 UTC on July 4, the storm reached a preliminary peak intensity, with 10 minute sustained winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) according to the JMA. As Linfa neared the northern Philippines, the bulk of the convection was shifted to the southern periphery, due to the continued wind shear. Late on July 4, the center of Linfa made landfall over Palanan, Isabela, on the island of Luzon. Moving westward across the island, the circulation became disorganized as the core convection diminished. By late on July 5, Linfa emerged into the South China Sea. Once over open waters, Linfa began moving to the north-northwest, still moving around the subtropical ridge, and it was expected to move over Taiwan. The circulation remained well- defined but exposed, with the deep convection displaced to the south. With the isolated thunderstorms and unfavorable wind shear, the JTWC noted the potential for the circulation to dissipate over open waters. By July 7, easing wind shear allowed the convection to rebuild and for the structure to improve in organization. By that time, the future of the storm was still uncertain, although a turn to the northwest toward China was expected. Also on July 7, PAGASA issued its final bulletin on the storm as Linfa exited their area of responsibility. More favorable conditions allowed the storm to intensify more on July 8. Around that time, the storm turned more to the northwest due to a ridge exiting China, bringing the storm southwest of western Taiwan. At 00:00 UTC on July 8, the JMA estimated peak 10 minute winds of 95 km/h (60 mph), making it a severe tropical storm. The JTWC assessed further strengthening, upgrading Linfa to typhoon status at 18:00 UTC that day based on a developing well-defined eye. At that time, the agency estimated peak 1 minute winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). Early on July 9, the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) sent a reconnaissance aircraft into the storm, which measured winds of near hurricane-force, as well as gale-force winds 100 km (60 mi) from the center. As the storm approached the southern China coast, the eye expanded to a diameter of 37 km (23 mi), while the thunderstorms on the northern periphery diminished. Around 03:00 UTC on July 9, Linfa made landfall east of Hong Kong near Lufeng, Guangdong, and it quickly weakened once over land. The storm turned westward, inland and parallel to the southern Chinese coastline. As the thunderstorms diminished, the surface sustained winds continued to drop. At 18:00 UTC on July 9, the JTWC issued their final advisory for Linfa, and shortly after the JMA downgraded the storm to a tropical depression. The system turned to the southwest, dissipating over open waters on July 10 off the coast of Guangdong province. Preparations Three simultaneously active typhoons on July 9: (from left to right) Linfa, Chan-hom and Nangka As Linfa (locally known as Egay) approached closer to the Philippine island of Luzon, PAGASA issued Public Storm Warning Signal (PSWS) #2, expecting gale force- winds in Apayao, Aurora, Cagayan, northern Isabela, Kalinga, and Quirino, including the offshore Babuyan and Calayan islands. A lower PSWS was issued for other portions of Luzon. Ahead of the storm, 45,336 people evacuated in the Philippines, utilizing 31 government shelters and assisted by police officers. Restricted travel by boat stranded 1,147 people during the storm's passage. Due to the enhancement of the southwest monsoon by the storm, all ships in the Port of Manila were ordered to remain in harbor, and 20 flights were cancelled in northern Luzon. La Union province declared a state of calamity on July 6 because of the storm. Road-clearing teams were prepared ahead of the storm. The threat of the storm prompted officials in Taiwan to issue sea warnings for the island's southern coast, causing ferry service to two offshore islands to be canceled. A hot air balloon festival was canceled in Taitung City. On July 8, the HKO issued a Standby Signal #1 for Hong Kong due to the increased threat from Linfa. On the next day, the agency upgraded it to a Warning Signal #8, indicating that gale-force winds were expected, although it was dropped in 5.5 hours, becoming one of the shortest-lasting such warning. The local government opened 22 shelters, housing 196 people during the storm. The storm caused the Hong Kong International Airport to close, causing 1,020 flights to be canceled. The China Meteorological Administration also issued 14 warnings for the Chinese mainland, advising residents on the threat of the storm. Schools were closed in Guangdong due to the storm, while train service was canceled and 10,400 boats returned to port. The Chinese government handled the preparations for Linfa at the same time Typhoon Chan-hom was threatening the country's east coast. Impact In its formative stages, Linfa brought light rainfall to Palau and Yap, causing minimal effects. The outskirts of the storm increased winds across eastern Malaysia, which knocked down trees and destroyed the roofs of eight school and several houses. In one of the damaged homes, an 18-month-old baby inside was thrown into a nearby field and suffered injuries. While moving through the Philippines, Linfa caused flooding and four separate landslides. The storm's heavy rainfall caused water levels to rise in reservoirs, prompting officials to drain some excess waters from the Binga Dam in Benguet province. Schools were closed in Metro Manila for three days due to flooding and landslides. The storm damaged 18 sections of roads, as well as two bridges and an irrigation canal in San Gabriel, La Union. Slick roads and a fallen tree caused a bus accident in Quezon City, injuring ten people. Portions of Luzon lost power during the storm, including the entirety of La Union province, and Bacnotan briefly lost water access. In the Ilocos region, a Chinese fishing vessel docked at Currimao port ran aground after being battered by huge waves. Three days of high waves washed 30 tons of mussels ashore Valladolid, Negros Occidental, prompting officials to use trucks to bury the rotting shells to prevent the spread of disease. Rough waves also disrupted rescue efforts for an unrelated ferry disaster in the country that killed 54. The storm interacted with the monsoon to spawn two tornadoes in Negros Occidental, as well as strong winds that knocked down trees and billboards. Across Luzon, Linfa damaged 198 houses and destroyed another seven. The storm damaged ₱34 million (US$753,000) worth of crops, and total damage reached ₱214.65 million (US$4.76 million). Most of the power outages were repaired within a few days of Linfa's passage. After the storm, officials distributed meals to affected residents. Linfa was originally forecast to move northwards and make landfall in Taiwan. However, Linfa curved to the west and hit Southern China instead. Only heavy rains and gusty winds were felt in Southern and Central Taiwan. Moving ashore southern China, Linfa produced wind gusts of 171 km/h (106 mph) in Huilai County, while a station in Lufeng, Guangdong recorded sustained winds of 123 km/h (76 mph). The storm also dropped heavy rainfall in southern China, peaking at in Meizhou. About 370,000 lost power in Shanwei and Shantou. Linfa caused 288 homes to collapse in the country, while 56,000 people were displaced. One person was killed in the country. Damage totaled ¥1.74 billion (US$280 million). Linfa passed about 50 km (30 mi) north of Hong Kong as a weakening storm, producing gusts of around . During its passage, the storm produced a storm surge of along Waglan Island. Rainfall reached around in the territory. The winds remained fairly weak, knocking down a few trees, both in Hong Kong and nearby Macau.

Cooke \\"Warehouse execution systems: the answer for automated DCs?\\" are computerized systems used in warehouses and distribution centers to manage and orchestrate the physical flow of products from receiving through shipping. Warehouses are storage facilities for raw materials and parts used in manufacturing operations; distribution centers (DCs) are facilities that store and distribute finished goods to retail locations, consumers, and other end customers. WES software organizes sequences and directs DC resources - both people and automation systems - necessary to move goods within a warehouse or DC, including: receiving, checking and sorting inbound products for storage (receiving); putaway of received goods into storage; replenishment of picking locations from storage; picking of customer orders; order assembly, checking and packing; loading and shipping. WES works in real time to enable the control of multiple elements of a warehouse process (e.g. inventory, personnel, machines and support services) where changing conditions in one work area or process may require changes in other areas or upstream/downstream processes (reactive). WES is an intermediate step between an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system or warehouse management system WMS and the resources necessary to perform the various warehouse processes. These resources include workers as well as the process control systems used for warehouse automation, often referred to as warehouse control systems or WCS. The WES communicates with inventory and order management systems (such as an ERP or WMS) and the personnel and machinery (including conveyor systems and sorters) that perform the physical tasks involved in the warehouse processes.  Background  WES emerged as a hybrid system that combined specific WMS functionality for picking and other material movement processes with warehouse control system (WCS) functionality for automated warehouseshttps://www.mmh.com/article/big_picture_evolution_of_the_wcs. WCS is the software that controls the conveyor, sortation and other automated material handling systems that move cases, cartons, totes or pallets. In automated warehouses that deploy those types of material handling equipment, WES adds business process logic for planning, optimization and coordination of the work processes or work execution, including work sequencing and release. Many WES systems are tightly integrated with automated systems such as conveyors, sortation, pick-to-light, etc.. More recently, some WES systems have incorporated advanced process modeling and Artificial Intelligence technology that enable real-time adjustments in warehouse processes. As a result, warehouses become more flexible and agile in response.https://www.mmh.com/article/warehouse_execution_software_2.0  Purpose  A WES has the ability to span across multiple areas of warehouse functionality that are traditionally managed by a variety of specialized software systems. WES can be deployed to encompass warehouse management functionality, warehouse control system functionality, material handling equipment (MHE) control, business intelligence and integration with host ERP systems. Encompassing this broad range of functionality is a distinct advantage for WES. As a result, the WES can leverage its visibility of lower level warehouse data to quickly adapt functionality needs for current conditions. This is especially true in facilities with automated systems. The WES can utilize its WCS roots to access connections to advanced picking and sortation systems thus offering an agile approach to optimizing operations in near real-time.  Business intelligence capabilities  Another benefit of leveraging the visibility of lower level data across a broad range of warehouse functionality is the ability to provide unprecedented automated business intelligence. WES' access to and collection of data from various warehouse points can be utilized to provide not only advanced reporting and live dashboard functionality but business intelligence tools such as predictive analysis, prescriptive analysis, and issue detection. The WES can feed data into its business intelligence engine to be mined in near real-time so that DC operations can move beyond just being agile in response to changing conditions, to being proactive in making adjustments before conditions change. WES data can be analyzed to identify trends and predict operational conditions. For example, if operation peaks occur at the end of every month, warehouses can use WES feedback to ramp up staffing and equipment needs more efficiently to reduce overall costs. WES data can also be used to predict issues such as potential stock-outs or order fulfillment delays. Issue detection can also relate to preventative maintenance of warehouse equipment such as lift trucks, conveyor systems, etc. To illustrate this point, through analyzing vast amounts of data, the WES can predict when a conveyor motor may need to be replaced or when a lift truck may need servicing to reduce downtime. By collecting and analyzing data from various lower level warehouse points and taking proactive action, operation leads can use this functionality – which is unique to a WES – to make their facilities more efficient, safe and responsive to increasing customer service requirements.  Arguments against WES terminology  There are a number of voices in the material handling industry that disagree with the creation of a separate term to define WES functionality. \\"The new term being used by material handling software providers, integrators, and pretty much anyone associated with the warehousing industry is Warehouse Execution System (WES). According to a March article in DC Velocity, Warehouse Execution Systems can replace both the WMS and WCS by maintaining warehouse inventory records and driving the mechanization. It certainly seems like a very tasty fry sauce! What's important to remember when exploring options for a Warehouse Execution System is that the functionality is the same functionality that has always been offered! The key to finding the best system for your facility is not a flashy new name offering a combination or best of both worlds mix of solutions, but rather a modularized solution that allows you to define the functionality required.\\"Brian Reinhart \\"Warehouse Execution Systems: A New Label for an Established Solution\\" \\"Why invent a new term? ... there is no such thing as a WES, WCS, or WMS. (There is) simply Warehouse Software functionality needed to suit a business requirement. If the term WES fits fine, but as soon as you draw too many boundaries you create is another layer of interface and support.\\"Jay Morris \\"Commenting on the Roberto Michel article\\"  Counters to the arguments  Right or wrong to create a new term, the term WES is being used in the material handling and distribution industry. The creation of the term arose as a \\"gap\\" was identified in the previous divisions of functionality required to operate a distribution facility. \\"As the demands of omni-channel distribution continue to pressure facilities and supply chains to run more efficiently, many distributors are realizing that the current functionalities of WMS and WCS are insufficient to align, automate, and synchronize the discrete processes needed to optimally control their order-fulfillment needs.\\"Reddwerks \\"Why WMS and WCS Aren't Enough\\" A common occurrence in a large distribution center is that there are multiple varying types of large equipment and work processes provided by multiple vendors. The control of these complex and sometimes intricate functions is provided by the equipment supplier that control software is often called warehouse control system or WCS software. This situation leads to some facilities have multiple WCS software packages running. Without a WES layer this presents a terminology problem: The operation of all the equipment and process functions need to be coordinated and synchronized to provide the required facility objectives. This will require either a \\"Master WCS\\" or the WMS or ERP system to perform the function. A WES is the master WCS. As in a manufacturing execution system (MES), the line between higher level and lower level control is blurred and not well defined, so it is with a WES. Manufacturing operations are significantly more mature than distribution when considering lean practices.Lean manufacturing This is evidenced by the total lack of a Wikipedia article on \\"Lean distribution\\". Manufacturing operations face the same challenges of distribution operations having many different work cells or processes controlled by vendor provided control systems. A special category of software was created for manufacturing to integrate the overall production and coordinate the efforts of all production resources.  E-commerce  One of the byproducts of the rise of e-commerce, is the need for software to support the complexities of omni-channel fulfillment. \\"The omni-channel environment places enormous pressure on DCs to keep up with higher order volumes including rapid processing of small e-commerce orders.\\" The market for WES solutions continue to grow as DC operators seek productivity and support a high throughput. Emerging functionality such as waveless processing is drawing attention to WES. Waveless processing requires constantly taking customer orders from a host system and releasing the work to the warehouse floor efficiently. This is in direct contrast to the typical WMS approach of batching the orders in waves. Waveless processing also allows orders to be worked as received, ensuring a faster turnaround time, and takes advantage of the WES grasp of near real-time information.

The bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.State Historic Preservation Office: Oklahoma Historical Society.Oklahoma's National Register Handbook. April 1, 2015. Accessed July 2, 2015. It was constructed as a Works Progress Administration project. The bridge is significant because of its importance to the transportation history of the area and because it is a WPA-built structure. History Prior to the Great Depression, the economy of Coal County, Oklahoma was already very poor; the county's main product, coal, was no longer in demand by railroads, which had switched to oil-powered trains, and boll weevils had decimated the county's cotton farms.Milligan, James C. \\"Coal County,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, 2009. Accessed March 28, 2015. The railroads abandoned the lines to Coal County since coal was no longer needed. The Great Depression further weakened the county economy. A variety of New Deal projects were completed in Coal County, which provided needed employment and improved the quality of life. Coal County had historically had very poor roads, and the end of railroad transport in Coal County meant that roads were an essential means of transportation. Coal County thus prioritized infrastructure improvements, ranging from road resurfacing to bridge construction. Between 10 and 15 bridges were built in Coal County, including the Keel Creek Bridge. The Keel Creek Bridge was completed in 1940 as a Farm-to-market road project. In 2007, when it was nominated for the National Register of Historic Places, it was still in use, even though many of the WPA bridges in Coal County had been replaced. Architecture The bridge is a concrete slab bridge with a sandstone foundation. Stone was chosen because it would require the greatest number of workers. The poured concrete slab deck was chosen because it met Oklahoma highway department of transportation standards for strength and width. The bridge has three spans with two piers and, the bridge deck is around 18 feet above Keel Creek. The masonry shows that those who worked on the bridge were either skilled stonemasons or had perhaps developed their skills working on previous bridge projects. The stones were cut with sharp edges, which gives the bridge a finer appearance than the other Coal County bridges. The bridge has extruded mortar joints, which is a feature no other Coal County WPA structure has.

Background Slime Season was compiled from archival material in an attempt to circumvent a series of 2015 data leaks which saw hundreds of unreleased Young Thug tracks uploaded to the internet. The material may date back at least one year. The mixtape received a sequel, Slime Season 2, which was released the following month. Slime Season 3 was released in 2016. The title pays homage to Ola Playa, a rapper from Young Thug's YSL Gang who released his own Slime Season mixtape in March 2014. Critical reception Slime Season received positive reviews from critics, with an aggregate score of 80 out of 100 on Metacritic. Under the Gun called it \\"an abstract masterwork\\" and \\"2015's hip-hop answer to jamming sonic psychedelia. Spin stated that \\"this is simply rap’s foremost stylist mouthing off ferociously on all cylinders.\\" HotNewHipHop called it \\"just the game-changer we expected it to be, showcasing an even more confident and experimental Thugger than we heard on Barter 6.\\" Pitchfork called the mixtape \\"an odds-and- ends compilation with no coherent vision,\\" but wrote that \\"Thug remains one of hip-hop's most exciting stylists\\" and pointed out the tracks \\"Freaky,\\" \\"Draw Down,\\" and \\"Wood Would\\" as highlights.

Background Hank Williams recorded \\"(Last Night) I Heard You Crying in Your Sleep\\" at his first MGM recording session after releasing a few sides with Sterling Records. Despite its bouncy tempo, the song contains somber lyrics about a heartbroken man who has come to realize that the woman he loves has never loved him. Making the song even sadder is the forgiving tone of the narrator (\\"I know you tried your best to love me,\\" \\"I love you so much I want you happy\\"), and its simple language is as good an illustration as any of the profound simplicity of Williams' love songs. An embryonic version of the song exists as a lyric sheet in the Alabama Department of Archives and History with words quite dissimilar to the finished recording, suggesting that songwriting wasn't quite the spontaneous act that Williams later made it out to be in interviews; in 1952 he declared to Pathfinder, \\"People don't write music. It's given to you; you sit there and wait and it comes to you. If a song takes longer than thirty minutes or an hour, I usually throw it away. Williams recorded the song on April 21, 1947 at Castle Studio in Nashville with Fred Rose producing the session. Williams recorded the song during his first session with MGM on April 21, 1947.

In September 1912, Serb majors M. Vasić and Vasilije Trbić, a Chetnik commander operating from Porečje region, gathered 30 Chetniks and travelled to the village of Desovo where they shot 111 Albanian men and razed the village. Desovo was once again razed in 1929 by Serb Chetnik bands active in the region. The event led to the first wave of migrations of Desovo Albanians mainly to Turkey, with some others going abroad to the United States and Australia. In 1948 Desovo numbered around 1,500 inhabitants mostly Albanians. Due to the sociopolitical pressures experienced within post war communist Yugoslavia under Aleksandar Ranković, between 1963–1968 most of the remaining Albanians in Desovo migrated to Turkey. In the 21st century, the village population is made up of Macedonians, Bosniaks and national Albanian sentiments among remaining Albanians have somewhat dissipated with assimilation being an issue.

Yad Levi Eshkol was registered in 1970 and operates as a non-governmental organization. Yad Levi Eshkol was headed by Mrs. Miriam Eshkol from 1970 to 2008, when she was named Honorary President. Founding members of Yad Levi Eshkol include: Assaf Agin, Avraham Agmon, Ephraim Ben- Artzi, David Kalderon, Ami Kamir, Moshe Sanbar, Shmuel Shilo, Simcha Soroker, Aharon Uzan, Aviad Yafeh and Gershon Zak. Past members of the executive board included Michael Arnon, Shraga Biran and Arie Eliav. Programs and activities Archive and research In its initial goals set by the government in 1970, Yad Levi Eshkol was tasked with organization of Levi Eshkol's archive. His personal archive, containing documents dating from World War I era and until the Prime Minister's passing, is held at Yad Levi Eshkol. Digitization of the archives commenced in 2014, alongside attempts to expand its findings by launching an oral history project for gathering testimonials of Levi Eshkol's acquaintances. Later additions, in 2017, included a photo and film archive and an artifacts collection. Yad Levi Eshkol sponsors grants to promote academic research and publications. Levi Eshkol House In 1977, Yad Levi Eshkol was named custodian of the former residence of Israel's prime ministers and tasked with the establishment of an institute commemorating Levi Eshkol. Eshkol lived in the residence on two occasions, as Minister of Finance (1954–1955) and as Prime Minister (1963–1969). It wasn't until two decades later that Yad Levi Eshkol was able to raise funds and make restoration work on the building, which eventually stopped in 2003 due to insufficient funding. Restoration recommenced in 2014 and the building was opened to the public in 2016, dedicated in remembrance of Levi Eshkol.Levi Eshkol Museum opens in Jerusalem Educational activity Since 2014, Yad Levi Eshkol promotes educational initiatives, performed on an ongoing basis across Israel and concerning up-to-date views on Levi Eshkol's actions and their relevant outcomes—surrounding the Six-Day War, the effects of his work in Mekorot water company, outcomes of the immigrant absorption policy in the Jewish Agency, and various social and economic matters shaped by Eshkol's public roles. Other activities include the annual memorial service held at the grave plot on Mt. Herzl.

It contains a mural, Women Making Pishafa, painted by artist Acee Blue Eagle (Muscogee, ca. 1907–1959). The post office is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.State Historic Preservation Office: Oklahoma Historical Society.Oklahoma's National Register Handbook. April 1, 2015. Accessed July 2, 2015. History Coalgate's plans to build new post office were approved by the federal government in 1937.Clark, Orville Verdell. \\"Coalgate,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, Oklahoma Historical Society, Accessed July 2, 2015. A New Deal program, the Treasury Department's Section of Painting and Sculpture, required that a portion of the money designated for the construction of federal buildings be used to pay for artists to decorate them. The post office was completed in 1940. The federal government commissioned Muscogee Creek artist Acee Blue Eagle to paint a mural, which he completed in 1942.McLerran, Jennifer. A New Deal for Native Art: Indian Arts and Federal Policy, 1933-1943, University of Arizona Press: Tucson, Arizona, 2009. p. 266. The post office is one of only three in Oklahoma to have a mural painted directly onto its plaster wall. Blue Eagle was a significant Native American painter who founded the art program at Bacone College and helped create the Bacone school of Flatstyle painting. The post office is significant because it is representative of historic New Deal politics, government, and art, and the post office and mural together show how a local New Deal project was realized. The post office was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Architecture The post office's supervising architect was Louis A. Simon. The building is in the Art Moderne style with a flat roof and an asymmetrical front. While the entrance to the building is centered, the four large windows around it are not, with two to the left, one to the right, one above the entrance, and an additional smaller window on the far right side of the building. The name of the building is off-center and is instead centered over the four large windows. The building's exterior is in buff- colored brick with occasional darker orange-shaded bricks. The entrance to the I-shaped lobby is through a wood-and-glass-enclosed vestibule, with service bays on the wall opposite the entrance. Women Making Pishafa The mural is located above the door to the postmaster's office. Blue Eagle used distemper and acrylics to paint the mural. The painting is an example of the style known as Bacone school, a form of Flatstyle painting, popular among Native artists in the early to mid-20th century. Painted directly onto the plaster wall of the building, Women Making Pishafa depicts people preparing pashofa, a flint corn soup that is made by Muscogee Creeks and other Southeastern tribes. A woman on the right side of the painting pounds corn into cornmeal. In the center, two women separate the corn husk from the corn pulp. A table behind them is set with bowls and a coffee pot, which shows that pashofa can be a soup or a beverage. While the women work, a boy plays with a toy horse, and a man on the left side of the painting shoots an arrow at a flock of birds overhead. During 1964 renovations to the post office interior, dust and dirt damaged the painting.Fred Beaver (Seminole/Muscogee, 1911–1980 , restored the mural.

Sellheim fought in the Second Boer War with Chauvel's Mounted Infantry and fought in the Battle of Modder River. For his actions during the war, Sellheim became a Companion of the Order of the Bath. After serving in a variety of staff positions, he became Quartermaster general of the Australian Military Forces in 1912 and two years later was Adjutant general. Between 1914 and 1916 he oversaw the Australian Imperial Force base at Cairo. He became the Adjutant general again. After the end of the First World War, Sellheim became Quartermaster general in 1920 but resigned in 1927 to become Administrator of Norfolk Island, where he died on heart failure in 1928. Early life Sellheim was born on 4 May 1866 in Balmain, New South Wales, the eldest son of Philip Frederic Sellheim and his wife Laura Morriset. He was educated at the Brisbane Grammar School and was a surveyor afterwards. Sellheim married Susan Howell-Griffith on 7 December 1890. He enlisted in the Kennedy Regiment, where he received a second lieutenant's commission in 1892 and was promoted to captain the next year. As the regimental adjutant, he obtained a permanent commission in the Queensland Defence Force in 1896. After attending courses in the United Kingdom, Sellheim served in the Second Boer War as an officer attached to British units and the chief of staff of Harry Chauvel's Mounted Infantry, taking part in the Battle of Belmont and the Battle of Modder River. He later joined the Queensland Mounted Infantry during the advance on Pretoria. For his services during the war, Sellheim was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath and also Mentioned in Despatches. After the Boer War, Sellheim was shifted through various staff appointments and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in December 1909 and appointed the Quartermaster General to the Australian Military Forces in 1912. Promoted to colonel in 1913, he became the Adjutant-General in August 1914. First World War Sellheim served as the head of the administrative staff in the 1st Division of the Australian Imperial Force. He did not have a good relationship with his superior, Major General William Bridges and as a result Bridges did not deal directly with Sellheim on administrative matters. Sellheim organised a base for the AIF in Cairo and was promoted to brigadier general in 1916. AIF Administrative Headquarters was moved to England in May. Sellheim was replaced by Robert Anderson in August and was sent back to Australia to become the Adjutant General again. He was again mentioned in despatches and also appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. Later life Promoted to major general in January 1920, Sellheim became the Quartermaster General as well as the Adjutant General as a result of decreasing defence expenditures due to the end of the First World War. He resigned his positions in January 1927 to become the administrator of Norfolk Island, but died of heart failure on 25 January 1928, and was buried in the cemetery Kingston, Norfolk Island. Sellheim's maternal grandfather, James Morisset, had served as commandant of Norfolk from 1829 to 1834.

Current status  Suzanne Marie Collins Tennessee has carried out thirteen executions since the reinstatement of the death penalty: one in 2000 under governor Don Sundquist, five from 2006 to 2009 under governor Phil Bredesen, three during the final months of Bill Haslam’s second term, including Edmund Zagorski, and four so far under Bill Lee. The first execution during Bredesen's governorship was that of Sedley Alley, sentenced to death for the rape, torture and murder of 19-year old U.S. Marine Corps Lance Corporal Suzanne Marie Collins. Her parents were notable advocates of expediting the death penalty appeal process.Douglas, John E. (1997). Journey Into Darkness. New York: Lisa Drew Book/Schribner. pp. 268-270. . , 53 condemned prisoners are incarcerated on the state's death row. The Tennessee Supreme Court sets execution dates. The Governor alone decides whether to grant or deny clemency; the Tennessee Board of Probation and Parole makes a recommendation in each case but the Governor is not required to follow the Board's recommendation. Executions take place at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville at 7pm (the time was 1am until 2009 and 10am from 2009-2018). In 2007, Tennessee established by legislation a Committee to Study the Administration of the Death Penalty. After 16 months of analysis and hearings, the study committee on the death penalty suggested reform of the death penalty without abolishing it, including the creation of an independent authority to review death sentences. Of the two women sentenced to death, Gaile Owens was pardoned in July 2010, owing to a sentence deemed \\"disproportionate\\" (she was convicted in 1986 for having killed her husband who beat her). The second woman, Christa Pike, who was convicted in 1996 for having tortured to death a fellow Job Corps dormitory resident, remains on death row.  Early history  In Tennessee, hanging was a legal method of execution until 1913, when executions were suspended for two years. In 1915, the electric chair was introduced and used for 45 years. Between 1960 and 2000, the death penalty however was not applied in this state. The death penalty was reinstated there in 1975, but executions did not resume until 2000, with the lethal injection that had become a legal method of execution at the end of this period. However, those sentenced to death before January 1, 1999 can request to be executed in the electric chair; moreover, faced with difficulties in acquiring the drugs needed for lethal injections, Tennessee law was amended to once more permit electrocution as a backup method, in case of any problems with acquiring the drugs needed for lethal injections. On November 16, 2018, as executions had resumed earlier that year after a nearly decade hiatus, the Tennessee Supreme Court has set six executions dates between May 2019 and April 2020.Tennessee Supreme Court Sets Six Execution Dates for 2019 and 2020, DPIC. Retrieved 21 November 2018. Should these executions be carried out, neither be rescheduled nor stayed, it would lead Tennessee to execute as many inmates in one year than it did in almost ten years before hiatus.

Since that time, the club grew to involve 700 players and 60 coaches with teams from the youngest age groups up to an adult amateur side. Gartcairn decided to apply for membership of the Scottish Junior Football Association in 2015, to create an unbroken player pathway to semi-professional level and to provide a playing option for existing local talent in Airdrie and neighbouring Coatbridge. Airdrie had previously had no representation at Junior level since the 1930s. The Academy officially opened their own facility at St Margaret's High School in Airdrie in January 2014, however the Junior side initially had to play out of Coatbridge Outdoor Sports Centre due to certain ground criteria not being met. The club were able to use to their own ground, named MTC Park, from January 2016 after alterations were made. The first team have been managed since the winter of 2019 by William Kinniburgh.

It is a biography of French \\"soldier, spy, master mariner, explorer, cartographer, artist and \\"Father of New France\\"\\", Samuel de Champlain. In this book, Fischer examines more closely Champlain's personal impact on the establishment of a French colony in the New World - securing royal support despite opposition from formidable foes like Marie de Medici and Cardinal Richelieu, negotiating with \\"Indian nations\\" and imbuing the new colony with the values of humanism. He is also remembered for having survived 27 crossings of the North Atlantic in 37 years - without ever losing a ship. Despite never being the \\"senior official\\" of New France, Champlain functioned as an absolute ruler and as Fischer shows, his vision for New France (a vision that was very much a product of Champlain's upbringing and experiences) helps explain both its triumphs and failures. Fischer has substantial experience using the life and perspective of a great leader to tell a broader historical narrative; he employed a similar structure in Washington's Crossing for which he received a Pulitzer Prize in 2005.  Main thesis  Samuel de Champlain arrive à Québec - George Agnew Reid - 1909 Champlain's dreams as an explorer and cartographer are documented in his own writings - one of them was to find a North American passage to China.Fischer 2008, p 7 Ostensibly, his overarching dream was to establish a successful French colony in the New World. This required Champlain to: * secure political support in the French courtFischer 2008, p 345 Between 1535 and 1601, six French settlements in the New World ended in failure.Fischer 2008, p 113 Champlain carefully studied the experiences of earlier explorers like Jacques Cartier and Pierre de Chauvin. But then, he needed to convince men like the duc de Sully, the King's Chief Minister who thought American colonies were against French national interest as they distracted from business at home.Fischer 2008, p 119 Other noblemen of the time would have preferred domestic reforms to expansion abroad and Champlain stayed alert to their machinations. * and make difficult administrative decisions once in the New World Even after royal support could be secured, \\"rival merchants, competing seaports and the representatives of foreign powers\\" conspired against the colonies of 'New France' and it fell to Champlain to lead his men to deal with all kinds of problems. The explorers had to claim land, protect it from the \\"Indian nations\\" and convince French subjects to emigrate to the New World – a prospect they were much less enthusiastic about than Britishers fleeing religious persecution.Fischer 2008, p 445 Even after all of this was done and the colonies began to run smoothly, he had to regulate unlicensed trade on the rivers and build trading posts to make sure the colony stayed profitable.Fischer 2008, p 455 But as Fischer puts forward in this book, Champlain's dream went further than that. He envisioned that this colony would be \\"a place where people of different cultures could live together in amity and concord\\" and hoped that North America could be this place. He dreamed of collective action, humanistic ideals like peace and tolerance and a Francophone legacy in the new world. Fischer makes frequent reference to Champlain's \\"grand design\\" or his sweeping vision. What Fischer seeks to do in this book, after articulating this aspiration, is ask a series of questions about why this man believed in it and what steps he took to make it a reality.  Fischer's treatment of Champlain  Fischer rejects the view that Champlain was just another European mercenary looking to seize lands and enslave native populations like many other early British and Spanish explorers in North America. He writes admiringly of Champlain's humanist values - that he treated \\"Indian nations\\" with respect and pursued peaceful coexistence through policies of \\"trade alliances, cultural tolerance and intermarriage\\".  An explanation for Champlain's humanism  * Growing up in port city of Brouage Fischer describes the unique character of Brouage, the town of Champlain's youth as the \\"salty broth in which our hero was cooked\\".Fischer 2008, p 15 Due to its thriving economy and \\"cosmopolitan nature\\", the man historians know as Champlain's father managed to work his way up from a humble ship's pilot to a naval captain in the King's Marine. Thus, Champlain's early life was one of visible opportunity and upwards mobility, an experience that Fischer claims Champlain's later optimism and persistence is a result of. Brouage was in a region that was deeply suspicious of Paris, the seat of power but enjoyed a \\"broad diversity of language, culture, religion and ecology\\".Fischer 2008, p 37 This upbringing inculcated in Champlain an exceptional curiosity about cultural differences. He learned Dutch, English and Spanish in school and from his neighbors and \\"the art of navigation\\" from his father.Fischer 2008, p 26 Despite not having a 'classical' education, Samuel de Champlain became skilled in the use of weapons and likely learned map-making from a Champlain family friend who was an \\"engineer and geographer to the King\\".Fischer 2008, p 25 Fischer emphasizes the exposure Champlain had as a youth and the different strengths he picked up through his family, his education and his town to show that each served him well in the adventures that would come later on. * The religious turbulence of his youth Even the small town of Brouage was not immune from the clashes between Calvinists and Roman Catholics that occurred after the Protestant Reformation. Fischer writes about an incident in which a rival port city sent \\"barges full of sand and rock\\" to block the channel leading to Brouage and sabotage its trade.Fischer 2008, p 20 After 1628, Brouage was even turned into a garrison by Cardinal Richelieu, its sea trade having been cut off. Even though historians cannot confirm whether Champlain was a Protestant or a Catholic, his writings show the influence of a deep \\"Christian faith\\".Fischer 2008, p 23 Fischer goes further, drawing parallels between King Henry IV of France and Champlain, arguing that both men detested intolerance and believed it to be \\"anti- Christian\\".Fischer 2008, p 57 He claims that both thought religion was a force for social and political stability, faith was an intensely personal choice and religious controversy mattered far less than \\"piety, humility and good works\\". Fischer claims that Champlain gained an understanding of the need for cultural acceptance, but also limited violence to ensure stability from war. That Champlain may have been the illegitimate son of the King One of the new theories published in this book is that Champlain was actually the son of French King, Henry IV.Fischer 2008, p 45 Historians such as Marcel Trudel and Hubert Deschamps have previously expressed belief that Champlain was actually the son of an \\"unknown French nobleman\\".Fischer 2008, p 43 Fischer, however, said that both Champlain's \\"close relationship with the King\\" and \\"the King’s travel history in the nine months prior to Champlain’s birth\\" lead him to believe that Henry IV was in fact the father. At a book reception in Brandeis, Fischer stated that, “He was at the right place at the right time, so to speak. It could have happened. Granted that there is exactly zero hard evidence to support that theory, but [if Henry IV were his father] it would explain many anomalies in their relationship. It’s only a possibility, but it’s very clear that the two of them had a very special relationship.”  The challenges of writing biography on Samuel de Champlain  The defeat of the Iroquois at Lake Champlain Many reviewers of Fischer's work pointed out that little is known about Samuel de Champlain- both in the United States and also in Canada. Despite the variety of his achievements, he is a somewhat obscure figure. There is only a single “authentic likeness . . . is known to survive from his own time”. This likeness is a one-inch engraving wielding an advanced wheel-lock arquebus and with a panache, or a feathery plume in his helmet.Fischer 2008, p 3 Every other portrait or image came much later. Another is that he wrote \\"thousands of pages about what he did, but only a few words about who he was\\" - historians hardly know his birthdate, level of schooling or even whether he was baptized as a Protestant or a Catholic.Fischer 2008, p 4 Fischer has also offered the view that Champlain may have been forgotten due to the predominance of the Annales school of French historiography. Under its influence, the \\"structure of society and the details of daily and communal life\\" were seen as more important subjects for history than great men or major events. In response to the many questions left unanswered, Fischer devotes a series of Appendices that examine competing theories on subjects from his birthdate to the questions of authorship or authenticity in his surviving writings.Fischer 2008, p 569-635  Fischer's views on biography  In the Introduction to this book, Fischer mentions the need for biography to walk the line between hagiography and iconoclasm.Fischer 2008, p 10 In an address to the New York Historical Society, Fischer lays out the three rules of biography he picked up from historians Francis Parkman and Samuel Eliot Morison: # \\"Go there\\" # \\"Do it\\" # \\"Then write it\\" Partly in deference to this process, the Introduction to the book is subtitled In Search of Champlain and Fischer makes frequent mention of the role of \\"physical evidence\\" in knowing history.Fischer 2008, p 1  Reception  Tony Horwitz, writing for The Washington Post, described Champlain's Dream as \\"exhaustively researched\\" though perhaps too effusive in its praise for Champlain's character. He writes that Champlain seems “almost perfect, and perfectly dull” and though Fischer tries, Champlain remains an abstract figure and doesn't come alive. Moreover, Horwitz describes the near avoidance of Champlain's love life or trust placed in Champlain's own writings of how the Native Americans loved him as odd notes. He adds that the absence of a dramatic event to offer a tight focus (like in Fischer's other books, Washington's Crossing and Paul Revere's Ride) throws off the book's pace. Max Boot, in The New York Times, takes the view that this work must be considered within the view of how little documentation exists of Champlain's life and how he \\"remains a relatively obscure corner of our continent’s history\\". Since Fischer's \\"plain, unadorned\\" prose is seeded with \\"intriguing ideas\\", the reader's interest is caught by how this man they barely knew anything about was so versatile and accomplished and how smoothly Fischer's narrative of his life fits its big ideas together. In general, the response was positive, with Champlain's Dream being declared one of the best books of 2008 by the New York Times (100 Notable Books) and Publishers Weekly (Best Books of the Year) as well as a number of regional papers.http://list.uvm.edu/cgi- bin/wa?A3=ind0903&L;=CRVNET&E;=base64&P;=2775981&B;=--------------060704000800050107030504&T;=application%2Fmsword;%20name=%22Champlain's%20Dream- Reviews.doc%22&N;=Champlain's%20Dream-Reviews.doc.

The Bank is headquartered in McLean, Virginia and serves trade associations, think tanks, government affairs firms, political committees, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and individuals across the country. Bloomberg Magazine once called it \\"The Most Important Bank in America.\\" In 2015, Bloomberg Businessweek headlined a story \\"Where Candidates Stash Their Cash\\" describing its dominance in banking Republican presidential campaigns and allied committees. The bank maintains higher than average asset quality and liquidity. History Chain Bridge was founded, de novo, in 2007 by Peter Fitzgerald, who previously served in the United States Senate as an Illinois Republican. Fitzgerald is the son of Gerald F. Fitzgerald, who was chairman of Chicago's Suburban Bancorp which was sold to Bank of Montreal in 1994 for $246 million. Gerald Fitzgerald had a policy of lending out no more than half his banks' deposits (according to the FDIC, the national average for banks is 81%). \\"My father couldn't sleep at night if he did not have 50% liquid assets at any one time,\\" Peter Fitzgerald told Chicago Business after Gerald Fitzgerald's death in 2010. The extended Fitzgerald family has owned, co-owned, or managed around 57 commercial banks since the 1940s. Shortly after opening, Chain Bridge Bank cancelled a bricks and mortar branching strategy and instead concentrated on implementing emerging technologies, such as remote deposit capture, in order to bank clients all across the country. Chain Bridge Bank began attracting large-scale political, non-profit and commercial deposits during the 2008 financial crisis because it had no bad assets and did not rely on borrowing to fund its operations. \\"We're drowning in liquidity because people are pulling money out from other places and depositing it with us,\\" Fitzgerald told the Washington Post in September 2008. The Bank invests most of its deposits in reserves at the Fed or other high quality, liquid assets. \\"Knowing that campaigns might need to take money out at any time, we more less have to keep the deposits in cash,\\" according to Fitzgerald. The bank opened a mortgage division in 2012 that does customized lending and focuses on jumbo loans. Chain Bridge Bank specializes in treasury management, speedy deposit account opening, credit card issuance, and client support for trade associations, political campaigns and other large enterprises. It keeps its wire service open until 5 p.m., more than two hours later than most banks. All bankers are required to keep their cell phone numbers on their business cards. \\"We are 24/7,\\" Fitzgerald told the Financial Times in 2012. \\"We're a very high-touch bank, as opposed to the mass retail banks, which I think the political people need and desire. They call weekends and nights – they need to wire things out. If someone calls us at 4:45, we can still do that wire. If you call a mass retail bank, they will probably tell you their wire room closed at 2:30.\\" The bank is also credited by election lawyers with familiarity with Federal Election Committee regulation.

Early life and education Moyra Aloysius Barry was born in 1886 in Dublin, the eldest of eleven children of Bernard and Jane Barry. Her father worked as a merchant. Although she was named Moyra, she was always known as Mary to her family. Barry attended Loreto Convent, North Great George's St., going on to the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA) Schools from 1908 to 1909. Whilst studying with the RHA she won a number of prizes for composition and drawing, later moving to London to attend the Slade School of Fine Art from 1911 to 1914, being awarded first prize for painting from the cast 1913 to 1914. She lived and tutored English privately in Quito, Ecuador in the 1920s, before returning to the family home in Rathmines, Dublin in the 1930s. Artistic career From 1908 to 1952 Barry was frequently exhibited by the RHA, holding a number of individual shows at the Angus Gallery from 1932 onwards. She was noted for her portraits and landscapes, but was gained a reputation of her painting of flowers. For these flower paintings, Barry worked in watercolours and oils, often depicting chrysanthemums and rhododendrons, drawing inspiration from the waterlillies in the National Botanic Gardens. Dermod O'Brien described Barry as \\"the finest painter of flowers alive\\" in 1941, having visited an exhibition at the Victor Waddington Galleries, Dublin. Barry was a member of the Society of Dublin Painters, being one of the most prominent and leading members in the 1930s and 1940s. She was a member of the Dublin Sketching Club, exhibiting with them regularly in the 1930s. She was occasionally exhibited by the Watercolour Society of Ireland, contributing to group exhibitions in England, the Netherlands, and North America. Legacy Barry's work is held in a number of Irish institutions, such as the Crawford Art Gallery, the Ulster Museum, and her Self portrait in the artist's studio (1920) is hung in the National Gallery of Ireland. Barry died in Dublin on 2 February 1960. She is buried at Glasnevin Cemetery.

A grassroots all- volunteer organization, Aytzim is active in the United States, Canada and Israel. The organization is a former member of the American Zionist Movement and has worked in partnership with Ameinu, the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life (COEJL), Hazon, Interfaith Moral Action on Climate, Interfaith Oceans, GreenFaith, Mercaz/Masorti (Conservative Judaism), the National Religious Coalition on Creation Care, and the Jewish National Fund (JNF) — although Aytzim has long criticized JNF for not prioritizing sustainability and environmental justice in its actions. Aytzim's work at the nexus of Judaism, environmentalism and Zionism has courted controversy from both Jewish and non-Jewish groups (see below section on criticism). Projects Aytzim has five projects: * EcoJews of the Bay: EcoJews holds Jewish-environmental events in the San Francisco Bay Area. * Green Zionist Alliance: The Grassroots Campaign for a Sustainable Israel (The organization's former name is now used as a project name.) The Green Zionist Alliance works on issues related to the environment of Israel and the Middle East. * Jewcology: Home of the Jewish Environmental Movement: Jewcology.org is an online resource for information on Jewish environmentalism, and includes resources such as a job board and an interactive map of Jewish environmental initiatives. * Jews of the Earth: Jews of the Earth organizes Jews locally and nationally for environmental action. * Shomrei Breishit: Rabbis and Cantors for the Earth: An environmental-advocacy group that Aytzim runs in partnership with GreenFaith, Shomrei Breishit includes more than 100 Jewish clergy, including chief rabbis. Aytzim also runs an internship program; hosts an English-language compilation of educational materials, research papers, academic papers, news articles, videos and books about Israel's environment; has student chapters, including \\"Yovel: Aytzim at NYU\\"; and runs occasional conferences and weekend retreats. Criticism Aytzim has been criticized (predominately by the conservative Hudson Institute historian Arthur Herman) for its stance against hydrofracking, with Herman labeling the GZA in the New York Post as \\"running against the tide of technology\\". The organization also has been criticized for its support of environmentalism and tikkun olam. Others have been critical of Aytzim's stance against BDS; for greenwashing Israel; for participating in the People's Climate March; for associating with Israel and Zionism; for working with Jewish National Fund; and for its participation in a process that largely favors Israel's political status quo. Some individuals have criticized the GZA for its promotion of community gardens, charging that making community gardens more widely available is patronizing to the public. Others see Zionism's mission as finished with the establishment of the modern state of Israel and they question the relevance of the entire system of legacy Zionist organizations formed by the World Zionist Organization and its constituent agencies. History In response to perceived negligence in environmentally stewarding the land of Israel, as philosopher Martin Buber first observed, the Green Zionist Alliance (GZA) was founded in 2001 by Alon Tal, Eilon Schwartz and Rabbi Michael Cohen, with a large team of other volunteers, including Adam Werbach, Devra Davis and current Aytzim leadership — although its Jews of the Earth project originally was founded by Daniel Ziskin as an independent nonprofit in 1999 and merged into Aytzim in 2019. In 2002 the GZA became the first environmental party at the World Zionist Congress, where it has had elected representation since and until the start of the 38th Congress. Through this process, the organization succeeded in the appointment of environmental leaders, including Tal and Schwartz, to the board of the Keren Kayemet L'Yisrael (KKL / Jewish National Fund in Israel). For more than a dozen years, Aytzim representation had included Tal and Orr Karassin. In 2006 the GZA incorporated as a 501(c)3 nonprofit. In late September 2014, the GZA acquired Jewcology.org from fellow Jewish-environmental group Canfei Nesharim and, in partnership with GreenFaith, launched a Jewish-clergical environmental advocacy group called Shomrei Breishit: Rabbis and Cantors for the Earth. To better reflect the scope of the organization's work, the GZA rebranded itself as Aytzim, keeping the Green Zionist Alliance name both legally and for its Israel-focused work. Aytzim has had many prominent Jewish leaders serve on its Green Zionist Alliance slates for the World Zionist Congress, including Rabbi Ellen Bernstein, Mirele Goldsmith, Susannah Heschel, Nigel Savage, Rabbi Fred Scherlinder Dobb, Richard Schwartz, Rabbi Marc Soloway, Rabbi Lawrence Troster, Rabbi Arthur Waskow and Laurie Zoloth. The Aytzim advisory board includes former Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Naomi Tsur and Daniel Orenstein, a faculty member at the Technion Israel Institute of Technology and the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies. Activities Since its founding as the Green Zionist Alliance, Aytzim has been a factor in the greening of Israeli policy — both internally and in its interactions with other countries — although that greening has led to charges of greenwashing, as discussed above. Still, as an all-volunteer organization, Aytzim's accomplishments include quadrupling funding for afforestation; building new bicycle lanes in Israel; developing an environmental program for villagers in Rwanda; saving the unique ecosystem of the Samar sand dunes in the Arava Valley from destruction; and helping Israel transition from incandescent to energy-efficient lighting. Aytzim has worked to green the activities of quasi-governmental organizations, such as legacy Zionist organizations Jewish National Fund and the Jewish Agency, including the installation of rooftop energy-generating solar panels and indoor energy-efficient lighting; the planned transition of vehicles in their fleets to high fuel-efficiency and alternative-fuel models; the development of seven-year environmental plans, inspired by the shmita sabbatical cycle, to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in Israel; the inclusion of environmental education for new immigrants to Israel; the development of community gardens at immigrant-housing centers; and increased support for in- country carbon-mitigating projects and local organic agriculture. Aytzim also has been active in addressing energy issues in Israel, including a successful effort to stop hydrofracking of oil shale in Israel's Elah Valley, and to ban all fossil-fuel extraction on land owned by Jewish National Fund in Israel, as well as a successful effort to increase the public share of profits from Israel's offshore natural-gas fields. Working with partners, Aytzim has been engaged in campaigns to both protect and educate about the environment, including publication of the Jewish Energy Guide, a 50-article book on energy issues from a Jewish perspective produced in partnership with the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life; development of an Ethic of the Seas in partnership with the National Religious Coalition on Creation Care; filing an amicus brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in the “Our Children’s Trust” case; support for the Green New Deal and a green stimulus to support the economy in the wake of the 2019-2020 coronavirus crisis; support for the Black Lives Matter movement; support for Earth Day, youth climate strikes and the Global Climate Strike; support for a cross-country Jewish environmental-education campaign led by Hazon; support for finalization of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants; support for inclusion of greenhouse gases in consideration of the Endangered Species Act; endorsing a Jewish community-wide transition from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy; supporting efforts to combat anti-Semitism; and an effort to support Israel's forests in the wake of the worst forest fire in the country's history. Additionally, Aytzim has been active in working with partners to hold events, such as the \\"Forward on Climate\\" initiative (with 160 other groups, including primary organizers the Sierra Club, 350.org and the Hip Hop Caucus); the Food & Water Watch-organized New Yorkers Against Fracking coalition (with musician Natalie Merchant, actor Mark Ruffalo and more than 200 other groups – including MoveOn, Friends of the Earth and the Indigenous Environmental Network); the People's Climate March in both 2014 (New York) and 2017 (Washington) (with hundreds of other groups); the March for a Clean Energy Revolution in Philadelphia (with hundreds of other groups); and the Sacred Earth project (with a dozen other faith-based environmental organizations – including Franciscan Action Network and GreenFaith). Some of Aytzim's efforts with partners were initially successful but ultimately failed, such as its partnership with 14 other Jewish organizations – including Hazon, COEJL and the Religious Action Center – in founding the Green Hevra, a now-dormant network of Jewish-environmental organizations, and an effort to develop a now- dormant network of individuals, organizations and communities working to create a healthier and more sustainable world rooted in the values of the shmita cycle. Other efforts by Aytzim have been unsuccessful, including its attempt to prevent further demolition of the Bedouin village of Al Arakib in Israel's Negev region; its opposition to Israel's \\"Nation-State Bill\\"; its opposition to cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) proposed in the U.S. Farm Bill; an effort to green the General Assembly of the Jewish Federations of North America; and an effort to protect labor unions in the Janus v.

Career Chicago Cubs Jiménez was considered the top international free agent for 2013. MLB.com called him as a five-tool player, noting that during workouts he impressed scouts with his intelligence, speed, and gap-to-gap power. He signed with the Chicago Cubs in July 2013 for a $2.8 million signing bonus. Jiménez made his professional debut in 2014 with the Arizona League Cubs, where he was limited to just 164 plate appearances due to a shoulder injury. When healthy, he reached base at a disappointing .268 clip. Still, scouts remained optimistic due to his young age and physical ability. Jiménez received a promotion to short-season single-A to start 2015 with the Eugene Emeralds. There, Jiménez fared considerably better, improving his on- base percentage to .328, and slugging seven home runs in 250 plate appearances. Jiménez began the 2016 season with the low-A South Bend Cubs. Jiménez spent all of 2016 with South Bend, hitting .329 with 14 home runs and 81 RBIs in 112 games. After the season, the Cubs assigned Jiménez to the Mesa Solar Sox of the Arizona Fall League. Jiménez began the 2017 season with the Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League. Chicago White Sox On July 13, 2017, the Cubs traded Jiménez, Dylan Cease, Matt Rose, and Bryant Flete to the Chicago White Sox for José Quintana. The White Sox assigned him to the Winston-Salem Dash of the Carolina League, and later promoted him to the Birmingham Barons of the Class AA Southern League. In 89 total games between Myrtle Beach, Winston-Salem and Birmingham, he batted .312 with 19 home runs, 65 RBIs, and a .947 OPS. The White Sox added Jiménez to their 40-man roster after the 2017 season. In 2018, the White Sox assigned Jiménez to the Birmingham Barons of the Class AA Southern League, though he missed the end of spring training with a knee injury and the beginning of the regular season with a pectoral injury. The White Sox promoted him to the Charlotte Knights of the Class AAA International League in June. In 108 total games between the two teams, he slashed .337/.384/.577 with 22 home runs and 75 RBIs. On March 22, 2019 Jimenez signed a six-year $43 million contract with Chicago White Sox. The deal included two additional option years for the team which could bring the total value to $75 million. It was the richest contract ever for a player with no service time before his major-league debut. Jiménez was promoted to the White Sox 25-man roster for the 2019 season. He was placed on the injured list on April 29 with an ankle injury. On defense in 2019, he had a -11 Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) rating, the lowest in the major leagues among left fielders. He ended the season with 31 home runs and 79 RBI in 122 games. Eloy placed 4th in Rookie of the Year voting. Overall with the 2020 Chicago White Sox, Jiménez batted .296 with fourteen home runs and 41 RBIs in 55 games.https://www.mlb.com/player/eloy-jimenez-650391?stats=career-r- hitting-mlb&year;=2020 References External links * 1996 births All-Star Futures Game players Arizona League Cubs players Birmingham Barons players Charlotte Knights players Chicago White Sox players Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in the United States Eugene Emeralds players Gigantes del Cibao players Living people Major League Baseball outfielders Major League Baseball players from the Dominican Republic Mesa Solar Sox players Myrtle Beach Pelicans players South Bend Cubs players Sportspeople from Santo Domingo Winston-Salem Dash players ","title":"Eloy Jiménez"},{"id":"47139271","text":"In the United States, the phrase testing the waters is used to describe someone who is exploring the feasibility of becoming a candidate for political office. \\"Testing the waters\\" activities are to be paid for with candidate- permissible funds. Once an individual begins to campaign or decides to become a candidate, funds that were raised or spent to \\"test the waters\\" apply to the $5,000 threshold for qualifying as a candidate. This is because there is a federal law that once an individual raises or spends $5,000 for a campaign, they are required to register as a federal candidate. Once that threshold is exceeded, the individual must register with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) (candidates for the United States House of Representatives) or the Secretary of the Senate (candidates for the United States Senate), and begin to file reports (including in the first report all activity that occurred prior to reaching the $5,000 threshold). Once an individual registers as a federal candidate, election restrictions apply, including 2,700 dollars on contributions. Also, once registered as a candidate, individuals cannot coordinate with political action committees (PACs) or Super PACs under campaign finance law. Reporting on \\"testing the waters\\" On July 1st, it was reported that Nancy Rotering allegedly received donations for her congressional campaign in excess of $5,000 as early as January and did not officially register as a candidate with the FEC until March. On June 18, 2015, it was reported that Scott Walker had formed a \\"testing the waters\\" committee. On June 4, 2015, it as reported that the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan legal organization, filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission against Democrat Martin O’Malley and Republicans Jeb Bush, Rick Santorum and Scott Walker alleging violations of federal law “testing the waters.” On June 3, 2015, it was reported that as of June 3, Jeb Bush was still \\"testing the waters\\", and had not registered as a federal candidate.

Life He was born in 1932 in Leitrim Middle, Moyvane (formerly Newtownsandes), north Kerry into a family immersed in Irish traditional music. His mother played traditional fiddle, as did his cousin Barney Enright of Moyvane. Pat's brother Seán is a singer and plays the uilleann pipes. Pat learnt the fiddle from his mother, and Irish step-dancing from the famous Kerry dance master Jeremiah Molyneaux.Pat Ahern, Kerryman North Edition, 19 09 2007, \\"Where did it start?\\" p. 115. See also Daithí Kearney, Ahern entry, Vallely, Fintan (ed.) Companion to Irish Traditional Music, Cork University Press 2011, p. 9. Pat attended primary school in Moyvane (1938–1944), subsequently enrolling at St Michael's College, Listowel (1944–1948). He studied for the Catholic priesthood at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth National Seminary (1950–1957); while there he studied piano and organ under Charles O'Callaghan. He was ordained in 1957, and that year appointed curate in St. John's Parish Tralee, County Kerry, with special responsibility for liturgical music. There he founded St. John's Gregorian Choir. In 1959 he studied for the B.Mus. degree at University College, Cork under Aloys Fleischmann, with Tilly Fleischmann as his piano teacher. He graduated in 1962.John O’Keeffe, Ahern entry, Harry White and Barra Boydell (eds.), Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland, UCD Press, Vol. 1, pp. 8-9. In 1967 he was sent to the Catholic Communications Centre, Booterstown, Dublin, to study Radio and Television production and to set up and direct a Radio Production and Training Unit for clergy and religious. He produced a weekly religious radio programme for RTÉ radio, entitled ‘Network’. Recalled to Kerry in 1973, he was released from parish work by his bishop to devote himself to his work on folk theatre. In 1965 he had founded the group Siamsóirí na Ríochta [Entertainers of the Kingdom] out of which in 1972 developed Siamsa Tíre [Entertainment of the Land], the Folk Theatre of Ireland. Ahern was artistic director until he retired in 1997. He brought the company all over Ireland and travelled the world with it, enchanting audiences wherever they went.See Desmond Rushe, Ireland of the Welcomes, Vol. 28, No. 5, Sep/Oct 1979, pp. 32–34 He retired in 1997, but continues to organise concerts and stage productions.See Simon Brouder, \\"Celebration Time for Siamsa Tíre\\", Kerryman North Edition, 30 04 2014, p. 20 Pat Ahern 2015 Pageants In 1958, a year after taking up his duties as curate in the parish of Tralee, Pat Ahern devised and produced a pageant based on the story of Lourdes entitled Massabielle, involving the parish choir, parish societies and theatre groups, in a celebration to mark the centenary of the Lourdes apparitions. It was presented in the Catholic Young Men's Hall, Tralee. In 1959 he produced a second parish pageant: Bethlehem, the story of Christmas. Then 1963 saw the production of a third parish pageant: Golgotha, the story of the Passion of Christ, involving a cast of 120, in the style of the celebrated Passion Play at Oberammergau in Bavaria. In 1964 Massabielle was reproduced in Tralee. Later pageants: * 1988 – Massabielle presented in Knocknagoshel by the people of Knocknagoshel parish * 1996 – dance performance in Killarney Cathedral during the ordination of Dr William Murphy as new bishop of Kerry commemorating the monastic tradition of the diocese * 1999 – Dance of Life, the story of salvation, to celebrate the new millennium in the diocese of Kerry; cast of 200, choir of 800 recruited from all the parishes of the diocese Music score by Aidan O’Carroll, 12,000 attended * 2002 – Críost Liom, a stage presentation of the life of Blessed Edmund Ignatius Rice, to mark the bicentenary of the founding of the Christian Brothers and Presentation Brothers, at the RDS Concert Hall in Dublin * 2005 – Song of the Living Stones, the story of Christianity in Kerry, presented in Killarney Cathedral to commemorate the 150th anniversary of its consecration * 2008 – Nov 15–25 Massabielle in Tralee to mark the 150th anniversary of the apparitions of Lourdes.  Folk Theatre by Siamsóirí na Ríochta [The Entertainers of the Kingdom] of Kerry  In 1964 Ahern initiated a series of experiments in the promotion of traditional Irish folk culture with a small group of musicians, singers and dancers, drawn from the cast of Golgotha, and using the medium of the theatre as a focus for the experiments. In 1965 the Irish television producer, Liam Ó Murchú of RTÉ, commissioned four 30-minute TV programmes by the group for the Irish Music TV series Aililiú. Thenceforward the group was known as \\"Siamsóirí na Ríochta\\" – The Entertainers of the Kingdom (of Kerry). In 1968 the first Folk Theatre production was presented by the group in Tralee, twice weekly through July and August. They called the new show, SIAMSA, Irish for \\"a coming together for merrymaking\\".Pat Ahern, Kerryman North Edition, 19 09 2007, \\"Where did it start?\\" p. 115. In January and May 1969 SIAMSA was presented at the Dublin Peacock Theatre and at the Abbey Theatre, in 1970 in the Abbey Theatre and the same year in the Cork School of Music, at the invitation of the Joan Denise Moriarty's Cork Ballet Company, and then on Saint Patrick's Day 1971 at the Cork Opera House.The Cork Examiner, 4 Oct 1970, 18 March 1971. At Christmas 1971 the Siamsa Tíre company presented a special Christmas show on RTÉ television: Coinnle na Nollag. In 1972, at the request of Éamonn Casey, Bishop of Kerry, and Brendan O'Regan, Chairman of Bórd Fáilte, the Irish Tourist Board, a ten-year plan was drawn up by Ahern for the development of the Tralee folk theatre, now known nationally as Siamsa Tíre. The first appearance of the newly constituted group took place in Galway, at the Taibhdhearc theatre, in April 1972.Sharon Phelan: Dance in Ireland – Steps, Stages and Stories, Cambridge Scholars Press 2014, Ch. 7, pp.153–4. The following year Bishop Casey recalled Ahern from Dublin to Kerry, and released him from diocesan commitments to work full-time on the new folk theatre project in Tralee.Daithí Kearney, \\"Pat Ahern of North Kerry, Conference Review: The First International Conference on Irish Music and Musicians\\", Musicology Review 6, 2010, p. 259. 1974 Siamsa Tíre, The National Folk Theatre of Ireland In 1974 Siamsa Tíre was incorporated as a company, funded by Bord Fáilte, the Irish Tourist Board, and by Roinn na Gaeltachta (the government department for Irish-speaking districts); Pat Ahern was artistic director and Martin Whelan the manager until his death in 2002. Ahern's aim: \\"To provide through the medium of the theatre an attractive means of accessing our rich cultural heritage. … The Irish language enshrines a vast reservoir of story, poetry and song that is unique among the cultures of the world. Irish scholars, collectors and musicians have left a veritable library of Irish songs and dance tunes, many of which have never been sung or played to the living generations.\\" Siamsa Tíre was to seek ways \\"of bringing these lost treasures to the ears of future audiences, in new and evocative settings, thus making them familiar again and musically interesting to the contemporary ear.\\"Pat Ahern, cited in Dónal Nolan, \\"40th Anniversary of Siamsa Tíre National Folk Theatre\\", Kerryman North Edition, 14 05 2014, p. 17. The establishment of rural training centres was a key concept of Siamsa Tíre's Founding Document of 1972. The rural centre, Tithe Siamsa (Siamsa houses), was to serve as a meeting-place for the people of the district, to provide experience of and training in music, dance and story-telling, and a filter- point where the native talents and folk wealth of the district would be assembled and researched. The first house, \\"Teach Siamsa\\", opened in 1974 at Finuge, north Kerry; it focused on the north Kerry dance tradition. The second opened the following year at Carraig in the west Kerry Gaeltacht, with a focus on the Irish language tradition.See Sharon Phelan: Dance in Ireland – Steps, Stages and Stories, Cambridge Scholars Press 2014, Ch. 7, p. 144. In 1978 Siamsa Tíre moved into the refurbished Theatre Royal Cinema in Tralee. From 1982 Ahern began collaborations with artists from other folk traditions, among others with Argentinian, Bulgarian and Spanish dancers. Up to 1985 the members of the company had all been amateurs, employed on a part-time basis; now a core group of four professionals was established. An educational programme for school visits was devised. In 1991 the company moved into a specially built theatre in Tralee. It opened with a new production, Ding Dong Dedero – Forging the Dance, which explored the process of acquiring one's tradition through the story of young Jerry Molyneaux, son of a north Kerry blacksmith, who became the most influential dance master in Munster, and whose dance has been preserved as a key ingredient of the Siamsa Tíre idiom of folk theatre.Pat Ahern, interview of 2013 with Sharon Phelan, cited in Dance in Ireland – Steps, Stages and Stories, Cambridge Scholars Press 2014, Ch. 7, p. 150. The significance of Siamsa Tíre was summed up by the writer Frank Delaney in 1976 just before the company's first tour to the United States: :Somewhere in there when the dance is high and the music lively there's an echo of all times past, remembered and forgotten. Times that are getting more remote in a world that's intent on bringing news of the future at great speed to people of the present. But there's a need for the past, a need for roots. The search for truth, that great intellectual excursion, often gains its momentum in the search for identity. In a time when identity cards are plastic and processed, Siamsa is a banner of cloth, of an old weave, from a timeless loom. And at the same time it's a very enjoyable evening's theatre.Frank Delaney, \\"Siamsa Tíre\\", Cara Magazine, Aer Lingus Dublin, Oct/Dec 1976.

In this episode, the events of Emma Swan being consumed by the Darkness have left the residents of Storybrooke without \\"The Savior,\\" leaving Regina, Mary Margaret, Hook, David, Henry, Robin, and Belle to find a way to save her, even if it means turning to an unlikely individual that they cannot trust. Meanwhile, Emma finds herself in the Enchanted Forest where she encounters Merida en route to Camelot in her search for Merlin before the darkness consumes her for good.\\"The Dark Swan\\" from The Futon Critic (September 11, 2015) Commentators gave the episode positive reviews, citing the episode's dark and more human tone following the events of the fourth-season finale. Plot Opening sequence Granny's Diner is shown in the forest. Event chronology The Land Without Magic flashbacks take place in 1989, a few years after the events of \\"The Stranger\\" and a few years before \\"Snow Drifts\\". The Camelot flashbacks take place immediately before the scene where King Arthur shows Excalibur to his subjects in \\"The Broken Kingdom\\" and before Lancelot's banishment in the same episode. The Enchanted Forest events take place after \\"Fall\\" and before \\"The Broken Kingdom\\". The Storybrooke events take place after \\"Operation Mongoose Part 2\\" and the present Camelot events take place years after Lancelot's banishment, and before \\"The Price\\". In the Characters' Past In a movie theater in 1989 Minneapolis, Minnesota, a young Emma is watching The Sword in the Stone. She steals a woman's candy bar, and is approached by an usher, who tells Emma \\"Don't do it\\". She expects him to reprimand her, but he instead offers her advice by saying, \\"When you do something that you're not supposed to do, even if you're doing it for the right reason, bad things will happen\\". He also mentions that she will have the opportunity to remove Excalibur from its stone and warns her not to touch it, just before he disappears. In Camelot, before Emma's Arrival King Arthur and two of his knights, Sir Lancelot and Sir Percival, arrive to the location of the stone in which Excalibur is embedded. Sir Kay has found it first and as he tries to pull the sword out, he is turned to ash. Despite this, Arthur proceeds with his mission and manages to successfully pull the sword out, only to discover that the tip is missing. He vows to seek out the missing piece, which is revealed to be the blade of the Dark One's Dagger. In Storybrooke Just moments after Emma absorbs the powers of the Dark One and vanished, leaving behind only the Dagger with her name on it, everyone is left stunned, bewildered, and angry at each other. While Regina is furious over what Emma has done, Mary Margaret still believes that Emma has good in her and that she can be saved. Hook takes the Dagger to summon her back, but to no avail; as Regina explains, Emma has gone to a different world. Later, they learn from the Apprentice that Emma is now in the Enchanted Forest, and he has a wand that was given to him by Merlin, which contains all of the light magic, which can help them find Emma, but it can only open a portal to another realm if it is wielded with \\"two sides of the coin\\", the light and the dark. The Apprentice dies and drops the wand; Regina picks up the wand but cannot use it, as she no longer has darkness anymore (later revealed to be because she didn't believe that she can use it); they need someone \\"wicked\\". Regina and Robin Hood go to the hospital ward to see Zelena. Zelena agrees to help if she could see the wand, but needs something meaningful to Emma so the spell will work. She also cannot use her magic unless Regina removes the cuff that is restricting Zelena's magic, so she asks her to remove it. Regina refuses. Later, at Granny's, Hook and Henry formulate a plan to release Zelena. However, their plan backfires, and Zelena breaks free from the cell, after cutting off her hand to remove the magic cuff, before reattaching her hand. Zelena takes Robin captive and trades him for the wand, which she intends to use to return to Oz. As Zelena opens a portal, which takes the form of a cyclone and substantially drains her powers, Regina takes advantage of Zelena's weakened state to put the cuff back on her wrist, as well as to redirect the portal to take them to the Enchanted Forest, using Emma's blanket to locate her. The cyclone immediately heads towards Granny's diner, and transports everyone in the establishment to the location of Emma's whereabouts. In the Enchanted Forest Emma emerges in the Enchanted Forest through the Vault of the Dark One, and finds herself haunted by the voice of the darkness inside of her, which has manifested as personification of Rumplestiltskin. She struggles to resist, and vows not to hurt her family. Then, Emma runs up to a peddler, but is angered into accidentally choking him. The Dark One tricks Emma into using a transportation spell, and she sees a will-o-the-wisp. The Dark One tells her that for the Wisp to answer her question, she will have to catch it. As she chases it, Emma comes upon a red- headed archer named Merida, who nabs the wisp and places it in her bag. Emma confronts Merida, accidentally using dark magic, and tries to convince her that she needs it to find Merlin. Merida is reluctant to trust Emma, but decides to go with her, keeping the wisp in her bag. Merida informs Emma that more wisps can are born at the Hill of Stones, so they head in that direction. Emma learns that Merida needs the wisp in order to restore her family’s kingdom and save her triplet younger brothers who were kidnapped by the United Clans of her country after they refused to let her rule as queen. After they make camp for the night, the manifestation of Rumplestiltskin tries to guide Emma into betraying Merida once they reach the home of the wisps. The manifestation of Rumplestiltskin tells Emma that once Merida speaks into the Wisp, it will continue to do her bidding until she dies, and thus, the only solution would then be for Emma to kill her. Merida overhears the conversation, and sneaks off to the Hill of Stones by herself. Emma catches up with her in the morning and is goaded by Rumplestiltskin's manifestation, against her better judgment and good nature, to rip Merida's heart out. Before Emma can crush the heart, Hook appears with the others and talks her down from it, and she restores Merida's heart. Once everything has settled down, Merida thanks Emma (much to the latter's shock) for showing her that she has darkness in her, too; she was about to kill the clan leaders who kidnapped her brothers and the experience has convinced her to spare them. Mary Margaret hands Emma the dagger; however, Emma, believing that carrying the dagger would give her too much power and too much temptation to embrace the darkness, wants someone else to possess it. She decides to give the dagger to Regina, due to her previous dark deeds, which makes her the only one capable of killing Emma if necessary. Moments later, King Arthur and some of his knights arrive on horseback in order to proclaim that they have been awaiting Emma's arrival. Arthur believes that Emma will be able to reunite them with Merlin, and everyone involved joins forces on their quest en route to Camelot. In Storybrooke (Six Weeks Later) Six weeks after the group entered Camelot, they awaken in Granny's Diner, back in Storybrooke, where they are wearing Arthurian attire. However, they also find that their memory ends with them entering Camelot. To make matters worse, Emma has embraced the darkness, acquired the Dark One's Dagger, and vows revenge against the others for failing her. Production This episode officially marked the additions of Rebecca Mader and Sean Maguire to series regulars after spending the past two seasons in recurring roles. Reception Ratings This episode posted its lowest numbers ever for a season premiere, placing a 1.8/5 among 18-49s with 5.93 million viewers tuning in, a 48 percent drop from the fourth-season premiere but slightly up from the fourth-season finale. The episode saw an increase of 2.44 million viewers, and a 1.1 increase in the 18-49 demographic with Live+7 DVR viewing included. Which gave the episode an overall audience of 8.37 million viewers, and a 2.9 18-49 rating. Reviews The episode was met with excellent reviews. Critics praised the much darker and human tone of the show, the script, and Emma's role, especially Jennifer Morrison's performance. Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly said, \\"Much like the first season of the fairytale show, it looks like we'll spend most of 5A looking back at what actually happened in those missing six weeks, how Emma became the Dark One, and what it means for Storybrooke. It'll be interesting to see where this season lands overall. Last year, we spent months entombed in a Frozen arc that seemed to stretch on for so long, it made even the warmest of fans feel icy. Putting Emma in the spotlight as the Dark One seems like an attempt to bring some focus back to the show's themes as well as its central characters, despite the fact there are certainly going to be many new ones popping in (and out) over the season. And hey, if we learned anything from last season's Queens of Darkness, it's that maybe we'll at least get some awesome wardrobe changes for Emma. Some darker eyeliner? Strappy awesome three inch stilettos? The possibilities are endless… \\" Amy Ratcliffe of IGN said of the episode, \\"Once Upon a Time got right to the main event in the Season 5 premiere: Emma's transformation into the Dark Swan. They could have dragged the will she/won't she aspect out for several episodes but going this route means a more interesting take on the story and seeing more of Morrison playing the villain. Morrison delivered some of her best work on the show to date, and it's terrific to see the plot focus on a member of the regular cast.\\" Ratcliffe gave the episode an 8.4 rating out of 10. In a review from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, \\"“The Dark Swan” was a tremendous premiere for Once Upon A Time, because it played with the structure of the series to breathe new life into it. Instead of a flashback, we get a flash forward that future flashbacks will illuminate. We'll see how Emma comes to lose her goodness, and how her humanity might be reclaimed. If nothing else, we'll get to see evil Jennifer Morrison, which I'm more than stoked to witness, with what little we got of it tonight. In short, Once Upon A Time is back, and I couldn't be happier.\\" Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club gave the premiere a positive review, giving it a C+ grade for the entire setup, but the final moments received a A+. She said that the Camelot storyline \\"is a 4,000-percent improvement over last year's Frozen plot,\\" and added that \\"if the show goes full-on Dark Emma, it will be hard to turn away.\\" Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.4 out of 5 stars. In a review from Blogcritics, Barbara Bennett praised the changes in the storyline and unique twists in this episode and the upcoming season: \\"I have to say, I really loved the way series creators Adam Horowitz and Eddy Kitsis have merged bits of Arthurian legend into the Once Upon a Time landscape. From the Sword in the Stone to the introduction of Arthur and Lancelot, I think this just might work–and be far more integrated into the series narrative than Frozen had been. And for that I cheer!!\\" Notes References External links 2015 American television episodes Once Upon a Time (season 5) episodes ","title":"The Dark Swan"},{"id":"47139321","text":"Katherine Harley in 1908 Katherine Harley, also known as Katharine Harley and Kate C.

He has lived in France since 1991.  Overview  After graduating in 1996 from National School of Fine Arts of Paris / École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts/, France, he became assistant to the artists :fr:Jochen Gerz and :fr:Esther Shalev Gerz. In 1997 he co-founded the independent art-space GlassBox in Paris, one of the first artist-run-spaces in the French capital. Jan Kopp has been in several international artist-in-residence programs such as PS1/Moma with the Clockwork 2000: P.S.1 & Clocktower National and International Studio Program 1999-2000http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/Details/1606 in New York and Hors les Murs/Institut Français in Brazil with \\"Niemeyer dancing, playing with modernity, run the streets\\" as a subject of his residence in 2014.  Work  Jan Kopp uses different medias – drawing, sound, video, sculpture, performance, - without favoring one or the other. He resists to any temptation of specialization or classification. His works can be small drawings or large- scale installations such as Soulever le monde, created for the Children's gallery of Centre Pompidou, Paris in 2015 or Grand Ensemble' for the Contemporary art center La Criée in Rennes, France. In the most of large-scale installations, the visitor can take part of the work by touching or making in movement one element of it or only by this presence. For instance Das endlose Spiel / The Endless game challenges the visitor as to the nature of both his role and his participation: he can take part in this interplay of tension between the visible and the sensory only by making his way along the ellipse of \\"Das endlose Spiel's\\" platform. As Gaétane Lamarche-Vadel said, Kopp shares with Kawamata inclinations for simple materials, economic, common, clear paths, the incompleteness of the work, make a collective. Most of times, he uses many everyday objects to speak to everyone by putting them out of their usual context. By this move we can see the world differential, the artist says. Jan Kopp seeks to create artworks which don't reveal themselves in one glance. They could appear in one way to the visitor then show a different side or give new meanings another day. The visitors don't see the same thing. The artist is always in a position to create links between art, territory and society. A major exhibition was devoted to him at the Maubuisson abbey (Val d’Oise, France) in 2011. Le Tourniquet (2011), the fruit of an experiment on the drawing medium, can be visited in three places, the Collège des Bernardins in Paris, at Fresnoy in the group exhibition Visions fugitives and at the FRAC Alsace for Affinités déchirures & attractions. In 2015, Jan Kopp, was selected to develop an artistic research in Mulhouse (France) and Kassell (Germany) on the topic of immigration, social memory and expressions of living together in the city. He worked closely with civil society actors, academics and cultural Mulhouse.

She published the first feminist magazine in Bolivia and was one of the founders of the first feminist organization in the country. Biography Ana Rosa Tornero was born in Bolivia in 1907. Beginning in the 1920s, Tornero was teaching and directing public schools in Cochabamba and La Paz, where she served as a professor of philosophy and letters. Simultaneously, was the editor of El Norte newspaper. Later, she served as editor of El Diario de La Paz. She also is credited with publishing the first feminist magazine in La Paz, Ideal Femenino in August, 1922. In the early 1920s, she married educator Roberto Bilbao la Vieja and had one son, who was also named Roberto and also became a teacher. In 1923, María Sánchez Bustamante organized the first feminist group in Bolivia El Ateneo Femenino with the goals of attaining civil and political equality as well as furthering their artistic growth. Charter members were artists, journalists, teachers and writers and included Leticia Antezana de Alberti, Elvira Benguria, Fidelia Corral de Sánchez, Marina Lijerón (who would later marry to Betachini), Julia Reyes Ortiz de Cañedo, Ema Alina Palfray, Emma Pérez de Carvajal, María Josefa Saavedra, Ana Rosa Tornero de Bilbao la Vieja, Ana Rosa Vásquez, and Etelvina Villanueva y Saavedra. They organized their own journal \\"Eco Femenino\\". From its inception, Tornero ran the magazine printing literary submissions and articles on feminism. In the 1920s a group of intellectuals formed a group called La Brasa to explore the concept of Americanism. It initially formed in Santiago del Estero Argentina. Tornero, was a member of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA), which had similar aims and focused on land reform, indigenous rights, and cultural preservation. Tornero was invited by La Brasa members to participate in several poetry readings in 1928 in Santiago del Estero and La Banda. In 1929 El Ateneo Femenino organized the First Female Congress, held in La Paz. Tornero was one of the leaders of the Congress. The agenda adopted at the end of the meeting was one of civic, economic and political liberation, specifically calling for the right to have an identity card, dispose of property, have equal footing as parents, and the right for literate women to vote.\\"Lema, et al. (2006)\\", p35 At the beginning of the 1930s Tornero played a significant role during the Chaco War in soliciting donations via the Radio Illimani and she served as a volunteer with the Bolivian Red Cross. She ventured into film at this time, but it was a short- lived venture. Tornero starred in director José María Velasco Maidana's film, Wara Wara (1930) with Luis Pizarroso Cuenca. After a scene was shot featuring a kiss between the two stars, who were members of the Ateneo de la Juventud (Ateneo Youth) theater group Tornero, Tornero refused to continue. Fearing the film would cause irreparable harm to her reputation, she quit the picture and denounced it, forcing the director to find a new cast. It was later released with Juanita Taillansier in the starring role. In 1947, she attended the Primer Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres in Guatemala City, Guatemala. The purpose of the conference was to allow the women a platform to speak on international issues including peace, political equality, and security of human welfare. Tornero headed the third committee of the conference which focused on human rights including economic security, education, health care and freedom of expression.\\"Miller (1991),\\" p 128 Tornero died 27 February 1984 in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

It was also one of the oldest royal titles. The modern term \\"Two-Ladies-name\\" is a simple derivation from the translation of the Egyptian word nebty.  Etymology  The terms \\"Nebty name\\" and \\"Two- Ladies-name\\" derive from the Egyptian word nbtj (Nebty), which is a dual noun meaning \\"the (two) ladies\\". As a mere noun it is a religious euphemism designating the goddesses Nekhbet and Wadjet as a deified pair. As a royal crest it was thought to represent a unified Egypt.  Heraldic appearance  The Nebty name, similarly to the later Niswt-Bity name, was constructed with two sign groups. The first one shows a griffon vulture sitting on a basket. The second group shows an erect cobra, also sitting on a basket. The oldest versions of the Nebty name showed instead of the cobra the red crown above the second basket. The sign groups forming the Nebty name were never used separately.Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. Routledge, London/New York 1999, , p. 203-205.Wolfgang Helck, Eberhard Otto: Nechbet. In: Kleines Lexikon der Ägyptologie. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1999, , p. 199.  Symbology  The Nebty name was symbolically linked to the two most important goddesses of Ancient Egyptian kingship: Nekhbet and Wadjet. Whilst Nekhbet (Egypt. Nekhebety; \\"she from Nekheb\\") was the \\"mistress of Upper Egypt\\", her pendant Wadjet (Egypt. Wadyt; \\"she who thrives\\" or simply \\"lady of the green\\") was the \\"mistress of Lower Egypt\\". Nekhbet was worshipped as the \\"celestial mother of a king\\", which is expressed in the Ancient Egyptian queen title Mwt-niswt (\\"mother of the king\\"). The cobra of Wadjet was worshipped as the \\"celestial diadem snake on the king's forehead\\", believed to spit fire at anyone who dared to take on the pharaoh. This protective behaviour made Wadjet very popular and already in early dynastic times several deities were depicted as wearing a uraeus on their foreheads. With his Nebty name each pharaoh wished to present himself as the one under the guidance and protection of the two goddesses, thus legitimizing himself as being ruler of the whole of Egypt.  Introduction and history  After the Horus name, the Nebty name is the second oldest royal name of Ancient Egyptian history and also known as the \\"Two- Ladies name\\". Egyptologists such as Toby Wilkinson and Ludwig David Morenz point to an obvious prototype of the Nebty name used before the introduction of the final form: ivory tags from the Abydos tombs of the kings Hor-Aha and Djer and the queen Neithhotep show the Two-Ladies crest with the red crown instead of the cobra over a basket. In the case of Hor-Aha the Nebty crest is of special interest, because it is depicted inside a three-framed building (shrine? tomb?) together with the hieroglyph Men (Gardiner sign Y5; meaning \\"to stay\\" or \\"to endure\\"). It is intensely disputed whether this sign group merely gives the name of a Nebty shrine (Men-Nebty; \\"where the Two Ladies endure\\"), whether it shows Aha's Nebty name inside his tomb or whether it shows, instead, Narmer's Nebty name, indicating that Aha buried Narmer. The ivory tags of kings Djer and Djet show the prototype inside a palace and a shrine, guided by the notation that the kings visited the palace of the Two Ladies or oversaw the building of wine cellars for the Nebty shrine. The first use of the final form of the Nebty crest (vulture and cobra over two baskets) appeared during the reign of king Semerkhet, who called himself Iry-Nebty (\\"guardian of the Two Ladies\\"). After him, every future king used a Nebty name, though not every king of the early dynasties and the Old Kingdom is known by his Nebty name. A further problem in determining Nebty names is a fashion which arose during the reign of king Peribsen. He was the first ruler who used the Nebty crest as a separate name or title. After him, it seems that other rulers used separate Nebty names, too. Evidence for that is the case of king Qa'a. Ivory tag inscriptions reveal that Qa'a obviously used two different Nebty names: Qa'a-Nebty (\\"raised arm of the Two Ladies\\") and Sen- Nebty (\\"kissed by the Two Ladies\\" or \\"brother of the Two Ladies\\"). And king Hotepsekhemwy called himself Sehotep-Nebty (\\"the Two Ladies are pleased (with him)\\"), thus using virtually the same name as he used for his serekh name.Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. Routledge, London/New York 1999, , p. 201, 206–207.Hermann Ranke: Die altägyptischen Personennamen. vol. III. Augustin, Glückstadt 1977, p. 319. Another problem in assigning Nebty names is that during the Old Kingdom Egyptian queens also used the Nebty crest as a part of their birth names. Prominent examples are the queens Hetephernebti and Djefatnebti. This has caused a problem concerning the interpretation of a Nebty name appearing on an ivory stencil from Saqqara. It is disputed whether it was the name of a queen (Djeseret-ankh-Nebty) or just the Nebty name of king Sekhemkhet.Wolfgang Helck: Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit (= Ägyptologische Abhandlungen, vol. 45).

Paul Zehr and illustrated by Kris Pearn. It was first published in hardcover print in September 2014 by ECW Press. In 2015, the book was awarded a silver medal in juvenile fiction by the IPPY Awards. This is Zehr’s third book, but first foray into children’s fiction. Background After his success with previous science books, Becoming Batman and Inventing Iron Man, Zehr was invited to give talks at a variety of venues, from the San Diego Comic-Con International to school assemblies. Often speaking at middle schools, he was asked by his young audience whether his next book would be written for them, grades six to eight. Expanding on the opportunity to write a science book for tweens, Zehr took a special interest in exploring the female role in science, athleticism, forward thinking, and artistry. It was at TEDxEdmonton 2012 where Zehr was giving a talk on \\"the superhero in you\\", that he first met Pearn and their partnership began. Pearn is known for his work on Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, Arthur Christmas, and Surf's Up. Synopsis At the start of her grade eight school year, Jessie, a 13-year-old girl with a penchant for superhero comic books and journaling, is assigned a year-long school project in her Socials class called the Superhero Slam. In a head-to-head debate tournament, each student must choose a superhero to champion and be ready to present why their superhero is the best in a variety of topics including: wisdom and experience, physical strength and agility, perseverance and determination, critical thinking, recovery, courage, preparation, and leadership. With her superhero preferences for real people equipped with additional training and technology (i.e. Batman, Iron Man), Jessie selects Batgirl as her optimal candidate and begins her research into what makes Batgirl the ideal female superhero. In order to further explore how real people can become superheroes, Jessie resolves to put herself through physical and mental conditioning. She practices martial arts with her aunt and learns about disciplines like determination through letters written to “real life superheroes.” She writes to and receives responses from: *Mike Bruen *Kelly Sue DeConnick *Clara Hughes *Bryan Q. Miller *Christie Nicholson *Yuriko Romer *Nicole Stott *Jessica Watson *Hayley Wickenheiser Jessie’s diary entries are accented by Kris Pearn’s illustrations of Jessie and her family and friends.

Reception Kirkus Reviews gave a brief review of Project Superhero, commenting that readers should \\"readily respond to Jessie's mission\\". The book has received an average 4.17 out of 5 star rating on Goodreads, based on 40 overall ratings. Many positive reviewers enjoyed the premise of the book, with comments highlighting Jessie's journey, the female role throughout, and the close relationship between superhero and the average person Although Geek Mom gave a generally positive review, some of the heavier themes discussed (9/11, depression, insulin pumps) may require a \\"parental pre-read\\" before giving the book to its targeted eight to twelve year-old audience.

The original version contained a verse not heard in Hank's version: \\"Left her in that lonely church yard, left my darlin' alone/Now I'm sad, my heart is cryin', as I wander through life alone.\\" Although Williams recorded the song in April 1947, it did not surface until it appeared as the B-side to \\"I Saw the Light\\" in September 1948.

History  The monastery was founded in 1192 from Klaarkamp Abbey near Dokkum (of the filiation of Clairvaux). Aduard Abbey in its turn founded Ihlow Abbey in East Frisia in 1231. In 1259 Aduard took over Termunten Abbey, at that time still in Menterna, previously a Benedictine double monastery (the nuns were dispatched to a separate establishment, the short-lived Midwolde Abbey). Aduard Abbey was considered one of the richest, largest and best-known monasteries in the northern Low Countries. From 1245 it had an abbey school. At the end of the 14th century discipline relaxed for a time, but was re- established. In the abbey's heyday under Abbot Henricus van Rees, in the second half of the 15th century, some 300 monks lived there and played a significant part in the reclamation and cultivation of the land. The abbey perished in the wars that accompanied the Reformation. In 1580 the buildings, including the priceless library and the monastery archives, were destroyed by fire after an attack by the Geuzes. The monks fled to their town house in Groningen. Most of the abandoned abbey buildings were soon demolished and the resulting rubble put to use as building stone for the inhabitants of the surrounding countryside. The abbey is believed to have been formally dissolved in 1594. The last abbot died in 1613. The former abbey precinct is more or less identical with the centre of the present village of Aduard. Site and buildings Former infirmary or refectory The first abbey church, probably built immediately after the foundation, was replaced between 1240 and 1263 by a second, enlarged church. This building, as Ubbo Emmius reports in detail and as was confirmed by excavations from 1939 to 1941, was about 83 metres long and the transept was about 40 metres wide. The nave had three aisles and five bays. The transept had two rectangular chapels to the east of each of the wings. The choir had an ambulatory and seven semi-circular choir chapels, on the model of Clairvaux Abbey. To the south of the church lay the courtyard and the cloister. The infirmary (or refectory) still survives and was restored between 1917 and 1928. It is a large long hall building two storeys in height, made out of brick, with pointed-arch windows and blind windows, and a wooden barrel vault roof, dating from around 1300. The building is now used as a Reformed church.  Letter bricks  Part of the original floor of glazed bricks has survived, including some early 14th-century plaster bricks, each stamped with a letter of the alphabet, which can be moved around to make whole texts.Meijer (2004) Such mediaeval lettered bricks may be seen as an early form of moveable type.Brekle, Herbert E. (1997): „Das typographische Prinzip. Versuch einer Begriffsklärung“, in: Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, Bd. 72, pp. 58–63 (61f.) (PDF)  Aduarder Kring  The high point of the abbey school was in the mid-15th century, when the abbey was able to attract scholars from across Northern Europe, including Wessel Gansfort, Rudolf Agricola and Alexander Hegius. They came to debate in the abbey's little academy, the Aduarder kring (\\"Aduard circle\\").

The program was originally established in 2011 as an afternoon show on CJCL. The program gained a television simulcast on The Score (now Sportsnet 360) in 2013. On July 1, 2015, the program was re-launched on Sportsnet as a dedicated television program. On October 14, 2019, the Tim & Sid telecasts began simulcasting on CJCL, replacing Prime Time Sports as its late afternoon drive program. Tim & Sid airs weeknights from 5 to 7 p.m. ET. The telecast is frequently shortened to 90 minutes to allow for pre-game coverage of Toronto Blue Jays and National Hockey League (NHL) games. However, the program airs from 5 to 7 p.m. uninterrupted on CJCL. When neither Tim nor Sid are able to host, Donnovan Bennett, Faizal Khamisa, Alex Seixeiro, or Danielle Michaud would serve as substitute hosts.  History  Tim & Sid was launched in 2011 as an afternoon radio show on CJCL, a sports talk radio station owned by Rogers Media in Toronto. The program gained a television simulcast on Micallef and Seixeiro's previous home, The Score in May 2013, coinciding with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission's (CRTC) approval of Rogers' acquisition of the network (since renamed Sportsnet 360). Tim & Sid became known for the pair's freeform style, and proved popular among a younger audience and a loyal group of fans. The program gained further attention from viral videos during the 2014 Winter Olympics, such as their live reaction to Canada's winning goal in the gold medal game of the Women's hockey tournament. On January 20, 2015, Rogers announced major changes to CJCL's lineup, including the replacement of Tim & Sid with Greg Brady and Andrew Walker as its new afternoon show. Concurrently, Sportsnet announced that Tim & Sid would be re-launched as a television program, premiering on July 1, 2015. Scott Moore, president of Sportsnet and NHL properties at Rogers, likened Tim & Sid to being a \\"sports content factory\\" operating across multiple platforms (including television and social media), and explained that Micallef and Seixeiro \\"are not just highlight guys, they know how to engage on any sports topic and the great thing about these guys is they can connect with sports fans on any number of levels.\\" In 2019, when the Toronto Raptors won their first NBA championship, Micallef and Seixeiro co-hosted Rogers coverage on Sportsnet and Citytv of the championship parade alongside Breakfast Television Toronto’s Dina Pugliese.Tim And Sid live with BT at Raptors Parade Breakfast Television On September 25, 2019, it was announced that a simulcast of the program would air on CJCL beginning October 14, replacing Prime Time Sports.

As of 2015, Bay Ships was a subsidiary of Fincantieri Marine Group and produces articulated tug and barges, OPA-90 compliant double hull tank ships and offshore support vessels. It also provides repair services to the lake freighter fleet. In the past the shipyard located in Sturgeon Bay has operated under several different names and traces its history back to 1918. The company also built 40,000 ton Lake freighters in the 1970s and 1980s. While capable of producing large freighters, the yard has not built a freighter over 20,000 tons since 1987. Former names of the shipyards at the 2015 location of Bay Shipbuilding are: Sturgeon Bay Shipbuilding, Leathem D. Smith Shipbuilding Company and Christy Corporation.  History as Bay Shipbuilding   1968 to 1979  Bay Shipbuilding Company was formed in 1968 after The Manitowoc Company closed Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company and purchased Sturgeon Bay Shipbuilding and then Christy Corporation in 1970, which were adjacent on the east side of the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal. Sturgeon Bay Shipbuilding & Dry Dock was formerly Rieboldt, Wolter & Co., Universal Shipbuilding Company and Sturgeon Bay Dry Dock Company. Christy Corporation was formerly Leathem D. Smith Towing & Wrecking Company, Leathem D. Smith Dock Company and Leathem D. Smith Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company. Bay Shipbuilding initially invested $500,000 in purchasing the two yards. In the early 1970s they invested $30 million for improvements. The 1970s turned out to be a boom period for Bay Shipbuilding since Great Lakes shipping fleet owners had decided to upgrade their fleets. They would build 30 ships for the lake fleet in the 1970s. In 1975, Bay Shipbuilding had around 800 workers and expected to expand to 1,400 because of a new contract to construct four 1,000 foot long lake freighters for the American Steamship Company and Bethlehem Steel. At least six of the 1,000 foot long, 40,000 ton self-unloading ore carriers were delivered from 1977 to May 1981. By the end of 1978, Bay Shipbuilding employed nearly 2,000.  1980s and 1990s  A drawing of Bay Shipbuilding, c.1985. After the construction projects for new lake freighters had dried up, Bay Shipbuilding entered the salt-water shipbuilding market. By 1984, employment had fallen to around 220. Bay shipbuilding received a contract with Sea-Land Service for three container ships for around $180 million later that year. The ships were Sea-Land's only vessels designed and built in the United States. However, Bay Shipbuilding did not win the contracts by underbidding foreign shipyards. Since the ships were destined for the Puget Sound to Alaska trade route, the Jones Act required that the ships be made in the United States. In March 1988, after the completion of the three Sea-Land container ships, Bay Shipbuilding announced it was ceasing new shipbuilding due to the lack of domestic contracts and a decline in the US shipbuilding industry. In the mid-1990s, the nearby Peterson Builders shipyard closed. In the late 1990s, the yard built a handful of smaller vessels including a ferry, two tugs, a dredge and the 475 foot tank barge Seneca (later named DBL 140).  2000s – present  A view of Bay Shipbuilding from Potawatomi State Park, July 2008. In the 2000s, Bay shipbuilding continued to construct Oil Pollution Act of 1990 compliant double hulled tank barges and more recently Articulated tug and barges and Offshore Support Vessels. The Manitowoc Company sold its marine business, which included Bay Shipbuilding, to Fincantieri Marine Group, effective at the end of the day 31 December 2008. Prior to 2015, Fincantieri added a new floating dry dock and Computer-aided manufacturing equipment during a $26 million capital expansion plan.  Predecessor companies   Sturgeon Bay Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company and predecessors  Universal Shipbuilding Company and the Sturgeon Bay Dry Dock Company merged in 1926 and formed the Sturgeon Bay Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company. Sturgeon Bay SB&DDC; changed ownership in April 1934 and employed around 90 workers at the time. They built fishing vessels, tow boats and ferries prior to World War II. During the war Sturgeon Bay SB&DDC; built some Design 210, 150 foot Steel Diesel Retrieving Vessels for the US Army (H-2 to H-12). They also built Design 216, 100 foot Steel Diesel Supply Boats (F 5 to F 14 and F 125 to F 130) for the Army. Additionally, they built a fairly large number of 45 foot tugs and a few 86 foot tugs as well. After the war, Sturgeon Bay SB&DDC; built ferries, tugboats, towboats, a yacht or two and fishing vessels. Most of the vessels were under 100 feet long. By 1949 employment at Sturgeon Bay SB&DDC; was around 225. 20 tugs were built for Mississippi River barge pushing in the 1950s. In the 1960s, Sturgeon Bay SB&DDC; built a number of fishing trawlers that were around 100 feet long for the New England fishing industry. As mentioned above, in 1968 Sturgeon Bay SB&DDC; was purchased by the Manitowoc Company and renamed Bay Shipbuilding.  Christy Corporation and predecessors  Christy Corporation was formed just after World War II from Leathem D. Smith Shipbuilding which had been previously named, Leathem D. Smith Towing & Wrecking Company, Leathem D. Smith Dock Company and Leathem D. Smith Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company. During World War II, Leathem D. Smith Shipbuilding built some Type N3 ships and a number of 175 foot PC-461-class submarine chasers, like . They also built several Tacoma-class frigates, like . Toward the end of the war, Leathem built net laying ships, water tankers and several 389 foot Type C1 ships as well. During the war, Leathem averaged a ship delivered every 20 days. The yard peaked at about 5,000 workers during the war. As Christy Corporation, in the 1950s the yard built and , Wisconsin to Michigan ferries. They also built s, like and Landing Craft Utility ships (LCU-1610 type) for the US Navy. In the 1960s, Christy built a variety of different ship types, such as , , , NOAAS David Starr Jordan (R 444), and .

Its use among professional players has become so universal that it is only in France and Vienna that any other kind of horn is used today. A musician who plays the German horn is called a horn player (or less frequently, a hornist). The word \\"German\\" is used only to distinguish this instrument from the now-rare French and Viennese instruments. Although the expression \\"French horn\\" is still used colloquially in English for any orchestral horn (German, French, or Viennese), since the 1930s professional musicians and scholars have generally avoided this term in favour of just \\"horn\\". Vienna horns today are played only in Vienna, and are made only by Austrian firms. German horns, by contrast, are not all made by German manufacturers (e.g., Paxman in London; Conn in the US), nor are all French-style instruments made in France (e.g., Reynolds, during the 1940s and 50s in the US). Name The name \\"German horn\\" is used to distinguish this instrument from other, similar types of orchestral horn, such as the French horn (in the sense of the type of instrument designed by French makers and favoured by French players) and the Vienna horn. The adjective is normally omitted when referring to the instrument, which in colloquial usage is sometimes confusingly referred to as the \\"French\\" horn. The added word \\"French\\" is still found in some tutors and instrumental books, but is now regarded as a colloquialism, having passed out of the usage of composers, scholars, and professional players since about 1930 because of the increasing ubiquity of the German horn. Since that time, the true French horn's use has been confined mainly to France, and even in that country the German horn was already gaining favour with some French players as early as 1938. History In the late seventeenth century, French makers became preeminent in the manufacture of hunting horns, and were credited with the creation of the now- familiar, circular \\"hoop\\" shape of the instrument. As a result, even in England these instruments were often referred to by their French names, trompe de chasse or cor de chasse (the clear modern distinction between trompes'—trumpets—and cors—horns—did not exist at that time). When, early in the eighteenth century, crooks were invented in order to make such horns playable in different keys, they were first devised by German makers. Since these new instruments (which had appeared as early as 1704) were also popularized in England starting in the 1730s by the playing of the sons and grandsons of German emigrant Nicholas Jacob Christopher Messing, the national designators \\"French\\" and \\"German\\" came to be used to distinguish the simple hunting horn from the newer horn with crooks, which was also called by the Italian name corno cromatico. The national rivalry between French and German makers continued into the era of the valved horn. Although French designs for brass-instrument valves exist from as early as 1815, a design incorporating the use of valves on the horn was first patented in 1818 by the German makers Heinrich Stölzel and Friedrich Blümel. The French followed by about 1839 with a rival design, using the piston valves perfected by François Périnet. By the middle of the 19th century the most common type of single F horn was the German horn, with three rotary valves and a centrally placed slide crook. This instrument remained the dominant type of orchestral horn until the 1920s, by which time it had been supplanted by the (also German) double horn, introduced in 1897 by Fritz Kruspe of Erfurt. The French horn, using either two or three piston valves (also called Périnet valves after their inventor) and with crooks inserted at the mouthpipe end, continued to be preferred by many British orchestral players until the 1930s.; By the mid-1940s, however, the German horn was achieving dominance in the UK. The last great British exponent of the French instrument was Dennis Brain who, even after the Second World War continued to favour the purer tone of his 1818 Raoux single horn until finally abandoning it for a four-valved B/A Alexander model 90 in October 1951. Though he did not like the sound as much, he said he \\"was paid to get the notes\\" and the German horn was \\"virtually foolproof\\" in contrast to the French horn. His father, Aubrey Brain, also a celebrated horn player and lifelong champion of the French style of instrument, declared that his son had given up the horn altogether. By the 1990s even players in France were turning to the darker- toned German instrument. Construction Rotary valves of a German double horn German horns have lever-operated rotary valves, in contrast to the French horn, which uses piston valves (similar to a trumpet's), and the Vienna horn which uses double-piston valves, or pumpenvalves. A horn without valves is known as a natural horn, changing pitch along the natural harmonics of the instrument. Pitch may also be controlled by the position of the hand in the bell, in effect reducing the bell's diameter. The pitch of any note can easily be raised or lowered by adjusting the hand position in the bell. Three valves control the flow of air in the single horn, which is tuned to F or nowadays with increasing frequency among first (or \\"high\\") horn players in B. The more common double horn has a fourth valve, usually operated by the thumb, which routes the air to one set of tubing tuned to F or another tuned to B. Triple horns with five valves are also made, tuned in F, B, and a descant E or F. Also common are \\"descant\\" doubles, which typically provide B and high-F branches. This configuration provides a high-range horn while avoiding the additional complexity and weight of a triple. Character The sound and playing character of the German horn is distinctly different from those of the French model (the instrument of Franck, Debussy and Ravel), which is smaller in volume and regarded as more refined. The tone of the German horn is warm, rich, and dark in contrast to the French horn, which is light, brilliant, and open. Types German horns may be classified as single, double, compensating double, and triple horns. Single horn German single horn in B From the second half of the nineteenth century until the 1920s, \\"German horn\\" meant the most common type of F horn, with a bore as wide as in the cylindrical valve portion of the instrument. It had three rotary valves and was fitted with a slide-crook which also served as a master tuning slide. The German horn had a broader bell than the \\"French\\" single horn and was played using a conical mouthpiece with a flat-edged rim. French makers, by contrast, preferred to preserve as much as possible the character of the natural horns exemplified by the instruments built in the eighteenth century by Raoux, which meant a narrower bore between and, in many earlier models, a removable set of piston valves which could be replaced by a simple centre crook to transform the instrument for hand-horn use. After about 1847, the French generally used an \\"ascending\\" third valve which normally sends the air through the extra length of the valve slide but, when, depressed, cuts out the slide instead of adding it as in the German horn and older French horns. Single horns use a single set of tubes connected to the valves. This allows for simplicity of use and a much lighter weight. They are usually in the keys of F or B, although many F horns have longer slides to tune them to E, and most B horns have a fourth valve to put them in the key of A. The problem with single horns is the inevitable choice between accuracy or tone. While the F horn has the \\"typical\\" horn sound, above third-space C accuracy is a concern for the majority of players because, by its nature, one plays high in the horn's harmonic series where the overtones are closer together. This led to the development of the B horn, which, although easier to play accurately, has a less desirable sound in the mid and especially the low register where it is not able to play all of the notes. The solution has been the development of the double horn, which combines the two into one horn with a single lead pipe and bell. Both main types of single horns are still used today as student models because they are cheaper and lighter than double horns. In addition, the single B horns are sometimes used in solo and chamber performances and the single F survives orchestrally as the Vienna horn. Additionally, single F alto and B alto descants are used in the performance of some baroque horn concertos and F, B, and F-alto (an octave above the usual F horn) singles are occasionally used by jazz performers. Dennis Brain's benchmark recordings of the Mozart Horn Concerti were made on a single B/A instrument by Alexander Brothers, now on display at the Royal Academy of Music in London. Double horn valves of a Conn 6D double horn. The three lever keys (above the large valves) can be depressed toward the large outer tube. The thumb key (near the left-most valve) moves inward toward the three finger keys. thumbrightScheme of a double horn (view from underneath) Despite the introduction of valves, the single F horn proved difficult for use in the highest range, where the partials grew closer and closer, making accuracy a great challenge. An early solution was simply to use a single horn of higher pitch—usually in B. Late in the nineteenth century a new design was worked out by the German horn maker Ed. Kruspe (namesake of his family's brass instrument firm), in collaboration with a nephew of the horn player F. A. Gumbert, who introduced a prototype of the \\"double horn\\" in Markneukirchen in 1897. The French maker Pierre Louis Gautrot, in the meantime, had been experimenting along similar lines from 1858 onwards. In 1864 he patented his \\"système équitonique\\", originally conceived not for the horn but rather as a \\"compensating system\\" to correct the intonation of the lowest notes of the euphonium and the bombardon. It was eventually applied also to the horn, but the extra weight and cost proved excessive. Although the French firm Jérôme Thibouville-Lamy in about 1928 introduced a piston-valved double-horn with ascending third valve, designed in collaboration with the horn player Louis Vuillermoz, the double horn has continued to be identified mainly as a German horn. The double horn essentially combines two instruments into a single frame: one horn in F, and a second, higher horn keyed in B. Like the single horn it has three valves, but each has a double set of tubing, the first tuned in F and a shorter set in B. By depressing a fourth valve (usually operated by the thumb), the horn player can quickly switch from the deep, warm tones of the F horn to the higher, brighter tones of the B horn. The two sets of tones are commonly called \\"sides\\" of the horn. Using the fourth valve not only changes the basic length (and thus the harmonic series and pitch) of the instrument, it also causes the three main valves to use proportionate slide lengths. Other double-horn combinations have also been made, for example with the F side above the B side, an octave higher than the usual F horn, and \\"double B\\" and \\"double F\\" horns, each with the two sides an octave apart. In the twentieth century German horn makers devised further variations on the double-horn pattern. One of these was the \\"omnitonic\\" horn invented by Hermann Prager in 1918 and built by Knopf of Markneukirchen, but its complicated mechanism made the instrument very heavy. A more successful model which added a valve to lower both sides of the instrument by a semitone (from B to A and from F to E) was patented by Paul Geyer of Schwerin in 1924. The extra valve not only made playing difficult passages in sharp keys easier, but also acted as a \\"compensating\\" mechanism for the otherwise sharp pitch of stopped notes on the B side. In the United States, the two most common styles (\\"wraps\\") of double horns are named Kruspe and Geyer/Knopf, after the German instrument makers who first developed and standardized them. The Kruspe wrap locates the B change valve above the first valve, near the thumb. The Geyer wrap has the change valve behind the third valve, near the little finger (although the valve's trigger is still played with the thumb). In effect, the air flows in a completely different direction in the two models. Kruspe-wrap horns tend to be larger in the bell throat than the Geyer-wrap horns. Typically, Kruspe models are constructed from nickel silver (also called German silver), while Geyer horns tend to be of yellow brass. Both models have their own strengths and weaknesses, and while the choice of instrument is very personal, an orchestral horn section is usually found to have either one or the other, owing to the differences in tone color, response, and projection of the two different styles. In Europe the most popular German horns are arguably those made by Alexander Brothers of Mainz and by Paxman in London. In Germany and the Benelux countries, the Alexander 103 is extremely popular. These horns do not fit strictly into the Kruspe or Knopf camps, but have features of both. Alexander prefers the traditional medium bell size, which they have produced for many years, whereas Paxman offer their models in a range of bell throat sizes. In the United States, the Conn 8D, a mass-produced instrument based on the Kruspe design, has been extremely popular in many areas (New York, Los Angeles, Cleveland, Philadelphia). Since roughly the early 1990s, however, for reasons ranging from changing tastes to a general dislike of Conn's newer 8Ds, orchestras have been moving away from the popular Conn 8D. Geyer model horns (by Carl Geyer, Karl Hill, Keith Berg, Steve Lewis, Jerry Lechniuk, Dan Rauch, and Ricco-Kuhn) are used in other areas (San Francisco, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Boston, Houston). The CF Schmidt double, with its unique piston change valve, is occasionally found in sections playing Geyer/Knopf model equipment. =Compensating double horn= The first design of the double horn did not have a separate set of slides pitched in F. Rather, the main key of the horn was B (the preference of German horn players) and it could be played in F by directing air through the B slides, an F extension, and another set of smaller slides. This \\"compensated\\" for the longer length of the F slides, producing a horn now called the compensating double. It was, and still is, widely used by European horn players because of its light weight and ease of playing, especially in the high register. Triple horn In the second half of the twentieth century the principle of the German double horn was extended by adding yet another \\"side\\" to create the triple horn. This design was developed by the horn player Richard Merewether and the London firm of Paxman to afford the player even more security in the high register. One variation adds to the F and B horns a third, descant horn in high F, an octave above the normal F horn, though it may alternatively be pitched in B. It is activated through the use of a second thumb valve. The triple horn was met with considerable resistance when it first appeared. Horn players were reluctant to spend far more money for a triple horn than they would for a double horn, and they were much heavier than the average double horn. Players noted that their arms became fatigued much faster. Moreover, the combination of three different horns creates issues with sonority, because the piping shared among all three sides (that is, the lead pipe and bell) are mathematically disproportionate to two or all three horn lengths. Horn makers have had to make concessions to \\"even out\\" the sound between all three, often to the loss of sound quality of each side or entire ranges of the instrument. Advances in horn production are gradually eliminating these drawbacks, and the triple horn is gaining popularity. They are rarely available in anything lower than professional quality. Like double horns, triple horns can come in both full and compensating wraps. Today they are found being played in many professional orchestras, although the substantial cost difference between double and triple horns limits their usage elsewhere. Related horns The variety in horn history necessitates consideration of the natural horn, French horn, Vienna horn, mellophone, marching horn, and Wagner tuba. Natural horn A natural horn has no valves, but can be tuned to a different key by inserting different tubing, as during a rest period. The natural horn is the ancestor of the modern horn. It is essentially descended from hunting horns, with its pitch controlled by air speed, aperture (opening of the lips through which air passes) and the use of the right hand moving in and out of the bell. Today it is played as a period instrument. The natural horn can only play from a single harmonic series at a time because there is only one length of tubing available to the horn player. A proficient player can indeed alter the pitch by partially muting the bell with the right hand, thus enabling the player to reach some notes that are not part of the instrument's natural harmonic series—of course this technique also affects the quality of the tone. The player has a choice of key by using crooks to change the length of tubing. French horn French single horn by Jean Baptiste Arban, with three Périnet valves The French horn (when the name is used specifically for a horn type) in modern use is a narrow-bore horn () with three Périnet (piston) valves. It retains the narrow bell-throat and mouthpipe crooks of the orchestral hand horn of the late eighteenth century, and most often has an \\"ascending\\" third valve. This is a whole-tone valve arranged so that with the valve in the \\"up\\" position the valve loop is engaged, but when the valve is pressed the loop is cut out, raising the pitch by a whole tone. Some early examples had only two valves, and on others the valve section, called the sauterelle, could be removed and replaced by a simple main tuning slide and coupling tubes, allowing the instrument to be played as a natural horn. Vienna horn Vienna horn The Vienna horn is a special horn used primarily in Vienna, Austria. Instead of using rotary valves or piston valves, it uses the pumpenvalve (or Vienna valve), which is a double-piston operating inside the valve slides, and usually situated on the opposite side of the corpus from the player's left hand, and operated by a long pushrod. Unlike the German horn, which has grown considerably larger internally (for a bigger, broader, and louder tone), and considerably heavier (with the addition of valves and tubing in the case of the double horn) the Vienna horn very closely mimics the size and weight of the natural horn, (although the valves do add some weight, they are lighter than rotary valves) even using crooks in the front of the horn, between the mouthpiece and the instrument. The bore of the Vienna horn is even smaller than that of the French horn, averaging only . Vienna horn players use a conical F crook inserted at the mouthpipe end. Vienna horns are often used with funnel shaped mouthpieces similar to those used on the natural horn, with very little (if any) backbore and a very thin rim. The Viennese horn requires very specialized technique and can be quite challenging to play, even for accomplished players of modern horns. The Vienna horn has a warmer, softer sound than the modern horn. Its pumpenvalves facilitate a continuous transition between notes (glissando); conversely, a more precise operating of the valves is required to avoid notes that sound out of tune. Mellophone A mellophone Two instruments are called a mellophone. The first is an instrument shaped somewhat like a horn, in that it is formed in a circle. It has piston valves and is played with the right hand on the valves. Manufacturing of this instrument sharply decreased in the middle of the twentieth century, and this mellophone (or mellophonium) rarely appears today. The second instrument is used in modern brass bands and marching bands, and is more accurately called a \\"marching mellophone\\" or simply \\"mellophone\\". A derivative of the F alto horn, it is usually keyed in F, occasionally in G. It is shaped like a flugelhorn, with piston valves played with the right hand and a forward-pointing bell. These horns are generally considered better marching instruments than regular horns because their position is more stable on the mouth, they project better, and they weigh less. It is primarily used as the middle voice of drum and bugle corps. Though they are usually played with a V-cup cornet-like mouthpiece, their range overlaps the common playing range of the horn. This mouthpiece switch makes the mellophone louder, less mellow, and more brassy and brilliant, making it more appropriate for marching bands. Often now with the use of converters, traditional conical horn mouthpieces are used to achieve the more mellow sound of a horn to make the marching band sound more like a concert band. As they are pitched in F or G and their range overlaps that of the horn, mellophones can be used in place of the horn in brass and marching band settings. Mellophones are, however, sometimes unpopular with horn players because the mouthpiece change can be difficult and requires a different embouchure. Because the bore is more cylindrical than the orchestral horn the \\"feel\\" of the mellophone can be foreign to a horn player. Another unfamiliar aspect of the mellophone is that it is designed to be played with the right hand instead of the left (although it can be played with the left). Intonation can also be an issue when playing the mellophone. In orchestral or concert band settings, regular concert horns are normally preferred to mellophones because of their tone, which blends better with woodwinds and strings, and their greater intonational subtlety—since the player can adjust the tuning by hand. For these reasons, mellophones are played more usually in marching bands and brass band ensembles, occasionally in jazz bands, and almost never in orchestral or concert band settings. While horn players may be asked to play the mellophone, it is unlikely that the instrument was ever intended as a substitute for the horn, mainly because of the fundamental differences described. As an instrument, it compromises between the ability to sound like a horn and a playing position like a trumpet or flugelhorn, a tradeoff that sacrifices acoustic properties for ergonomics. Marching horn The marching horn is similar to the mellophone in shape and appearance, but is pitched in the key of B (the same as the B side of a regular double horn). It is also available in F alto (one octave above the F side of a regular double horn). The marching horn is also normally played with a horn mouthpiece (unlike the mellophone, which needs an adapter to fit the horn mouthpiece). These instruments are primarily used in marching bands so that the sound comes from a forward-facing bell, as dissipation of the sound from the backward-facing bell becomes a concern in open-air environments. Many college marching bands and drum corps prefer mellophones, which better balance the tone of the other brass instruments. Wagner tuba Double Wagner tuba The Wagner tuba is a rare brass instrument that is essentially a horn modified to have a larger bell throat and a vertical bell. Like the German horn, it uses rotary valves. Despite its name, it is not considered part of the tuba family. Invented for Richard Wagner specifically for his work Der Ring des Nibelungen, it has been used subsequently by other composers, including Bruckner, Stravinsky and Richard Strauss. It uses a horn mouthpiece and is available as a single tuba in B or F, or, more recently, as a double tuba similar to the double horn. Its common range is similar to that of the euphonium, but its possible range is the same as that of the horn, extending from low F, below the bass clef staff to high C above the treble staff when read in F. These low pedals are substantially easier to play on the Wagner tuba than on the horn. Repertory When writing for the horn, composers rarely specify the particular type of instrument (natural, French, German, or Vienna), but the ubiquity of the German horn means that this is the type of instrument most often heard today in horn repertoire composed from the eighteenth century to the present. Orchestra and concert (and military) band The horn is most often used as an orchestral and concert-band instrument, with its singular tone being employed by composers to achieve specific effects. In the orchestral repertory, Leopold Mozart, for example, used horns to signify the hunt, as in his Jagdsinfonie (hunting symphony). Telemann wrote much for the horn, and it features prominently in the work of Handel and in Bach's Brandenburg Concerto no. 1. Once the technique of hand- stopping had been developed, allowing fully chromatic playing, composers began to write seriously for the horn. Gustav Mahler made great use of the horn's uniquely haunting and distant sound in his symphonies, notably the famous Nachtmusik (serenade) section of his Symphony No. 7. Band works with prominent horn parts include Gustav Holst's First Suite in E for Military Band. Many composers have written works that have become favorites in the horn repertoire. These include Poulenc (Elegie) and Saint-Saëns (Morceau de Concert for horn and orchestra, op. 94 and Romance, op. 36). Others, particularly Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whose friend Joseph Leutgeb was a noted horn player, wrote extensively for the instrument, including concerti and other solo works. Mozart's A Musical Joke satirizes the limitations of contemporary horn playing, including the risk of selecting the wrong crook by mistake. The development of the valve horn was exploited by romantic composers such as Bruckner, Mahler, and Richard Strauss, whose father was a well-known professional horn player. Strauss's Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks contains one of the best known horn solos from this period, relying on the chromatic facility of the valved horn. Brahms had a lifelong love-affair with the instrument, with many prominently featured parts throughout his four symphonies. Solo repertory In the eighteenth century some outstanding concertos were written for solo horn and orchestra by Telemann, Christoph Förster, Michael and Joseph Haydn, Leopold and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Carl Stamitz. Concerti grossi include concertos for two horns by Vivaldi and Bach’s First Brandenburg Concerto. At the end of the century Beethoven composed a Sonata for Horn and Piano in F major, Op. 17, for the Bohemian virtuoso Giovanni Punto (Jan Václav Stich), a master of hand-horn technique. In the early nineteenth century, Carl Maria von Weber, in addition to giving the horn a prominent orchestral place in the overtures to the operas Oberon and Der Freischütz, composed a spectacularly difficult Concertino in E Minor which, amongst other things, includes an early use of multiphonics, produced by humming into the instrument while playing. Gioachino Rossini exploited the instrument's association with hunting in a piece called Rendez-vous de chasse for four corni da caccia and orchestra (1828). All of these works were written for the natural horn. The advent of the valved horn brought new possibilities, which were exploited by Robert Schumann in two works written in 1849: the Adagio and Allegro for horn and piano Op. 70 and the Concertstück for four horns and orchestra. Other important works from this era are the concertos by Saverio Mercadante, Franz Strauss, and the First Concerto (1882–83) by his son Richard Strauss. Camille Saint-Saëns did not write a concerto as such, but did compose two Romances for horn (or cello) and orchestra, Op. 67 in E major (1866), and Op. 36 in F major (1874), and a Morceau de concert Op. 94 (1887) for horn and orchestra. Chamber music The horn is a standard member of the wind quintet and brass quintet, and often appears in other configurations. Notable works from the late-eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries include two quintets by Mozart, one in E major for horn, violin, two violas, and cello (KV407/386c) and the other for piano, oboe, clarinet, bassoon and horn (KV452). Beethoven also wrote a Quintet for piano and winds, Op. 16, as well as a Sextet for two horns and strings, Op. 81b, and a Septet in E major, Op. 20, for clarinet, horn, bassoon, violin, viola, cello, and double bass. One of Schubert’s last works is the Octet (D803), written in 1824, which adds a second violin to Beethoven's Septet scoring. The combination of horn with violin and piano is called a horn trio, and though Brahms's Horn Trio was not the first example, it nevertheless was the first important work in the genre and inspired many later composers to write for the same grouping, notably Lennox Berkeley (ca.1953), Don Banks (1962), and György Ligeti (1982).

Since the Abbasid period, there were two main caravans, departing from Damascus and Cairo. Each of the two caravans was annually assigned an amir al-hajj. The main duties entrusted to an amir al-hajj were securing funds and provisions for the caravan, and protecting it along the desert route to the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina in the Hejaz (modern-day Saudi Arabia).Al-Damurdashi, 1991, p. 20 Significance of the office According to historian Thomas Philipp, \\"the office of amir al-hajj was an extremely important one\\", which brought with it great political influence and religious prestige.Philipp, 1998, p. 101 Given the significance of the Hajj pilgrimage in Islam, the protection of the caravan and its pilgrims was a priority for the Muslim rulers responsible. Any mishandling of the caravan or harm done to the pilgrims by Bedouin raiders would often be made known throughout the Muslim world by returning pilgrims. The leader of the Muslim world, or the ruler aspiring to this position, was required to ensure the pilgrimage's safety, and its success or failure significantly reflected on the ruler's prestige.Singer, 2002, p. 142 Thus, \\"talented and successful Hajj commanders were crucial\\".Singer, 2002, p. 141 In Ottoman times, the importance of successful umara' al-hajj generally rendered them immune from punitive measures by the Ottoman authorities for abuses they committed elsewhere. Duties The main threat to a Hajj caravan was Bedouin raiding. An amir al-hajj would command a large military force to protect the caravan in the event of an attack by local Bedouin or would pay off the various Bedouin tribes whose territories the caravan inevitably traversed on the way to the Muslim holy cities in the Hejaz. The procurement of supplies, namely water and foodstuffs, and transportation, namely camels, were also the responsibility of the amir al-hajj, as was securing the funds to finance the pilgrimage. The funds mostly came from province revenues specifically designated for the Hajj. Some funds came from large endowments established by various Mamluk and Ottoman sultans that were mainly meant to ensure the availability of water and supplies in the cities of Mecca and Medina to accommodate incoming pilgrims. The Cairene commander was responsible for the kiswah, which was the black cloth that is annually draped over the Kaaba in Mecca. According to Singer and Philipp, an amir al-hajj needed to possess logistical capabilities in addition to military skills. To procure supplies and ensure safe transportation for the caravan, the amir al-hajj often maintained a network of connections to various Ottoman officials and local community leaders. An amir al-hajj brought with him an array of officials, including additional mamluk commanders to maintain order and religious functionaries, such as imams, muezzins, qadis, all of whom were typically educated Arabs. Other officials included Arab desert guides, doctors, an official in charge of intestate affairs for pilgrims who died during the pilgrimage, and a muhtasib who was in charge of overseeing financial transactions. History An Arabic manuscript by Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti depicting a Mamluk-era Hajj caravan en route to Mecca from the Levant, 1237 Muslim tradition ascribes the first Hajj caravan to the lifetime of Muhammad, who in 630 (AH 9) instructed Abu Bakr to lead 300 pilgrims from Medina to Mecca. With the Muslim conquests, large numbers of pilgrims converged from all the corners of the expanding Muslim world. Under the Abbasids, the tradition began of annual, state-sponsored caravans setting out from Damascus and Cairo, with the pilgrim caravans from remoter regions usually joining them. A third major point of departure was Kufa, where pilgrims from Iraq, Iran, and Central Asia gathered; Damascus gathered pilgrims from the Levant and in later times Anatolia; and Cairo gathered the pilgrims from Egypt, Africa, the Maghreb, and al-Andalus (Spain).Sato, 2014, p. 134 The early Abbasids placed much value on the symbolic importance of the pilgrimage, and in the first century of Abbasid rule, it was members of the ruling dynasty who were usually chosen to lead the caravans. Furthermore, Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809) led the caravan in person several times. The specific year when the amir al-hajj office was established is not definitely known, but was likely in 978 CE when al-Aziz, the caliph of the Fatimids of Egypt, appointed Badis ibn Ziri to the position. The first amir al-hajj for the Kufa caravan was likely the Seljuk emir Qaymaz, appointed by Seljuk sultan Muhammad II in 1157, and the first likely amir al- hajj for the Damascus caravan was Tughtakin ibn Ayyub, appointed by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin after the reconquest of Jerusalem from the Crusaders in 1187. With the virtual destruction of the Abbasid Caliphate and its capital Baghdad by the Mongol Empire in 1258, the role of Damascus and Cairo as gathering and departure points for the Hajj caravan was elevated. The Mamluk Sultanate was established two years later. From then on, Damascus served as the main gathering point for pilgrims from the Levant, Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Persia, while Cairo was the marshalling point for pilgrims coming from the Nile Valley, North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa.Peters, 1994, p. 164 According to historian Jane Hathaway, it was under the Mamluks that the amir al-hajj assumed its \\"classical\\" form. Despite its importance, however, the Mamluks chose middle-ranking officials to lead the caravans—typically an amir mia muqaddam alf (commander of a thousand soldiers)Philipp, 1998, pp. 102-104—occasionally including freeborn Mamluks (awlād al-nās), who were considered of lower status than manumitted Mamluks. During the Mamluk era, the main pilgrimage caravan left from Cairo. Its amir al-hajj was always appointed by the sultan. The amir al-hajj of Damascus was either appointed by the sultan or his viceroy in Syria. The Damascene commander was generally subordinate to the Cairene commander, normally playing a neutral or supportive role to the latter in meetings or quarrels with the Meccan sharifs or the caravan commanders from Iraq or Yemen.Dunn, 1986, p. 66 Because the kiswa, the ceremonial covering for the Ka'aba, was usually woven in Egypt, it was carried by the Cairo caravan, while the Damascene caravan carried the corresponding covering for Muhammad's tomb in Medina. A few Mamluk sultans made the pilgrimage themselves, but usually their symbolic presence was represented by a palanquin (maḥmal), escorted by musicians. Ottoman era The kiswah being transported from Cairo to Mecca surrounded by an Egyptian armed guard, 1911 The role of amir al-hajj was continued by the Ottoman Empire when they gained control over the Mamluks' territories in 1517. Besides the latter year, during which the Ottoman sultan appointed a bureaucrat to the post, the umara' al-hajj from Cairo for much of the 16th century continued to come from the ranks of Circassian Mamluks with occasional appointments of important Arab sheikhs or high-ranking Bosnian or Turkish officials. This was followed by a period where commanders for the Cairene caravan came from Constantinople until the early 18th century when the Mamluks of Egypt once again became the favored appointees for the office.Peters, 1994, p. 167 In the 16th century, the amir al-hajj assigned to the caravan from Damascus commanded 100 sipahi, professional troops who owned fiefs in Damascus Eyalet (Province of Damascus), and janissaries, soldiers from the Damascus garrison. The first amir al-hajj for Damascus was the province's former Mamluk viceroy-turned Ottoman governor, Janbirdi al-Ghazali. Until 1571, the umara' al-hajj for Damascus were nominated from the high-ranking mamluks of Damascus, but afterward, mamluks and local leaders from lesser cities and towns such as Gaza, Ajlun, Nablus and al-Karak led the caravan with general success.Peters, 1994, p. 148 In 1708, the Ottoman imperial government adopted a new policy whereby the wali (governor) of Damascus would serve as the amir al-hajj.Burns, 2005, pp. 237–238. With this change in policy also came an elevation of the Damascene commander's rank. From then on, his rank was superior to that of the Cairene commander, any imperial Ottoman official traveling with the caravan, the Ottoman governor of the Hejaz in Jeddah, and the Meccan sharifs. The Arab al- Azm family of Damascus were able to hold on as governors of Damascus for lengthy periods partly due to their success commanding the caravan.Masters, ed. Agoston, 2009, p. 40 When the Wahhabis first took control of the Hejaz in the early 19th century, they prohibited the carrying of the maḥmal and the musicians, but when Muhammad Ali recovered the area in 1811, they were reinstated. When the Saudis recaptured the Hejaz in 1925, the ban was re- applied. The exclusivity of the amir al-hajj office enjoyed by the governors of Damascus ended sometime in the mid-19th century when the Ottomans regained control of Syria from Muhammad Ali's Egyptian forces. The security threat from Bedouin raiders also decreased during that time. From then on, amir al-hajj became an honorary office typically occupied by a Damascene notable. When the Ottomans lost their nominal authority over Egypt in 1911, the Sultan of Egypt assigned an amir al-hajj by decree on a yearly basis, although by then the importance of the office had receded significantly amid radical political changes occurring in the country. The defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in World War I signalled an end to the Damascene amir al-hajj.

In 1795 the Royal Navy captured her and took her into service under her existing name. HMS Suffisante captured seven privateers during her career, as well as recapturing some British merchantmen and capturing a number of prizes, some of them valuable. She was lost in December 1803 when she grounded in poor weather in Cork harbour. French service Suffisante was built with copper sheathing, including the pegs. By 30 November 1793 Suffisante was under the command of enseigne de vaisseau non entretenu Berrenger and stationed at Le Havre. From there she cruised to protect the fishermen working between Dieppe and Cap d'Antifer.Fonds Marine, p.66. Between 9 February 1794 and 3 August now sous-lieutenant de vaisseau Berrenger sailed Suffisante on cruises, escorted convoys between Dieppe and Cancale, sailed into the Atlantic, returning to Rochefort, and then sailed from Rochefort to Brest.Fonds Marine, p.107. Between 27 April 1795 and her capture, Suffisante was stationed at Flessingue and under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Nosten.Fonds Marine, p.116. Capture On 25 August 1795 the squadron under Admiral Adam Duncan captured two French Navy brigs off the Texel. One was Suffisante, of fourteen 8 and 6-pounder guns, and the other was , of fourteen 12-pounder guns. They were heading into the North Sea on a cruise. French records state that Suffisantes actual captors were the 74-gun third-rate , the frigate , and the lugger Speedy. The French reports further state that Suffisante exchanged fire with the 20-gun lugger Speedy, but the arrival on the scene of Mars and Venus rendered further resistance futile.Troude (1867), Vol. 2, p.455. Victorieuses captain was lieutenant de vaisseau Salaun. The captors of Victorieuse were Duncan's flagship , Mars, and a frigate. Victorieuse too joined the Royal Navy, becoming HMS Victorieuse and serving until broken up in 1805. Courts martial acquitted both Nosten and Salaun of the loss of their vessels. British service The Royal Navy commissioned HMS Suffisante for the North Sea in November under Commander Nicholas Tomlinson, who had been promoted commander into her. On 25 May 1796 Suffisante achieved the first of many captures. After a chase of eleven hours and a half-hour engagement, she captured the privateer brig Revanche in a single-ship action.Demerliac, p. 315, no2989 The Bermuda-built Revanche was armed with twelve 4-pounder guns, and had a crew of 85 men under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau George Henri Dravemen. She had lost two men killed and seven wounded; Suffisante had only one man wounded. Revanche was five days out of Le Havre but had taken nothing. The capture required able seamanship as it took place among the rocks on the lee shore between Ushant and The Main. In April she captured the American brig Maggy. This may have been an American vessel with contraband on board.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 25, pp.89–123. Next, on 9 June Suffisante captured the privateer Patriote, a 12-ton ship with 12 men, Dupont, master.Demerliac, p.243, no2058 On 25 June Suffisante captured the Danish brig Christian Severin, J. C. Lund, master. On 22 August Suffisante captured two vessels, Lucia, Boey Boeyson, master, and the dogger Jonge Pieter, Albert Jochems, master. On 27 August Suffisante intercepted and recaptured two British merchant ships near the Île de Batz. They reported that they had been sailing from Oporto when a privateer of 16 guns and 10 swivel guns had captured them. When last seen the privateer had been north of Scilly in chase of some other merchant vessels. Tomlinson immediately sent the recaptured vessels to Plymouth and sailed Suffisante to the French coast between Ushant and the Île de Batz in the hopes of intercepting the privateer on her return, or any prizes that she might have taken on their way to Morlaix or Brest. The next morning Tomlinson sighted the privateer and four prizes. He was able to capture the privateer by 1pm; Suffisante fired some small-arms fire at her and she did not fire back, but instead struck. Tomlinson then put a prize crew on board the privateer, after taking off her captain and officers, and captor and ex-privateer set off after the prizes. The privateer turned out to be Morgan, a 210-ton brig, previously captured from the British in March 1796, with 100 men and 10 guns.Demerliac, p. 250, no2144 Suffisante recaptured not only the four prizes she had seen, but two others as well. The six merchant vessels were: * Draper, 200 tons (bm), of Dublin, sailing from Oporto to Dublin, carrying 400 pipes of wire and 11 bales of cotton (Drapers master was Maddock,Lloyd's List n°2833 - accessed 19 November 2015. or Maddox); * Brothers, 180 tons (bm), of Liverpool, sailing from Oporto to Liverpool, carrying 350 pipes and 30 hogsheads of wine and 72 bales of cotton;One pipe of wine was equivalent to two hogsheads, each of 63 gallons. * Mary Ann, 70 tons (bm), of Dublin, sailing from Oporto to Dublin, carrying 272 pipes of wine, 11 bales of cotton, and five casks of vinegar; * Ann, 170 tons (bm), of Dublin, sailing from Oporto to Dublin, carrying 303 pipes of wine, 15 boxes and 10 baskets of lemons; * Vine, 110 tons (bm), of Lancaster, sailing from Oporto to Lancaster, carrying 108 pipes and four hogsheads of wine, 175 bags cotton, and three-and-a-half tons of cork, lemons, etc.; and * Eliza, 160 tons (bm), of Dublin, sailing from London to Dublin, carrying 250 chests of tea, 250 barrels of porter, a quantity of steel, and other dry goods. At the time these captures were considered highly important. The Committee for Encouraging the Capture of French Privateers etc. and the Court of Directors of the Royal Exchange Assurance, each voted Tomlinson a piece of plate valued at 50 guineas. At some point while Tomlinson was captain of Suffisante she captured the brig Bernon, and was involved in some capacity with the Spanish brigs San Joseph y Animas and San Rogue for which she \\"received money out of the registry of the High Court of Admiralty by virtue of His Majesty's warrant\\". Tomlinson received promotion to post captain on 12 December 1796,Marshall (1824) Vol. 2, Part 1, pp.430–38. whereupon Commander Josiah Wittman replaced him. On 22 March 1797 Wittman and Suffisante set out to cruise off the Start. The next day they chased an armed brig to eastward of Peveral Point before she out-distanced them. As Suffisante was heading back to the west she encountered and captured the small French privateer cutter Bonaparte (or Buonapartie). Bonaparte was armed with 14 guns and was three days out of Saint-Malo without having captured anything. A month or so later, on 21 April, Suffisante chased and captured Petite Hélène,Demerliac, p. 318, no3035 (or Petit Helena), a French privateer lugger of two guns and 33 men. She belonged to Brest, but was last from Île de Batz and had not taken anything. Suffisante brought her into Plymouth. On 20 May 1799 Suffisante and were in sight when captured the ship Johanna Maria, Kroyer, master. The French privateer Providence, captured the Guernsey brig May on 3 December 1799, but Suffisante recaptured May off the Île de Batz. Suffisante then set off after Providence; however, there is no record indicating that Suffisante was successful in her quest. Next, Suffisante recaptured Giraldina, May, master, of Guernsey, and carrying a cargo of wines, that a French privateer had captured and that arrived at Plymouth on 19 December.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 2, p.640. On 29 January 1800, Suffisante and Havick were in the Channel together when Suffisante signaled to Havick to chase north. There Havick observed a ship, a cutter, and a lugger fleeing to the southeast. Havick captured the ship, which was the American vessel Strafford, of 16 guns and carrying a cargo of tobacco from Baltimore to London; she had been a prize to the two fleeing vessels, and Captain Bartholomew of Havick believed that her cargo was worth £30–40,000. Suffisante captured the lugger Courageux and the cutter Grand Quinola. Courageux was armed with four 4-pounder guns and one 18-pounder carronade, and had a crew of 42 men. Grand Quinnola was armed with 8-pounder brass carronades, two 2-pounder brass guns, two 2-pounder iron guns, and swivel guns; she had a crew of 47 men. The two privateers had left Saint-Malo together three days earlier. Havick and Suffisante shared the prize money with and the hired armed brig . Suffisante captured the privateer Joséphine (or Josephina), on 13 March. Joséphine, of four guns and 20 men, was under the command of John Francis Froment. She was two days out of Morlaix and had taken nothing. Joséphine sank after her capture. On 25 March the Danish brig Maria, came into Plymouth. She had been sailing from Morlaix for Corunna, with linen and paper when Suffisante detained and sent her in.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.326. In May Suffisante (\\"Sufficiante\\") detained three Dutch vessels: Anna Maria, Jusfrow Anna Catherina, and Seeks Geswisters. On 3 September Suffisante and Havick encountered a French flotilla of 14 vessels carrying provisions and stores to the French fleet at Brest, and under the escort of the 18-gun fluyt (or corvette en flute) , under Captain Conseil, and the gunboat Protectrice, under Guégun. The British engaged the French and drove them under the protection of shore batteries at Locquirec, near Morlaix. Fire from the batteries killed two men on Havick, and wounded two.Naval Chronicle, vol. 4, p.250.London Chronicle, (6–9 September 1800), p. 248.Troude, vol.3, p. 217 Harriet, Atkins, master, of Boston, from Isle de France via Boston, arrived at Plymouth on 23 July. She was carrying a valuable cargo for Rotterdam when Suffisante detained her.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.161. On 12 September Suffisante came into Plymouth with a Danish galliot that had been sailing from Bordeaux to Embden with wines and brandies.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.251. Suffisante, , , and the cutter Swift shared in the recapture on 13 December 1800 of the Defiance. Defiance had been sailing from Penzance to London when she was captured.Lloyd's List, n° 4112. Another prize money notice gave the name of Suffisantes captain at the recapture as Jonas Rose. If not a reporting error, Rose may have been temporary while Wittman was on leave. On 18 January 1801, Duke of Kent, of Dartmouth, came into Plymouth. She had been returning from Newfoundland with a cargo of fish and cod oil when a French privateer had captured her. Suffisante recaptured Duke of York as she was going into Brest.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.94. Then on 4 February the Mont Blanc, a prize to Suffisante, came into Plymouth.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.179. Suffisante and Spitfire shared the proceeds of the recapture of the brig Honduras Packet. Honduras Packet (or Honduras Planter), of eight guns and 16 men under the command of Captain J. Goodwin, had been sailing from London to New Providence. A French privateer, of fourteen guns and 125 men, captured her after an action of one hour and a quarter. Spitfire recaptured Honduras Packet on 18 February 1801 off Abervrac and she arrived at Plymouth four days later. Spitfire arrived the next day.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.271. On 25 February Suffisante went into Barnpool to refit.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.272. During 20 to 21 March a hurricane blew in the Channel. Even so, Suffisante, Spitfire, and Renard arrived safely in Jersey.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.276. Suffisante shared with and Renard, in the recapture on 3 April 1801, of the brig Swan. Suffisante also shared in the recapture around that same day of the William. William was a Newfoundland brig under the command of Wadland, master, that the French privateer Renard had captured. A boat from had cut her out from under the guns of battery at Île de Batz.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, pp.369–70. At some point while Wittman was still her captain, Suffisante captured Maria Elizabeth, Anna Maria, and Seeks Ges Wisten. On 13 April 1801 Christopher John William Nesham was promoted to commander and captain of Suffisante, replacing Wittman, whose ill-health prevented him from continuing in command of Suffisante.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 8, p.82. On 19 July Suffisante left Plymouth as escort to a convoy carrying livestock and vegetables to the Royal Navy squadron off Le Havre.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.81. One month later, on 19 August, the cartel Betsey came into Plymouth with wounded men from Suffisante. A cutting out party from Suffisante had attempted to take an armed cutter in Morlaix roads when a Danish brig had given the alarm. Heavy fire ensued that forced the party to return to Suffisante with casualties.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.168. Betsey had sailed from Plymouth on 15 July with French prisoners that she was to deliver to Morlaix. On 17 September a Danish vessel came into Plymouth. She had been sailing from Stralsund to Bordeaux when Suffisante had detained her. Four days laterGustavus Vasa, of Stockholm, arrived. She had been sailing from \\"Underwold\\" to Bordeaux when Suffisante had detained her.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.255. In early January 1802 gales of wind had caused Suffisante to ship several heavy seas, nearly swamping her. One seaman was washed overboard and Nesham had been knocked down, but was unhurt. She had been obliged to batten down for 48 hours, with the result for that entire period the officers and crew had remained on the main and quarter-deck.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 7, p.177. On 17 April Suffisante was back at Plymouth. She had carried discharged Irish seamen to Cork, landed them, and returned to Plymouth, all in three days and 14 hours. She then left for Dublin with another batch of discharged Irish seamen.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 7, p.446. On 29 April 1802 Nesham was advanced to post captain. That same day, Gilbert Heathcote received a promotion to commander. He would later replace Nesham. On 16 May Suffisante, still under Nesham's command, escorted into Plymouth Old Chatham, of 50 guns, from Falmouth. There she had served as a receiving and convalescent ship. She was in such poor condition that Suffisante was assigned to escort her for safety's sake. Old Chatham was sent up to Hamoaze to be paid off and broken up.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 7, p.448. was not then broken up; apparently she was a powder hulk at Plymouth in 1805, was renamed HMS Tilbury in 1810, and was broken up in 1814. On 3 July Nexham sailed Suffisante into the Hamoaze where she was to be laid up in ordinary. still, that month she may have undergone refitting while under the command of Commander A.R. Kerr.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 12, Appendix, (p.170). After the resumption of hostilities between Britain and France in 1803, Suffisante was commissioned in July, under Gilbert Heathcote. She then underwent refitting at Plymouth. On 30 October she captured Navigation, which came into Plymouth on 17 November. Navigation was a Dutch East Indiaman, sailing from Batavia to Amsterdam. She was said to be worth £16,000, and the richest ship yet captured from that settlement.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 10, p.512. Fate One report states that she wrecked on 25 December 1803 in a violent gale off Spike Island, Queenstown, Cork. Seven of the crew drowned, and a falling mast killed another three.Toone (1828), Vol. 2, p.516. However, the court martial of Heathcote, his officers, and his crew, told a different story. On 25 December Suffisante was in Cork harbour, waiting for wind and weather to change to permit her to sail. A local pilot came aboard and he moved her closer inshore. Heathcote permitted the pilot to leave; the pilot was to return the next day and take her out. Heathcote then went below. At 5pm Suffisante hit ground, increasingly strongly. The crew fired distress guns and boats from nearby vessels came, but the choppy seas prevented cables or anchors from being let out. The pumps were managing to keep the water that was entering from rising until sand clogged them. Water began rising rapidly and the crew was barely able to get the sloop's cutter overboard before she fell on her beam ends and sank.Hepper (1994), p.103. Although the officers blamed the pilot for having left Suffisante in a poorly- chosen location, the officers had mishandled the situation. Lieutenant John Forbes should have taken the watch, but remained below, leaving a midshipman in charge. The master, John Coleman, had gone below for his dinner and left the pilot in charge of the positioning; Coleman stated that he was unaware that the pilot had gone ashore. Heathcote was below dining with his officers and unaware of the developing situation. The court martial found him partly to blame for the loss and reprimanded him but did not punish him. It also reprimanded Coleman, and sentenced Forbes to the loss of one year's seniority.  Legacy  The plans of Suffisante, as reconstituted by the British, are available at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwitch.

A promotional single of \\"Will to Love\\" was released, backed with a live performance of \\"Cortez the Killer.\\" Background \\"Will to Love\\" had been intended for Young's unreleased Chrome Dreams album. He recorded the song alone in a single take on a two-track cassette tape, sitting in front of a fireplace playing acoustic guitar. He used a fader and applied stereo vibrato to achieve a fish sound. He also overdubbed percussion, bass and vibraphone himself. He claims to have mixed the song the same night he recorded it and it was completed in about 8 hours. Young claims to have never sung the song again after the initial recording. He has stated that he is unable to sing it again since he can't remember the melody, since all the verses came out differently. But according to music journalist Nigel Williamson, Young did rehearse the song for Long May You Run, his 1976 collaboration with Stephen Stills, but gave up on re-recording it because he felt it wasn't coming out right. According to Theodore Gracyk, \\"Will to Love\\" would have been included on a Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album had the quartet been able to match the power of Young's solo recording. Lyrics and music The singer of \\"Will to Love\\" imagines himself to be a salmon swimming upstream to mate and struggling to survive. He sings that \\"I'm a harpoon dodger/I can't, won't be tamed.\\" Village Voice critic Robert Christgau says that Young \\"turns into a salmon while masturbating in front of the fireplace.\\" Author Ken Bielen describes the theme of \\"Will to Love\\" as being the instinct to love and reproduce. Author David Downing describes the theme as being the hopelessness but necessity of the search for God and love. Neil Young biographer Jimmy McDonough says that the \\"preposterous persona\\" of the salmon allows Young to \\"expound on the complex yearnings of love\\" and reveal \\"some naked truths about his cold wanderlust self.\\" The salmon in the song determined to reach the spawning place has been interpreted as a metaphor for the desire and loneliness associated with the \\"will to love,\\" or for Young's own desires and dreams. The fish with its will to love suggests that love is mysterious and spiritual with lines such as \\"It's like something from up above.\\" Neil Young FAQ author Glen Boyd describes \\"Will to Love\\" as having a \\"dreamy, atmospheric quality\\" which enhances the lyrics. He compares the \\"haunting\\" and \\"detached\\" sound of the song to such new-age music as that of Brian Eno and Tangerine Dream. McDonough points out that Young's vocal performance manages to encompass several contradictions simultaneously, such as being both worldly and \\"completely, terrifyingly alone,\\" both reluctant and willing, and both empty but fulfilled. At times the crackling from the fireplace can be heard in the song's background. Reception \\"Will to Love\\" has drawn sharp disagreement among critics. For example, even among critics of one publication, Rolling Stone, critic Dave Marsh called \\"Will to Love\\" one \\"of the worst songs of Young's career.\\" But later Rob Sheffield called it merely a \\"home-recording oddity.\\" And in 2014, the editors of Rolling Stone ranked \\"Will to Love\\" #68 among all Neil Young's songs. Young himself said of \\"Will to Love\\" that it \\"might be one of the best records I ever made.\\" Young biographer Jimmy McDonough called it \\"one of Young's most otherworldly performances\\" and a \\"highlight\\" of American Stars 'N Bars. Author Ken Bielen calls it \\"a long, wordy track with an ethereal feel.\\" Neil Young FAQ author Glen Boyd calls it one \\"of Young's all-time greatest songs,\\" and one of his most beautiful and unique. Boyd also calls it \\"an absolutely masterful piece of songwriting\\" and states that Young only matches the \\"vivid lyrical imagery\\" of \\"Will to Love\\" in some of his American Indian songs such as \\"Pocahontas.\\" Neil Young biographers Daniel Durchholz and Gary Graff call \\"Will to Love\\" \\"one of Young's most extraordinary works, if only for the way it was recorded.\\" Others who take a negative view of the song include music journalist Nigel Williamson, who disputed Young's assessment, calling the song \\"deeply unconvincing\\" and having a \\"laborious lyric.\\" Author Sam Inglis calls it \\"a bizarrely awful seven-minute epic\\" developing \\"the whimsical image of [Young] as a leaping salmon.\\" Music critic Johnny Rogan takes a somewhat more balanced view, calling the salmon metaphor \\"painfully extended\\" and concluding that \\"the convoluted imagery is both frustrating and fascinating as [Young] seriously overreaches himself.\\" References 1977 songs Neil Young songs Songs written by Neil Young Song recordings produced by David Briggs (record producer) Songs about fish Song recordings produced by Neil Young ","title":"Will to Love"},{"id":"47140275","text":"Găunoasa River may refer to: * Găunoasa, a tributary of the Bistrița in Gorj County * Găunoasa, a tributary of the Holbav in Brașov County  See also  * Găunoșița River ","title":"Găunoasa River"},{"id":"47140316","text":"Ryan John Kelly is a Northern Irish singer known for being a part of the group Celtic Thunder.

London dials were originally engraved by scientific instrument makers. The trade was heavily protected by the system of craft guilds. A horizontal dial A gnomon or style is set to point at the celestial north pole, the shadow of the sun is thrown onto the dial plate and will appear at the same position each day of the year, and this position can be calculated using trigonometry, or drawn using geometric construction. In the world of sundials some of the technical terms use an old form of language, so the angle to which the style is set is called the style height. The style height is identical to the geographical latitude, and in London this was 51 degrees 30 minutes or 51.50 degrees, which roughly corresponds with Westminster Bridge. The gnomon has thickness, and thus two shadow throwing edges (the styles) one for the morning and one for the afternoon, there is a gap left on the dialplate the width of the gnomon. A sundial displays the local apparent time, and watches that use mean time or average time will always be at a slight variance. This difference of time can be calculated and displayed on the dial – again using old language it is known as the equation of time. A London dials show hour lines, some show half-hour markers, the quarter hours and some divisions representing half-quarters (7 and a half minutes). The equation of time is shown as a three rings, showing the words WATCH SLOWER, WATCH FASTER, the months and dates and the minutes of time of variance. Geometrical construction There are many methods to do this: the one published by Leybourn in 1652 is still popular. Leybourn, Art of Dialing (1652, 1669) Though the one by Dom Francois Bedos de Celles in 1790 is more widely known. The Whitehurst & Sons London dial in Derby set for Belper 53.03 N. It has all the features of a London engraved dial Calculations ;Style height ::SH=phi ;Hour lines (mark from 4am to 8pm) :: tan H_H = sin phi tan(15^{circ} times t) ::where H_H is the angle from noon line, and ::phi is the geographical latitude. Definitions ;Centre of delineation: the point where the styles and all the hour lines meet. On a dials with a thick gnomon, there will be two centres of delineation, separated by a noon gap. ;Gnomon: the vertical triangular component. The gnomon is precisely angled for the latitude, in London that is nominally 51° 30' N. The London gnomon has thickness so the style that casts the shadow for the morning hours is the western edge of the gnomon while the eastern edge of the gnomon is the style that cast the shadow for the afternoon hours. ;Chapter ring: this is the ring of written numbers. On the chapter ring may be half-hour indicators and quarter-hour indicators. Timeline ;1500s :Written evidence of dials (Reign Henry VII) ;1542 :Nicholas Oursian- this is the earliest example in a museum. It is dated with inwardly facing roman numerals. The origin or centre of delineation is the centre of the dialplale. It has simple decoration, a large Tudor Rose beneath the style. ;1578 :A dial (maker unknown) for Sir Philip Sidney (1554-1586). Decoration included a ropework border, and scrolls at the end of the chapter ring. ;1580s :Simple punched dials- for use by the less wealthy, though the gnomon started to have a complex shape. ;1590 :Isaack Symmes, a 'gouldsmith'(sic) was producing dials. The centre of delineation moved to the southern edge of the dial, the division now included hours, half- hours and quarter hours. The lettering could be gushing, reflecting the developments in calligraphy and silverwork. Some Symmes dials included a volvelle. ;Jacobean ;1588-1653 :Elias Allen, the mathematical instrument maker. These were accurate with austere decoration. ;1665 :Henry Sutton (1649-1665), a renowned engraver of scientific instruments, was a victim of the plague. ;1660 :Regime change The restored aristocracy restored their houses and decorated their gardens. Decorative sundials were in demand. ;1680s :Henry Wynne ;1680 :Flamsteed's Equation of Time Tables were available. Diallists experimented on how the information should be included on the dial. Thomas Tompion used calendar tables, Wynne preferred linear strip tables. The tables were then drawn as concentric arcs around the compass rose. The early arcs were labelled as Equation of Natural Days- later they included the text Watch Fast. This chapter ring was separated from the compass rose by a decorative ring of oak-leaves. ;1700 :Wynne retired and his workshop was passed to Thomas Wright- Thomas Tuttell and Richard Glynne ;1700s :John Rowley made the hour numbers face outwards, this was adopted by all London diallists and by 1750 in all of the provinces. ;1700s :The change of orientation of the Equation of Natural Days came in two stages, firstly a simple reversal that led to the months running backward, then secondly the months were reversed to run left to right, ie counterclockwise. ;1750 :Mathematical instrument makers moved to a factory system, with workshops of journeymen just doing a small part of the dial. Thomas Heath had a large workshop. Dials were no longer signed by one man. The name was that of the manufactory or even the retailer. Decorations came from a pattern book, these would be scrolls on the Equation of Time ring, coats of arm and cartouches for signatures. ;1800 :Simplification of design. The oakleaf decoration was replaced by a zigzag design. Troughton & Simms was one of the last of the mathematical instrument makers who made dials. ;1850s :The need for accurate dials decreased as time was transmitted electrically. Francis Barker and Son issued a catalogue of decorative designs. ;1880s :Machine (pantograph) engraving started. The Watch Faster/Slower ring was removed being replaced by a simple table then after 1920 a graph. ;1900s :Emergence of fake dials, with mottoes and Father Time figures suns and other symbols. These had a false date and spurious makers names: these were sold by companies such as Pearson Page Ltd or Peerless Brass to meet customer demand. Geometrical markup technique A horizontal dial, takes the equiangular hour lines of a equatorial dial and projects them onto an plane oblique to the style, the markup simulates this transformation. The Dom Francois Bedos de Celles method (1760) otherwise known as the Waugh method (1973) *Take a large sheet of paper. *Starting at the bottom, draw a line across, and a vertical one up the centre. Where they cross is important call it O. *Choose the size of the dial, and draw a line across. Where it crosses the centre line is important call it F *You know your latitude. Draw a line upwards from O at this angle, this is a construction line. *Using a square, (drop a line) draw a line from F through the construction line so they cross at right angles. Call that point E, it is important. To be precise it is the line FE that is important as it is length sinphi . *Using compasses, or dividers the length FE is copied upwards in the centre line from F. The new point is called G and yes it is important- the construction lines and FE can now be erased. *From G a series of lines, 15° apart are drawn, long enough so they cross the line through F. These mark the hour points 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3 if you take just 3 and represent the points tan h sinphi . *The centre of the dial is at the bottom, point O. The line drawn from each of these hour point to O will be the hour line on the finished dial. *If the paper is large enough, the method above works from 7 until 12, and 12 until 5 and the values before and after 6 are calculated through symmetry. However, there is another way of marking up 7 and 8, and 4 and 5. Call the point where 3 crosses the line R, and a drop a line at right-angles to the base line. Call that point W. Use a construction line to join W and F. Waugh calls the crossing points with the hours lines K, L, M. *Using compasses or dividers, add two more points to this line N and P, so that the distances MN = ML, and MP = MK. The missing hour lines are drawn from O through N and through P. The construction lines are erased. File:Bedos de Celles method (1790)-(1).svgSetting out a dial for 52°N. The three initial lines.

Biography Amy Conroy was born on 22 October 1992. When she was young, she was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a common bone cancer that runs in her family. Chemotherapy failed to arrest the cancer and she had to have her left leg amputated. Conroy tried wheelchair basketball and found that she enjoyed the speed and aggression of the sport. A 4.0 point player, she made her international debut as a teenager at the 2010 BT Paralympic World Cup. Later that year she participated in the 2010 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship in Birmingham, where Team Great Britain came sixth, its best ever placing. In 2011 they won gold at the BT Paralympic World Cup and bronze at the European Championship. Conroy made her Paralympic debut at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, where she was Team Great Britain's top-scorer in their opening match against the Netherlands. She was top-scorer again with 22 points in the final match again Mexico, where Great Britain secured seventh place, its highest ranking at the Paralympics since the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta. In 2013, Conroy was part of the team that won bronze at the European Championship, and silver at the U25 European Championships. The team was placed fifth at the 2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship in Toronto. In 2015, she won silver in the Osaka Cup in Japan in February, and was co-captain (with Laurie Williams) of the U25 team at the 2015 Women's U25 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship in Beijing, winning gold. The senior team then defeated France to take bronze in the 2015 European Championship. In May 2016, she was named as part of the team for the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro. The British team produced its best ever performance at the Paralympics, making it all the way to the semi-finals, but lost to the semi- final to the United States, and then the bronze medal match to the Netherlands.

Healy, served New York County from 1913 to 1918 Dr. George F. Shrady, Jr. served as Coroner of New York County in 1906. The Coroner of New York City issued death certificates and performed autopsies and inquests for New York County, New York for all homicides, suicides and accidental deaths and any suspicious deaths. The office served only Manhattan until 1891 when the city expanded. After the 1891 consolidation of New York City the office handled the outer boroughs, with each outer borough having two coroners. Coroners were elected at the same time as the Mayor of New York City for a term of four years and there was no requirement that the candidate had to be a physician. They could be removed from office by the Governor of New York. If a coroner died in office, or was fired, or quits, someone was appointed to fill out their term. The coroners received a salary and also billed the city for services rendered for each autopsy and inquest. By 1896 the Manhattan coroner was earning $6,000 per year, and in 1897 each inquest was billed at $8.50. In 1915 a law was passed to abolished the office on January 1, 1918. It was replaced with the Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York. The medical examiner was to be a physician and no longer had the ability to hold inquests, which became the responsibility of the district attorney. Between 1898 when the city was consolidated and 1915 when the office went from coroner to medical examiner, 65 coroners had served in the position. Of them, nineteen were physicians, eight were undertakers, seven were politicians, six were real estate agents, two were saloon keepers, two were plumbers, one was a musician, one was a dentist, and one was a butcher. Laws The New York statute of 1847 describes the Coroner's duties: > Whenever any coroner shall receive notice that any person has been slain, or > has suddenly died, or has been dangerously wounded, or has been found dead > under such circumstances as to require an inquisition, it shall be the duty > of such Coroner to go to the place where such person shall be, and forthwith > to summon a jury. The laws covering deaths in New York City in 1865 was as follows: > The machinery of the law of New-York City about Coroners' inquests is > arranged to take advantage of the insular situation of New-York. That is: > First, it prohibits interments within the city, except in certain specified > cases. Second, it prohibits anyone from conveying out of the city the body > of anyone who has died within it, except under a permit from the City > Inspector. Third, it directs the Inspector to grant such permit on receipt > of a proper certificate, either from the Coroner or from the physician who > attended the deceased; or if there was none, from some one of the family. > Fourth, it specifies that the physician who makes such a certificate shall, > among other things, specify 'the direct and indirect cause of the death of > such person;' and that if the Coroner holds an inquest, he shall do the same > in his certificate. The Government of the City of New York official guide written by the New York City Commissioner of Accounts in 1917 describes the office as follows: > There are eleven Coroners in the City of New York — four for the Borough of > Manhattan, two for The Bronx, two for Brooklyn, two for Queens and one for > Richmond. The Coroners in each borough, except Richmond, constitute a Board > of Coroners for the borough. Coroners are elected at the same time as the > Mayor for a term of four years. They may be removed on charges by the > Governor. The Coroner has jurisdiction over all homicide, suicide and > accidental death cases and over all suspicious deaths, deaths in prison, and > cases where the deceased was unattended by a physician. In cases of serious > wounding the Coroner has jurisdiction to take an ante-mortem statement. The > functions of the Coroner are threefold — medical investigation to determine > the scientific cause of death, legal investigation to determine who caused > the death, and judicial power to sit as a magistrate in homicide cases. The > law requires the Coroner to summon a jury in cases where there is reasonable > ground to believe that a homicide has been committed, and he may order the > arrest of suspected persons. Each Coroner has a coroner's physician to > assist him in medical investigations. He may subpoena witnesses and has > power to order an autopsy and issues death certificates, upon which the > Health Department grants burial permits. A law passed in 1915 provides for > the abolishment of the office of Coroner on January 1, 1918, and the > substitution of a Chief Medical Examiner for the entire city, with assistant > medical examiners. The work of legal investigation is to be assumed by the > District Attorneys, and the coroner's judicial function is to be performed > by the City Magistrates. History Originally New York City had two elected coroners. Each coroner was assigned a physician and a clerk. In 1852 the number of coroners were doubled to four. In 1896 Theodore Knapp Tuthill suggested doubling the number of New York County, New York coroners from four to eight, and increasing the compensation for the coroners to attract more competent officials. In 1898 New York City expanded from Manhattan to include Queens, Staten Island, Brooklyn, and The Bronx. In 1903 senator Nathaniel A. Elsberg sought to abolish the office and set up a new one based on the medical examiner model used in Massachusetts. Each medical examiner would be appointed to a five-year term. The coroner would no longer have police power and judicial power. That role would be taken over by the New York County District Attorney and the Criminal Court of the City of New York.

The project was initially founded in 2000 with funds from the Archaeology Department of Monticello, the historical home and plantation of Thomas Jefferson and modern UNESCO World Heritage Site. The project’s goals include cultivating collaboration between scholars of multiple disciplines and the sharing and open access of American slavery-related archaeological data. In addition to organizing and conducting physical excavations of slavery-related archaeological sites throughout the Chesapeake region, the Carolinas, and the Caribbean, the project maintains a free, online, publicly available SQL database of detailed archaeological recordings from sites related to the slavery of Africans in North America and the Caribbean. The data are systematically recorded using a single set of classification and measurement protocols, enabling researchers to perform both cross-site and within-site analyses on available data.  3D laser scanned artifact images  In 2008, with funding from the US National Endowment for the Humanities and the UK Joint Information Systems Committee, the DAACS began a project to provide three-dimensional laser scans of Afro-Caribbean artifact sherds as part of its online dataset. 3D image files are created using a NextEngine 3D Scanner HD at a resolution of 40,000 points/in², using 3D digital scanning techniques established by the University of California, San Diego Levantine and Cyber-Archaeology Laboratory. Though the project is currently limited to Afro-Caribbean sherds from select sites, the DAACS has stated plans to expand the project to scanning ceramic and non-ceramic artifacts from sites throughout the Atlantic region. All 3D scan files (.obj) and constituent image files (.jpg) are publicly available for download as part of the open access DAACS database.

Biography George Marino was born on April 15, 1947 in the New York City borough of the Bronx. He attended Christopher Columbus High School there and learned to play the saxophone and bass fiddle in the high school band and was classically trained on guitar. Marino broke into the music business as a guitarist playing rock and roll in local New York City bands such as The Chancellors and The New Sounds Ltd. until most of the band members were drafted into the service for the war in Vietnam. In 1967, Marino landed his first job in the industry as a librarian and assistant at Capitol Studios. Soon after, he apprenticed in the mastering department alongside of Joe Lansky, cutting rock, pop, jazz and classical albums. There, in 1968, he met his future wife, Rose Gross, whom he married in 1973. Gross became Clive Davis' assistant in 1974, a few months before Davis started Arista Records and she remained Clive Davis' assistant for 26 years. The Chancellors (l-r) Bijan Yakuboff, Don Grassini, Ronnie Salvani, Nick DiMinno, George MarinoCapitol Studios letter regarding the mastering of 7\\" 45 RPM single of \\"Hey Jude\\" Professional career During his time at Capitol, Marino mastered such classics as The Beatles 7\\" single of \\"Hey Jude\\" and John Lennon & Plastic Ono Band's Live Peace in Toronto 1969. When Capitol Records closed its New York studio in 1971, Marino joined the fledgling Record Plant, eventually becoming a partner in the mastering business of the Record Plant called the Master Cutting Room, which was on West 44th Street in Manhattan. There he became established with projects such as Don McLean’s American Pie, Alice Cooper's Billion Dollar Babies, Gregg Allman's Laid Back, and Stevie Wonder's Talking Book and Innervisions. Lee Hulko, one of the owners of Sterling Sound, saw Marino's success and asked him to come work at Sterling, however Marino did not say yes immediately. After Chris Stone, the owner of the Record Plant went to LA, Marino had more management duties and he felt it distracted him from his mastering work. Eventually, Marino took Hulko up on his offer and he headed to Sterling Sound in 1973 to work in a room that Hulko had built for him.George and Rose Marino Sterling Sound From 1973, until his death in 2012, Marino worked at Sterling Sound. In 1998, Ted Jensen, Greg Calbi and Tom Coyne, along with Murat Aktar (Absolute Audio co-founder) and UK based Metropolis, purchased Sterling from previous owner, Lee Hulko. Marino was the most senior mastering engineer. Sterling Sound is located in New York City, occupying the top floor of the Chelsea Market in the Meatpacking District. Marino's studio is one of the three surround sound studios at Sterling and it was designed by Fran Manzella, FM Design. Marino's room became one of the few mastering suites in the industry, if not the only one, that was capable of doing both surround sound and vinyl mastering. Marino, along with Chris Muth and Sterling techs Barry Wolifson and Phil Sztenderowicz, turned Marino's mastering console into an 8 channel A/B preview console. This design made possible presetting console parameters from song to song, which is needed for the continuous process of cutting a side of a vinyl album. This type of design was common in mastering houses during vinyl's heyday, but what made this one different was the ability to also process 6 discrete channels for surround sound. Over the course of Marino's nearly 40 years with Sterling, he mastered and/or remastered albums by AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Guns N' Roses, Metallica, Cheap Trick, Arcade Fire, Whitney Houston, Coldplay; Cyndi Lauper; Journey; Kiss; Mötley Crüe; The Cars; Bon Jovi; Arctic Monkeys; Dan Fogelberg; Iron Maiden; Fountains of Wayne; Incubus; Joe Bonamassa; Jimi Hendrix; Joe Satriani; Michael Bublé; Weezer; Leonard Cohen, My Morning Jacket, The Tragically Hip, 3 Doors Down, Alice Cooper, Billy Squier, Cinderella, M-Squad, Sarah Brightman, The Psychedelic Furs, Tommy James and the Shondells, Bob Dylan, John Mellencamp, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ringo Starr, Santana, Josh Groban, Southside Johnny, Willie Nile, Elvis Presley, Fall Out Boy, Ozzy Osbourne, Blondie, Hanson, Jimmy Page and hundreds of others. George Marino mastered many of John Lennon's and Yoko Ono's albums, one of them being Double Fantasy with producer Jack Douglas. Double Fantasy had been out a few weeks when Douglas and Lennon decided to have a song they had just finished, Yoko Ono's \\"Walking on Thin Ice\\", mastered with Marino at Sterling Sound for a single release. On the evening of December 8, 1980, after finishing up a session at the Record Plant, Douglas said to Lennon \\"See you in the morning\\" as they planned to have breakfast together at 9am before heading to Sterling, but John Lennon was gunned down 20 minutes later on his way back to the Dakota.Early years at Sterling SoundMarino received his first and only Grammy for Arcade Fire's The Suburbs, the year before he died. In 2002, mastering engineers became eligible to win Grammys. From 1969 to 2012, Marino mastered albums which under current rules, would have won him an additional seven Grammys in the categories of Record of the Year, Album of the Year and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical: three for Album of the Year winners Innervisions, Double Fantasy and The Bodyguard, two Record of the Year Grammys for \\"I Will Always Love You\\" and \\"Clocks\\", and two more for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical for his mastering of Innervisions and Chicago 17.

Located at 3252 W. Victoria Street, the home was built in 1940 by architect Andrew Nicholas Rebori (1886-1966) and artist Edgar Miller (1899-1993) for Philip Weintraub. The house is built in the International Style with an asymmetric shape, smooth undecorated siding, and flat roofs with a rooftop terrace. Inside there are elements of Art Moderne including rounded edges on walls and the fireplace, recessed cove lighting, built-in cabinets, a glass-block wall in the bathroom, and a round window by the front entrance. Miller designed three art pieces for the interior: a low-relief sculpture of a woman over the fireplace, a recessed decorative tile of a woman on a beach, and a metal door-pull on a built-in hallway cabinet. These objects were still in the house in 2009, when it was declared a Chicago Landmark. The house was chosen as a Chicago Landmark for three reasons. First, it is an important part of the city's history as an example of a middle-class house designed in early pre-World War II modernism. Second, it is important architecture in that it combines elements of International Style and Art Moderne in a pre-World War II house, with artwork by an important Chicago artist. Third, the house represents the innovations in modern design of an important Chicago architect. Rebori designed many other significant Chicago buildings and Rebori collaborated with Miller on others. The Madonna della Strada Chapel at Loyola University and the Fischer Studio Houses are both examples of buildings the two worked on together. This house was the site of a Chicago \\"Fight or Walk\\" protest of Chicago Transit Authority rate hikes on April 9, 2005 when the home was the property of Frank Kruesi, then president of the Chicago CTA.

The Osseointegration Group of Australia Team is made up of specialists from various fields including prosthetics, physio, rehabilitation, anesthesia and psychology. Osseointegration surgery involves the insertion of a titanium implant into the femur or tibia of an amputee. The implant than connects with an external prosthetic component which eliminates the need for traditional rigid socket prosthetics. The surgery and the follow up from the team aims to provide patients with a greater quality of life through increased mobility and reduced discomfort. The group offers support before and after the surgery providing rehabilitation, physiotherapy and pain management.  Notable surgeries  The Osseointegration Group of Australia clinics at Norwest Private Hospital in Sydney are known worldwide as centres of excellence, according to NEWS. Dr Al Muderis and the Osseointegration Group of Australia have treated several Paralympian, cancer patients and traumatic amputees from both Australia and overseas.

Marny In a world first procedure, she became the first person in the world to be fitted with a bionic limb after lengthening her bone by two inches as the remaining stump after her amputation was too short for a prosthetic limb to be fitted. Her successful surgery set a precedent for possible achievements in the case of thousands other amputees. Jamie Bertoux, a double amputee from London, was the first overseas patient to travel to Australia to have osseointegration surgery under the care of the Osseointegration Group of Australia. Osseointegration patient Phil Coulson from Nelson in New Zealand became the first New Zealander to be fitted with a bionic leg.

Michael Swain was a British rifleman who was 20 years old when he lost his leg in the Taliban Bomb Blast in Afghanistan that took place in November 2009. For 18 months, he tried learning how to walk with prosthetic legs but he was still relatively immobile.

In practice, however, no dispute from Tokelau has ever been litigated outside Tokelau. There has been a strong community feeling that disputes are matters for the community and the community alone. This has meant that, to date, community thinking has been opposed to any thought of having a case decided in another village, let alone outside Tokelau.\\"United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: New Zealand draft periodic report 6\\", sections 210-213, New Zealand Ministry of Justice, 2015. Jurisdiction Village Councils Village Councils have civil and criminal jurisdiction for matters within their island and territorial sea and consist of a Commissioner and a Court Clerk. Councils may only hear civil claims up to $1000 and criminal cases punishable by a fine or imprisonment for a period of at most one year. Despite this, the maximum term of imprisonment which a Commissioner can impose is three months, and the maximum fine that can be imposed is $150. Other penalties which can be imposed include community service, reprimand, police supervision and compensation for loss of property.\\"Tokelau Courts System Information\\", University of the South Pacific, 2001. Appeal Committee The Appeal Committees of each island comprise a maximum of three members and have the jurisdiction to hear appeals of decisions made by the Village Councils. Higher courts Major criminal or civil matters, as well as appeals, can be dealt with by the High Court of New Zealand acting as the High Court of Tokelau, followed by the Court of Appeal of New Zealand, acting as the Court of Appeal of Tokelau. In addition, despite having been abolished in other Commonwealth nations such as Australia and New Zealand, the right of appeal to the Privy Council still theoretically exists for Tokelauan disputes.\\"Tokelau Judicial Annual Report 2012 - 2013\\", Office of the Council for the Ongoing Government of Tokelau. Practical operation Currently the judges of Tokelau are the Law Commissioners of each island. These are lay officers who perform their duties with the village councils in the context of the village structures and local tradition. In the fulfilment of their roles, Commissioners typically are informed more by custom than legislation, although, the Crimes, Procedure and Evidence Rules 2003 have, where possible, incorporated these customs. The Commissioners are concerned primarily with criminal offences of a minor nature and, in cooperation with the local police officers, deal with offenders by way of reprimand, sentences of community service or fines. There are no prisons in Tokelau, but when someone is sentenced to imprisonment for a minor crime, they are required to help police in their duties.\\"Death may be first Tokelau murder\\", Michael Field, Fairfax Media, 13 January 2013. Legal representation The requirement of the availability of defence counsel, at public cost if necessary, presents practical problems for a community of Tokelau’s type, given its small population and physical isolation. However, there is provision in Rule 94 of the Crimes, Procedure and Evidence Rules for the grant of legal aid, taking into account the means of the applicant and the nature of the case. Under Rule 95 of the Crimes, Procedure and Evidence Rules the prior written approval of the Council for Ongoing Government is required in order to be able to practise law in Tokelau or before a court of Tokelau. To date three New Zealand qualified lawyers have been admitted to practice in the courts of Tokelau. Two of those are in the Government service and one in the private sector. Civil cases and appeals There is no fee for filing civil cases in Tokelau, however such cases are uncommon. In the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 Tokelau Judicial Annual Reports, it was reported that no civil cases were filed.\\"Tokelau Judicial Annual Report 2011-2012\\", Office of the Council for the Ongoing Government of Tokelau.

Rahman (2006), p. 140 The main battle took place in Al Wajbah Fort. After the Ottomans' unsuccessful attempt at seizing the fort, they retreated first to Shebaka Fort, and then to their fort in Al Bidda. Shortly after, Al Thani's troop besieged the fortress and cut off the water supply of the neighborhood, resulting in the concession of defeat by the Ottomans. Following this was an agreement to relinquish the Qatari captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed Pasha's cavalry to Hofuf by land.H. Rahman (2006), p. 152 Although Qatar did not gain full independence from the Ottoman Empire, the result of the battle is seen by Qatar as a defining moment in the establishment of Qatar as a modern state and the Ottoman's rule was over in Qatar. Background Despite the disapproval of local tribes, Al Thani continued supporting Ottoman rule. However, Qatari-Ottoman relations soon stagnated, and in 1882 they suffered further setbacks when the Ottomans refused to aid Al Thani in his expedition of Abu Dhabi-occupied Khawr al Udayd. Al Thani fell out of favour with the Ottomans after they received complaints from Qataris regarding his oppressions from 1885 to 1886.F. Anscombe (1997), p. 87 In a further blow to bilateral relations, the Ottomans supported the Ottoman subject Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab who attempted to supplant Al Thani as kaymakam of Qatar in 1888.H. Rahman (2006), pp. 143–144 In 1890, the Ottomans attempted to further consolidate their influence over Qatar by imposing numerous administrative reforms, increasing taxes and stationing additional troops in their garrison at Al Bidda. This eventually led Al Thani to rebel against the Ottomans, who he believed were seeking to usurp control of the peninsula. He resigned as kaymakam and stopped paying taxes in August 1892.H. Rahman (2006), pp. 150–151 Chronology Negotiations In October 1892, an Ottoman army comprising approximately 200 men led by the governor of Basra, Mehmed Hafiz Pasha, was sent to Qatar in response to Al Thani's transgressions.M. Althani (2013), pp. 101–102 They arrived in February 1893, with further reinforcements en route from Kuwait. Al Thani, fearing that he would face death or imprisonment, fled first to Al Daayen, and then to Al Wajbah Fort (10 miles west of Doha) where he was accompanied by several Qatari tribes. Mehmed sent a letter to Al Thani demanding that he disband his troops and pledge loyalty to the Ottomans. However, Al Thani remained adamant in his refusal to comply with Ottoman authority, and, additionally, refused to meet with Mehmed himself on the basis of ill health. Instead, he appointed his brother, Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Thani, as his emissary. In March, after a month of back-and-forth parleying, Mehmed lost patience and imprisoned Al Thani's brother and between 13 and 16 prominent Qatari tribal leaders on the Ottoman corvette Merrikh.A. Fromherz (2012), p. 60 He also blockaded the village of Al Wajbah. Al Thani offered to pay a fee of ten thousand liras in return for the captives' release, but Mehmed declined his offer. Battle After declining Sheikh Jassim Al Thani's offer, Mehmed ordered a column of troops to advance towards Al Wajbah Fort under the command of general Yusuf Effendi.M. Althani (2013), pp. 103–104 Shortly after Effendi's troops arrived at Al Wajbah, they came under heavy gunfire from Qatari infantry and cavalry troops, which totalled 3,000 to 4,000 men. After seven hours of exchange of gunfire, the Ottomans retreated to Shebaka fortress, where they sustained further casualties from a Qatari incursion. The Ottomans also lost contact with their incoming reinforcements from Kuwait, as their messages had been intercepted by Qatari Bedouins.F. Anscombe (1997), p. 88 The Ottoman troops retreated for a third time, to their fortress in Al Bidda, where their corvette was stationed. They proceeded to fire indiscriminately at the townspeople, killing a number of civilians. Shortly after, Al Thani's advancing column besieged the fortress and cut off the water supply of the neighbourhood. Without water and lacking in supplies, the Ottomans conceded defeat and agreed to relinquish the Qatari captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed's cavalry to Hofuf by land. A report by the British government published one year after the battle states the following: Aftermath Out of fear of further rebellion, the Ottoman government granted Al Thani a full pardon.R. Said (1979), p. 54 Furthermore, the Ottoman sultan, Abdülhamid II, deposed Mehmed Hafiz Pasha as governor of Basra. Although Qatar did not gain full independence from the Ottoman Empire until 1915, the result of the battle further consolidated the Al Thani rule over the country.P. Casey & P. Vine (1991), p. 45 It is also seen by Qataris as a defining moment in the establishment of Qatar as a modern state.

She made her debut in 1996 as a 3D CG character. Despite her virtual nature, she was treated as talent by Horipro. She never enjoyed great popularity, but after her debut she intermittently continued her activities, with a Version 2 emerging in 2001 and a Version 3 in 2007.  Naming  Kyoko Date was developed under the code name \\"DK-96\\", and debuted in 1996 under the stage name . \\"DK\\" was an abbreviation for \\"Digital Kids\\", while \\"96\\" indicated that this was the 1996 version. The name Kyoko Date was chosen as a Japanese-sounding name to represent the Digital Kids initials, and it was listed as her real name on her official profile. The year after her release, her code name was updated to \\"Kyoko Date DK-97\\", and in 1999 she made her Korean debut under the name \\"DiKi\\". The version that appeared in 2001 was called \\"Kyoko Date DK-2001\\". The 2007 version is simply known as \\"Kyoko Date\\" and has no code name.  First appearance  Kyoko Date was developed in collaboration with Visual Science Laboratory, Inc. to commemorate the 35th anniversary of Horipro's founding. The production was headed by Horipro's future president Yoshitaka Hori, the second son of founder Takeo Hori. The idea originated in 1995, the year before Kyoko's debut. It was hoped that, at a time when the number of media channels available was increasing, a virtual idol would be able to appear without the problem of time restrictions. Meanwhile, dating sims like Tokimeki Memorial were also popular, and its heroine Shiori Fujisaki, among others, was being called a \\"virtual idol\\", being treated as a talent, and gaining popularity. As Horipro embarked on the development of a 3D CG virtual idol, some thought that the current world of show business would be taken over by such popular virtual characters, and an environment welcoming of anime voice actors and game characters would also accept a CG idol. In early 1990, Hori was working as the director for the radio station Nippon Broadcasting System, and became involved with a project born on the radio program of Hikaru Ijūin to produce a fictional idol, . This experience also influenced Kyoko's development. Kyoko's fictional biography, on the other hand, stated that she was first scouted while working part-time at a hamburger shop in front of Fussa Station. Ten Horipro employees and 50 technical staffers worked on Kyoko Date's development, and the initial monetary investment in the project was said to be on the order of several tens of millions of yen (hundreds of thousands of dollars). Hori's group first designed an illustration on which further production was based. The CG artist Tatsuya Kosaka (KonKon) was in charge of the modeling work. Her voice was provided by a human actress, chosen from 50 of Horipro's associated talent and female employees on the basis of having an appropriate voice for an idol. Her singing voice and her speaking voice were provided by different individuals. Horipro created the script when she spoke on the radio or elsewhere. Kyoko's movements were animated via motion capture, then a very new technology, and recorded by American dancers. Producing content was very expensive, costing several million yen (tens of thousands of dollars) for a stage appearance. This far exceeded the cost of simply paying a new talent, but it was viewed as a pioneering investment in a new genre. Her actual range of activities included CD sales and radio and television appearances, but virtual live shows and the sale of photobooks were also under consideration. Horipro viewed Date as a dream talent for the multimedia age of the 21st century: she would never get sick or be involved in any scandals, she could appear simultaneously on any number of channels worldwide, and she could speak and sing in any language of the world. This would allow her to perform on a global scale cheaply, quickly, and precisely. Yet in spite of these advantages, and in spite of sales promotion, it was issues such as the unnatural quality of her movements that came to the fore. An announcement was originally planned to precede a debut in the fall of 1995, but development experienced delays. The project was officially announced in May 1996 but produced no releases until the end of that year. Before the debut, Kyoko attracted a lot of attention, including from the overseas media, but the delay gave the hype time to cool off, which may have contributed to the project's lack of success. Because radio performances required only a voice actor, Kyoko first became active in that field, appearing on the Tokyo FM radio program G1 Grouper in October 1996. On November 2, she made her video and chatting appearance on the TBS informational program . Her CD debut came on November 21 with the single LOVE COMMUNICATION but sold less than 30,000 units.According to a January 8, 1997, feature on NHK Close-up Gendai In 1997 her voice was changed, her name was updated to \\"Kyoko Date DK-97, and her CD single Touch was released on July 21. She appeared on posters of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and on the front cover of the ad magazine , but in the end, Kyoko Date disappeared after just a few months of minor activity. Still, the publicity she provided is said to have served Horipro well in their later projects. Meanwhile, on December 5, 1996, Fujisaki Shiori of Tokimeki Memorial made her own CD debut as a virtual idol with Oshiete Mr. Sky. Although comparable in concept to Kyoko Date, this debut was a hit, in stark contrast to Kyoko's stagnation. This may have been because Kyoko was essentially an evolution of the existing notion of an idol, while Fujisaki represented a new kind of idol able to win the hearts of anime and game fans. Fujisaki's debut as a singer was run by Watanabe Digital Media & Communications, a company associated with Watanabe Productions and headed by the eldest daughter of its founder , Miki Watanabe. At the time, Yoshitaka Hori and Miki Watanabe were seen by some as the second-generation leaders of the entertainment industry's leading production companies. Others opined that even if Kyoko were to find success as a radio DJ, her real success would come only after the person who provided her voice discarded the facade of Kyoko's character and emerged into the spotlight personally. In 1999, Kyoko debuted in South Korea under the name \\"DiKi\\" with an album entitled Between, but again found no success.

Second appearance  In 2001, a version of Kyoko Date titled \\"Kyoko Date DK-2001\\" served as the navigator for a series of general-audience, internet-based lectures from the Kanazawa Institute of Technology called . It was intended that this version proceed on to appearing in online advertisements, and Horipro explained away the character's earlier failure as a result of being \\"ahead of her time\\", but DK-2001 too vanished without any significant activity. This version was supposed to have born on June 9, 1983, and the modeler who created it used the pseudonym Sonehachi.  Third appearance  In 2007, Kyoko Date once again reemerged as an avatar in the virtual world Second Life. The design of this version was based on that of DK-2001. She appeared mainly as an event MC, but as the popularity of Second Life dwindled, she soon stopped her activities once again. Kaori Date Around the year 2000, the creation of 3D CG idols was popular among modelers, and Kyoko Date's original modeler Tatsuya Kosaka created another character, , who was alternately described as the younger cousin or younger sister of Kyoko Date.

The museum has a cooperation agreement with the municipality of Gjemnes. The head of the museum is Ståle Tangen. The museum was established as the Kristiansund Museum in 1894, and from the beginning the main building was an exhibition pavilion from the large-scale fishing exhibition held in 1892. Together with the museum's founder, Anders Sandvig, the committed young museologist Wilhelm Lund laid plans in Lillehammer for a major open-air cultural museum in Kristiansund. The Almskår farmhouse, one of the last authentic open-hearth farmhouses from Nordmøre, was moved to Kristiansund. The museum also acquired a raised granary before it was realized that the weather in Kristiansund was not suited to a regular open-air museum with transferred buildings. The Kristiansund Museum was badly damaged when the city with its old wooden houses was bombed by German aircraft in April 1940. The museum lost most of its collection when the pavilion burned down. In the 1960s, the small open-air museum was moved to Dalen Farm on the outskirts of the city, which was regarded as preservation-worthy. In 1965 the museum opened a new fireproof brick building at the Knudtzondal Farm on the city's outskirts. In 1980, the museum focused on heritage conservation at the harbor in Kristiansund, where the museum is represented by the Norwegian Dried Cod Museum and Mellem Shipyard, where historical sailing ships are also restored.

History On 29 June 1885, the Eastern Railway opened from Chidlow's Well to York. Another line opened south to Beverley on 5 August 1886 and ultimately Albany via the Great Southern Railway. On 9 September 1897, construction commenced on a line to Greenhills, with the line opening on 1 September 1898. On 24 April 1908, it was extended to Quairading, and to Bruce Rock on 4 July 1913. The line was initially served by a thrice weekly mixed train; this was later reduced to twice weekly. Once the line from Bruce Rock to Merredin was opened in December 1913, a through service was introduced. In 1938, a thrice weekly through service from Perth to Merredin was introduced with ADE railcars. This reduced the travel time from 17 hours to eight. In August 1949, a road bus service was introduced. By January 1951, the railcar service had been reduced to once weekly and was withdrawn entirely in March 1952. Diesel locomotives were introduced to the line in 1955, working in parallel with steam locomotives until 1970. In 1985, the line was closed between Yoting and Shackleton, the line now operating as two separate lines from York to Yoting and Bruce Rock to Shackleton.

It was designed by Henry Charles Stanley and built from 1885 to 1886 by H A Brigg. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The second section of the Brisbane Valley Branch line from Lowood to Esk was let on contract to H. A. Brigg on 2 December 1884 for . The line was opened for traffic between Lowood and Esk on 9 August 1886. Operating the Brisbane Valley Branch was expensive because the light standard of the line limited engines to B15 standard. As there were many heavy grades on the line, more powerful locomotives could produce substantial savings in the number of trains needed. Using Great Depression relief labour to reduce the cost, strengthening the line to C16 and C17 standard was completed between 1931 and 1933. In 1932 a central timber pier was added to strengthen the lattice girder span. In 1968 in preparation for the operation of diesel engine locomotives in both single and multiple operation, the longitudinal members were strengthened by the addition of 6x channels along each side and 9x transoms laid over the top. The timber piers supporting the span were provided with concrete bases. The railway closed for traffic in March 1993.  Description  Lockyer Creek Railway Bridge (Clarendon), 2008 The bridge features a half-through double x 2 lattice girder bridge on a straight alignment and carrying a single track. Its spans are: * 2x2x timber longitudinals, common timber trestles with 2 unbraced uprights (Pier 1), 3 single braced uprights (Pier 2) and 5 double braced uprights (Pier 3). * 1x2x timber longitudinals, common timber trestles. 1x () half-through double x2 lattice girders, channel strengthened timber longitudinals and transom top, timber piers at each end on concrete bases, strengthened with double timber pier at centre span. * 3x2x timber longitudinals, common timber trestles with 5 double braced uprights (Piers 6 and 7) and 4 single braced uprights (Pier 8). * 3x2x timber longitudinals, common timber trestles with 4 single braced uprights (Pier 8), 3 single braced uprights (Piers 9 and 10) and 2 unbraced uprights (Pier 11). The approaches are timber girders.  Heritage listing  Lockyer Creek Railway Bridge at Clarendon was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The bridge with a half-through double x 2 lattice girder spans is one of the oldest existing metal truss bridges with Miva (1886) and Wide Bay Creek (1886), and the second extant of its type constructed in Queensland with the longest span of its type in Queensland between 1884 and 1932. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. This is one of the few major bridges on the Brisbane Valley Branch. Its design incorporating a lattice girder span supported on timber piers is similar in concept to bridges on the original Ipswich to Toowoomba line, opened in 1867, but on which all such bridges have long been removed. Although a single timber pier has been provided to strengthen the span effectively making two spans to carry heavier loads, it still shows the original mode of construction clearly. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The bridge with a half-through double x 2 lattice girder spans is one of the oldest existing metal truss bridges with Miva (1886) and Wide Bay Creek (1886), and the second extant of its type constructed in Queensland with the longest span of its type in Queensland between 1884 and 1932. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The design was associated with the Chief Engineer, Henry Charles Stanley.

On October 9, 2020, 505 Games announced the cancellation of all future updates and content for Indivisible following the dissolution of Lab Zero Games. Gameplay Indivisible features platform- style action RPG exploration and combat mechanics inspired by Valkyrie Profile. Plot The game begins with a battle between a group of warriors led by Indr (voiced by Keith Silverstein) and the goddess Kala (voiced by Anjali Bhimani). The battle ends with Kala being defeated and sealed on Mount Sumeru while Indr finds an abandoned baby they call Ajna (voiced by Tania Gunadi) and raises her as his own daughter. 16 years later, Ajna lives with her father in the village of Ashwat until it is attacked by an army led by Dhar (voiced by Benjamin Diskin), who kills her father. After defeating Dhar, Ajna uses her newly awakened power to absorb him into her mind and forces him to take her to his leader, the warlord Ravannavar (voiced by Michael Dorn) who ordered the attack. While gaining more companions, Ajna eventually confronts and chases Ravannavar to Mount Sumeru where she kills him, unaware that Ravannavar's intention was to use her power to unseal Kala, given that she is a part of her body, so that she destroys and recreates the world. After being cast out of Sumeru, Ajna and her companions are rescued by the Deva Thorani (voiced by Zehra Fazal), who guides her to the nearby port, where she meets Angwu (voiced by Laura Patalano) a former member of Indr's party who instructs Ajna to look for several chakra gates around the world and activate them so that she increases her power in preparation to face Kala in battle. After doing so, Ajna returns to Sumeru despite being warned by her friends that she may be not ready yet, and while facing Kala, she loses herself to anger, becoming a monster that causes massive destruction until a reformed Dhar sacrifices himself to stop her. One week later, Ajna recovers and determined to atone for her mistakes, travels the world again to regroup with her friends, while helping solve some problems she unwillingly caused during her previous journey, and returns to Sumeru for a final battle with Kala. In the occasion, Ajna bids farewell to her companions and convinces Kala to give up on destroying the world, the two merging together and disappearing. In the post credits, an image of Ajna is seen, living a new life while merged with Kala. Development Indivisible was announced by Lab Zero Games during their Skullgirls panel at the Anime Expo on July 2, 2015. According to the developer, the game's storyline was influenced by southeast Asian mythology and other cultures. It also features 2D hand-drawn animation by Lab Zero Games' artists. Composer Hiroki Kikuta, best known for his work on Secret of Mana, scored the game's soundtrack. The game features animation by Japanese anime studio Trigger and American animation studio Titmouse, Inc., with the opening animation directed by Yoh Yoshinari of Little Witch Academia. Lab Zero Games launched a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo on October 5, 2015, with a goal of . A playable prototype of the game was released in tandem with the launch. If Lab Zero Games met or exceeded their goal, publisher 505 Games would contribute their remaining development budget. The campaign's initial 40-day contribution period faced relatively sluggish fundraising, earning approximately $764,000 by November 8, 2015. However, on November 13, 2015, the campaign was extended for an additional 20 days after the game received roughly 963,000 in pledges, above Indiegogo's required 60% threshold. Following the extension, the goal was eventually reached on December 2, 2015. The game was released on October 8, 2019 in North America and released three days later in Europe. The game was eventually released on Nintendo Switch on April 28, 2020. However, this was done without any input from Lab Zero Games and was instead given a surprise release by a porting group. As a result, the game's launch was given no prior announcement and came as a surprise even to the original developers. Additionally, the Switch version was also launched missing features that were added through updates, such as co-operative play and New Game+ mode. This was due to the game accidentally launching on its original planned release date, rather than being delayed to early May 2020 as was intended. On October 9, 2020, 505 Games announced the cancellation of all future updates and content for Indivisible following the dissolution of Lab Zero Games. Animated series On July 17, 2020, it was announced that an animated adaptation of Indivisible was in development and would be released on the Peacock streaming service. The series was to be produced by DJ2 Entertainment and Legendary Television. Reception Both the PlayStation 4 and PC versions of Indivisible received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to Metacritic. Joe Juba of Game Informer praised the game's art style, animation, music and combat but criticized the backtracking and some other issues with the combat.

The army was formed by combining the three armies that were engaged in the War in the Vendée and appointing Lazare Hoche to command. While the army's nominal strength was 182,956 men at the time of its formation, this declined to 117,746 during the year. Because its operations were successful, the army was disbanded in September 1796 and approximately half its personnel sent to other armies. History Lazare Hoche The Army of the Coasts of the Ocean was created by an order of 26 December 1795 which was executed on 5–8 January 1796. The army was formed by combining the Army of the West, the Army of the Coasts of Brest and the Army of the Coasts of Cherbourg. Its first and only commander-in-chief was Lazare Hoche, although from 10 July until mid-August the chief of staff Gabriel Marie Joseph, comte d'Hédouville carried out the orders of Hoche while he was in Paris. Hoche arrived in Angers on 5 January and took over the Army of the West the next day. He assumed command of the Brest and Cherbourg armies on 8 January. On its creation, the army's paper strength was 182,956 soldiers, though only about 100,000 troops were available. The former armies became divisions in the new army; the Brest army became the West Division, the Cherbourg army became the East Division and the Army of the West became the South Division. South was led by Amédée Willot. Hoche had much experience with the War in the Vendée. He was appointed commander of the Army of the Coasts of Cherbourg on 1 September 1794 and he also assumed leadership of the Army of the Coasts of Brest starting on 10 November 1794. His tenure with the Cherbourg army ended on 30 April 1795 when Jean-Baptiste Annibal Aubert du Bayet took command. Hoche continued to lead the Brest army until 10 September 1795 when Gabriel Venance Rey replaced him. On 11 September he became commander of the Army of the West and led it until 17 December 1795 when Willot temporarily replaced him. When Hoche took command of the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean, 11 army commanders and 120 general officers had been employed in putting down the Vendean rebellion, without success. Uniquely, he learned how to deal with the revolt. Execution of Charette, in Nantes, March 1796, by Julien Le Blant By 1796 Hoche had a free hand because, unlike earlier governments, the French Directory did not need to approve every operation. With unity of command and near-dictatorial powers, his expeditions continuously pressed the insurgents. An earlier truce worked in his favor by allowing the rebels to briefly enjoy peace; afterward they were less inclined to fight. Elsewhere, French victories over the First Coalition armies made Royalist prospects look dim. At length, rebel leaders Jean-Nicolas Stofflet and François de Charette were captured and executed. By March 1796 the south bank of the Loire River was pacified and Hoche deployed 15,000 infantry and two cavalry regiments against the Chouans on the north bank. By May the Chouannerie was quelled after most of the leaders were captured or gave up. In return for peace, Hoche promised that the priests had religious freedom while the young men would not be conscripted into the army. About 2,000 Republican deserters fighting for the rebels surrendered and their only punishment was to return to the Republican army. The hard-liners were not pleased with Hoche's lenient terms and wished that Willot had been in charge. However, the Directory was so thankful for Hoche's efforts that it publicly proclaimed him Pacificateur and bought him a pair of pistols, two good horses and riding tack. On 25 August 1796 the French government issued an order to dissolve the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean and it was carried out on 22 September. As early as 13 July, Hoche sent 13,078 troops to Italy and 27,000 to the forces on the Rhine River. While a total of 44,662 soldiers were sent to defend the frontiers, another 19,253 were reserved for the Expedition to Ireland of 1797. Out of a one-time total of 117,746 men, the remaining 53,831 men were retained in the so-called \\"Four Reunited Divisions\\", each commanded by a general. These were the 12th, 13th, 14th and 22nd Military Divisions. Hoche remained as overall commander of the four districts with Hédouville as his chief of staff. In September 1796 Emmanuel Grouchy took command of the 12th Division (Poitou) which consisted of the departments of Charente-Inférieure, Deux-Sèvres, Loire- Inférieure and Vendée south of the Loire. The 13th Division (Brittany) included the departments of Côtes-du-Nord, Finistère, Ille-et-Vilaine and Morbihan, the 14th Division (Normandy) the departments of Calvados, Manche and Orne and the 22nd Division (Maine and Anjou) the departments of Indre-et- Loire, Loir-et-Cher, Maine-et-Loire, Mayenne and Sarthe.

In 1970, he became federal president of the Liberal Party, where he managed leadership turmoil within the party after the election of the Whitlam Government in 1972 which saw many of Australia's ties with Britain abolished. With parliamentary preselection virtually assured, Southey's political hopes were dashed after confidential memos he had sent to Prime Minister William McMahon, in which he called for several newspaper editors to be \\"straightened out\\", were published in a book. Southey stood down as president in 1975, and did not seek election. By that time he was managing director of William Haughton, as well as chairman of several other companies. In 1978, he was invited to join the Australian Ballet as a director, and was appointed chairman in 1980 after resolving an industrial dispute and dancers' strike. Southey's involvement with the dance world had begun during his childhood, when his uncle, the ophthalmologist Ringland Anderson, looked after members of the Ballets Russes when they visited Australia.

She was formerly a model and car saleswoman. Shortly after meeting Wilson in 1986, she helped instigate Wilson's court-ordered separation from his therapist Eugene Landy. Ledbetter's account of these events was later dramatized for the 2014 biopic Love & Mercy, in which Ledbetter is portrayed by Elizabeth Banks. Personal life and career While working at a car dealership in 1986, Ledbetter met Brian Wilson while he was a patient under Eugene Landy's 24-hour therapy. Six months after meeting Wilson, she had reported Landy to the state's attorney general for ethical violations, but they informed her that nothing could be done without the cooperation of Wilson's family. Three years into Ledbetter and Wilson's relationship, Landy ordered Wilson to sever ties with Ledbetter. After Landy was struck with a 1991 court order which barred him from contacting Wilson, Wilson and Ledbetter reconnected and were married on February 6, 1995. Ledbetter went on to become Wilson's manager in 1999, a job which she says is \\"basically negotiating, and that's what I did every single day when I sold cars.\\" In 2015, Wilson credited Ledbetter for assisting with some of the production of his album No Pier Pressure. Love & Mercy Half of the 2014 Brian Wilson biopic Love & Mercy is set from Ledbetter's point of view in the 1980s, with Elizabeth Banks playing Ledbetter. Love & Mercy screenwriter Oren Moverman stated that virtually every event in the film's 1980s portions was sourced from conversations he had with Ledbetter. She said after watching the film: \\"I remembered that what Landy did to Brian was even worse. You don’t get a sense of it in the movie, but it happened on a daily basis, for years. Disputes In the mid 1990s, Wilson collaborated with multi-instrumentalist Andy Paley on tracks earmarked for a potential Beach Boys comeback album. In 1998, Uncut magazine wrote that Brian was \\"coerced away from Andy Paley (by Brian's wife Melinda, according to observers), toward [producer] Joe Thomas.\\" Rolling Stones Jason Fine reported: \\"She calls the Paley–Wilson material 'great therapy' but says his vocals are not up to par and believes the production isn't good enough to be released commercially. As is often the case with Brian's career, Brian doesn't seem to be the one calling the shots.\\" In 1999, a suit was filed against Thomas, seeking damages and a declaration which freed Wilson to work on his next album without involvement from Thomas. Thomas reciprocated with a suit citing that Ledbetter \\"schemed against and manipulated\\" him and Wilson. The case was settled out of court. According to Beach Boy Mike Love, the group's 50th anniversary reunion tour involving all original surviving members ended prematurely, partly due to interference from Ledbetter. He expressed disappointment that he was never allowed to collaborate with Wilson for the album That's Why God Made the Radio, as had been promised, and that during the performances, she attempted to install an autotune unit on each of the band members' microphones. This was the beginning of some backstage quarrels between Love and Ledbetter, which ended with his stipulating that she be banned from rehearsals until the tour was over.

United States, No. 13–9972, 575 U.S. ___ (2015), slip op. at 2–4. In a 6–3 opinion, the Court held that officers may not extend the length of a traffic stop to conduct a dog sniff unrelated to the original purpose of the stop.Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 1. However, the Court remanded the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to determine whether the officer's extension of the traffic stop was independently justified by reasonable suspicion.Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 9. Some analysts have suggested that the Court's decision to limit police authority was influenced by ongoing protests in Ferguson, Missouri.Noah Feldman, , April 21, 2015: The Supreme Court Is Worried About the Police (Accessed July 2, 2015); Mark Joseph Stern, , April 21, 2015: The Ferguson Effect – Chief Justice Roberts Rules Against Police Abuse at the Supreme Court. Maybe He Finally Gets It. (Accessed July 2, 2015). Background Constitutional guidelines for traffic stops Criminal detentions generally require probable cause that the suspect is engaged in criminal activity, but an officer may conduct a traffic stop if the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the driver is engaging in criminal activity.Berkemer v. McCarty, ; Delaware v. Prouse, ; Pennsylvania v. Mimms, ; see also Terry v. Ohio, (defining standards for investigatory stops). The Supreme Court of the United States has held that investigative detentions, including traffic stops, \\"must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\\"Florida v. Royer, . Consequently, traffic stops may become unreasonable if they are unnecessarily prolonged.United States v. Sharpe, . When an officer conducts a traffic stop based on reasonable suspicion that the driver has committed a traffic violation, the Fourth Amendment permits the officer to conduct a number of investigative inquiries before resolving the traffic stop.See, e.g., Arizona v. Johnson, . For example, officers may question the vehicle’s occupants about matters unrelated to the traffic violation, and officers may walk a drug detection dog around the outside of the vehicle during the stop.Johnson, 555 U.S. at 333; Illinois v. Caballes, (holding that officers may conduct a dog sniff incident to a lawful traffic stop). Officers may briefly prolong traffic stops to conduct these inquiries so long as the officer performs his tasks in an amount of time \\"reasonably needed to effectuate\\" the law enforcement purpose of the stop.United States v. Sharpe, . Arrest of Dennys Rodriguez On the evening of March 27, 2012, Dennys Rodriguez was stopped by a police officer on a highway near Waterloo, Nebraska, after the officer observed him swerve out of his lane of traffic.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 16–19. When the officer approached the vehicle, he reported an \\"overwhelming\\" scent of air-fresheners emanating from the car.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 20. After questioning Rodriguez and another passenger in the car, the officer placed a call for backup and conducted a records check on the vehicle’s passenger.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 23–27. The officer handed a warning ticket to Rodriguez, and then proceeded to walk Floyd, his drug detection dog, around the outside of Rodriguez’s vehicle.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 28–29. When the dog indicated the presence of drugs, the officer searched the car and discovered methamphetamine inside the vehicle.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 33–34. The officer reported that approximately seven or eight minutes passed between the time he issued the warning ticket to the time at which the dog indicated the presence of drugs.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 34. Dennys Rodriguez was arrested on a highway near Waterloo, Nebraska (pictured). Trial and appeal to Eighth Circuit On May 22, 2012, Rodriguez was indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska for possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 114. Rodriguez filed a motion to suppress evidence discovered by the drug detection dog, arguing that an officer may not extend an already completed traffic stop to conduct a canine sniff without reasonable suspicion or other lawful justification.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 6, 12. However, the district court denied the motion.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 112. On January 17, 2013, Rodriguez filed an appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to review the denial of his motion to suppress.Joint Appendix, Rodriguez v. United States, 35 S.Ct. 1609 (U.S. 2015) at 11. On January 31, 2014, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s decision to deny Rodriguez’s motion to suppress the evidence.United States v. Rodriguez, 741 F.3d 905, 908 (8th Cir. 2014). The Eighth Circuit held that a seven- to eight-minute detention was de minimis and reasonable in order to ensure officer safety.United States v. Rodriguez, 741 F.3d 905, 907–08 (8th Cir. 2014). Rodriguez appealed this decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari on October 2, 2014.Rodriguez v. United States, 135 S.Ct. 43 (2014) (granting certiorari). Opinion of the Court In her majority opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (pictured) held that \\"a dog sniff is not fairly characterized as part of the officer’s traffic mission.\\"Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 7. Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg held that \\"a police stop exceeding the time needed to handle the matter for which the stop was made violates the Constitution’s shield against unreasonable seizures.\\" Consequently, a traffic stop becomes unlawful if \\"it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete the mission of issuing a ticket for the violation.\\"Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 1 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Justice Ginsburg wrote that the purpose of the initial stop in this case was to investigate why Rodriguez swerved out of his lane of traffic.Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 5. Therefore, the officer's authority to continue the stop ended once he completed his investigation of that infraction. Because the dog sniff was unrelated to the investigation of the original traffic infraction, the officer should not have extended the stop absent \\"independently supported reasonable suspicion\\" for the dog sniff.Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 7–9. The Court then remanded the case to the Eighth Circuit to determine whether the officer did, in fact, have an independent basis for conducting the dog sniff. Dissenting opinions Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, and Justice Samuel Alito each wrote a dissenting opinion. Justice Thomas argued that the brief extension to conduct a dog sniff was reasonable and that \\"conducting a dog sniff does not change the character of a traffic stop that is lawful at its inception and otherwise executed in a reasonable manner.\\"Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 1, 9–10 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing Illinois v. Caballes, (internal quotation marks omitted). He also argued that the dog sniff was independently justified by the officer's reasonable suspicion that Rodriguez and his passenger were engaged in criminal activity.Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 10–12 (Thomas, J., dissenting). In a one-paragraph dissenting opinion, Justice Kennedy wrote that he agreed with all of Justice Thomas' opinion, except his conclusion that the officer had reasonable suspicion.Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 1 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Because the Eighth Circuit did not address the question of whether the officer had reasonable suspicion, he argued \\"the better course would be to allow that court to do so in the first instance.\\" Justice Alito wrote a dissent in which he characterized the majority opinion as \\"unnecessary, impractical, and arbitrary.\\"Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 1 (Alito, J., dissenting). He argued that the dog sniff was justified because the facts of the case \\"easily meet our standard for reasonable suspicion.\\"Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 1–2 (Alito, J., dissenting) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Justice Alito also criticized Justice Ginsburg's opinion for ignoring concerns of officer safety, and that the occupants of the car may have attacked the officer if he conducted the dog sniff before backup arrived.Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 2–3 (Alito, J., dissenting). Additionally, Justice Alito claimed it was \\"arbitrary\\" for the court to hold the Fourth Amendment was violated \\"simply because of the sequence in which Officer Struble chose to perform his tasks.\\"Rodriguez v. United States, slip op. at 3 (Alito, J., dissenting). Afterward On remand, the Eighth Circuit ruled that because the police could rely in good faith on binding precedent from the Eighth Circuit, which at the time of the stop held that briefly prolonging a stop was legal, Rodriguez was entitled to no relief.United States v. Rodriguez, 799 F.3d 1222, 1223-24 (8th Cir. 2015). The United States Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of that decision. Rodriguez v. United States, 136 S.Ct. 1514 (Mem) (2016). Commentary and analysis Commentators have observed that Rodriguez represents a significant departure from the Court's prior dog sniff cases and that the Court's \\"view of the canine sniff investigatory technique is evolving.\\"Leslie Shoebotham, , April 22, 2015: Guest Blog: Leslie Shoebotham, SCOTUS: No Post-“Traffic Mission” Dog Sniffs Without Reasonable Suspicion (Accessed July 2, 2015). One analyst suggested the Court \\"is quietly distancing itself from its decision three decades ago in United States v. Place,\\"United States v. Place, . where the Court held that a dog sniff is not a search under the Fourth Amendment. Other commentators praised the case for \\"strengthening\\" and \\"reinvigorating\\" constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, Nina Totenberg of National Public Radio observed that despite the Supreme Court's favorable ruling, Rodriguez \\"is not free of legal trouble yet\\" because the Eighth Circuit may, and ultimately did, rule the dog sniff was permissible.Nina Totenberg, , April 21, 2015: Supreme Court: Police May Not Detain Traffic Violators Longer Than Necessary (Accessed July 2, 2015).Rordriguez, 799 F.3d 1222, 1223-24. Some analysts have also suggested that the Court's opinion was influenced by ongoing protests in Ferguson, Missouri. One commentator suggested the court's decision may have been shaped, in part, by recent high-profile \\"killings of black men by police\\" and that the Court's opinion was \\"affected by changing social attitudes\\" about the role of police in society.Noah Feldman, , April 21, 2015: The Supreme Court Is Worried About the Police (Accessed July 2, 2015). Another suggested that Chief Justice John Roberts may have been influenced by the shooting of Michael Brown and that he \\"learned the lessons of Ferguson and is trading in his logical abstractions for some much-needed legal realism.\\"Mark Joseph Stern, , April 21, 2015: The Ferguson Effect – Chief Justice Roberts Rules Against Police Abuse at the Supreme Court.
