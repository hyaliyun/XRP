How to become an applied equine podiatrist. Retrieved from http://equinepodiatry.com/ Some are veterinarians who have chosen to specialize in the equine hoof, while some are remedial farriers. There is also a new group of specialists known as an \\"Applied Equine Podiatrist\\", this specialist may have neither a veterinary nor a farriery background. This specialist works with horse owners, veterinarians, and farriers to improve the health of the hoof without the use of rigid horseshoes and by taking a more holistic approach. The designation DAEP denotes those that have achieved a diploma from the Institute of Applied Equine Podiatry. The equine podiatrist profession can extend to include other equines, such as donkeys and mules. Only registered farriers are permitted to shoe horses in the UK. A human podiatrist is not a M.D. with an interest in feet, but a separate profession with a unique education and licensing system. The use of this term within the equine community has no distinct mandatory education or certification. This can result in confusion as the horse owner is often unaware that the equine podiatrist is a self-appointed title. Overview The common adage ‚Äúno foot, no horse‚Äù rings true in that the shape and soundness of a horse‚Äôs hoof dictates the tasks it can perform.O‚ÄôGrady, S.E. (2003). Preface: Podiatry. Vet. Clin. Equine, 19 (2), xi-xii Equine athletes asked to perform at intense levels of competition experience a great deal of wear on the internal and external structures of the hoof. Additionally, the variation in hoof structure is also dependent upon many other factors, including age, genetics, nutrition, and breed.O‚ÄôGrady, S.E., & Poupard, D.A. (2003). Proper physiologic horseshoeing. Vet. Clin. Equine, 19 (2), 333-351.Bowker, R.M. (2003). Contrasting structural morphologies of ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù footed horses. AAEP Proceedings, 49, 187-209. Equine podiatry essentially characterizes the factors that contribute to a reduction in hoof health and performance such as poor conformation, improper hoof trimming and/or shoeing, intense exercise, and insufficient hoof tissue maturation.O‚ÄôGrady, S.E. (2006). Barefoot vs. Shod? It depends‚Ä¶ Retrieved from http://equipodiatry.com/article_barefoot_v_shod.htm Podiatrists also study the ways in which hoof function can be managed and improved in the equine athlete, and work to prevent the incidence of foot problems through proper hoof maintenance or the use of protective shoeing.O‚ÄôGrady, S.E. (2006). Northern Virginia Equine: Therapeutic farriery & equine podiatry consulting service. Retrieved from http://equipodiatry.com/index.html Shod Versus Shoeless Debate Horse being fitted with a horseshoe. Minimal connectedness among farriers, scientists and equine veterinarians contributes to ambiguity among practitioners. In addition, many of the current procedures in this area are based on personal opinion and traditional practices rather than factual information based on clinical research. The controversy currently surrounding equine podiatry is whether or not horses should be shod or left barefoot. Traditionally, the practice of horseshoeing was implemented to prevent wear of the hoof wall; however, the modern argument is that traditional farriery with steel shoes can restrict natural flexion of the hoof wall, cause hoof deformities, induce lameness, and increase the incidence of horse injury.Teskey, T.G. (2005). The unfettered foot; A paradigm change for equine podiatry. Equine Foot Science, 25(2), 77-83. It is stated that these ailments result from the horseshoe‚Äôs tendency to distribute concussive forces unevenly across the foot. Proponents of this side are of the belief that horses should be left barefoot and given ample opportunity to develop the internal and external hoof tissues by natural means. For example, regular impact on firm ground stimulates sensory receptors in the hoof that, in turn, induce a physiologic response to promote strengthening of the hoof wall and an increased sole thickness. On the other hand, some insist that the choice of whether or not to shoe should be considered on a case-by-case basis. They agree that it is favorable to allow horses to be shoeless when possible, for the same reasons as those listed above. They also point out, however, that the use of shoes can be beneficial in many instances. This includes times when wear of the hoof exceeds its growth, or when extra traction is needed for horses in competition. Horseshoes can also be used to correct lameness, stabilize hoof cracks, and realign bone in the case of laminitis. Many proponents of this ideal argue for the natural development of proper hoof structure at a young age, guided only by appropriate trimming and shaping of the hoof as needed. In the first three years in a horse‚Äôs life, adequate hoof development stems mainly from stimulation of the horse receptors during normal exercise and turn out; however, the intense training experienced by two-year- old racehorses puts excess stress on the immature bone structure. When the horse is shod to alleviate the resulting discomfort, the hoof receptors lose contact with the ground, which further weakens the foot. Without proper treatment, this will often lead to the development of chronic hoof problems. While both sides argue valid points, further research is needed to better understand the factors that contribute to improved hoof health and equine performance.

Born into a very prominent and wealthy slave-holding family, he was educated in England, lost his father at the age of 10, and rounded off his gentleman's upbringing through Westminster School and Oxford University with a Grand Tour. He inherited his estates around Hertford in western Jamaica around 1765 at the age of 21. In a different mould from his colonial ancestors, he was considered a cultivated and personally sensitive man who, after he married and went to live in Jamaica in 1774 to supervise his affairs personally, became preoccupied with the welfare and conditions of the African and Creole workers in his estates, deplored their mistreatment and hardships and sought to deal with them more humanely. However, he had too open and naive a nature to survive as a businessman, and, facing losses through natural catastrophes, and subjected to predatory actions by his creditors, found that his estates had become heavily involved in debt. Returning to England in 1787 to mend his affairs, he was thrown into debtor's prison, from where he wrote and published two books descriptive of Jamaica, of the industry of the estates and of the circumstances of the enslaved labourers. He advocated reform at every level, in transportation, domestic welfare, working conditions and management, and rights before the law, but not, finally, the dismantling of the system itself, arguing that this would lead to greater deprivations. By the adjustment of his debts he lost his estates but retained ¬£400 a year, and remaining in England he devoted his last years to writing both in prose and poetry. As a member of a highly privileged class, despite his personal misfortunes, his contribution to the History of France has to be understood in the light of the French Revolution and the fall of Robespierre, which occurred in the year of its publication.

Beckford remained in the Fleet Prison (the debtor's prison in London) for three years, and resolved to make good use of his time there by writing on the subjects of which he had immediate knowledge. The first of his prison books, Remarks upon the Situation of Negroes in Jamaica, was effectively a long essay dictated in February 1788 and prepared for the press in June of that year.M. Parker, The Sugar Barons. Family, Corruption, Empire and War (Hutchinson, London 2011), pp. 336-39 (Google) The book was based on his own observation of the conditions and behaviour of the people described, and was at first intended for private circulation. The terms in which he speaks of the enslaved peoples and their character belongs to the age in which that system was deeply entrenched, but in which the movement for emancipation was gathering momentum. He appealed to the vital importance of maintaining civilized, humane standards of management, health, social organization and justice for those populations. However, he approved the continuance of the system itself, for although he considered it repugnant, he argued that greater suffering and degradation would result from abandoning or attempting to dismantle it.

This work contains many biographical details of Beckford's life in Jamaica. In volume II of this work Beckford made the following observation: > \\"It is customary with the liberal creditor to suffer the indebted planter to > reside upon his mortgaged premises, to superintend the white people, and to > direct the cultivation of the land; to dispose of his rum to discharge the > contingencies of the country, to recommend captains of ships to convey his > stores to the island, and to have the preference of freight to England, and > to be indulged with such articles and conveniences as the plantation > affords; to have the liberty to reside upon it, and likewise to share the > same emoluments that an attorney would have; and under such a compact, a > planter may not have much to apprehend, nor the merchant much to fear, as > confidence is the best connective band of interest; whereas dissension and > distrust, while they sour the mind, will ultimately conduct to ruin. To be, > on the other hand, forbidden the least interference whatever with his > concerns, to be proceeded against to the utmost remnant of his means, to be > deprived of common subsistence; and, to encrease his mortification, to > behold all at once a man become his master, who but a few years before was > contented to be his servant; all these are bitter circumstances which the > planter too often suffers, and which it is certainly heart-breaking to > endure.\\"A Descriptive Account of the Island of Jamaica, II, pp. 358-59 > (Google). In this work (which contains many digressions), Beckford refers to his friendship with the musician and historian of music Dr Charles Burney.A Descriptive Account of the Island of Jamaica, I, p. 220-223 (Internet Archive). In October 1791 Dr Burney wrote that his son-in-law Charles Rousseau Burney (1747-1819), a very accomplished harpsichordist and violinist, was in the habit of visiting Beckford in the Fleet once a week to dine with him, and to play to him \\"on a miserable pianoforte for five or six hours at a time.\\"P.H.

Dr. Burney wrote to his daughter (Fanny), \\"I have been lately reading my much beloved and unfortunate friend Mr Beckford's account of Jamaica. My heart bleeds for him at every page.

In 1794, in which year the Reign of Terror came to its climax in Paris with the fall of Robespierre, Beckford's historical work, A History of France, from the Most Early Records to the Death of Louis XVI was published in London in four volumes. The title-page advertizes that the \\"ancient\\" part was written by William Beckford (this, also, was written in the Fleet), and the \\"modern\\" part by an English gentleman resident in Paris.W. Beckford and anon., A History of France, from the Most Early Records to the Death of Louis XVI, 4 vols (J.S. Jordan, London 1794), vol. I, vol. II, vol. III, vol. IV (Google). To judge from the shift in written style, Beckford's work continues down to the end of Chapter XXXIII in volume 3 (page 160), anno 1442, and in the next chapter the narrative is resumed (without any remark) by the second author, whose style is slightly less rhetorical.A History of France, from the Most Early Records, III, p. 160 ff. (Google). Beckford's travels in France had been mentioned in Brydone's first Letter, and the first volume of Beckford's History opens with an engraved Letter of Dedication to William Vyse, with a vignette of Lambeth Palace, stating \\"I have always acknowledged your confidence and friendship to be the pride and comfort of my Life.\\" By giving up his estates in trust to adjust his debt, Beckford was able to keep ¬£400 a year, and devoted himself to literary pursuits. Death and an appreciation The editor of the Monthly Mirror in 1799, evidently writing from personal knowledge, referred to various literary contributions by Beckford of Somerley, some already published and others transmitted to him by the author which the magazine proposed to insert from time to time. Beckford was improving both in health and fortune when he died quite suddenly of an apoplectic fit on the night of 5 February 1799 while visiting the Earl of Effingham in Wimpole Street from his own residence in Han's Place, Pimlico. His encomium proceeds, > \\"he possessed a quickness of poetic genius, a celerity and precision of > thought, and a comprehension of mind, which excited the admiration of all > who knew him. There was no subject, be it ever so abstruse, which that did > not in an instant strike upon his understanding with its full elucidation. > As a botanist, he was complete without having ever appeared to study a > single plant.

The variety was originally grown in the Vuelta Abajo region of Cuba but is today grown exclusively in the Jamastran valley of Honduras and in the United States in Western Kentucky. Black Patch Cigar Co. Founder Eric McAnallen is having the Kentucky propagated Corojo, Kenbano seed planted for the 2011/2012 Dominican harvest after successfully growing this tobacco varietal in Western Kentucky since 2007. Two different growing areas, soil \\"signatures\\" in the Cibao valley have been identified for cultivation. The two areas where the Kenbano seed is being raised are Pinuela and Navarrete. The Navarrete soil matrix mirrors the soil of Vuelta Abajo, Cuba. Historically Navarrete has been ideal for Cuban heirloom seed success in the Dominican Republic. Pinuela has similar success with a soil analysis comparable to Pinar, Cuba. These soil components produce a robust growth in leaf yield per stalk and exhibit a peppery spice in flavor. History=Origin Corojo was originally developed and grown by Diego Rodriguez at his farm or vega, Santa Ines del Corojo and takes its name from the farm, which was located near the town of San Luis in the province of Pinar del Rio, Cuba. Daniel Maria Rodriguez, son of Diego Rodriguez, later perfected the variety Corojo and developed the \\"Worlds Best Wrapper\\" until the Communist revolution of Fidel Castro caused the family to leave the country forever. It was Daniel Maria Rodriguez's extreme attention to detail and high level of supervision throughout the entire growing, curing and grading process of the wrapper which led to his success. Corojo wrapper was so highly prized that it stood alone on a global level due mostly to the attention given to it by Daniel Maria Rodriguez. Corojo wrapper at the time sold 3-4 times more expensive than other wrappers. Daniel Rodriguez & Diego Rodriguez, sons of Daniel Maria Rodriguez, later grew the shade tobacco variety in Havana, Florida and in Nicaragua. Daniel Rodriguez also has two sons, Daniel Antonio Rodriguez and Diego Rene Rodriguez, Diego Rodriguez has two sons, Diego Daniel Rodriguez and Daniel Jose Rodriguez. While the family never grew tobacco again Daniel Rodriguez and Diego Rodriguez went on to grow Limes, Avocados, Mangoes, and Mamey in South Florida. Today the family owns a large produce business; growing, packing, and shipping produce nationwide. \\"What‚Äôs So Special About Cuban Corojo Cigar Wrappers?\\" Cigar Envy, July 5, 2006. Corojo was used extensively as a wrapper for many years on Cuban cigars, with the tobacco's spicy \\"punch\\" becoming a commonly associated trademark of the country's tobacco products. Indeed, between the 1930s and the 1990s all Cuban cigars, regardless of brand or factory, made use of Corojo wrappers. However, the variety's susceptibility to various diseases, including blue mold and black shank disease caused Cuban agronomists to search for a more hearty and reliable alternative.Mark Bernardo, A Tale of Two Seeds , Smoke Magazine, Spring, 2004 issue (vol. 9, issue 2). Cuban genetic engineers ultimately developed various hybrid forms that would not only be disease-resistant, but would also display excellent wrapper qualities. Today no pure Corojo is grown in Cuba, the last harvest taking place there during the 1996/97 agricultural year. Use of Corojo today Today, both hybrid and pure strains of Corojo are used in the production of cigars. Most of the pure Corojo leaf is currently grown in Honduras' Jamastran Valley, while the hybrid varieties are more widely grown and used. Recently, pure Corojo seed has been propagated in Western Kentucky as the F1 generation Kenbano tobacco in 2007. Currently the so-called \\"Kenbano\\" tobacco seed is being raised for future production of hand-made cigar blends.

Playing career Born in Birchover,Matlock Town pen pics Derbyshire, Shimwell was a trainee with Sheffield United in 1939, but failed to break into the first team before the outbreak of World War II. In 1943‚Äì44, he made 15 guest appearances for Southampton. Shimwell began his professional career with Sheffield United in 1946, but on 20 December he made the move to the club with which he made his name, Blackpool. The Blades had refused Shimwell permission to run a pub ‚Äî the Plough Inn, in Two Dales ‚Äî which prompted him to put in a transfer request.Calley, Roy (1992). Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887‚Äì1992, p. 114 Blackpool manager Joe Smith jumped in to sign the full-back for ¬£7,000. His debut for Blackpool was supposed to be against Charlton Athletic, the day after his signing, but it was put back after his train got stuck in snow, which meant he did not arrive at The Valley until half-time. His first game came four days later, on Christmas Day, against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. He replaced Eric Sibley, and from that moment he made the right-back position his own. Shimwell scored two important FA Cup goals for Blackpool; the first, against Chester City on 24 January 1948, was a 60-yard lob, the combination of a following wind and frozen pitch saw it bounce over the goalkeeper's head. Blackpool reached that year's final, in which they met eventual victors Manchester United, and Shimwell became the first full-back to score in such a Wembley event when his 12th-minute penalty gave Blackpool the lead. Shimwell played in two more FA Cup Finals with Blackpool, firstly in 1951 against Newcastle United (in which they were on the losing side again, thanks to a Jackie Milburn double), and then in 1953, the famous \\"Matthews Final\\" Blackpool victory. On 13 May 1949, at the age of 29, Shimwell gained his only England cap, against Sweden.EnglandStats.com A dislocated shoulder, suffered in a win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Bloomfield Road on 17 September 1955, meant Shimwell was out for the rest of the season. Indeed, he made only one more start for the Seasiders, on 19 January 1957, at home to Sunderland, but it gave the Blackpool faithful amongst the 18,702 present the chance to say farewell to the defender after thirteen years of service. In May, Shimwell was given a free transfer to Third Division Oldham Athletic. He played only seven games for the club before joining Burton Albion as player-manager. He finished his playing career while at Matlock Town in 1960. Retirement After hanging up his boots, Shimwell became licensee at The Royal Volunteer, a pub in Clay Cross, Derbyshire. He was also the licensee of the Plough Inn, Two Dales, and later of the Duke of Wellington, Matlock. Shimwell died in 1988 at the age of 68.

It is also spoken by many emigrants, who migrated from the Hadhramaut to the Horn of Africa (Somalia and Eritrea), East Africa (Comoros, Zanzibar, Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique), Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore) and, recently, to the other Arab states of the Persian Gulf.  Phonology  The dialect in many towns and villages in the WƒÅdƒ´ (valley) and the coastal region is characterised by its -yodization, changing the Classical Arabic reflex to the approximant . That resembles some Eastern Arabian and Gulf dialects, including the dialects of Basra in Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain other Arab Emirates. In educated speech, is realised as a voiced palatal plosive or affricate in some lexical items which are marked [+ religious] or [+ educated] (see below). The reflex is pronounced as a voiced velar in all lexical items throughout the dialect. In some other Arabic dialects, is realised as a voiceless uvular plosive in certain marked lexemes [+ religious], [+ educational]: ‚ÄúQur‚Äôan‚Äù. With the spread of literacy and contact with speakers of other Arabic dialects, future sociolinguistic research may reveal whether using the uvular in certain lexemes and retaining the velar for others will occur. Distinctions , , and , , are made in WƒÅdƒ´, but and are both pronounced . The Coast merges all the pairs into the stops , and (, and ), respectively. In non-emphatic environments, is realised as an open front (slightly raised) unrounded . Thus, \\"second,\\" which is normally realised with an -like quality in the Gulf dialects, is realised with an . The dialect is characterised by not allowing final consonant clusters to occur in final position. Thus, Classical Arabic \\"girl\\" is realised as . In initial positions, there is a difference between the WƒÅdƒ´ and the coastal varieties. The coast has initial clusters in \\"he wants,\\" \\"onions\\" and \\"mail (n.),\\" but WƒÅdƒ´ realises the second and third words as and , respectively.  Morphology  When the first person singular comes as an independent subject pronoun, it is marked for gender: for masculine and for feminine. As an object pronoun, it comes as a bound morpheme: for masculine and for feminine. The first person subject plural is na·∏•nƒÅ. The first person direct object plural is rather than the of many dialects. Thus, the cognate of the Classical Arabic \\"he hit us\\" is . Stem VI, tC1ƒÅC2aC3, can be umlauted to tC1ƒìC2aC3, thus changing the pattern vowel ƒÅ to ƒì. That leads to a semantic change, as in \\"they ran away suddenly\\" and \\"they shirk, try to escape.\\" Intensive and frequentative verbs are common in the dialect. Thus \\"to break\\" is intensified to , as in \\"he played rough.\\" It can be metathesized to become frequentative, as in \\"he made a series (lit. breaks) of giggles or laughs.\\"  Syntax  The syntax has many similarities to other Peninsular Arabic dialects. However, the dialect contains a number of unique particles used for co-ordination, negation, and other sentence types. Examples in coordination include \\"but, nevertheless, though,\\" (Classical Arabic ) \\"as for‚Ä¶,\\" and \\"or.\\" Like many other dialects, apophonic or ablaut passive (as in \\"it was written\\") is not very common, and Is mainly confined to clich√©s and proverbs from other dialects, including Classical Arabic. The particle developed semantically in the dialect to or \\"yet, already, almost, nearly\\" and or \\"maybe, perhaps.\\"  Vocabulary  There are a few lexical items that are shared with Modern South Arabian languages, which perhaps distinguish this dialect from other neighbouring Peninsular dialects. The effect of Hadhrami emigration to Southeast Asia (see Arab Indonesians and Arab Singaporeans), the Indian subcontinent and East Africa is clear in the vocabulary especially in certain registers like types of food and dress: \\"sarong.\\" Many loanwords are listed in al-Saqqaf (2006).

BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 4, BBC 5 Live, BBC 6 Music, BBC 1Xtra, BBC Asian Network, BBC World Service, BBC Radio Scotland and BBC Radio Wales all actively commission independently produced programming. Unlike the television sector, which has a legally guaranteed 25% share of the BBC's output (with an additional 25% open to competitive bidding), the radio sector has no such guarantee. The BBC chooses to voluntarily offer approximately 10% of its 'eligible' hours to independent production. This figure has not changed in over 13 years and both the BBC and the British Government refuse to alter the status quo. This has led to an unstable and uncertain sector with large numbers of companies pitching for small amounts of air-time. The Radio Independents Group is tasked with getting the voluntary 'quota' increased. Radio indies also produce many hours of programming for the Commercial Radio companies, such as chart shows, traffic & travel bulletins and entertainment news. However, unlike the BBC, the majority of this material is paid for by third party sponsors rather than by the radio stations. There is very little commissioned programming on UK commercial radio due to the cost of making such material and the low programming budgets of commercial radio stations. Radio Indies & The BBC Up until Dec 2004, when commissioning programs from independent producers, the BBC would purchase an 'all rights' deal. This meant that the independent producer retained no ownership or control over their product. Following negotiations between RIG and the BBC in 2004, the new Terms of Trade now in place have had a considerable positive effect for independent producers: * Indies now own their productions entirely * The BBC purchases a 10-year UK-only broadcast license consisting of 2 transmissions and audio-on- demand rights * Indies can now commercially exploit their productions both in the UK and internationally * Indies gain improved repeat rates and improved rates for repeats on BBC World Service and BFBS The BBC has a requirement written into the BBC Agreement , HM Government. BBC Agreement. The Stationery Office, Jul 2006 pp30-31, Clause 58. to commission a 'suitable proportion' of radio programming from independent producers, which it has set at 10% of 'eligible' hours (i.e. excluding news). In 2010 the BBC Trust published a report BBC Trust. Review of Radio Independent Supply. August 2010. requiring the BBC to operate an additional Window of Creative Competition, set at 10% of eligible hours, encompassing programming for which independents can compete against in-house producers. In June 2015 the BBC Director of Radio Helen Boaden announced the intention Press Release for Helen Boaden Speech to RIG AGM June 2015. as part of the BBC's 'Compete or Compare' initiative,Tony Hall Speech at City University - 10 July 2014. to put out 60% of eligible radio hours to competition from indie and in-house producers, a target to be reached over a six-year period. Radio Production Awards The RIG since 2010 has organized the Radio Production Awards, supported by the Radio Academy. The awards \\"recognise and celebrate the production skills of radio and audio producers based in the UK or supplying UK-based broadcasters from overseas.\\" Current Issues * BBC World Service - new Terms of Trade between the network and the independent sector * Update to the General BBC Terms of Trade * Update and continuation of BBC Worldwide BFBS contracts * Submission to the BBC Trust regarding the damage to indie's rights by the planned BBC Online/iPlayer proposal * Push for more opportunities and access to air-time for independent producers * Creation of standardised industry 'draft' contracts * Supporting the work of the Radio Academy and the Radio Industry Diversity Group * Training and resources for radio independents ReferencesExternal links * RIG Website * The Radio Academy Website * BBC Independent Commissioning Website Radio in the United Kingdom ","title":"Radio Independents Group"},{"id":"9631171","text":"Charles Harington may refer to: *Sir Charles Harington Harington (1872‚Äì1940), British Army general *Sir Charles Harington (chemist) (1897‚Äì1972), Welsh chemist *Sir Charles Harington (British Army officer, born 1910) (1910‚Äì2007), British Army general *Charles Richard Harington (born 1933), Canadian zoologist ","title":"Charles Harington"},{"id":"9631181","title":"Victor Espinoza"},{"id":"9631210","text":"South Ottawa Township is located in LaSalle County, Illinois.

In April 2014, a sports channel similar to TV4 Sport is launched as TV12 by the same company, replacing :sv:TV4 Sport Xtra. This channel was previously called TV4 Sport Xtra, with the name changed to TV4 Sport as TV12 was launched).  History  The channel was originally owned by Expressen who launched the channel on 17 March 2005. It was initially available in the analogue basic package from UPC cable, the digital \\"Medium\\" package from Com Hem and the \\"Family\\" package from Canal Digital on satellite. Sports rights used by the channel included matches from the football series Superettan and the Wimbledon. In May 2006, it was announced that TV4 AB bought a majority stake in the channel. The channel relaunched as \\"TV4 Sport-Expressen\\" with a new logo on 1 June. The deal meant that Sport-Expressen could use several sports rights held by TV4, including reruns of games from the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Another change was announced in May 2007. TV4 AB had increased their ownership 66.2 percent. This will see the channel relaunch in September as \\"TV4 Sport\\". With the relaunch, it will take the space in the Com Hem basic package previously occupied by Eurosport, thereby increasing the penetration for the channel while decreasing it for a major competitor. It will also get a slightly broader content by introducing series and documentaries related to sports. The change was successful in increasing the ratings for TV4 Sport. In April 2008, TV4 Sport passed Eurosport as the most watched sports channel in Sweden. In January 2008, the channel was launched on the Viasat satellite platform. By the end of March 2008, TV4 received a licence to broadcast the channel in the Swedish digital terrestrial television network. The licence was valid from 1 April, but it didn't launch immediately, partly due to a disagreement between TV4 and Boxer over the pricing of the channel. TV4 Sport was finally launched on 11 May 2008, after TV4 and Boxer had reached an agreement that would make the channel available until 30 September.

It is especially associated with Maasai morans (male warriors) who have traditionally used it in warfare and for hunting. It is a commonly encountered tourist souvenir in that part of the world. Rungus are typically about 45‚Äì50 cm (18‚Äì20 inches) in length with a long narrow shaft for a handle and heavy knob or ball at the end in the manner of other indigenous cudgels such as the Irish shillelagh or South African knobkierie. In Maasai culture, the rungu is an important emblem of warrior status for young males. A special one is held by the designated speaker at important tribal gatherings. Although utilitarian examples are made of simple hard wood, ceremonial rungus may be elaborately carved or made of other materials. Local women are widely employed in sewing decorative beads onto the handles of those made for the tourist trade. Former Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi was invariably seen at important public functions holding an elegant gold- or silver-tipped ivory rungu. He referred to it as his fimbo ya nyayo (Swahili, \\"Nyayo's staff- 'Nyayo' was a moniker that refers to President Moi\\") and would pound it on a table when angry, sometimes shattering the rungu.

Maloya is a new form that has origins in the music of African and Malagasy slaves and Indian indentured workers on the island, as has the other folk music of R√©union, s√©ga. World music journalists and non-specialist scholars sometimes compare maloya to the American music, the blues, though they have little in common. Unlike the blues, maloya was considered such a threat to the French state that in the 1970s it was banned. It is sometimes considered the Reunionese version of s√©ga. Description Compared to s√©ga, which employs numerous string and wind European instruments, traditional maloya uses only percussion and the musical bow. Maloya songs employ a call-response structure. Instruments Traditional instruments include: *roul√©r - a low-tuned barrel drum played with the hands *kayamb - a flat rattle made from sugar cane tubes and seeds *pik√©r - a bamboo idiophone played with sticks * sati - a flat metal idiophone played with sticks *bob - a braced, struck musical bow Themes Maloya songs are often politically oriented and their lyrical themes are often slavery and poverty. Origins The indigenous music and dance form of maloya was often presented as a style of purely African origin, linked ancestral rituals from Africa (\\"service Kaf\\" and Madagascar (the \\"servis kabar√©\\"), and as such a musical inheritance of the early slave population of the island. More recently, however, the possible influence of the sacred drumming of the Tamil religious rituals has been introduced by Dany√®l Waro, which makes Maloya' heterogeneous African Malagasy and Indian influences more explicit. History Maloya was banned until the sixties because of its strong association with creole culture. Performances by some maloya groups were banned until the eighties, partly because of their autonomist beliefs and association with the Communist Party of R√©union Nowadays, one of the most famous maloya musicians is Dany√®l Waro. His mentor, Firmin Viry, is credited as having rescued maloya from extinction. According to Fran√ßoise Verg√®s, the first public performance of maloya was by Firmin Viry in 1959 at the founding of the Communist PartyFrancoise Verges, Monsters and Revolutionaries, pp.309‚Äì10, n.3 Maloya was adopted as a medium for political and social protest by Creole poets such as Waro, and later by groups such as Ziskakan. Since the start of the 1980s, maloya groups, such as Ziskakan, Baster, Firmin Viry, Granmoun Baba, Rwa Kaff and Ti Fock, some mixing maloya with other genres such as s√©ga, zouk, reggae, samba, afrobeat, jazz and rock, have had recognition outside the island. Cultural significance Maloya was inscribed in 2009 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO for France. This musical form was the subject of a 1994 documentary film by Jean Paul Roig, entitled Maloya Dousman.

It was protected against inundations from this lake by a mound or dyke, raised by the inhabitants of Caphyae. The city is said to have been founded by King Cepheus of Tegea, the son of Aleus, and pretended to be of Athenian origin.Pausanias. Description of Greece, viii. 23. ¬ß 2; Strabo. Geography, xiii. p. 608. Caphyae subsequently belonged to the Achaean League, and was one of the cities of the league, of which Cleomenes III obtained possession.Polybius, ii. 52. In its neighborhood a great battle was fought in 220 BC, in which the Aetolians, gained a decisive victory over the Achaeans and Aratus of Sicyon.Polybius, iv. 11, seq. The name of Caphyae also occurs in the subsequent events of this war.Polybius, iv. 68, 70. Strabo speaks of the town as in ruins in his time; but it still contained some temples when visited by Pausanias (l. c.).Strabo. Geography, viii. p. 388. The remains of the walls of Caphyae are visible upon a small insulated height at the village of Chotoussa, which stands near the edge of the lake. Polybius, in his description of the battle of Caphyae, refers to a plain in front of Caphyae, traversed by a river, beyond which were trenches (), a description of the place which does not correspond with present appearances. The were evidently ditches for the purpose of draining the marshy plain, by conducting the water towards the Katav√≥thra, around which there was, probably, a small lake. In the time of Pausanias we find that the lake covered the greater part of the plain; and that exactly in the situation in which Polybius describes the ditches, there was a mound of earth. It is probable that during the four centuries that elapsed between the battle of Caphyae and the visit of Pausanias, a diminution of population should have caused a neglect of the drainage which had formerly ensured the cultivation of the whole plain, and that in the time of the Roman Empire an embankment of earth had been thrown up to preserve the part nearest to Caphyae, leaving the rest uncultivated and marshy. Pausanias says that on the inner side of the embankment there flows a river, which, descending into a chasm of the earth, issues again at a place called Nasi (); and that the name of the village where it issues is named Rheunus (). From this place it forms the perennial river Tragus () (modern Tara or Daraiiko). He also speaks of a mountain named Cnacalos () (modern Kastania) in the neighbourhood of the city, on which the inhabitants celebrate a yearly festival to Artemis Cnacalesia.Leake, Morea, vol. iii. p. 118, seq., Peloponnesiaca, p. 226; Boblaye, Recherches, p. 150.

The ending date was approximated to be late 2008 or early 2009; however, the housing crisis of the late 2000s halted the project. The project was revived as The Towers by Foster + Partners in 2016, after FAA approval of supertall heights (>1,000 ft). History The complex was to feature two twin towers, Villa Magna Condominiums I and Villa Magna Condominiums II. Both were to be tall with 57 floors.

The buildings were planned be used entirely for residential purposes, with the complex containing 780 condominium units. However, in 2007 the developers changed the plans to include more hotel, retail, and commercial space in realization of the quickly declining housing market at the time. The complex was then approved under a major use special permit. Revival In 2011, the project plans were rumored to have been revived. In 2015, the height of the project was approved up to .

David and Mary (Evarts) Greene, and was born February 11, 1843, at Roxbury, Massachusetts. Immediately after graduating, he went to Palmyra, Wisconsin, where he taught school until June 1865, at which time he removed to Waukegan, Illinois, where he taught for one year. In the Fall of 1866, having decided to study for the ministry, he entered the Chicago Theological Seminary, where he remained for one year. From April to June 1867, he taught at Lake Forest Academy in Lake Forest, Illinois, before returning to New England. He then went to the Andover Theological Seminary, where he continued his studies until he graduated in July 1869. In November 1869, he sailed for Japan, as a missionary under the auspices of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. He was the first missionary of the American Board to Japan. He arrived at Tokyo in December 1869, and remained there until March 1870, when he went to Kobe, where he resided and labored until May 1874. The first church was organized at Kobe on April 19, 1874, with eleven members. In 1882 there were nineteen churches with one thousand members. From June 1874, until May 1880, he resided in Yokohama, as a member of the committee for the translation of the New Testament into the Japanese language. After superintending the printing of this version, which was published in June 1880, he returned to the United States, where he spent about eighteen months, traveling through different parts of the country, and preaching in the interests of the American Board. He returned to Japan in November 1881, and was stationed in Kyoto, as an instructor in the Doshisha English School, his principal work being in the Theological Department. In addition to the Japanese version above alluded to, he also edited an edition of the Chinese New Testament, for the use of Japanese readers. He received the degree of Master of Arts from Dartmouth College in course, and also the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Rutgers College in 1879. In politics, he was an independent Republican. He was married July 29, 1869, to Miss Mary Jane Forbes, of Westborough, Massachusetts. They have seven children: Evarts Boutell, born July 8, 1870; Fannie Bradley, born August 29, 1871; Daniel Crosby, born January 29, 1873; Jerome Davis, born October 12, 1874; Mary Avery, born February 20, 1877; Roger Sherman, born May 29, 1881, Elisabeth Grosvenor, born October 20, 1882 and Edward Forbes, born December 22, 1884.

He was a right-handed pitcher over parts of ten seasons (1881‚Äì1890) with the Boston Red Caps/Beaneaters, Kansas City Cowboys, Washington Nationals, Indianapolis Hoosiers and Philadelphia Athletics (AA). He was the National League strikeout champion in 1883 with the Boston Beaneaters. Early life Whitney was born in Conklin, New York, and he had a brother named Charlie with whom he played baseball. When the brothers played on the same teams, each could serve as a pitcher or a catcher, so one sibling was often pitching to the other. Charlie Whitney played independent professional baseball. Career Playing with the semi-pro Binghamton Crickets before minor league stints in Oswego, New York, Omaha, and San Francisco, Whitney debuted in the major leagues for Harry Wright's 1881 Boston Red Caps, and he worked hard that season, throwing 57 complete games and pitching 552 innings that year. A Boston journalist called Whitney \\"the swiftest pitcher in the league\\". Some accounts describe that Whitney was disliked by umpires, who said that he would spend much of the game complaining about calls that did not go in his favor. Whitney had unique pitching mechanics. In 19th century baseball, the ball was delivered from a rectangular pitcher's box six feet in length. Pitchers would sometimes hop forward within the box before releasing the ball, and some would leap into the air during the process. Batters made fun of Whitney when he did this, giving him the nickname \\"Grasshopper Jim\\", but Whitney's pitching was effective for several years. For his career, he compiled a 191‚Äì204 record in 413 appearances, with a 2.97 ERA and 1,571 strikeouts. During his five seasons with the Boston franchise (now the Atlanta Braves), he ranks 4th in franchise history in ERA (2.49), 3rd in WHIP (1.082), 9th in innings pitched (2263), 8th in strikeouts (1157), 9th in games started (254), 4th in complete games (242), 1st in strikeout to walk ratio (5.03), 7th in losses (121), and 2nd in wild pitches (162). Death Whitney died in 1891 in Binghamton, New York, at the home of his father, Rufus Whitney. Tuberculosis was the cause of death.

Mutations in ILK are associated with cardiomyopathies . It is a 59kDa protein originally identified in a yeast-two hybrid screen with integrin Œ≤1 as the bait protein. Since its discovery, ILK has been associated with multiple cellular functions including cell migration, proliferation, and adhesion. Integrin-linked kinases (ILKs) are a subfamily of Raf-like kinases (RAF). The structure of ILK consists of three features: 5 ankyrin repeats in the N-terminus, Phosphoinositide binding motif and extreme N-terminus of kinase catalytic domain. Integrins lack enzymatic activity and depend on adapters to signal proteins. ILK is linked to beta-1 and beta-3 integrin cytoplasmic domains and is one of the best described integrins. Although first described as a serine/threonine kinase by Hannigan, important motifs of ILK kinases are still uncharacterized. ILK is thought to have a role in development regulation and tissue homeostasis, however it was found that in flies, worms and mice ILK activity isn‚Äôt required to regulate these processes. Animal ILKs have been linked to the pinch- parvin complex which control muscle development. Mice lacking ILK were embryonic lethal due to lack of organized muscle cell development. In mammals ILK lacks catalytic activity but supports scaffolding protein functions for focal adhesions. In plants, ILKs signal complexes to focal adhesion sites. ILKs of plants contain multiple ILK genes. Unlike animals that contain few ILK genes ILKs have been found to possess oncogenic properties. ILKs control the activity of serine/threonine phosphatases.  Principle Features  Transduction of extracellular matrix signals through integrins influences intracellular and extracellular functions, and appears to require interaction of integrin cytoplasmic domains with cellular proteins. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK), interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of beta-1 integrin. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. Recent results showed that the C-terminal kinase domain is actually a pseudo-kinase with adaptor function. In 2008, ILK was found to localize to the centrosome and regulate mitotic spindle organization. Integrin-linked kinase has been shown to interact with: * ACP6, * AKT1, * ILKAP, and * LIMS1,  Function of Plant ILK1  ILKs function by interacting with the many transmembrane receptors to regulate different signaling cascades. ILK1 has been found in the root system of most plants where they are co-localized on the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum where they transport ions across the plasma membrane ILK1 is responsible for the control of osmotic and salt stress, control of the uptake of nutrients based on availability and pathogen detection.  Osmotic and salt stress  ILK1 is linked to hyperosmotic stress sensitivity. ILK1 reduced salt stress in seedlings placed in solution with increased concentrations of salt. ILK1 concentrations remain fairly constant throughout development regardless of a high salt exposure. Previously, it was believed that K+ accumulation was reduced in increased salt concentration. K+ homeostasis is not affected in high salt concentrations. During periods of high salt stress, K+ concentrations in the presence of ILK1 was maintained at the existing level. Potassium transport is required for flg22 root growth inhibition and potassium transport was affected by flg22. Potassium levels modulate the activation of flg22, a flagellin peptide composed of 22 amino acids that triggers pathogen- associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs functions by activating regulators of bacterial pathogen alert system. Ion concentration levels of Mn2+, Mg2+, S and Ca2+ were also affected after PAMP regulators were mobilized.  Nutrient uptake  Potassium (K+) is responsible for osmoregulation, membrane potential maintenance and turgor pressure of plant cells which in turn mediates stomata movement and growth of tubules within the plant. Photosynthesis and other metabolic pathways are controlled by potassium. When sufficient K+ uptake is not met, PAMPs are activated. Calmodulins, specifically CML9, have appeared as important genes to interact with ILK1 and regulate potassium levels within the cell. While CLM9 primarily regulates Ca2+ it is linked to a yet identified K+/Ca2+ influx channel. While interactions are known to occur between CML9 and ILK1, ILK1 Is not a direct phosphorylation target of CML9. With the addition of CML9, autophosphorylation of ILK1 is diminished, the present irrespective of calcium available for uptake. A) Full length protein sequence of Arabidopsis. B) 3D structures of ILK repeats. C) N-terminal is blue C-terminal is red. Shows the succession of secondary elements. D) Amino acid sequence of ILK. ILK1 is also affected by presence or absence of manganese (Mn2+). Autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation occurred when exposed to both Mn2+ and Mg2+. Mn2+ and was dose dependent where Mg2+ was not. Specific ILK autophosphorylation sites were found in the presence of Mn2+ but not in the presence of Mg2+ which supports the ILK1 dependent phosphorylation suggested above. Mass spectrometry revealed no other kinases were present to trigger this response.  Pathogen detection  ILK1 has been found to promote resistance in bacterial pathogens. ILK1 is required for flg22 sensitivity in seedlings. A catalytically inactive version of ILK1 was compared with catalytically active versions of ILK1 to see the level of resistance when challenged with bacterial pathogens. Plants inoculated with inactive ILK1 were more susceptible to bacterial infection than active ILK1 suggesting that ILK1 is needed for bacterial pathogen detection. While ILK1 is involved in bacterial pathogen detection it is not used for effect induced defenses. ILK1 increases PAMP response and basal immunity through phosphorylation of MPK3 and MPK6 and operates independently in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. High Affinity Potassium uptake mediators such as HAK5 have also been found to be integral in the signaling of flg22. HAK5 function when potassium levels are low. Flg22 has been shown to depolarize the cell‚Äôs plasma membrane with HAK5 and ILK1 working together to mediate ion homeostasis to assist with both short and long term actions such as growth and suppression thereof.

Founded as a girls' senior school in 1893, the college now educates girls from ages 2 to 18 and boys up to age 11. It is a member of the Girls' Schools Association and Allied Schools.  History  In the 1880s, the original Harrogate College was a boys' school. The need for a girls' school in the area soon became obvious and opened in 1893. Over the years, the newly opened girls' school flourished while the boys' school was eventually closed. In 1904, the girls' school moved into the present accommodation located across the street from St Wilfrid's Church. From 1939 to 1945, the school was evacuated to Swinton Park, and after the Second World War moved back. Additional extensions that housed a library, a science block and a gymnasium were built later in the 1950s. Later, more buildings were constructed (a sports hall in the 1980s, an art room, and the Highfield Prep School). Gradually, houses on each side of Clarence Drive were acquired and were used as boarding houses. The pre-prep department, known as Bankfield, was opened in 1997, whilst the junior school, Highfield, opened in 1999. Currently, the grounds, playing field, tennis courts, houses and gardens occupy about of the Duchy Estate.History The college now consists of three divisions: Highfield Pre-School (boys and girls aged 2‚Äì4), Highfield Prep (boys and girls aged 4‚Äì11) and the main school (day and boarding girls aged 11‚Äì18). Pastoral Care As a Christian school, pupils are encouraged to attend chapel services but welcomes pupils of \\"all faiths or none\\". The school has links with the local parish church St Wilfrid's Church. A school chaplain oversees pastoral care and spiritual aspects of the school curriculum.Chapel House System Upon entry, pupils are placed into one of the four houses. Over the school year, the houses will compete in inter-house competitions. =Highfield= The junior school houses are named after four of the Yorkshire Dales. *Nidderdale *Wharfedale *Wensleydale *Swaledale =Senior School= The senior school houses are separate from boarding houses. They are named after prominent British female figures in history. *Austen *Franklin *Nightingale *Pankhurst Boarding The school has a long boarding tradition and over half of senior school pupils are boarders. Full or flexible boarding is available to girls aged 10 and above. There are five boarding houses: Armaclare, Clarence, Lancaster, Lincoln, or Tower. The first four are situated in the heart of the campus. Tower House, which is similar to a university hall of residence and houses Upper Sixth girls, is located further away from the main school. Each house is overseen by a housemistress and full-time residential staff who look after boarders during after-school hours.Boarding Notable former pupils * Anne McIntosh, politician * Claire King, actress * Sheila Burnford, author * Juliet Bremner, TV reporter * Laura Winwood, ex- president of Oxford Union * Genevieve Barr, actress * Jane Carr (Rita Brunstrom), actress ReferencesExternal links *Harrogate Ladies' College *Yorkshirenet *ISI Inspection Report *Profile on MyDaughter Educational institutions established in 1893 Girls' schools in North Yorkshire Schools in Harrogate Independent schools in North Yorkshire Member schools of the Girls' Schools Association 1893 establishments in England Boarding schools in North Yorkshire * ","title":"Harrogate Ladies' College"},{"id":"9631739","text":"Pittosporum tenuifolium is a small evergreen tree ‚Äì up to ‚Äì commonly known as k≈çh≈´h≈´ and black matipo, and by other MƒÅori names kohukohu and tawhiwhi.

The midrib of the leaf and its smaller lateral veins are whiteish and quite visible on the upper side of the leaf. K≈çh≈´h≈´ has small ‚Äì around 1 cm in diameter ‚Äì dark coloured flowers. The colour ranges from dark-red to dark-purple turning almost black as the flowers age. On rare occasions, the colour can be red or yellow. The flowers develop from lateral buds, either individually or in clumps, and can be male or bisexual. The flowers are filled with nectar and exude a honey scented fragrance in the evenings with the scent being more obvious in slightly damp conditions. This attracts moths and night flying insects, and it is believed these insects help with pollination. Fertilised flowers develop into small ‚Äì around 1.2 cm in diameter ‚Äì globe shaped fruits. The fruit is covered in a small layer of hairs during early maturation that is progressively discarded as the capsule ripens. In the ripening process the capsule shrinks, hardens up and turns almost black, splitting into two or three segments when ripened. Inside are black seeds, encased in a very sticky substance. The stickiness of the seeds is likely to help with seed dispersal.

New Zealand range  K≈çh≈´h≈´ is well spread all over New Zealand, being absent only to the west of the Southern Alps and Stewart Island.  Habitat preferences  K≈çh≈´h≈´ is found growing wild in coastal and lower mountain forest areas up to an altitude of 900 m. K≈çh≈´h≈´ grows particularly quickly at forest edges located at the bottom of high terraces, and can also be found growing in riverbeds. It grows readily in forested areas that have been disturbed or in reverting farmland, playing an important role in ecological succession. Life cycle/Phenology The capsule of K≈çh≈´h≈´, showing the black seeds encased in a sticky substance Most of the plants in the genus Pittosporum are easily propagated from seed, but germination may be slow. In horticultural production, the sticky substance coating the seeds is removed before sowing, as it acts as a germination inhibitor. The seeds are treated to simulate natural conditions for six weeks in order to improve germination rates. K≈çh≈´h≈´ is a relatively fast growing plant growing from 0.5 metres to 3 metres within five years. The root system is shallow and spread out. These characteristics make it ideal ‚Äì when used in conjunction with another plants ‚Äì for use in stream stabilisation and erosion control. Flowering happens in late spring, from October to November, and the maturation of the fruit happens between mid- summer and autumn, from January to March. The seedlings of k≈çh≈´h≈´ are unusual, as in some cases they have three or four seed leaves instead of the usual two. Diet and foraging K≈çh≈´h≈´ is a hardy plant that can cope with poor conditions ‚Äì poor soils, droughts and windy environments. It is, however, a light-demanding plant and prefers soils with good drainage in humid climates. Planting it in damp conditions can cause winter leaf dropn, which likely explains why k≈çh≈´h≈´ is not found growing on the West Coast of New Zealand. In its role in ecological succession, k≈çh≈´h≈´ is often found at an earlier stage than its relative lemonwood (another endemic Pittosporum), and usually inhabits less fertile soils. Predators, Parasites, and Diseases= Insects  The small, dark flower of K≈çh≈´h≈´ There are over 50 insect species listed in the Plant-SyNZ database that either feed on or parasitise k≈çh≈´h≈´ ‚Äì wasps, sucking bugs, flies, moths, butterflies, thrips, mites and beetles. There are also more than a dozen beetles that feed on the dead plant material. Below are some species of interest, organised by feeding habits: Pittosporum flower weevil ‚Äì Aneuma rubricale ‚Äì, a native insect, lays its eggs on the flower of k≈çh≈´h≈´; interestingly, only k≈çh≈´h≈´ is chosen for this, even if the weevil feeds on other types of Pittosporum. As soon as the weevil‚Äôs larvae hatch, they start feeding on the stamens and ovaries of the flowers, switching to the leaves once they reach adulthood. An arrival from Australia, pittosporum shield bug ‚Äì Monteithiella humeralis ‚Äì as well as the endemic pittosporum psyllid ‚Äì Trioza vitreoradiata ‚Äì feed only on Pittosporum species, by attaching themselves to a suitable part of the plant and feeding on its sap. The psyllid leaves a trail of characteristic ‚Äúbeads‚Äù behind. Cottony cushion scale ‚Äì Icerya purchase ‚Äì, an Australian bug, soft wax scale ‚Äì Ceroplastes destructor ‚Äì, an import from overseas and the Australian green shield bug ‚Äì Glaucias amyoti ‚Äì, native to New Zealand despite its name also parasitise the Pittosporum species, but have a more varied range of hosts. All attach themselves to a suitable part of the plant and feed on its sap. New Zealand flower thrips ‚Äì Thrips obscuratus ‚Äì feeds on leaves, flowers and young fruit of k≈çh≈´h≈´, by piercing plant cells and sucking their contents.  Fungi  Pythium irregulare has been recorded as a pathogen of k≈çh≈´h≈´, causing foliar blight, rot, and eventually death. A recently discovered pathogen of k≈çh≈´h≈´ that caused swelling of twigs ‚Äì the fungus Elsinoe takoropuku ‚Äì turned out to be a newly discovered species of fungi. The fungus was, so far, only found in association with k≈çh≈´h≈´. Cultural uses= Garden plant  K≈çh≈´h≈´ tree with a close-up of a branch. Note the undulated leaves and black branches. K≈çh≈´h≈´ is a popular garden plant in New Zealand and overseas, often used a hedge or as visual backdrop. It is sometimes grown under the cultivar name 'Nigricans', so called because of its black stems. In horticulture it is valued for its coloured foliage (cultivated variations include purple, \\"silver\\" and variegated leaves), and for its tolerance of some horticulturally difficult growing conditions, including dry soils and shade (although in northwest Europe, cold and exposed situations do not suit it). Several hybrids and cultivars have been developed and five varieties won the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit due to their ability to cope in the growing conditions of the United Kingdom: *'Garnettii' *'Irene Paterson' *'Silver Queen' *'Tom Thumb' *'Warnham Gold'  Host of threatened wood rose  The structure formed by the threatened root parasite wood rose. K≈çh≈´h≈´ has the potential to be used as the host of the threatened root parasite plant wood rose ‚Äì Dactylanthus taylorii. Wood rose was recently successfully translocated and sown in the wild from seed, showing the largest success rate when planted in association with k≈çh≈´h≈´.  Use by MƒÅori  There are several recorded uses of k≈çh≈´h≈´ by MƒÅori. The resin and oils extracted from the leaves were used for their scent and were often mixed with ingredients sourced from other native trees in order to produce an oil of variable composition. The resin was obtained by making cuts in the bark of the tree and the leaves were crushed and mixed with other oils. The oil was used to scent little pouches or a dead bird skin, often worn around the neck. The oil was also used to scent houses and mats of people of high rank. In addition, k≈çh≈´h≈´ was also used for medicinal purposes by MƒÅori. The resin was mixed with other gums and chewed as a cure for bad breath and sores in the mouth. Parts of the plants were used as topical treatment for relief of the symptoms of skin diseases. Crushed leaves were also used as a poultice for ulcers. The crushed bark was soaked in water and the resulting mixture used to treat breast or chest ailments, and the remaining liquid could be taken orally. It was used, together with flax root, to make a brew used to treat fever, bleeding and bruising. Validating its traditional uses as a medicine, a 2010 study indicated that k≈çh≈´h≈´ does indeed possess some antimicrobial properties. Lastly, the branches of k≈çh≈´h≈´ were used in important MƒÅori life ceremonies, such as baptisms, and are still used for welcoming visitors to a marae. Two of its common names, tƒÅwhiri (‚Äúto wave to‚Äù) and rautƒÅwhiri (‚Äúto wave a leaf‚Äù) reflect this.

She is best known for her love affair with the poet Mihai Eminescu, one of the most important Romanian writers. Biography Born in Nasz√≥d, Kingdom of Hungary (now NƒÉsƒÉud, Bistri»õa-NƒÉsƒÉud County, Romania), Micle was the second child of the shoemaker Ilie C√¢mpeanu and his wife Ana. She was born to him posthumously: Ilie died in 1849, taking two bullets to the chest while fighting under Avram Iancu against the Hungarian revolutionaries. Her mother went to Moldavia, settling in T√¢rgu Neam»õ in 1850, then to Roman, and finally in Ia»ôi in 1853. Ana went to primary school (during which time she began using the name Veronica) and to the Ia»ôi Central School for Girls, which she graduated in June 1863. Her graduation exam proctor was the Rector of the University of Ia»ôi, Professor »òtefan Micle. They fell in love and on 7 August 1864, at Bob Church, in Cluj (at the time, Kolozsv√°r), she married Micle, thirty years her senior. She had two daughters: Virginia, a poet who married Eduard Gruber, and Valeria, an opera singer who used the name Hilda professionally. In March 1872, in Vienna, she met Eminescu, beginning a relationship that would last for the rest of their lives. At first he would visit the literary salon that she hosted. Their friendship had become love sometime between 1875, when they started dedicating poems to each other, and 1878 (sources vary). Their romance went through several ups and downs--for instance, Eminescu left for Bucharest in 1877 to edit Timpul and that year Micle published poems in which she expressed her sadness at being left behind. Her husband died in 1879, leaving her rather poor. She came to Bucharest to seek a pension and Eminescu publicly called her his fianc√©e, but further stresses intervened (including a stillborn child in May 1880) and while he took up the subject again in 1881, he was diagnosed with syphilis in 1883. In 1887, she moved to Bucharest in an effort to keep up Eminescu's spirits. After his death in June 1889, she retired to VƒÉratec Monastery, where she put together a volume called Dragoste »ôi Poezie (Love and Poetry), in which she included poems of her own and those of Eminescu dedicated to her, to which she added commentary. A shaken Micle took arsenic not two months after Eminescu's death. She is buried on the monastery grounds, in VƒÉratec village. Her house in T√¢rgu Neam»õ, given to her by her parents as a wedding dowry and which she donated to the monastery in 1886, is now a museum. Literary activity Micle made her publishing debut in Noul Curier Rom√¢n (NCR) in 1872, with two romantic sketches published under the pen-name Corina. She published her poems, influenced by Eminescu, in Columna Lui Traian in 1874 and in Convorbiri Literare the following year. She also contributed to Familia (from 1879), Revista NouƒÉ and Revista LiterarƒÉ. Additionally, a volume containing 93 of Eminescu's letters to Micle and 15 of her replies was published in 2000.

It is a metalloenzyme with many isoforms, of which the most studied type is C. It catalyzes the oxidation of various organic substrates by hydrogen peroxide.  Structure  The structure of the enzyme was first solved by X-ray crystallography in 1997; and has since been solved several times with various substrates. It is a large alpha- helical protein which binds heme as a redox cofactor.  Substrates  Alone, the HRP enzyme, or conjugates thereof, is of little value; its presence must be made visible using a substrate that, when oxidized by HRP using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizing agent, yields a characteristic color change that is detectable by spectrophotometric methods. Numerous substrates for horseradish peroxidase have been described and commercialized to exploit the desirable features of HRP. These substrates fall into several distinct categories. HRP catalyzes the conversion of chromogenic substrates (e.g., TMB, DAB, ABTS) into colored products, and produces light when acting on chemiluminescent substrates (e.g. Enhanced Chemiluminescence by luminol). Some of the most common HRP chromogenic substrates. Luminol is the exception, as it is not a chromophore and light is generated after the HRP-catalyzed reaction.  Applications  Horseradish peroxidase is a 44,173.9-dalton glycoprotein with 6 lysine residues which can be conjugated to a labeled molecule. It produces a coloured, fluorimetric, or luminescent derivative of the labeled molecule when incubated with a proper substrate, allowing it to be detected and quantified. HRP is often used in conjugates (molecules that have been joined genetically or chemically) to determine the presence of a molecular target. For example, an antibody conjugated to HRP may be used to detect a small amount of a specific protein in a western blot. Here, the antibody provides the specificity to locate the protein of interest, and the HRP enzyme, in the presence of a substrate, produces a detectable signal. Horseradish peroxidase is also commonly used in techniques such as ELISA and Immunohistochemistry due to its monomeric nature and the ease with which it produces coloured products. Peroxidase, a heme-containing oxidoreductase, is a commercially important enzyme which catalyses the reductive cleavage of hydrogen peroxide by an electron donor. Horseradish peroxidase is ideal in many respects for these applications because it is smaller, more stable, and less expensive than other popular alternatives such as alkaline phosphatase. It also has a high turnover rate that allows generation of strong signals in a relatively short time span. High concentrations of phosphate severely decrease stability of horseradish peroxidase. In addition to biomedical applications, horseradish peroxidase is one of the enzymes with important environmental applications. This enzyme is suitable for the removal of hydroxylated aromatic compounds (HACs) that are considered to be primary pollutants in a wide variety of industrial wastewater. Moreover, \\"In recent years the technique of marking neurons with the enzyme horseradish peroxidase has become a major tool. In its brief history, this method has probably been used by more neurobiologists than have used the Golgi stain since its discovery in 1870.\\"  Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)  Horseradish peroxidase catalyses the oxidation of luminol to 3-aminophthalate via several intermediates. The reaction is accompanied by emission of low-intensity light at 428 nm. However, in the presence of certain chemicals, the light emitted is enhanced up to 1000-fold, making the light easier to detect and increasing the sensitivity of the reaction. The enhancement of light emission is called enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Several enhancers can be used such as the commonly known modified phenols (mainly iodo-phenol). However, there are several substrates on the market that use other enhancers which result in luminescence signals up to 13 times greater than phenol-enhanced substrates.High Intensity HRP-Chemiluminescence ELISA Substrate . Haemoscan.com (2016-02-11). Retrieved on 2016-03-29. The intensity of light is a measure of the number of enzyme molecules reacting and thus of the amount of hybrid. ECL is simple to set up and is sensitive, detecting about 0.5 pg nucleic acid in Southern blots and in northern blots. Detection by chemiluminescent substrates has several advantages over chromogenic substrates. The sensitivity is 10- to 100-fold greater, and quantifying of light emission is possible over a wide dynamic range, whereas that for coloured precipitates is much more limited, about one order of magnitude less. Stripping filters are much easier when chemiluminescent substrates are used.  HRP mimics  Many materials have been explored to mimic natural HRP. For example, iron oxide nanoparticles and hemin-containing complexes have been used to mimic HRP. These HRP-like artificial enzymes have been used for many applications, ranging from biomarker detection and tumor immunostaining to antibiofouling.

He is depicted in the Smaller Abu Simbel temple, dedicated to Nefertari. Inscriptions at Karnak and elsewhere show Nefertari was his mother. He visited Sinai in the second decade of his father's reign, and later in that decade was appointed as High Priest of Ra in Heliopolis, a position he held for the next twenty years. Two of his statues are now in Berlin and a stela belonging to him is in Hildesheim. An ostrakon mentions work on his tomb and that of Isetnofret; it implies he was buried in the area of the Valley of the Queens, though it is also possible he was buried in KV5, the tomb built for the sons of Ramesses, since a fragment of one of his canopic jars was found there.

It carries the Great Western Main Line from Paddington, London to Wales and the West across the River Thames. The bridge lies between the stations at Goring & Streatley and Cholsey, and crosses the Thames at an oblique angle on the reach between Cleeve Lock and Benson Lock. The original Moulsford Railway Bridge was built between 1838 and 1840, having been designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel for the main trunk route of the Great Western Railway. Built to carry a pair of broad gauge tracks across the Thames, it consists of four low semi-elliptical arches spanning the Thames at a considerably skewed angle of 60 degrees. During the 1890s, a second bridge was built immediately parallel to the original structure, enabling the railway to be expanded to a quadruple track configuration. The bridge was subsequently recognised as a Grade II* listed structure. During the 2010s, the lines across the structure were electrified Construction=First bridge The original Moulsford Railway Bridge was built to carry the main line of the Great Western Railway (GWR) over the River Thames. Construction of this truck line between London and Bristol had been authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1835, with construction commencing during the following year. The bridge, along with many of the railway's engineering features, was designed by the accomplished engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who was the leading figure in the GWR's engineering and management. The bridge, which was built to carry a pair of broad gauge tracks, was a relatively ambitious design, consisting of four elliptical skew arches of span and a headway height of . Consisting primarily of red brick with Bath stone quoins, it is skewed at an angle of 60 degrees to the river. The structure has often been regarded as being of an exceptional size for the era; to better accommodate such dimensions, Brunel incorporated a series of internal longitudinal walls and voids to lighten the superstructure, which also reduced the cost and time needed to construct it. It has been alleged that the GWR had promised the Bishop of Durham to aesthetically embellish the bridge to mollify his doubts of the scheme. Historic England has observed the bridge to be one of the most impressive structures along the whole length of the railway. Construction of the Moulsford Railway Bridge occurred between 1838 and 1840, having been built at the same time as several other railway bridges on the line, including those at Maidenhead and Gatehampton; furthermore, design features are shared between these three bridges. Relatively little alterations have been performed to the structure since its original opening to traffic, even the construction of a second bridge alongside did not result in significant changes to the original bridge, the two structures remaining distinct separate identities. Since the building of the second bridge, the first has been often referred to as the 'west' or 'fast' bridge. Second bridge Moulsford Railway Bridge from the upstream side, the newest is closest The bridges from underneath; the original is closest By the 1870s, capacity along the railway was becoming noticeably constrained by a lack of capacity, leading to pressure to widen the line wherever possible. During 1892, the section of the line around the bridge was expanded to a quadruple track arrangement; to accommodate this, the construction of a second bridge was necessary. It was built alongside the upstream side of the original, being connected to it by a series of girders and brick bridgelets. The two bridges are also joined together at the deck level by a series of vaulted brick footbridges. The design of the second bridge was, like many other structures built for the expansion, was intentionally designed to be sympathetic to Brunel's original bridge; thus, it shares many similarities, such as identical profile and dimensions, to the first bridge. It also has several differences, such as the lack of stone quoins, while the plain uncut bricks form a jagged pattern where they meet the faces of the bridge. The second bridge is also somewhat narrower than the first, having been built to carry a pair of standard gauge tracks. In relation to the original bridge, it is often referred to as the 'east' or 'relief' bridge. The second bridge has typically been regarded as possessing less intrinsic merit than the first one. Alterations During the 1970s, the Great Western Mail Line was subject to extensive reengineering work to enable 125 MPH running for the newly-introduced Intercity 125 services; accordingly, some changes were made to Moulsford Railway Bridge. Work on constructing safety refuges commenced, despite protection from preservation orders and objections filed by council authorities; British Rail's chief engineering at Reading was allegedly unhappy with the work, resulting in alternative plans being filed and subsequently enacted. Between March and July 2016, national rail infrastructure owner Network Rail commissioned contractors to perform repairs and cleaning activities to the two bridges; this involved the temporary staged closure of each arch to river traffic. During the 2010s, the railway lines crossing the bridge were electrified, requiring the installation of OHLE across the structure. Members of the public voiced concerns over the aesthetic impact of such modifications to the structure; for its part, Network Rail commissioned studies into minimising the visual impact of the electrification effort.

The effect is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum. It is strong enough to be observable in ferromagnetic materials. The experimental observation and accurate measurement of the effect demonstrated that the phenomenon of magnetization is caused by the alignment (polarization) of the angular momenta of the electrons in the material along the axis of magnetization. These measurements also allow the separation of the two contributions to the magnetization: that which is associated with the spin and with the orbital motion of the electrons. The effect also demonstrated the close relation between the notions of angular momentum in classical and in quantum physics. The effect was predicted by O. W. Richardson in 1908. It is named after Albert Einstein and Wander Johannes de Haas, who published two papers in 1915 claiming the first experimental observation of the effect.  Description  The orbital motion of an electron (or any charged particle) around a certain axis produces a magnetic dipole with the magnetic moment of \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu} = e/2m \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{j}, where e and m are the charge and the mass of the particle, while \\\\mathbf{j} is the angular momentum of the motion. In contrast, the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron is related to its intrinsic angular momentum (spin) as \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu} \\\\approx{} 2\\\\cdot{}e/2m \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{j} (see Land√© g-factor and anomalous magnetic dipole moment). If a number of electrons in a unit volume of the material have a total orbital angular momentum of \\\\mathbf{J_o} with respect to a certain axis, their magnetic moments would produce the magnetization of \\\\mathbf{M_o} = e/2m \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{J_o}. For the spin contribution the relation would be \\\\mathbf{M_s} \\\\approx e/m \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{J_s}. A change in magnetization, \\\\Delta\\\\mathbf{M}, implies a proportional change in the angular momentum, \\\\Delta\\\\mathbf{J}\\\\propto{}\\\\Delta\\\\mathbf{M}, of the electrons involved. Provided that there is no external torque along the magnetization axis applied to the body in the process, the rest of the body (practically all its mass) should acquire an angular momentum -\\\\Delta\\\\mathbf{J} due to the law of conservation of angular momentum. Experimental setup Experimental setup The experiments involve a cylinder of a ferromagnetic material suspended with the aid of a thin string inside a cylindrical coil which is used to provide an axial magnetic field that magnetizes the cylinder along its axis. A change in the electric current in the coil changes the magnetic field the coil produces, which changes the magnetization of the ferromagnetic cylinder and, due to the effect described, its angular momentum. A change in the angular momentum causes a change in the rotational speed of the cylinder, monitored using optical devices. The external field \\\\mathbf{B} interacting with a magnetic dipole \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu} can not produce any torque ( \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau} = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B} ) along the field direction. In these experiments the magnetization happens along the direction of the field produced by the magnetizing coil, therefore, in absence of other external fields, the angular momentum along this axis must be conserved. In spite of the simplicity of such a layout, the experiments are not easy. The magnetization can be measured accurately with the help of a pickup coil around the cylinder, but the associated change in the angular momentum is small. Furthermore, the ambient magnetic fields, such as the Earth field, can provide a 107  108 times larger mechanical impact on the magnetized cylinder. The later accurate experiments were done in a specially constructed demagnetized environment with active compensation of the ambient fields. The measurement methods typically use the properties of the torsion pendulum, providing periodic current to the magnetization coil at frequencies close to the pendulum's resonance. The experiments measure directly the ratio: \\\\lambda =\\\\Delta\\\\mathbf{J}/\\\\Delta\\\\mathbf{M} and derive the dimensionless gyromagnetic factor g' (see g-factor) of the material from the definition: g' \\\\equiv{} \\\\frac{2m}{e}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda}. The quantity \\\\gamma \\\\equiv \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{e}{2m}g' is called gyromagnetic ratio. History The expected effect and a possible experimental approach was first described by Owen Willans Richardson in a paper published in 1908. The electron spin was discovered in 1925, therefore only the orbital motion of electrons was considered before that. Richardson derived the expected relation of \\\\mathbf{M} = e/2m \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{J}. The paper mentioned the ongoing attempts to observe the effect at Princeton. In that historical context the idea of the orbital motion of electrons in atoms contradicted classical physics. This contradiction was addressed in the Bohr model in 1913, and later was removed with the development of quantum mechanics. S.J. Barnett, motivated by the Richardson's paper realized that the opposite effect should also happen - a change in rotation should cause a magnetization ( the Barnett effect). He published the idea in 1909, after which he pursued the experimental studies of the effect. Einstein and de Haas published two papers in April 1915 containing a description of the expected effect and the experimental results. In the paper \\"Experimental proof of the existence of Ampere's molecular currents\\" they described in details the experimental apparatus and the measurements performed. Their result for the ratio of the angular momentum of the sample to its magnetic moment (the authors called it \\\\lambda) was very close (within 3%) to the expected value of 2m/e. It was realized later that their result with the quoted uncertainty of 10% was not consistent with the correct value which is close to m/e. Apparently, the authors underestimated the experimental uncertainties. S.J. Barnett reported the results of his measurements at several scientific conferences in 1914. In October 1915 he published the first observation of the Barnett effect in a paper titled \\"Magnetization by Rotation\\". His result for \\\\lambda was close to the right value of m/e, which was unexpected at that time. In 1918 J.Q. Stewart published the results of his measurements confirming the Barnett's result. In his paper he was calling the phenomenon 'The Richardson effect'. The following experiments demonstrated that the gyromagnetic ratio for iron is indeed close to e/m rather than e/2m. This phenomenon, dubbed \\"gyromagnetic anomaly\\" was finally explained after the discovery of the spin and introduction of the Dirac equation in 1928.  Literature about the effect and its discovery  Detailed accounts of the historical context and the explanations of the effect can be found in literature, see for example ,.

According to Frenkel Einstein wrote in a report to the German Physical Society: \\"In the past three months I have performed experiments jointly with de Haas-Lorentz in the Imperial Physicotechnical Institute that have firmly established the existence of Amp√®re molecular currents.\\" Probably, he attributed the hyphenated name to Wander Johannes de Haas, not meaning both de Haas and H. A. Lorentz. Later measurements and applications The effect was used to measure the properties of various ferromagnetic elements and alloys. The key to more accurate measurements was better magnetic shielding, while the methods were essentially similar to those of the first experiments. The experiments measure the value of the g-factor g' =\\\\frac{2m}{e}\\\\frac{M}{J} (here we use the projections of the pseudovectors \\\\mathbf{M} and \\\\mathbf{J} onto the magnetization axis and omit the \\\\Delta sign). The magnetization and the angular momentum consist of the contributions from the spin and the orbital angular momentum: M=M_s+M_o, J=J_s+J_o. Using the known relations M_o=\\\\frac{e}{2m}J_o, and M_s=g\\\\cdot{}\\\\frac{e}{2m}J_s, where g\\\\approx{}2.002 is the g-factor for the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, one can derive the relative spin contribution to magnetization as: \\\\frac{M_s}{M}=\\\\frac{(g'-1)g}{(g-1)g'}. For pure iron the measured value is g'=1.919\\\\pm{}0.002, and \\\\frac{M_s}{M}\\\\approx{}0.96. Therefore, in pure iron 96% of the magnetization is provided by the polarization of the electrons' spins, while the remaining 4% is provided by the polarization of their orbital angular momenta.

Orchomenos was a prehistoric settlement and became one of the powerful cities in West Arcadia along with Tegea and Mantineia. The heyday of the city was between 7th‚Äì6th century BC and it became a rich city which minted its own currency. Its ruins are near the modern village of Orchomenos (before 1963: ŒöŒ±ŒªœÄŒ¨Œ∫Œπ, KalpakiName changes of settlements in Greece). Situation Orchomenos was initially established at the foot of the acropolis on a plain surrounded on every side by mountains. Later the settlement was built on the mountain where the most important monuments of the city have been found. The modern village of Orchomenos stands on the site of lower Orchomenus. This plain was bounded on the south by a low range of hills, called Anchisia, which separated it from the territory of Mantineia: on the north by a lofty chain, called Oligyrtus, through which lie the passes into the territories of Pheneus and Stymphalus, and on the east and west by two parallel chains running from north to south. Orchomenos theatre and Karst depression, 2006 The plain is divided into two by hills projecting from the eastern and western ranges, and which approach so close as to allow space for only a narrow ravine between them. Upon the summit of the western hill stood the acropolis of Orchomenus, nearly high, resembling the strong fortress of Messenian Ithome and, like the latter, commanding two plains. The waters of the southern part of the plain run through the ravine into the northern plain where, as there is no outlet for the waters, they formed a large lake. This description is that of Pausanias‚Äô time, AD 110 ‚Äì ca. 180). Today the lake is gone. The two plains are characterized as closed geological basins (Karst depressions), where, even today, precipitation has a seasonally inadequate subsurface drainage by ditches, Katavothres (Greek term for ponors) and a man made tunnel.Pausanias, Description of Greece, viii. 13. ¬ß 4 History Orchomenus is mentioned by Homer, who gives it the epithet of () which meant \\"abundant in sheep,\\"Homer. The Iliad, ii. 605. and it is also called ferax by Ovid,Ovid. Metamorphoses, vi. 416. and by Apollonius RhodiusApollonius Rhodius, iii. 512. Pausanias relates that Orchomenus was founded by an eponymous hero, the son of Lycaon;Pausanias. Description of Greece, viii. 3. ¬ß 3. but there was a tradition that, on the death of Arcas, his dominions were divided among his three sons, of whom Elatus obtained Orchomenus as his portion.Schol. ad. Dionys. Per. 415. The kings of Orchomenus are said to have ruled over nearly all Arcadia.Heraclid. Pont. ap. Diog. Laert. i. 94. Pausanias also gives a list of the kings of Orchomenus, whom he represents at the same time as kings of Arcadia. One of these kings, Aristocrates, the son of Aechmis, was stoned to death by his people for violating the virgin priestess of Artemis Hymnia. Aristocrates was succeeded by his son Hicetas, and Hicetas by his son Aristocrates II who, having abandoned the Messenians in the second war against Sparta, experienced the fate of his grandfather being stoned to death by the Arcadians. He appears to have been the last king of Orchomenus, who reigned over Arcadia, but his family was not deprived of the kingdom of Orchomenus as is stated in some authorities since we find his son Aristodemus represented as king of the city.Pausanias. Description of Greece, viii. 5; Polybius, iv. 3; Heracl. Pont. l. c. It would appear, indeed, that royalty continued to exist at Orchomenus long after its abolition in most other Greek cities, since Theophilus related that Peisistratus, king of Orchomenus, was put to death by the aristocracy in the Peloponnesian War.Plutarch Parallel Lives, 32. In the Persian Wars, Orchomenus sent 120 men to Thermopylae,Herodotus. Histories, viii. 102. and 600 to Plataea.Herodotus. Histories, ix. 28. In the Peloponnesian War, the Lacedaemonians deposited in Orchomenus the hostages they had taken from the Arcadians; but the walls of the city were then in a dilapidated state; and accordingly, when the Athenians and their Peloponnesian allies advanced against the city in 418 BC, the Orchomenians dared not offer resistance, and surrendered the hostages.Thucydides. History of the Peloponnesian War, v. 61. At the time of the foundation of Megalopolis, we find the Orchomenians exercising supremacy over Theisoa, Methydrium, and Teuthis; but the inhabitants of these cities were then transferred to Megalopolis, and their territories assigned to the latter.Pausanias. Description of Greece, viii.27. ¬ß4. The Orchomenians, through their enmity to the Mantineians, refused to join the Arcadian confederacy, and made war upon the Mantineians.Xen. Hell. vi. 5. 11, seq.; Diod. xv. 62. Henceforth, Orchomenus lost its political importance; but, from its commanding situation, its possession was frequently an object of the belligerent powers in later times. In the war between Cassander and Polyperchon, it fell into the power of the former, 313 BC.Diod. xix. 63. It subsequently espoused the side of the Aetolians, made an agreement with the Achaean League under a ruler named Nearchus around 234 BC,Michel Austin, The Hellenistic World from Alexander to the Roman Conquest, 2nd edition, p.145f. was taken by Cleomenes III in 229 BC with the acquiescence of the Aetolians,Polybius, ii. 46. and was in 223 BC retaken by Antigonus Doson, who placed there a Macedonian garrison.Polybius, ii. 54, iv. 6; Plut. Arat. 5. Later, under Roman pressure, it was given back by Philip V to the Achaeans.Liv. xxxii. 5. Strabo mentions it among the Arcadian cities, which had either disappeared, or of which there were scarcely any traces left;Strabo. Geographica, viii. p. 338. but this appears from Pausanias to have been an exaggeration. Pausanias (writing in the 2nd c. AD) mentions, amongst other monuments, that close to the city was a wooden statue of Artemis, enclosed in a great cedar tree, and hence called Cedreatis.Pausanias. Description of Greece, viii. 13. When the 19th century classicist William Smith visited the place the old city on the acropolis was in ruins and there were only some vestiges of the agora and the town walls. Ruins Many monuments were revealed during the excavations and can be admired today including the theatre, the remains of the ancient agora, the city walls and the temple of Artemis Mesopolitis. Other monuments identified during the excavations are a Bouleuterion, a prehistoric tomb and a bridge of the Archaic Period. The most important monument is the theatre (4th‚Äì3rd BC) with a capacity of 4,000. At an altitude of 800 metres it offered a spectacular view during cultural events. Pausanias described the temples of Artemis and Poseidon as among the most remarkable monuments. Approaching the town from the south one can see tumuli on the left, chiefly composed of collections of stones as described by Pausanias. Below the acropolis is the tomb of Aristocrates and beyond are the fountains called Teneiae () which Pausanias mentions (writing in the 2nd c. AD) as one of the most remarkable objects in the place. A little further are the Hellenistic ruins of Amilus.Edward Dodwell, Classical Tour, vol. ii. p. 425, seq.; Leake, Morea, vol. iii. p. 99, seq.; Boblaye, R√©cherches, p. 149; Curtius, Peloponnesos, vol. i. p. 219, seq.

According to Frontline (PBS) Although many believe that tests are the best or only indicator of student performance, it is important to remember that there are other indicators of a child's knowledge and skill levels. Moreover, achievement tests are sometimes used to measure or evaluate aspects of education for which they are not designed, including how well a school is educating its students. Despite what some see as problems and controversies, tests are very successful in measuring the things they are designed to measure. There are, however, many skills and attributes tests do not measure. For example, standardized tests do not measure a child's motivation to understand new material and perform well in school. They also will not measure a child's creativity or curiosity, nor the ability to cooperate in a group, challenge assumptions, or complete in-depth projects. None of these characteristics is tested, yet they are all essential skills for further education, workplace preparation, and life in general. It is important to remember that performance on standardized tests is not a complete indication of the full range of a child's academic abilities.

He spent several years in Rome, where he arrived still child, to succeed his uncle Stephan, ambassador to Pope Sixtus IV. Here, in the circle of Pomponio Leto, his poetic talent awoke. He studied ancient drama and made a study of the comedies of Plautus. It was in this period that he produced Lexicon (1480), an encyclopedic dictionary in Latin, 429 pages long and in quarto format (33 x 23 cm).

His main work, De Epidauro, was a draft of an epic poem, about the Ottoman invasions of Ragusan territory. A staunch supporter of Latin, he disliked Slavic, which was spoken in the Republic in great numbers. He declared his nostalgia for the times when no language other than Latin had been officially used in Ragusa, and wished not to hear the \\"infecting Slavic language\\".Documentation Centre of Dalmatian Culture , Uomini Illustri, Elio Lampridio Cerva, poeta incoronato He knew and wrote solely in Latin, as mentioned by him in one of his works: See also * List of Ragusans  References  People from the Republic of Ragusa 1463 births 1520 deaths Latin-language writers People from Dubrovnik Ragusan poets 15th-century Croatian poets ","title":"Elio Lampridio Cerva"},{"id":"9632204","text":"de Vaucouleurs's law, also known as the de Vaucouleurs profile or de Vaucouleurs model, describes how the surface brightness I of an elliptical galaxy varies as a function of apparent distance R from the center of the galaxy: Recherches sur les Nebuleuses Extragalactiques : \\\\ln I(R) = \\\\ln I_{0} - k R^{1/4}.

It runs from U.S. Highway 69 in Kiowa to the Arkansas state line. SH-1 forms a concurrency with SH-63 for , nearly forty percent of the highway's length. SH-63 has one spur route, designated as SH-63A. SH-63 was added to the state highway system on November 6, 1935 as a short link highway between Talihina and SH-2. The highway was gradually extended to its present length between then and 1960. When the current incarnation of SH-1 was established, the middle of SH-63 was turned over to the new highway, leaving SH-63 in two separate parts. The two sections were connected via a concurrency in the early 1980s. Route description SH-63 heads northeast from Kiowa, passing through Pittsburg and crossing under the Indian Nation Turnpike near Blanco. In Haileyville, it meets US-270/SH-1 and begins a concurrency with them. After passing through Hartshorne, US-270 splits off. Seven miles (11 km) later, the highways pass through unincorporated Higgins, then continues east for , where they meets State Highway 2 and the two highways concur with it. The SH-1/2/63 concurrency heads south for six miles (10 km). West of Buffalo Valley, SH-2 splits off to the south as SH-1/63 head east. In Talihina, the highways meet US-271, which SH-1 joins. SH-63 heads east alone, passing through Whitesboro and Muse. In Big Cedar, it crosses U.S. Highway 259. It then enters Ouachita National Forest and ends at the state line. Arkansas Highway 8 continues on to Mena. History State Highway 63 was first established on November 6, 1935 as a connection between SH-2 and US-271 in Talihina. On April 1, 1936, the highway was extended east to end at the Arkansas state line. This remained the highway's extent for the remainder of the 1930s and the 1940s. The highway was extended west for the first time on August 4, 1952, when SH-63's western terminus was set at US-270 near Hartshorne. The highway was extended further west on January 29, 1960, bringing it to US-69 in Kiowa. The SH-63 of 1960 had the same basic route as that of the present day. Minor realignments to the highway occurred on September 6, 1962 northwest of the northern SH-2 junction, and through Haileyville and Hartshorne on August 3, 1964. The current State Highway 1 was designated on February 5, 1968. The portion of highway between Haileyville and Talihina was made solely part of SH-1. This left SH-63 in two discontinuous sections, one between Kiowa and Haileyville and one from Talihina to the Arkansas line. This situation would persist for fifteen years. On July 7, 1983, SH-63 was restored between the two segments, forming the SH-1/63 concurrency. No further changes have occurred to the highway since.

They were invited to share the stage with the death metal band Krisiun, local the band Criminal and other Chilean bands. A growing reputation and praise from bands like Atheist, Darkane and Watchtower members led to a deal with the French record label Sekhmet, which released the Genesis album in Europe. A few weeks before the European release, Ruiz and subsequently Solari moved to Sweden, which gave the band to a period of inactivity until mid-2003, when they started to write the music for their following album, Unorthodox Creative Criteria, released in July 2005.

Tom Mix was still an A-list star in 1935, alongside Charles Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and Mary Pickford. He was paid $40,000 for four weeks work on The Miracle Rider, which he used as urgent funding to support his circus. The serial combined the large cast and interlocking plots of a silent serial with the science fiction and cliffhangers of the sound era. Filming of the outdoor action sequences took place primarily at the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, Calif., on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The movie ranch, which had been in use as a filming location since the early silent movie era, was known for its rugged landscape and giant sandstone boulders. One of those boulders became known as Tom Mix Rock in later years, after it was discovered that bootholes had been carved in the rock to help the actor shoot a scene atop the rock for The Miracle Rider. Stunts Tom Mix, whose voice was strained and nasal due to a repeatedly broken nose and a bullet through his throat, did a lot of his own stunts, although some were doubled by Cliff Lyons.

It was, by most accounts, one of the original Cuban tobaccos that emerged around the time of Columbus. The term means native seed, and thus a tobacco variety using the term, such as Dominican Criollo, may or may not have anything to do with the original Cuban seed nor the recent hybrid, Criollo '98. Uses Originally, Criollo had multiple uses in the construction of the Cuban cigar. After the development of Corojo, Criollo was increasingly relegated to use as filler, and the Corojo, which was better suited for use as a wrapper, replaced it. It was then discovered that when Criollo is grown under cover, as opposed to growing it in the sun as was traditionally done, it can make a very suitable wrapper leaf, given the proper care and conditions. Some of the first Criollo seed grown for wrapper was grown in the Jalapa Valley of Nicaragua, and was introduced to the non-Cuban market in 2001 as the wrapper for the Cupido Criollo brand. The hybrid variety, Criollo 98, is Blue Mold resistant, and was developed in Cuba to replace the earlier Corojo hybrid, Habana 2000, which was losing favor due to its increasingly apparent short-comings.

His studies were interrupted after his first semester when he was drafted into the navy. He served for two years, and then followed Robert Oppenheimer, who had served as a mentor at Berkeley, to Princeton University in 1947. He earned his Ph.D. at Princeton under David Bohm in 1950. Research interests His last research concerned the search for the organizing principles responsible for emergent behavior in materials where unexpectedly new classes of behavior emerge in response to the strong and competing interactions among their elementary constituents. Some recent research results on correlated electron materials are the development of a consistent phenomenological description of protected magnetic behavior in the pseudogap state of underdoped cuprate superconductors and the discovery of the protected emergence of itinerancy in the Kondo lattice in heavy electron materials and its description using a two-fluid model. He remained interested in the superfluidity of neutron stars revealed by pulsar glitches and in elementary excitations in the helium liquids.

The Tavoliere delle Puglie (; ) is a plain in northern Apulia, southern Italy, occupying nearly a half of the Capitanata traditional region. It covers a surface of c. 3,000 km¬≤, once constituting a sea bottom: it is bounded by the Daunian Pre-Apennines on the West, the Gargano Promontory and the Adriatic Sea on the East, by the Fortore river on the north, and the Ofanto river on the south. It is the largest Italian plain after the Pianura Padana. The name Tavoliere derives from the Medieval Latin term , a table on which Transumanza officials classified the areas devoted to sheep farming. In winter the plain is sometimes subject to floods by the Ofanto and the Fortore, while in summer drought is frequent. The main centres, from north to south, are San Severo, Lucera, Foggia and Cerignola. History Neolithic farmers living in Tavoliere over 7000 years ago practiced ritual defleshing of the dead. Light cut marks on the bones suggest the bones were defleshed up to a year after death. They deposited the bones in Scaloria Cave. The human bones were mixed with animal bones, broken pottery and stone tools. During the Middle Ages the old practices of agriculture and fluvial regulation were lost, the plain being mostly devoted to sheep farming which, using apposite cattle-tracks, reached the Apennines' pasture lands through the Tavoliere. The lands was most marshy and unhealthy. After extensive works of drainage, the plain is now highly cultivated. Crops include wheat, beet, tomato, especially in the area of Foggia, while also spread are cultivations of olives and grapes, which produce quality oils and wines. Communes The comuni in the Tavoliere delle Puglie are: Alberona, Apricena, Ascoli Satriano, Biccari; Bovino, Candela, Carapelle, Casalvecchio di Puglia, Castelluccio dei Sauri, Castelnuovo della Daunia, Cerignola, Chieuti, Deliceto, Foggia, Lucera, Manfredonia, Margherita di Savoia, Ordona (Herdonia), Orta Nova, Poggio Imperiale, San Ferdinando di Puglia, San Paolo di Civitate, San Severo, Serracapriola, Stornara, Stornarella, Torremaggiore, Trinitapoli, Troia, Volturino, Zapponeta.

He was the fourth of seven children, all of whom were boys. He grew up working part-time in a vineyard to help pay for his brother's way through college. He did not attend school past grade 10 and planned to pick grapes for the rest of his life. However, when he started writing poetry at age thirteen, in 1961, published his first collection of poetry, titled An Ode to Railway Workers, at age eighteen. This publication sold only a few hundred copies; nonetheless, Joseph continued to write. He also started to draw, sometimes of the characters in his poems, and his artwork has come to supersede some of his early poetry. Joseph continued to write and draw, publishing Four Backwards Men in a Coffee Mug (1968), the epic two-part Anteater's Paradise (1976), and the critically acclaimed The Anatomy of a Wallflower (1979). However, after his father's death in 1982, Joseph went into seclusion and ceased from writing or drawing. Despair continued as he was soon diagnosed with Shruff's Disease at forty-two, an incurable nerve disorder that breaks down nerve tissue and sends its victim to an early grave. Shaken by this tragic turn of events, Joseph lived out his final years in a state of insomnia and paranoia, and doctors declared him mentally insane two years before he died. Upon his death, Joseph uttered his final remarks: \\"The world is a bastard.\\" The McCartney Association for Shruff's Disease Victims (MASDV) was established in 1997 to offer hope for those with the disorder. It is still in operation to this day and has raised $4.4 million for its cause.

It is located about 30 miles (50 kilometers) west of Phoenix and about 6 miles (10 kilometers) southeast of Buckeye. Liberty is located at the intersection of South Jackrabbit Trail and West Baseline Road. It is located entirely within Block 3017, Block Group 3, Census Tract 506.01, Maricopa County, Arizona, which had a population of 63 at the 2000 census. The original settlers named the location Altamount, the settlement soon became called Toothaker Place, after the first postmaster, Harriet Toothaker, who ran the post office out of her home. When the post office was relocated in 1901, it was renamed Liberty, and with it the community. Liberty is home to the Liberty Elementary School District headquarters, although the district itself has expanded out to include much of the surrounding areas of Buckeye and Goodyear. Liberty exists as a county island within the corporate boundaries of Buckeye. This precludes any possibility of incorporation for the community. Notable person *John C.

Prelude  With a population of six million, Shanghai was the largest city in China in 1949 and provided around a third of the total GDP of China by that time. Both the communists and the nationalists believed that World War III was a real possibility and this perception influenced the strategic decisions of both sides. The nationalists who defended the city had hoped that by using the resources of the wealthiest city of China, they would last until World War III when foreign intervention would occur. With foreign intervention, not only they would be able to defend the city, but they could counterattack and take China back from the enemy. If the city could not last until World War III, the nationalist would withdraw via sea and transfer the wealth with them, after destroying the city completely, just like the scorched-earth policy used against the Japanese invaders in many parts of China during World War II. Although the truthfulness of this perception of the nationalists remained in question, the enemy certainly believed that there was a possibility, as the nationalist propaganda had claimed, and thus was determined not to let it happen by taking the city as early as possible.  Defending force: the nationalist strategy  The nationalist commander divided the city into two sectors along the Huangpu River. The western half of the city and the surrounding regions including Taicang, Kunshan, Jiaxing, and Golden Mountain Jinshan, were defended by a total of 20 divisions (including all of the armored force) belonging to the 21st Army, the 51st Army, the 52nd Army, the 54th Army, the 75th Army and the 123rd Army. The 12th Army and the 35th Army totaled five divisions and the naval and air assets were tasked to defend Pudong, with emphasis on regions included Wusong, Yuepu (ÊúàÊµ¶), Yanghang (Êù®Ë°å), Liuhang (ÂàòË°å), Dachang (Â§ßÂú∫), Gaohang (È´òË°å), and Gaoqiao, in order to secure the escape route via sea. The nationalist force defending the city totaled more than 210,000. The buildings in the city were perfect defending positions which were further boosted by large amount of the concrete bunkers built.  Attacking force: the communist strategy  The PLA 3rd Field Army under the commander-in-chief Chen Yi and deputy commander-in-chief Su Yu was tasked to take the city. The communists massed more than 290,000 troops totaled 10 armies to attack the city, while the communist 2nd Field Army under the commander-in-chief Liu Bocheng and political commissar Deng Xiaoping massed at Jinhua and Dongxiang (‰∏ú‰π°) via Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway, in order to prevent any foreign intervention that never came. The primary goal of the communists was to take the city with minimal damage to the city and minimal civilian casualties, so that future reconstruction would be easy by utilizing the existing infrastructure and skilled labor force. To prevent the defenders from transferring large amount of wealth via sea, a pincer movement would be launched from both the east and west, targeting Wusong, so that the defenders' escape route via sea would be cut and the city would be attacked afterward and by isolating the defenders into separate pockets, and then the city would be taken by decimating the isolated defenders. One prong of the communist pincer movement included the 26th Army, the 28th Army, the 29th Army, the 33rd Army of the communist X Corps and a part of the communist Artillery Column attacking from Changshu and Suzhou toward Kunshan, Taicang, and Jiading, eventually reaching Wusong, thus blocking off the defenders' escape route via sea by cutting off the traffic of Huangpu River. Afterward, this prong of the pincer movement would attack the city from northwest. The other prong of the communist pincer movement included the 20th Army, the 27th Army, 30th Army, and the 31st Army of the communist IX Corps and a part of communist Artillery Column. Two armies would attack from Nanxun and Wujiang, toward Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha regions near/in Pudong, helping the communist X Corps to blockade the Wusong after approaching Gaoqiao. Another two armies would group at the regions south of Songjiang and east of Jiaxing, taking Qingpu when the situation permitted, and then attack the city from the east, south and west. In case of the defenders were successful in transferring materials away from the city, the attackers also prepared large amount of food and coal for the civilian population, and over 5,000 communist civilian cadres were also drafted to take over the administrative functions after the city was taken.  Order of battle  Defenders: Republic of China Armed Forces order of battle: * The 21st Army * The 51st Army * The 52nd Army * The 54th Army * The 75th Army * The 123rd Army * The 12th Army * The 35th Army * The 1st Naval District * Air Force units * 5 Traffic Police Divisions Attackers: People's Liberation Army order of battle: * The 20th Army of the IX Corps * The 23rd Army of the VII Corps * The 25th Army of the VIII Corps * The 26th Army of the X Corps * The 27th Army of the IX Corps * The 28th Army of the X Corps * The 29th Army of the X Corps * The 30th Army of the IX Corps * The 31st Army of the IX Corps * The 33rd Army of the X Corps * The Artillery Column  First stage  The campaign begun on May 12, 1949 when the planned assaults on the outer defense perimeters of the city had begun. Two days later, the communist IX Corps succeeded in taking regions included Pinghu, Jinshanwei (ÈáëÂ±±Âç´), Fengxian, Nanhui, Qingpu, Songjiang, threatened the flank of the defenders at Chuansha. The nationalist 51st Army was forced to be redeployed from the city to strengthen the defense of Bailonggang (ÁôΩÈæôÊ∏Ø), Lin's Family's Pier (Linjia Matou, ÊûóÂÆ∂Á†ÅÂ§¥) and other positions at outer defensive zones. Meanwhile, the communist X Corps succeeded in taking Taicang, Kunshan, Jiading, and Liuhe, and continued their attack on Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang. However, from their concrete bunkers and with the help of naval and air support, the defenders held on and when the nationalist 99th Division of the 21st Army was redeployed from the city to Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang for reinforcement, the defenders was able to beat back the attacking enemy. After the setback, the enemy adjusted their tactic by adopting small formations to take one bunker at a time, and with the rapid utilization of the experienced gained in fighting against the fortified positions consisted of concrete bunkers, the speed of attack was greatly accelerated. By May 19, 1949, the communist X Corps had managed to take Yuepu and the International Broadcasting Station, and annihilated the defenders stationed at Liuhang. Meanwhile, the communist IX Corps had managed to take Zhoupu (Âë®Êµ¶) and Chuansha, and completely annihilated the nationalist 51st Army defending Bailonggang, and isolated the nationalist 12th Army at Gaoqiao, while cutting off the links between the nationalist 37 Army at Pudong with other nationalist units via land.  Second stage  To secure the escape route via sea, the nationalist 75th Army was redeployed from the city to reinforce Gaoqiao, but after two armies and a division were withdrawn from the city to reinforce the positions of outer defensive perimeters, there was not enough force within the city to suppress the civilians who vehemently opposed the destruction of the city and organized themselves to protect infrastructure facilities within the city. As a result, the nationalist plan of destroying the city and transferring the wealth was not carried out fully as it had planned. The defenders' naval assets also faced great difficulties in that it was forced to fight at the enemy's turf: the inland riverine navigational channels were simply too narrow for the naval vessels to maneuver and they become sitting ducks for the enemy's long range shore batteries. After many extraordinarily brave but completely futile engagements by the outgunned nationalist naval assets which resulted in seven nationalist naval vessels damaged, it was painfully obvious that the naval asset must withdraw in the hopeless fights. When the nationalist naval fleet was forced to withdraw on May 23, 1949, the enemy's attempt to cut off the defenders' maritime escape route succeeded, and the sea to the east of Gaoqiao was blockaded by the enemy. After ten days of fierce fighting, the defenders suffered more than 20,000 casualties and lost all of the positions in the outer defensive perimeters. However, this might not be a bad thing because the defenders were able to concentrate their force in the city. The attacking enemy was well aware of this situation and adjusted their tactic once again: the 23rd Army of the communist VII Corps and the 25th Army of the communist VIII Corps were assigned to help the communist IX Corps and X Corps to take the city.  Third stage  The assault on the city begun at the night of May 23, 1949 when the communist 29th Army took the high ground in the southern suburb under the cover of darkness, while the communist 28th Army penetrated to Wusong and shelled the pier. On May 24, 1949, the communist 20th Army took Pudong and the communist 27th Army took the train station at Xujiahui and Hongqiao. The nationalist commander-in-chief, Tang Enbo already boarded naval ships on May 18, 1949, realized the inevitable and in order to strengthen the defense around the pier at Wusong, ordered the surviving 6th Division of the nationalist 75th Army at Gaoqiao to withdraw to Yuepu, and the nationalist units north of Suzhou Creek to withdraw to Wusong, for the preparation to withdraw via sea. Under the cover of darkness, the communist 23rd Army and the 27th Army penetrated the city from Xujiahui and Longhua respectively while the communist 20th Army crossed the Huangpu River at Gaochangmiao (È´òÊòåÂ∫ô) and by the dawn of May 25, 1949, everything south of the Suzhou Creek was firmly under the communist control. The enemy's offensive continued during the day with the communist 26th Army took Dachang and Jiangwan, and the communist 25th Army and the 29th Army took Wusong and Baoshan, while the communist 28th Army and the 33rd Army took Yanghang. At night, the communist 27th Army, 23rd Army and a portion of the 20th Army crossed the Suzhou Creek under the cover of darkness, and regions north of the creek fell into the attackers' hands. The deputy commander of the Shanghai defense, the commander of the Shanghai garrison, General Liu Changyi (ÂàòÊòå‰πâ) was forced to surrender. At the night of May 25, 1949, the communist 31st Army took Gaoqiao with the help of the communist 30th Army after fierce battle, and by the noon of May 26, 1949, the last defense in Pudong was wiped out. By May 27, 1949, the city had fallen to the enemy hands. Soon afterward, the communist 25th Army launched its assault on Chongming Island and badly mauled the defending force, and by June 2, 1949, the campaign had ended with the communist victory completed.  Outcome  The campaign had cost defenders heavily, with the exception of 50,000 defenders included the nationalist commander-in-chief Tang Enbo who managed to escape via sea, the entire 37th Army, the 51st Army and the 5 Traffic Police Divisions were totally annihilated, while the nationalist 12th Army, 21st Army, 52nd Army, 75th Army, and the 123rd Army were badly mauled, and the total nationalist casualties numbered more than 153,000. In addition to the city, more than 1,370 artillery pieces of various caliber, 1,161 automobiles, 11 naval vessels and 119 tanks and armored vehicles were captured by the enemy intact. Although the nationalists attempted to completely destroy the city, the enemy nonetheless managed to take the city relatively intact due to the local populace's strong opposition which had prevented the nationalists to carry out the scorch-earth policy as planned. The nationalists had committed a serious blunder before the campaign had even begun in that due to the political and psychological propaganda reasons, they had refused to evacuate the city, partially to avoid panic. The local populace was not allowed by the defenders to leave the city to surrender to the attacking enemy either and thus when the battle had begun, there were simply not enough transportation assets to evacuate everyone so the stranded populace felt helpless and abandoned. As the nationalists attempted to leave nothing behind for the attacking enemy by trying to transfer the wealth from the city and to destroy the city, such actions enraged the local populace because the very necessities which were essential to the survival of the local populace threatened and had the nationalists plan succeeded as it intended to, the stranded local populace that was already ravaged by the fierce battle would be further left in much greater destitution after the campaign. Like the general populace elsewhere in China, the stranded local populace in Shanghai was already alienated by the mistakes nationalists made earlier, such as corruption, but at least they were not unanimously against the nationalists regime, at least not yet. However, when the nationalists defenders of the city adopted these militarily correct strategies that would cause great harm to the local populace and threaten their very survival, the popular alienation toward the nationalists regime inevitably turned to resentment and the popular support was driven to the enemy side. Although enemy agents certainly played a part in organizing the local populace to protect factories, banks, shops and other infrastructure facilities, which had prevented the nationalists from carrying out the scorch- earth policy as they had planned, these actions were mostly voluntary at the local people's own wills and it had much more to do with the local populace's own concern of their survival after the campaign which would depend on these infrastructure, than helping out the attacking communists. The other nationalists blunder made was more in the military aspect: spending too much resource defending a political symbol instead of utilizing the resources to evacuate the city and transferring the wealth. Much of the nationalists force was spent at Shanghai, leaving other regions vulnerable, and the bulk of the communist VII Corps was able to take the advantage by taking Ningbo and Wenzhou during the campaign. As a result, not only the city was lost to the enemy relatively intact, along with a great portion of its wealth, many other surrounding regions also fell into the enemy hands, many with their wealth and resources.

Prior to his solo career, Dubfire made up half of the four times nominated and Grammy Award-winning duo, Deep Dish. Dubfire's style is noticeably different from that of Deep Dish, consisting of techno rather than progressive house. Biography Dubfire was born in Iran and moved to the United States at the age of 7 with his father, mother and brother for his father to attend an American university. Growing up in the Washington, DC area, Dubfire spent much of his youth playing the guitar in school bands and listening to heavy doses of classic hip hop, jazz/rare groove, dub, new wave and industrial and was also influenced by the local punk scene and the music of Washington DC-based bands including Fugazi and Minor Threat. He frequented a local record store called Yesterday And Today Records, where he became acquainted with the sounds of artists like Kraftwerk, Ministry, Jesus & Mary Chain, Depeche Mode, Nitzer Ebb, Adrian Sherwood of On-U Sound and Einst√ºrzende Neubauten. In 1991, Shirazinia and fellow DC resident Sharam Tayebi formed Deep Dish, a DJ and production duo that became notable for their productions and DJ sets. Deep Dish released acclaimed dance classics beginning with the 1995 remix of De'Lacy's \\"Hideaway\\", and went on to work with an eclectic array of names in pop, rock and electronica. Sharam and Dubfire established Deep Dish Records, and they went on to win a Grammy in 2002 for their remix of Dido's \\"Thank You\\" along with many other high-profile awards. Following their successes as Deep Dish, both Sharam and Dubfire began to produce and DJ individually claiming \\"[they] got bored doing the same thing. [They've] always been separate producers and separate DJs who have just collaborated together for all these years.\\" Shirazinia used his long-time stage name \\"Dubfire\\" for his solo productions. His solo sound differs noticeably from that of Deep Dish, consisting of minimal, techno, and house rather than the predominantly progressive house sound of Deep Dish. His production I Feel Speed, which is a cover of an obscure Love & Rockets song, features his own vocals. Dubfire also sings in In Love With a Friend on Deep Dish's debut album. I Feel Speed has appeared in the advertisement of the Volkswagen Eos. In 2007, Dubfire announced the launch of his new record label, Science + Technology Digital Audio, also known simply as SCI + TEC. He set the label up as an outlet to release his new music and began quietly unleashing a string of remarkable tracks. In 2007, he released electro-tech track \\"Roadkill,\\" while the stripped-back 'RibCage' became the first ever release on Loco Dice's Desolat label. Dubfire followed up with an onslaught of dancefloor-igniting releases, landing on some of electronic music's leading labels. Richie Hawtin, who signed Dubfire's \\"Emissions\\" to his highly respected Minus label, also released Dubfire's rework of 'Spastik' (the classic track that Hawtin produced in 1993 under his Plastikman alias) as an official re-work. Soon thereafter, Sven Vath's Cocoon Records took notice and released some of Dubfire's music as well. He continued to release more productions. He had two top 10 tracks in Resident Advisor's 100 Most Charted Records of 2007, International DJ Magazine's Player of the Year in 2008, nominations for Beatport's \\"Best Minimal Artist\\" and \\"Best Techno Artist\\" in 2008 and 2009, covers on countless music magazines, mixes for Mixmag, BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix and DJ Magazine. In 2008, Dubfire produced a remix of Radio Slave's \\"Grindhouse\\" featuring Danton Eeprom. It crossed nearly every genre and was the apex of a unique sound that DJ Magazine called \\"jet-black, polished chrome techno\\". Dubfire at the 2017 Miami International Film Festival Dubfire's recent work has seen him co-produce tracks with celebrated British electronic music act Underworld, release a two-disc compilation with Loco Dice for Cocoon, additional remixes of Plastikman material, and a collaborative project with respected producer Oliver Huntemann.

The student population has continued a steady trend of growth of 100 students per school year since the early 2000s. The ratio of males to females is 1:1, and the teacher to student ratio is 1:20.Springboro High School - Springboro, Ohio/OH - Public School Profile The Springboro Community City School District serves the city of Springboro and parts of Franklin, Clearcreek, Wayne, and Turtlecreek townships. Springboro High School is the only public high school in the suburb of Springboro and the only high school in the Springboro Community City School District. The school has been ranked academically \\"excellent\\" on a consistent basis, the highest possible rating by the state of Ohio Department of Education. SHS was established in 1893. In the 2011-12 school year SHS was honored as the top public high school in the Great Lakes region and was recognized as part of the United States Department of Education's National Blue Ribbon Schools Program.https://www2.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/2011/applications/oh7-springboro- high-school.pdf The current home of SHS has been open since August 1998 with two new academic wings added on and opened in August 2006. It is Springboro's third building used as the high school within the past forty years. The addition was $12 million, while the school was originally built for about $30 million. Athletics Springboro High School athletic teams are known as the Panthers, while the school colors are white and royal blue. The athletic program was a charter member of the Fort Ancient Valley Conference from 1964, when it joined as Clearcreek High School, until 1998. After many years of winning the All-Sports Trophy in the former Mid-Miami League, Springboro left for the Greater Western Ohio Conference, keeping heated rivalries with Lebanon High School and Miamisburg High School Springboro Community Schools completed a multimillion-dollar partnership with Miami Valley Hospital, giving them naming rights to the stadium CareFlight Field, named for the hospital's \\"CareFlight\\" helicopter. This deal also provides CareFlight Field with turf surfacing, a new track, and a three-story building which will house doctors' offices and athletic facilities, along with an adjoining press box. It was completed in 2009. Along with the football facilities, SHS basketball coach Troy Holtrey raised over $23,000 during the summer of 2006 to build a state of the art locker room. It comes complete with custom built lockers, automatic- retracting projector screen with high quality sound, and custom Springboro Panthers carpeting.

Construction started in 1804 to build the tidal New Cut and divert the River Avon along the Feeder Canal to the harbour; a system designed and built by William Jessop and later improved by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. A weir carries the river into the New Cut and boats use the adjacent lock. High tides often pass over the weir, and the river is effectively tidal to the next lock upstream at Hanham. Some spring tides can also pass over the weir at Hanham, making the river tidal as far as Keynsham Lock.

The Altopiano delle Murge (Italian for \\"Murge plateau\\") is a karst topographic plateau of rectangular shape in southern Italy. Most of it lies within Apulia and corresponds with the sub-region known as Murgia or Le Murge. The plateau lies mainly in the Metropolitan City of Bari and the province of Barletta-Andria-Trani, but extends into the provinces of Brindisi and Taranto to the south; and into Matera in Basilicata to the west. The name is believed to originate from the Latin murex, meaning \\"sharp stone\\". Geography and geology The Murge plateau covers a surface of some 4,000 km¬≤, bordered by the Ofanto river and the Tavoliere delle Puglie to the north, the Adriatic Sea to the northeast, and by the Messapic depression, which separates it from the Salento peninsula, to the south. It is usually divided into Alta Murgia (High Murgia), the highest area, with poorer vegetation, and Bassa Murgia (Lower Murgia), with more fertile land, extensively planted with olive-trees for the production of olives. The plateau is geologically homogeneous to a great extent, and lies mostly on the limestone formations of Calcare di Ban and Calcare di Altamura, with terra rossa deposits present in the sequence.Marino Maggetti, Bruno Messiga, Geomaterials in Cultural Heritage (2006), p. 51 The rocks are mostly Cretacic limestone, so that karst landscapes prevail in the area, with doline fields, some large dolines, sinkholes, and caves. The largest dolines are near Altamura, Gravina, and Molfetta. The large karstic doline of Molfetta is known locally as the ‚ÄúPulo‚Äù) and lies south-west of the town, near the Adriatic coast, taking the form of an oval-shaped depression with a depth of some thirty metres.Dragos Gheorghiu, Early Farmers, Late Foragers, and Ceramic Traditions (2009), p. 97 Near Castellana Grotte are the Castellana Caves, the most important in the Apulia region. The highest point of the plateau is called Monte Caccia, at 679 m. The climate is cold in winter, with average temperatures in the 1-6 ¬∞C range. In summer, they rise up to 30 ¬∞C. Rain, unlike in the arid Salento nearby, has an annual average of ca. 950 mm. Economy Historically, the Murge have been the seat of transhumance practice in animal husbandry, since at least the first millennium BC,T. H. Carpenter, K. M. Lynch, E. G. D. Robinson, The Italic People of Ancient Apulia (2014), p. 16 with cattle being moved to Abruzzo in summer, and southwards during winter. Until the 19th century, agriculture was characterized by large latifundia, owned by a few landowners, and the relative lack of water, forming part of a region sometimes called \\"the feudal South\\".Dino Carpanetto, Giuseppe Ricuperati, Italy in the age of reason, 1685-1789, Volume 5 (1987), p. 25 Present-day economic activities include marble quarries, and the production of olives, wine, almonds, cherries, and mulberries. The animals grazed include sheep, goats, domestic pigs, and cattle. A local breed of horse, known as Murgese, has been bred here since the Middle Ages. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the breed was ridden by Italian knights. In later centuries, the Murgese almost died out, but was revived in the 1920s.Andrea Fitzpatrick, The Ultimate Guide to Horse Breeds (2016), p. 212 Tourism and small industries (such as construction materials and bottling) are also active.

Primary tumors are most usually squamous cell carcinomas. Primary tumors are rare, and more usually vaginal cancer occurs as a secondary tumor. Vaginal cancer occurs more often in women over age 50, but can occur at any age, even in infancy. It often can be cured if found and treated in early stages. Surgery alone or surgery combined with pelvic radiation is typically used to treat vaginal cancer. Children can be diagnosed with advanced vaginal cancer. They are treated by surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Vaginal cancer in children may recur. Gene therapy to treat vaginal cancer is currently in clinical trials.  Description  Carcinoma of the vagina occurs in less than 2% of women with pelvic malignant tumors. Squamous carcinoma is the most common type of vaginal cancer. The human papilloma virus (HPV) is strongly associated with vaginal cancer. Vaginal cancer occurs most often in the upper third of the vagina (51%), 30% are found in the lower third, and 19% in the middle third. Vaginal cancer can present as an elevated lesion growing out from the epithelial surface or an ulcer-like, shallow depression. Definitive diagnosis is determined by biopsy. Signs and symptoms Most vaginal cancers do not cause signs or symptoms early on. When vaginal cancer does cause symptoms, they may include: * Vaginal discharge or abnormal bleeding * Unusually heavy flow of blood * Bleeding after menopause * Bleeding between periods; or any other * Bleeding that is longer than normal * Blood in the stool or urine * Frequent or urgent need to urinate * Feeling constipated * pain during sexual intercourse * a lump or growth in the vagina that can be felt Enlarged pelvic lymph nodes can sometimes be palpated  Risk factors  * Prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol * Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 * Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 * Previous history of cervical cancer * Smoking * Chronic vulvar itching or burning Types There are two primary types of vaginal cancer: squamous-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. * Squamous-cell carcinoma of the vagina arises from the squamous cells (epithelium) that line the vagina. This is the most common type of vaginal cancer. It is found most often in women aged 60 or older. * Vaginal adenocarcinoma arises from the glandular (secretory) cells in the lining of the vagina. Adenocarcinoma is more likely to spread to the lungs and lymph nodes. * Clear cell adenocarcinoma occurs in a small percentage of women (termed \\"DES-Daughters\\") born between 1938 and 1973 (later outside the United States) that were exposed to the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero. DES was prescribed to 5 to 10 million mothers period to prevent possible miscarriages and premature births. Typically, women develop DES-related adenocarcinoma before age 30, but increasing evidence suggests possible effects or cancers (including other forms of vaginal glandular tumors) at a later age. DES-exposure in women is also linked to various infertility and pregnancy complications. Daughters exposed to DES in utero may also have an increased risk of moderate/severe cervical squamous cell dysplasia and an increased risk of breast cancer. Approximately one in 1,000 (0.1%) DES Daughters will be diagnosed with clear cell adenocarcinoma. The risk is virtually non-existent among premenopausal women not exposed to DES. * Vaginal germ cell tumors (primarily teratoma and endodermal sinus tumor) are rare. They are found most often in infants and children. * Sarcoma botryoides, a rhabdomyosarcoma also is found most often in infants and children. * Vaginal melanoma, a melanoma that appears in the vagina. File:Diagram showing stage 1 vaginal cancer CRUK 194.svgStage 1 vaginal cancer File:Diagram showing stage 2 vaginal cancer CRUK 210.svgStage 2 vaginal cancer File:Diagram showing stage 3 vaginal cancer CRUK 223.svgStage 3 vaginal cancer File:Diagram showing stage 4A vaginal cancer CRUK 237.svgStage 4A vaginal cancer File:Diagram showing stage 4B vaginal cancer CRUK 240.svgStage 4B vaginal cancer Diagnosis Several tests are used to diagnose vaginal cancer, including: * Physical exam and history * Pelvic exam * Pap smear * Biopsy * Colposcopy Recommendations for women with vaginal cancer is not to have routine surveillance imaging to monitor the cancer unless they have new symptoms or rising tumor markers. Imaging without these indications is discouraged because it is unlikely to detect a recurrence or improve survival, and because it has its own costs and side effects. MRI provides visualization of the extent of vaginal cancer. Management Historically, the combination of external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) has been the most common treatment for vaginal cancer. In early stages of vaginal cancer, surgery also has some benefit. This management and treatment is less effective for those with advanced stages of cancer but works well in early stages with high rates of cure. Advanced vaginal cancer only has a 5-year survival rates of 52.2%, 42.5% and 20.5% for patients with stage II, III and IVa disease. Newer treatments for advanced stages of ovarian have been developed. These utilize concurrent carboplatin plus paclitaxel, EBRT and high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (HDR-ISBT). When the chance of surgical removal of all cancerous tissue is very low or when the surgery has a chance of damaging the bladder, vagina or bowel, radiation therapy is used. When a tumor is less than 4 cm in diameter, radiation therapy provides excellent results. In these instances, the 5-year survival rate is greater than 80%. Treatments are individualized due to the rarity of vaginal cancer studies.

History George F. Straub founded the clinic in 1921. Dr. Straub was educated in Germany and came to practice in Hawaii in 1907. In 1910, he conceived the idea of forming a group of physicians to provide better, more specialized care for his patients. It, however, took over 10 years to bring this idea to fruition. The first step in 1912 was the construction of a wood frame building at 410 South Beretania Street. Straub established his office on the first floor and his home on the second. By 1916 his practice had grown to the point that he recruited an assistant, Guy C. Milnor. Straub envisioned a clinic providing specialized care in five major fields: Obstetrics and Gynecology, Surgery, Internal Medicine, ENT, and Clinical Pathology. To this end, he next enlisted Arthur Jackson, a specialist in internal medicine in 1920 and the group carried on for a short time as Straub, Milnor, and Jackson. In the latter part of 1920, Howard Clarke resigned his commission in the United States Army and joined as a specialist in Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat. Eric A Fennel also left the Army about this time and joined the group as pathologist. In January, 1921, the five founding partners formally organized themselves as a legal partnership. At Straub's insistence the group he founded did not bear his name, and it was to be known simply as \\"The Clinic\\". A specialist in internal medicine and radiology, joined the clinic in 1921, a general surgeon in 1922, and a pediatrician joined in 1924. In 1952 the clinic was renamed \\"Straub Clinic\\" in honor of Straub, who died in May, 1966. On December 21, 2001 it became part of the Hawaii Pacific Health network. Straub currently has a total of 10 locations on 3 Hawaiian Islands: Oahu, Lanai, and Hawaii Island. On April 24, 2020 it was revealed that the Straub clinic was undergoing sex abuse lawsuits from people who claimed that one of clinic's former pediatricians John Stephenson, who committed suicide in 1970, sexually abused them when they were children.

History On March 28, 2017, Knox Trail Council and Old Colony Council voted to merge and create a new, combined council. The merger was executed on May 10, 2017, using the name \\"Council 251\\" to represent the new council until August 30, 2017, when the name \\"Mayflower Council\\" was selected. The council is headquartered at the former Knox Trail Council headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts, and the former Old Colony Council headquarters in Canton, Massachusetts is used as a satellite location. Districts Mayflower Council is separated into 5 districts. They are: *Cranberry Harbors District *Headwaters District *Metacomet District *Post Road District *Sachem District Camps Mayflower Council owns and operates 3 camps. They are Camp Squanto in Plymouth, Massachusetts, Camp Resolute in Bolton, Massachusetts, and Nobscot Scout Reservation in Sudbury, Massachusetts. Camp Squanto Camp Squanto is a camping facility located in Plymouth, Massachusetts, deep in the woods of Myles Standish State Forest. For seven weeks in the summer trained staff run a long-term camping experience for troops and individuals totalling nearly 2,000. During other weekends throughout the year Camp Squanto is available to various groups and activities, such as Troop or Webelos camping, band camps, retreats, Order of the Arrow events, Klondike Derbies, Parent-Son Weekends, among others. The camp attracts 20,000 weekend visitors annually. =1925-1949: Bloody Pond= Although the Brockton Council of the Boy Scouts of America, the precursor of the Squanto Council, was formed in 1919, the first Camp Squanto was not opened until 1925. The new camp was located on an site on the west side of Bloody Pond in Plymouth, Massachusetts. In the Spring of 1925, after an old farmhouse on the property was taken down, a combined dining and recreation hall was built. This building had facilities for 125 campers and staff, including a stone fireplace, a kitchen, storerooms, and an office for the camp. A waterfront area with a U shaped swimming dock, a lookout tower, and a fleet of canoes and rowboats was set up on the shore of the pond. An old bog on the former farm was converted into a sports field, and a campfire ring was built on a knoll near the waterfront. Parking and service areas were laid out in the rear of the dining hall, and an old farm woodshed was repaired for use as a crafts center during the camping season as well as off-season storage. The first camping season started in the first week of July, 1925. It was decided to call the new facility Camp Squanto, in honor of the Patuxet Indian, Tisquantum, whose aid to the Pilgrims in Plymouth helped them survive the first few difficult years of their settlement. Although the first Scouts to camp at Camp Squanto lived in tents, these were gradually replaced with Adirondack shelters. The Scouts were divided into tribes, the Dakota, Comanche, Blackfoot, and Apache, thus establishing a tradition of naming campsites after various Indian tribes which continues today at Camp Squanto. In 1932, the Brockton Scout Council which had previously included only the city of Brockton was expanded to take in the surrounding communities of Abington, Avon, Bridgewater, Duxbury, Halifax, Hanover, Hanson, Kingston, Marshfield, Pembroke, Plymouth, Plympton, Rockland, West Bridgewater, and Whitman and the new council adopted the Squanto name. =1950-present: Fawn Pond= In the 1940s, the increased number of Scouts in the Squanto Council could no longer be accommodated with the limited facilities at the Bloody Pond site and a search was started for a larger area. In 1948/1949, a site containing several was found which included the north and west shores of Fawn Pond in Plymouth. This land was given to the council by LeBaron R. Barker, a local cranberry grower and landowner. In July 1949 a group of staff leaders and Scouters surveyed the new area and marked out the locations for future development. in the fall of the same year, a formal survey and layout of the camp was made. Since the winter of 1949/1950 was a mild one, many of the Scout troops in the council were able to work at cutting out brush and trees to prepare the sites for buildings and roads. During the spring of 1950, some thirty-five new buildings were put up with the help of construction crews and the Engineering Service of the National Boy Scout Council. The first building constructed was the Director's Lodge, followed by the Staff/Office/Trading Post, and the Health Lodge. The Dining Hall was put up in May and June and was ready for the opening of camp in July. In the meantime, leantos, toilets, a craft building, and winter lodges were built throughout the camp. With the completion of the chapel near the waterfront in the second week of the camp season, the first phase of development in the new camp was over. In addition to the many buildings, a water system, sewage system, unit camping areas, a waterfront area, sports area, campfire/amphitheater, nature study areas, rifle and archery range, and other facilities were set up to make Camp Squanto one of the finest in the United States, a distinction it has maintained throughout the years. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Squanto Spirit made itself evident in many ways. The Feast of Mondamin, an interpretation of the Song of Hiawatha paying tribute to the Great Spirit of the Indian nations, attracted over 2,000 spectators and was broadcast on the Boston television stations. Each of the troops in camp built a mound or small hill, reflecting the activities of various Indian tribes which had contributed to the history and growth of the philosophy of brotherhood which characterizes the Spirit of Squanto. In later years, this Feast of Mondamin was incorporated into the impressive camp opening and closing ceremonies, which are witnessed annually by hundreds of campers, Scout leaders, parents, and families. This yearly reminder of the Spirit which is Squanto continues to be one of the highlights of each camping season at Camp Squanto. The Spirit of Squanto showed itself again during this period, when the adjoining Camp Cachalot was burnt to the ground by a forest fire which ravaged the area, but spared most of Camp Squanto. The staff, Scout campers, and Scout leaders of Camp Cachalot were made welcome at Camp Squanto and shared the camp facilities until their own camp could be rebuilt. One of the most active areas of camp during these years was the waterfront. The natural sandy beach on Fawn Pond was cleaned and extended to provide space for additional aquatic activities. The first watch tower was built out of logs by the camp staff. Later, with funds from the George W. Magee Memorial Fund, a more permanent tower was put up. Although the design of the dock and the composition of the waterfront fleet has changed over the years, some of the original boats and canoes are still in use after providing thousands of hours of pleasure and instruction to many Scouts during the years. Some of the most popular of these watercraft were the \\"whaleboats,\\" old Navy launches which were donated as training craft and swimming platforms. With the opening of camp in July, 1950, a new era of camping in the Squanto Council was initiated. Since then, Camp Squanto has continued to grow, improve, and provide for the needs of Scouts and Scouters. An important factor in this growth has been the Squanto spirit, which has distinguished the camp since its beginnings. This growth has been especially pronounced from 1969 to the present time. In 1970, the Squanto Council and the Old Colony Council merged. The tremendous growth in Scout attendance at camp coupled with the need for year-round building maintenance was recognized, and a year-round camp ranger was hired. Since the new Old Colony council took in most of the South Shore of Massachusetts from Weymouth and Braintree on the north to Plymouth in the south and Walpole on the west with a total of 41 towns, the need for more open space to provide for the needs of the Scouts and Scouters in the area became very real. One of the first acts of the new council was the purchase of additional area abutting Fawn Pond which made it possible for the camp to control two thirds of the land around the pond. An added bonus was the working cranberry bog included in the purchase. With the help of the Order of the Arrow and countless other volunteers, all the camp buildings were repaired and repainted. Camp Resolute Camp Resolute is a camp located on Little Pond in Bolton, Massachusetts. The camp was founded in 1919 on the shores of Little Pond. The facility offers many activities for campers to do such as swimming, boating, hiking, rock climbing, rappelling, and ropes courses. It is the only Boy Scout camp in New England and one of 8 in the country to be accredited by the American Camping Association. Officially named the E. Paul Robsham Scout Reservation, the camp celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2019. The Boy Scout camp occupies one half of the lake while the reservations Cub Scout day camp occupies the other. Tantamous Lodge Mayflower Council's Order of the Arrow lodge is Tantamous #223, which was formed from Old Colony Council's Tisquantum Lodge #164 and Knox Trail Council's Chippanyonk Lodge #59 when the councils merged in 2017.

History Look Again was originally launched in the 1980s as a separate catalogue from Grattan. Despite a successful history, the 1970s was a challenging period for Grattan PLC which led to the appointment of Dave Jones as CEO, a business man who had a strong mail order background. Mr Jones previously worked as Managing Director for the British Mail Order Company, a subsidiary of Great Universal Stores. One of his key observations upon joining the business was that Grattan was still overly reliant on the traditional agency-based catalogue model.Ward, C. (2012) Grattan, Home Shopping for 100 Years, Bradford: Ashford Colour Press Ltd. Grattan then set up three new catalogues, You & Yours, Streets of London and Look Again. These were catalogues that would contact the customer directly, bypassing the agent and cutting out agent commission. In subsequent years the Look Again catalogue allowed Grattan to offer their products to a different customer base, essentially a re-skinned version of the main catalogue that would be sent to previously untargeted customer groups. In 1991 Grattan were acquired by the German mail order group Otto Versand. This takeover included the acquisition of all the different brands under the Grattan group name. Another major catalogue business Freemans was also acquired by the Otto Group in 1999. In January 2013, the Lookagain.co.uk website was re-launched as an online store under the Freemans Grattan Holdings (FGH) group.

Research and career Waterman is one of the founders and current leaders in the area of computational biology. He focuses on applying mathematics, statistics, and computer science techniques to various problems in molecular biology. His work has contributed to some of the most widely used tools in the field. In particular, the Smith- Waterman algorithm (developed with Temple F. Smith) is the basis for many sequence alignment programs. In 1988, Waterman and Eric Lander published a landmark paper describing a mathematical model for fingerprint mapping. This work formed one of the theoretical cornerstones for many of the later DNA mapping and sequencing projects, especially the Human Genome Project. A 1995 paper by Idury and Waterman introduced Eulerian-De Bruijn sequence assembly which is widely used in next-generation sequencing projects. With Pavel A. Pevzner, (a former postdoctoral researcher in his lab) he began the international conference Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB), and he is a founding editor of the Journal of Computational Biology.

Since April 2014, the brand has been owned by Catalyst Capital Group Inc. In May 2020, the company declared for bankruptcy. In June 2020, the intellectual property associated with Advantage Rent a Car and EZ Rent a Car, as well as its operating concessions in Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Miami, Nashville, and Tampa were acquired by Orlando Rentco LLC.  Locations  Advantage operates from 40 locations servicing airports and five additional satellite locations in hotels in Hawaii and Las Vegas, and has a fleet of approximately 23,000 cars, ranging from economy cars to SUVs.  Services  The company primarily services the leisure segment of the rental car market, and predominantly operates in key domestic leisure destinations, including California, Florida, Texas, Colorado, Hawaii, and Arizona (as of July 2013). History In 1963, a small business owned by Kenneth and Helen Walker called ‚Äú$3.99 Car Rentals‚Äù opened its doors to serve the large military population in San Antonio, Texas. Founded with a fleet of five cars, and initially serving the government traveler, it expanded very quickly over the next 20 years into feeder and leisure markets including local retail and airport markets located throughout the Western United States. During the 1960s and 70s, the company grew through the acquisition of several different franchises. The operation was later consolidated in 1984 under the name \\"Advantage Rent a Car.\\" As the 1990s progressed, expansion of the Advantage brand continued throughout the U.S. into the Sunbelt states and major leisure airport markets. In 2001, Advantage attained worldwide presence by launching an affiliate partnership program that grew to an international network serving more than 33 countries. In 2006, following the death of Kenneth Walker, the Walker heirs sold the business to Venture Holding Inc. Bankruptcy and acquisition by Hertz In December 2008, Advantage filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and closed about 40% of its U.S. retail locations, citing \\"a simultaneous drop in leisure travel, with greatly increased costs, and frozen credit markets\\" (presumably an effect of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008). 440 workers, or almost half its workforce, were laid off at the time. Advantage was at that point privately held by disgraced Minnesota auto dealership mogul Denny Hecker (who is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence). On March 31, 2009, the assets of Advantage were purchased by The Hertz Corporation for $33 million, which outbid Enterprise Rent-a-Car in Minnesota bankruptcy court. The purchase included the Advantage logo and website. Hertz stated its intentions after Enterprise had announced it would acquire the assets. The Advantage website was modified to match (or closely mirror) some design and operational aspects of the Hertz website. By fall 2009, Hertz had rebranded its \\"Simply Wheelz\\" economy sub-brand with the acquired Advantage trademark properties, and had largely withdrawn the service. Hertz described its plans to use Advantage for \\"... further expansion into the price-oriented travel demographic\\", \\"... providing Hertz a second brand to sell to corporate accounts and to market with key travel partners\\" and \\"... extending the useful life of vehicles in Hertz's rental fleet for Advantage's fleet needs\\". On November 5, 2013, Advantage announced filed for bankruptcy. As of October 25, 2013 \\"Simply Wheelz\\" sold 5,295 vehicles through auctions with an average loss of about $1,633 per vehicle, which resulted in a total loss of about $8.6 million. Sale and bankruptcy On August 26, 2012, Hertz announced that it had agreed to sell the US Advantage business to Franchise Services of North America and Macquarie Capital, as a divestiture to receive regulatory approval of Hertz's acquisition of Dollar Thrifty, announced at the same time, and to convert foreign Advantage-branded locations to a new Firefly Car Rental brand. On December 12, 2012, Advantage Rent A Car was acquired by a subsidiary of Macquarie Capital, which was to be merged with Franchise Services of North America, Inc. (TSXV:FSN) immediately after a shareholder vote scheduled for 1Q13. The merger received final TSX regulatory and shareholder approval on May 3, 2013. In April 2014, Advantage was acquired by its current owner, Catalyst Capital Group Inc., a Canadian investment firm based in Toronto. On May 26, 2020, the company announced filed for bankruptcy for a third time.

It is located at 400 East 8th Avenue. On December 3, 1969, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is open free-of-charge for scheduled tours, and also hosts special public events. History This building is located in Denver on the southeast corner of 8th Avenue and Logan Street. The exact address is 400 E. 8th Avenue. The Governor's Mansion is also known as the Cheesman-Evans- Boettcher Mansion for its former owners. The building was built in 1908 after a design by Denver architects Willis A. Marean and Albert J. Norton. The house was originally built as a residence for the widow and the daughter of Denver real estate tycoon Walter Scott Cheesman. The mansion was designed to accommodate two families. On November 8, 1908, Cheesman's daughter, Gladys, married John Evans II, the grandson of John Evans, the second territorial governor of Colorado. The widowed mother and young couple lived together until the birth of the Evans' first child, after which they relocated. On January 2, 1923, Alice Foster Sanger Cheesman died. Claude K. Boettcher purchased the mansion on February 23, 1923. Boettcher was the head of a financial empire that eventually included sugar, livestock, cement, potash, steel, securities, utilities, and transportation. Boettcher was famous for his lavish parties which included President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. Boettcher died on June 9, 1957, and his wife in 1958. The house was inherited by the Boettcher Foundation. The foundation offered the house to the State of Colorado as an Executive Residence. The building needed a great deal of work, and its fate remained uncertain for nine months in 1959 as three agencies of the State rejected the offer. On the last day of 1959, Governor Stephen McNichols accepted the building as a gift to the state. From then until January, 2011, it has been the residence of Governors Stephen L. R. McNichols, John Love, John D.Vanderhoof, Richard D. Lamm, Roy R. Romer, William Owens, and William Ritter. The building was restored in the 1980s under the direction of Edward D.

Hickenlooper's successor, Jared Polis, also chose to only live in the mansion on a part-time basis, staying there during legislative sessions while retaining his home in Boulder as his primary residence.  Architecture  The Cheesman-Evans-Boettcher Mansion is a formal, late Georgian Revival house. The building is surrounded by a wrought iron fence with cannonball finials on the brick posts. The walls of the mansion are red brick. There is a white wooden frosting under a hipped roof with prominent gabled dormers. The cornice is pedimented and dentiled. The west side portico has massive, two-story fluted Ionic columns. There is a dramatic entry way with grouped columns that support a porch which becomes a balustraded second-story balcony. The semicircular sunroom was added by suggestion of Mrs. Cheesman in 1915, and it overlooks a small park now known as \\"Governor's Park\\".Thomas J.

The museum was designed by C.F. M√∏ller (1898-1988) in 1976. The apse in Ribe Cathedral (Denmark) decorated by Carl-Henning Pedersen Carl-Henning Pedersen (23 September 1913 - 20 February 2007) was a Danish painter and a key member of the COBRA movement. He was known as the \\"Scandinavian Chagall\\", and was one of the leading Danish artists of the second half of the 20th century.  Biography  Pedersen was born in Copenhagen and brought up in the poor area near Vigerslev Alle. He held radical political beliefs. He joined the International Folk High School in Elsinore in 1933, where he met self-taught painter Else Alfelt. They married in 1934, and their first daughter, Vibeke Alfelt, was born later that year. Alfelt encouraged Pedersen to paint, and he first exhibited at the Artists' Autumn Exhibition (Kunstnernes Efter√•rsudstilling) in Copenhagen in 1936, where he showed four abstract works. His modernist style was at odds with the socialist realism preferred by his communist friends, who snubbed him and he argued with Bertolt Brecht about his art. His abstract works, with flat planes of colour, emulated the works of cubists and of Paul Klee. Pedersen travelled on foot to Paris in 1939, where he saw works by Picasso and Matisse. He visited the exhibition of \\"degenerate art\\" (entartete Kunst) in Frankfurt am Main on his way home, where he was inspired by the paintings on show, particularly the works of Chagall, which remained a strong influence on his art for the rest of his life. His second daughter, Kari-Nina, was born in 1940. He joined the H√∏st group during the Nazi occupation of Denmark, writing about medieval Danish murals for its journal, Helhesten, and continued to produce seditiously modern abstract works. He and his wife were amongst the founding members of the CoBrA movement in 1948. The movement took its name from the European cities where its founders were based: Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam. They both remained with the group until it dissolved in 1951, producing free-form, spontaneous images in strong, fantastic colours. He won the Eckersberg Award in 1950 and the Guggenheim Award in 1958. A retrospective was put on at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh in 1961, and he was Denmark's representative at the Venice Biennale in 1962. He won the Thorvaldsen Medal in 1963. Pedersen moved into monumental art in the 1960s and 1970s, producing a large mosaic, \\"Cosmic Sea\\", for the H. C. √òrsted Institute at Copenhagen University, and a huge tiled wall decoration, \\"Fantasy Play Around the Wheel of Life\\", for the Angli courtyard in Herning for example. Else Alfelt died in 1974. Notorious for resisting selling his works, he donated thousands to the Carl-Henning Pedersen and Else Alfelt Museum, which opened in Herning in 1976. Further works were donated to the Danish National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst) in early 2007. He moved to Burgundy in the 1980s, but most of his work still came from Danish sources. He surprised many when he worked on the redecoration of the Gothic cathedral in Ribe, working on the murals, painted glass and mosaics to illustrate Bible stories from 1983 to 1987. He also produced bronze sculptures, and works in oils and watercolour. He died in Copenhagen, after a long illness. He was survived by his second wife, Sidsel Ramson.

It is located at the East lawn of the Capitol, at the end of Capital Avenue. On February 1, 1972, it was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places. The mansion, as seen from the adjacent Capitol lawn It was built in 1912‚Äì14 to be the governor's mansion, to designs submitted by Weber, Werner & Adkins of Cincinnati, Ohio. The politically- connected Weber Brothers, Edward Addison WeberEdward A. Weber: \\"He was a leading architect in northern Kentucky and for eleven years was a member of the Kentucky legislature.\\" and Christian C. Weber, received and handled the commission officially. However because neither appears to have any architectural or design training, \\"the actual designer appears to have been John Scudder Adkins (1872-1931), a well-trained and talented St. Louis-born architect who moved to Cincinnati in 1893.\\" Adkins designed several notable commercial and institutional buildings as well as residences throughout the mid-west. John Adkins and G.S. Werner were partners in a firm prior to merging with as the Weber brothers' firm. The firm was selected from among four firms invited to submit plans.The partners were also responsible for the Stephen A. Gerrard Mansion in Cincinnati and the twelve-storey Lafayette Hotel, Franklin, built in 1920‚Äì21 (John D. Wright, Lexington Heart of the Bluegrass: An Illustrated History [University Press of Kentucky] 1997:147), now the LFUCG Government Center, and on the National Register of Historic Places since 1983. The new mansion replaced the Old Governor's Mansion, built in 1798, which still stands, at 420 High Street, Frankfort. The Act specified that the new mansion should be \\"constructed, trimmed and finished with native stone produced from quarries in Kentucky.\\" The Beaux-Arts design owed a great deal to the Petit Trianon at Versailles' interiors were in neoclassical French taste. The landscaping design for the mansion was developed and implemented by William SpeedKentucky Division of Historic Properties: The Capitol of Kentucky: A Brief Introduction of Louisville. In 1980, Kentucky's First Lady, Phyllis George Brown, began a fundraising effort called Save the Mansion, designed to fund the restoration of the interior and furnish the building. The restoration project was completed in the spring of 1983. The Governor's Mansion Preservation Foundation is a charitable trust that is charged with conservation of the historic structure. The Governor's Mansion is regularly open for tours.

Selva Bharathy. The film has Vijay and Simran playing the lead roles, with S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, Vivek and Radhika Chaudhari in supporting roles. The film revolves around a working woman in a struggling family and portrays the sufferings she receives from her NRI husband with non-Indian cultural shades in his role but he later realises about the importance of Indian marriage and becomes a loving and caring husband. The film released on 26 October 2000. This film is the Tamil remake of the 1996 Telugu film Pavitra Bandham starring Daggubati Venkatesh and Soundarya.https://chaibisket.com/vijay-movies-in-telugu-cinema/ Plot Vijay is the only son of a rich industrialist, Vishwanathan. Having pursued his education abroad, he is highly Westernised and spends his time partying and enjoying with his friends Chandru and Sowmya instead of managing his father's business. Moreover, he has no faith in the institution of marriage. When Vishwanathan decides to get Vijay married in order to make him more responsible, Vijay agrees under the condition that the marriage is valid only for one year, and that he will decide if he wants to continue the marriage after that. Vishwanathan is upset at this as he feels that no girl will accepts the conditions put forth by Vijay. He explains his situation to his personal assistant, Priya, and requests her to marry him, with the idea that Priya would be able to change Vijay and make him more responsible. Priya initially refuses on knowing about Vijay's agreement. However, she is the sole breadwinner of her family. She has an elder sister who needs to undergo a heart surgery, a younger sister who needs to get married, and a younger brother, Shankar, who is unemployed. So she decides to sacrifice her life and marry Vijay, accepting the conditions of his agreement, for the sake of her family. Vijay and Priya become good friends after marriage, however, Vijay refuses to consider Priya as his wife. On Priya's insistence, Vijay decides to work in his father's office, where he gets to know about the money siphoning made by his office employees Manohar, who is an associate of Vijay, and 7 Times, Priya's crude and uncouth uncle who lusts for her. He dismisses them and lodges a police complaint against them. In retribution, Manohar and 7 Times orchestrate a car accident, severely injuring Vijay. Priya takes good care of Vijay and Vijay soon recovers. During their first wedding anniversary, Vijay, to everyone's shock, decides to end their marriage as per his agreement, claiming that he only considered Priya as a friend and never as a wife, and drops Priya back to her home. Priya is deeply hurt by Vijay's behaviour, and she also gets verbally harassed by many men for accepting an \\"agreement\\" marriage. Vijay continues his carefree lifestyle for some more days until he sees an old beggar carrying his paralysed wife on his back and begging at a traffic signal. When questioned, the beggar says that even though his wife cannot recover, it is his duty to look after her till her death. This incident makes Vijay realise his mistake, understand the Indian culture and feel guilty that even an old and poor beggar can take care of his wife, while he could not. He rushes to Priya's home, apologises to her and requests her to return to him. But Priya refuses as her faith in Vijay has been shattered. Meanwhile, Manohar and 7 Times again attempt to cause trouble for Vijay, prompting him to get them arrested. Priya gets a job at another company. Vijay takes over that company, even though it is running under heavy loss, so that Priya will work in his company as his personal assistant. But Priya refuses to talk to Vijay and snubs all of his efforts to reconcile with her. Priya soon realises that she is pregnant. She invites Vijay, Vishwanathan and her company employees to her Seemantham. However, she uses the Seemantham function as an opportunity to insult Vijay and Vishwanathan, revealing to all the guests present that Vijay is her husband and left her after one year as per his agreement. Vijay retaliates by saying that Priya did marry him and accepted the conditions in his agreement, not out of love for him, or not with the intention to reform him, but to use his money to fix the various issues in her family, and leaves the function with his father. As a last-ditch resort, Vijay, Chandru, Shankar and Vijay's driver Stepnee, hatch a plan to bring back Priya to Vijay. They decide to lie to Priya that Vijay is stabbed by his ex- employees Manohar and 7 Times whom he had sent to jail earlier so that Priya will change her mind and unite with Vijay. When Priya find out about the trick, she rushes to Vijay's home to admonish him for his cheap behaviour. But it turns out that Manohar and 7 Times really escaped from prison and stabbed Vijay. When Priya realises that Vijay is really wounded and attempts to help, she goes into labour. Vijay manages to drive Priya to the hospital despite his condition. Priya gives birth to a baby boy, while Vijay is operated upon and manages to recover. In the end, Vijay and Priya reunite again. Cast *Vijay as Vijay *Simran as Priya *Radhika Chaudhari as Sowmya *S.

The equations were originally discovered in the context of surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space. In this context, the first equation, often called the Gauss equation (after its discoverer Carl Friedrich Gauss), says that the Gauss curvature of the surface, at any given point, is dictated by the derivatives of the Gauss map at that point, as encoded by the second fundamental form.This equation is the basis for Gauss's theorema egregium. . The second equation, called the Codazzi equation or Codazzi-Mainardi equation, states that the covariant derivative of the second fundamental form is fully symmetric. It is named for Gaspare Mainardi (1856) and Delfino Codazzi (1868‚Äì1869), who independently derived the result,. although it was discovered earlier by Karl Mikhailovich Peterson.. Formal statement Let i \\\\colon M \\\\subset P be an n-dimensional embedded submanifold of a Riemannian manifold P of dimension n+p. There is a natural inclusion of the tangent bundle of M into that of P by the pushforward, and the cokernel is the normal bundle of M: :0\\\\rightarrow T_xM \\\\rightarrow T_xP_M \\\\rightarrow T_x^\\\\perp M\\\\rightarrow 0. The metric splits this short exact sequence, and so :TP_M = TM\\\\oplus T^\\\\perp M. Relative to this splitting, the Levi-Civita connection abla' of P decomposes into tangential and normal components. For each X\\\\in TM and vector field Y on M, : abla'_X Y = \\\\top( abla'_X Y) + \\\\bot( abla'_X Y). Let : abla_X Y = \\\\top( abla'_X Y),\\\\quad \\\\alpha(X,Y) = \\\\bot( abla'_X Y). The Gauss formulaTerminology from Spivak, Volume III. now asserts that abla_X is the Levi-Civita connection for M, and \\\\alpha is a symmetric vector-valued form with values in the normal bundle. It is often referred to as the second fundamental form. An immediate corollary is the Gauss equation. For X, Y, Z, W \\\\in TM, :\\\\langle R'(X,Y)Z, W\\\\rangle = \\\\langle R(X,Y)Z, W\\\\rangle + \\\\langle \\\\alpha(X,Z), \\\\alpha(Y,W)\\\\rangle -\\\\langle \\\\alpha(Y,Z), \\\\alpha(X,W)\\\\rangle where R' is the Riemann curvature tensor of P and R is that of M. The Weingarten equation is an analog of the Gauss formula for a connection in the normal bundle. Let X\\\\in TM and \\\\xi a normal vector field. Then decompose the ambient covariant derivative of \\\\xi along X into tangential and normal components: : abla'_X\\\\xi=\\\\top ( abla'_X\\\\xi) + \\\\bot( abla'_X\\\\xi) = -A_\\\\xi(X) + D_X(\\\\xi). Then # Weingarten's equation: \\\\langle A_\\\\xi X, Y\\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\alpha(X,Y), \\\\xi\\\\rangle # DX is a metric connection in the normal bundle. There are thus a pair of connections: ‚àá, defined on the tangent bundle of M; and D, defined on the normal bundle of M. These combine to form a connection on any tensor product of copies of TM and T‚ä•M. In particular, they defined the covariant derivative of \\\\alpha: :(\\\\tilde{ abla}_X \\\\alpha)(Y,Z) = D_X\\\\left(\\\\alpha(Y,Z)\\\\right) - \\\\alpha( abla_X Y,Z) - \\\\alpha(Y, abla_X Z). The Codazzi‚ÄìMainardi equation is :\\\\bot\\\\left(R'(X,Y)Z\\\\right) = (\\\\tilde{ abla}_X\\\\alpha)(Y,Z) - (\\\\tilde{ abla}_Y\\\\alpha)(X,Z). Since every immersion is, in particular, a local embedding, the above formulas also hold for immersions. Gauss‚ÄìCodazzi equations in classical differential geometry=Statement of classical equations In classical differential geometry of surfaces, the Codazzi‚ÄìMainardi equations are expressed via the second fundamental form (L, M, N): :L_v-M_u=L\\\\Gamma^1{}_{12} + M(\\\\Gamma^2{}_{12}-\\\\Gamma^1{}_{11}) - N\\\\Gamma^2{}_{11} :M_v- N_u=L\\\\Gamma^1{}_{22} + M(\\\\Gamma^2{}_{22}-\\\\Gamma^1{}_{12}) - N\\\\Gamma^2{}_{12} The Gauss formula, depending on how one chooses to define the Gaussian curvature, may be a tautology. It can be stated as :K=\\\\frac{LN-M^2}{eg-f^2}, where (e, f, g) are the components of the first fundamental form. Derivation of classical equations Consider a parametric surface in Euclidean 3-space, :\\\\mathbf{r}(u,v) = (x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v)) where the three component functions depend smoothly on ordered pairs (u,v) in some open domain U in the uv-plane. Assume that this surface is regular, meaning that the vectors ru and rv are linearly independent. Complete this to a basis{ru,rv,n}, by selecting a unit vector n normal to the surface. It is possible to express the second partial derivatives of r using the Christoffel symbols and the second fundamental form. :\\\\mathbf{r}_{uu}=\\\\Gamma^1{}_{11} \\\\mathbf{r}_u + \\\\Gamma^2{}_{11} \\\\mathbf{r}_v + L \\\\mathbf{n} :\\\\mathbf{r}_{uv}=\\\\Gamma^1{}_{12} \\\\mathbf{r}_u + \\\\Gamma^2{}_{12} \\\\mathbf{r}_v + M \\\\mathbf{n} :\\\\mathbf{r}_{vv}=\\\\Gamma^1{}_{22} \\\\mathbf{r}_u + \\\\Gamma^2{}_{22} \\\\mathbf{r}_v + N \\\\mathbf{n} Clairaut's theorem states that partial derivatives commute: :\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_{uu}\\\\right)_v=\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}_{uv}\\\\right)_u If we differentiate ruu with respect to v and ruv with respect to u, we get: :\\\\left(\\\\Gamma^1{}_{11}\\\\right)_v \\\\mathbf{r}_u + \\\\Gamma^1{}_{11} \\\\mathbf{r}_{uv} + \\\\left(\\\\Gamma^2{}_{11}\\\\right)_v \\\\mathbf{r}_v + \\\\Gamma^2{}_{11} \\\\mathbf{r}_{vv} + L_v \\\\mathbf{n} + L \\\\mathbf{n}_v = \\\\left(\\\\Gamma^1{}_{12}\\\\right)_u \\\\mathbf{r}_u + \\\\Gamma^1{}_{12} \\\\mathbf{r}_{uu} + \\\\left(\\\\Gamma_{12}^2\\\\right)_u \\\\mathbf{r}_v + \\\\Gamma^2{}_{12} \\\\mathbf{r}_{uv} + M_u \\\\mathbf{n} + M \\\\mathbf{n}_u Now substitute the above expressions for the second derivatives and equate the coefficients of n: : M \\\\Gamma^1{}_{11} + N \\\\Gamma^2{}_{11} + L_v = L \\\\Gamma^1{}_{12} + M \\\\Gamma^2{}_{12} + M_u Rearranging this equation gives the first Codazzi‚ÄìMainardi equation. The second equation may be derived similarly. Mean curvature Let M be a smooth m-dimensional manifold immersed in the (m + k)-dimensional smooth manifold P. Let e_1,e_2,\\\\ldots, e_k be a local orthonormal frame of vector fields normal to M. Then we can write, :\\\\alpha(X,Y) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^k\\\\alpha_j(X,Y)e_j If, now, E_1,E_2,\\\\ldots,E_m is a local orthonormal frame (of tangent vector fields) on the same open subset of M, then we can define the mean curvatures of the immersion by :H_j=\\\\sum_{i=1}^m\\\\alpha_j(E_i,E_i) In particular, if M is a hypersurface of P, i.e. k=1, then there is only one mean curvature to speak of. The immersion is called minimal if all the H_j are identically zero. Observe that the mean curvature is a trace, or average, of the second fundamental form, for any given component. Sometimes mean curvature is defined by multiplying the sum on the right-hand side by 1/m. We can now write the Gauss‚ÄìCodazzi equations as :\\\\langle R'(X,Y)Z, W\\\\rangle = \\\\langle R(X,Y)Z, W \\\\rangle + \\\\sum_{j=1}^k \\\\alpha_j(X,Z) \\\\alpha_j(Y,W) - \\\\alpha_j(Y,Z) \\\\alpha_j(X,W) Contracting the Y,Z components gives us : \\\\operatorname{Ric}'(X, W) = \\\\operatorname{Ric}(X,W) + \\\\sum_{j=1}^k \\\\langle R'(X,e_j)e_j,W\\\\rangle+ \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^m\\\\alpha_j(X,E_i) \\\\alpha_j(E_i,W)\\\\right) - H_j \\\\alpha_j(X,W) Observe that the tensor in parentheses is symmetric and nonnegative-definite in X,W. Assuming that M is a hypersurface, this simplifies to : \\\\operatorname{Ric}'(X, W) = \\\\operatorname{Ric}(X,W) + \\\\langle R'(X,n)n,W\\\\rangle+ \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^mh(X,E_i) h(E_i,W)\\\\right) - H h(X,W) where n = e_1 and h = \\\\alpha_1 and H = H_1. In that case, one more contraction yields, : R' = R + 2 \\\\operatorname{Ric}'(n,n)+ \\\\h\\\\^2 - H^2 where R' and R are the respective scalar curvatures, and :\\\\h\\\\^2 = \\\\sum_{i,j=1}^m h(E_i,E_j)^2 If k>1, the scalar curvature equation might be more complicated. We can already use these equations to draw some conclusions. For example, any minimal immersion into the round sphere x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\\\cdots + x_{m+k+1}^2 = 1 must be of the form :\\\\Delta x_j + \\\\lambda x_j = 0 where j runs from 1 to m+k+1 and :\\\\Delta = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m abla_{E_i} abla_{E_i} is the Laplacian on M, and \\\\lambda>0 is a positive constant.

It is located in downtown Jackson, Mississippi, south of the Mississippi State Capitol, at the south end of Smith Park. Completed in 1841 to a design by state architect William Nichols, it is the second-oldest governor's residence in active use in the nation, and a prominent example of Greek Revival architecture. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975, and and was declared a Mississippi Landmark in 1985. Description The Mississippi Governor's Mansion is located three blocks south of the Mississippi State Capitol, on that take up an entire city block, bounded by East Amite, North Congress, East Capitol, and North West Streets. Its formal entrance is oriented south towards East Capitol Street, while a secondary entrance faces north toward Smith Park, Jackson's oldest public park, which occupies the next city block to the north. It is a two-story masonry structure painted white, basically rectangular in plan. Its front facade is five bays wide, each bay articulated by pilasters with scrolled capitals; bays on the side elevations are separated by doubled pilasters. The center bay is larger, and is fronted by a two-story half-round portico supported by four columns. A full entablature encircles the building, ending in a dentillated cornice below the roof line. The rear entrance, set at the back of a modern two-story ell, is sheltered by a single-story Greek temple portico with four columns, entablature, and gabled pediment. The interior of the mansion's original main block contains many original features, although there are also elements that have been reproduced, a product of restoration work after incompatible changes were made to the building in the 19th and 20th centuries. The main entrance leads into an octagonal vestibule with sculpture niches in four walls, entrances to parlors on the sides, and passage to the main stair at the back. The modern wing at the back of the house provides amenities for the governor's family, and serves as its living quarters. History The mansion was designed by William Nichols, then in his capacity as state architect. Nichols was at the same time supervising the construction of what is now the Old Mississippi State Capitol. Construction was begun in 1839 and completed in 1841; its first occupant was Governor Tilghman Tucker in 1842. It has been used continuously since then as the governor's residence, except during periods of renovation; the only older governor's residence of longer use is that of Virginia. During the 1860s the building was fitted with gas lighting, which resulted in damage to woodwork and plasterwork, and some of its wooden fireplace surrounds were replaced by marble ones. In the early 20th century there was talk of replacing the mansion, but the state decided instead to renovate and enlarge the structure. A two-story addition was made to the rear in 1908‚Äì09, plumbing was added to the main block, and the main stair was rebuilt to accommodate access to the addition. In the 1970s it again needed major refurbishment, owing in part to inadequate support for the 1908 addition. It was torn down, and a new and larger steel-frame addition was made. The interior of the main block underwent some restoration to bring it back to its original early 19th-century appearance, including the removal of visible pipes, while also adding modern conveniences such as air conditioning. Visiting The mansion is open for free guided tours most Tuesday through Friday mornings, unless there are official functions or other uses of the building scheduled. Certain types of educational non-profit organizations may hold events at the mansion; a fee is charged.

Historically a single pot still whiskey, the flagship Powers Gold Label brand was the first Irish whiskey ever to be bottled. In recent years, several single pot still variants have been relaunched under the Powers label. Historically, Powers Gold Label was the best-selling whiskey in Ireland.  History  John's Lane Distillery, circa 1887. In 1791 James Power, an innkeeper from Dublin, established a small distillery at his public house at 109 Thomas St., Dublin. The distillery, which had an output of about 6,000 gallons in its first year of operation, initially traded as James Power and Son, but by 1822 had become John Power & Son, and had moved to a new premises at John's Lane, a side street off Thomas Street. At the time the distillery had three pot stills, though only one, a 500-gallon still is thought to have been in use. Following reform of the distilling laws in 1823, the distillery expanded rapidly. In 1827, production was reported at 160,270 gallons, and by 1833 had grown to 300,000 gallons per annum. As the distillery grew, so too did the stature of the family. In 1841, John Power, grandson of the founder was awarded a baronetcy, a hereditary title. In 1855, his son Sir James Power, laid the foundation stone for the O'Connell Monument, and in 1859 became High Sheriff of Dublin. In 1871, the distillery was expanded and rebuilt in the Victorian style, becoming one of the most impressive sights in Dublin. After expansion, output at the distillery rose to 700,000 gallons per annum, and by the 1880s, had reached about 900,000 gallons per annum, at which point the distillery covered over six acres of central Dublin, and had a staff of about 300 people. The Still House at John's Lane Distillery, as it looked when Alfred Barnard visited in the 1800s. During this period, when the Dublin whiskey distilleries were amongst the largest in the world, the family-run firms of John Powers, along with John Jameson, William Jameson, and George Roe, (collectively known as the \\"Big Four\\") came to dominate the Irish distilling landscape, introducing several innovations. In 1886, John Power & Son began bottling their own whiskey, rather than following the practice customary at the time, of selling whiskey directly to merchants and bonders who would bottle it themselves. They were the first Dublin distillery to do so, and one of the first in the world. A gold label adorned each bottle and it was from these that the whiskey got the name Powers Gold Label. When Alfred Barnard, the British historian visited John's Lane in the late 1880s, he noted the elegance and cleanliness of the buildings, and the modernity of the distillery, describing it as \\"about as complete a work as it is possible to find anywhere\\". At the time of his visit, the distillery was home to five pot stills, two of which with capacities of 25,000 gallons, were amongst the largest ever built. In addition, Barnard was high in his praise for Powers whiskey, noting: > The old make, which we drank with our luncheon, was delicious, and finer > than anything we had hitherto tasted. It was as perfect in flavour, and as > pronounced in the ancient aroma of Irish Whisky so dear to the hearts of > connoisseurs, as one could possibly desire, and we found a small flask of it > very useful afterwards on our travels. The last member of the family to sit on the board was Sir Thomas Talbot Power, who died in 1930, and with him the Power's Baronetcy. However, ownership remained in the family until 1966, and several descendants of his sisters remained at work with the company until recent times. In 1961, a Coffey still was installed in John's Lane Distillery, allowing the production of vodka and gin, in addition to the testing of grain whiskey for use in blended whiskey. This was a notable departure for the firm, as for many years the big Dublin distilling dynasties had shunned the use of Coffey stills, questioning if their output, grain whiskey, could even be termed whiskey. However, with many of the Irish distilleries having closed in the early 20th century in part due to their failure to embrace a change in consumer preference towards blended whiskey, Powers were instrumental in convincing the remaining Irish distilleries to reconsider their stance on blended whiskey. In 1966, with the Irish whiskey industry still struggling following Prohibition in the United States, the Anglo-Irish Trade War and the rise of competition from Scotch whiskey, John Powers & Son joined forces with the only other remaining distillers in the Irish Republic, the Cork Distilleries Company and their Dublin rivals John Jameson & Son, to form Irish Distillers. Soon after, in a bold move, Irish Distillers decided to close all of their existing distilleries, and to consolidate production at a new purpose-built facility in Midleton (the New Midleton Distillery) alongside their existing Old Midleton Distillery. The new distillery opened in 1975, and a year later, production ceased at John's Lane Distillery and began anew in Cork, with Powers Gold Label and many other Irish whiskeys reformulated from single pot stills whiskeys to blends. In 1989, Irish Distillers itself became a subsidiary of Pernod-Ricard following a friendly takeover. Since the closure of the John's Lane distillery, many of the distillery buildings were demolished. However, some of the buildings have been incorporated into the National College of Art and Design, and are now protected structures. In addition, three of the distillery's pot stills were saved and now located in the college's Red Square.

His legacy lies primarily in his instituting the Panathenaic Games, historically assigned the date of 566 BC, and the consequent first attempt at producing a definitive version of the Homeric epics. Peisistratos' championing of the lower class of Athens, the Hyperakrioi (see below), is an early example of populism. While in power, Peisistratos did not hesitate to confront the aristocracy, and he greatly reduced their privileges, confiscated their lands and gave them to the poor and funded many religious and artistic programs.Shanaysha M. Furlow Sauls (2008). The Concept of Instability and the Theory of Democracy in the , p. 77 He did so with the goal of improving the economy and spreading the wealth more equally among the Athenians. Peisistratus was a one-time brother-in-law of Cleisthenes; however, Peisistratos was much older. Peisistratids is the common term for the three tyrants who ruled in Athens from 546 to 510 BC, namely Peisistratos and his two sons, Hipparchus and Hippias. Rise Illustration from 1838 by M. A. Barth depicting the return of Peisistratos to Athens, accompanied by a woman dressed as Athena, as described by the Greek historian Herodotus Peisistratos was a distant relative of Solon from northern Attica. He had made a name for himself by capturing the port of Nisaea in nearby Megara by creating a successful coup in 565 BC.Chester G. Starr, ENCYCLOP√ÜDIA BRITANNICA Peisistratus TYRANT OF ATHENS Peisistratos was backed by the Men of the Hill, the poorer and majority of the population. This victory opened up the unofficial trade blockage that had been contributing to food shortages in Athens during the previous several decades.Sarah B. Pomeroy, Stanley M. Burstein, Walter Donlan, Jennifer Tolbert Roberts, David Tandy, Ancient Greece: a political, social, and cultural history(United States of America: 2012) Oxford University Press, New York, p191-2025 In the period after the Megaran defeat, several political factions competed for control in the government of Athens. These groups were both economically and geographically partitioned.Aristotle, The Athenian Constitution, Part 13 *Pedieis: the population that resided on the plains, led by Lycurgus. These landowners produced grain, giving them leverage during the food shortage. *Paralioi: the population living along the coast, led by Megacles, an Alcmaeonid, the Paralioi party was not as strong as the Pedieis, primarily because they could not produce grain, as did the plainsmen. With the Megareans patrolling the sea, much of Athens' import/export power was limited. *Hyperakrioi: not previously represented by formal party, dwelled primarily in the hills and were by far the poorest of the Athenian population. Their only production was barter in items like honey and wool. Peisistratos organised them into the Hyperakrioi, or hill dwellers. This party grossly outnumbered the other two parties combined. His role in the Megarian conflict gained Peisistratos popularity in Athens, but he did not have the political clout to seize power. Herodotus tells us how he intentionally wounded himself and his mules in order to demand from the Athenian people bodyguards for protection, which he received. By obtaining support from the vast number of the poorer population as well as bodyguards, he was able to seize the Acropolis and the reins of government. The Athenians were open to a tyranny similar to that under Solon ‚Äì and possible stability and internal peace ‚Äì and Peisistratos' ruse won him further prominence. With this in his possession, and the collusion of Megacles and his party, he declared himself tyrant.Aristotle, The Athenian Constitution, Part 13; Herodotus, The Histories, 1.59; Plutarch, ‚ÄúLife of Solon‚Äù, in Plutarch‚Äôs Lives (London: Printed by W. M'Dowell for J. Davis, 1812), 185. Despite the success of his takeover he only maintained power for a short period finding himself fighting for power once again a short 2 years later. Periods of power Peisistratos was ousted from political office and exiled twice during his reign. The first occurrence was circa 555 BC after the two original parties, normally at odds with each other, joined forces and removed Peisistratos from power. Actual dates after this point become unclear. Peisistratos was exiled for 3 to 6 years during which the agreement between the Pedieis and the Paralioi fell apart. Peisistratos returned to Athens and rode into the city in a golden chariot accompanied by a tall woman dressed as Athena. It is debated to what extent this impacted the return of many to his side. Whilst some argue that the general public believed he had won the favour of the goddess, others instead put forward the idea that the public were aware that Peisistratos was using the chariot ride as a political manoeuvre, drawing comparisons between himself and the ancient kings of Athens.Aristotle, The Athenian Constitution, Part 14; Herodotus, The Histories, 1.60. Differing sources state that he held the tyranny for one to six years before he was exiled again. During his second exile, he gathered support from local cities and resources from the Laurion silver mines in Attica. He also raised money in the Pangaion region during his second exile which assisted in helping him regain his power. After 10 years he returned in force, regained his tyranny, and held power until his death in 527 BC. With his passing, the rule of Athens fell to his oldest son Hippias for the short period before the end of the Peisistratids tyranny. Peisistratus was a Greek tyrant having overthrown the democracy by force. He achieved this by using his strong mercenary force in dissuading and killing all the other aristocrats. To ensure his ruling he maintained his strong mercenary force to act as his private bodyguards who reported directly to him. In addition, to dissuade other political families, Peisistratus held hostages from the major families to ensure cooperation. Unlike many tyrants, Peisistratus maintained the government's structure as opposed to removing it entirely, choosing to rather improve and evolve the current system. By doing so he was able to keep many of the aristocrats in seats of power by allowing only those who cooperated to take places as Archons, while the others were sentenced to exile. With the government being run by a trusted group, he had comfortable control over all rulings and personal protection from the law.  Construction and contribution in Athens  During his rule in Athens, Peisistratos headed the construction of many great projects. Peisistratos was one of the first tyrants to heavily focus on the infrastructure of Athens, his building of wells specifically was greatly appreciated by the masses. Additionally he constructed great monuments like the one believed to be his home at the temple of Apollo. This idea of using the states collective money to fund such projects was one which would be used by nearly all future leaders due to the effectiveness and impact it made on the citizens of Athens. During the period of 561-527 BC, \\"Athens itself was becoming more of a city, rather than an agglomeration of villages\\". Athens had always struggled with water supply. This was greatly improved during the rule of Peisistratos through the construction of an aqueduct. The market in Athens prior to Peisistratos was disorderly and inefficient. He improved this by reconstructing the market to be laid out systematically to improve the effectivesness and use of space. Peisistratos also began the construction of a Temple to Zeus. Despite his efforts he was unable to complete the construction, and the temple was finally completed during the Roman era by Roman emperor Hadrian. One of the largest changes was the shift in agriculture implemented by Solon to encourage the growth of more profitable crops, such as olives, over less profitable crops that did not perform as well in the local climate. Peisistratos promoted these endeavours by creating financing options for farmers to access tools needed to maximize their production. With many exiled aristocrats still attempting to maintain control over large sections of land, which was supposed to be broken up. However, Peisistratos took additional measures to ensure the equal distribution. He achieved this by bringing legal action out of Athens, by having traveling judges handle the inspection and legal cases regarding farm land in rural areas. A collection of mountains and hills in Greece filled with Silver Mines. Peisistratos financed a majority of the upgrades in Athens through silver mines to pay for the construction that came with the newly expanding political culture. \\"Most of the revenues were gained from the mines of Mount Pangaeum\\". According to the Encyclopedia Britannica the silver mines of Laurium were state property, and all dues were exacted from the growing trade at Athenian harbours. Another route of financing that Peisistratos pursued was a tax which was focused on the agriculture sectors, this tax was estimated to be around 5%.All of the money produced through these sources was instrumental in developing the Athenian economy setting them up for success throughout the latter 6th Century. In addition to this his political movements to protect immigrants and improve the quality of life in Athens were very important in maintaining their strong economy. Popular tyrant As opposed to the modern definition of a tyrant, which is a single ruler, often violent and oppressive, Peisistratos' career was a model example of tyranny, a non-heritable position taken by purely personal ability, often in violation of tradition or constitutional norms. We see this in remarks by both Herodotus and Aristotle. Herodotus, in his Histories, wrote that Peisistratos, \\"not having disturbed the existing magistrates nor changed the ancient laws‚Ä¶ administered the State under that constitution of things which was already established, ordering it fairly and well\\", while Aristotle wrote that \\"his administration was temperate‚Ä¶and more like constitutional government than a tyranny\\".Aristotle, The Athenian Constitution, Part 16.2. Peisistratos often tried to distribute power and benefits rather than hoard them, with the intent of easing stress between the economic classes. The elites who had held power in the Areopagus Council were allowed to retain their archonships. For the lower classes, he cut taxes and created a band of travelling judges to provide justice for the citizens. Peisistratos enacted a popular program to beautify Athens and promote the arts. He minted coins with Athena's symbol (the owl), although this was only one type on the so-called Wappenm√ºnzen (heraldic coins) and not a regular device as on the later, standard silver currency. Under his rule were introduced two new forms of poetry, the dithyramb and tragic drama, and the era also saw growth in theatre, arts, and sculpture. He commissioned the permanent copying and archiving of Homer's two epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey, and the canon of Homeric works is said to derive from this particular archiving. Much of Athens grandeur started with Peisistratos and his push for larger and more luxurious buildings. Three attempts at tyranny With Peisistratos' successful invasion and capture of Nisaea, he attained great political standing in the assembly. He initially met with resistance from nobles like Megacles, the son of Alcmaeon, and Lycurgus, the son of Aristola√Ødes, who had shared power between them. Megacles came over to Peisistratos' side and, with his help, Peisistratos was accepted as tyrant by the Athenian assembly in 561, and, according to Herodotus, he \\"administered the state constitutionally and organized the state's affairs properly and well.\\" However, he was soon thereafter ousted. Herodotus explains his exile ‚ÄúNot much later, however, the supporters of Megacles and those of Lycurgus came to an understanding and expelled him‚Äù. He soon had a second chance. Megacles invited him back in 556 on condition that he marry Megacles' daughter. Peisistratos returned in triumph accompanied by a tall, local woman named Phye, whom he passed off as Athena. The awestruck Athenians thus accepted his second tyranny. Peisistratus, however, refused to impregnate Megacles' daughter not wanting to dilute his families power, which ended their coalition. Peisistratos was forced to leave Attica entirely. During his nearly ten-year exile, he aligned himself with powerful individuals, and accumulated great wealth. With a strong personal army, he marched to Marathon and from there to Athens. His popularity soared and many locals supported him. Thus, in 546 BC, he began his third and final tyranny. With this tyranny being one of the longest lasting tyrannies in classical Greece history. Policies The Athenians celebrating the return of Peisistratos. Peisistratos' main policies were aimed at strengthening the economy, and similar to Solon, he was concerned about both agriculture and commerce. He offered land and loans to the needy. He encouraged the cultivation of olives and the growth of Athenian trade, finding a way to the Black Sea and even Italy and France. Under Peisistratos, fine Attic pottery travelled to Ionia, Cyprus and Syria. In Athens, Peisistratos' public building projects provided jobs to people in need while simultaneously making the city a cultural centre. He replaced the private wells of the aristocrats with public fountain houses. Peisistratos also built the first aqueduct in Athens, opening a reliable water supply to sustain the large population.Sarah B. Pomeroy, Stanley M. Burstein, Walter Donlan, Jennifer Tolbert Roberts, David Tandy, Ancient Greece: a political, social, and cultural history(United States of America: 2012) Oxford University Press, New York, p.191‚Äì2025 Legacy Peisistratos died in 527 or 528 BC. His eldest son, Hippias, succeeded him as tyrant of Athens. Hippias and his brother, Hipparchus, ruled the city much as their father had. After a successful murder plot against Hipparchus conceived by Harmodius and Aristogeiton, Hippias became paranoid and oppressive. This change caused the people of Athens to hold Hippias in much lower regard. The Alcmaeonid family helped depose the tyranny by bribing the Delphic oracle to tell the Spartans to liberate Athens, which they did in 508 BC. The Peisistratids were not executed, but rather were mostly forced into exile. The surviving Peisistratid ruler, Hippias, went on to aid the Persians in their attack on Marathon (490 BC), acting as a guide. After the death of Peisistratus, Athens was much less important politically and with military status compared to Sparta. Nonetheless, the religious and patriotic unification of Athens had made great progress during Peisistratus‚Äôs ruling. As Aristotle reports, it became a common saying that the tyranny of Peisistratus had been the age of Cronus, the golden age. The poet Dante in Purgatorio XV of the Comedia uses Peisistratos as an example of meekness since he was well known for being able to placate wrath with a gentle answer. According to Suda the bodyguards of Peisistratos were called wolf-feet (ŒõœÖŒ∫œåœÄŒøŒ¥ŒµœÇ), because they always had their feet covered with wolf-skins, to prevent frostbite; alternatively because they had a wolf symbol on their shields.Suda, la.812 See also *Herodotus *Histories *Aristotle *Politics NotesReferences *Berti, Monica.

SAK runs an improv training school, SAK University (SAK U), which features four levels of core classes and two advanced Conservatory classes  Shows  SAK's main show is the Duel of Fools. This show features two teams of three improvisers, one host/ referee, and a piano player to add music. SAK will often feature a different ten p.m. show that offers a different format other than the standard Duel of Fools. While Duel of Fools runs continuously, the club also rotates other temporary shows through its repertoire. These have included the 2007 Rub a Dub Dub, a show in which players dub their own lines over health films and silent movies. The Lost Comedies of William Shakespeare, directed by David Charles in 2006, was a parody of Shakespeare's work, in which the performers synthesized a five-act play from audience suggestions.Topic Galleries - OrlandoSentinel.com The show received positive reviewsOrlando Sentinel review from the Orlando Sentinel. The players created a Broadway-style musical in Fourplay: The Improvised Musical, which ran during the summer of 2006. Also in 2006, were You Bet Your Asterisk, an improv game show, and SAK Request Live. Seasonal shows at SAK include variations on Duel of Fools, such as Love for Fools (Valentines Day), Yule of Fools (Christmas), Midnight Halloween Torture Show, and Mardi Gras SAK Style. Other continuous programs include Lab Rats, a show for invited graduates of SAK's improv training school, and Generation S (Gen S), a showcase of the best of Lab Rats and special invitees who are being trained to join the ensemble.  Company History  SAK Theatre enjoyed its humble beginnings in Buffalo, Minnesota when a troupe of four individuals with a background in evangelical street theater began performing at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival in 1977. After a few years, opportunities arose for SAK to perform at multiple festivals simultaneously. The original troupe trained additional performers and SAK grew from four members to twelve. In 1982, while performing at a festival in Largo, Florida, entertainment scouts from the Walt Disney Company came looking for entertainment acts to populate the World Showcase at the newly opening Epcot Center. SAK Theatre Company was now an official corporation and moved its base of operations to Florida. For seven years SAK produced, performed, and managed live audience participatory comedy shows for Walt Disney World in the United Kingdom Pavilion at Epcot and Italy Pavilion at Epcot, as well as countless other shows performed in and around the parks. SAK also continued to appear at festivals, expos, and fairs around the world well into the 1990s, and was employing over 30 full-time performers, production, and office staff. In 1991 after the Disney contract ended, SAK Theatre Company opened the SAK Comedy Lab on Church Street in downtown Orlando. This first venue was a 99-seat comedy theater dedicated to performing original comedy plays (many developed through improvisation) and improv shows. It was at this time when the SAK signature improv comedy competition, the ‚ÄúDuel of Fools,\\" was born. Every Friday and Saturday night for the past 23 years, two teams of improvisers have battled against each other to see who could make up the funniest scenes, sketches, and songs based on audience suggestions. Since its inception in 1991, the ‚ÄúLab‚Äù has grown to become one of the largest theaters and training centers for improvisation in the Southeast. It currently serves over 30,000 patrons a year as well as major Central Florida organizations such as the Orlando Magic, Florida Hospital and Darden Restaurants with its team training and corporate comedy shows. SAK is currently experiencing unprecedented breakaway growth and looks forward to entertaining Orlando audiences for another two decades and beyond.

It is located at 100 Madison Street. On May 21, 1969, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is located in the Missouri State Capitol Historic District. The current site on a bluff overlooking the Missouri River was the vicinity of the first Jefferson City Missouri State Capitol building from 1825 to 1837 after the capitol was relocated from St. Charles, Missouri to Jefferson City. The capitol burned in 1837 and was rebuilt at its current site a block to the west. The current Neo- Renaissance structure was built in 1871 at a cost of $75,000 and has served every governor since. It was renovated extensively during the administration of Governor Kit Bond in the 1980s. History=First mansion Prior to the relocation of the state capital to Jefferson City, the first governors who were from the St. Louis, Missouri/St. Charles, Missouri area lived in their private homes and if the need arose they rented homes in St. Charles. The first Jefferson City governor's mansion also doubled as the home for the Missouri General Assembly, with the Missouri House of Representatives meeting on the ground floor, the Missouri State Senate on the second floor and the governor living in two rooms. The structure, which was 60 by , was completed in November 1826 at a cost of $20,000. The building was designed by Stephen Hills and was modeled on the first Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Hill later designed Academic Hall at the University of Missouri (of which now remains only the landmark columns on the Francis Quadrangle. Second mansion Missouri's second governor Daniel Dunklin, after being elected in 1832, refused to move his family to the building. Construction of a new $5,000 mansion began in the autumn of 1833 and was completed in 1834. It was at the end of the same block as the original mansion/capitol. It had dimensions of 48 by and a portico with four. The building survived the November 15, 1837 fire that destroyed the neighboring capitol when wet blankets were applied to the roof of the mansion. The mansion suffered a fire in the 1840s during the administration of Thomas Reynolds. Reynolds killed himself in the mansion in 1844. A sofa with pineapple-shaped legs belonging to Reynolds is now one of the oldest pieces of furniture in the current mansion. Governor Robert Marcellus Stewart initiated a campaign to build a new residence. Stewart rode a horse up the steps into the house and ordered a servant to feed it a peck of oats. Stewart also pardoned all the women in the state prison and had them work in the mansion. The General Assembly allocated $20,000 for a new mansion but, the American Civil War interrupted the plan. Current mansion After B. Gratz Brown assumed office in 1871, several people said they would not come to large gatherings at the mansion because they feared disaster. In March 1871, the Assembly allocated $50,000 for a new mansion. George Ingham Barnett (whose work includes most of the buildings at the Missouri Botanical Garden built for Henry Shaw) was the architect. Major exterior features of the square, three-story red brick building are the mansard roof and four pink granite columns from Brown's quarry in Iron County, Missouri. The most striking interior feature is the Grand Stairway carved of walnut. The first of the major renovations occurred in the 1890s under Governor David Rowland Francis; they included painting the bricks deep red to cover soot stains. The next major renovation occurred under Lloyd C. Stark in which $55,000 was allocated to replace the columns supporting the Grand Stairway with steel brackets. The exterior was painted white and the Starks donated 3,000 plants from their nursery. During Kit Bond‚Äôs administration in the 1980s, the mansion was renovated extensively in an attempt to restore it to an 1871 appearance including the addition of Renaissance Revival style of furniture and restoration of the pink brick exterior. Tours Free guided tours are provided by volunteer docents. The Missouri Governor's Mansion tours are open April through mid-May. Reservations can be made through the Missouri State Parks website.

Written by Bryan Cooper and directed by Ken Turner, it was first broadcast on 16 February 1968 on ATV Midlands. In this episode, in an attempt the immobilise the whole of Spectrum, the Mysterons target the oil refinery that supplies the fuel for the organisation's vehicles. Plot In the oil fields of the Middle East desert, the Mysterons (voiced by Donald Gray) sabotage the drill on Rig 15 by opening a safety valve, releasing a jet of oil that quickly ignites and turns the rig into an inferno. An oil refinery at Bensheba is the one source of fuel for the Spectrum Organisation's vehicles. When the Mysterons cryptically threaten to \\"immobilise\\" the whole of Spectrum, Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray) fears that they intend to destroy the organisation's fuel supply and dispatches Captains Scarlet and Blue (voiced by Francis Matthews and Ed Bishop) to investigate the unfolding disaster at Rig 15. On arrival, Scarlet and Blue learn from the rig controller, Kinley, and his assistant, Hansen, that an explosives expert, Jason Smith, has been brought in to \\"blow out\\" the fire by detonating an explosive charge at its centre. However, they are unaware that Captain Black (voiced by Donald Gray) is observing the blaze from afar. While Smith is planting the charge, Black uses the Mysterons' powers to hypnotise him. The charge detonates according to plan and the fire is extinguished, but Smith is killed in the explosion and replaced with a double under Mysteron control. That night, Black orders Smith's double to leave in his truck and use his explosives to destroy the Bensheba refinery. The following morning, the body of the original Smith is discovered and Scarlet realises that the expert has been taken over by the Mysterons. He requisitions a Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle and chases Smith down the highway leading to Bensheba, managing to force him off the road before they reach the refinery. Smith's truck crashes into a dune and explodes, but at the same time Scarlet's SPV collides with a set of oil tanks, fatally injuring Scarlet. Scarlet's body is returned to Cloudbase in anticipation of his recovery. Production Before writing \\"Fire at Rig 15\\", Bryan Cooper had worked as a journalist and co-authored a book about North Sea oil. He later became a radio writer and a military historian. The premise of the episode was inspired by the \\"Devil's Cigarette Lighter\\", a gas well fire that burned for six months between 1961 and 1962 until it was finally extinguished by detonating a nitroglycerin charge at its epicentre to dispel the surrounding oxygen. The character of Jason Smith was based on Red Adair, the Texan oil well firefighter who put out the blaze, and Smith's tractor on the modified bulldozer that Adair used to deliver the charge. The Rig 15 personnel are named after colleagues of Adair: Kinley after Myron M. Kinley and Charlie Hansen after Charlie Tolar and Asger \\"Boots\\" Hansen (co-founder of the well control company Boots & Coots). In the original script, the Spectrum oil refinery is located at \\"Bethsheba\\". The episode was filmed in May 1967. Smith's tractor was designed by special effects assistant Mike Trim. The scale model of the Bensheba refinery re-used parts of the model refinery seen in the Thunderbirds episode \\"Ricochet\\". The incidental music was recorded on 22 July 1967 during a four-hour studio session using an ensemble of 15 instrumentalists. Music for \\"Shadow of Fear\\" was recorded during the same session. The music for \\"Fire at Rig 15\\", titled \\"Rig 15\\", is included on the CD release of the Captain Scarlet soundtrack. \\"Fire at Rig 15\\" was the last episode of Captain Scarlet to be produced with the original instrumental version of the series' ending theme music prior to the introduction of the lyrical version sung by The Spectrum. Reception According to Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping, authors of The Guinness Book of Classic British TV, \\"Fire At Rig 15\\" is one of several Captain Scarlet episodes that \\"seem little more than left-over Thunderbirds scripts.\\" Anthony Clark of sci-fi- online.com comments negatively on the episode, calling it the \\"typical, and rather dull, 'Mysterons destroy something and Spectrums runs about' story\\". He argues that the setting \\"could just as easily be a submarine base or high- security installation, which makes it hard to care about what's going on.\\" ReferencesExternal links \\"Fire at Rig 15\\" at TheVervoid.com 1968 British television episodes Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons episodes Middle East in fiction ","title":"Fire at Rig 15"},{"id":"9633516","text":"The South Carolina Governor's Mansion (or the South Carolina Executive Mansion) is a historic U.S. governor's mansion in the Arsenal Hill neighborhood of Columbia, South Carolina and the official residence of the Governor of South Carolina. It is a Federal style home influenced by British Colonial plantations. The building has a white stucco exterior and originally served as faculty quarters for the Arsenal Academy, which together with the Citadel Academy in Charleston formed the South Carolina Military Academy (now The Citadel). The Arsenal was burned along with the city of Columbia by Sherman's forces in February, 1865; the structure was the only surviving building and became South Carolina's executive mansion in 1868.\\"History of the South Carolina Military Academy\\", Col J.P. Thomas On June 5, 1970, the building was registered with the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The mansion is located on a single city block, and is surrounded by magnolia plants, elm and oak trees, and various other plants. It is accessed by a circular driveway around a fountain in front on the residence's main entrance. Scott Bolser oversees maintenance of the historic grounds at the mansion. The building has a flat roof and a large central pavilion around the main entrance. The mansion has 15 rooms (excluding powder rooms, security and staff offices, and the kitchen). It is located in Columbia Historic District I. The mansion is currently occupied by Governor Henry McMaster and his family. History=1800s It is unknown who the building's original architect was, but George Edward Walker, who designed other buildings in the area is believed to have constructed the mansion. The mansion originally served as housing for officers as part of the state-supported Arsenal Military Academy; Columbia was burned by the Union Army commanded by William Tecumseh Sherman in 1865. The mansion was the only surviving building of the former academy complex. Governor James L. Orr designated the building as the official state governor's mansion in 1868. In 1869, $2,500 was used by local architect A. Y. Lee to make the property suitable as an executive residence. However, the money was depleted before the renovation was completed and Governor Robert K. Scott had to relocate into an unfinished house. Since 1868, only three governors of the state have not lived in the mansion, staying instead in their own private residences within Columbia. The first to do so, Daniel Henry Chamberlain, lived in a nearby mansion, most likely because the governor's mansion was in disrepair. The state leased the official residence to a private family who used it as a boardinghouse. Later, in 1886, Governor John Peter Richardson III donated $2,700 to make significant modifications to the building. 1900s The building had demonstrated severe structural defects by the end of the 1940s, but only in 1955 did repairs begin, causing George Timmerman and his family to abandon the mansion for one year. The residence received significant landscaping improvements, a driveway, and a walled courtyard during the term of Donald S. Russell, as well as work to improve the building's structural integrity and a complete interior renovation, part of which was funded by the Russells' personal funds. Russell was actually forced to live in one half of the house due to incorrectly installed beams in the ceiling of the drawing room. A single-story guest wing and family dining area was added to the building during the term of Ernest F. Hollings. Governor Robert E. McNair formed a Governor's Mansion Committee, managed by his wife, Josephine McNair. The committee was able to obtain numerous items related to South Carolina's culture and history for the furnishing of the mansion. The commission purchased the adjacent Lace House for $67,000 in 1968, creating the Governor's Mansion Complex. In 1970, the South Carolina state legislature gave the commission the power to review improvements to the complex. In 1977, Ann Edwards, the governor's wife, initiated the Governor's Mansion Foundation, a not-for-profit organization to raise funds to pay for the mansion's historic furnishings. At the same time, the neighboring Caldwell-Boylston House was purchased, which, along with the Lace House, now provides office area, a gift shop, meeting space, and entertainment space. In 1986, all three buildings were connected by a landscaping project, making a complex. In 1988, more structural defects were exposed from previous repairs, but plans to renovate yet again were not made quickly. During the term of Carroll A. Campbell, the only significant additions to the complex were that of a new guardhouse and second fountain. The renovation project began while David M. Beasley was governor, but was not completed until 2001, with a total cost of over $6 million, which exceeded the $3.7 million allocated by the state. Governor James H. Hodges became the first governor in 120 years not to live in the mansion in 1999. 2000s In 2003, Governor Mark Sanford announced that, as a result of a $150,000 budget deficit, the mansion would have to be closed for several months. Sanford said that the state could not afford to pay for the mansion's employees, utilities, and food. He also accused the previous governor, Jim Hodges, of overspending and ending the employment of prison inmates as butlers and maids (after allegations of sexual misconduct between inmates while working at the mansion in 2001), causing the state to have to pay for 11 employees. He also criticized the former governor for misappropriating $100,000 in other funding for the mansion two days before leaving office. However, Hodges said that the money assigned for the mansion had never been enough and that it was usual to use other funds to help maintain the residence. Sanford supporter John Rainey established a relief fund to help the building stay operational. A local company, Adluh Flour, donated grits and other wheat and corn products to the governor. In 2008, improvements to make the building more energy-efficient were completed.

Plot summary Jack Reacher gets off a Greyhound bus in the town of Margrave, Georgia, because he remembers his brother mentioning that a blues musician named Blind Blake had died there. Much to his surprise, shortly after his arrival, he is arrested in a local diner for murder on the orders of the sheriff, Morrison, who falsely claims he saw Reacher leave the scene. While in custody, Reacher meets Finlay, the chief of detectives, and Roscoe, a female officer who believes him to be innocent. Reacher persuades Finlay to call a number on a piece of paper found in the dead man's shoe; the number leads them to Paul Hubble, a retired banker who instantly confesses to the murder. Before Reacher can be released, he and Hubble are transferred to a state prison in Warburton, where Reacher manages to thwart an attempt on their lives by the Aryan Brotherhood. Suspecting that the deputy warden set them up, Reacher joins Finlay's investigation, while Hubble is presumed dead after vanishing from his house in the middle of the day. Reacher learns that the murdered man is his brother, Joe, who was running an investigation into a counterfeiting ring operated by the Kliner family under the protection of Morrison, several dirty cops, and the corrupt mayor, Grover Teale. A second body, belonging to truck driver Sherman Stoller, is found, and Morrison and his wife are brutally murdered shortly thereafter. Roscoe theorizes that the Kliners are using Margrave as a distribution hub for their counterfeit money, but this is eventually disproven when Reacher searches one of their trucks and finds it empty. He then realizes that the opposite is true: the Kliners have been hoarding the money in response to a Coast Guard operation cutting off their supply of bills from Venezuela, and plan to resume distribution once the operation is shut down as a cost-saving measure. Sending Hubble's family into hiding to protect them from Kliner, Reacher kills his son and several other associates after luring them into an ambush. He then informs Finlay of the secret behind Kliner's operation, which his brother had been trying to prove: to obtain the special paper required to make undetectable forgeries, the criminals had employed Hubble to collect hundreds of thousands of used $1 bills and send them to ports in Florida through Stoller and other drivers, whereupon they would be bleached in Venezuela to remove the ink and then used to make forged $100 bills. However, when they return to Margrave, they are taken captive by Kliner, Teale, and Finlay's FBI contact Picard, who reveals that he's been keeping track of their progress, and has Roscoe and Hubble's family in his custody. Kliner reveals that Hubble isn't dead, but in hiding, and threatens to kill his hostages unless Reacher finds him. En route, Reacher stages a distraction and kills Picard's escorts, before apparently shooting him dead. He then locates Hubble in a nearby motel, and brings him back to Margrave. Finding the criminals gone, they spring Finlay from captivity in the police station and set it on fire, before locating the hostages at Kliner's warehouse. Reacher kills a dirty cop named Baker, shoots Teale and Kliner, and sets fire to the rest of their money. A wounded Picard shows up and beats Reacher down, but Finlay distracts him long enough for Reacher to kill him. The group then escapes as the warehouse explodes, and Reacher ends up spending the night with Roscoe. Realizing that his actions will attract a lot of unwanted attention from the authorities, Reacher decides to leave Georgia. Roscoe gives him one last gift: a picture of his brother retrieved from one of Kliner's victims.

It describes all of the stages between having a concept, and translating that concept into linguistic form. In computational linguistics/natural language processing and artificial intelligence, the term natural language generation (NLG) is more common, and those models may or may not be psychologically motivated.  Stages of production  Language production consists of several interdependent processes which transform a nonlinguistic message into a spoken, signed, or written linguistic signal. Though the following steps proceed in this approximate order, there is plenty of interaction and communication between them. The process of message planning is an active area of psycholinguistic research, but researchers have found that it is an ongoing process throughout language production. Research suggests that messages are planned in roughly the same order that they are in an utterance. But, there is also evidence that suggests the verbs that give case may be planned earlier than objects, even when the object is said first. After identifying a message, or part of a message, to be linguistically encoded, a speaker must select the individual words‚Äîalso known as lexical items‚Äîto represent that message. This process is called lexical selection. The words are selected based on their meaning, which in linguistics is called semantic information. Lexical selection activates the word's lemma, which contains both semantic and grammatical information about the word. This grammatical information is then used in the next step of language production, grammatical encoding. Critical grammatical information includes characteristics such as the word's syntactic category (noun, verb, etc.), what objects it takes, and grammatical gender if it is present in the language. Using some of these characteristics as well as information about the thematic roles of each word in the intended message, each word is then assigned the grammatical and thematic role it will have in the sentence. Function morphemes, like the plural /s/ or the past tense /…™d/, are added in this stage as well. After an utterance, or part of one, has been formed, it then goes through phonological encoding. In this stage of language production, the mental representation of the words to be spoken is transformed into a sequence of speech sounds to be pronounced. The speech sounds are assembled in the order they are to be produced. The basic loop occurring in the creation of language consists of the following stages: * Intended message * Encode message into linguistic form * Encode linguistic form into speech motor system * Sound goes from speaker's mouth to hearer's ear auditory system * Speech is decoded into linguistic form * Linguistic form is decoded into meaning According to the lexical access model (see section below), in terms of lexical access, two different stages of cognition are employed; thus, this concept is known as the two-stage theory of lexical access. The first stage, lexical selection provides information about lexical items required to construct the functional level representation. These items are retrieved according to their specific semantic and syntactic properties, but phonological forms are not yet made available at this stage. The second stage, retrieval of wordforms, provides information required for building the positional level representation.  Models of production = Serial model  A serial model of language production divides the process into several stages. For example, there may be one stage for determining pronunciation and a stage for determining lexical content. The serial model does not allow overlap of these stages, so they may only be completed one at a time.  Connectionist model  Several researchers have proposed a connectionist model, one notable example being Dell . According to his connectionist model, there are four layers of processing and understanding: semantic, syntactic, morphological, and phonological. These work in parallel and in series, with activation at each level. Interference and misactivation can occur at any of these stages. Production begins with concepts, and continues down from there. One might start with the concept of a cat: a four-legged, furry, domesticated mammal with whiskers, etc. This conceptual set would attempt to find the corresponding word {cat}. This selected word would then select morphological and phonological data /k / at/. The distinction of this model is that, during this process, other elements would also be primed ({rat} might be somewhat primed, for example), as they are physically similar, and so can cause conceptual interference. Errors might also occur at the phoneme level, as many words are phonetically similar, e.g. mat. Substitutions of similar consonant sounds are more likely to occur, e.g. between plosive stop consonants such as d, p and b. Lower primed words are less likely to be chosen, but interference is thought to occur in cases of early selection, where the level of activation of the target and interference words is at the same level.  Lexical access model  This model states that the sentence is made by a sequence of processes generating differing levels of representations. For instance, the functional level representation is made on the a preverbal representation, which is essentially what the speaker seeks to express. This level is responsible for encoding the meanings of lexical items and the way that grammar forms relationships between them. Next, the positional level representation is built, which functions to encode the phonological forms of words and the order they are found in sentence structures. Lexical access, according to this model, is a process that encompasses two serially ordered and independent stages.  Additional aspects of production = Fluency  Fluency can be defined in part by prosody, which is shown graphically by a smooth intonation contour, and by a number of other elements: control of speech rate, relative timing of stressed and unstressed syllables, changes in amplitude, and changes in fundamental frequency.  Multilingualism  Whether or not a speaker is fluent in only one language, the process for producing language remains the same. However, bilinguals speaking two languages within a conversation access both languages at the same time. The three most commonly discussed models for multilingual language access are the Bilingual Interactive Activation model, the Revised Hierarchical Model, and the Language Mode model: * Bilingual Interactive Activation Plus, updated from a model made by Dijkstra and Van Heuven, uses solely bottom-up processing to facilitate bilingual language access. * Revised Hierarchical Model, developed by Kroll and Stewart, is a model suggesting that bilingual brains store meanings in a common place, word-forms are separated by language. * Language Mode Model, made by Grosjean, uses two assumptions to map bilingual language production in a modular way. These assumptions are that a base language is activated in conversation, and that the speaker's other language is activated to relative degrees depending on context. De Bot describes it as overly simple for the complexity of the process, but suggests it has room for expansion. Speakers fluent in multiple languages can inhibit access to one of their languages, but this suppression can only be done once the speaker is at a certain level of proficiency in that language. A speaker can decide to inhibit a language based on non-linguistic cues in their conversation, such as a speaker of both English and French conversing with people who only speak English. When especially proficient multilingual speakers communicate, they can participate in code-switching. Code-switching has been shown to indicate bilingual proficiency in a speaker, though it had previously been seen as a sign of poor language ability.  Research into production  There are two main types of research into speech production. One type focuses on using the analysis of speech errors. The other looks at reaction-time data from picture- naming latencies. Although originally disparate, these two methodologies are generally looking at the same underlying processes of speech production.  Speech errors  Analysis of speech errors has found that not all are random, but rather systematic and fall into several categories. Although speech production is very fast, (2 words per second) the error rate of the utterances are relatively rare (less than 1/1000) and those errors are categorized as follows: *Anticipation: The word is in the speaker's mind and ready to be spoken, but the speaker says it too quickly. This could be because the speaker is planning and holding words in their mind. *Perseveration: The word retains characteristics of a word said previously in a sentence: ::Taddle Tennis instead of Paddle Tennis *Blending: More than one word is being considered and the two intended items \\"blend\\" into a single item, perhaps implying the speaker is waffling between a few word options. ::The child is looking to be spaddled instead of spanked or paddled *Addition: adding of linguistics material, resulting in words like implossible. *Substitution: a whole word of related meaning is replacing another. These errors can be far apart from another, or target words, and are generally grammatically consistent and accurate. ::at low speed it's too light (instead of heavy) *Malapropism: a lay term referring to the incorrect substitution of words. It is a reference to a character Mrs Malaprop from Sheridan's The Rivals. ::Makes no delusions to the past. ::The pineapple of perfection. ::I have interceded another letter from the fellow. *Spoonerism: switching the letters from words. For example, the phrase slips of the tongue could become tips of the slung.

The artist led an itinerant life and worked in Rome, Brussels, Amsterdam, Persia and India (Goa). While in Rome Sweerts became linked to the group of Dutch and Flemish painters of low-life scenes known as the Bamboccianti. Sweerts' contributions to the Bamboccianti genre display generally greater stylistic mastery and social-philosophical sensitivity than the other artists working in this manner. While he was successful during his lifetime, Sweerts and his work fell into oblivion until he was rediscovered in the 20th century as one of the most intriguing and enigmatic artists of his time.Michiel Sweerts (Brussels 1618-1664 Goa), A lady sewing in an interior at Christie's Life=Early life and stay in Rome Michiel Sweerts was born in Brussels where he was baptized on 29 September 1618 in the St. Nicholas Church as the son of David Sweerts, a linen merchant, and Martina Ballu.

They created small cabinet paintings or etchings of the everyday life of the lower classes in Rome and its countryside. In Rome, Sweerts painted genre paintings in the style of the Bamboccianti as well as a series of canvases on the activities and training of painters in their studios, attending classes or working from live models.Life of Michiel Sweerts (Brussels, 1624 -Goa, 1664) at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum He resided near Santa Maria del Popolo. In 1647, Sweerts became an associate (aggregato) of the Accademia di San Luca, a prestigious association of leading artists in Rome. Sweerts is also recorded as having connections with members of the Congregazione Artistica dei Virtuosi al Pantheon. The Congregazione was a corporation of artists who organised annual exhibitions of their own paintings on the metal railings in front of the Pantheon.Edgar Peters Bowron, Joseph J. Rishel, Art in Rome in the Eighteenth Century, Philadelphia Museum of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, 2000, pp. 236‚Äì237 There is no evidence that Sweerts became himself a member of the Virtuosi. Sweerts lived from 1646 to 1651 in the Via Margutta where many foreign artists resided. While in Rome, Sweerts was the teacher of Willem Reuter, another Flemish painter from Brussels who spent time in Rome where he was influenced by the Bamboccianti.Biographical details at the National Gallery of Art, accessed 15 March 2016 Double portrait Despite the fragmentary nature of evidence pertaining to his career in Rome, Sweerts evidently succeeded in creating for himself a sufficiently solid reputation to be invited to enter into the service of the ruling papal family, the Pamphili family, and in particular Prince Camillo Pamphilj, the nephew of the reigning Pope Innocent X. He is said to have painted a portrait of Camillo Pamphilj.Everett Fahy, Jayne Wrightsman, 'The Wrightsman Pictures', Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2005, p. 128 Sweerts also painted theatre decors for Camillo Pamphilj and purchased art for him as his agent.Maaike Dirkx, The silent world of Michael Sweerts (2), posted on 19 August 2013 It is likely that his patron Prince Camillo Pamphilj involved Sweerts in the organization of an art academy in Rome.Adriano Aymonino, Anne Varick Lauder, Drawn from the Antique: Artists and the Classical Ideal, Sir John Soane‚Äôs Museum 2015, pp. 134‚Äì139 At the instigation of Camillo, the pope bestowed upon Sweerts the papal title of Cavaliere di Cristo (Knight of Christ), the same honor enjoyed by the likes of Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Francesco Borromini.Jonathan Bikker, \\"Sweerts' Life and Career: A Documentary View,\\" in 'Guido Jansen, et al., ed., Michael Sweerts: 1618‚Äì1664, Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum, 2002, 28-31. It is during his time in Rome that Sweerts developed a lifelong relationship with the Deutz family, who were one of the most prominent trading families of Amsterdam. In 1651 Jean Deutz gave Sweerts a power of attorney to act on his behalf in a sale of silk. The Deutz brothers also purchased paintings of Sweerts through the art market in Italy. Sweerts further acted for the Deutzes as an agent on the Italian art market. It is believed that the Portrait of Man with a Red Cloak (c. 1650, Wallace Collection) is in fact a portrait of Jean Deutz who was likely then in Rome on his grand tour.Jonathan Bikker, The Deutz Brothers, Italian Paintings and Michiel Sweerts: New Information from Elisabeth Coymans's \\"Journael\\", in: Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art Vol. 26, No. 4 (1998), pp. 277-311 Return to Brussels and residence in Amsterdam Despite enjoying the patronage of the highest echelons in Rome, Sweerts left Rome for unknown reasons sometime between 1652 and 1654. He is recorded in Brussels in July 1655 at the baptism of a child of his sister. In Brussels he joined the local Guild of Saint Luke in 1659. He opened an academy in Brussels where his students could work after live models and the Antique. He also created a series of prints of various human expressions, which were used in the training of his students. Bathing men Sweerts joined around this time the Missions √âtrang√®res, a Catholic missionary organization, who were followers of Vincent de Paul and committed to proselytizing in the East. He was a lay brother and became a devout Christian. A Lazarus priest who met Sweerts in 1661 reported that Sweerts had apparently experienced a 'miraculous conversion' and had stopped eating meat, fasted daily, had given away his possessions and took communion three or four times a week. In 1658 Sweerts made for the Guild of Saint Luke of Brussels a self-portrait as a farewell gift. He perhaps spent time in Amsterdam, probably as early as 1658. It is documented that he was present in Amsterdam for a number of months in the year 1661 just prior to setting off on his trip with the Missions √âtrang√®res to the Far East. During his time in Amsterdam he helped supervise the building of the ship that would transport the Missions √âtrang√®res to Alexandretta and then further East.De geschilderde geheimen van Michael Sweerts in: Rijksmuseum Kunstkrant maart/april 2002 Travel to the East By December 1661 Sweerts had arrived in Marseilles from where his ship left for Palestine in January 1662.Michael Sweerts at the Kremer Collection Sweerts sailed for Alexandretta with bishop Fran√ßois Pallu, 7 priests and another lay brother. In Syria he is said to have produced some paintings. On the overland portion of the trip in Syria he became mentally unstable and was dismissed from the company somewhere between Isfahan and Tabriz in Persia. He then travelled on to the Portuguese Jesuits in Goa where he is reported to have died at the age of 46. Work=General Portrait of a young woman The surviving works by Sweerts mostly date to the period of his residence in Rome. Due to the difficulty of attributing works to the artist who rarely signed his works, the number of canvases given to the artist vary from 40 to 100. Some of Sweerts' works were so popular in his time that contemporary copies were made, some by Sweerts himself, others by pupils or followers. It is not always easy to determine the level of Sweerts' involvement (if any) in the making of these copies. For instance, there exist at least four early copies, of varying quality, of his Artist‚Äôs studio with a woman sewing (one copy at the Collection RAU - Fondation Unicef, Cologne).Maaike Dirkx, Michael Sweerts on the art market, posted on 19 August 2013 None of his paintings produced after he left Europe is known to survive. The majority of his output falls into two categories: 'genre scenes\\" of low-life subjects of country and street life and portraits or tronies. A third category are allegorical works, which are regarded as enigmatic and are the subject of ongoing interpretation by art historians.Thomas R√∂ske, \\"Blicke auf M√§nnerk√∂rper bei Michael Sweerts (1618-1664)\\", in: 'M√§nnlichkeit im Blick, Visuelle Inszenierungen in der Kunst seit der Fr√ºhen Neuzeit' Published by Mechthild Fend und Marianne Koos, Cologne, Weimar, Vienna, 2004, pp. 121‚Äì135 Sweerts reportedly painted compositions of Biblical subjects, several of which are mentioned in contemporary inventories. However, none of these are known to have survived. One of his religious paintings, a Lamentation is known from the print, which Sweerts himself made after his own painting. The composition is unusual for the Virgin‚Äôs comforting gesture towards the inconsolable Mary Magdalene. Sweerts is an enigmatic and difficult artist to categorise, since he absorbed a variety of influences to create an eclectic style that adapted Netherlandish genre painting to early tenebrist styles as well as blended Baroque and classicist tendencies. Genre scenes A large portion of the output of Sweerts consists of genre scenes. Some of these reprise the subjects popular with the followers of Caravaggio such as card and dice players and the procuress. Examples are the Draughts players and the Card players (both in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). The latter composition depicts a group of people whose card game is interrupted by a brawl. Their eyes send the gaze of the viewer to the right, in the direction of the pointing arm of the man in the front. This painting possibly symbolizes laziness. A cunning boy takes advantage of the chaos to rob the man in blue.De kaartspelers, Michael Sweerts, ca. 1646 - ca. 1652 at the Rijksmuseum To give drink to the thirsty Other genre paintings by of Sweerts depict low-life scenes mainly placed in the Roman Campagna or on Rome's streets in a style close to that of the Bamboccianti. An example is A man delousing himself and a sleeping boy (c. 1650 - 1654, Mauritshuis). Sweerts' compositions differ, however, from those of the other Bambocciante painters by his preference for antique sculpture and the noble appearance of his often monumental figures. Sweerts often used chiaroscuro to create a dramatic and mysterious atmosphere. His personal style is clearly manifested in his Seven Acts of Mercy series ()(ca. 1646-9), a series of 7 canvases which he painted in Rome as genre-style renderings of a religious theme. The canvases are now dispersed over various museums. The subject of the Seven Acts of Mercy is based on the Gospel of Matthew, 25: 31-46. These verses announce the Last Judgment, the event during which Christ is said to judge man by his works. Sweerts depicted the good works in a contemporary Roman environment and incorporated topographical elements from the neighborhood in which he lived at the time. Sweerts shows in these scenes his preference for dark night skies and backgrounds, which dramatically light up the figures.Marleen Dominicus-van Soest, De geschilderde geheimen van Michael Sweerts , 31 May 2008 at artwis.com These compositions represent the scenes in a frozen movement in a dreamlike setting almost like a film still. In this workds Sweerts expresses his compassion and empathy with the suffering of his subjects and his support for the charitable acts performed for them. Wrestling match Sweerts developed new themes such as that of the Roman wrestlers. In his Wrestling match (1649, Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe) Sweerts depicted the popular wrestling matches that took place in Rome's streets and were attended by a large audience. The representation is real, but at the same time somehow unreal. This is not only because of the dramatic lighting, but also by the fact that the movements of the men appear frozen. Sweerts relied for the main characters on classic images. Through the large scale of the nudes in this composition Sweerts lifted the 'vulgar' subject to a higher level. Sweerts painted more compositions depicting male nudes such as the Bathing men (Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg). It has been demonstrated that Sweerts moved in a milieu in Rome from which women were generally excluded. The question remains whether some of his paintings of male nudes should be interpreted as denoting a message relating to homosexuality. Artist studios Sweerts' genre scenes include several compositions depicting artists training or at work in their studios or outdoors. They provide valuable visual evidence on the work habits and training of 17th- century artists. Sweerts also depicted a number of drawing schools. He was himself actively involved in art education at academies in Rome and Brussels. Artist studio His Painter's studio (1648-1650, Rijksmuseum) shows various draughtsmen in an artist studio drawing after various plaster models and probably one live nude. There are also two visitors in the studio. The picture seems to depict the main principles and stages of studio practice, starting from drawing after casts and anatomical figures in plaster and then from the live model. The prominence given to the plaster models in the right front of the composition show the importance in the artistic training and practice of contemporary artists of the study of casts of not only Antique but also modern sculptures. In another composition on the theme of the Artist studio (1652, Detroit Institute of Arts), a visitor to an artist studio is examining a cast of a limbless Apollo, which is based on a model by the 17th century Flemish sculptor Fran√ßois Duquesnoy, who worked in Rome. Other objects present in the composition include surveying instruments, a lute and sheet music. These objects are a reference to the need for artists to strive for harmony as well as respect accurate size and proportion. The glimpse of the library in the composition highlights that painters are not craftsmen, but learned artists. Portraits and tronies Head of a woman In his portraits Sweerts proved himself on a par with the leading contemporaries in the field. Sweerts is believed to have painted his tronies in Brussels or Amsterdam, i.e. between 1655 and 1661. He showed an interest in depicting ordinary people and exploring character and different expressions. In his Clothing the naked Sweerts portrayed very non-classical (i.e. Netherlandish-looking) figures whose features are emphasized by sideway glances and curious expressions. The beautiful daylight and velvety backgrounds can also be found in works by Johannes Vermeer. Sweerts' tronies of young women with their use of antique props also anticipate Vermeer.Walter A. Liedtke, Michiel Plomp, Axel R√ºger, Vermeer and the Delft School, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), National Gallery (Great Britain), Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001, p. 393 This work and another work such as the Anthonij de Bordes and his valet (National Gallery of Art) are examples of portraits that take the form of genre paintings.Guido M.C. Jansen, A Family Tradition Confirmed: Sweerts‚Äôs Portrait of Anthonij de Bordes , 13 May 2010 Man holding a jug His subject matter is close to that of Dutch genre painters such as Pieter de Hooch and Vermeer. His Head of a Woman (ca. 1654, J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles) is a noteworthy example of his ability to capture the lively and distinctive humanity of even his most humble, anonymous subjects.Malcolm Waddingham, Additions to the Oeuvre of Michael Sweerts, The J. Paul Getty Museum Journal: Volume 8, 1980, The J. Paul Getty Museum, Getty Publications, 1 Jan 1980, pp. 63‚Äì68 His Portrait of a young woman (c. 1660, Kremer Collection), which is likely a portrait of a simple maidservant, also shows Sweerts' interest in portraying common people. The painting has been compared to the Girl with a Pearl Earring painted by Vermeer some five years later. The young girls in both compositions are depicted with a combination of realism and idealisation. There are important differences between the two works. Vermeer's composition is more compact, his light reflections are more subtle and Vermeer uses yellow and blue tones in a more daring manner. Vermeer further shows the young girl wearing an exotic turban and a pearl earring that appears too big to be real. Sweerts prefers to show the girl as a simple maidservant without frills. Some of Sweerts' tronies can be traced back to the \\"low life\\" studies of characters in the Spanish Netherlands through Adriaen Brouwer and his followers to Pieter Bruegel the Elder in the 1560s. Sweerts succeeded in making these subjects look freshly observed. An example is the Man holding a jug (Metropolitan Museum of Art). In this depiction of a tavern habitu√© Sweerts succeeds in displaying his remarkable gifts for describing character as well as physical substances and light effects.Michiel Sweerts, Man Holding a Jug at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Sweerts painted a number of self-portraits and some of his portraits are regarded as being self-portraits.Dutch and Flemish paintings from the Hermitage, an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, pp. 114‚Äì115 The earliest known self-portrait of about 1648-50 (Uffizi) shows the artist wearing a beret with a plunging feather giving him a distinctly 'bohemian' air. Portrait of a young man His Self-portrait of 1656 (Allen Memorial Art Museum) shows the artist in a confident pose. This self- portrait stands in a long-established line of self-portraits by Netherlandish artists, showing themselves with the tools of their craft. His elegant, aristocratic appearance also brings to mind the artist portraits in Iconography of Anthony van Dyck, published in Antwerp between 1636 and 1641. The emphasis is on showing the artist as a virtuoso who possesses an aristocratic posture, learning and esteem. Sweerts made a mirror image reproduction of this self-portrait in an etching bearing the inscription Michael Sweerts Eq. Pi. et fe. In another self-portrait, probably painted about 1655, the artist points to a skull as a vanitas reminder.M. E. Wieseman, Michiel Sweerts, Self-Portrait at Allen Memorial Art Museum Another presumed self-portrait is the Portrait of a young man (1656, Hermitage), which shows a young man in a melancholy pose. It was previously believed that the sitter's mood was connected to his financial difficulties. The current view is that the painting is a pensieroso (pensive) portrait, a motive going back to the fifteenth-century Neoplatonic concept that melancholy is the distinguishing feature of the creative character. The allegorical significance of the objects in the painting such as old books, empty purse, gold coins, and inkwell is consistent with this interpretation. The portrait also has a moralizing inscription, RATIO QUIQUE REDDENDA (Every man must give an accounting). This allegorical strain is characteristic of Sweerts' art. Another painting that doubles as a self-portrait is the Penitent reading in a room (Marco Grassi Collection, New York), showing a man reading a sacred book amidst vanitas symbols such as a skull and an hourglass. The message of the painting may be that faith is available everywhere. This painting could foreshadow Sweerts' conversion to a more fanatical immersion in his faith that would finally compel him to travel to the East. Allegorical scenes Mars destroying the art A number of compositions deal with subjects, which appear to have an allegorical meaning. Many of these works still escape full understanding by contemporary scholarship. Some of his portraits carry an allegorical meaning and stand in the Netherlandish tradition of depicting the five senses. An example is the series of five portraits of boys and girls representing the five senses, which are now dispersed over various collections. Two of them of a boy and a girl respectively representing Smell and Feeling are in the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen.Michael Sweerts, Girl with a bandaged finger - feeling, 1656 - 1661 at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen Another allegorical composition is his Mars Destroying the Arts (Private collection) in which Sweerts portrayed a soldier plundering a violin, paintings and sculpture.Loma- Ann Marks, Art and Conflict ‚Äì M-Museum in Leuven Presents Ravaged in the London Magazine Sweerts' monumental Plague in an Ancient City (ca. 1652-54, Los Angeles County Museum of Art) is regarded as Sweerts' most ambitious work in terms not only of compositional complexity and technical achievement, but also of historical and archeological erudition. The composition depicts a haunting, dramatic vision of the ravages of the bubonic plague in a classical setting. It is clearly an attempt by the artist at proving his talent both in the depiction of a historical scene of epic proportions that encompasses a broad range of emotional and psychological states in imitation of the grand classicizing style of his older French contemporary and fellow-resident in Rome, Nicolas Poussin (1594‚Äì1665). Art historians have proposed various theories about what the composition depicts and its interpretation. Some see in it a generic depiction of the effects of the plague with no specific historical, moral or narrative meaning. Plague in an Ancient City The art scholar Franco Mormando has recently argued that the Plague in an Ancient City depicts a specific plague that according to Christian sources took place in Rome in 361‚Äì63 during the reign of emperor Julian. Emperor Julian had sought a return to Roman paganism against the Christian faith. The plague during Julian's reign was regarded in Sweerts' time as a punishment for Julian's anti-Christian policies. In the composition Sweerts was likely commenting on the contemporary struggle of the Catholic Church against Protestantism. The historical, religious, artistic and archeological allusions of the composition would not have been evident to ordinary lay viewers but only to small group of the cultural elite who delighted in such painted puzzles.Franco Mormando, \\"Pestilence, Apostasy, and Heresy in Seventeenth-Century Rome: Deciphering Michael Sweerts' Plague in an Ancient City in Piety and Plague: From Byzantium to the Baroque, eds. F. Mormando and T. Worcester, Kirksville, Truman State University Press, 2007, pp. 237-312. For a confirmation of Mormando's thesis, see Lara Yeager-Crasselt, Michael Sweerts (1618-1664): Shaping the Artist and the Academy in Rome and Brussels, Turnhout, Brepols, 2015, pp.84-87. Prints Portrait of Jan van den Enden Sweerts etched a small number of plates, 21 in total. These were issued in small editions making his prints exceptionally rare. He engraved a series of 13 plates with a Latin title, Diversae facies in usum iuvenum et aliorum ('Various faces for use by the young and others'), which served as drawing models for his academy students. For this reason a full set of the prints in the collection of the Fitzwilliam Museum were squared up in pencil to facilitate copying. The set was published in Brussels in 1656, the same year that Sweerts established a drawing academy in the city.Lord Fitzwilliam's album of prints by Michiel Sweerts (1624-1664) at the Fitzwilliam Museum Drawings Very few drawings have been attributed with certainty to Sweerts. A portrait in black chalk of Jan van den Enden (c. 1651, National Gallery of Art) is a very powerful portrait drawing of a young man. It is one of the first drawings attributed with any reasonable certainty to Sweerts.National Gallery of Art Acquires Important Works Across Media by Adams, Moran, Whistler, Vasari, Sweerts, Le Va, and More at the National Gallery References External links  * 1618 births 1664 deaths Flemish Baroque painters Flemish portrait painters Flemish genre painters Members of the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke Artists from Brussels ","title":"Michiel Sweerts"},{"id":"9633573","text":"Applicator Applicators may refer to: *The Applicators, an American pop punk band *A tool to put tubal ligation clips in place *Electron beam collimator component in some devices ","title":"Applicator"},{"id":"9633576","text":"In Greek mythology, Peisistratus or Pisistratus (Ancient Greek: Œ†ŒµŒπœÉŒØœÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒøœÇ Peisistratos) was a prince of Pylos in Messenia.

History Baptist Mills is so named from the mills that once stood there. A grist (flour) mill is recorded in this area in a document written in 1470, and again in 1610, when they are marked on Chester and Master's Map of Kingswood. The mills were converted to brass mills by the Bristol Brass Company, formed in 1702 by Abraham Darby, Edward lloyd, John Andrews, and Arthur Thomas. In 1706, further partners were admitted, the business becoming an early unincorporated joint stock company with a capital of ¬£8000. While there, Darby recruited skilled 'Dutchmen' to operate a brass battery with trip hammers. He may also have recruited men skilled in sand moulding as opposed to the loam moulding hitherto used in England. Darby was the active partner in the business, but later withdrew to concentrate on his new ironfounding business at Coalbrookdale.

After the trip, Goodman takes some samples back to his laboratory, in the United States, and discovers that they are still alive. He then invites Decker to show him his discoveries. Once Decker arrives, Goodman explains several of his theories about the cells, and has engineered a strain of \\"C Cells\\" which are incredibly resilient to damage and disease. Goodman is actively searching for ways these C Cells could be implemented to insert into one's body to cure disease, due to their strange properties and signs of immortality. Then the professor proposes to Decker the idea of cloning the cells, but Decker does not support this idea. Some years pass and Decker visits Professor Goodman with one of his two daughters. While Hawthorne and Goodman talk for some time, Decker's daughter meets and interacts with the Goodmans' adopted son, Christopher. On the way back home, Decker deduces Christopher's origin. He immediately returns to Goodman's home and confronts him about Christopher being the Clone of Jesus Christ. Goodman explains that Christopher is like any usual boy, but that he shows a high degree of intelligence and has never suffered from disease of any kind. He convinces Decker not to do a story or Christopher's life will be ruined. Before leaving, Decker assumes out loud that Goodman named the child \\"Christopher\\" because of Jesus Christ, of whom he was cloned; but the professor rapidly corrects him, claiming that he named him in name of Christopher Columbus, since he believed that the child would usher the world into a new era. Several years later, Decker visits Israel on business and stays with old friends, Joshua and Ilyana Rosen. There he learns much about the historical place and its notable culture. During his visit, Decker receives an anonymous phone call saying that \\"Dogs will cry, but their tears will find no place to land\\" following the shootings of several Palestinians by Israeli troops in a riot. He immediately calls the police and they tell him that the call must have come from Muslim terrorists, making a threat of some kind of massacre or attack against the Jews (to which the callers referred to as \\"the dogs\\"), but they remain uncertain about where they plan to attack. Decker realizes that the terrorists who called him were referring to The Wailing Wall when they said that the Jews tears would have \\"no place to land\\". He rushes to the historical site, just in time to watch it blow up entirely. He saves a young boy from being killed by the blast. In retaliation for the destruction of The Western Wall, Israel destroys the Dome of the Rock and retakes the Temple Mount. Decker later goes to check on the boy, but he is kidnapped by terrorists, along with his companion journalist and long-time friend and confidant, Tom Donafin. They are held captive in an unknown building in Lebanon. He and Tom remain imprisoned for three years. Decker and Tom escape, after one day Decker had a dream of Christopher Goodman, who leads him to the exit. In the dream his captors are dispatched and lie throughout the building. Decker reminds the Dream Christopher that Tom was also held prisoner, and Christopher absent-mindedly shows Decker where he is. Upon waking Decker discovers that his door is unlocked and his captors were dispatched in the same fashion as in his dream, and Tom was right where Christopher had shown him. Decker and Tom then make their escape into the countryside where they are rescued by United Nations troops under none other than the Secretary General, Jon Hansen, with whom Decker forms an instant friendship and bond. They are housed temporarily in Israel, which is under attack by Russians, until it is safe for them to fly home. Transport is arranged for them to get out of the besieged city, however a dogfight in progress causes Tom and Decker to exit the car to document the duel and Tom tries to get pictures. The car, the driver and Tom are hit by a blast from one of the fighter planes. Decker survives, and Tom is assumed dead. It is revealed that Tom, however, does not die. He is stricken blind, however, from the explosion and from flying glass. Decker is informed that Tom's body was never found and he is presumed dead. Decker is finally reunited with his family, and they return to the United States while Decker recovers from captivity. During his recovery period, there is a worldwide catastrophe that seemingly has no explanation. Millions of people wake up next to dead loved ones, and often whole families have died. This event is called \\"The Disaster\\" by most people, however sudden converts to Christianity begin to call it The Rapture. Decker's entire family, along with his friends abroad, The Rosens, perish in the tragedy. Some collateral damage is also suffered: people driving cars suddenly die and their cars careen out of control; some commercial airline pilots die and their planes crash; and other damage occurs. Decker buries his family, and then falls into a catatonic stupor as the weight of his loss consumes him. Later Christopher Goodman arrives at Decker's house explaining that his adoptive parents died in a plane crash piloted by a casualty of the Disaster. Decker shakes off his catatonia and invites Christopher to stay with him, and Christopher becomes his new family. Jon Hansen offers Decker a position as his assistant at the United Nations, where Christopher encounters Robert Milner, a retired Secretary General who is heavily involved in occult practices, and recognizes Christopher as one who has been prophesied in New Age Councils to usher in a new era of peace and prosperity and enhanced consciousness for mankind. Alice Bernley (a thinly veiled reference to Alice Bailey - an actual noted Theosophist), a confidant of Milner's also sees and recognizes Christopher and they befriend him, and Milner assumes the role of mentor to Christopher, not only in politics, but in a worldwide New Age movement. Meanwhile, Jon Hansen has been working on an ambitious project to reorganize the United Nations to better handle operations, and in light of the recent Disaster (The Rapture), he has almost open reign to do what he sees necessary. The UN is restructured with a central government led by the Secretary General, and ten Regional Divisions which include Oceania and Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, the Americas, etc. Each of these regions is led by a Primary Regent who is backed up by an Alternate who serves as proxy when the Primary is absent. Israel is the only nation on earth that refuses to join the UN because Israel's regional partners are all Arab nations that would force them into an extremely unfavorable position of lacking representation within the UN. Meanwhile, Christian Fundamentalists, citing various prophecies in the Biblical Book of Revelation, identify Hansen as the Antichrist or \\"The Beast\\". This, however, quickly ends as Jon Hansen tragically dies when his helicopter crashes in Pakistan during a fact finding mission. The Office of Secretary General falls vacant and remains vacant. None of the Ten Regents believe there was anyone to be a suitable replacement for the extremely charismatic, popular and altruistic Hansen. A rotation schedule is established where each Primary Regent serves as Acting Secretary General for a month. It is deemed that this cycle will continue until a unanimous agreement can be made for Hansen's replacement. Unanimous consent is proven to be almost impossible. Years pass, and Christopher has been elected as the European Alternate Regent. Under the tutelage of Milner and Bernley, Christopher has embraced his spiritual nature, and Decker has provided him with pragmatic and political guidance. Under machinations of Milner and with the cooperation of various groups such as Freemasons and the Knights Templar with the funding from an occult clearinghouse known as The Lucius Trust (a thinly veiled reference to The Lucis Trust), Christopher comes into possession of The Ark of the Covenant. He gives the Ark to Israel as a gift. and in exchange he wants Israel to sign a treaty with the UN. A seven- year treaty is signed promising Israel that they will not be impeded by their neighbors, and UN recognizes their right to exist. When it is proven that the Ark is authentic - proven as Alice Bernley dies from looking inside - Israel agrees, joins the United Nations, and The Ark is placed in the New Temple that was built on the Temple Mount (previously retaken by Israel after the destruction of The Wailing Wall). Albert Faure (previously named Albert Moore in earlier printings), an extremely aggressive and deft manipulator - as well as the Primary Regent of Europe - sets in motion a plan that he hopes will gain him the position of Secretary General. Meanwhile, Christopher, following a Spirit guide sets off into the desert for guidance after a series of extremely unsettling dreams about God and an impending feeling of global doom. When Christopher's journey into the desert nears its completion (after 40 days and 40 nights), Milner leads Decker to the desert where he says they will encounter Christopher who will need their assistance. Christopher's \\"vision quest\\" has revealed Faure's plan to him, and he intends to stop it. However, they learn that Christopher is too late, because Faure's plan has already culminated in several strategic assassinations, as well as the declaration and execution of the China-India-Pakistan war, a nuclear conflict that lasts a single day, yet ends with hundreds of millions of casualties. No clear winner was declared or recognized in this war; however, Faure uses the incident to catapult himself into a position of power, at which time he forces a vote for Secretary General. He expects unanimous consent due to bribery, force, blackmail and threats against the other Regents, and he is widely expected to win. Just as the vote for Secretary General is under way, Christopher shows up at the United Nations and announces that Faure was responsible for the assassinations and is the single man who is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions in the China-India-Pakistan war. Faure denies this, but Christopher insists, and commands Faure to confess. Seemingly under the power of Christopher Goodman, Faure does confess, and then immediately drops dead in front of everyone at the United Nations. It is concluded that Faure died under the weight of his own guilt, but Decker and Robert Milner realize that Christopher has extraordinary powers and he was beginning to exercise them.

Gonzales, 549 U.S. 47 (2006), held that an \\"aggravated felony\\" includes only conduct punishable as a felony under the federal Controlled Substances Act, regardless of whether state law classifies such conduct as a felony or a misdemeanor. Under federal law, there are two main consequences of having a prior conviction for an \\"aggravated felony.\\" One is that, if the convicted person is an alien, he will be deported. The other is that, with respect to certain federal crimes, a prior conviction for an aggravated felony provides a sentencing enhancement. In this case, Lopez had been convicted of conduct that was a felony under South Dakota law but was a misdemeanor under federal law. Accordingly, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that this conviction could not serve as a basis for deporting him.  Background  Lopez entered the United States illegally from Mexico in 1986, but became a lawful permanent resident in 1990. In 1997, he pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the possession of cocaine in a South Dakota court, and served 15 months in prison. When he was released, the INS sought to deport him because, it claimed, he had been convicted of a controlled substances violation and an \\"aggravated felony.\\" An Immigration Judge ordered him deported, and the Board of Immigration Appeals ultimately affirmed that decision. Lopez petitioned for review in the Eighth Circuit, which the court denied. Because there was a conflict in the federal courts of appeals on how to classify crimes such as Lopez's, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Souter wrote for the majority. As is frequently the case with regard to immigration cases, the Court had to examine the interplay of federal and state laws that are complex in their phrasing. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), an aggravated felony includes \\"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance... including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18).\\" (a)(43)(B). A \\"drug trafficking crime,\\" in turn, refers to \\"any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act [the CSA] ( et seq.).\\" The term \\"aggravated felony\\" \\"applies to an offense whether in violation of Federal of State law and applies to such an offense in violation of the law of a foreign country for which the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous 15 years.\\" Under South Dakota law, aiding and abetting the possession of cocaine is equivalent to possessing cocaine, and that crime is a felony. Mere possession is not a felony under the CSA unless the amount of the drug possessed is greater than that normally kept for personal use. Where federal law treats certain conduct as a misdemeanor, and state law treats that same conduct as a felony, does that conduct constitute an \\"aggravated felony\\" or not? To answer this question, the Court had to parse the phrase \\"any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\\" The Government argued that Lopez's South Dakota conviction qualified as an aggravated felony because it was (1) a felony, because South Dakota law made it a felony; that (2) was punishable under the CSA, because it is a crime under the CSA to possess a controlled substance, albeit a misdemeanor. This interpretation ignored the fact that to qualify as an \\"aggravated felony,\\" the crime in question had to relate to trafficking in a controlled substance. Possession is not trafficking, the Court reasoned, because possession lacks a connection to commerce. \\"Reading ¬ß 924(c) the Government's way, then, would turn simple possession into trafficking, just what the English language tells us not to expect, and that result makes us very wary of the Government's position.\\" As the INA provides, all \\"felonies punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\\" are drug trafficking crimes; thus, the place to go to determine what crimes are \\"felonies punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\\" is the Act itself. The term \\"aggravated felony\\" is one of federal law, and the Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter of the meaning of federal law, including the meaning of words Congress uses when it crafts statutes. Congress could have expressly relied on state law to classify crimes as aggravated felonies. Since it did not, the Court reasoned, the class of crimes that constitute aggravated felonies must be defined in federal law. Hence, \\"unless a state offense is punishable as a federal felony it does not count\\" as an \\"aggravated felony.\\" In the Court's opinion, Government's gloss on the statutory phrase was not consistent with ordinary English usage. Because the words \\"punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\\" followed directly after the word \\"punishable,\\" the Court reasoned that the most sensible meaning of the phrase was \\"a felony punishable as such by the Controlled Substances Act.\\" The Government pointed out that the term \\"aggravated felony\\" applies to any offense \\"whether in violation of Federal or State law.\\" This qualification, it argued, showed that Congress intended for state law to determine whether conduct qualified as an aggravated felony. The Court read this language in the opposite way the Government did. But this gloss would \\"wrench[] the expectations raised by normal English usage.\\" This qualifying language \\"confirms that a state offense whose elements include the elements of a felony punishable under the CSA is an aggravated felony.\\" Furthermore, the fact that the Government had never prosecuted anyone under ¬ß 924(c) where the underlying \\"drug trafficking crime\\" was a state felony but a federal misdemeanor belied the Government's interpretation. Moreover, the Government's interpretation would make federal immigration law dependent on the vagaries of state criminal law, at least with respect to alien removal and eligibility for asylum. If Congress had meant the term \\"aggravated felony\\" to bear some generic meaning, and thus to depend to some extent on state law, it would not have expressly referenced another federal statute, such as ¬ß 924(c), in defining this category of aggravated felony. Put another way, it was not clear that Congress intended that a state conviction for felony possession of up to 30 grams of marijuana--a crime treated as a misdemeanor under federal law--should count as an aggravated felony while a state conviction for misdemeanor possession of 5 grams of cocaine--a crime treated as a felony under federal law--should not.  Dissenting opinion  Justice Thomas accepted the Government's interpretation of the phrase \\"felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\\" Because Lopez's crime was a felony under South Dakota law, and the CSA provided for punishment for his crime, he had committed an aggravated felony. \\"The classification [of a crime as a felony or a misdemeanor] depends only on the authorized term of imprisonment.\\" External links Brief of Petitioner Lopez * Brief of the Solicitor General on behalf of the Government * Amicus brief of the ACLU * Amicus brief of the American Bar Association * Information about applying Lopez from the American Immigration Law Foundation * Information about applying Lopez from the New York State Defenders Association Immigrant Defense Project United States Supreme Court cases United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court United States immigration and naturalization case law 2006 in United States case law Cocaine in the United States United States controlled substances case law Legal history of South Dakota Mexico‚ÄìUnited States relations ","title":"Lopez v.

Over time the protective hardcoat breaks down with UV degradation and wear from abrasion, etc. If left untreated the headlights will eventually develop small surface cracks, a condition referred to as crazing. The effectiveness of the headlight in terms of light output measured in lux can be significantly reduced. This condition which results in hazy and discoloured lenses is known for causing reduced night time visibility for drivers as the condition becomes worse. It is possible for cloudy and hazy headlights to be restored to a like-new condition and represents typically a far more economical alternative than replacing the lens. Additionally, headlight restoration extends the usable life of the headlight assembly, can be repeated if necessary and is considerably \\"greener\\" than disposal and replacement of headlights. Professional headlight restoration services There are a number of professional headlight restoration services that charge approximately $100 to $250 to restore both headlights on a vehicle. Replacing the lens can be much more expensive. There are many do-it-yourself headlight restoration kits available on the market. Some professional headlight restoration shops apply a urethane or acrylic clear coat to help protect the plastic lens from UV exposure after the headlight lens is restored. DIY headlight restoration products There are many \\"do it yourself\\" headlight restoration kits available for purchase. A few of the major brands that produce these \\"kits\\" include Klear, LensBoost, 3M, Turtle Wax, Sylvania, Headlight Wizard, Meguiar's, Mothers, Rain-X, Wipe New by Rust-OleumRust- Oleumhttps://truworthhomes.com/blogs/diy/diy-guide-how-to-wipe-away-oxidation- your-headlight. Most of these kits require multiple stages of wet sanding to remove the oxidation of the headlight lens, usually with descending level of grit (coarse to fine). Some kits include a UV sealant which is said to protect the lens of the headlight longer. Kits with the UV sealant include some of the 3M, Sylvania, and Headlight Wizard. Typically the DIY sealant requires regular periodic reapplication and is not equivalent to the original OEM hardcoat applied during manufacturing. Another option to delay the aging process of headlight lenses, is the use of press and snap-on headlight covers, or laminates with adhesives that can be applied over the headlight lenses, such as Paint Protection Film sold by 3M.

Founding Drawing of former UCC campus at King and Simcoe Streets in downtown Toronto Upper Canada College was founded in 1829 by then-Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, Major-General Sir John Colborne (later Lord Seaton), to serve as a feeder school to the newly established King's College (later the University of Toronto). It was modelled on the great public schools of Britain, most notably Eton.Upper Canada College, 1829-1979: Colborne's Legacy; Howard, Richard; Macmillan Company of Canada, 1979Upper Canada College: History Though now a private school, the college was created with public funds including an initial land grant of 6,000 acres of crown lands, later supplemented with an additional 60,000 acres. An announcement of the College's January opening appeared in the December 17, 1829, edition of the Canada Gazette, and teaching at the College began on January 4, 1830, with 57 students; the first boy enrolled being Henry Scadding. By the end of the school's first semester, the enrolment had increased to 89. By the end of the first year of operation, UCC had admitted 140 pupils and employed a principal and eight masters. Prior to 1829, the College was called the Royal Grammar School; its first permanent buildings stood on Russell Square, on land that is now bounded by King, Simcoe, Adelaide and John Streets in downtown Toronto. Almost immediately after the College opened, plans were implemented for newer and more permanent buildings, and the 1831 school year began in new structures at the north-west corner of King and Simcoe Streets (now 212 King Street West). The new school was praised by some; the Reverend Thomas Radcliffe stated in an 1833 letter: \\"Future generations will bless the memory of Sir John Colborne, who, to the many advantages derived from the equity and wisdom of his government, has added that of a magnificent foundation [in Upper Canada College] for the purposes of literary instruction. The lowest salary of any of the professors of this institution is ¬£30 per annum, with the accommodation of a noble brick house and the privilege of taking boarders at ¬£50 per annum.\\"Education In Upper Canada From 1783 To 1844; 1912 However, the costs of the new buildings, combined with the large staff and their high salaries, led to criticism of the College and its expenses. In his publication Colonial Advocate, William Lyon Mackenzie stated: \\"The College here at York in Upper Canada is most extravagantly endowed... thousands of pounds are realised at will by its self-constituted managers from the sale of school lots and school lands [in fact, not true]... splendid incomes given to masters... and dwellings furnished to the professors... by the sweat of the brow of the Canadian labourer.\\"Mackenzie, William Lyon; Colonial Advocate, May 19, 1831 In 1837, UCC's student militia offered help to Sir Francis Bond Head's Family Compact government in suppressing Mackenzie's pro-responsible government Upper Canada Rebellion. In 1852, Mackenzie's sons, William and George, were enrolled at UCC. University control On March 4, 1837, the King's College charter was amended to take UCC in under the control of the university, with the principal to be appointed by the King, and the vice-principal and masters nominated by the Chancellor of King's College (the Lieutenant-Governor) at the approval of the King's College Council. In 1838, UCC was searching for a new principal and asked the Archbishop of Canterbury William Howley for a suggestion. John McCaul was put forward. He accepted and took the post on 29 January 1839. In 1842, Charles Dickens visited the College and said of it: \\"a sound education in every department of polite learning can be had, at a very moderate expense... It has pretty good endowments in the way of land, and is a valuable and useful institution.\\"Dickens, Charles; American Notes. Cited in The College Times, Summer 1910, pg. 30. Watercolour of UCC's dining hall by John Howard, in 1842 By 1887, despite an enrolment of 300 that was quickly outgrowing the 1831 buildings, UCC came close to closing its doors when a Liberal provincial government, which supported university federation and saw the College's endowment and downtown campus as sources of funds for such an expensive venture, came to power. That year a Notice of Motion was introduced to the Legislature by a Liberal Member named Waters: \\"in the opinion of this House the time has come when Upper Canada College should be abolished... as the instruction given in the College can be obtained in any well conducted high school in the province,\\"John D. Robart's Research Library, University of Toronto, Newspaper Hansard, March 12, 1887. adding that the College's real estate should go to the province. In reaction to this, a group of Old Boys met, along with letters of support from various alumni, including Lieutenant Governor John Beverley Robinson, in an effort to stop the closing of the College. The meeting ended with a unanimous motion that the group's views be laid before the government. The story was covered widely in the papers of the time, with the Evening Telegram being most supportive, the Globe taking a more moderate stance, and the News criticizing the existence of the school. In the end, after much negotiation, a decision was reached to detach the school from King's College after fifty years of affiliation, and to operate it under the guidance of five trustees appointed by the Minister of Education. The College was also to be relocated to an area outside of the city, though this provision was not included in the statute. Move Upper Canada College buildings at Deer Park On July 3, 1891, the bell at the Russell Square campus rang for the last time, and on August 29, a farewell cricket game was played. The Upper Canada College Old Boys' Association was created on the same day.Upper Canada College association UCC then moved to its current site, the Deer Park campus (), 200 Lonsdale Road at Avenue Road in Forest Hill, with the doors being officially opened on October 14, 1891.

Co., circa 1896.Upper Canada College march and two-step http://amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/c.php?id=5364138&l;=eng&s;=amicus In 1902, a separate Preparatory School was built at the south edge of the campus, creating two physically separate schools. World Wars More than 400 graduates perished during both the First and Second World Wars, the first being Lt. C. Gordon Mackenzie of the Royal Scots Fusiliers, on October 24, 1914. By the end of WWI, 176 Old Boys were dead.Howard, Richard; Upper Canada College, 1829-1979: Colborne's Legacy; Macmillan Company of Canada, 1979; Pg. 173 Ambulance purchased by the boys of UCC in 1916 One year later the Upper Canada College ambulance was presented to the forces, and was delivered to France at the beginning of 1916. By May the next year the vehicle had travelled almost three thousand miles, and carried five thousand wounded men. The outbreak of the Second World War saw the College lose a number of its best masters, although the majority were too old to join and remained behind at the school. UCC welcomed a large number of war refugees; by May 1941 there were ninety seven. The increasing number led to some concern amongst the Board of Governors, as these students were not paying tuition. A war chest was also started for the purpose of sending packages to Old Boys, and help support the children of Old Boys killed or wounded in battle.Howard, Richard; Upper Canada College, 1829-1979: Colborne's Legacy; Macmillan Company of Canada, 1979 Historian Jack Granatstein, in his book The Generals, demonstrated that UCC graduates accounted for more than 30% of Canadian generals during the Second World War, including General Harry Crerar, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the First Canadian Army, and Major-General Bruce Matthews, General Officer Commanding the 2nd Canadian Division and later Chairman of the College's Board of Governors. In total, 26 Old Boys achieved brigadier rank or higher in WWII.Killbourn, William; Toronto Remembered; Soddart Publishing, Toronto; 1984; Pg. 168 In 1923 The War Book of Upper Canada College was published, commemorating each Old Boy who served in the \\"Great War\\" of 1914‚Äì1918. Those who gave their lives are contained in a separate section.The War Book of Upper Canada College; Toronto (1914-1919); Published 1923 There are also two gilt boards in the College's main foyer that commemorate the names of the dead, one for each World War. After the War: Vincent Massey's influence During the time of the Rev. Sowby's regime as principal, Vincent Massey rekindled his interest in the college, and, during the latter's time as Governor General, often discussed the College's circumstances with Sowby. They worked together to bring in distinguished guests to address the students and/or inspect the College. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent laid a cornerstone for the College's Memorial Wing,Upper Canada College: Then & Now and Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery inspected the cadets, declaring them \\"the best cadet corps he had encountered in his career.\\" It was also during this time that the medieval office of Visitor was revived at UCC, with Prince Philip being the first occupant.Killbourn, William; Toronto Remembered; Soddart Publishing, Toronto; 1984 UCC's chapel was built in the early 1950s, funded by Massey and dedicated to his wife, Alice Parkin, who was the daughter of UCC principal George Parkin. Sowby had a piece of the altar cloth used at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II donated for use in the chapel, and the dean of St. Paul's Cathedral gave marble from the ruins of the parts of the structure destroyed by bombing during WWII. During one of Massey's visits to UCC, as Sowby was guiding the party through the main quadrangle, two ladies spotted the letters \\"F-U-C-K\\" chalked upside down on the bricks below one of the main tower windows. Massey stated \\"it looks like Russian to me,\\" but after donning his glasses, realised what it said, and assured the principal that these things happened in the best of schools. The offending students, both 14-year-olds, owned up to the crime, and were ordered to write an apology to the Governor General. Massey immediately responded to them.Killbourn, William; Toronto Remembered; Soddart Publishing, Toronto; 1984; Pg. 186-187 Building crisis The College faced a crisis at the end of the 1950s when it was discovered that the 1891 main building was decaying rapidly due to poor construction; cracks were appearing throughout, pipes split, and doors frames warped to the point where doors could no longer be opened or closed. Due to fear that the tower would collapse the building was condemned and evacuated by March 12, 1958;Principal Jim Power, Founder's Day Assembly, Feb. 2, 2006 faculty offices were moved to the Prep building, the infirmary, and any other spare spaces, including the principal's residence, Grant House. Classes were conducted in portables. That same year, a major fundraising campaign was launched as construction of a new building on the exact site of the old was started. Prince Philip visited in 1959 to assist with the fundraising, and money to reconstruct the iconic tower over the main entrance was donated by the media magnate, Ted Rogers. In the summer of 1959, Governor General Massey laid the cornerstone, however, the pleasure with progress was marred when tragedy struck that same year: an Italian construction worker fell from the tower to his death. None-the-less, Field Marshal Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein dedicated the new front doors on April 28, 1960, and the new building was officially opened by Vincent Massey and Edward Peacock on September 28. The $3,200,000 cost of the building was fully subscribed. Late 20th century UCC welcomed the first woman to its Board of Governors in 1971 with the appointment of Pauline Mills McGibbon, although she resigned in 1974 upon her appointment to the post of Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario. Five years following her departure, UCC celebrated its 150th anniversary in the presence of the College's Official Visitor, Prince Philip, at the College's first Association Day, and Sandi Ryder became the first woman elected to the College's Board of Governors. By 1980 boarding for Prep students ended, with some of the dormitories being converted to computer labs where students learned the fostering technology. In 1991, UCC was visited by the Hungarian President √Årp√°d G√∂ncz, who would soon after enrol his grandson at the school,Current Times: Association News and Notes; September 2002; Pg. 6 and in 1993, Prince Philip again visited to officially open the Foster Hewitt Athletic Centre, the Eaton Building, as well as the rebuilt College gates, the Mara Gates, at the foot of the main avenue.HRH Prince Philip's private and official visits to Canada since 1953 Two years later the College decided to greatly alter its academic course and adopted the International Baccalaureate programme. James FitzGerald, a UCC Old Boy himself, published a book in 1994 titled Old Boys; the Powerful Legacy of Upper Canada College. It stirred up some controversy in Canadian media due to its candid portrayal of life at the College, derived from excerpts of interviews that FitzGerald had conducted with former students, ranging from Conrad Black and Michael Ignatieff to unknowns who managed gas stations or worked in retail. Reactions varied; Charlotte Gray wrote in the Toronto Star: \\"My reaction to this book is fascinated revulsion - mainly because the school seems to have taught successive generations of boys that girls are some alien species that is both terrifying and stupid,\\" while Jill Rigby said in the Toronto Sun: \\"Yeah, so what if some UCC teachers were pedophiles? All that stuff has been going on in educational institutions since Socrates met Plato.\\" The publication of the book had an effect on the College, both in its internal structure, as well as its relationship with the broader community. Peter Dalglish, the founder of Street Kids International, criticised the school heavily in his interview for Old Boys, where he said \\"A prime failing of UCC is that they have no sense of being a part of a community within the city or country. The school has to change; it is still very upper middle class.\\" Subsequently, he was hired by the College to change school culture. Under his direction, along with Nanci Goldman, the former Toronto Board co-ordinator of inner city services, UCC students have since been partnered with inner city Toronto kids in the College's Horizon program. The Eaton Building was extended in 1999 to accommodate the school's curricular expansion to include grades 1 and 2. Senior kindergarten was introduced in 2003. New millennium Early into the new millennium, UCC followed the trend in environmentalism when the Board of Governors voted to establish the Green School initiative in 2002, wherein environmental education would become \\"one of the four hallmarks of a UCC education.\\" This education would include ecological literacy, environmental ethics, and contributions to broader society.Current Times: Governors Agree: UCC to be a Green School; September 2002; Pg. 2 which would see not only upgrades of the school's physical plant to meet environmentally sustainable standards, but also an integration of these new initiatives into the curriculum.Current Times: Executive Director of Green School sought; December 2002; Pg. 5 Cadets Upper Canada College Cadets, 1893 There is no definite date for the formation of the Upper Canada College Cadets, though beginnings can be traced to a willingness of students to participate in the defence against the 1837 rebellion in Upper Canada. Later in the 1800s, in schools throughout England, Canada and the United States, involvement in a military body was thought of to inspire patriotism in young men, as well as teaching discipline and obedience. By 1863, UCC students were paraded weekly, in an amateur fashion, under Major Goodwin, but with the beginning of Fenian troubles in Upper Canada in 1865, UCC students requested that the Cadets form into a company of The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada. By 1866, the request was fulfilled, making UCC possibly the second school in Canada to have a proper Cadet Corps (the first being Bishop's College School in Lennoxville, Quebec). When the Fenians did attack Fort Erie, Ontario, on June 1, 1866 (see Fenian Raids), the UCC Cadets, along with the Bishop's College Cadets, were called to duty, but were instructed only to guard the armouries and official stores. None-the-less, this was the only time in Canadian military history where student Cadet Corps were called to duty. By the 1890s, there was a lack of enthusiasm for the Cadets. It was an extra expense for a student's family to cover the costs of uniform, weapons, and even their drill instructor. As well, drill and practice time was beyond the commitment to scholastics and sport. Enrolment fluctuated over the next few decades, at one point the school's administration turning its eyes to the school the College had been modelled on, Eton, as well as Harrow, where Cadet participation was compulsory. No real action was taken by UCC in regards to the Cadets; however, by 1910 the population of the company had increased to 63, and in 1912 a Sergeant Carpenter was approached to act as an instructor. He was not to last long, as by 1914 he was in Europe as Sergeant-Major in the 9th Battalion of the 1st Canadian Overseas Contingent. Numbers in the UCC Cadets still stayed high during the First World War. By around 1919, the UCC Cadets became compulsory, and principal Grant asked the army district headquarters if the Corps could be presented with Colours, both the King's Colour and College Colour. The College Colour was given by Elanor Gooderham in 1921. During the war, the Cadets' association with the Queen's Own Rifles had lapsed, and by 1923 two regiments, the Toronto Regiment and Queen's Own Rifles were requesting that the Corps affiliate itself with them. After some dispute between the three parties, the College settled on the Queen's Own again by 1927. For thirty following years, the Cadets remained a part of College life, and by the middle of the Second World War boys were practising not only drills, but also spent time on lectures, map reading, military law, and signalling. The biggest ceremony of the school year was the Battalion Inspection Day, when the cadet corps would assemble in their dress uniforms, consisting of navy-blue uniforms and berets, black leather boots and spats, white gloves; officers also wore a sword and Sam Browne, sergeants a red sash. The guns carried were Ross .303s.Killbourn, William; Toronto Remembered; Soddart Publishing, Toronto; 1984; Pg. 178 By the 1960s belief in the Cadets was faltering; religion and patriotism were not held in such high regard by youth, and rebellion was the more accepted behaviour for teenagers. Minutes of the Board of Governors meeting in 1965 recorded, for the first time in sixty years, poor discipline at the battalion parade. Principal Richard Sadlier disbanded the Cadet Battalion as a compulsory body in 1976, noting: \\"The Battalion has been left with little beyond its ceremonial drill which is a pretty irrelevant exercise to many people today and difficult to defend when it becomes the be-all and end-all of a program.\\" In 1977, the voluntary Royal Canadian Army Cadets helped organize a course in military science at UCC, which also included battle drill, field craft, weapons training, and some parade-square drill. But, by the mid-1980s, interest in this programme had fallen to a bare minimum, and today UCC provides no formal military training. Ethnic and gender issues UCC began admitting ethnic minority students early in its history. The first black student enrolled in 1831 the first Jewish student in 1836 and the first aboriginal student in 1840; some graduates from the Ojibway peoples of Upper Canada having gone on to study at Dartmouth College and Harvard University.Borrows, John; \\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?\\" The Diversification of Canadian Law Schools Even though there have been ethnic minority students admitted to UCC, the school continued to maintain a reputation as a \\"bastion of WASP privilege\\" through the first 150 years of its history.Kirshner, Sheldon; Canadian Jewish News: Peter Newman looks back on a productive life In relation to this, diplomat James George, a student between 1926 and 1936, said upon reflection about his time with other UCC graduates in the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs: \\"If UCC really was a womb matrix for a bunch of WASP patriots, why did it produce so many internationalists?\\" Other former students took a different view, some citing experiences of anti-Semitism. Graham Fraser, The Globe and Mail's Washington Bureau Chief, who attended UCC between 1960 and 1964, recalled: \\"Anti-Semitism was generally an unspoken undercurrent at UCC, but a couple of times I witnessed overt anti-Semitism.... Before 1960, Toronto was a pretty narrow, close-minded, little Victorian town and Upper Canada College reflected that reality.\\" At the same time, Peter C. Newman, who came to UCC from Czechoslovakia in 1940, and who is Jewish himself, said that anti-Semitism was \\"virtually non-existent\\" at the school.Howard, Pg. 239 Michael Ignatieff, who was a student at the College from 1959 to 1965 stated: \\"The UCC culture in my time was basically Tory, Anglican and fantastically patrician... The Canadian elite must be an open, permeable elite which is colour blind, religion blind and gender blind. There has to be an elite based not even on intelligence but character. They will mostly come from schools that bear no resemblance to Upper Canada College.\\" In the decades after the 1970s, some saw the ethnic composition of the school's enrollment as changing. In 1979, former Prep School Headmaster Richard Howard said in his book Upper Canada College, 1929-1979: Colborne's Legacy: \\"The growth of the enrolment has increased the number of boys from a wide variety of backgrounds and decreased the ratio of those from old Toronto families. The address list now reflects Toronto's ethnic variety and resembles a small United Nations.\\"Howard, Richard; Upper Canada College, 1829-1979: Colborne's Legacy; Macmillan Company of Canada; 1979; pg. 264 William Kilbourn also said that the College had been accepting, for many years before the 1980s, a number of foreign students, notably from Latin America and Asia, and that UCC had made a concentrated effort to recruit Quebec francophones into the student body. By the 1980s the school was offering financial assistance to the less affluent, and was making serious attempts to encourage boys from visible minorities to enroll. But, few applied, save for many Chinese, East Indian, and Japanese Canadians who were accepted into the Prep; in 1983 the numbers were 42 out of a total student population of 361.Killbourn, William; Toronto Remembered; Soddart Publishing, Toronto; 1984; Pg. 190 However, even into the 1990s some, while acknowledging the shift to a more multi-cultural student body, claimed anti-Semitism continued in some form. In 1990, The College Times featured an editorial stating that while UCC was no longer \\"a white-bread, right-wing fortress: it has become much more multi-cultural and (dare I say it?) liberal.... In my years at UCC I have faced anti-Semitism, ugliness, stupidity and bureaucracy.\\"Sherman, Motek; College Times: Editorial; 1990 By the late 1990s, the college was increasingly diverse, and in 1997 the daily recitation of the Lord's Prayer was replaced by the recitation of a prayer from different global faiths each day. In 2002, student Adam Sheikh created the Diversity Council to celebrate the cultural diversity of the school's student population. This council, a body of students independent from the school administration, organizes celebrations of Chinese, Jewish, and Ukrainian cultural events and traditions, as well as Canadian cultural events.Harmony Scholarship UCC's website states that \\"the College's boarding program welcomes Upper School students from all faiths and cultural backgrounds. Each year, more than 100 students from Year 1 to IB2 come together in this cross-cultural hub, where students benefit from each other's unique experiences.\\" Students from about 16 countries attend UCC. The international students typically come from among the wealthiest families in the countries of their origin. The 1990 College Times also addressed alleged sexism at the school in the article The School On The Hill by Greg Tessaro, winner of the College Times' Ponton Prize for Journalism. The article stated: :\\"The school fosters sexist attitudes that impair the students.... There is undeniably sexism at the school. The '88 Times had a running joke in the Leaving Class section, \\"Why beer is better than women\\", with examples like \\"Fact #19: Beer doesn't demand equality\\" ...A careful look through past yearbooks reveals a sexist viewpoint that would not be tolerated at a co-ed school. The school itself is the direct cause of this sexism. ...The school teaches sexism by example. ...In addition, on a staff of over sixty full-time teachers, there are three women. However, in my time at the College, the French conversation teacher has always been a woman. The librarians are all women. The secretaries are all women.\\"Tessaro, Greg; College Times: The School On The Hill; 1990; Pg. 154-155 UCC did, however, appoint the first woman to its Board of Governors in 1971; Pauline Mills McGibbon. The College also states: :\\"We value diversity and are actively engaged in building a school that reflects the various backgrounds of our community members. We recognize that embracing a mix of cultures, talents, backgrounds, experiences and socioeconomic diversity will make the College a more rewarding place in which to learn and work.\\"Upper Canada College: Career Opportunities Scandals Upper Canada College has had a number of incidents in the decade following 1998 where staff were accused of statutory rape or of possessing child pornography. Only three ended in convictions. In early February 2007, the school mailed a letter to the entire UCC community apologizing for the sexual and physical abuse at the school and referring to the abuse of students as the most difficult issue the school has had to face in its 177-year history. _Clark Winton Noble_ :In 1998, Clark Winton Noble (\\"Knobby\\") was convicted of sexual assault stemming from an event that occurred in 1988 against a student at Appleby College where he was teaching. At that time he also admitted to an earlier attack on a UCC student in 1971, when he was a teacher at the school, though he was never convicted of that crime as the charges were withdrawn.Appleby, Timothy and Cheney, Peter; Globe and Mail: Sexual predator at private schools pardoned; October 19, 2006 The incident occurred off- campus, and the student never notified the school of what went on until Noble had resigned from the College. After learning of what went on, UCC informed Noble's subsequent employer and the Toronto Police.Power, Jim; Open letter to UCC community, re. National Parole Board's ruling; October 20, 2006 _Doug Brown_ :In 2003, UCC was embroiled in a very public class action lawsuit brought by eighteen students, led by a former pupil, who sued the school over sexual abuse by Doug Brown, a member of the faculty who taught history, geography and English at the prep school from 1975 until 1993.Ontario Superior Court of Justice Statement of Claim: Yvan J.M. Prodeus vs. Douglas Ian Brown, Douglas Blakey and Upper Canada College In October 2004, Doug Brown was found guilty of nine counts of indecent assault, while a housemaster and teacher at UCC.CBC News: Ontario private school teacher found guilty of abusing boys; October 8, 2004 In January 2005, he was sentenced to three years in jail. An appeal is currently in the works. A settlement was reached between the victims and the college. In a media release, UCC has announced that they \\"continue to offer [their] support to those who were victims of abuse at the College, and [they] are committed to a fair process for determining the school's responsibility to compensate those who were victimized by Doug Brown.\\" _Ashley Chivers_ :In 2003, UCC graduate, and later teaching assistant, Ashley Chivers, then 28, who had been working at the school since 1996, was arrested on child pornography charges after police (acting on a tip from California law enforcement) found evidence of criminal images on his home computers.Cheney, Peter; Globe and Mail: Child porn charges laid against teaching assistant; June 11, 2003 Chivers' duties at UCC included taking pictures at school events, though after a search of the 6,000 illegal images in his possession, Toronto police confirmed no UCC students, past or present, were evident. Chivers was convicted of one count of possessing child pornography, but not creating it, and was given an 18-month conditional sentence in October, 2004.Bradley, Kim; Toronto Sun: UCC aide sentenced; October 15, 2004 _Lorne Cook_ :Lorne Cook, a teacher at UCC from 1978 to 1994, who was found guilty on October 12, 2006, of two counts of sexual assault on UCC students in 1991 and 1993. He was acquitted of one count of indecent assault and one count of sexual interference. The judge told the court that Cook touched his pupils inappropriately as a way to control and abuse the students without their consent, saying Cook has abused his \\"significant power in a way that violated the sexual integrity\\" of his pupils, and not for reasons of sexual gratification. In the November 2006 sentencing, he was spared jail time and instead sentenced to house arrest.Pazzano, Sam; Toronto Sun: No jail for teacher in sex assault; November 23, 2006 In response to the allegations put forward, UCC formed a review team to assess school policies, and create new ones, under the direction of Sydney Robins, QC, a former Justice of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and author of Protecting Our Students: A Review to Identify and Prevent Sexual Misconduct in Ontario Schools.

This procedure is performed to assess pituitary function, adrenal function, insulin sensitivity, and sometimes for other purposes. An ITT is usually ordered and interpreted by endocrinologists. When used to assess insulin sensitivity, a standard dose of insulin is administered, and blood glucose is monitored with frequent sampling; the plasma glucose disappearance rate (KITT) indicates the degree of whole-body insulin sensitivity, and correlates well with the gold-standard glucose clamp technique. When used for assessing the integrity of the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis (HPA), insulin injections are continued to the point of inducing extreme hypoglycemia below 2.2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl). Patient must have symptomatic neuroglycopenia to trigger counter-regulatory cascade. Glucose levels below 2.2 mmol/L are insufficient absent symptoms. The brain must register low glucose levels. In response, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and growth hormone (GH) are released as a part of the stress mechanism. ACTH elevation causes the adrenal cortex to release cortisol. Normally, both cortisol and GH serve as counterregulatory hormones, opposing the action of insulin, i.e. acting against the hypoglycemia. ITT to the point of extreme hypoglycemia is considered to be the gold standard for assessing the integrity of the HPA. Sometimes ITT is performed to assess the peak adrenal capacity, e.g. before surgery. It is assumed that the ability to respond to insulin induced hypoglycemia translates into appropriate cortisol rise in the stressful event of acute illness or major surgery.The extreme hypoglycemic version of the ITT is potentially very dangerous and must be undertaken with great care, because it can iatrogenically induce the equivalent of a diabetic coma. A health professional must attend it at all times.Other provocation tests which cause much less release of growth hormone include the use of glucagon, arginine and clonidine. Side effects Side effects include sweating, palpitations, loss of consciousness and rarely convulsions due to severe hypoglycemia which may cause coma. If extreme symptoms are present, glucose should be given intravenously. In subjects with no adrenal reserve an Addisonian crisis may occur. For cortisol stimulation, the ACTH stimulation test has much less risk. Contraindications Insulin tolerance test contraindications are: * This test should not be performed on children outside a specialist pediatric endocrine unit. * Ischemic heart disease * Epilepsy * Severe panhypopituitarism, hypoadrenalism * Hypothyroidism impairs the GH and cortisol response. Patients should have corticosteroid replacement commenced prior to thyroxine as the latter has been reported to precipitate an Addisonian crisis with dual deficiency. If adrenal insufficiency is confirmed, the need for a repeat ITT may need to be reconsidered after 3 months thyroxine therapy. Interpretation The test cannot be interpreted unless hypoglycaemia (< 2.2 mmol/L (or) < 40 mg/dl) is achieved. Hypopituitarism An adequate cortisol response is defined as a rise to greater than 550 nmol/L. Patients with impaired cortisol responses (less than 550 but greater than 400 nmol/L) may only need steroid cover for major illnesses or stresses. An adequate GH response occurs with an absolute response exceeding 20 mU/L. Cushing's syndrome There will be a rise of less than 170 nmol/L above the fluctuations of basal levels of cortisol.

It is the newest and the fastest growing. It is the home of the University of Lethbridge and is a residential area primarily. History West Lethbridge is geographically isolated by a loop in the Oldman River to the west, south and east. Lethbridge proper is across the river to the east. The first bridge across the river opened in November 1890 at a cost of $38,000. As Lethbridge continued to grow in the middle of the 20th century, the 1969 General Plan recommended westward expansion of the city across the Oldman River. As a result of this recommendation, the Oldman River Regional Planning Commission prepared the report \\"The Urbanization of West Lethbridge\\" in 1969. This report proposed West Lethbridge development as a village concept. Each village would include a school, a major park and a commercial centre. Each village was planned to be approximately one square mile in area, contain two neighbourhoods of roughly 6,000 persons each and bounded by arterial roads. This concept still serves as a framework for development in West Lethbridge. The report was prepared for a first phase of development up to 30,000 residents. By the time the city began including West Lethbridge in its census in 1971, there were fewer than 70 residents. By the following year, 254 residents lived here. This was also the year the University of Lethbridge moved to the Westside. Demographics The 2006 municipal census reported West Lethbridge had a population of 27,154. Since the 1970s, the area has seen an average population increase of 18%, not including the years of 1972 and 1976, when it saw increases of 274% and 281% respectively. The bulk of the city's growth since the early 1990s has been on the west side. Its population is younger than North and South Lethbridge, with only 3% over age 65.

Shopping centres include MicMac Plaza, West Village Mall, and the regional shopping centre West Lethbridge Towne Centre. The urban park Nicholas Sheran Park is on the Westside as is the Nicholas Sheran Leisure Centre, an aquatic centre and ice arena. In addition to the University of Lethbridge, education services are provided by three public elementary schools, one public middle school, three private elementary schools, and two high schools (one private and one public). Another major park in Lethbridge is West Highlands Park with amenities such as a lake, walking paths, covered and uncovered patio areas. Currently under development is the Crossings Leisure Complex. Development In 2004, Lethbridge City Council announced plans for the second phase of growth in West Lethbridge, covering a 600 hectare (1,483 acre) area west of Indian Battle Heights and Varsity Village. In 2006, the council voted to put $12 million toward the West Lethbridge Centre. Once complete, the centre would serve as West Lethbridge's hub and would consist of two high schools, a branch of the Lethbridge Public Library, parks and fields for softball, soccer and other sports. Additionally, the cities first major leisure centre, the Crossings Leisure Complex, is being constructed. It will consist of two NHL style ice rinks, an Olympic class swimming pool, a waterpark with waterslides and wave pool, 12 curling rinks, an indoor track, and gym. The centre will be located in the new The Crossings subdivision. Transportation Transportation in West Lethbridge consists of a major road network. University Drive is currently the major arterial roadway in the area. It connects with Whoop-up Drive, the city's busiest roadway, and Crowsnest Trail, the city's connection to Calgary, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan. Several collector roads connect with University Drive. In 2006, University Drive was widened from Whoop-up Drive to the location of the proposed sports arena, making the roadway six lanes in areas, including multiple turning lanes onto access roads for the University of Lethbridge. Six bus routes operated by Lethbridge Transit service the Westside, with two of them offering connections to downtown, North Lethbridge and South Lethbridge. All routes converge at a transit terminal located at the university.

It is next to the River Avon, two miles upstream from Bristol Bridge. From the early 18th century it began to be used extensively as an industrial area. The Bristol Brass Company began copper smelting in 1810 at Crew's Hole, and later expanded with a chimney further uphill which gave a better draught condition for the furnaces. Anthony Ammatt established a pottery at Crew's Hole in 1812, using clay transported from the Isle of Wight and Poole. Several bargeworks were built here during the 19th century. A tar works site was established by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1843 at the bottom of Troopers Hill, known for its distinctive chimney. It provided creosote to be used as a preservative for railway sleepers and by 1863 had passed into the ownership of Brunel's manager, William Butler. At the turn of the 20th century, the works were used to manufacturer tarmac for roads, which became its main use. British Steel Corporation (BSC) took over running of the tar works in 1970. Under their ownership, it expanded to be one of the most modern in Europe, allowing a continuous 24/7 production of creosote, road tar and smokeless fuel, among other products. It continued to operate until 1981, by which time it had stopped producing road tar and become primarily a distillation unit. After closure, the works lay derelict for some years, until the area was redeveloped as Quayside Village in 1989. Because Crew's Hole is adjacent to the River Avon, the area has been prone to flooding. Significant floods were recorded in 1894, 1960 and 1968.

Meanwhile, Holly's fellow agents search for her. Security footage leaves Reacher as the prime suspect, and his mentor, Col. Leon Garber, is brought in to help, though he insists Reacher would never do such a thing. The Chicago office where Holly worked takes charge, with only agent in charge McGrath and two others, Milosevic and Brogan involved. At one point, they manage to put an APB out on the van, but get the wrong van due to a transfer of vehicles. After Reacher fails to takes advantage of an opportunity to escape during the night, Holly insists that he let her handle things. However, she ends up owing him when, during another stay, one of the kidnappers, Peter Bell, tries to rape her. Reacher breaks free of his restraints, kills Bell, hides his body, and re- restrains himself before the others become suspicious. Holly finally and reluctantly accepts his help after this. Reacher and Holly finally arrive at their destination; a mountain community that's home to a radical military sect wishing to secede from the US. Holly, intended by leader Beau Borken to be used as leverage to make her father agree to his demands, is placed in an upstairs room of an abandoned county courthouse, whose walls are supposedly filled with dynamite. She meets Jackson, an FBI agent working undercover, who offers to help her escape, but she refuses to leave without Reacher. Meanwhile, Reacher, after witnessing Borken execute Loder, the leader of the kidnappers, for multiple failures, is shown around the camp with the intent of sending him back to the States with information on the militia's credibility. However, word soon reaches Borken of Bell's murder, and Reacher is put on trial. Learning that he'll be executed, Holly escapes her room and convinces Borken to commute his sentence after he proves his worth in a shooting match. During the punishment, Reacher and Holly are forced to bury the caught Jackson's corpse, and Reacher suspects something big is about to happen. Meanwhile, the FBI figures out where the militia is. When the President, fearing political fallout from a bloodbath, refuses to authorize an attack, McGrath and his men go rogue, setting up camp near the community. That night, Reacher sneaks out of his cabin and into an abandoned mine, where he finds trucks carrying missiles. The next morning, as he returns to the camp, Reacher rescues McGrath, who was caught trying to break into the camp, proving his innocence. The two realize that Brogan and Milosevic are moles working for Borken for money. They stalk the camp to save Holly, killing Brogan in the process. Borken drags Holly out on national TV and tries to force her father to give in to his demands. With a sniper rifle stolen from the ammo cabin, Reacher shoots him dead. Milosevic takes Holly hostage, but Reacher and McGrath manage to kill him. As the FBI round up the remaining militia members and demolish the camp, Reacher discovers that Holly's cabin isn't actually filled with dynamite and realizes that Borken sent Stevie, the last kidnapper in a truck filled with it to San Francisco, where he plans to detonate in the middle of a crowd celebrating the Fourth of July. Everyone gets in a helicopter and Reacher manages to shoot and destroy the truck on time. Learning that Holly and McGrath are in a relationship, Reacher sadly says goodbye to her and is left to hitchhike down a highway.

This book primarily chronicles the Trumpet Judgements as foretold in the Book of Revelation. Other biblical prophecies from the Book of Revelation and the Book of Daniel are depicted. As with the first and third book in this trilogy, many footnotes are used from various sources. These sources include not only the bible, but also sources that were used as the author performed research and analysis to ensure scientific accuracy in the depiction of fictional events. Plot Birth of an Age starts after In His Image. The world is still grieving the loss caused by the China-India-Pakistan War. Christopher Goodman, the Alternate member of the United Nations Security Council for the European States assumes the Primary membership from Albert Moore who was responsible for the war. The United Nations sets out to provide aid to the survivors of the war. Two men, Saul Cohen and John the Apostle, leaders of a radical cult called the Koum Damar Patar (KDP), give prophecies of plagues. Only Christopher Goodman and his close advisors, Decker Hawthorne and Robert Milner acknowledge the prophecies. Plagues arrive and John and Cohen speaking prophecies about the plagues, quickly gain the world's attention. They become despised, being recognized as the harbingers of destruction, and they are blamed for the plagues. Three asteroids are discovered, one of which is on a collision course with Earth. The UN launches a series of nuclear missiles at the asteroid in order to deflect or destroy the asteroid. The other two asteroids shift trajectories to a collision course with Earth. The first asteroid passes through Earth's atmosphere almost parallel to the ground, but close enough to cause incredible amounts of damage due to the force of the shock wave it makes, creating damage from Northern Alaska, in a southeastern curve through Canada, the United States, Mexico, Central America, Columbia and Brazil. Its entrance and exit to and from the atmosphere siphons off a huge amount of ozone, which allows the ultraviolet rays from the sun to destroy crops and causes worldwide famine. The second asteroid directly collides with Earth, striking in the Philippine Basin of the Pacific Ocean and causing seismic upheaval. The asteroid's explosion on the sea floor sent iron dust throughout the Pacific Ocean, which quickly turned red with rust. The third asteroid is obliterated by the nuclear missiles launched by the UN. When the asteroid's dust reached earth, it contains a large amount of arsenic, which poisoned Earth's water supply creating a global outbreak of arsenic poisoning. Soon, locust-like creatures appear in massive swarms injecting people with a painful neurotoxin. After five months they die en masse. Christopher Goodman, the clone of Christ, discovers that he had the power of healing and soothes people who had been stung by the locust. He healed hundreds of people, including several members of the UN Security Council, and their families, as well as Decker Hawthorne. Christopher's supernatural powers make him popular, and he is nominated to the vacant seat of the Secretary General. During his acceptance speech, Christopher Goodman is assassinated by Decker's old friend Tom Donafin. After Goodman dies, a homicidal madness began spreads amongst the people near the mouth of the Euphrates River. Entire families, villages, cities, and nations are filled with rampaging citizens bent on killing each other. The madness destroys the middle East, southern Russia, much of Asia, eastern Africa, and south eastern Europe. Three days after Christopher's assassination, at his funeral, Robert Milner approached the coffin and laid his hands on it. Christopher Goodman is resurrected, the reincarnation of Christ. Christopher explained that as his body was dead, he gained the entire memory of Jesus Christ all the way up to the time of his death, and gained other knowledge as well. He explained that rather than being a god, Yahweh was the member of a species called Theatans. Four billion years ago, these Theatans were at the same evolutionary level as humans are now. Their evolutionary process had stagnated, until it was discovered that the next evolutionary step - the final step - was a voluntary step taken by the species as a whole. The people of Theata took this evolutionary step, and evolved into spiritual beings capable of wonders only dreamed of previously. Eventually, one Theatan discovered that there was one further evolutionary step, although it was a state that only a single being may achieve. This Theatan, named Yahweh, took this step, and became a Godhead. Christopher continues to explain that humans are now on the brink of the evolutionary step into the spirit as the Theatans, however, Yahweh does not wish to relinquish his hold on humanity, believing that if they evolve into spirits, they will be on equal footing with him, and will no longer serve him. In order to stave off this evolutionary cooperation by humankind, Yahweh has stricken the earth with the plagues of asteroids, locust and madness, and he plans more and worse plagues as time goes on. Decker and Milner resolve to do anything they can to help Christopher rally humanity against Yahweh and issue in the New Age of Humankind. Christopher, Milner and Decker travel to the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, Israel. Cohen and John are located. With a swipe of his hand Christopher sends them both flying toward the Temple at great speed, killing them on impact with the temple wall. Decker remains outside to talk to the press as Christopher and Milner enter the Temple with the intention of desecrating the altar inside, to put a stop to the animal sacrifices that take place there. Also Christopher takes the contents of the Ark of the Covenant and throws them from the roof of the Temple as he proclaims that he is the Second Coming of Christ, the Jewish Messiah, and Muhammad al-Mahdi among other prophesied figures throughout most other religions, saying they're all one and the same. As Christopher nears the conclusion of his address, light beings, presumably Theatans, surround the temple and flood the Temple Mount. Christopher leaps from the roof of the Temple, and is suspended in mid-air by the light beings and he proclaims that everyone should \\"Behold the Hosts of Heaven\\".

It is the only high school in the Rittman Exempted Village Schools district. They are nicknamed the \\"Indians\\", which comes from the old Rittman Chippewa Salt Company's (now known as Morton Salt Company) logo of a Native American's head. Red and white were the school colors until 1940 when black was added. Since the 2005-2006 school year, the eighth grade class has been included in the high school. A new high school was built and opened in 2011 on the same property as the previous building.http://www.rittman.k12.oh.us/hs Rittman's football rivalry with the Chippewa High School Chipps is the longest-running uninterrupted rivalry in Wayne County, having met every year since 1923. The football rivalry with the Dalton High School Bulldogs is also the fourth most- played rivalry in Wayne County as well. Sex Scandal In 2009, a female teacher at the school was involved in a nationally covered sex scandal and charged with sexual battery involving two male students, ages 17 and 18. In late 2008, the school received notice that the parents of the first student were suspicious of the contact between the teacher and student. The school was investigating internally to see if the claims were warranted. Then, in early 2009, the family of the second student contacted the school and filed a complaint that the student confirmed an inappropriate relationship was taking place. The same day, Erin Speicher, then 34, resigned from her position as a ninth-grade English teacher at Rittman High School. She taught at the school for 12 years. Speicher was arrested and was being held on a $75,000 cash bond at the Wayne County Jail. Speicher engaged in sexual conduct with one student in June 2008 and again sometime between August and October. She engaged in sexual conduct with a second student five times in January 2009, according to the indictment. She pleaded guilty to a seven-count indictment of sexual battery in Wayne County Common Pleas Court and was sentenced to four years in prison. Speicher, who was married (currently divorced) with two young children at the time, is quoted as saying to the court \\"As a result of my actions I will never teach again, and I love teaching. Last week I taught my 4-year-old and my 3-year-old the words, 'correctional facility,' to explain that is where I may have to live for a while. ... But I also kept thinking that if my sons were the victims in this case, I know I would want that teacher punished.\\" Speicher's attorney, Norman Miller, said she was remorseful for her actions, and had sought counseling. Upon release from prison, Speicher will be classified as a Tier 3 sex offender, which comes with a lifetime registry. http://www.times-gazette.com/local%20news/2009/08/27/former-teacher-gets-four- years-in-prison Community response After Speicher was sentenced, many supporters from the community thought she was sentenced harshly. Because of the second student being a legal adult and both students being over the age of consent in Ohio (16 years of age), they felt the four-year prison sentence was unjust and lengthy. Speicher was charged because of her position of power as an educational instructor, even though during the affairs, she was not either students teacher. Many believe that Speicher was simply used as an example to be set in the community. Further Scandal Involvement In 2013, the school was involved in a scandal surrounding the football team. While completing an assignment for his junior composition class, a Junior member of the varsity football team wrote a controversial poem about the favoritism and nepotism being displayed by the football team. In response to the poem, the coach, whose son is on the team, and is perceived to be benefiting from his father's position, took drastic measures, ensuring that the student was removed from the football team and convincing the principal to suspend the student from classes for four days. Although this is a clear violation of the student's First Amendment rights, the district did little to respond. The punishment garnered widespread media attention. Shortly after the increased media pressure, the district intervened and overturned the punishment.http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/24/us/high-school-football-player-poem- suspension/ It is unknown as to what type of reception the student will receive when he returns to his team, as the coach who brought on this unwarranted punishment has had no repercussions.

This book primarily chronicles the Bowl Judgements as foretold in the Book of Revelation, as well as the institution of the Mark of the Beast, and the growing persecution of the followers of God. Other biblical prophecies from the Book of Revelation and the Book of Daniel are depicted as well. As with the first and second book in this trilogy, many footnotes are used from various sources. These sources include not only the Bible, but also sources that were used as the author performed research and analysis to ensure scientific accuracy in the depiction of fictional events. Plot The book starts before the conclusion of Birth of an Age. Christopher's address from the top of the Temple in Jerusalem is revisited, concluding with Christopher leaping from the top of the temple, and caught by the visible Spirit beings, whom Christopher identified as Theatans on the flight to Jerusalem with Decker Hawthorne and Robert Milner. Christopher is an extremely popular Secretary General of the United Nations, who was nominated following his supernatural healing of various members of the Security Council, and elected unanimously prior to his assassination, and subsequent resurrection. Christopher reveals to the world that humanity is on the brink of its greatest evolutionary step, which people are now heralding as the New Age. However, given the nature of this evolutionary step - that of evolving into nearly omnipotent Spirit Beings - this step must be taken collectively by the entire species, rather than through natural selection of individual members of the human race. If any significant portion of the human population balks at taking this evolutionary step, the evolutionary process will be a failure, and humankind will lose the opportunity to evolve, and remain a stagnant species doomed for extinction. The greatest threat to humankind in taking this evolutionary step is represented by Fundamentalist Christians and various Jewish sects, including a group of 144,000 Jews which call themselves the Koum Damar Patar or KDP for short. These groups remained loyal to Yahweh, whom Christopher has identified as a power hungry Theatan, intent on keeping humankind as they are, in order to prevent them from becoming his equal. Christopher vows not to let this happen, and declares the New Age, starting with year 1. March 11, the day of Christopher's resurrection, is declared New Year's Day. Three days after Christopher's address at the Temple, the bodies of John and Saul Cohen are called into Heaven. This is captured on tape by the media, but is dismissed by Christopher as dramatics by Yahweh to frighten people away from their destinies. A life-size statue of Christopher is erected at the top of the Temple, and speakers are set to broadcast Christopher's Address to Humankind in a repeating loop. Here, Christopher also begins a revitalization plan for healing the Middle East, which was decimated in a recent plague of mass psychosis that affected every man woman and child in the region, which now sits bereft of humanity. The first priority in fixing this region is to rebuild the city of Babylon in Iraq. This site is chosen as a symbol of defiance toward Yahweh, since that was where humankind was first attacked by Yahweh when he afflicted them with tongues when they were erecting the Tower of Babel. He also indicated that he planned to move the United Nations main headquarters there, relocating from the Secretariat Building in New York City. Throughout the world, people start experiencing brief moments of supernatural power. These powers include the ability to control others' behavior, telepathy, precognition, rapid healing of fatal injuries, and very detailed memories of past lives. Most people's experiences are very brief, mostly linked to a single incident, however these episodes happen all over the world and begin to happen more frequently. Christopher attributes this phenomenon to the fact that people are inching ever closer to that evolutionary step which will bring humanity into its New Age. Christopher then reveals that he will help accelerate this process, by instituting a Communion. This Communion remains a closely guarded secret, only to be revealed when the time is right. The communion is said to give people immortality along with great power. Decker meets with Christopher to discuss this communion, and points out that giving immortality and power to the Christian Fundamentalists, KDP and the other Jews set against Christopher will be counter-productive. He suggests that the best way to keep Christopher's enemies away from the communion is use their own prophecies against them. If a mark is required to receive communion, as well as a pledge by individuals to aid Christopher and all of humankind by working toward the New Age, then Christians, Jews and the KDP will avoid taking the mark, and lack the powers, and immortality to continue their subversive behavior against Humankind. Christopher decides to show Decker the Communion. As they walk, Christopher reminds Decker that Christopher's foster father, Harry Goodman, had developed so-called C-Cells after the discovery of Jesus's blood on the Shroud of Turin. He also reminds Decker of Robert Milner's advanced age, yet remarkable health, due to a blood transfusion with Christopher years before. Decker correctly concludes that the Communion must consist of the distribution of Christopher's blood among the population. Christopher confirms this, and indicates that for the last two years, scientists and technicians have been frantically cloning Christopher's blood, and putting it in medicinal capsules. They enter a huge warehouse that was stocked floor to ceiling, wall-to-wall with Christopher's blood. The mark of communion was a depiction of the numerals 666, since Christopher's name added up to that value in the Hebrew alphabet, and the intent was to keep Christians and other religious fundamentalists away. As the day drew closer to opening up the clinics to the public, these clinics became the targets for Christian protesters. These protests grew more violent and when the doors were finally opened, the clinics became the targets of terrorist attacks, apparently by Fundamentalists trying to prevent people from taking the communion. Public clamor for the capture and punishment of these terrorists grew until Christopher was forced to take stronger actions. Capital punishment was extended to Christian terrorists, and their fundamentalist leaders. Other than zealots and terrorists, Christians mostly avoided the clinics. Decker also avoided taking the mark. When confronted by Christopher, in his office in Babylon, Decker, now 72 years old, indicated that he didn't want to live forever. He still missed his family who died in The Disaster years before, and although he was in no hurry to die, he would welcome the rest when it came. Christopher pointed out that Decker, who had been writing speeches for Christopher, and had been promoting New Age principles and philosophies, must have forgotten that all that applied to him as well! His wife and daughters had reincarnated immediately after their deaths, and Decker would not be old and tired after the Communion, and he could go to them and reunite his family. Decker, very excited by this prospect, immediately headed out, and was on his way to the nearest clinic when he was abducted by the KDP. The KDP took Decker to Petra, Jordan where he stayed in a one-room building. He was confronted by Scott Rosen, the son of Decker's late close friends Joshua and Ilana Rosen. Scott was revealed to be a member of the KDP and was instructed by God to attempt to convert him. After a violent outburst by Decker, which resulted in a shining black eye for Scott, Decker grew calm and attempted to not listen to Scott. Scott presented very convincing arguments about the existence of God, the accuracy of the Bible, and the messages it contained, and how Christopher was a huge liar and the personification of evil. Decker, unimpressed, said nothing and refused to react to anything Rosen said. Rosen presented Decker with a Bible which belonged to Decker's late wife, Elizabeth, complete with her handwriting and notes. After another session with Rosen, Decker continuing to refuse to give Rosen the satisfication of knowing that some of what he said got through, Rosen released Decker from captivity, promising him a ride to Israel after their observance of Shabbat. That evening, walking around Petra, Decker met Rhoda Donafin, the widow of Decker's closest friend Tom Donafin, as well as his sons, Tom, Jr., and Decker Donafin (this was the first Decker knew that Tom named one of his children after him, and it affected him greatly). Decker met several people around Petra, and realized that none of the people he met were anything like the overzealous, wild-eyed fundamentalists that he saw on TV, or read about in the papers. These people were caring, friendly and scared. When Rhoda indicated to Decker that they were to be attacked by Christopher and the armies of the world, even offering Decker a timeframe for when this was to occur. Decker promised that was not the case, and if it were, he would talk sense to Christopher, and maybe they could all become friends - or at the least allies - in the evolution of Humankind. Rhoda reacted with an amused dismissal of Decker's promise, however the two remained friendly even if they disagreed on this. Decker ate with the Donafins, and treated them to stories of their father when he and Decker used to share adventures and misadventures when they were younger. After Shabbat, Decker was provided a ride, as promised, to Israel, where he caught a plane back to his home in Maryland where he planned to rest for a few days. On his way home, he noticed that everyone bearing Christopher's mark was also bearing bandages that covered up painful sores and blisters. Decker decided to hold off on the Communion for a bit. This first plague of sores caused outrage among Humankind who demanded that Christopher retaliate against Yahweh. The United Nations instituted penalties for sedition and collusion with Yahweh. Leaders of Fundamentalists groups were subject to capital punishment. The rationale was that although capital punishment was distasteful for many, removal of the opposing force was necessary to Humankind's evolutionary journey, and furthermore, individuals would be reincarnated free of their past prejudices and philosophies, and will join everyone else in the procession into the New Age. During Decker's vacation, the next plague began with the transformation of all the oceans of the earth to blood. The world watched horrified as all aquatic life, and anyone in boats during the transition from water to blood were killed. After a couple of days people in coastal areas grew sick from the decay and stench of the rotting blood, and the surface of the oceans were scabbing over. People were outraged and grew extremely angry toward Yahweh whom Christopher pointed out was responsible for this plague. A week after the plague began, Robert Milner walked out to a bloody coastline and threw a charged quartz crystal that landed on the scab, liquefying it, and turning the liquid back into water. The water began to replace blood in a spreading radius, and after a day, all the oceans were once again water, although, they remained void of life. The United Nations increased the penalties for sedition and collusion with Yahweh again, this time banning followers of Yahweh from engaging in commerce or owning property. It was made illegal to buy anything from or sell anything to anyone not bearing the mark of Communion. Properties owned by those not bearing the mark were confiscated by the government, and residents not bearing the mark, evicted. Capital punishment was extended toward anyone showing an active role in the subversive behavior against Humankind and the New Age. Decker, by virtue of his position within the United Nations, and by virtue of very few people knowing where he was, remained undisturbed in his home in Maryland. Policemen issuing eviction notices bypassed Decker's home believing that there's no way that Decker Hawthorne - THE Decker Hawthorne - would not have received the Communion, especially when record-keeping errors were not uncommon. The week following Milner's cleansing of the oceans, all the bodies of fresh water turned to blood. Decker took stock of all the drinkable liquid in his house, and hoarded as much as possible. Decker watched on TV the various horrors that came from this plague. People dying of dehydration, people killing each other for groceries that had liquid (even cans of corn and peas were precious for the water inside), riots and looting. A week after the plague started, Robert Milner walked into a bloody river, and cut his own arm, mingling his own running blood with the blood of the water. The water turned clear and pure. Nearby observers made their exhausted way to the water to quench their thirst. Within a day all the fresh water of the world was cleansed. In reaction to the anger to this plague, the United Nations again increased the penalties for sedition and collusion with Yahweh, this time extending capital punishment toward anyone refusing to take the mark. Rewards were offered for turning in those not bearing the mark. Decker, who knew what was going on, read his wife's Bible to determine what would happen next. Decker called his property manager, Bert Tollinson, and had him reinforce a room in his house with insulation and air- conditioning units, and got lots of ice. He warned Bert that extreme heat was coming, and he should do the same for his home so his family wouldn't suffer. Bert took Decker's advice. By midweek the extreme heat was taking its toll. People died in the heat. In Antarctica settlements fell under the ice, and avalanches were common in mountainous regions. The power stations around Decker's home failed, and Decker eventually collapsed and was unable to move. Fortunately Decker's home had been so cold before and well insulated he managed to survive. After a week of the heatwave, Milner arrived in Machu Picchu and made a plea to the sun-god to relent. From where Milner stood, a cool breeze issued forth, and within a day, the heat was back to normal. With normal temperatures restored, Decker soon recovered. The frequency of executions accelerated in retaliation to this latest plague. So-called \\"Execution Centers\\" were established to systematically murder those without a mark. As many as 20,000 people a day were killed in a single Execution Center. At first, only religious leaders and celebrities were televised during their executions. As the anger among humanity grew, so did their demand for televised executions, until some stations began to show executions 24 hours a day. A week after the heat subsided, a dark murky substance engulfed the entire planet, with the exception of Petra and Christopher's office in Babylon. Everywhere else was consumed by the darkness. Anyone in contact with the darkness (which was almost everyone on the planet) experienced terrifying hallucinations and horrifying visions. Sufferers were incapacitated with fear. This plague only lasted 3 days. After this plague Decker discovered that Christopher's approval rating had dropped from 95% to 11% as a result of the plagues. Decker felt guilty because it was his job to deal with the media and he had been home the whole time rather than doing his job. In a televised address later that week, Decker watched as Christopher promised that there would be no more plagues and that humankind would receive three signs that their step toward the New Age was nearly complete. Sores would disappear, and telepathic and telekinetic powers would be acquired by everyone who wore the mark, permanently. Finally, Christopher promised that the last remaining vestige of Yahweh's followers were trapped in Petra, and they would all be destroyed. Decker, horrified, decided to return to Babylon and talk Christopher out of destroying Petra. Since Decker did not bear the mark, he had to get Bert Tollinson to arrange his passage to the United Nations building in Babylon. Decker arrived at Christopher's office and immediately began arguing for sparing the people of Petra. When Christopher refused to talk about the issue, Decker decided that everything that the Jews, Fundamentalists and the KDP had been saying about Christopher was true. Christopher finally showed his true self to Decker, admitting that he was the Antichrist and his only desire was to acquire as many believers that he could, and kill anyone who opposed him. Christopher elaborated that he took pleasure in \\"mak[ing] the Creator of the Universe weep\\". Decker, defeated, realized he, too, was responsible for all Christopher's campaign of death and mayhem. He told Christopher that when he and Decker were both in hell, Decker would be the one on his knees thanking God for giving him what he deserved. At that point Christopher went into an insane fury and murdered Decker - but not before Decker apologized to Jesus for what he had done, and was forgiven, denying Christopher Decker's soul. Shortly after, the plague of sores that afflicted anyone bearing Christopher's mark vanished. Followers also gained the strength, health and vitality of youth as well as the fantastic powers of telepathy and telekinesis that Christopher had promised them. All of Christopher's promises came true, and his popularity again surged. He planned for a march on Petra and invited every human on Earth to join him. They would use their new powers to tear down the city walls; killing the last non- believers and completing their transcendence. The Jews within Petra finally joined with the Christians in Petra as one people, when they had been reluctant allies previously. Several rescue missions were sent into Babylon and Jerusalem to find any remaining Christians and transport them to Petra. Some of those bearing Christopher's Mark tried to gain forgiveness from God by amputating their hand, the only way to remove the mark completely. For those desperate enough to do so, the self-mutilation was justified by scripture: citing , \\"If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off\\". As the people of the world gathered in Tel Megiddo in the northern Jezreel Valley, Babylon was destroyed by an immense earthquake and vehicle-sized hail stones. Christopher placated those effected by promising to resurrect Babylon - along with everyone and everything that had been destroyed in it - once Petra had been razed. As Christopher issued the call to begin the invasion of Petra, Jesus Christ appeared on the top of a nearby mountain. Christopher met him there, and offered to allow Jesus to join mankind against the forces of Yahweh. For a moment all of Christopher's followers thought they may be watching an historic alliance being formed. Christopher's offer was met with silence. After this rejection Christopher began to brag to Jesus about how all these hundreds of millions of people rejected Jesus in favor of Christopher, boasting that \\"those you wanted as your bride have become my whores and sluts\\". The sudden realization of Christopher's cynicism lead to panic. Jesus forced Christopher and Robert Milner into a fiery chasm. Christopher's army collapsed upon itself and quickly decomposed as individuals vainly struggled to escape. The epilogue features Decker's reunion with his wife and children, his brother Nate, and the Donafins, including Tom, as well as many friends and acquaintances from throughout his life. Decker also met Jesus Christ who told Decker that all was forgiven, and he was glad Decker had finally accepted Him, even if it was during Decker's final moments of life. Tom and Elizabeth explained to Decker what happened between his death and his resurrection. While Decker mourned those who had not been able to join them in this Kingdom, but mostly rejoiced that he had his wife and daughter's back.

In Spain it is also known as Se√±ora Beba. It was executive produced by Aqua Films' Ver√≥nica Cura. It stars Norma Aleandro, Norma Argentina and Marcos Mundstock. The story is set in Buenos Aires before and during Argentina's 2001 economic crisis, and depicts the transformation of Argentinian society through the lives and relationship of two very different women: Beba, a spoiled, temperamental member of the Argentina upper middle class (Aleandro), and her longtime maid, Dora (Argentina) both in their 50s. Plot Beba used to be a well-to-do socialite but Argentina's rising economic crisis between 1998 and 2002 has left her with almost nothing. She is then forced to sell beauty products door-to-door. On the other hand, Dora came to Buenos Aires during her teenage years from the Chaco Province to work as a full-time maid at Beba's apartment. Since then she has slowly worked to build a house in one of the towns outside Buenos Aires. Dora, however, is unable to complete the construction of her house because Beba owes her six months pay. Dora, tired of listening to Beba's promises of payment, is now determined to resign. Beba asks her for more time to get the money together and Dora accepts. During this period Beba tries to use the confidence of Dora and discourages her from venturing into a new phase of her life. Finally, Dora leaves the apartment to live with Miguel, her boyfriend, at her new home. Meanwhile, at Beba's apartment, the power and telephone services are cut due to lack of payment. Dora visits a lonely and disheveled Beba in her now unkempt home on her birthday. Much to Beba's disappointment, Dora must leave after only a short while, explaining that she is awaiting a call from an employment agency. Beba gives Dora her letter of recommendation. When summer arrives Beba is forced to rent out her apartment and move to a smaller place. She goes in a moving truck to Dora's house, with the intention of giving her much of her furniture. Dora invites Beba to stay the night in her house. It is then clear that Beba will live with Dora in the latter's house.

Critic Eric Snider like the acting in the film, and wrote, \\"Where it excels is in its casting: Norma Aleandro and Norma Argentina are absolutely perfect, both separately and as a team. Aleandro, an Argentine film veteran, has the look of a woman who wants to be imperious but can no longer afford it, the face of someone trying to keep her dignity.

Frank, starring Ed Asner as Frank Bass, a wrestling promoter. Verne Gagne also stars in the film as Mike Bullard, the current wrestling champion of his \\"league\\". After a long reign as champion, Bullard is getting older and feeling pressure from all sides, including his wife and wrestling promoters, to pass the championship to Billy Taylor and retire. Bullard's resistance to their requests that he step aside is the central conflict in the film. The film presents professional wrestling as a truly competitive sport, always maintaining the illusion that matches are a result of athletic combat and not pre-determined outcomes decided before the matches. At one point during the film, a number of wrestlers who had either died during a match or as a result of in-ring injuries are mentioned. That list of names was not fictional, but taken from the history of professional wrestling. Plot Professional wrestling promoter Frank Bass (Ed Asner) has to deal with the pressures of running a professional wrestling promotion, facing the pressures of constantly finding new wrestlers to pull in the crowds, keeping the wrestlers he has under contract under control and especially dealing with the fact that the top man, the champion of \\"the League\\" Mike Bullard (Verne Gagne) is getting old and there is pressure to replace him with a younger wrestler. One such possible replacement is the latest challenger Billy Taylor (Billy Robinson). At one point, Bass meets with a number of other wrestling promoters (played by real life wrestling promoters from the National Wrestling Alliance, including Vincent J. McMahon) to possibly create a \\"Super Bowl of Wrestling\\". Facing pressure, Frank Bass decides to back Bullard as he faces the challenger Billy Taylor in the climax of the movie. Cast The film features a number of actual wrestlers in the role of the various wrestlers throughout the movie, most of them worked for Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association at the time The Wrestler was filmed. The Wrestler also mixed in footage from actual wrestling shows, creating the setting for the film while not being important to the actual plot of the film.

It is considered the worst flood in the city's history since 1557. With the combined effort of Italian and foreign volunteers alike, or angeli del fango (\\"Mud Angels\\"), many of these fine works have been restored. New methods in conservation were devised and restoration laboratories established. However, even decades later, much work remains to be done.  Overview  Located in the Tuscany region of Central Italy, the Arno river is approximately long. It flows from the Mount Falterona hills of the Apennine Mountains to the Ligurian Sea, just west of Pisa. Lush vineyards and olive groves line the river's scenic course to the west, out to sea. Principally utilized for irrigation purposes, only of the river is used for navigation. The highest flows of the river generally occur in spring and autumn of every year, when rainfall in the Apennines is at its greatest. The intensity of the 1966 flood was further increased by both the orography of the Apennines, which contributed to the high run-off rates and river discharges, and urban development. Roads, such as the Via de Calzaiuoli, served as narrow channels for floodwaters, allowing for their greater speed and destruction within the city; bridges, on the other hand, hindered river flow where it was needed, allowing water to pour over the floodplain with great force.

At this point the marker is about high. 3 November * After a long period of steady rain, the Levane and La Penna dams in Valdarno began to discharge more than of water per second toward Florence. * At 14:30, the Civil Engineering Department reported \\"'an exceptional quantity of water.'\\" * Cellars in the Santa Croce and San Frediano areas began to flood. * Police received calls for assistance from villagers up the Arno Valley. * The flood's first victim, a 52-year-old worker, died at the Anconella water treatment plant. 4 November 1966 * At 04:00, engineers, fearing that the Valdarno dam would burst, discharged a mass of water that eventually reached the outskirts of Florence at a rate of . * At 07:26, the Lungarno delle Grazie cut off gas, electricity and water supplies to affected areas. * By 08:00, army barracks were flooded. * By 09:00, hospital emergency generators (the only source of electrical power remaining) failed. * Landslides obstructed roads leading to Florence, while narrow streets within city limits funneled floodwaters, increasing their height and velocity. * By 09:45, the Piazza del Duomo was flooded. * The powerful waters ruptured central heating oil tanks, and the oil mixed with the water and mud, causing greater damage. * Florence was divided in two, and officials were unable to immediately reach citizens of the city past the Piazza Michelangelo. * At its highest, the water reached over in the Santa Croce area. * By 20:00, the water began to lower.  Impact  The flood has had a lasting impact on Florence, economically and culturally. City officials and citizens were unprepared for the storm and the widespread devastation that it caused. There were virtually no emergency measures in place, at least partially because Florence is located in an area where the frequency of flooding is relatively low. In fact, approximately 90% of the city's population were completely unaware of the imminent disaster. Residents were set to celebrate their country's World War I victory over Austria on 4 November, Armed Forces Day. In commemoration, businesses were closed and many of their employees were out of town for the public holiday. While many lives were likely spared as a result, the locked buildings greatly inhibited the salvaging of valuable materials from numerous institutions and shops, with the exception of a number of jewellery stores whose owners were warned by their nightwatchmen. 5,000 families were left homeless by the storm, and 6,000 stores were forced out of business. Approximately 600,000 tons of mud, rubble and sewage severely damaged or destroyed numerous collections of books, manuscripts and fine art. In fact, it is estimated that between 3 and 4 million books and manuscripts were damaged, as well as 14,000 movable works of art. Artist Marco Sassone, in a 1969 interview, recalled the impact of the flood on Florence's residents: \\"The only thing you could do was watch and be helpless. Nature was master...the women became crazy with fear. They began throwing things from the windows and screaming 'who is going to save my children?'\\" It was reported that 101 people lost their lives in the flood waters.Barton, Phyllis.

The Register, Sunday 2 November 1969, p 10 Collections affected Manuscripts from the National Library being washed and dried in the boiler room of Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station, after the flood * Archives of the Opera del Duomo (Archivio di Opera del Duomo): 6,000 volumes of documents and 55 illuminated manuscripts were damaged. * Gabinetto Vieusseux Library (Biblioteca del Gabinetto Vieusseux): All 250,000 volumes were damaged, including titles of romantic literature and Risorgimento history; submerged in water, they became swollen and distorted. Pages, separated from their text blocks, were found pressed upon the walls and ceiling of the building. * National Central Library (Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Firenze): Located alongside the Arno, the National Library was cut off from the rest of the city by the flood. 1,300,000 items (a third of their holdings) were damaged, including prints, maps, posters, newspapers and a majority of works in the Palatine and Magliabechi collections. * The State Archives (Archivio di Stato): Roughly 40% of the collection was damaged, including property and financial records; birth, marriage and death records; judicial and administrative documents; and police records, among others. Others: * Academy of Agriculturists (Accademia dei Georgofili) * Historic Institute of the Resistance (Istituto Storico della Resistenza) * Hospital of the Innocents (Ospedale degli Innocenti) * Institute and Museum of the History of Science (Istituto e Museo di Storia della Scienza) * Uffizi Gallery * Book shops and antique book dealers, many in possession of rare materials * Numerous private collections * The collections of numerous churches and cathedrals Works affected * Crucifix by Giovanni Cimabue * Gates of Paradise by Lorenzo Ghiberti * Magdalene Penitent by Donatello  Funding and assistance  Realizing the immense wealth and importance of Florentine culture in a global context, many individuals and organizations contributed to the conservation mission, providing both funding and manpower. Art historian and professor Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti assembled a committee with Mayor Piero Bargellini as chairman to raise awareness of the needs of Florence's art and academic institutions. Members included prominent figures from around the world, representatives of their own respective institutions. A number of other international committees were formed with the intention of sponsoring various institutions in Florence: * The Franco-Italian Committee aided the Church of Santa Maria Maddalena di Pazzi in Borgo Pinti. * The U.S. Committee to Rescue Italian Art, composed of 25 sub-committees and chaired by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, assisted in restoring frescoes around the city. * The Viennese armory was responsible for restoring the arms and armor of the Bargello Museum. * A Dutch committee sponsored the Buonarroti House Museum. * A group of Germans repaired the musical instruments of the Bardini Museum. The work of and contributions made by these committees were supervised by a central committee in Rome. Additional funding came from various governments, UNESCO, and the International Committee for the Assistance of Museums, Works of Art, Libraries and Archives, among others. The city of Edinburgh (Scotland), twinned with Florence, sent practical help for the citizens in the form of double-decker buses to temporarily replace those which had been lost in the floods. When these eventually returned home, they operated with the international 'GB' registration plate still affixed to the rear; each also carried a small plaque presented by the Florentine transport authorities indicating their gratitude for the gesture made by the people of Edinburgh. Charity auctions were also organised. In a show of support for the Florentine art community, Pablo Picasso had one of his paintings, Recumbent Woman Reading, auctioned off on an internationally televised programme. He donated the $105,000 it earned to restoration efforts in Italy. Similarly, Pietro Annigoni and Luciano Guarnieri donated the money they earned from selling 575 colour lithographs (depicting the events surrounding the flood and its aftermath), produced from 13 of their drawings. Florentine native Franco Zeffirelli produced the short documentary Florence: Days of Destruction to raise awareness of the flood. Released a month after the disaster, it reputedly raised more than $20 million for reconstruction efforts. The film was narrated in English and Italian by actor Richard Burton. While many institutions from around the world financially compensated employees who travelled to Italy and aided in the restoration of Florence, many others volunteered their services for absolutely no pay. Collectively, these people have been fondly referred to as \\"Mud Angels\\", due to their commitment to working in such deplorable conditions. The \\"Mud Angels\\" Mario Primicerio, the mayor of Florence from 1995 to 1999, helped celebrate the Mud Angels' (angeli del fango) efforts during an anniversary celebration in 1996. Thirty years earlier, he was a professor who lent his assistance in preserving the priceless artifacts of Florence. The Angels cleaned the city of refuse, mud and oil, and retrieved works of art, books and other materials from flooded rooms; experts from around the world volunteered their time and knowledge in the conservation of the aforementioned materials. In a 1996 interview, Primicerio offered three principal reasons as to why the Mud Angels felt compelled to help: a concern for future generations, a feeling of international unity and a pervasive sense of solidarity. The \\"Flood Ladies\\" The Flood Ladies were a group of international female artists who contributed artworks to the city of Florence following the catastrophic 1966 flood of the Arno as a sign of solidarity and to help repair the psychological damage done by the flood. The group was formed in Florence, Italy in 1966. Contributors to the collection lived all over the world. In 2014 the organization Advancing Women Artists Foundation headed an effort to preserve, exhibit and acknowledge the contribution of these women.  Conservation measures  Many experts in the field of conservation, such as Peter Waters, utilised their knowledge in restoring the works of art and literature ravaged by the flood. Staff from the Central Institute of Restoration and Institute of Book Pathology, for example, volunteered their time, efforts, and expertise in this enormous undertaking. New concepts, such as \\"phased conservation\\", and methods in conservation, such as mass deacidification, were conceived during this period after the flood ravaged the city of Florence. Books and records Priorities were established during the process of conserving damaged books and records, the most critical of which became the retrieval of materials from flooded rooms. After they were rescued, books and records were typically washed and disinfected. In certain cases, bindings were cut and sheets treated individually. Following a thorough cleansing, the materials were then dried in Florentine libraries, space permitting, or at locations outside of the city, such as tobacco kilns and granaries. In some circumstances, large numbers of books were covered with sawdust, as a means of drawing out moisture. When not washed prior to drying, dried mud was then scraped off the exterior of the books. One or both of two drying techniques was applied: interleaving by hand and/or drying with the aid of domestic heaters or other mechanical equipment. Interleaving involved the placement of blotting papers within the text-block of a book and replacing them once they were fully soaked; a variety of papers were used, including mimeograph paper and green blotting paper (the latter of which ultimately caused more damage). In kilns, the humidity level was slowly lowered from ninety to forty percent. If deemed necessary, bindings were removed and dried separately. Removed pages were hung out to dry on an apparatus similar to a clothes line. Fearing the spread of mold, workers completed these tasks with the greatest speed possible. After they were disinfected and dried, the items were then reassembled, restored and, if necessary, rebound. Card catalogs and in some cases, the actual books and documents were reproduced by reprinting on early presses, photocopying, or copying by hand. =The National Library Centers of Florence: a case study= Initially the transportation of large numbers of books to other institutes (to repair and rebind) was considered, but decided against on logistical grounds. Within six months of the flood, the National Library of Florence had 144 workers on hand: three binders, eight binder trainees, two librarians, forty-two workmen, eighty-one student volunteers and eight other library staff members. Together they devised a logical and efficient method of book repair, involving nine separate and clearly defined steps: * Books were selected for treatment. The details of work to be done were recorded on a formatted card that accompanied its respective book throughout its treatment. Once work was completed, the card was permanently filed. A universal language utilising symbols, created with foreign workers in mind, was employed in the formatting of this card. Symbols were assigned to key phrases that communicated the condition of each book and how its repair was to be conducted, such as: ** historically important ‚Äì only to be dealt with by experts ** incomplete ** medium mud ** rebind ** collation part missing * The book was photographed. * The book's collation was verified and its covers removed and stored in a marked case (if they were to be used in a new binding). * If necessary, the book was carefully taken apart to wash it in warm water and disinfect it with Topane (pentachlorophenol). * In certain cases, the leaves of the book were deacidified and buffered. * The text-block was pressed. * The text-block was dried in specially designed cabinets. * Sections of the book were then reconstructed and the text-blocks collated. * Finally, each book was wrapped in a paper sheet that had been impregnated with an antimicrobial substance, then they were set aside for any later repair or rebinding. The binding was completed in the main reading room of the library, which had been converted (temporarily) for this purpose. This methodical nine- part system enabled workers to process between seventy and a hundred books a day. After the Florence flood, the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale was not allowed to put books back into the lower levels.Lenzuni, Anna. \\"Coping with Disaster\\". Preservation of library materials: conference held at the National Library of Austria, Vienna, 7‚Äì10 April 1986. Ed. Merrily A. Smith. IFLA publications, 40‚Äì41. M√ºnchen: Saur, 1987. Paintings Many panel paintings were critically damaged as a result of water saturating their wood, causing the glue and gesso, which compose the priming layer, to dissolve. Consequently, the paintings' colours dissolved as well. In addition, the moisture caused paintings to buckle and crack or develop blisters, and the paint to chip and fall. Actions were taken to stabilize the problem by applying rice paper to the affected paintings and storing them in cool, stable environments where humidity was slowly decreased. In extreme cases, the paint layer was extracted from the wood and gesso and then reapplied to a new support. Nystatin, an antifungal, was sprayed on the wood to prevent mold from growing. Treatment facilities were established at locations such as the Boboli Garden Lemon-House, where over two hundred of these panel paintings were restored. Similar measures were necessary to conserve canvas paintings. First, an original canvas was relined and gauze applied to the painted surface, which was then ironed. This process is referred to as the rintelatura, or \\"new canvas\\" method. Relatively minor surface work was often completed with a variety of solvents and/or types of resin. Frescoes Frescoes demanded more complicated treatment. Normally water, once it evaporates, will leave a layer of residual salt on the surface of the wall that absorbed it. In some instances, the resultant efflorescence obscured painted images. In other cases, the impermeability of the fresco plaster caused the salt to become trapped beneath the surface, causing bubbles to form and erupt, and the paint to fall. The adhesion of the plaster to the wall was often also seriously compromised. A fresco could only be detached when fully dry. To dry a fresco, workers cut narrow tunnels beneath it, in which heaters were placed to draw out moisture from below (instead of outwards, which would have further damaged the paintings). Within a few days, the fresco was ready to be detached. Fuel oil, which coated many painted works of art, was removed by using Japanese tissue paper to apply a solvent, which dissolved the tar. An absorbent, such as talcum powder, was then distributed on the tissue paper. Sculpture and other objects It became imperative to clean sculpture immediately, before it fully absorbed the oil. Flaking sculpture was sprayed with a silicate mixture, while wooden pieces were treated with insecticides and toxic gases to kill insects and prevent future infestation. Weaponry, like firearms and swords, were taken apart, cleaned with paraffin, and finally lubricated to prevent future rusting. Bronze objects were kept in dehumidification chambers for a few weeks and cleaned with distilled water or polished. For more severely damaged pieces, experts completed \\"depth cleaning\\", which entailed the use of small drills and vacuuming. Similar measures were taken with gold. Broken objects were reassembled using photographs and other retrieved documentation. Effect on preservation and conservation awareness The disastrous results of the flood established an international awareness of the need for preservation and conservation education and facilities. In the United States, for example, it is no coincidence that the National Historic Preservation Act was passed in 1966. During the next twenty years: Work outstanding A significant amount of restorative work remains to be done in Florence. Due to a lack of awareness, funding, and manpower, a great number of works of art and books lie in storage, dirty and damaged. Christopher Clarkson, noted conservator, called attention to this problem in a 2007 letter, stating that the National Library still has a \\"warehouse\\" full of books to be repaired and bound; many others need cleaning or reassembling. According to a 1993 report, approximately 25% of the 80,000 items belonging to the Magliabecchi and Palatino collections had not been fully restored in the nearly thirty years since the flood. The number of conservators that work at the library presently is only about a tenth of the amount that worked there immediately after the flood. Environmental measures Regional officials in Tuscany are responsible for organizing a massive project, the purpose of which is to not only protect the area from future flooding but to maintain high water quality and effectively utilize water resources. Work commenced in 1984, with the construction of the Bilancino Dam, near Florence. The Sieve tributary and spillway at Pontedera are among other developments. The national government has funded a majority of these various subprojects, with the city of Florence being the primary recipient of the money.

Barnard is often referred to as Frank Barnard, as was his father Francis Jones Barnard, who as the founder of Barnard's Express, was one of BC's more notable pioneer entrepreneurs. Early life Stillman was born on May 16, 1856, in Toronto, Ontario. In 1860, he moved with his mother to Victoria, BC, where his father had preceded them by a year. There, he attended the Collegiate School from 1866 to 1870 after which, he was sent to Hellmuth College in London, Ontario, to continue his education. In 1873, he returned to British Columbia where he assisted his father in the operation of the family business, the B.C. Express Company a.k.a. Barnard's Express. In 1880, he was appointed as manager of the company when his father's health turned for the worse. He continued in this position until 1888, when he resigned to successfully run for the Cariboo seat in the House of Commons. Politically, he was a \\"liberal conservative\\", as Stillman was an ardent supporter of John A. Macdonald, with whom he campaigned and worked actively for the rapid settlement and development of the province. Accomplishments In addition to his primary role in the B.X. Express, Barnard was president and majority shareholder of Victoria Transfer Co. Ltd. and its counterpart, the Vancouver Transfer Co. Ltd. He was director and secretary of the Vancouver Improvement Company, and also a director of the Hastings Sawmill Company, the British Columbia Milling and Mining Company, and of the Selkirk Mining and Smelting Company. He was also a Victoria City Councillor in 1886 and 1887. He was a member of the Union Club in Victoria, and of the Rideau Club in Ottawa. From 1914 to 1919, he was the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia. He was knighted in 1919 by Edward, Prince of Wales. Personal life In 1883 he married Martha Amelia Sophia Loewen, (1866‚Äì1942) whose father was prominent in the flour & distillery business.

Additionally, ingestion of soaps and detergents can have potentially serious health consequences, and people using this form of punishment may face legal sanctions. History One of the earliest recorded uses of forcing another to ingest soap as punishment appeared in the 1832 Legal Examiner, in which it was noted that a married couple \\"were constantly quarrelling ; and that one evening, on the man's return home, he found his wife intoxicated, [...] perceiving a piece of kitchen soap lying on the ground near the spot, he crammed it into his wife's mouth, saying, \\"She has had plenty of water to wash with, she ought now to have a little soap\\".The Legal examiner: Volume 1 - Page 508.

Nonetheless, many people employ the aforementioned techniques with extremely limited knowledge regarding the safety of ingesting their chosen cleansing agents. Agents likely to cause serious harm if swallowed include many automatic dishwasher detergents and laundry detergents. Even ordinary bar soaps and liquid hand soaps may cause harmful effects including vomiting, diarrhea, irritation of the lining of the mouth and digestive tract, and in rare instances, pulmonary aspiration. This is especially true if these products are ingested in large quantities.

The movement was characterised by feelings of disgust and sickness towards the society of the time, artists used a crude humor to express their emotions and strongly believed in the superiority of human creativity over the logic and natural world. This revolution of resistance represented the transition between romanticism and modernism as it tried to recover the traditional elements of medieval Europe in the face of a more industrialised one. \\"After an initial period, aestheticism slowly degenerated into what, between 1880 and 1890, was better known as Decadentism and after 1890, in France, it was replaced by the term 'Symbolism‚ÄôF√©licien Rops, Pornokrat√®s, 1878 A Decadent Girl, by Ram√≥n Casas, 1899  European representatives  By the end of the 19th century between 1894 and 1897 the decadents had an iconic publication where everyone who joined the movement wanted to publish, its name was \\"The Yellow Book\\"; it was fundamental in defining the decadent art and literature. It was considered an innovative magazine for its time, since having decadent writers the content was very controversial in all its forms. \\"The Yellow Book\\" became the defining object of everything that characterised the yellow nineties, from aestheticism and decadence to the emergence of the 'little magazine' to new notions of gender and sexuality\\". Charles Baudelaire is considered the father of Decadentism; all the poets and writers who follow the work of the latter are considered decadent. Baudelaire discovered the correspondence between perfumes, sounds and colours and the dark and deep unity of nature, which responds to a particular feeling when the knowledge of the human soul has exhausted all its possibilities of understanding its existence and its strange deviations, such as the feminine homosexualism present in the European bourgeoisie. Baudelaire was handled between two tendencies, the Parnassians one as a tribute to perfection and a continuous desire to create a poetry that was capable of imposing itself and dominating the existing chaos, and a poetry that deepened its existential roots that served as inspiration for hundreds of decadent writers. His collection of poems, The Flowers of Evil, is his most renowned work. Baudelaire 1844 Another person to whom the paternity of the decadence is attributed is Th√©ophile Gautier, who, in 1868, in the preface of the book of poems \\"Flowers of Evil\\" by Baudelaire, spoke of a style in decline to which art comes when civilisation's age reaches a point of extreme maturity In France, decadence was associated with the writing of Paul Verlaine, St√©phane Mallarm√©, Arthur Rimbaud and also with the fiction of Joris-Karl Huysmans with his novel in 1884 \\"Against Nature‚Äù. A mixture of alcoholism, aimless travel, passion, falls, and a marked rejection of the modern bourgeoisie were characteristic of Verlaine's work as one of the cursed poets. The main lines of his poetry are reflected in his composition entitled \\"Art Poetique\\". Arthur Rimbaud,was another of the so known cursed poets because of his friendship with Verlaine, he devoted some years to poetry, declared himself in constant rebellion against the bourgeoisie and the mediocrity of society; aspects that are highlighted in his works. Among them are \\"Illuminations\\" (1886) or \\"A Season in Hell\\" (1873). Huysmans' novel focused almost entirely on the inner life of its sick aristocratic protagonist, Des Esseintes, who displays his obsessive sensual experiments. Dorian Gray's passion for studying and collecting jewellery or perfume or church vestments, and surrounding himself with exotic and sensual objects, reflects Des Esseintes' search for increasingly refined sensory experiences. In England, Oscar Wilde was considered as a Dandy, along with Arthur Symons and the poet Ernest Dowson and some writers associated with the yellow book. Wilde was very known at the time because of his assiduous presence in theatres and clubs in London; He created a fashion in the London of the time with his sense of style. He liked to joke saying that his life was a ‚Äúwork of art‚Äù. However, he paid a high price for his decadent style; as he was imprisoned on charges of homosexuality. Arthur Symons, defined decadence as \\"a new, beautiful and interesting illness\\", in his work \\"The Declining Movement in Literature\\" (1893). Symons, as well as other decadent authors, considered this as a criticism of the society that was becoming ostentatious and sophisticated. However, the decadence these poets spoke of was directed to the outlook on literature and art, that is, the field of art and literature, and was never seen by the poets as a social decadence; even though they showed their contempt for the bourgeois society of the time, this bourgeoisie was seen by them as powerful, strong and limiting in the realisation of artistic sensibility.  Term Decadentism  The term has a meaning that is very difficult to specify given its high historical content and diversity of criteria. It was first coined in France in 1880 and was very controversial. Initially it was created in a derogatory sense to minimise the artistic value of poets and writers who expressed their discontent and the existential crisis of art in the face of modernity. However, it was received with pride by all those artists who were fighting for the renewal of sensibility, taste for aesthetics, ethics, art and life in the face of a society that, according to their criteria, was in decline, because they were trying to preserve beauty, art and heroism, using the term as a flag of struggle.  Main Aspects  ¬∑ It was the antithesis of the poetic movement of the Parnassians and of their doctrine inspired by the classical ideal of art for art's sake, replacing it with the ideal of poetry that tends towards the quality of decadent music. ¬∑ It defies the morals and bourgeois customs of the time. ¬∑ Evades from everyday reality exalting individual heroism by exploring the most extreme regions of human sensitivity and unconsciousness ¬∑ It was a purely artistic and philosophical movement, the decline was never in a social sense, they referred to literature and art. ¬∑ It was a movement of resistance to modernity. ¬∑ They sought to preserve beauty, art and heroism, using the term as a fighting flag.  Italian Decadentism  The adoption of Decadentism in Italy was less acute than in the rest of Europe, especially because of the influence of the Scapigliatura that was already taking place in Italy, this movement first generated a conflict between artist and society Unlike European decadence, in Italy this movement is distinguished by its visibly humanistic quality and by the very strong link with the classical tradition. The ability to investigate problems closely linked to the unconscious also seems to be limited. On the other hand, the level of depth with which Decadentism is adopted in Italy is more superficial and its use is oriented not only to literature and the arts, since some exponents also extended it to the society openly characterised by vulgarity and barbarism, which unlike Europe, the decadence was never directed to the social aspect, only to literature, even though bourgeois society was depraved it overlapped under a status of superiority.  Italian Representatives  The Italian decadence was characterised by the research for new spiritual values through aestheticism and three of its most representative authors were Gabriele D'Annunzio, Giovanni Pascoli and Antonio Fogazzaro whom maintained among themselves a very subjective image of society and the world and expressed their ideas each in a unique way. Giovanni Pascoli (1855-1912) Giovanni Pascoli was characterised by a personality that mixes the extrovert with the innocent and in his works he managed to establish his own symbolism inspired by the classical tradition but keeping innovation as a standard. His works maintained the feeling, the emotions of the human being and the small details of life in a deep sense of existence with an emblematic language intentionally created to awaken emotions and intuitions in human beings, being a reference of Italian literature. Pascoli brings together many aspects in his works, managing to establish a balance between reality and fantasy. His main works were: 1891: Myricae. 1897: Poemetti, Il fanciullino. 1903: Canti di Castelvecchio. 1904: Miei scritti di varia umanit√†, Poemi conviviali. 1906: Odi e Inni, Primi poemetti. 1909: Pensieri e discorsi, Nuovi poemetti, Poemi italici. 1911: Poemi di Risorgimento. 1912: La grande proletaria si √® mossa. =Gabriele D'Annunzio (1863-1938)= He was characterized by an overwhelming personality that even led him to venture into politics and become an inspiration for figures like Mussolini and Hitler. D'Annunzio's work stood out for its famous prose, but he added other artistic expressions to his conception of decadence such as narrative, lyrics and theatre, giving it a very personal and superficial touch of what decadence was in the rest of Europe. D'Annunzio took on the characteristics of decadence as a lover of good taste, aesthetics, the aristocratic and his hatred of the ordinary and banal. His art is aimed at beauty, music, elegance and exalting nature with a peculiar language in his works that encompasses the five senses, making reading them an enriching experience. Alcycone is considered by many as D‚ÄôAnnunzio‚Äôs masterpiece. Among his creations, the following stand out: 1879: Primo vere. 1882: Canto novo. 1893: Poesia celeste. 1899: La Gioconda, la citt√† morta. 1902: Francesca da Rimini. 1904: Maia, Elettra, Alcyone, La hija de Iorio. 1911: Le martyre de Saint Sebastien. 1912: Merope. 1920: Asterope. 1926: Citt√† del silenzio. Antonio Fogazzaro (1842-1911) He aspired to a new ideal of art contrary to impersonality and adopted prose and especially the novel as the genre with which he could best reach a large audience. 1881: Malombra. 1885: Daniele Cortis. 1888: Il mistero del poeta. 1895: Il piccolo vecchio mondo. 1901: Piccolo mondo moderno. 1905: Il Santo. 1910: Leila.

Plot summary The novel is set during a ten-year interval, from 68-58 BC, which Julius Caesar spent mainly in Rome, climbing the political ladder and outmaneuvering his many enemies. It opens with Caesar returning early from his quaestorship in Spain, and closes with his epochal departure for the Gallic campaigns. Some of the pivotal moments include Caesar's marriage to Pompeia; his curule aedileship; his narrow election as Pontifex Maximus in 63 BC; his praetorship in 62 BC; his divorce from Pompeia; his governorship of Further Spain; the first time he was hailed imperator on the field by his troops, the blocking of his triumphal parade by Marcus Porcius Cato; the creation of the First Triumvirate, which Caesar formed with Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus in 60 BC; his betrothal of his daughter Julia to Pompey; his marriage to Calpurnia; and his first consulship, in 59 BC. Reflecting the title, Caesar's divorce and remarriage come into play, as does his daughter's marriage, his lengthy affair with Servilia and his close relationship with his mother, Aurelia. However, most of the plot is concerned with the political struggles of Caesar's rise to power, his conflict with the conservative 'boni' faction, and his election to each post on the Roman ladder of government.

Buddhism is one of the major religions of Taiwan. Taiwanese people predominantly practice Mahayana Buddhism, Confucian principles, local practices and Taoist tradition. Roles for religious specialists from both Buddhist and Taoist traditions exist on special occasions such as for childbirth and funerals. Of these, a smaller number identify more specifically with Chinese Buddhist teachings and institutions, without necessarily eschewing practices from other Asian traditions. Around 35% of the population believes in Buddhism. Taiwanese government statistics distinguish Buddhism from Taoism, giving almost equal numbers for both. In 2005, the census recorded 8 million Buddhists and 7.6 million Taoists, out of a total population of 23 million. Many of Taiwan's self-declared \\"Taoists\\" actually observe the more syncretistic practices associated with Chinese traditional religion which is based on Buddhism. Self- avowed Buddhists may also be adherents of more localized faiths such as Yiguandao, which also emphasize Buddhist figures like Guanyin or Maitreya and espouse vegetarianism. Distinguishing features of Taiwanese Buddhism is the emphasis on the practice of vegetarianism, the influence of Humanistic Buddhism, and the prominence of large centralized Buddhist organizations. Four Buddhist teachers who founded institutions that are particularly influential are popularly referred to as the \\"Four Heavenly Kings of Taiwanese Buddhism\\", one for each cardinal direction, with their corresponding institutions referred to as the \\"Four Great Mountains\\". They are: :*North (Jinshan): Master Sheng-yen (ËÅñÂö¥, d. 2009) of Dharma Drum Mountain (Ê≥ïÈºìÂ±±) :*South (Dashu): Master Hsing Yun (ÊòüÈõ≤) of Fo Guang Shan (‰ΩõÂÖâÂ±±) :*East (Hualien): Master Cheng Yen (Ë≠âÂö¥) of the Tzu Chi Foundation (ÊÖàÊøüÂü∫ÈáëÊúÉ) :*West (Nantou): Master Wei Chueh (ÊÉüË¶∫, d. 2016) of Chung Tai Shan (‰∏≠Âè∞Â±±) Following the Chinese Civil War, Buddhism experienced a rapid increase in popularity in Taiwan, attributed to Taiwan's economic miracle following the war and several major Buddhist organizations promoting modern values such as equality, freedom and reason, which was attractive to the country's growing middle class.Democracy's Dharma: Religious Renaissance and Political Development in Taiwan by RichardMadsen Review by: Scott Pacey The China Journal, No. 60 , pp. 203‚Äì205 (University of Chicago press, July 2008) 203]. Taiwanese Buddhist institutions are known for their involvement in secular society, including the providing of a number of public goods and services such as colleges, hospitals and disaster relief. History=Early years Ven. Wei Chueh, a traditional Ch√°n Buddhist master in Taiwan. Buddhism was brought to Taiwan in the era of Dutch colonialism by settlers from the Chinese provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. The Dutch, who controlled Taiwan from 1624 until 1663, discouraged Buddhism, since idol worship was punishable by public flogging and banishment by Dutch law at the time.Jones 3‚Äì4 In 1662, Koxinga drove the Dutch from Taiwan. His son Zheng Jing established the first Buddhist temple in Taiwan. During this period, Buddhist practice was not pervasive, with Buddhist monks only performing funeral and memorial services.Jones 3 When the Qing dynasty took control of Taiwan in 1683, large numbers of monks came from Fujian and Guangdong provinces to establish temples, particularly those devoted to Guanyin, and a number of different Buddhist sects flourished. Monastic Buddhism, however, did not arrive until the 1800s. Japanese period During the Japanese rule of Taiwan (1895‚Äì1945), many schools of Japanese Buddhism came to Taiwan to propagate their Buddhism teachings, such as Kegon (ËèØÂé≥ÂÆó), Tendai (Â§©Âè∞ÂÆó), Shingon Buddhism (ÁúüË®ÄÂÆó), Rinzai school (Ëá®Ê∏àÂÆó), S≈çt≈ç (ÊõπÊ¥ûÂÆó), J≈çdo sh≈´ (ÊµÑÂúüÂÆó), J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ (ÊµÑÂúüÁúüÂÆó) and Nichiren Buddhism (Êó•ËìÆÂÆó). During the same period, most Taiwan Buddhist temples came to affiliate with one of three central temples: :*North (Keelung): Yueh-mei Mountain (ÊúàÁúâÂ±±), founded by Master Shan-hui (ÂñÑÊÖß) :*Center (Miaoli): Fa-yun Temple (Ê≥ïÈõ≤ÂØ∫), founded by Master Chueh- li (Ë¶∫Á´ã) :*South (Tainan): Kai-yuan Temple (ÈñãÂÖÉÂØ∫), also founded by Chueh-li As a Japanese colony, Taiwan fell under the influence of Japanese Buddhism. Many temples experienced pressure to affiliate with Japanese lineages, including many whose status with respect to Buddhism or Taoism was unclear. (Emphasis on the Chinese folk religion was widely considered a form of protest against Japanese rule.) Attempts were made to introduce a married priesthood (as in Japan). These failed to take root, as emphasis on vegetarianism and/or clerical celibacy became another means of anti-Japanese protest. World War II With Japan's defeat in World War II, Taiwan fell under the control of Chiang Kai-shek's government, resulting in contrary political pressures. In 1949, a number of mainland monks fled to Taiwan alongside Chiang's military forces, and received preferential treatment by the new regime. During this period, Buddhist institutions fell under the authority of the government- controlled Buddhist Association of the Republic of China (). Originally established in 1947 (in Nanjing), it was dominated by \\"mainland\\" monks. Its authority began to decline in the 1960s, when independent Buddhist organizations began to be permitted; and especially since the 1987 lifting of martial law in Taiwan. Post War Period Main sanctuary of Fo Guang Shan Monastery near Kaohsiung Buddhism experienced rapid growth in Taiwan following the war, which has been attributed to the immigration of several Buddhist teachers from Communist China after the defeat of the nationalists in the Chinese Civil War and the growth of Humanistic Buddhism (‰∫∫Èñì‰ΩõÊïô). 'Humanistic Buddhism' promotes a direct relationship between Buddhist communities and the wider society. Also known as Socially Engaged Buddhism, its focuses on the improvement of society through participation in aspects such as environmental conservation. Humanistic Buddhism is the major distinguishing trait of modern Taiwanese Buddhism. Humanistic Buddhism traces its roots to Chinese monk Venerable Taixu (1890‚Äì1947), who wanted to reform the continuous focus on ritual and ceremony. Taixu promoted more direct contributions to society through the Buddhist community and was a significant influence for Master Yin Shun, who is generally considered to be the figure who brought Humanistic Buddhism to Taiwan. These two figures were the major influences of the Buddhist teachers that shaped modern Taiwanese Buddhism. One of the first private networks of Buddhist centers was that of Hsing Yun, who was directly inspired by Taixu. Hsing Yun first attained popularity through the new medium of radio broadcasts in the 1950s and later through publication of Buddhist audio on phonograph discs, leading to the founding of Fo Guang Shan in 1967.\\"East Asia, Buddhism\\". Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations, by Linda Woodhead et al., Routledge, 2016, pp. 102‚Äì103. Another major figure was Master Cheng Yen, a direct student of Yin Shun, who founded Tzu Chi, which would become Taiwan's largest Buddhist organization and charity. During the 1980s, Buddhist leaders pressed Taiwan's Ministry of Education to relax various policies preventing the organization of a Buddhist university. The eventual result was that in the 1990s‚Äîflush with contributions made possible by Taiwan's \\"miracle economy\\"‚Äînot one but half a dozen such schools emerged, each associated with a different Buddhist leader. Among them were Tzu Chi University, Hsuan-Chuang University, Huafan University, Fo Guang University, Nanhua University, and Dharma Drum Buddhist College. The regulations of the Ministry of Education prohibit recognized colleges and universities from requiring religious belief or practice, and these institutions therefore appear little different from others of their rank. (Degrees granted by seminaries, of which Taiwan has several dozen, are not recognized by the government.) In a reversal of the older historical relationship, these Taiwanese Buddhists would later play a role in the revival of Buddhism in mainland China later in the century. In 2001, Master Hsin Tao opened the Museum of World Religions in New Taipei. In addition to exhibits on ten different world religions, the museum also features \\"Avatamsaka World,\\" a model illustrating the Avatamsaka Sutra. Development of the Vajrayana schools In recent decades, Vajrayana Buddhism has increased in popularity in Taiwan as Tibetan lamas from the four major Tibetan schools (Kagyu, Nyingma, Sakya and Gelug) have visited the island, including the 14th Dalai Lama, who visited the island thrice in 1997, 2001 and 2009. The Koyasan Shingon sect of Japan also maintains its own practice centers and temples in Taiwan, some of them historically established during the Japanese period of Taiwanese history, while others were established in the post-WWII era in order to re-establish an orthodox Esoteric Buddhist lineage that was long eliminated during the Tang Dynasty. The True Buddha School, founded in the late 1980s by Taiwanese native Lu Sheng-yen, is one of the more well known of the Vajrayana sects in Taiwan, although at least seven established Buddhist organisations have charged that the group functions as a personality cult. Rapid Growth in the Late 20th Century Main path at Fo Guang Shan Buddha Museum Statistics provided by the Interior Ministry show that Taiwan's Buddhist population grew from 800,000 in 1983 to 4.9 million in 1995, a 600 percent increase. In contrast, the population grew about twelve percent over the same time period. Additionally, in the same period the number of registered Buddhist temples increased from 1,157 to 4,020, and the number of monks and nuns was up 9,300 monks and nuns, up from 3,470 in 1983.Lin, Diana. \\"As Buddhism Grows, So Grows Its Impact,\\" Free China Review, 9. Scholars attribute this trend to a number of unique factors in Taiwan, including the activity of the various charismatic teachers who were active during this time, as well as the migration of devout lay Buddhists fleeing religious persecution in Mainland China. On top of that, several officials in the government of Chiang Kai-Shek were devoted Buddhists who helped support Buddhism when the fleeing Buddhist leaders arrived in Taiwan. Other factors scholars cite for the rapid growth include a general search for identity among Taiwanese citizens, increased urbanization as well as a sense of isolation in an increasingly impersonal society. Main hall at Tzu Chi Foundation The growth of Buddhism rose most sharply in the late 1980s when the Taiwanese government became much more liberalized. Aside from societal influences there have also been a number of developments when it comes to the Buddhist community. The modernization of Taiwan coincided with the rise of Humanistic Buddhism. The growth of Buddhism in Taiwan was spearheaded by a number of organizations developing during this period led by various teachers who took a socially engaged approach in accordance with Humanistic Buddhist philosophy. As Buddhist groups become more involved in people's everyday lives there has been a general push to make the teachings of Buddhism more relevant and applicable to modern- day issues such as environmental protection, human rights and stress management. These developments helped create an image of Buddhism as being highly relevant in the modern world to the Taiwanese population. Rapid economic growth and general prosperity has also been an important factor for Buddhism in Taiwan. As people acquire time-saving goods such as cars and appliances, extra time can be allocated to an activity which can help provide meaning or a goal to people's lives. This has been speculated as being the case in Taiwan where people look for deeper satisfaction beyond the immediate and the materialistic. Economic prosperity has also meant that donations and volunteering have increased throughout a number of Taiwanese communities. Full view of Dharma Drum Mountain Monastery While other religious groups, such as Christian churches, took similar approaches and had many of the same societal benefits in Taiwan during this period of Buddhist resurgence, a major advantage Buddhism had was that it had long played a role in Chinese history and culture. Groups such as Christian churches were seen as foreign and therefore Buddhism had much greater appeal to the young people in Taiwan at the time who were looking for a sense of ethnic identity and to fill the ideological needs of the more socially conscious public as Taiwan modernized. Another advantage Buddhism had over other religious groups was that the growth of Buddhism in Taiwan was being led primarily by large Buddhist organizations such as Tzu Chi and Fo Guang Shan. Organizations such as these were headed by charismatic leaders such as the Four Heavenly Kings and the size of the organizations allowed for large scale fundraising and public events, giving the major Buddhist organizations an advantage in terms of resources and publicity. In addition, most of the contemporary Taiwanese Buddhist organizations leading the resurgence were known for their use of modern technology to appeal to the masses and some were known for championing popular progressive causes at the time. Significant funding and a more liberal approach to religion allowed folk religions and Buddhism in particular to prosper in Taiwan during the post war era. This is in contrast to the severe restrictions Buddhism and religion faced in mainland China between 1949‚Äì78. Buddhism, among other aspects, was seen as an aspect of Chinese culture that was holding the nation back. Many monks and nuns were forced to give up their monastic lives and become part general society. It wasn't until 1978 that Buddhism has been able to re-surface in mainland China. The much different environment in Taiwan allowed Buddhism to have a very significant religious presence in Taiwan since the late 20th century. Many scholars now consider Taiwan to be the center of Chinese Buddhism with many schools, temples and shrines established all over the island by many prominent Buddhist leaders.

The series takes place around the city of Scrapyard where residents, of whom many are heavily modified by cybernetics to better cope with the hard life, are forced to make a living. The series focuses on Alita, the protagonist and title character, a young cyborg with amnesia struggling to uncover her forgotten past through the only thing she remembers from it: fighting. Early on in the story, Daisuke Ido, a bounty-hunting cybernetic doctor who finds and revives Alita plays a major role as well, but midway through the manga he becomes marginalized as focus begins to increasingly shift to Desty Nova, an eccentric nanotechnology scientist who has fled from Tiphares (Zalem, in Japanese version). Nova is the mastermind behind many of the enemies and trials that Alita faces, but does not make an actual appearance until more than two years into the story, although he is alluded to early on. Finally, Kaos, Desty Nova's son, a frail and troubled radio DJ with psychometric powers, also begins to play a crucial role after he comes in contact with Alita. He broadcasts his popular radio show from the wastelands outside the Scrapyard, staying away from the increasing conflict between Tiphares and the rebel army Barjack. Protagonist=Alita ; Portrayed by Rosa Salazar Alita or in the original Japanese version, originally named before her amnesia, is the main protagonist. She is known for her fighting prowess as a practitioner of the powerful Martian cyborg martial art and her racing skill at , the most popular sport in the western district of Scrapyard. In the manga, Alita is occasionally referred to as \\"octopus lips\\" due to her pouty expression. Alita's background and history were briefly hinted at, but were not explored until Last Order and more extensively in Mars Chronicle, which reveals that in her previous life, she was highly instrumental in creating the world within which the manga series are set. Alita takes on a variety of roles through the manga, starting out as a licensed bounty-hunter known as a \\"hunter-warrior\\". She later becomes a Motorball player nicknamed the \\"Killing Angel\\" and eventually the Top League champion, after which she retired from the game and became a part-time fight instructor and bar singer. Two years later, after being forced to use a firearm (an illegal capital offense) to defeat a berserked Zapan, she is pardoned from execution and recruited by the Tipharean Ground Investigation Bureau for ten years as an elite ground agent of TUNED, a counterinsurgency task force, during which she is nicknamed the \\"Death Angel\\" for her prowess, unknowingly also serving as the basis for the development of GIB's combat androids known as the AR (Alita Replica) series which debut towards the end of the original series. In Last Order, she spearheads a combat team called the \\"Space Angels\\" which includes three other AR series replicas, and competes in the LADDER-sponsored Zenith of Things Tournament before becoming the first civilian team to win it. During this competition, Alita is given the relic \\"Fata Morgana\\" which grants her direct access to the quantum supercomputer Melchizedek and makes her into the Last Order agent. In the original manga, \\"Gally\\"/\\"Alita\\" was the name of Ido's pet black cat, who died a month before he found the remains of cyborg girl in the Tiphares junkyard. Gally the cat was a male, and Ido's friend Gonzu comments that it is strange to name a female cyborg after a male cat. The cat makes an appearance in the manga as part of a dream that Alita experiences while being trapped in Desty Nova's Ouroboros program. In the dream, Alita is named \\"Gally\\" while the cat is named \\"Alita\\". Nova himself appears in this dream as \\"Uncle Nova\\", reflecting that he cannot get along with the cat. After Kaos in the guise of a dream-Den attempts to rescue the real Alita from the Ouroboros and begins fighting with the giant Great Martian King dream-robot, the dream-Alita and dream-Gally merge, appearing in the form of the real Alita. The side story \\"Holy Night\\" reveals that Ido took the original Alita in shortly after he arrived in the Scrapyard, at least five years before he found Alita in the Tiphares junkyard. In the original manga series, Alita transformed into a Tree of Life in order to save both the cities of Tiphares and Scrapyard, and after five years is reborn as a full-flesh human. This ending was changed in Last Order to Alita being killed by a bomb in an ambush and reconstructed by Desty Nova, although this reborn version is later revealed to be a replica android of her with a brain bio-chip that contains the same memories and combat abilities of the original, while her original organic brain is actually sealed inside a box that she is tasked to carrying the whole time, which is, in its own turn, became attached to an organic version of Alita which, as in the original, find peace in family life with Figure. In Mars Chronicle, her childhood origin story as the cyborg girl Yoko is explored further, as well as her rivalry with her estranged adopted sister Erica. Daisuke Ido ; Portrayed by Christoph Waltz is a cybernetics physician (cyberphysician), a doctor who specializes in operations on cyborgs who lives in The Scrapyard. He is responsible for restoring Alita after finding her in the Tiphares dump heap, a massive pile of garbage ejected from Tiphares. Ido also has a second line of work as a hunter-warrior. He is a former citizen of Tiphares, the great floating city suspended over The Scrapyard, as is indicated by the mark on his forehead, and is the first Tipharean introduced. After being expelled from Tiphares for unknown reasons, Ido trained as a cyberphysician and ‚Äì five years before the main story starts ‚Äì opened his own clinic. Ido considers Alita to be like a daughter to himKishiro, Battle Angel Alita: Killing Angel, page 15.Kishiro, Battle Angel Alita: Angel of Victory, pages 16, 119. and their relationship progresses through several stages as Alita grows mentally and emotionally. As Ido wanted Alita to remain pure and unsullied,Kishiro, Battle Angel Alita, pages 34-37. he is originally opposed to her becoming a hunter-warrior, but accepts her decision. He later accepts her decisions to play motorball and \\"leave the nest\\" after retiring from motorball. Ido is later nearly driven to madness and erases his own memory after learning the secret of Tiphares. Daisuke Ido has no active role in Battle Angel Alita: Last Order besides appearing in Alita's thoughts, that is until the Alita Quest arc.anonymous, Battle Angel Alita: Last Order, chapter 113. In the 2019 film adaptation, his name is changed to Dyson Ido and he is portrayed by Oscar-winning Austrian actor Christoph Waltz. Antagonists=Desty Nova Portrayed by Edward Norton is a mad scientist and former citizen of Tiphares, who has used his extensive scientific knowledge and expertise in nanotechnology to save Makaku and Jashugan, as well as resurrect Ido and Alita from states that would normally be classified as \\"dead\\", even in this world where cyborgs are commonplace. He fled Tiphares to obtain the freedom necessary to experiment with live humans, a component he deems necessary in his research of karma and psychological capacity. A dream- sequence shows that had his situation been different, he could have easily been a loving, protective father-figure for Alita. He has injected himself with nanomachines that can repair dismemberment and give him pseudo- immortality. Nova possesses knowledge of the secret of Tiphares, one that could drive its citizens mad if released. Nova has a liking for the dessert cake flan, and can often be seen eating it, boasting that he thinks better while enjoying it. Although he is the main antagonist in the original series, Nova becomes much more of a neutral, ambiguous figure in Last Order, where he is one of Alita's key allies. Nova has two assistants, but they do not appear in Last Order. A prodigal scientist who goes beyond the seemingly mad, amoral man and becomes a more complex ally and adviser. He appears in several different incarnations due to his \\"Stereotomy\\" ability, an atmospheric nanotechnological process that, should Nova be killed, automatically restores him as he was before death, right down to his memories and even clothing. * Original Nova: At the end of the original series, Alita decapitates Nova in battle. Nova survives regardless thanks to a second \\"back-up\\" brain bio-chip stored in his abdomen. After killing Alita with a bomb, Nova transports her remains to Tiphares and, along with his assistant Jim Roscoe, resurrects her with a new \\"Imaginos Body\\" with a neuronal accelerator which gives her unlimited potentials. In the original series, Nova guides Alita to confront the Melchizedek ‚Äî the deus ex machina of Tiphares ‚Äî about the truth of Tiphares and Ketheres' history. Nova provokes Melchizedek too far, causing it to go haywire and self-destruct. To save Tiphares from being purged and collide with Scrapyard below, Alita takes an Imaginos trigger given by Nova and sacrificed herself to secure the Sky Hook by fusing with it. Nova immediately regrets giving Alita the trigger, as he cannot bear being saved by her selflessness, and goes completely mad. Five years later, Kiyomi and Figure encounters a senile, insane Nova, who lures them in to a cavern deep in Ketheres, where they find Alita reborn from the Tree of Life with a human body. :This original ending is retconned in Last Order, where Alita wakes up in the new Imaginos Body only to find Nova has died disembowelled a week earlier. A pre-recorded video message then reveals that Nova exposes the brain bio-chip conspiracy to the Tipharean population, resulting in mass insanity quickly spreading and devastating the floating metropolis, culminating in a chaotic two-week civil war. His assistant Roscoe also goes crazy and kills Nova, looting his two brain bio-chips, which later fall into Alita's hands. However, it is later revealed that Nova has already invented the Stereotomy process, which allows him to create reincarnations of himself, making him effectively an immortal presence. * Nova II: After Roscoe kills the Original Nova, the Stereonomy process creates \\"Nova II\\". This version of Nova decides to replace Alita's living brain with a bio-chip before she awakens from her resurrection, placing her brain in a protected crate known as the \\"F-Box\\". After Alita awakens, he insinuates himself as an ally of an unsuspecting Alita, offering to help her locate the brain of Lou Collins in exchange for bodyguard duties as he travels to Ketheres. Once at Ketheres, Nova II encounters Aga Mbadi, who explains that he, along with the Tipharean citizenry, are \\"manufactured\\" with the eventual goal of producing geniuses such as himself. Mbadi then defeats Alita and her team and captures Nova II, destroying his body and keeping the bio-chips with the intent of assimilating them into his mind; he later decides instead to resurrect Nova II as his new assistant and henchman: \\"Super Nova\\". * Super Nova: Mbadi created a powerful new body for Nova II later dubbed \\"Super Nova\\". The bio-chip pair of Nova II are now housed inside the skull and run parallel to each other, similar to Mbadi's own ability, and making this Nova more intelligent yet far more ruthless and vicious. Super Nova is also empowered with a hacking ability similar to Mbadi's, called \\"Secare Deum\\"; like his superior, it gives him complete mastery over electronics and machinery in his presence. Super Nova confronts Alita at the Incubator where Lou Collins' brain is held, revealing that the F-Box contains Alita's own brain, and offers a trade in exchange for inserting Alita's brain into the Incubator. He then destroys Alita when she attempts to renege on the deal afterward; Alita survives the ordeal more powerful than ever, but Super Nova remains a serious threat and major villain. * Porta Nova: After Alita survives her defeat after first meeting Mbadi, she recruits hacker Ping Wu, using the Original Nova's bio-chips as collateral. Wu installs one of the chips into a portable device he dubs \\"Porta Nova\\". This version of Nova is incapable of independent movement, but is able to hack into computers alongside Alita and Wu. He accompanies Alita on her mission to raid the Incubator at Ketheres where Lou's brain is held, providing helpful advice and support. As one of the Original Nova's bio-chips, he has no memory of any event later than his death at the hands of Jim Roscoe. Porta Nova is present when Alita encounters Super Nova at the Incubator, and is destroyed completely by Super Nova himself after he refuses to work with his more diabolical persona. * Nova X: When Nova II's body is destroyed by Mbadi, the Stereotomy process once again creates another version of Nova back on Tiphares. This version of Nova has no unique ability of his own, and has no shared knowledge of events with other Novas after Nova II is killed. Nova X is primarily interested with uniting the surviving Tiphareans against aggression from the outer space factions, often espousing the values of flan as he does so. Nova X is later recruited by Porta Nova to help battle Super Nova, who reveals that all life on Earth is soon to be purged by Ketherean forces. However, when Porta Nova and Alita are both destroyed, Nova X is forced to make a hasty escape. Makaku Portrayed by Jackie Earle Haley Born as a human, , known in Battle Angel OVA as , spent his entire life in the sewers of the Scrapyard, captivated by the life he could see outside. Three years before the beginning of the main story, Makaku was burned with a flamethrower by a pair of Scrapyard pranksters while looking at the goings on through a sewer grate. He survived the attack, but his body began to rot and he nearly died. Desty Nova found Makaku and offered to give him a new, personalized body reflecting his innermost desires. Makaku's new cyborg body consisted of a large head attached to a long, maggot-like body, which allowed him a great deal of mobility. He was also characterized by his long tongue and tendency to slobber. A large spike on top of his head could be fired as a single use projectile weapon. However, Makaku's deadliest ability was being able to take over the bodies of other cyborgs by using his body to jack into their spinal columns and then remove their heads with his newly won control. He would take over powerful cyborg bodies and use their strength to acquire brains (preferably human, but even dog) in order to eat them to satisfy his endorphin-addiction. Makaku justified his existence in destruction, and despite a bounty being placed on him, was so formidable that no hunter-warrior dared go after him for years. Makaku is the first major adversary that Alita faces. In their first fight, she succeeds in crippling the body he is then possessing as well as blinding him in his left eye by impaling it with one of her arms. However, her first cyborg body is destroyed in the process. Makaku survives the fight and almost kills Ido by impaling him with his head spike, swearing vengeance on both him and Alita before escaping. He seeks out the reigning champion of the Coliseum, Kinuba, to take over his custom-built Power Body. Makaku then goes up against Alita in her new Berserker Body in the Scrapyard sewers. After a long fight, the Power Body is destroyed and Makaku nearly kills Alita in a plasma explosion that he triggers. However, she creates an electromagnetic barrier to shield them both, enabling her to talk with him. Makaku tells her his life story, revealing that she is the first person who seriously took notice of him by trying to stop him. For the first time in his life he is at peace as he is consumed by the plasma. Zapan Portrayed by Ed Skrein was a hunter- warrior who became embittered against Alita after she questioned his bravery in front of the other hunter-warriors at Bar Kansas and defeated him and a large number of them in a brawl. Since this incident he nursed a grudge against her but did not try to confront her directly. He noticed that Alita had taken an interest in Hugo as well as the latter's connection to Vector, who was the top dealer in the Scrapyard's black market parts. Zapan uncovered Hugo and his accomplices as criminals engaged in cyborg spinal column theft and nearly captured him. He reported Hugo to the Factory when he went to collect the bounties on Hugo's accomplices, informing Alita, who was also there, what had happened to Hugo. Deducing that she would attempt to flee with Hugo, Zapan took Daisuke Ido hostage and rounded up numerous hunter-warriors and a netman. He confronted Alita when she was on her way back to Ido's clinic with Hugo's body, but his plan was foiled when it appeared that she had taken Hugo's head. However upon closer investigation he saw that she had connected her life support system to it, keeping his brain alive. When he tried to get the head, the netman warned him that stealing another hunter's bounty was illegal, allowing Alita to attack him and shear his face off. Zapan fell off the high rise they were on, but survived. He later obtained a new face and began working in a soup kitchen with Sara, the daughter of Murdock. Sara accepted Zapan and became his lover despite her father's opposition. The night of Alita's challenge race against Jashugan, Zapan saw the broadcast and was struck by a sudden fear that resulted in him clawing off his second face. He accidentally killed Sara when she tried to stop him and thus became a bounty, being hunted by Murdock for three years. Murdock finally confronted Zapan in the sewers with his four cyborg dogs, but Alita intervened and gave Zapan the opportunity to attack her while her back was turned and she played a song on a portable keyboard. Zapan could not bring himself to attack and was torn to pieces by Murdock's dogs. However his head survived and was recovered by Barzarld. Desty Nova was able to partially restore Zapan's brain and in response to its deepest desire for revenge, released the safety lock on the Berserker Body to allow the brain to merge with it. However the body went out of control and after fusing with Zapan's brain destroyed Nova's lab and manor, killing Ido who had been there in an attempt to recover the Berserker Body from Nova. Zapan tracked Alita to Bar New Kansas but when he found that she was not there he killed Gonzu and the hunter-warriors who attacked him. Murdock faced him and allowed Shumira and Master to escape, destroying the bar and dying in the process, but Zapan survived. He then went on a rampage through the Scrapyard with Factory Army powerless to stop him. Alita confronted him the following day armed with a Smith & Wesson Model 60 revolver equipped with hollow-point bullets loaded with Collapser nanobots that Nova had developed to destroy the Berserker Body at the molecular level. Despite a close, tough fight, she was able to fire two rounds into Zapan, which caused the Berserker Body to break down. Zapan made a last-ditch attempt to absorb Alita, which she thwarted by swallowing some of the Collapser. Prior to his death Alita saw a vision of him and Sara together in which Zapan expressed regret for what he had done and was forgiven and accepted by Sara. Before hitting the ground, Zapan's last act was to form a pair of wings to break Alita's fall. Despite surviving the fight and defeating Zapan Alita was sentenced to death by the Factory for the Class A crime of using a firearm. Supporting characters=Scrapyard residentsGonzu= A former cyber veterinarian who now runs a Japanese food shack, is the closest friend that Ido has in the Scrapyard and is shown visiting Ido at his clinic. He saves Ido after the latter is almost killed by Makaku, and under Ido's direction, transfers Alita from her first cyborg body into the Berserker Body. Gonzu also helps Ido transplant Hugo's head onto a cyborg body. A regular at Bar Kansas, Gonzu is the first person killed by Zapan when he goes to Bar New Kansas in the Berserker Body in search of Alita, accidentally blocking the strike aimed at Shumira. The side story \\"Seiyakyoku\\" reveals that six years before Ido found Alita, he saved Gonzu's life when he found him near death in the street. At this time, Gonzu's food shack was a cart that he pulled. Gonzu aids Ido, who has been rendered homeless, by hosting him and Carol and getting him in touch with the cyberphysician Gauss. =Hugo= ; Portrayed by Keean Johnson Hugo, known in Japan as , is Alita's first love. He is an orphaned teenager who was raised by his much older brother and sister-in-law Nana. He ran away from home after Nana betrayed his brother to the hunter-warrior Clive Lee for building an illegal hot-air balloon to attempt to fly to Tiphares. Since then he has inherited a burning desire to go to the floating city. He first encountered Vector three years before the start of the main story, when he recognized his brother's hand being sold by one of the latter's dealers, and impressed Vector by voluntarily trading his hand for his brother's, so part of his dead brother can go to Tiphares as well when he goes to there. Believing that Vector could access Tiphares because of his pull in the Scrapyard, he fell for Vector's offer to get him there if he could bring him 10 million chips. Hugo ostensibly performs odd maintenance jobs for Scrapyard residents such as Ido, but has taken to illegally supplementing his income by posing along with his accomplices Tanji and Van, as a lubrication crew for cyborgs. They then ambush and paralyze their victims to steal their spinal columns, as these fetch the highest prices on the black market for body parts. Alita meets Hugo during her hunt for the criminal Megil, and is impressed by his willingness to protect her even though he is grossly outmatched. The two then strike up a friendship which Alita makes clear she would like to take further, and she embarks on a bounty-hunting spree to help Hugo reach his 10 million chip mark. However Hugo is blinded by his obsession with Tiphares and does not reciprocate Alita's romantic interest in him. After his run in with Zapan, Hugo becomes a marked bounty. Despite learning the truth about him, Alita is still willing to go with him to Tiphares. He is mortally wounded by Clive Lee, and is only saved by Alita linking her life support to his severed head. Transplanted into a cyborg body by Ido, Hugo learns the reality that a surface dweller such as himself has no hope of reaching Tiphares. After confronting Vector with this, who also confesses it, Hugo snaps and attempts to climb one of the Factory tubes that connects Tiphares to the Scrapyard. He makes it up further than any previous person, but is crippled by a massive spiked defense ring dropped down the tube. Alita is able to reach him just before a second one is dropped, but cannot save him, as his torso is shredded. Hugo is able to share his last words with Alita before falling to his death. This subsequently leads Alita to run away from home and turn to Motorball for distraction. =Vector= ; Portrayed by Mahershala Ali is a Scrapyard businessman ‚Äî the top broker in illegal human body-parts and organs ‚Äî with a reputation for hiring powerful cyborg muscle to back him up. Vector furthermore supplies Tiphares, on a monthly basis, with one person's worth of body-parts and organs. Last Order reveals that Vector came from a poor village on the outskirts of the city, and due to the ability to instantly judge whether anyone was lying to him, became the most powerful magnate in the Scrapyard. The original series reveals that Vector is assisted by Myra, unnamed in the Japanese version, who works for Vector out of a mobile clinic. Vector buys stolen spinal columns from Hugo and ‚Äî knowing that no-one can go to Tiphares ‚Äî offered to send Hugo to Tiphares for 10 million chips. Although he used Hugo, Vector has some honor: he repeatedly protected Hugo by killing witnesses and hiding Hugo, and offered Hugo partnership of the supply routes (a highly lucrative position). Vector later sustains serious injury and escapes with his life after meeting with Den as the Barjack closed in on Tiphares, but is instrumental in restoring peace and order to the Scrapyard when Tiphares almost collapses and the factories shut down. Vector also appears in the 1993 OVA where he has a stake in the Coliseum gladiators (in addition to his black market dealings). He also he has more control over exports to Zalem (Tiphares). He is killed in the OVA when he is impaled after being confronted by Ido over Hugo. In the live-action movie, he is occasionally used as a vessel by Nova when he needs to speak with others. He is stabbed through the torso by Alita while Nova was using him to taunt her. =Shumira= is Jashugan's somewhat na√Øve, but warm-hearted younger sister. She is saved from being raped by two thugs by Ido while he is searching for Alita, a month after she ran away following Hugo's death. When he shows her a holographic image of Alita, Shumira recognizes her as a Motorball player, taking Ido to a circuit where Alita is racing and introducing him to the sport. She hosts Ido at her apartment for a week, after which they watch Jashugan at a race where he suffers a flatline attack, during which Ido has to use her brainwaves in order to successfully resuscitate Jashugan. Shumira meets Alita in person when she, Jashugan and Ido come across Alita and Ed at a Scrapyard open air restaurant. She covets Kimji, Alita's odd rotor wing pet (actually a Tipharean surveillance drone sent to spy on Alita), and asks if she can have him if Alita loses to Jashugan in arm-wrestling. As a precaution for the next flatline attack, Ido creates a direct interface that will allow him to transmit Shumira's brainwaves via radio to Jashugan's brain. Prior to his challenge race with Alita, Jashugan receives a good luck necklace from Shumira and tells her to marry Ido. He then sedates her, nullifying any effect to resuscitate him should he have another flatline attack. Shumira thus does not see her brother's final race and subsequent death. Two years after Alita quits Motorball, Shumira is working as a waitress at Bar New Kansas. She narrowly misses being killed by Zapan when he arrives in search of Alita, and survives the destruction of the bar. Along with the Bar New Kansas barkeep Master and his adopted daughter Koyomi, she winds up at a refugee camp on the outskirts of the Scrapyard, where she meets her future husband, a soup server. Shumira stays with the volunteer group and eventually she and her husband have eight children. =Koyomi= Portrayed by Lana Condor started out as an orphan adopted by the barkeep of the Bar Kansas, Master, then becoming a member of the rebel army Barjack, and then a freelance photographer who publishes a bestselling photo journal. The manga never reveals her family history nor her surname. Koyomi first appears as a baby when Daisuke Ido and Alita visits Bar Kansas, and she is subsequently kidnapped by Makaku in order to lure Alita into a fight, only to be saved by her father's dog, Duke Fang. She later forms a bond with Fury, Murdock's cyborg dog and in turn softens Murdock himself. At age 13, Koyomi ran away from home with Fury after argument with her alcoholic adopted father, encountering Kaos and reaching the underground ruins of a city from the previous era and eventually, meeting Den. Convinced by what Den says about Tiphares‚Äô evils, Koyomi joins the Barjack and participates their campaigns, drawing closer and closer to the Scrapyard where B.B. Buick gives her his camera just before he dies. A year after Den's defeat, Koyomi compiles Buick's photos into a book titled Barjack War Chronicle that becomes the Scrapyard's greatest bestseller on record. Koyomi appears in Last Order as a 14-year-old boarding with her father in a southern district antiques shop when she witnesses Kaos being run over by a taxi and subsequently helps him. She later witnesses Kaos's transformation (when he receives the paper airplane that Alita had thrown from Tiphares) and Vector's subsequent agreement to fund the Tower of Tiphares. Koyomi is the focus of the side story \\"Barjack Rhapsody\\", in which she acts on a tip that a resurrected Den has been ambushing Scrapyard supply convoys. As a result of her dealings with the eccentric Geriperi and the ambitious manager of Farm 3, Eakins, she eventually discovers a purpose in life. The side story further reveals that Koyomi a celebrity among the Barjack because of a photograph Buick took of her and Fury, which he subsequently sold. In the 2019 live-action film, Koyomi is already a teenager who hangs out with Hugo and Tanji. She does not display any of her photography skills and does not seem to be aware of their side business. Motorball-affiliated The following fictional characters are affiliated with the sport of Motorball. =Jashugan= Portrayed by Jai Courtney Jashugan, known in Japan as , is the reigning Top League champion of Motorball, the most popular sport in the western district of Scrapyard, which is a cross between gladiatoral combat and speed skating. Jashugan is perhaps the one opponent in the series whom Alita respects the most, largely because they are similar in many respects.Kishiro, Battle Angel Alita: Angel of Victory, page 183 The two also \\"see each other as competitive rivals instead of hated enemies\\".Anderson, Lisa (1 November 2005) Jashugan's only family is his slow-witted younger sister Shumira, who comes back with Ido and Alita to the eastern district to work as a waitress in Bar New Kansas. Jashugan's background prior to his Motorball career is not revealed, nor how long he has been competing in the sport. In ES 571, five years before Ido found Alita in the Tiphares junkyard, Jashugan was a rookie in the highest Motorball league, the Top League. He and his rival Esdoc were involved in a deadly accident in which Jashugan sustained massive brain damage. He would have died had not Desty Nova intervened and performed reconstructive brain surgery on him. Using a Tipharean technology called Gehirnumbau (German for \\"brain rebuild\\"), Nova used nanomachines to rebuild the column structure of Jashugan's cerebral cortex and strengthen his neurons with artificial proteins. The reconstruction not only helped Jashugan survive, but also enhanced his reflexes and allowed him to become the Motorball champion. This was in stark contrast to Ed, who also survived but became dependent on acceleration drug injections to stay competitive, which resulted in a side effect called \\"Terminal Frost\\" which forced his eventual retirement. The relationship between the two is cordial, but deep down Ed still seeks to surpass Jashugan, and tries to do this vicariously through Alita after he becomes her manager years later in ES 578. Jashugan paid a high price for his brain reconstruction as a side effect has been the constant risk of death, and he has suffered an increasing series of spasmatic attacks that have caused his heart rate to flatline. He has recovered from these attacks on his own in the past, but during a race that is watched by Daisuke Ido, Shumira, Alita and Ed, he is forced to pit by one of these attacks, it takes Ido's intervention to save his life. After this, Jashugan knows that his death is near, but cannot reconcile himself to his \\"absolute death\\".Kishiro, Battle Angel Alita: Angel of Victory, page 124 Jashugan is a master of the Maschine-Klatsch, a formidable cyborg martial art of which he is the only practitioner of following the death of his master shortly before his own death. He is also adept at focusing his chi, which enables him to concentrate a lot of power into even a normal civilian cyborg- body and defeat opponents in powered-up cyborg bodies. After Ed's retirement, no other Motorball player can match him in combat except for Alita and her Panzer-Kunst. Jashugan is so good that when he races, he must handicap himself by removing his right arm and face three-man challenge teams. His Motorball body has two grinders built into each arm capable of rotating at high speeds, which increases the deadliness of his Maschine-Klatsch as they can tear through cyborg-armor and dismember opposing players. Nonetheless, his flatline attacks have resulted in him participating in fewer races over time. After she meets Jashugan, Alita challenges him to an arm-wrestling match with her heart literally as the stakes. The match appears to end as a draw, during which Jashugan calls stop after overloading 80% of Alita's arm actuators, but Jashugan afterwards drops his arm and notes that he would have lost had it gone on for longer. To save Alita face, he proposes that they meet again on the Motorball circuit on the condition that she assemble a challenge team of at least five members including herself. Knowing that he is close to death, the match is the one thing that he has to look forward to in order to fight for Shumira and uphold his honor as champion. Prior to the race, Ido, hired as Jashugan's personal tuner, prepared a direct interface so he could transmit Shumira's brainwaves to Jashugan's brain if necessary should he suffer another flatline as a contingency, a measure he took that saved Jashugan before. J ashugan nullifies this however, by administering a sedative to his younger sister, setting himself up for a deathmatch with Alita. During the challenge race, Jashugan rips through Alita's teammates in seconds, leaving the two of them alone to fight it out. Trading blow for blow, Jashugan nearly has Alita at one point, but she is saved by Tiegel (Alita's clumsiest teammates, who manages to distract Jashugan for a few seconds). In the final moments of their battle, right when he's about to win, Jashugan suffers a flatline attack and becomes unable to move. Alita then deals him a killing blow, however, Jashugan's fighting spirit is so strong that he manages to reanimate his \\"dead\\" body through raw chi power. He stands up, attacks Alita and completely defeats her before \\"dying\\" for good. However, as the rule of the game is 'last man standing', Alita becomes the new champion after Jashugan's death. The side story \\"Sonic Finger\\" shows Alita and Jashugan's fight on TV and reveals that Alita has a poster of Jashugan on her apartment wall which she greets each morning when she is living on her own after retiring from Motorball. Twelve years after their match when Alita infiltrates Desty Nova's hideout, the Granite Inn, in search of Nova, she encounters Jashugan in a dream-sequence when she is trapped by Nova's Ouroboros program. Forced to confront her inner doubts and fears, Alita fights Jashugan again and, this time, defeats him. He congratulates her and encourages her to \\"aspire to reach heights I was unable to attain\\".Kishiro, Battle Angel Alita: Fallen Angel, page 221 Alita's victory enables her to break out of the Ouroboros and confront Nova. Kishiro has said of this second fight that Alita and Jashugan \\"had to confront each other again\\", as \\"many things had not been said\\" during their first fight. Jashugan has also appeared in Alita's thoughts in Last Order, when she was fighting Caerula Sanguis. =Alita's Challenge Team= After Hugo's death, Alita ran away from Ido. She was shortly afterwards found crying in a bar by Ed, who recruited her to become a Motorball player and signed her to a 12-race contract. When Ido finds out that she has become a Motorball player a month later, Alita has already become a popular player nicknamed the \\"Killing Angel\\", going on to win five straight races in the Third League before moving up to the Second League and picking up a sponsor, Mr. Thompson. She successfully defeats Ajakutty in a practice match over the player number 99, earning the right to wear the number in the Second League and Ajakutty's respect. After directly challenging Jashugan, Alita is only shown competing in her debut race in the Second League, from which she determines who will make up her five-man challenge team. Against Ed's wishes, she plans to quit Motorball after the challenge race with Jashugan, having completed her racing contract. In the challenge race, Jashugan successfully defeats Alita's teammates, leaving the two of them alone to duel. Forced to fight harder than she ever has before, Alita is severely damaged by Jashugan's final attack, but manages to survive him. She carries out her promise and retires from Motorball afterwards. The following players were selected by Alita to be the members of her five-man challenge team against Jashugan. Ajakutty Portrayed by Marko Zaror :League: Second :Player Number: 99/88 :Nicknames: ‚ÄúKing Crusher,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Crownless King‚Äù The original player wearing number 99 in the Second League before Alita qualified for it, Ajakutty refuses to relinquish the number to Alita, who wore it in the Third League and is determined to continue wearing it, without a fight. In a best of three rounds practice match, he wins the first round but loses the second. Recognizing Alita's superior abilities, Ajakutty forfeits the third match and relinquishes the number to Alita. She earns his respect and he becomes her closest ally in motorball. Ajakutty calls Alita ‚ÄúSister‚Äù instead of by her name, and she in turn calls him ‚ÄúAjy.‚Äù Ajakutty is a player who relishes the fight more than the win. His ranking of 23rd is thus deceptive, and he has crashed over 200 players. His fighting style is what he calls the ‚ÄúAsian Arts‚Äù, with an emphasis on kicks. Three other players, Balgerald, Skaramasakus and Halberd, are Ajakutty's disciples, and each specializes in a particular discipline. In his first race with Alita, Ajakutty takes on the Second League champion Armblessed for the first time after the latter has dispatched two of his students, and barely escapes with his life. He is the third member of the challenge team to be dispatched by Jashugan. Like Armblessed, he survives the encounter and is recovered from the track. Alita's decision to quit Motorball after the match with Jashugan leads him to label her as an outsider, as he realizes that she is not in it for the game. Armblessed :League: Second :Player Number: 1 :Nickname: ‚ÄúCaligula‚Äù The arrogant, vicious Second League champion, Armblessed is renowned for his cruelty and commands a fanatical following among his fans, who willingly offer their hands to be cut off by him and placed on his horns (the ‚ÄúHands of Victory‚Äù) as part of his pre-win ritual during races. His weapons are diamond-edged chain blades built into his arms and legs that can cut through any other player's armor. Armblessed uses his blades to deliver devastating cuts that slice his opponents vertically and horizontally. During Alita's Second League race debut, Armblessed makes short work of both Halberd and Bargerald, provoking a fight with Ajakutty. Letting the latter take his right leg, he extends a spike from his body that he uses as the basis for his Gushiken (the ‚ÄúTaiwanese Spin\\"), which makes him spin like a top along the track and slice whoever is in his way to pieces with his chain blades. After crippling Ajakutty, Armblessed gets into a fight with Alita in which his chain blades are matched up against her Damascus blades, with Alita coming out on top and Armblessed flying off the track and out of the race. Still arrogant in defeat, Armblessed is nonetheless chosen against his will to be a member of Alita's challenge team. He is the first player to be taken on by Jashugan, who, impervious to his chain blades, uses his arm rotors to tear Armblessed's body to shreds. Jashugan then uses one of Armblessed's chain blades that has been severed from him to slice Zafal Takie in two and prevent her from securing the motorball. Armblessed's head survives and he is picked up off the track along with Ajakutty by a recovery team. Zafal Takie :League: Second :Player Number: 7 :Nickname: \\"Crimson Wind\\" Zafal Takie is the only other female motorball player shown besides Alita. She relies on her speed and technique as opposed to fighting prowess to win, being skilled enough to get within speaking distance of Alita without the latter noticing until the last minute. Since her debut, she has won three straight races. In her fourth race she succeeded in maneuvering Skaramasakus off the track and into the crash area, claiming the motorball. She then challenged Alita, winning their initial confrontation and forcing Alita to pit. However, Takie lost their second confrontation when Alita returned to the track. Her performance earns her a spot on Alita's challenge team. During the challenge race, she is sliced in two by one of Armblessed's chain blades wielded by Jashugan while reaching for the motorball. It is implied that she survived because her brain remained intact, although she is not explicitly shown being picked up by a recovery crew. Tiegel :League: Second :Player Number: 50 :Nicknames: ‚ÄúThe Shame of the Second,‚Äù ‚ÄúWalking Last Place‚Äù Holding the lowest average in the Second League, Tiegel is the largest motorball player seen. Heavily armored and nearly impervious to attack, his bulk also makes him ponderously slow. Tiegel does not have any special abilities, but is very persistent. He is in love with Alita, and begs her to let him join her challenge team both on and off the track. Alita's duel with Zafal Takie during her Second League debut gives Tiegel an unexpected victory during the race, provoking a riot among the spectators and earning him a spot on the team. During the challenge race with Jashugan, he attempts to ram the champion but crashes into a wall. When pulled out by a recovery team, he revives, intervening in the fight between Jashugan and Alita just in time to prevent the former from finishing her off. This time Tiegel succeeds in slamming Jashugan into a wall, but Jashugan's attacks break through his armor, triggering a series of explosions and setting his body ablaze. His final act is to ram Jashugan into another section of the wall, expressing his lack of regret over not quitting Motorball because he had the chance to fight the champion. =OthersEsdoc (‚ÄúEd‚Äù) A former Motorball player, Ed is Alita's manager and his racing team is named Esdoc Motors. In his prime, his blade techniques were as good as Jashugan's Maschine-Klatsch and they were rivals. However, both were severely injured in an accident, from which Ed had to resort to acceleration drug injections to stay competitive. His abuse of the drug resulted in a permanent condition called ‚ÄúTerminal Frost‚Äù, which forced him to retire from motorball and makes his hands shake uncontrollably at unpredictable times, although it can be controlled with medications. Ed recruited Alita shortly after she ran away from Ido following Hugo's death, and has dreams of getting her into the top league, so he can vicariously fulfill his dream of challenging and eventually surpassing Jashugan. He is violently opposed to Alita's plans to quit motorball after her match with Jashugan, when she will have fulfilled her 12 race contract, and plans to have her contract renewed. When a junky with a homemade gun tries to kill Alita, Ed shields her, taking a fatal shot that blows off the top of his head. His last act is to give Alita her Damascus Blades that he had reforged into a single blade. Unbeknownst to Alita, Ed sold her Berserker Body, which had been in storage, while she was fitted out with her Motorball body in an attempt to keep her on the circuit. That body was later acquired by Desty Nova and fitted onto Zapan. Umba A fat, very short cyborg, Umba is an ace mechanic, responsible for repairing Alita's Motorball body as well as tuning and upgrading it. He uses a tracked harness from which he hangs suspended for increased mobility and height. When Alita is damaged following her confrontation with Takie, Umba proves that he is skilled enough to be able to absorb enough information from 15 sensors in order to control a 20 arm ‚Äúoctopus‚Äù exoskeleton, in effect performing the work of ten engineers and getting Alita back onto the track in less than six minutes. Umba has agoraphobia, and is no fun on an outing according to Esdoc. Devastated following Esdoc's death, he nevertheless does not try to dissuade Alita from her decision to quit motorball after the match with Jashugan. Two years later, Umba starts a successful engineering company with Mr. Thompson and writes to Alita about her Berserker Body, which he has managed to track down to Desty Nova after Ed sold it. Barjack The are an outlaw military force regarded as bandits by residents of the Scrapyard who remain unaware of their motive: to destroy Tiphares and with it, the Factory and the Scrapyard. Comprising Badlands dissidents who felt disenfranchized by the Tiphares-dominated system, the Barjack is predominantly a well equipped mobile ground force and is formally organized into ranks and units, although there is no formal inclusion criteria for members. Notable Barjack members include Den, the Barjack's charismatic samurai founder; Koyomi K., the rebellious daughter of the Bar Kansas owner; Knucklehead, a former bandit; B.B. Buick, a \\"special prisoner\\"; Colonel Bozzle, a former member of the Green Beret Tribe; and Kayna, a cyborg nurse. The Barjack switches to guerilla warfare after five years of fighting when their railway gun, Heng, fails to destroy Tiphares. The deployment of 11 TUNED AR units against the Barjack leaves the fate of the remaining Barjack forces uncertain in Battle Angel Alita, although the side story \\"Barjack Rhapsody\\" reveals that substantial numbers of Barjack survived and are willing to take up the cause again. =Kaos= is Desty Nova's son and a popular late-night radio host. He is extremely fragile. Kaos only sees in infrared wavelengths and hears and speaks at radio wavelengths. Those that see him in person must use special transceivers for communication. Kaos is an expert of psychometry, a unique talent to read the memories of inanimate objects. For example, he can channel the memories of a katana to learn sword skills and the memories of a computer to hack it. He and his team of molemen dig up artifacts from the bygone era, and he uses the memories contained in these artifacts as the basis for his radio show. Kaos also has a dark side in the form of Den, a manifestation of uncontrollable rage that has been with him since he was a child. Although Den exists in a physical form, he and Kaos are linked by an EPR transmitter Nova installed in Kaos' chest. =Den= is Kaos's alternate personality and appears as a giant remote-controlled slave unit run from a transmitter embedded in Kaos‚Äô chest. Den was within Kaos since he was young, and whenever this rage manifested itself, Kaos became homicidal but had no memories of what happened to him when this part of his psyche took over: Nova learned of Den when Den burst forth, nearly resulting in Nova and Bazarld's deaths, and installed a transmitter into Kaos‚Äô heart and nervous system, to make him independent of Kaos‚Äô body by providing him with a slave body (He can however, use the transmitter to take control of Kaos' body without his knowledge, and the death of Kaos will mean the death for both of them). After being created by Nova, Den went to the wasteland to find himself and train as a warrior, and found his purpose to find a suitable body to contain his rage and rule the desert. The story reveals that Den developed the firm belief that Tiphares is the source of the surface dwellers' pain and misery, and that anyone associated with Tiphares, the Factory, or the Scrapyard is corrupt, and formed the Barjack to wage war against Tiphares. He later gets fatally wounded by Factory ground forces when he charges the Scrapyard in a last attempt to attack Tiphares after the Barjack's railway gun, Heng, fails to destroy it. The side story Barjack Rhapsody reveals that two more remote-controlled bipedal bodies of Den exists: one was found by Eakins, the manager for Farm 3, who plans to revive the Barjack as a bandit organization, and the other is in the care of Geriperi, an old eccentric. These two Dens duel each other at the Barjack revival meeting, in which the second Den (operated by Geriperi) triumphs and leaves after ordering the remaining Barjack to assist in the construction of the Tower of Tiphares. Ground Investigation Bureau (GIB)Lou Collins= Lou Collins, known in Japan as , is Alita's operator who is brought in after Alita and Figure part ways. She is a bit clumsy and often gets overwhelmed by work. On her first day, she makes a bad first impression on Chief Bigott by pulling a gun on him in self-defense because she thought he planned to sexually assault her by leading her down an obscure back stairway to the GIB, and is thoroughly embarrassed when Bigott reveals that he is gay. Unbeknownst to Lou, she along with Dr. Russell was brought in by Bigott in an attempt to curb Alita's intransigence. Somewhat ditzy, Lou nevertheless has a good heart. She is a new at her job, having placed first in her class in simulations, and tries to get along with Alita. L ou provides Alita with intelligence, logistical, technical and combat support. She can also remote control the \\"mobile unit\\", a single- wheeled drone motorcycle that is issued to Alita as personal transport, as well as broadcast her voice from it. Through Alita's experiences, Lou eventually becomes her friend, and starts to develop a more sympathetic view of the world below Tiphares. She gives Kaos plans for the \\"Tower of Tiphares\\", a tower connecting Tiphares to the Scrapyard that can be constructed with the existing scrap on the surface. She also agrees to help Alita by deleting the information regarding Den and Kaos from the GIB's systems. Lou has saved Alita's life on two occasions. The first occurred while Alita was dueling Den and was almost impaled by his yari, Lou grabbed Alita out of harm's way with her remotely controlled drone motor unicycle. The second time occurred when Alita was fighting the replica android AR-2, and as Alita was about to lose the fight and be finished off, Lou threatened AR-2's operator with her pistol and shot and destroyed AR-2's control terminal, freezing AR-2 and allowing Alita to decapitate the android. Lou is consequently dismissed from the GIB and sent to the Medical Inspection Bureau (MIB) to be \\"treated\\". The knowledge of Lou's sacrifice and Bigott's promise to let her go free after apprehending Desty Nova motivate Alita to complete her original mission. When she is brought to Tiphares by Nova in her new Imaginos Body, she finds out that Lou is to be cast down from Tiphares' garbage chute for forming a friendship with a surface dweller, and manages to save her just in time. Due to her naivety, Lou is the least emotionally traumatized when the secret of Tiphares is unveiled to her, the only side effect she suffers being the cessation of her hiccups (much to her joy). She accompanies Alita and Nova to confront Melchizedek and witnesses the result of Alita's injecting her Imaginos Body with a trigger serum given by Nova, enabling her to go through a transmutation and create the Life-Tree that prevented Tiphares from crashing into the Scrapyard. Subsequently, Lou eventually marries Kaos, who she had a crush on while monitoring Alita's Badlands mission against the Barjacks. =Bigott Eizenburg= The stern, no-nonsense chief of the GIB, intervenes just before Alita's brain is destroyed for committing a Class A offense to recruit her for the TUNED project. Although the GIB has a team of operators who provide logistical, intelligence, and technical support, he personally monitors and oversees Alita's operations and actions. Alita's independent attitude and willingness to disobey orders frustrate Bigott. In order to reduce her rebelliousness, he brings in Dr. Russell and Lou Collins as people whom she can warm up to. While escorting Lou to the GIB on her first day through a back stairwell, she pulls a gun on him as she thinks that he plans to force himself on her, but Bigott reveals that he is homosexual and has no interest in her. More than a week after Alita duels Den, Bigott dismisses Dr. Russell for his opposition to replacing Alita with the TUNED AR series. When AR-2 confronts Alita, he reveals that her value to the GIB was never more than a sample for creating the perfect series of combat androids that would be totally obedient. After Alita defeats AR-2, he has her continue with her original mission of apprehending Desty Nova with the promise that she can leave the TUNED after its completion. Bigott meanwhile has the rest of the AR series conduct anti- Barjack operations, and uses the Tipharean superweapon Abaddon to destroy the Barjack's giant railway gun Heng. After Alita infiltrates the Granite Inn but gets trapped by Nova's Ouroboros program, Bigott sells her out, offering her to Nova and inviting him back to Tiphares with Melchizedek and the Ladder's approval. When the secret of Tiphares is revealed to Bigott, he slices off the top of his own head to see for himself. Seeing his own bio-chip brain, he goes insane, and is shortly after killed along with the rest of the GIB by the MIB. Bigott makes a brief appearance in the side story \\"Furusato\\" in which Alita is still a member of the TUNED. =TUNED AR Series = During her time as agent of GIB, the organization documented all of Alita's combat experiences including the Panzer-Kunst techniques. This was done without Alita's knowledge, as part of a plan to create a series of mass-produced TUNED replicas all with the abilities of Alita but fully loyal to GIB and Tiphares. Their very existence is a result of the Secret of Tiphares, as their solid- state brains are the same bio-chips that are used in Tipharean citizens. In all, 11 TUNED replicas were produced, each designated as AR, i.e., \\"Alita Replicas\\" (GR in the Japanese version, i.e., \\"Gally Replicas\\"), and numbered 2 to 12, whereas Alita herself was designated as A-1 (G-1). All TUNED replicas have or had knowledge of basic Panzer-Kunst and are able to use special attacks like the Hertza Haeon (Sechs used it in a puppet-body as well as in his Fizziroy Body) and Einzug R√ºstungen (AR-2 used it against Alita). Eventually, all but three of the 11 replicas are killed ‚Äî AR-2 is killed in combat by Alita herself, AR-10 is killed when dragged into molten metal by the cyborg dog Fury, while AR-6 goes on a killing spree and eliminated all the remaining replicas except AR-11 and AR-12. The following AR series replicas have appeared as characters that survive in Last Order.  AR-6/Sechs  appears in Last Order as the sixth 'TUNED AR/GR Series 2' robot copy of Alita/Gally. After the shut down of the GIB, the abandoned AR-6/GR-6 renamed themselves Sechs, and found new purpose through combat, hunting down and destroying the other copies. Intending to ultimately destroy Alita in single combat, surpass the original, and earn the right to exist as a real warrior. After being defeated by Alita, and having the TUNED body destroyed, Sechs is temporarily put inside of Alita's old interactive interface to use as a body. After registering for the Z.O.T.T., Sechs transitions into the anatomically male Fizziroy body, made of cutting edge polyethylene materials, and different from his initial make as a replica of Alita.  AR-11/Elf and AR-12/Zw√∂lf  and appears in Last Order as the only two TUNED units to escape Sechs' killing spree. Throughout the series they appear as cuter twin versions of Alita, supplying comic relief and craziness through personality, dress styles and fighting styles. They are seen together, acting like twins, although they call each other best friends. At first they worked as singers in Barjack City before they becoming Desty Nova's bodyguards, and eventually they enter the Zenith of Things Tournament (Z.O.T.T.) as \\"Dark Alita\\" (Zw√∂lf) and \\"White Alita\\" (Elf) of the Space Angels team. Other Hunter-warriors are bounty- hunters in the Scrapyard who are registered with the Factory. This makes them eligible to pursue wanted criminals and collect the bounties on them. Because there is no formal criminal justice system or police force in the Scrapyard, hunter-warriors function as the primary means of enforcing Factory Law. However, they themselves are still subject to Factory Law, and can become wanted criminals when they step outside its boundaries. =Figure Four= is a drifter known for his mastery of koppo, a form of martial arts that emphasizes bypassing a cyborg's armor to inflict internal damage. Originally a fisherman from the West Coast, Figure traveled east in order to see Tiphares, staying in the Scrapyard for a year, before signed up as a mercenary guarding Factory Train 12, where he befriended Yolg and became intrigued by Alita. Figure questions Alita's bloodlust and desire for battle only to realize that she cannot choose not to fight and decides to help her in her fight against the Barjack. Figure realizes that Alita likes him when he saves Alita from Knucklehead, and later admits that he loves her. He later returns to his previous life in as a fisherman in his hometown Alhambra. In the ending of the original series, Figure refuses to believe Alita is dead and spends five years searching. He encounters Kiyomi K. in Ketheres and later confronts a senile deranged Desty Nova, who leads them into a cavern where he reunites with the reborn Alita. Figure Four also appears as a side character in Last Order, travelling with Ido before reuniting with the original Alita in the form of a full-flesh human, while her brain chip-equipped cyborg counterpart travels to Mars to finish her fight with Frau X. =Fury= is one of Murdock the Dog Master's cyborg dogs, and appears to be modeled along the lines of a bloodhound. He is the only dog whom a 2 year old Koyomi latches onto as \\"Doo Fan\\", what she calls all dogs she comes across after Duke Fang. He is assigned by Murdock to protect Koyomi and Shumira when Zapan wreaks havoc on Bar New Kansas in the Berserker Body, and is thus the only one of the four dogs to escape alive. Fury stays with Koyomi and her father, joining her when she runs away at age 13 to see Kaos by hitching a ride with a caravan. Fury now spends much of his time sleeping, but he still possesses some of his old instincts, as he quickly kills one of Sentinel's bandits who is threatening Koyomi. Fury recognizes Alita when she saves Koyomi from the bandits, even though he has not seen her in 11 years. He accompanies Koyomi when she joins the Barjack, and is with her and the Heng when it fires on Tiphares. Fury realizes that AR-10 is not Alita, and after the Heng is destroyed by the Tipharean superweapon Abaddon, destroys a flock of missile bees unleashed by AR-10 on the survivors. His first attack on AR-10 when she threatens Koyomi fails, but while AR-10 is distracted by asking the GIB to switch her ammunition over to anti-personnel rounds to deal with Buick, Fury is able to grab her around the neck and use his weight to throw her into a pile of molten metal, killing her but also dying in the process.

It is served by Bescot Stadium railway station, adjacent to which is Bescot depot where locomotives are maintained. The Banks's Stadium was built in 1990 for Walsall F.C. The area is bisected by the M6 motorway, including its 'Junction 9', where it meets the A461 which leads to Pleck and Wednesbury. The River Tame also runs through the area. History Bescot was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as a carucate of waste land in the possession of the King. It was mentioned in other ancient writings under the name of 'Berkenscot' and 'Bresmundscote'. An ancient manor was then constructed in the area and first possessed by the Hillary family. In 1403, Sir Roger Hillary died and the manor was passed on to the possession of his wife, Margaret. When she died, the property was passed on to Sir John Saer de Rochford, Roger's nephew. It later passed into the possession of the Mountfort family. In 1460, the manor passed into the possession of Sir Baldwin Mountfort following the death of Sir William Mountfort. Edward Mountfort, who died in 1691, appears to be the last male heir in the family and the estate was passed on to his daughter who passed it on to her husband Jonas Slaney in 1717. By 1717, the estate was stated as having an area of . Slaney sold the estate to Richard Wilks and in 1794, the estate was purchased by Richmond Aston. During the Industrial Revolution, Bescot was dominated by the Forge Works which were owned by Edward Elwell. The works featured a tall, tapered chimney and a pool from which was extracted, called Elwell's Pool. The forge employed 300 people and manufactured spades, hoes, shovels and axes.

The university was established on July 1, 1992, and inaugurated on October 23, 1992. It bears the name of Matthias Bel, a Hungarian-Slovak Lutheran scholar of the 18th century. It comprises six faculties that differ in character and history, each retaining substantial autonomy on financial and institutional affairs. Academically, the Matej Bel University is noted for international relations, economics and mathematics. History Bansk√° Bystrica has a long tradition in schooling and culture. In the 13th century, there had already existed a parish school, later a town school. In the 17th century, a Jesuit school, as well as Evangelical grammar schools, were founded. Matthias Bel, after whom the University is named, studied and later worked as a rector at the latter. Matthias Bel, Lutheran pastor and polymath In the 1850s and 1860s, the Catholic grammar school with Slovak as a tuition language became an important center of education in the Kingdom of Hungary. In the school year 1856‚Äì57 the first Teacher‚Äôs Preparation Study was founded in Bansk√° Bystrica (Beszterceb√°nya), where Slovak language was taught together with German and Latin, thanks to the bishop ≈†tefan Moyses. In the school year 1949‚Äì50, a branch of the Faculty of Education, Slovak University of Bratislava, was established in Bansk√° Bystrica. The first higher school appeared in Bansk√° Bystrica in 1954. It was called the Higher School of Pedagogy. On September 1, 1964, the Faculty of Education was founded. In 1973, the branch of the Faculty of Commerce, University of Economics in Bratislava, was established and in 1977 transformed into the Faculty of Economics of Services and Tourism. Matej Bel University was established on July 1, 1992 after the integration of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Economics of Services and Tourism. Governance and faculties Courtyard of the Faculty of Political Science and International Relations, Matej Bel University The Matej Bel University has traditionally been a decentralized institution, with governing authority shared among its academic faculties. The Governing Council is the unicameral legislative organ of the central administration, overseeing general academic, business and institutional affairs. The rector is appointed by the council as the chief executive. Matej Bel University currently comprises six faculties: CampusAcademics=Library and collections The Matej Bel University Library System is one of the largest university-academic library systems in Slovakia, measured by number of volumes held. Establishment of the Matej Bel University Library in Bansk√° Bystrica is connected with the foundation of the Higher College of Education in Bansk√° Bystrica in 1954. In 1964, after the foundation of Faculty of Education, it became the central library of the faculty. Since January 1, 1993 the library has served as Matej Bel University Library in Bansk√° Bystrica. In the same year, the Library of the Faculty of Economy of Services and Tourism in Bansk√° Bystrica was annexed to the Central Library of the Faculty of Education. Since 1975 the Library of the Faculty of Economy of Services and Travel served as a branch of the Central Economic Library in Bratislava. In 1996 the library system was decentralized. Having regard to the Academic Senate of the University of Matej Bel. The Matej Bel University Library system was abolished on April 1, 1996, and four new libraries were established, those were directly controlled by the faculties. This changed on January 1, 2000, when the Rector UMB Library act of 2000 entered into force, this connected the decentralized libraries of the faculties into the \\"Matej Bel University Library system. International Partnership Cooperation of the University with other Universities and Institutions is widespread and involves many national and international organizations e.g. University of Bologna in Italy, Waseda University in Japan, Moscow State University in Russia, Sogang University in South Korea, Indiana University in USA, etc. Today, Matej Bel University has 35 partnerships worldwide, apart from these agreements, the faculties have also signed agreements on cooperation based on the specific needs of their own, or their departments, totaling the number of partnerships to more than 80.

The BI discipline was created in Germany (in German: Wirtschaftsinformatik). It is an established academic discipline including bachelor, master, diploma and PhD programs in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, The Netherlands, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and is establishing in an increasing number of other countries as well as Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Malaysia, Poland and Mexico. Business informatics as an integrative discipline BI shows similarities to information systems (IS), which is a well-established discipline originating from North America. However, there are a few differences that make business informatics a unique own discipline: # Business informatics includes information technology, like the relevant portions of applied computer science, to a larger extent than information systems do. # Business informatics includes significant construction and implementation-oriented elements. I.e. one major focus lies in the development of solutions for business problems rather than the ex post investigation of their impact. Information systems (IS) focuses on empirically explaining the phenomena of the real world. IS has been said to have an \\"explanation-oriented\\" focus in contrast to the \\"solution-oriented\\" focus that dominates BI. IS researchers make an effort to explain the phenomena of acceptance and influence of IT in organizations and the society applying an empirical approach. In order to do that usually qualitative and quantitative empirical studies are conducted and evaluated. In contrast to that, BI researchers mainly focus on the creation of IT solutions for challenges they have observed or assumed and thereby they focus more on the possible future uses of IT. Tight integration between research and teaching following the Humboldtian ideal is another goal in business informatics. Insights gained in actual research projects become part of the curricula quite fast since most researchers are also lecturers at the same time. The pace of scientific and technological progress in BI is quite rapid, therefore subjects taught are under permanent reconsideration and revision. In its evolution, the BI discipline is fairly young. Therefore, significant hurdles have to be overcome in order to further establish its vision.  Career prospects  Specialists in Business Informatics can work both in research and in commerce. In business, there are various uses, which may vary depending on professional experience. Fields of employment may include: * Consulting * (Information) System Development * Sales * Systems Analysis and Organization In consulting, a clear line must be drawn between strategic as well as IT consulting.

Most often this is a station identification (required by the broadcasting authority such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission), but is also commonly used for television or radio advertisements, or a weather or traffic report. A digital on-screen graphic (\\"dog\\" or \\"bug\\"), commonly a translucent watermark, may also be keyed (superimposed) with a television station ID over the network feed using a character generator using genlock. In cases where individual broadcast stations carry programs separate from those shown on the main network, this is known as regional variation (in the United Kingdom) or an opt-out (in Canada and the United States). Automated local insertion used to be triggered with in-band signaling, such as DTMF tones or sub-audible sounds (such as 25 Hz), but is now done with out-of-band signaling, such as analog signal subcarriers via communications satellite, or now more commonly via digital signals; broadcast automation equipment can then handle these automatically. In an emergency, such as severe weather, local insertion may also occur instantly through command from another network or other source (such as the Emergency Alert System or First Warning). In this case, the most urgent warning messages may interrupt without delay, while others may be worked into a normal break in programming within 15 minutes of their initial issuance. Within individual programs In the United States, insertion can easily be heard every evening on the nationally syndicated radio show Delilah, where the host does a pre- recorded station-specific voiceover played over a music bed from the network. When host Delilah Rene says \\"this is Delilah\\", her voice (often in a slightly different tone or mood than what she has just been speaking) then identifies the branding or identification for the specific station (for example, \\"on B98.5 FM\\" when heard on WSB-FM in Atlanta, Georgia). Because of this slight difference in vocal quality, many syndicated radio networks suggest using only one voice for local station IDs 24/7; this way, the difference in vocal intonation is lessened. Insertion is made conspicuous when, due to carelessness, or even abuse‚Äîe.g. to squeeze in one more ad‚Äîthe network program is already underway by the time the insert closes. The other more prominent example is during live sports programming carried over radio and television networks, where close to the top of the hour, a play-by-play announcer will say \\"we pause ten seconds for station identification; this is the (team name) (radio network branding)\\", or a close equivalent. On most stations, this is a basic station identification, as required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), with the call letters and city of license relayed, while on others a quickly-read five second advertisement or program promotion is read before the identification, or a breaking news event or weather warning occurring during the event is relayed, followed by the station ID. Due to many sports rights deals for televised sports moving to regional sports networks which are not required to identify themselves under FCC guidelines, or network sports coverage where the station is identified through an on-screen display by the local station rather than speech, this is more prominent on radio rather than television. Local commercial (and some non-commercial) broadcast television stations also insert local commercial breaks during programming each half-hour while network-supplied or syndicated content is being broadcast. Television networks and syndication distributors give their affiliates either 60, 90 or 120 seconds each half-hour (typically totaling about four minutes per hour) to run local station breaks, including promos for the station and advertisements for national and local area businesses (and on a few stations, local news updates ‚Äì which were particularly common during the 1970s through the 1990s, especially as the \\"24 Hour News Source\\" format became commonplace in the United States during the latter decade ‚Äì current time and temperature information, or a brief local weather forecast), over network programming. Typically, these networks air a blank feed showing the network's logo (such as with Fox, NBC and The CW) or a series of public service announcements (as with ABC and CBS), while stations air local commercials. PBS member stations and other non-commercial educational stations also insert promos for network series and/or syndicated or locally produced programming during promo breaks; as these station are non-commercial, breaks are typically not featured during the programs themselves, instead promos are inserted in- between shows, even ‚Äì in the case of PBS members ‚Äì if the station is carrying the national network feed. Various television morning news shows (such as Good Morning America and Today) also allocate five minutes of programming time each half-hour for stations to carry a local news update (which sometimes run as little as three minutes) at :25 and :55 minutes past the hour; however the national feed continues for stations that do not wish to \\"break away\\", either because they do not air a morning newscast or simply do not have a news department (for example, some mid-sized and smaller market NBC affiliates, such as KTEN in Ada, Oklahoma, do not air news cut-ins during the weekend edition of Today if they do not have a weekend morning newscast, but cut-ins are shown during the weekday telecasts where Today follows a morning newscast). This also occurs with news on NPR's Morning Edition and All Things Considered, which respectively air during the morning and evening rush hours. Starting in the early 1990s, some cable television systems began carrying a local insert called \\"Local Edition\\", a segment featuring local news inserts (which are produced by area television stations or local cable operators) that air at :24 and :54 minutes past the hour during HLN's rolling daytime news block, usually during the network's non-essential features news block. This has been discontinued as that network has switched to a general news/talk format beginning in 2005. Transmitter identification Translator stations may also have local insertion, though this is generally limited to identifying the repeating station's callsign and community of license separate from its parent station. In the United States, the FCC also allows up to 30 seconds each hour for fundraising to keep the translator service on the air. Pay television Local insertion is also used by cable and telephone company television providers, in which cable and telco headends insert advertisements for the system, promotions for programs on other cable channels carried by the provider and commercials for local area businesses (such as car dealerships or furniture stores) at least twice each hour; unlike most commercial broadcast stations, however, cable channels often run only 60 seconds of local commercial inserts each half-hour near the end of the first or second commercial break and are aired in place of national ads or network promos that air during that given time. Direct-broadcast satellite services cannot locally insert content during commercial breaks, so viewers are either able to see ads or promos that are covered up by the local content on cable or see a DBS provider's own promotions. Local insertion on cable television is used especially on The Weather Channel in the U.S. and The Weather Network/M√©t√©oM√©dia in Canada, where systems like the WeatherStar, IntelliStar and PMX have been used to show regularly scheduled local weather forecasts (known as \\"Local on the 8s\\" on The Weather Channel in the U.S.), and well as the lower display line (LDL) or lower-third graphic that is shown at other times. The Weather Channel, in particular also airs ads during national breaks at the end of some advertisements allowing its WeatherSTAR or IntelliSTAR systems to insert selected locations for certain businesses operating in the area, such as restaurants or auto rental dealers; though The Weather Channel has not done this as much in recent years as they have in the past. This only applies to the cable systems, although in the U.S. direct-broadcast satellite services have shown an LDL of the current conditions and 12-hour forecast for select major cities. This is not seen on older TVRO or \\"big ugly dish\\" systems, as this is intended as a backhaul and has very few end-users, and is used as a clean feed. Set-top boxes In place of the IntelliSTAR, a hyperlocal form of insertion is now done on DirecTV (and possibly other DBS services), whereby the first half of the local forecast is generated by the set-top box. A \\"cutout\\" at the upper right corner of the picture allows the sponsor's advertising logo to be shown live from the main video feed, while a datacast on the satellite (like that which provides the electronic program guide) sends simple forecast and conditions data for the entire country every couple of minutes. Graphics are stored on the receiver, and displayed according to the forecast, which is selected by ZIP code or city according to user settings. Additionally, starting in 2011, DirecTV users with digital video recorders will have commercials downloaded to their boxes, which will play according to their demographic information, likely commanding higher revenue from advertisers. This may eventually lead to or merge with interactive television, which may find more success on cable and telco television because of the lack of a return channel on satellite and broadcast. Internet-connected TVs may erode this barrier as well, however, with only their embedded flash memory chip necessary to hold short video clips.

It causes increased levels of amniotic fluid during pregnancy (polyhydramnios) and intestinal obstruction in newborn babies. Radiography shows a distended stomach and distended duodenum, which are separated by the pyloric valve, a finding described as the double-bubble sign. Treatment includes suctioning out any fluid that is trapped in the stomach, providing fluids intravenously, and surgical repair of the intestinal closure. Presentation=Complications Prognosis is usually very good, although complications are more likely to occur when there are serious congenital anomalies. Late complications may occur in about 12 percent of patients with duodenal atresia, and the mortality rate for these complications is 6 percent. Associated conditions Approximately 20‚Äì40 percent of all infants with duodenal atresia have Down syndrome and 50% have a congenital cardiac anomaly. Approximately 8% of infants with Down syndrome have duodenal atresia. Diagnosis The diagnosis of duodenal atresia is usually confirmed by radiography. An X-ray of the abdomen shows two large air filled spaces, the so-called \\"double bubble\\" sign. The air is trapped in the stomach and proximal duodenum, which are separated by the pyloric sphincter, creating the appearance of two bubbles visible on x-ray. Since the closure of the duodenum is complete in duodenal atresia, no air is seen in the distal duodenum.Atresias occurring distal to the duodenum are usually caused by vascular accidents or ischemic insult, such as jejunoileal atresia. Physical examination During pregnancy, duodenal atresia is associated with increased amniotic fluid in the uterus, which is called polyhydramnios. This increase in amniotic fluid is caused by the inability of the fetus to swallow the amniotic fluid and absorb it in their digestive tract. After birth, duodenal atresia may cause abdominal distension, especially of the upper abdomen. Bilious or non bilious vomiting, depending on the position of the atresia in relation to the Ampulla of Vater, commonly occurs within the first day of life. Treatment Early treatment includes removing fluids from the stomach via a nasogastric tube, and providing fluids intravenously. The definitive treatment for duodenal atresia is surgery (duodenoduodenostomy or duodenojejunostomy), which may be performed openly or laparoscopically. The surgery is required but not immediately urgent - a 24 to 48-hour delay is permissible to facilitate transport, further evaluation and fluid resuscitation. The initial repair has a 5 percent morbidity and mortality rate. Epidemiology Duodenal atresia occurs in 1 in every 5,000‚Äì10,000 live births.

She died aged 20, three days after giving birth to a daughter who died in 1748. Infanta of Spain Born at the Royal Alcazar of Madrid in Spain, she was the second daughter of King Philip V of Spain and Princess Elisabeth Farnese. Baptised Mar√≠a Teresa Antonia Rafaela she was an Infanta of Spain (infanta de Espa√±a) by birth and was granted the style of address of Royal Highness. She was known as Mar√≠a Teresa Rafaela though sometimes just Maria Teresa.Portrait of Marie Th√©r√®se Rapha√´lle in circa 1745 by Daniel Klein the youngerPrior to her marriage, the Spanish and French royal courts had been on poor terms: the Spanish had been greatly insulted by the French in 1725 when the engagement between Louis XV of France and Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain, elder sister of Maria Teresa, was broken off. Louis XV had instead married Marie Leszczy≈Ñska and by her fathered the Dauphin, Louis. The marriage between the Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa Rafaela and the Dauphin was announced in August 1739 after the marriage of Princess Louise √âlisabeth of France (sister of the dauphin) and Infante Felipe of Spain (brother of Mar√≠a Teresa Rafaela) the same month. Under the influence of her mother Elisabeth Farnese, Mar√≠a Teresa Rafaela was not to go to France until she reached a more mature age.Armstrong, p 343 Dauphine of France The Infanta was married to the dauphin by proxy in Madrid on 18 December 1744 and departed Spain in January 1745. She arrived at Versailles on 21 February 1745. The official marriage took place at the Palace of Versailles on 23 February 1745 and was performed by the Cardinal de Rohan. In France she was known as Marie Th√©r√®se Rapha√´lle d'Espagne or de Bourbon. The marriage was intended to improve relations between the cousin courts of France and Spain; during the infancy of Louis XV, he had been engaged to Maria Anna Victoria of Spain, oldest daughter of Philip V of Spain. The betrothal had been broken off and relations between the two countries had been cold. This latest union was meant to improve links between them both. Addressed as Madame la Dauphine at Versailles, Maria Teresa Rafaela was the highest ranking female in the kingdom after Queen Marie. She was the first Dauphine since the 1712 death of Marie Ad√©la√Øde of Savoy. On 24 February the \\"Ball of the Clipped Yew\\" was held in honor of the newlyweds. The event also marked the arrival of Madame de Pompadour at Versailles. The ball was attended by the king, the queen, Madame Henriette, Madame Ad√©la√Øde; the Duchess of Chartres the Dowager Princess of Conti and the Duchess of Modena along with other princesses of the Blood. The Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa Rafaela of Spain, future Dauphine of France by Louis Michel Van Loo (Palace of Versailles) The marriage did not get off on a good start as it was not consummated on the first night. This was a major embarrassment to the young dauphine and as a result her position at court was undermined. Despite this, she had a good relationship with the king and queen, and her husband fell quickly in love with her. Although the dauphine was described as beautiful, dignified, pious, and well educated, negative remarks were made because of her red hair. Her shy nature further isolated her from the court and she was openly hostile to the king for his affair with Madame de Pompadour. The Dauphin and Dauphine disliked the royal mistress for the way she drew attention away from Queen Marie Leszczy≈Ñska.Mitford, p 45 Finally, the marriage was consummated in September 1745, ending court gossip. The couple became very close and devoted to each other spending most of their time together. On 19 July 1746 at Versailles, Marie Th√©r√®se Rapha√´lle gave birth to a daughter. Her death on 22 July caused an intense sorrow to the Dauphin, which persisted into his second marriage. Louis XV had to physically drag his son away from the death bed of his wife. To make matters worse the Dauphine's Father King Philip V of Spain died just 13 days before her on July 9.Mitford, p 80 The child was baptised Marie Th√©r√®se and was styled as Madame Royale but died at Versailles in 1748.Emmanuel, p 101 Marie Th√©r√®se Rapha√´lle was buried at the Royal Basilica of Saint Denis, the French royal necropolis outside Paris on 6 August 1746. At her death, her half brother, Ferdinand VI of Spain, proposed that the Dauphin marry her sister the Infanta Maria Antonia Fernanda but Louis XV refused.Emmanuel, p 124 The following year, her husband married again to Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony a daughter of Augustus III of Poland and Maria Josepha of Austria by whom he had some seven children including the future Louis XVI. When the Dauphin died in 1765, he requested that his heart be placed beside the grave of Marie Th√©r√®se Rapha√´lle. Issue #Princess Marie Th√©r√®se of France (19 July 1746 - 27 April 1748).

He was the author, with Christian Friedrich Ecklon, of Enumeratio Plantarum Africae Australis (1835-7), a descriptive catalogue of South African plants. In 1816 Zeyher was apprenticed to his uncle Johann Michael Zeyher who was head gardener at the ducal gardens of Schwetzingen. Here he met Franz Sieber and was talked into a partnership with the aim of collecting and selling natural history specimens - a burgeoning industry in the 19th century. They sailed for Mauritius in August 1822, however Zeyher was left at the Cape while Sieber went on to Mauritius and Australia. On his return in April 1824, Sieber picked up the specimens collected by Zeyher, assuring him of payment in due course. No payment ever materialised and Zeyher became aware that he would be forced to operate on his own. He journeyed east to Uitenhage in 1825 and north beyond Clanwilliam in 1828. The resulting specimens were sent to his uncle at Schwetzingen. In 1829 Ecklon returned to the Cape from Europe where he had sold his specimens through the Unio Itineraria run by Christian Ferdinand Friedrich Hochstetter (1787-1860) and Ernst Gottlieb von Steudel (1783-1856) at Esslingen. Zeyher and Ecklon decided to collaborate in their collecting. Ecklon sailed for Algoa Bay to collect in the Eastern Cape and Zeyher travelled north by ox-wagon. Zeyher's route took him through the Clanwilliam and Cederberg area, from where he followed the Olifants River to its mouth. Here Zeyher ran across Drege on 23 May 1831. He collected in the area for some time, travelling on to Bitterfontein and the Kamiesberge. From here he went further north up to the Orange River, eventually reaching its mouth. Little rain had fallen and the landscape was parched, causing considerable losses among his oxen. In the meanwhile Ecklon had returned to Cape Town from his trip, and put some work into his collection while awaiting Zeyher. They met up again at Tulbagh, where they scaled the mountains in the area as well as going up the Groot Winterhoekberg, gathering a rich collection of plants.  Expedition to Kaffraria 1831-32  Ecklon and Zeyher left Cape Town in October 1831 on a collecting trip to the eastern borders of the Cape Colony. Passing through Caledon they went down to Cape Agulhas and back to Swellendam, where they once again came across Drege on 5 November 1831. Crossing the Langeberg into the Karoo, they collected extensively along the Gourits River and the Swartberg. Turning south again they crossed the Outeniqua Mountains, visiting George and Knysna, before following the Langkloof to Uitenhage and Algoa Bay, from where they shipped their collection back to Cape Town. Travelling further north through the Albany and Somerset East districts, then east over the Fish, Koonap and Kat Rivers, and again north over the Winterberg, they came to Tamboekieland in the area of the present Queenstown. From here they followed the Kei River to its source in the Stormberg. By this time their collections had grown so large that Ecklon was detailed to leave for Europe in 1832 to dispose of the specimens. Zeyher remained in Tamboekieland since Drege notes that he met him at Shiloh Mission south of Queenstown on 29 November 1832. Zeyher then returned to Uitenhage where he found employment in the service of Joachim Brehm, an apothecary and collector who had created one of the finest gardens in the Eastern Cape. At this time Ecklon was in Hamburg seeing to the publication of their joint paper Enumeratio Plantarum Africae Australis which appeared in three parts between 1834 and 1837. Apparently Ecklon's visit to Hamburg was cut short by a warehouse fire that destroyed the greater part of their collections. Financially Ecklon was crippled and sold his personal set of specimens to Sonder before returning to the Cape in late 1837 or early 1838. He lived for another 30 years, but his mental and physical strength had been broken by the setbacks and he ceased collecting. Zeyher had in turn become dispirited by events, and had struck out on his own before Ecklon's return. He went back to the Uitenhage area and forwarded his new collections to WJ Hooker and N. B. Ward of London. While in Uitenhage, Zeyher had put together an extensive collection of indigenous wood samples together with flowering and fruiting herbarium specimens. These were destined for the Berlin Museum and a favourable price had been agreed upon. Misfortune continued to haunt Zeyher, however, and the ship carrying this precious collection was lost at sea. Expedition to the interior with Joseph Burke 1840-1842 (see under Joseph Burke) Zeyher is commemorated in the genera Zeyheria Mart., Zeyherella (Engl.) Aubr√®v. & Pellegr. and in a large number of specific names. His personal herbarium is at the South African Museum, though Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Pappe (1803-1862) replaced most of the labels with his own.

It is at the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers, where the Ohio River is formed. Fort Pitt Museum is surrounded by Point State Park, a Pennsylvania state park named for the geographically and historically significant point that is between the rivers. This piece of land was key to controlling the upper reaches of the Ohio River Valley and western Pennsylvania, before, during and after the French and Indian War as well as the American Revolution. The museum is in a recreated bastion of Fort Pitt, which was originally built in 1758 by the British. An outline of Fort Duquesne is nearby. The historical focus of the museum is the role that Fort Pitt played during the French and Indian War. The museum also features detailed information on Fort Pitt's role during the American Revolution, the Whiskey Rebellion and the founding of Pittsburgh. The museum was established and operated by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission until its closure in August 2009 from state budget cuts. The Heinz Center took over operation of the museum and reopened it in April 2010. History Fort Pitt was a fort in what is now the city of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The fort was built in 1758 during the French and Indian War, next to the site of Fort Duquesne. The French built Fort Duquesne at the beginning of that war, and it became a focal point due to its strategic river location. The Braddock expedition, a 1755 attempt to take Fort Duquesne, met with a bloody repulse at the Monongahela River. The French garrison viciously mauled an attacking British regiment in September 1758, but abandoned and destroyed the fort at the approach of General John Forbes's expedition in November. The Forbes expedition was successful where the Braddock expedition had failed because of the Treaty of Easton, in which area American Indians agreed to abandon their alliance with the French. American Indians--primarily Delawares and Shawnees--made this agreement with the understanding that the British military would leave the area after the war. The Indians wanted a trading post on the spot, but they did not want a British army garrison. The British, however, built a new fort on the site and named it Fort Pitt, after William Pitt the Elder. \\"A Plan of the New Fort at Pitts- Burgh\\", drawn by cartographer John Rocque and published in 1765. \\"Fort Pitt in 1795\\", from Durant's 1876 \\"History of Allegheny County\\" Blockhouse. Part of the excavated fort. As a result, in 1763 local Delawares and Shawnees took part in Pontiac's Rebellion, an effort to drive the British out of their territory. The Indians' siege of Fort Pitt began on June 22, 1763, but the fort was too strong to be taken by force. In negotiations during the siege, the commander of Fort Pitt gave two Delaware emissaries blankets that had been exposed to smallpox, in hopes of infecting the surrounding Indians and ending the siege. The effectiveness of this attempt is unclear. Outbreaks of smallpox had plagued Native Americans for years before, during and after the Fort Pitt attempt, killing much of the Native American population. On August 1, 1763, most of the Indians broke off the siege in order to intercept an approaching force under Colonel Henry Bouquet, resulting in the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet fought off the attack and relieved Fort Pitt on August 10. After Pontiac's War, Fort Pitt was no longer necessary to the British Crown, and was abandoned to the locals in 1772. At that time, the Pittsburgh area was claimed by both Virginia and Pennsylvania, and a power struggle for the region commenced. Virginians took control of Fort Pitt, and for a brief while in the 1770s it was called Fort Dunmore, in honour of Virginia's Governor Lord Dunmore. The fort served as a staging ground in Dunmore's War of 1774. During the American Revolutionary War, Fort Pitt served as a headquarters for the western theatre of the war. Fort Pitt fell into disrepair once again in the years following the Revolution. It was abandoned in 1792 when Fort Fayette was built to replace it. Residents of the growing Pittsburgh used the remnants of the fort to build permanent housing for themselves. A small brick building called the Blockhouse‚Äîactually a type of outbuilding known as a redoubt‚Äîremains in Point State Park, the only intact remnant of Fort Pitt. It was erected in 1764, and is believed to be the oldest building, not only in Pittsburgh, but in western Pennsylvania. Used for many years as a home, the blockhouse was purchased and has been preserved for many years by the Daughters of the American Revolution, who make it open to the public. Part of the foundations of Fort Pitt have been excavated and some of the fort has been rebuilt, though, giving visitors to Point State Park a sense of the size of the fort. In this rebuilt section the Monongahela Bastion houses the Fort Pitt Museum. Fort Pitt Foundry was an important armaments manufacturing center for the Federal government during the Civil War, under the charge of William Metcalf. Museum Michael DeBerardinis, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, announced a $25 million plan to renovate Point State Park and parts of the Fort Pitt Museum on October 11, 2006. The plans call for improving the green spaces within the park, expanding recreational opportunities, preserving historical installations and updating outdated amenities. The project was originally scheduled to be complete within four years, with the majority of the work to be completed in time for Pittsburgh's 250th anniversary celebration in 2008. Sections of the park have fallen into disuse since it was established in 1974. The homeless have used the trenches surrounding the foundations of the remains of Fort Pitt as a temporary shelter for years. Graffiti on the structures of the park has become a major problem. Sections of the park are littered with fence posts, cut logs, plastic drums, and rolled up snow drift fencing. The walkways have become cracked and are beginning to fall apart. The goal of the restoration project is to re-establish the park as a recreational destination. Plans for improving the park are well under way. They include, installing new pumps and pipes in the fountain, establishing a seating area around the fountain and a wading area for children, restoring the river walk with steps that lead into the river, building kiosks for information and concessions, renovating the rest rooms, renovating the water taxi landings and surrounding docks, and installing wireless internet access hubs. Currently (April 2011) the waterfront area is closed to pedestrians as the stone walkways and wharf area are being resurfaced. They are to be reopened during the summer, 2011.http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/parks/point.aspx These plans were not put into place without some controversy. On January 25, 2007, thirteen members of two different local labor unions were arrested for blocking access by contractors to the work sites at the remnants of Fort Pitt. The labor union protested the use of four non labor workers by the contractor responsible for completing the work at Point State Park. On August 14, 2009, the state closed the museum and three other PHMC museums indefinitely due to a lack of funding as part of an ongoing budget crisis. Management of the museum is supposed to be taken over by the Senator John Heinz Regional History Center once the state budget is passed. The Senator John Heinz History Center re-opened the Fort Pitt Museum on Saturday, April 17, 2010. The History Center's museum system also includes a Smithsonian-affiliated, seven-story museum in Pittsburgh's Strip District; Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village, the oldest site of human habitation in North America located in Avella, Pa.; and the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, a two-floor museum-within-a-museum at the History Center. Currently, the Fort Pitt Museum is open to visitation seven days a week from 10am - 5pm. The museum is closed only on major holidays (Christmas, New Years, Thanksgiving and Easter)http://www.heinzhistorycenter.org/secondary.aspx?id=296 References Notes Sources *O'Meara, Walter.

Apple Creek, Fredericksburg, Holmesville, and Mt. Eaton high schools were merged to create Waynedale High School within the Southeast Local School District. They have been members of the Wayne County Athletic League since their creation, as their preceding schools were beforehand. A 20-member committee of coaches, students, and teachers chose the name \\"Waynedale\\", as well as the nickname \\"Bears\\" over the other choices of \\"Warriors\\" and \\"Wabbits\\". When the school colors of brown and gold were selected, they decided to go with the nickname of \\"Golden Bears.\\" The Waynedale student section during athletic events is called the \\"Bear Den\\". Waynedale has a strong rivalry with the Triway High School Titans that dates back to when both schools were members of the WCAL from 1955-1970.

All three schools have combined to either share or outright win the WCAL football title 43 times from 1955-2015, and in that time frame there have only been 18 seasons where none of the three have contributed to a football championship.Wayne County Athletic League#League championships Ohio High School Athletic Association State Championships *Wrestling: Division III 2012 ReferencesExternal links * District Website High schools in Wayne County, Ohio Public high schools in Ohio ","title":"Waynedale High School"},{"id":"9634500","text":"William Forrest \\"Wild Bill\\" Hutchinson (December 17, 1859 ‚Äì March 19, 1926) was an American professional baseball player.

The New Zealand plant at Petone opened 17 February 1932. It made Rover 10-25 cars from local materials and used imported steel panels and hide for the upholstery. Searle did not return to Rover. Rover announced strengthening of the Family Ten chassis by using heavier gauge material and re-designed cross members to improve torsional rigidity. These improvements were, they said, the outcome of lengthy testing on New Zealand's and Australia's roughest roads carried out to make the cars suitable for overseas use. Petrol was now supplied from the tank by Autovac. A four-speed gearbox with quiet third was standard on the de luxe car and optional on the others. Brakes and springing had also been improved.

Startix was activated when the ignition was switched on and, in addition, operated automatically if the engine stalled. The new change-speed system meant gears might be changed after a slight easing of the accelerator without using the clutch yet making no noise. A knob on the instrument panel switched of the freewheel and returned the gearbox to orthodox. The half-elliptic spring on both axles are controlled by hydraulic shock-absorbers.

It was the first car to be developed by Rover after the Wilks brothers Spencer and younger brother Maurice joined the company. The car was relatively expensive at GBP238 - the Austin 10 was GBP168 - and reflected the new company policy of moving upmarket rather than chasing volume.

The Guardian, 30 January 2012. was a British studio potter, advocate for LGBT rights and writer on arts and crafts. Biography Born in Pilsley, North East Derbyshire, Cooper studied at the University for the Creative Arts. He also achieved a PhD degree at Middlesex University. He was a member of the Crafts Council and the editor of Ceramic Review. Since 1999, he was visiting Professor of Ceramics and Glass at the Royal College of Art. He was the author of many books on ceramics, including his definitive biography of Bernard Leach that was published in 2003 (Yale University Press), and was also the editor of The Ceramics Book, published in 2006. In the early 1970s, he was also a cofounder of the Gay Left collective, and remained a prominent LGBT rights campaigner throughout his life. He also published several studies of LGBT art, including The Sexual Perspective and Fully Exposed: The Male Nude in Photography. As a potter, Cooper's work falls into one of two general forms. In the first his vessels are heavily glazed in a volcanic form. The vessels, as a result of this heavy glazing, derive a lot of their appeal from their varied and uneven textures. In their most simple form they are very reminiscent of work by Lucie Rie. In their more extravagant forms though the vessels can be banded or use incredibly vivid colors to great effect including pink, vibrant yellow and deep reds and blues. His other form of work is much simpler in style using plain glazes, often in egg yolk yellow, occasionally spotted with gold flecks. His work can be found in the Victoria & Albert Museum, the National Museum of Scotland and the Philadelphia Museum of Art, as well as in many private collections. He was awarded an OBE for services to art in 2002. Cooper died on 21 January 2012.

These services are provided throughout the United States, or overseas, depending upon where the surviving children reside. Operation The foundation is a top-rated, non-profit organization located in Tampa, Florida. The SOWF supports America's special operations forces by providing full college educations to the surviving children of dead special operations personnel as well as immediate financial assistance to severely wounded special operations personnel. Today, the foundation has 1,000 children in its program, with 140 students enrolled full- time in colleges and universities across the country. Mission The foundation provides full financial assistance for a post-secondary degree from an accredited two or four-year college, university, technical, or trade school; and offers family and educational counseling, including in-home tutoring, to the surviving children of Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps special operations personnel who lose their lives in the line of duty. It also provides immediate financial assistance to severely wounded and hospitalized special operations personnel. Awards In 2017, the foundation was awarded its twelfth consecutive four-star rating from the US's leading charity watchdog, Charity Navigator. This esteemed rating places the SOWF in the top one percent of charities rated for its financial efficiency. History The SOWF was founded in 1980 following the failed attempt to rescue American hostages being held in Iran. The doomed mission was plagued with problems from the start, but it ended in disaster when a helicopter and C-130 gunship collided in the desert of Iran, at a location now referred to as \\"Desert One,\\" killing eight military personnel and severely incapacitating another. The fallen warriors left behind 17 children. The survivors took it on themselves to provide college educations for the children of their fallen comrades. The foundation began as the Col. Arthur D. \\"Bull\\" Simons Scholarship Fund. It was named in honor of the Army Green Beret, Bull Simons, who repeatedly risked his life on rescue missions. Following creation of the United States Special Operations Command, and as casualties mounted from actions such as Operations Urgent Fury (Grenada), Just Cause (Panama), Desert Storm (Kuwait and Iraq), and Restore Hope (Somalia), the Bull Simons Fund gradually expanded its outreach program to encompass all Special Operations Forces. Thus, in 1995 the Family Liaison Action Group (established to support the families of the 53 Iranian hostages) and the Spectre (Air Force gunship) Association Scholarship Fund merged to form the Special Operations Warrior Foundation. In 1998 the foundation extended the scholarship and financial aid counseling to also include training fatalities since the inception of the foundation in 1980. This action immediately added 205 children who were now eligible for college funding. Financial requirements There are more than 1,100 children of fallen special operations troops with whom the foundation is charged with helping in their education requirements. With nearly 150 children eligible each year for college in the upcoming years, the foundation's estimated financial need, as determined by a third-party actuarial firm, is $146 million. Last year, the foundation provided $4.8 million in scholarship grants, financial aid, and counseling to families of fallen special operations personnel.

Position papers are published in academia, in politics, in law and other domains. The goal of a position paper is to convince the audience that the opinion presented is valid and worth listening to. Ideas for position papers that one is considering need to be carefully examined when choosing a topic, developing an argument, and organizing the paper. Position papers range from the simplest format of a letter to the editor, through to the most complex in the form of an academic position paper., \\"The simplest form is the letter to the editor... The most complex type of position paper is the academic position paper in which arguments and evidence are presented to support the writer's views.\\" Position papers are also used by large organizations to make public the official beliefs and recommendations of the group.An example of a position paper published by an organization:  In academia  Position papers in academia enable discussion on emerging topics without the experimentation and original research normally present in an academic paper. Commonly, such a document will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.  In politics  Position papers are most useful in contexts where detailed comprehension of another entity's views is important; as such, they are commonly used by political campaigns,, \\"Through the use of position papers, telephone briefings, audio and video tapes and personal appearances Newt was able to share his ideas, ... .\\" government organizations, in the diplomatic world,, \\"..., writing position papers and talking points, ... are examples of non-classified work which is carried out at virtually every diplomatic post.\\" and in efforts to change values (e.g. through public service announcements) and organisational branding., \\"Another special area is the use of position papers as the locus for image ads and public service announcements (PSAs) for an organization.\\" They are also an important part of the Model United Nations process, and are used in the European Union. In government, a position paper lies on somewhere between a white paper and a green paper in that they affirm definite opinions and propose solutions but may not go so far as detailing specific plans for implementation.  In law  In international law, the term for a position paper is Aide-m√©moire. An Aide-M√©moire is memorandum setting forth the minor points of a proposed discussion or disagreement, used especially in undiplomatic communications.

He was a nephew of Lord Beaverbrook. Early life and family Aitken was born on 10 June 1905, the son of Joseph Mauns Aitken of Toronto.Stenton and Lees Who's Who of British Members of Parliament vol. iv p. 3 He was educated at Upper Canada College, the oldest independent school in Canada, and went on to the University of Toronto,\\"Aitken, Sir William Traven\\", Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920‚Äì2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Society. In the late 1920s he travelled through Canada and the United States, before settling in England in 1930. In 1938 he married Penelope Loader Maffey, daughter of Sir John Maffey (later Lord Rugby, and a leading civil servant); they had one son and one daughter.Stenton and Lees Who's Who of British Members of Parliament vol. iv p. 3 Wartime service He found a living as a financial journalist on the staff of the Evening Standard. When the Second World War broke out, Aitken joined the Royal Air Force and piloted fighter reconnaissance aircraft; he was severely injured in 1945 and invalided out. His son Jonathan Aitken, later a politician, was born in 1942, and his daughter Maria Aitken, later an actress, was born in 1945. Penelope Aitken became a leading socialite in post-war society. His grandson, Jack Davenport, became an actor. Career At the 1945 general election, Aitken was the Conservative Party candidate who attempted to recapture West Derbyshire; he lost by only 156 votes. He became instead Manager of London Express News and Feature Services while he searched for another Parliamentary nomination. He was also a director of Shop Investments Ltd and Western Ground Rents Ltd, both of which were property investment companies.  Parliament  In 1948, Aitken was adopted as Conservative candidate for Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, in succession to Geoffrey Clifton-Brown who was standing down. At the 1950 general election, Aitken was elected by 4,129 votes. In Parliament, Aitken showed a particular interest in Commonwealth issues, and was elected Vice- Chairman of the Conservative Commonwealth Affairs Committee. In 1951 he called for reform of the House of Lords so that it included representatives of the Colonies, Dominions and states of the Commonwealth. Aitken was a rare speaker, choosing to intervene only in those debates where he had a particular knowledge. He remained a backbencher although he was a member of the round- table conference on the constitution of Malta in 1955. His support for the Commonwealth made him distrust attempts to have the United Kingdom sign the Treaty of Rome. His most famous action in Parliament was to introduce his Private Member's Bill of 1961, the Highways (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which gave local authorities more powers to remove obstructions to roads and to acquire land to build straight roads. In 1960 Aitken voted to support a Labour amendment to the Betting Levy Board to reduce the Jockey Club's members of the Horserace Betting Levy Board to one, on the grounds that there should also be a veterinary surgeon on the board. In 1962, Aitken was given the honour of moving the 'loyal address' after the Queen's Speech. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 1963. Death He died suddenly in January 1964 aged 60. He is buried in the churchyard of St. Mary's, Playford, Suffolk.

Currently he is the Chairman and CEO of Rise Global. He formerly led Riverdeep for a decade, later known as EMPG and HMH. He grew the small educational software company into the largest K-12 publishing company in the American education system through a series of acquisitions that were funded by loans. As a result of cuts in school textbook purchases, excessive debt, and the end of the dot- com bubble, the company was taken over by bondholders in 2011. This almost wiped out the interests of shareholders and O'Callaghan's own fortune. After the fallout, he became CEO and partial owner of the international division, EMPGi. Early life and education Barry O'Callaghan was born in 1969 in Mitchelstown, County Cork, Ireland. His father was a doctor. O'Callaghan was educated at Clongowes Wood College, a Jesuit secondary boarding school. He was captain of the school's senior cup rugby team and later he played rugby for Trinity College Dublin, where he studied law in the late 1980s. According to O'Callaghan, after graduating he no longer wanted to pursue a career in law. Career=Early work After getting a degree in law, Barry O'Callaghan got a job at investment bank Morgan Stanley, where he \\"quickly prospered\\" working in mergers & acquisitions. He worked in the London office, then later in the Hong Kong office, before moving to New York City to work at Salomon Smith Barney near the beginning of the dot-com bubble. In 1997 O'Callaghan got a senior job the telecommunications and technology division of investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston. There he helped internet companies prepare to go public. O'Callaghan quit Credit Suisse First Boston in 1999 to become the Chief Executive Officer of the digital publishing startup, Riverdeep, in order to take the company public. Riverdeep and EMPGGrowth= Just as CD-ROMs were gaining popularity, O'Callaghan transitioned Riverdeep away from CDs into offering online subscriptions to educational content. He led the acquisition of a software company called Logal, which sold math curriculum online. More significantly, it had intellectual property for a method of converting CD-ROM applications into online downloads. This acquisition was the beginning of O'Callaghan's efforts to web-enable the company's software. It was followed by a $24 million acquisition of ED-Vantage and an $85 million acquisition of Edmark. Both were IBM subsidiaries that provided digital educational content online and together the acquisitions made IBM a 14 percent shareholder in Riverdeep. As O'Callaghan expanded Riverdeep's network of distribution partners that sold the software to individual schools, IBM became a significant partner in referring business to Riverdeep. O'Callaghan took Riverdeep through an initial public offering on Nasdaq in 2000, during the height of the dot-com bubble. Initially it received a $2 billion valuation after having tripled in share price over a few days of trading. O'Callaghan's seven percent interest in the company became worth $126 million. The company's revenue and profits was steadily improving, but as the tech-bubble waned, the stock price dropped to one-third of its initial share price. The Sunday Business Post said Riverdeep's time as a public company was difficult, in particular due to criticisms from activist investor David Rocker, who accused Riverdeep of shady accounting practices. In response to Rocker's criticisms and improving financials, but a declining share price as the tech bubble declined, O'Callaghan and others took the company private, through a management buyout in 2003. The buyout was controversial. Investors accused O'Callaghan of opportunistically buying the company at a low share-price and O'Callaghan responded by offering to withdraw his buyout if anyone was willing to pay ten percent more. The buyout brought O'Callaghan's interest in the company to 21 percent. From 2003 to 2004, he \\"streamlined\\" the company, negotiated 300 million euro in bonds and worked to expand into international markets, like the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia. O'Callaghan and company founder Pat McDonagh bought the shares of venture capitalists; then O'Callaghan bought McDonagh's portion in 2006, giving O'Callaghan a 59.4 percent share of the company. Ernst & Young \\"abruptly\\" left as the company's accounting auditors that year, saying the company made \\"incorrect representations\\" about \\"a material contract,\\" an allegation O'Callaghan denied. O'Callaghan used low-interest loans to fund acquisitions of traditional print publishers. At first he led the acquisition of smaller publishers, before buying Houghton Mifflin and Reed Elsevier's US school business, which were bought for $1.75 billion and $4 billion in 2006 and 2007 respectively. He merged Riverdeep with Houghton Mifflin in 2006 to create the Education Media and Publishing Group (EMPG), before acquiring Harcourt Education in America from Reed Elsevier. O'Callaghan owned about one-third of the company and is estimated to have had 1.5 billion euro in assets after both acquisitions. He was the largest investor in the company. The acquisitions made EMPG the largest educational publisher in the US market, but it became laden with debt from loans made to fund the acquisitions. =Decline= According to O'Callaghan, the company was doing well until August 2008. That year the great recession caused US states, and California in particular, to cut spending on textbooks from EMPG. As education budgets were cut, the company was forced to re-negotiate with bondholders. It owed $700 million per year in interest payments for the loan-funded acquisitions. The Houghton Miffin brand also fell out of favor with many in the literary community after discontinuing some of its contracts with writers. O'Callaghan became Chief Executive Officer of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in April 2009, after the prior CEO retired. O'Callaghan refinanced the company in 2009, reducing its debt by $1 billion. He tried to sell the Houghton Mifflin business, but turned down the offers he got as being too low. In 2010, bondholders that Riverdeep was indebted to converted their debts into equity in the company, and took control of the business in order to avoid bankruptcy. This almost completely eliminated the interests of shareholders, including O'Callaghan, whose shares were used as collateral for most of the loans. He went from being seventh place in the Sunday Times list of richest people, to the 21st. He had $1.2 billion in assets in 2008 and 348 million by the end of 2009, as his 22% stake in the company was almost completely eliminated. O'Callaghan continued to serve as CEO until resigning from that position in 2011 and serving as an advisor for an additional year. During this time, the company was restructured, reducing its debt by another $4 billion. According to The Independent, O'Callaghan became rich by turning a small, high-risk software business into a major corporation, but then lost his fortune investing in old- fashioned print businesses during the downturn. O'Callaghan said the company's financial problems were the result of unpredictable market circumstances for textbook purchases and paying too much for the Houghton Mifflin business. He blamed \\"bad timing, and, frankly, bad luck.\\" According to The Independent, \\"he expanded too quickly and took on too much debt just as the credit crisis began.\\" The Irish Times said O'Callaghan responded to the crisis quickly thanks to \\"deft management\\" and the \\"loyalty of his business partners.\\" The Globe said he was a \\"freewheeling Irishman\\" that was skating on \\"thin ice.\\" Business author Paul Carro said O'Callaghan had built \\"a house of cards\\" where failure was inevitable. Recent work After the EMPG fallout, O'Callaghan continued to serve as chairman for EMPGi, an international division of EMPG focused on Asia. According to O'Callaghan, he was brokering deals with US states, Panama, Qatar and the Arab Emirates for digital education products. He also facilitated several acquisitions for EMPGi, particularly in China. In 2013, Rise Global purchased the Chinese business of Houghton Mifflin and O'Callaghan became CEO of Rise Global, which teaches English to people in Asia, the Middle East and elsewhere. He personally owns exclusive rights to some of HMH's educational materials for teaching the English language. Barry sold the Chinese business for 14 times its annual profit. He said it was sold due to Chinese laws restricting foreigners from owning educational assets in China.

She focuses her research efforts on combating diseases that primarily afflict people in developing nations. Education Harris received a BA in biochemical sciences from Harvard University in 1987 and a PhD in molecular and cell biology from the University of California, Berkeley in 1993. Career After a post-doctoral fellowship and Assistant Adjunct Professorship at the University of California, San Francisco, Harris joined the faculty at UC Berkeley. There, she developed a multidisciplinary approach for studying the virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of dengue fever, the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease in humans. Harris' lab studies the mechanism of dengue virus infection of human dendritic cells. The lab is also developing a mouse model to study viral tropism and the immune response to dengue virus infection, to generate a better model of the disease. Harris' fieldwork focuses on molecular and epidemiological field studies of dengue in endemic Latin American countries, particularly in Nicaragua. Ongoing fieldwork projects include clinical and biological studies of severe dengue, a pediatric cohort study of dengue transmission in Managua, and a project on evidence-based, community-derived interventions for prevention of dengue via control of its mosquito vector. Harris is currently initiating studies of dengue pathogenesis in humans, focusing on functional characterization of antibodies and B cell memory response, host gene expression profiling, and viral factors such as quasispecies. Harris is also collaborating with investigators at the UC Berkeley College of Engineering to develop the ImmunoSensor: a novel, rapid, low-cost diagnostic device for point-of-care diagnosis of dengue and other infectious diseases. She served as co-director of the \\"International Training and Research in Emerging Infectious Diseases\\" program at the Fogarty International Center from 1997 to 2003. She has published over 150 peer- reviewed articles. Dengue virus research In 2010, Harris entered into a research agreement with NanoViricides, Inc. (NNVC). Humanitarian work While volunteering overseas, Harris noted the lack of resources available to her local peers. Knowing that the technologies and resources needed existed in the developed world, but were unavailable where they were most needed, inspired her to introduce molecular diagnostic techniques and scientific literacy in resource-poor settings. In 1997, Harris received a MacArthur Fellowship for her pioneering work over the previous ten years developing programs, and for working to build scientific capacity in developing countries to address public health and infectious disease issues. To continue and expand this work, Harris founded the Sustainable Sciences Institute in 1998, a San Francisco-based international nonprofit organization that works to improve public health in developing countries, by building local capacity for scientific research on infectious diseases. The Sustainable Sciences Institute partners with researchers in developing countries, offering assistance and mentoring to help them excel in their fields of research. Harris is also a current board member of Hesperian Health Guides, a non-profit health publisher known for its flagship publication, Where There Is No Doctor.

The Sisters were installed in the old Convent of the Augustinian Recollects that Bishop Rooker had offered. The parish priest transferred his residence elsewhere. January 9, 1905, the new school opened with 30 girls (15 of whom were aged 15 to 20), four of them were boarders, and six boys. Children, women, and young men came to the school for religious instruction. Besides the regular academic courses, there were supplementary classes in music, drawing, painting, French, sewing, and embroidery. The medium of instruction was English. However, since the Americans had been in the Philippines only for five years, very few pupils were acquainted with the language. Hence, the Sisters were obliged to learn Visayan and Spanish to be able to communicate with their charges.

Method  Trapping is performed with gene trap vectors whose principal element is a gene trapping cassette consisting of a promoterless reporter gene and/or selectable genetic marker, flanked by an upstream 3' splice site (splice acceptor; SA) and a downstream transcriptional termination sequence (polyadenylation sequence; polyA). When inserted into an intron of an expressed gene, the gene trap cassette is transcribed from the endogenous promoter of that gene in the form of a fusion transcript in which the exon(s) upstream of the insertion site is spliced in frame to the reporter/selectable marker gene. Since transcription is terminated prematurely at the inserted polyadenylation site, the processed fusion transcript encodes a truncated and nonfunctional version of the cellular protein and the reporter/selectable marker. Thus, gene traps simultaneously inactivate and report the expression of the trapped gene at the insertion site, and provide a DNA tag (gene trap sequence tag, GTST) for the rapid identification of the disrupted gene.  Access  The International Gene Trap Consortium is centralizing the data and supplies modified cell lines.

Each province has its own economic advantages and geologic hazards and plays an important role in shaping everyday life in the state. They are: (listed from the southeast corner to the northwest corner) the Atlantic Coastal Plain Province, the Piedmont Province, the New England Province, the Ridge and Valley Province, the Appalachian Plateau Province, and the Central Lowlands Province.Sevon, W.D. (2000). Physiographic Provinces of Pennsylvania, Map 13. Pennsylvania Geologic Survey. Harrisburg, PA. A majority of the rocks in Pennsylvania exposed at the surface are sedimentary and were deposited during the Paleozoic Era. Almost all of the metamorphic and igneous rocks are confined to the southeast portion of the state. A total of four orogenies have affected the rocks of the Commonwealth including the Grenville orogeny, the Taconic orogeny, the Acadian orogeny, and the Appalachian orogeny. The Appalachian event has left the most evidence and has continued to shape the landscape of the state. The Pennsylvania terrain has also been affected by continental rifting during the Mesozoic era.Schultz, C.H. ed. (2002) The Geology of Pennsylvania. Special Publication No.1. Pennsylvania Geologic Survey and Pittsburgh Geological Society. Pleistocene glaciers have also repeatedly visited the state over the last 100,000 years. These glaciers have left some evidence and carved out much of the landscape of the northern tier of the state. Anthracite coal, a high value rock from eastern Pennsylvania. A rock with high economic value from Pennsylvania is Anthracite coal. Before mining began, there was an estimated 22.8 billion tons of anthracite in Pennsylvania. In 2001, 12 billion tons still remained in the ground, most of which was not economically feasible to mine.Edmunds, W.E., (2002), Coal in Pennsylvania (2nd ed.): Pennsylvania Geological Survey, Educational Series 7, p. 17. American geologists recognized the importance of Pennsylvania's coal region and named the Upper Carboniferous Period the Pennsylvanian Period because of the abundance of coal in the state. Despite this, Celestine was proposed as the state mineral in 2002. The proposal however, was not approved by the state legislature.Pennsylvania Geological Survey: Rocks and MineralsEdwin, C., (2003). Celestine, the Proposed State Mineral. Pennsylvania Geology, Pennsylvania Geological Survey, Harrisburg, PA. V 33 n 1. Pennsylvania is also home to the famous Drake Oil Well in Titusville which helped give rise to the modern oil industry and two brand name motor oils, Quaker State (now owned by Royal Dutch Shell) and Pennzoil. Pennsylvania also has reserves of natural gas from both deeply buried source rocks and coal-bed areas.  Atlantic Coastal Plain  One of the smallest physiographic provinces in the state is confined to Philadelphia, Delaware, and Bucks counties along the Delaware River. Local relief is less than and much of the bedrock is buried under recent alluvial deposits. On the geologic map, \\"Trenton Gravel\\" is used to describe most of these sediments. However, much of the alluvial sediments that exist here are sand, silt, and clays.D. W. Greenman, D. R. Rima, W. N. Lockwood, and Harold Meisler, Ground-water resources of the Coastal Plain area of southeastern Pennsylvania (1961). 375 p., 22 pls. The traditional boundary of the coastal plain is the Fall Line. The coastal plain in Pennsylvania was once home to thousands of acres of fresh water tidal marsh. This was important in the early development of Philadelphia and Chester.Welcome to John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum Many of the small tributaries to the Delaware have cut small but impressive gorges into the bedrock, including the Ridley Creek, the Chester Creek, and the Wissahickon Creek. Flash floods are becoming a local problem in the province. Piedmont The Piedmont in Pennsylvania is divided into three distinct sections: the Piedmont Uplands, the Piedmont Lowlands, and the Gettysburg- Newark Lowlands. Much of the Piedmont is becoming urbanized and developed. Some of the best farmland in the state is in this region, specifically Lancaster and Chester counties. Piedmont Uplands The top plate illustrates the tectonic setting for the deposition of much of the sediments that make up this section This section is characterized by the metamorphic rocks that provide much of the bedrock for this area. The oldest exposed rocks in Pennsylvania are found here and consist of the Baltimore Gneiss.Blackmer, G.C., (2005). Preliminary Bedrock Geologic Map of a Portion of the Wilmington 30- by 60-Minute Quadrangle, Southeastern Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Open-File Report OFBM-05-01.0. These rocks have a complex history and a vast array of different minerals. They are similar in many respects to their cousins in northern and central Maryland, immediately to the south. Much of the rock was altered during the formation of Rodinia during the Grenville orogeny. These rocks eventually provided the platform for the deposition of sediment that would become the Wissahickon Formation during a rifting of Rodinia. Sea floor spreading continued until a passive margin developed along the new Iapetus Ocean and a beach strandline developed. These sediments eventually became the Chickies Formation. Siliclasitc and carbonate deposition continued through the Cambrian and into the Ordovician period. During the Taconic orogeny, more igneous intrusions and metamorphism occurred as the ancestral Taconic Mountains were pushed up. The sediments that were deposited in a sea between an island-arc and the Iapetus eventually were squeezed and deformed along a subduction zone. The sediments deposited in that sea are now located in the Great Valley section. (See below) The sediments placed from the rifting of Rodinia became the roots of the ancestral Taconics and went through their first wave of metamorphism during the Taconic orogeny. Additional waves of metamorphism continued up until the Alleghanian orogeny. Piedmont Lowlands The lowlands are underlain primarily by more easily eroded rocks such as limestone, dolomite, and phyllite. These rocks are relatively younger in age than the surrounding uplands and are likely the result of a quiet stretch of shallow sea deposition. Some of the rocks deposited during this time are also found in the Great Valley section but have been separated by the Gettysburg-Newark Lowland section. Relief is low and generally never rises above . Karst terrain is problematic in this section. Gettysburg-Newark Lowlands This section is a bit misleading since there are hills as high as in this section. It is separated from the rest of the Piedmont sections due to the distinctive rock types found here. Also called the Triassic Basin, most of the bedrock are red sandstone, siltstone, and shale. A few formations are brown and black. The sediment accumulated during the rifting of Pangea in the Triassic age. Also, a basaltic igneous rock called diabase formed dykes and sills later in the Jurassic as the Atlantic Ocean began to form.Faill, R.T. (2004). The Birdsboro Basin. Pennsylvania Geology, Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Harrisburg, PA. V 34 n 4. Much of the rocks from this area have been eroded away, but the more erosion resistant diabase has left hills and small elevated regions throughout the section. The erosion patterns of these rocks played a pivotal role in the Battle of Gettysburg.Smith, R.C. and Keen, R.C., (2004). Regional Rifts and the Battle of Gettysburg. Pennsylvania Geology, Pennsylvania Geological Survey, Harrisburg, PA. V 34 n 3. =Buckingham Valley= A small slice of Paleozoic rocks, mostly carbonates, exists in Buckingham Township. These rocks lie north of the Furlong fault which is an offshoot of the larger Chalfont fault.Glaeser, J. D. (1966). \\"Provenance, Dispersdal, and Depositional Environments of Triassic Sediments in the Newark- Gettysburg Basin\\". Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, G43, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Buckingham Mountain rises south of the valley and comprises quartzite. The other ridge is less prominent and is underlain by the conglomerates of the Stockton Formation. Karst is a localized problem in this area. New England A small and fragmented province in northeastern Pennsylvania called the Reading Prong is akin to the crystalline bedrock found in much of New England. This is the southern end of the Hudson Highlands of New York and New Jersey (known as the Ramapo Mountains in New Jersey) and the Taconic Mountains of New York. The granitic rocks and quartzite of this area are highly metamorphosed and are Pre-Cambrian to Cambrian in age. Hills and ridges are locally steep and rounded at the top and form the hills around Reading, and to the south of the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton metropolitan area. (See also South Mountain) Ridge and valley A region in Pennsylvania made famous by NASA's LANDSAT images. This province is the second largest in the state and is home to the famous anthracite fields. The rocks here are severely folded and contain numerous anticlines and synclines that plunge and fold back over each other. There are numerous thrust faults that help create a chaotic mess. Most of the deformation is result of continent to continent collision during the Alleghenian orogeny. There are seven distinct regions of the province and they are listed below. Much of the drainage patterns in the province is trellis.  South Mountain  South Mountain is the northern tip of the Blue Ridge Mountains. This region is characterized by broad flat ridges with deep narrow valleys. The rocks here are highly metamorphosed igneous and sedimentary rocks with some occasional dolomite. These rocks are Pre-Cambrian in age. Great Valley The Great Appalachian Valley is a long broad valley that extends from Canada to Alabama. In Pennsylvania, the valley is known by three names: (listed from north to south) the Lehigh Valley, the Lebanon Valley, and the Cumberland Valley. Rocks that characterize this region include: limestone, dolomite, slate, shale, sandstone, siltstone, and some scattered basalt. Almost all of the rocks in the Great Valley in Pennsylvania are Ordovician in age and were deposited during a quiet period before the Taconic orogeny. The limestones and dolomites of this area are extensively quarried in Pennsylvania. These carbonate rocks are used for variety of purposes including, crushed stone, cement manufacturing, fertilizers, and coal-mine dust (reduces acid mine drainage)Barnes, J.H. and Smith, R.C., II, (2001). The non-fuel mineral resources of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Geological Survey, Educational Series 12. Karst features are problematic in the Great Valley. Blue Mountain Lehigh Gap from east peak The Blue Mountain or Blue Ridge region, like the ridgelines to its north and west, is one of a series of near parallel ridges that run for tens of miles, and are equally likely to be called Ridge or Mountain. Hence Blue Mountain is not to be confused with the Blue Ridge Mountains but instead, represents the sharp escarpment, a step in elevation separating the Appalachian Mountains from the pastoral basin famous as the landscape associated with the Pennsylvania Dutch in southern Pennsylvania called the Great Valley (A 'Physiographic Province', as are these section titles). Many of Pennsylvania's water gaps cut through Blue Mountain including Delaware Water Gap, Lehigh Gap, Schuylkill Gap, Susquehanna Gap, and Swatara Gap. Also along the ridge, many \\"wind gaps\\" also exist. (see separate article) The rocks of the Blue Mountain section include mostly Silurian aged sandstone, conglomerate, siltstone, shale, and some limestone. Blue mountain is also known by the names Kittatinny Mountain (especially in New Jersey) and Hawk Mountain. One of the most prominent rock types of this section is the Shawangunk Formation which is named after the Shawangunk Ridge of New York. The sediments that comprise Blue Mountain were deposited as a result of the highlands that formed after the Taconic orogeny. The first wave of sediments were coarse, gray, and poorly sorted. (The Shawngunk Formation) This combination of depositional features means that the source area was relatively close and deposited in a moist climate. These sediments grade into finer reddish sands and silts, (Bloomsburg Formation) as the source area became more distant and/or less productive. The climate during this time was drier. Anthracite Upland Arguably the most complex and most studied section in the state and Pennsylvania's part of the Ridge and Valley province, this area is home to one of Pennsylvania's most profitable coal fields ever, containing high-grade Anthracite coal. The sediments deposited during the Mississippian Period came from highlands located to the southeast. Waves of mountain-building occasionally brought coarser-grained sediments onto the plain. As the mountains eroded, the sediments became more fine-grained. As the highlands became more distant (or more eroded) the sands would grade into silt or clay. Since the North American Plate was near the equator, a tropical climate existed and allowed dense forests to flourish. Beginning in the Late Mississippian, forests of Lycopodiophyta, Arthrophyta, Pteridophyta, and Pteridospermatophyta began to grow in these plains.Oleksyshyn, J. (1982). Fossil Plants From the Anthracite Coal Fields of Eastern Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Harrisburg PA, G72. As the conditions became more favorable for the dense forests to survive for hundred of thousands of years, much of the dead plant material became preserved in oxygen-depleted environments. The accumulation of this material became preserved in the vast coal deposits. The rise and fall of the mountains, along with changes in sea level, occurred numerous times (often in conjunction). These cyclical stratagraphic events sequences are preserved in the rock record and are often called cyclothems. By the Late Permian, much of the continental plate collision had subsided; the mountain building however, still continued. All of the sediments deposited during the previous 30 million years became folded and faulted as the supercontinent Pangea was finally formed. It would take 150 million years for the mountains of this area to achieve the shapes seen today. These mountains are steep-sided and valleys are canoe-shaped, largely due to the area's complex folded structure. Most of the coal being mined from this section is from the Pennsylvanian-aged formations. Along with the Mazon Creek fossil field in Illinois, a tremendous amount of plant fossils has been studied from this area. Landslides and acid mine drainage are two principal hazards of the area. In the past, underground mine fires have also been a threat. The Centralia Mine Fire is located within this section of the Ridge and Valley province. Anthracite Valley View of the Wyoming Valley and the Susquehanna River (in Luzerne County) Detached from the rest of Pennsylvania's anthracite fields, this canoe-shaped valley is also known as the Wyoming Valley and is home to the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. The largest city in the Wyoming Valley is Scranton, with a population of 77,291. The whole structure of the section is a double plunging syncline with sharp mountain ridges on either side of the valley. The ridges meet just north of Carbondale. The North Branch of the Susquehanna River and the Lackawanna River flow through this valley. Large-scale coal mining and its accompanying industry and railroads have long been abandoned. Unlike the southern and middle anthracite fields, the anthracite valley has been recently glaciated repeatedly. This action has left many talus slopes at the base of Moosic Mountains, and the soils often contain large boulders that make excavation difficult. Susquehanna Lowland This region has also seen its landscape altered by glaciation and the fluvial processes of the Susquehanna River. Most of the ridges in this region are parallel to the streams that drain the area. The Susquehanna also cuts through many of the mountain ridges leading some to believe that the Susquehanna is an ancient river system that existed even before the recent continental glaciation. (Some speculate as far back as the Jurassic Period)Inners, J. D., 1998, Rocks and ruins of the ‚ÄúUpper Grand‚Äù‚ÄîAn illustrated trail guide to the geology and historical archeology of Lehigh Gorge State Park: Pennsylvania Geological Survey, 4th ser., Open-File Report 98‚Äì03, 4 p., Portable Document Format (PDF). None of the mountains in this section rise above and the river valley is as low as . Appalachian Mountain View west towards Appalachian Ridge country from Clarks Knob. Standard long, narrow, and steep-sided ridges with narrow valleys define the state in LANDSAT photos. Many of the valleys have karst features due to carbonate rocks that reside in them. Road-building generally follows the valleys and rarely cuts across the ridges. The Pennsylvania Turnpike used tunnels cut through the ridges rather than scaling the mountain tops. Mount Nittany, Tuscarora Mountain, Jacks Mountain, Wills Mountain and Sideling Hill are five prominent mountains in this section. The section contains Cambrian- through Pennsylvanian-aged sediments all deposited into the Appalachian Basin. During the Appalachian orogany, these sediments became folded, faulted, and moved around. Only during the past few million years has the landscape we see today taken shape. The relatively softer or easily weathered rocks became valleys while the harder and erosion-resistant rocks became the mountain ridges. The development of this landscape continues to this day. Uplift of the province has caused rivers to cut water gaps through the mountain ranges, and has continuously presented new softer rocks in the valleys to be eroded away. Appalachian Plateau This is by far the largest province in the state, and most of the rocks in this region are not folded and faulted and sit relatively flat. However, parts of the Appalachian Plateau appear to be mountainous due to erosion caused by streams and glaciers. In western Pennsylvania, large bituminous coal fields exist in rocks with a similar age as the rocks in the anthracite region. Many of the folds in the province are high amplitude and stretch for miles. In glaciated sections, steep canyons developed and much of the terrain have many glacial features. The drainage pattern in this area is dendritic. Glaciated Pocono Plateau The Pocono Mountain section of Pennsylvania is the same (geologically speaking) as the Catskill Mountains of New York. The red-green-gray sedimentary rocks of the Catskill Formation are the predominant bedrock type in the Poconos. The elevation of the plateau is between and with only a few steep hills such as Camelback Mountain (Big Pocono). Much of the rock sits in gently dipping horizontal beds, unlike the neighboring Appalachian Mountain section. Glaciated Low Plateau Considered a part of the Pocono Plateau, this area lies to the north of the Poconos and contains many of the same types of rock. The local relief is less than that of the Pocono region and bounded to the southeast by the Delaware River. The Big Bushkill Creek cuts a gorge through this section and has many waterfalls, especially around the area of Resica Falls Scout Reservation. Dingmans Falls and Bushkill Falls are waterfalls within the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, also a part of the Endless Mountains region of Pennsylvania. Glaciated High Plateau Also an extension of the Catskill Mountains of New York, this section generally has higher elevations than the low plateau section as well as deeper valleys. Younger strata also outcrops in this area with a few minor coal beds. The uplands are rounded or flat along mostly broad hills. An excellent example of the escarpment that divides this section are Ricketts and Ganoga Glen located within Ricketts Glen State Park. Deep Valleys This section is home to the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania and some of the most remote areas of the state. As the name implies, the streams of this area have cut deep valleys with steep sided-slopes on the surrounding ridges. Some of the gorges are at least deep. Much of the area was forested at the end of the 19th century, and much of the area is owned by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry. Allegheny Front Snow covered Blue Knob Mountain (3,146 ft.) looming above the countryside. The Allegheny Front section includes the abrupt escarpment that divides the Ridge and Valley Province from the Allegheny Plateau. The region is a large broad ridge with a steep ascent from east to west and rolling hills away from the ridge. The Allegheny Front reaches its highest elevation in Pennsylvania at Blue Knob, , an unusual bulge along this symmetrical ridgeline. Streams that cut into the ridge are often shallow and steep. Allegheny Mountain This section includes Pennsylvania's highest point, Mount Davis, which stands at above sea level. Many of the mountains are long and broad with relatively shallow and broad valleys. Unlike the Appalachian Mountain section, the streams of this area have not cut deep and well defined valleys into the earth. Much of the drainage pattern is dendritic with a little trellis where erosion resistant rocks have created higher and more well defined ridges. Elevations increase to the south, and Mt. Davis resides only from the Maryland border. A few of the ridge tops contain some low-volatile bituminous coal fields including the Broad Top field. This region is also home to two national stories: the Quecreek Mine Rescue and the crash of United Airlines Flight 93. Waynesburg Hills Located in the southwest corner of the state, the Waynesburg hills are another major coal-producing area for the state. Much of the 64.4 billion tons of bituminous coal that is remaining in the state resides under these hills in near horizontal beds. The hills are narrow and steep-sided, with some deeper valleys. Pittsburgh Low Plateau Another section that is a significant coal producer. It is similar to the Waynesburg hills section except for higher local relief and deeper valleys. Landslides and mine subsidence are common hazards. High Plateau This section consists of high, broad, and flat uplands cut by sharp and shallow river valleys. Much of this area was not covered by the Late Wisconsinan glacier, but there is evidence of pre-Wisconsinan glaciers in the area. Along with the Endless Mountains, it is one of the most remote places in the eastern United States. Northwestern Glaciated Plateau This section has been influenced by glaciers and many of the valleys cut into the bedrock trend northwestward- in the direction of the retreating glaciers. There are many signs of glaciers including kames, eskers, kettles, and moraines. This section is home to Pennsylvania's largest natural lake, Conneaut Lake as well as one of the longest eskers in the state, West Liberty Esker.Van Diver, B. B. (1990). Roadside Geology of Pennsylvania. Mountain Press Publishing Company, Missoula Montana. Some of the drainage patterns have shifted and only a few of the streams flow into Lake Erie. Central Lowlands Along with the Coastal Plain Province, the smallest province in the state, the central lowlands are a part of the Great Lakes area and exist along a glacial escapement adjacent to Lake Erie.

After a stint as a staff writer at The Washington Post, he joined the Times-Picayune as a crime reporter in 1984. Over the years, he has covered national politics, economics, Southern regionalism, pop culture, and New Orleans nightlife, traditions, lifestyles and entertainment. Post-Katrina, Rose gained notoriety and accolades as he chronicled the personal and public struggles of the disaster-stricken area. Rose's column regularly appears at his \\"New Orleans stories\\" Times-Picayune web site. He returned to the theme in various ways, as in satirizing the 2008-2009 e-mail controversies swelling around New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin and Councilwoman Stacy Head.Rose satirically published fictitious e-mail messages to fellow columnist Sheila Stroup about fellow columnist Angus Lind (Chris Rose, \\"The Chris Rose e-mails\\" in Times-Picayune, 2009 May 19, Saint Tammany Edition, p.

He moved to WVUE Fox News 8 a year later, where he delivered his pungent commentary on New Orleans life by video and column, up until his abrupt and arguably controversial termination in March 2013. After his dismissals from Gambit and WVUE, Rose found work as restaurant waiter. More recently, Chris Rose has been writing for Rouses, a grocery store chain based in Louisiana. Rose writes for the chain's trade magazine, contributing articles on food related topics. In 2016, Rose became a licensed tour guide. His walking tour covers mainly the music history of New Orleans and Louisiana. Rose is also the author of 1 Dead in Attic, which is a collection of stories recounting the first four harrowing months of life in New Orleans after Katrina. The book went on to become a New York Times Bestseller and garnered a number of accolades. Awards and nominations Rose was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Distinguished Commentary in 2006 and won a Pulitzer for his contributions to the Times-Picayune's Public Service Award. He was a finalist for the 2006 Michael Kelly Award. Rose reigned as King of the Krewe du Vieux for the 2007 New Orleans Mardi Gras season. Personal life Rose is divorced from Kelly Gluth Rose, a native New Orleanian. They have three children: Katherine, Jack and James. The family adopted a dog left homeless by Hurricane Rita and named the dog Luna Biscuit (which, he jokes, is French for Moon Pie). In the 2007 edition of One Dead In Attic Rose revealed that he and his wife had separated. In October 2006, Rose wrote about taking anti-depressants after suffering from anxiety and depression after Hurricane Katrina.

Subsequently, he was enrolled in the major seminary in Rome. He took Holy Orders and became a priest on 16 March 1957. After his ordination, he remained in Rome until he had completed a comprehensive course of study in church history at the Gregorian University. From 1960 to 1990, he taught church history at the seminary of Bergamo. During his tenure as a teacher there, he was also the headmaster of the theology school from 1969 to 1981.

It is organized into 145 regions, which are grouped into 14 zones. PCA has more than 130,000 members and is the largest single-brand club in the world. The PCA conducts Porsche-related events including driving tours, car shows, club racing, rallying, driver's education, autocrosses, social events, and similar activities.  History  The club was founded in 1955 in Washington, D.C. Bill Sholar, who was a commercial artist in the Washington, D.C. area in the early 1950s bought a new 1953 356 Coupe, and, as time passed, he met other Porsches on the road and flashed his lights at them in silent greeting. By late 1954, Sholar was convinced that a more personal meeting would be appropriate with other Porsche owners to discuss the positive and the not-so-positive aspects of driving the infrequently encountered marque. The first unofficial PCA meeting was held at the Sholar house on February 8, 1955. Following that meeting, several Porsche owners occasionally got together that spring and summer to share knowledge about Porsches. Eventually, they decided to start a club. A brief paragraph in the August 1955 issue of Sports Car Illustrated informed readers that a Porsche club was being formed in the United States; all inquiries were directed to Bill Sholar's attention. As part of the effort, Porsche was petitioned to recognize the proposed club. Today, activities range from competitive events, such as autocrossing, club racing, rallying, and Concours, to social events, such as Touring, vehicle restoration, and Porsche history. A revised ‚ÄúTreffen¬Æ‚Äù now allows PCA members to visit the factory, the new Porsche Museum, the area around Stuttgart, Germany, and the research-and- development unit at Weissach. A professional staff, headed by Executive Director Vu Nguyen, operates the National Office in Columbia, Maryland, where a growing historical section is also housed. One of the objectives stated in PCA's Bylaws is to promote the enjoyment and sharing of goodwill and fellowship engendered by owning a Porsche.  Events  PCA is best known for its events. With over 3,500 annual events and activities, the club has something for every Porsche enthusiast. The club's largest event is the annual Porsche Parade, which is a week-long event where members from around the country gather to participate in various events, such as autocross and Concours d'Elegance. Treffen North America are weekend events held twice a year and focus on driving tours, great locations and fine dining. PCA also hosts two national tech sessions each year called Tech Tactics, with one in California and one in Pennsylvania, as well as two national Concours-style car shows named Werks Reunion, that are held in California and Florida. PCA Regions across North America host thousands of events each year including driving tours, car shows, club racing, rallying, driver's education, autocrosses, social events, and similar activities. Each spring and fall, Porsche Club of America opens a member only raffle, in which members may purchase entries for a chance to win a brand-new Porsche. A number of Porsches have also been made specifically for the club, such as the Porsche 991 GTS Club Coupe, which was to celebrate the club's 60th anniversary.  Regions  PCA is arranged into 145 local Regions in 14 zones across the United States and Canada. Each operates as their own motor club. As of 2018, Upper Canada is the largest region with 2,700 members.

It is divided into six episodes. They are set in the Italian campaign during World War II when Nazi Germany was losing the war against the Allies. A major theme is communication problems due to language barriers. The film was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) and the BAFTA Award for Best Film from any source. It was the most popular Italian film at the box office in 1945‚Äì46, finishing ahead of Mario Mattoli's melodrama Life Begins Anew.Bayman, Louis (ed.) Directory of World Cinema: Italy. Intellect Books, 2011. p.96 Plot=1st Episode During the Allied invasion of Sicily, an American reconnaissance patrol makes its way to a Sicilian village at night. Only one of the Americans speaks Italian. Local Carmela (Carmela Sazio) agrees to guide them past a German minefield. They take shelter in the ruins of a seaside castle. While the others take a look around, Joe (Robert Van Loon) is assigned to keep an eye on Carmela. Despite the language barrier, Joe starts to overcome her indifference. However, he is shot by a German sniper. Before the small German reconnaissance patrol reaches the castle, Carmela hides Joe in the basement. When the Germans send her for water, she sneaks back and checks on Joe, only to find him dead. She takes his rifle and starts shooting at the enemy. The Germans throw her off a cliff to her death and leave. When the Americans return, they find Joe's body and assume Carmela killed him. 2nd Episode The Allies invade mainland Italy and capture the port of Naples. An orphaned street urchin named Pasquale (Alfonsino Pasca) happens upon Joe (Dots Johnson), an embittered, completely drunk African-American soldier. When Joe falls asleep, Pasquale takes his boots. The next day, Joe, a military policeman, nabs Pasquale in the act of stealing supplies from a truck. Joe demands his boots back, but when the boy takes him to where he lives, the sight of the squalor causes Joe to leave without them. 3rd Episode Fred (Gar Moore) is a drunken American soldier in liberated Rome. A young woman, Francesca, takes him to her room, hoping to earn a little money through prostitution. He is not interested and tells her of his futile search for a young woman he met and fell in love with shortly after the liberation of the city, six months before. As he describes the woman, Francesca realizes that she is the woman; both of them have changed so much in the short time that has passed, they did not recognize each other. Francesca says she knows the woman. When Fred falls asleep, Francesca slips out, asking the building superintendent to give Fred a slip of paper with her address on it when he awakes and leaves. Fred assumes the address is that of a whorehouse, throws the piece of paper away and leaves the city with his unit. The next day, Francesca waits in vain for him. 4th Episode The southern half of Florence is freed, but fierce fighting continues in the other half, across the Arno river, between Italian partisans and the Germans and their die-hard fascist allies. All the bridges except the Ponte Vecchio have been blown up, stalling the Allied advance. American nurse Harriet (Harriet Medin) is frantic to get across and be reunited with a painter. She learns that he is now \\"Lupo\\", leader of the local partisans. She and partisan Massimo (Renzo Avanzo), a man desperate for news of his family, risk their lives and cross into the still-occupied city through the supposedly secret Vasari Corridor, which when Rossellini filmed it was still mostly empty of its art collection. While managing to get across on the other side Harriet and Massimo find themselves in the middle of a war torn Florence. In a shooting of German against partisans Harriet carries a wounded solder to a doorway. She is devastated to learn that Lupo has been killed. 5th Episode Three American chaplains are welcomed to stay the night at a newly liberated Roman Catholic monastery. Captain Bill Martin (William Tubbs), who is the only one of the chaplains who speaks Italian, acts as interpreter. The monks are dismayed to learn from Martin that only he is a Catholic; his two colleagues are a Protestant and a Jew. When the guests and their hosts sit down to supper, Martin observes that the monks have nothing on their plates. He inquires and learns that the monks have decided to fast in the hope of gaining the favor of Heaven to convert the other two to their faith. 6th Episode In December 1944, three members of the OSS are operating behind German lines with Italian partisans in the Po delta. They rescue two downed British airmen, but run out of ammunition in a battle with the enemy and are captured. The partisans are summarily executed the next day, as they are not protected by the Geneva Conventions. Two of the outraged prisoners of war are shot when they try to interfere. Production After the enormous international success of Rome, Open City, Rossellini was able to obtain funding from international investors, particularly in the U.S. He decided to make a film about the liberation of Italy from the Allied invasion in 1943 to the end of World War II in 1945. Unusually for a film with much dialogue not in English, Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer took over distribution of the movie in the United States (from smaller firm Burstyn & Mayer), helping its visibility.Leslie Halliwell and John Walker, Halliwell's Film & Video Guide, 1999. New York: HarperCollins, 1998 Rossellini engaged six writers, each of whom was to write one episode: Klaus Mann, Marcello Pagliero, Sergio Amidei, Federico Fellini, Alfred Hayes, and Vasco Pratolini. Each episode took place in a different location. The script notwithstanding, Rossellini often improvised with the actors and rewrote the stories as they were being filmed. For the first episode filmed in Sicily, Rossellini discarded the script and coached the non-professional, illiterate lead actress Carmela Sazio to a performance that received critical praise.Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 2. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. p. 962. Critical reception Bosley Crowther of The New York Times hailed it, writing it \\"marks a milestone in the expressiveness of the screen.\\" He went on to say \\"It is useless to attempt an explanation, in familiar and concrete terms, of its basic theme and nature, for it is not an ordinary film‚Äîneither in form nor dramatic construction nor in the things it has to say\\", \\"the antithesis of the classic 'story film'\\". He ended his review with \\"This is a film to be seen‚Äîand seen again.\\" J√≥se Luis Guarner praised the first episode, stating that the camera \\"keeps still throughout the long conversation, content to look and record, like a film by Louis Lumiere. A lot more is suggested than can actually be seen: the soldier's loneliness, his need to talk to someone, his longing for home and family, the girl's growing confidence...to show all this with such economy of means is one of the greatest secrets of the cinema. The whole of Pais√† witnesses the same pressing need to portray a complex reality directly, at one go.\\" Guarner went on to call it \\"Rossellini's first masterpiece, a masterpiece of neorealism as well as one of the peaks of film history.\\" Andre Bazin wrote that \\"the unit of cinematic narrative in Pais√† is not the \\"shot\\", an abstract of a reality which is being analyzed, but the \\"fact\\": A fragment of concrete reality in itself multiple and full of ambiguity, whose meaning emerges only [afterwards] ... thanks to other imposed facts between which the mind establishes certain relationships.\\" Robin Wood praised the film's newsreel footage-like style in adding to the realism and compared the scene of peasants being rounded up in the Po Valley to the Odessa Steps sequence in Battleship Potemkin. TV Guide called it \\"perhaps Rossellini's greatest achievement\\", \\"a wartime portrait full of humor, pathos, romance, tension, and warmth\\", and \\"a film unlike any other the world had seen\\". \\"PAISAN highlights the power of the neorealist style better than almost any other film.\\" The Chicago Reader's Dave Kehr observed that \\"The episodes all seem to have an anecdotal triteness ... but each acquires a wholly unexpected naturalness and depth of feeling from Rossellini's refusal to hype the anecdotes with conventional dramatic rhetoric.\\" Richard Brody of The New Yorker noted that \\"the sketch-like format of the six-part Paisan, from 1946, enabled him to mix actors and nonactors, to film in sequence and improvise his stories as he went along, and to use newsreel-style camerawork.\\" All eight Rotten Tomatoes reviews are favorable toward the film. Director Martin Scorsese has also listed it as one of his favourite films and his favorite of the Rossellini films. Influence Roberto Rossellini's film would inspire future directors, such as Italian Gillo Pontecorvo, to become filmmakers themselves. Later, Pontecorvo would create films, like Battle of Algiers (1966), in which he adopted Rosselini's techniques of using non-professional actors and real locations.

Global marketing is also a field of study in general business management that aims to market products, solutions and services to customers locally, nationally, and internationally. International marketing is the extension of an organization's product or services into another country. This can be achieved by exporting a company's product into another location, entry through a joint venture with another firm in the target country, or foreign direct investment into the target country. The development of the marketing mix for that country is then required - international marketing. This can include the use of existing marketing strategies, mix and tools for export on the one side, or a relationship strategy including localization, local product offerings, pricing, production and distribution with customized promotions, offers, website, social media and leadership, etc.. Internationalization and international marketing meets the needs of selected foreign countries where a company's value can be exported and there is inter-firm and firm learning, optimization, and efficiency in economies of scale and scope. Evolution to global marketing The international marketplace has been transformed by shifts in trading techniques, standards and practices. These changes have been reinforced and retained by new technologies and evolving economic relationships between the companies and organizations involved in international trade. The traditional ethnocentric conceptual view of international marketing trade is being counterbalanced by a more global view of markets. Domestic marketing Domestic marketing is the limited commercialization of goods and services to a single, home country. The advantages of domestic marketing include familiarity with the extent of political risk, the quality of skilled human resources and of natural resources, and the ramifications of existing and likely legislation in relevant areas such as safety, hygiene, employment, and ownership of capital. These markets are restrained by the laws and regulations of the country. Domestic marketing is typically organized in the headquarters. Global marketing Global marketing requires a firm to understand the requirements associated with servicing customers locally with global standard solutions or products and localizes that product as required to maintain an optimal balance of cost, efficiency, customization and localization in a control-customization continuum to meet local, national and global requirements. Global marketing and global branding are integrated. Branding involves a structured process of analyzing \\"soft\\" assets and \\"hard\\" assets of a firm's resources. The strategic analysis and development of a brand includes customer analysis (trends, motivation, unmet needs, segmentation), competitive analysis (brand image/brand identity, strengths, strategies, vulnerabilities), and self-analysis (existing brand image, brand heritage, strengths/capabilities, organizational values).Building Strong Brands, David Aaker, E.T. Grether Professor of Marketing Strategy at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley Global brand identity development is the process of establishing brands of products, the firm, and services locally and worldwide with consideration for scope, product attributes, quality, uses, users and country of origin; organizational attributes; personality attributes, and brand-customer relationship; and important symbols, trademarks metaphors, imagery, mood, photography and the company's brand heritage. A global marketing and branding implementation system distributes marketing assets, affiliate programs and materials, internal communications, newsletters, investor materials, event promotions and trade shows to deliver integrated, comprehensive and focused communication, access and value to the customers. Elements of global marketing =Product The product must deliver a minimum level of performance. A global company must be able to tweak elements of a product for different markets. For example, Coca-Cola uses two formulas (one with sugar, one with corn syrup) for all markets. The product packaging in every country incorporates the contour bottle design and the dynamic ribbon in some way, shape, or form. The bottle can also include the country's native language and is the same size as other beverage bottles or cans in that same country. Price The price of a product varies based on factors such as costs of production, target segment, and supply-demand dynamics. There can be several types of pricing strategies, each tied in with an overall business plan. Pricing can also be used as a demarcation, to differentiate and enhance the image of a product. The price will always vary from market to market. Place Refers to the point of sale. How the product is distributed is influenced by how the competition is being offered to the target market. With Coca-Cola, not all cultures use vending machines. In the United States, beverages are sold by the pallet via warehouse stores. In India, this is not an option. Placement decisions are also affected by the product's position in the market place. For example, a high-end product would not be distributed via a dollar store in the United States. Conversely, a product promoted as the low-cost option in France would find limited success in a pricey boutique. Promotion Activities undertaken to make the product or service known to the user and trade including advertising, word of mouth, press reports, incentives, commissions and awards to the trade.

Advantages and disadvantages=Advantages The advantages of global marketing include: * Economies of scale in production and distribution * Lower marketing costs * Power and scope * Consistency in brand image * Ability to leverage ideas quickly and efficiently * Uniformity of marketing practices * Helps to establish relationships outside of the 'political arena' * Helps to encourage ancillary industries to be set up to cater to the needs of the global player * Benefits of eMarketing over traditional marketing =Reach= The internet provides a low-cost means for businesses to expand their reach globally. Global reach was traditionally limited to multinationals with large budgets, but eMarketing opens up new avenues for smaller businesses to access potential consumers from all over the world. =Scope= Internet marketing provides flexibility to marketers in terms of product offerings and channels to reach consumers. eMarketing includes information management, public relations, customer service and sales. =Interactivity= eMarketing facilitates conversations between companies and consumers. With a two-way communication channel, companies can adapt to the responses of their consumers. =Immediacy= Internet marketing is able to provide an immediate impact. eMarketing enables businesses to effectively operate 24/7. =Demographics and targeting= Internet users can be considered a demographic group skewed towards the middle-classes. Marketers can also access niche markets through eMarketing more easily. =Cross cultural negotiation= The dimensions of culture is an area of marketing and social science that is closely related to Global marketing. The ability to discern cultural differences through an initial assessment of another market is considered a critical enabler to progress in Global marketing. Cultural value differences are a factor in the effectiveness of an advertising campaign as advertising campaigns will be perceived differently in different countries. =Adaptivity and closed loop marketing= Closed-loop marketing requires constant measurement and analysis of the results of marketing initiatives. With eMarketing, responses can be analyzed in real-time and campaigns can be tweaked continuously. Disadvantages * Differences in consumer needs, wants, and usage patterns for products * Differences in consumer response to marketing mix elements * Differences in brand and product development and the competitive environment * Differences in the legal environment, some of which may conflict with those of the home market * Differences in the institutions available, some of which may call for the creation of entirely new ones (e.g. infrastructure) * Differences in administrative procedures * Differences in product placement * Differences in the administrative procedures and product placement can occur See also * Advertising * Advertising research * Globalization * International marketing * Marketing * Marketing research * Nation branding * wikt:Picture Sorts * Visual marketing ReferencesFurther reading * Hollensen, Svend (2017) Global Marketing, 7th edition, Pearson, . * Svante Andersson & G√∂ran Svensson (editors) (2009) Global Marketing: think globally and act locally, Lund: Studentlitteratur, . * Kotabe, Masaki and Helsen, Kristiaan (2004) Global Marketing Management, 3rd edition, John Wiley & Sons, . * Philip Kotler & Keller (2005) Marketing Management, 12th edition, . * Theodore Levitt (May‚ÄìJune 1983) \\"The Globalization of Markets\\", Harvard Business Review 61: 92-10. * Young, Charles E.

MOMIX is a dance company that he formed in 1981 as an offshoot of the Pilobolus, which he had co-founded while a senior at Dartmouth College in 1971. He remained a full-time member with the company until 1980. He choreographs dance sculptures that bring together acrobatics, gymnastics, mime, props, and film. Early years Born and raised on a dairy farm in Lyndonville, Vermont. Pendleton exhibited Holstein Friesians at the Caledonia County Fair. He attended Dartmouth College, graduating in 1971 with a BA in English Literature. In that same year he co-founded Pilobolus, which won acclaim for its blend of acrobatics, body sculpture, and humor. Pierre Cardin presented the group on Broadway in 1977. Pendleton left the company to start MOMIX four years later. MOMIX Pendleton performed a solo dance called \\"MOMIX\\" with Pilobolus at the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid. The following year MOMIX became the name of the company he founded with Alison Becker Chase. Over the past 40 years MOMIX has become one of the most popular and widely seen dance companies in the world. It has had as many as three teams of dancers performing simultaneously on three continents. Its repertoire includes full-evening works such as Passion, with a score by Peter Gabriel; In Orbit; Baseball; Opus Cactus; Lunar Sea; MOMIX: Remix; Botanica; Alchemy and the company's latest creation, Alice. Inspiration and Ideology Pendleton takes much of his inspiration for his work from the natural world, plants, animals and minerals. On stage, portrays resemble sunflowers and marigolds.

It was first published in 1861. The play is considered to be one of the major works of Hungarian literature and is one of the most often staged Hungarian plays today. Many lines have become common quotations in Hungary. The 1984 film The Annunciation (Angyali √ºdv√∂zlet) was based on the play, as was the 2011 animated film The Tragedy of Man. Synopsis The Expulsion; illustration by Mih√°ly Zichy The main characters are Adam, Eve and Lucifer. As God creates the universe, Lucifer decries it as futile, stating that man will soon aspire to be gods and demanding their own right of the world, because God was forced to create with then, \\"the ancient spirit of denial\\". God casts him out of Heaven, but grants his wish: the two cursed trees in Eden, the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Immortality. Playing on Eve's vanity and Adam's pride, Lucifer tempts both into sin. After the Fall and expulsion from Eden, Adam is still too proud to admit that he acted wrongly. Instead, he recounts his dreams of human progress and achievement; he feels that now, unencumbered by God's rules, he is ready to pursue his own glory. Lucifer puts Adam to sleep, and the two begin to travel through history. The first period they visit, ancient Egypt, is the realization of Adam's dream of immense human achievements. However, his joy is abruptly cut off when he finds that the pyramids are being built on the backs of slaves (as a later-executed slave points out, \\"millions for one\\"). Adam, in the role of a pharaoh, falls in love with Eve, a slave- girl; with renewed hope, he now tells Lucifer to take him to a world where all men live in equality, and Lucifer transports him to democratic Greece. In each period, Adam's previous dreams are exposed as futile, flawed, or unattainable, and Eve appears just in time to refresh Adam's spirit, and the cycle repeats. Adam and Lucifer are introduced at the beginning of each scene, with Adam assuming various important historical roles and Lucifer usually acting as a servant or confidant. Eve enters only later in each scene, usually as a historical character. Adam is usually engrossed in his role at the beginning of each scene, and only becomes self-aware and aware of Lucifer as his guide near the end. Eve never breaks out of character. From the 19th century period on, Adam is no longer a leader, but retreats into an observer role, his political and historical enthusiasm having disappeared. Likewise, throughout the dream, Adam is older and older with each passing scene, representing not only his increasing wisdom but also the increasing burden of hopelessness. The final dream scene is in an ice age in the far future. The Sun is dying, civilization has disappeared, and mankind has been reduced to a few scattered savages trying to eke out a living. It is never addressed whether this is truly the future Mad√°ch foresaw, or whether this is an elaborate illusion on the part of Lucifer to make Adam lose hope once and for all. Awaking from his dream, Adam declares that the future is hopeless, and that the only course of action now open to him is to kill himself, thereby ending the human race before it begins and preventing all the meaningless suffering the future holds. As he is poised to throw himself from a cliff, Eve finds him, and happily announces that she is pregnant. Adam falls to his knees and declares that God has vanquished him. God rebukes Satan, and tells Adam that regardless of whether he sees hope or not, his task is only to \\"strive on, and have faith.\\" Sequence of scenes The Tragedy of Man contains fifteen scenes, with ten historical periods represented. The scenes, their locations, and the identity of the main protagonists in each are as follows. SCENE 1 ‚Äì In Heaven, immediately following the creation. SCENE 2 ‚Äì In the Garden of Eden at the Beginning of Human History, likely around 50,000 BC. SCENE 3 ‚Äì Outside the Garden of Eden at the Beginning of Human History. SCENE 4 ‚Äì Egypt, c. 2650 BC. Adam is a Pharaoh, most likely Djoser; Lucifer his Vizier Imhotep; Eve is the widow of a slave. SCENE 5 ‚Äì Athens, 490-489 BC. Adam is Miltiades the Younger; Lucifer is a city guard; Eve is Miltiades' wife. SCENE 6 ‚Äì Rome, c. 67 AD. Adam is a wealthy Roman; Lucifer is his friend, Eve is a prostitute. SCENE 7 ‚Äì Constantinople, 1096 AD. Adam is Tancred, Prince of Galilee; Lucifer is his squire; Eve is a noble maiden forced to become a nun. SCENE 8 ‚Äì Prague, c. 1612-15. Adam is Johannes Kepler; Lucifer is his pupil; Eve is his wife, Barbara. SCENE 9 ‚Äì Paris, 1793-94 (in a dream of Kepler). Adam is Georges Danton; Lucifer is an executioner; Eve appears in two forms, first as an aristocrat about to be executed, then immediately following as a bloodthirsty poor woman. SCENE 10 ‚Äì Prague, c. 1615. Adam is Johannes Kepler; Lucifer is his pupil; Eve is his wife, Barbara. SCENE 11 ‚Äì London, 19th century. Adam and Lucifer are nameless Englishmen; Eve is a young woman of the middle class. SCENE 12 ‚Äì A Communist/Technocratic Phalanstery, in the future. Adam and Lucifer masquerade as traveling chemists; Eve is a worker who protests when she is separated from her child. SCENE 13 ‚Äì Space. Adam and Lucifer are themselves, Eve does not appear in this scene. SCENE 14 ‚Äì An ice age in the distant future, at least 6000 AD. Adam is a broken old man; Lucifer is himself; Eve is an Eskimo's wife. SCENE 15 ‚Äì Outside Eden at the Beginning of Human History. Interpretation The play is invariably compared to John Milton's Paradise Lost, as the two deal with the same subject matter‚Äîthe creation and fall of Man, and the devil's role in it. As in Paradise Lost, some critics maintain that the true protagonist of the Tragedy is Lucifer himself, being more active than Adam and God combined. Milton offers a more well-rounded Lucifer, however; he is motivated chiefly by a desire for power, and all his actions stem from that, rather than from any specifically malicious drive. Mad√°ch's version is significantly more one-sidedly villainous, seeking to destroy mankind simply to prove God's creation experiment a failure. This spite, combined with his charisma in dealing with Adam and Eve, make him a decidedly sinister character, more so than Milton's. Some critics suggest that the unique portrayal of Eve, the first woman, was prompted by Mad√°ch's own unhappy marriage. Eve is both the vehicle of Adam's fall, offering him the apple, but through her appearance in each scene, is also usually the means by which Adam regains his hope for the future. In the end, she is the force which prevents his demise. The relationship between man and woman is indeed at the heart of the play, portrayed as being both deeply flawed on the one hand, yet still affirmed as the basic human relationship. While these interpretations may be up for discussion, the role of Hegelian dialectic in the sequencing of scenes is an established fact. Each scene, each historical period, is the realization of some ideal of Adam (thesis), which Lucifer then exposes as being deeply flawed (antithesis). Adam, on the verge of losing hope, comes into contact with Eve, and decides upon a new ideal (synthesis) which would cure the worst problems of his present reality. The cycle then repeats. But each time Lucifer shows an age to Adam, he deceives Adam: Lucifer always shows the age not when the new ideal was ascending and contributed to the well-being of the human race. Instead, Lucifer and Adam experience the declining phase of the ages. Thus, contrary to Hegel's philosophy, what Adam sees is that humanity does not constantly build towards a glorious future, but is slowly sinking into worse and worse depravity. This leads to the most famous and one of the most controversial elements of the play. Adam cannot understand what the purpose of his existence is if mankind's future is so bleak. The last line is spoken by God: \\"Mondottam, ember, k√ºzdj √©s b√≠zva b√≠zz√°l!\\" (\\"I have told you, Man: strive on, and trust!\\") Depending on the interpretation, this can either be seen cynically as the words of a capricious deity, or else pointing to a \\"hope beyond all hope,\\" that God has a purpose for all things which man may not necessarily comprehend. This is markedly different from Paradise Lost, where the Christian hope is explicitly spelled out. It may therefore be tempting to suggest that The Tragedy of Man is not really a Christian play. It is, in fact, rather critical of historical Christianity. However, it is really only the institutional Roman Catholic Church that comes under direct attack. His brief portrayal of the early church, and St. Peter specifically, is also completely positive.B√°sti, Lajos. Mire gondolsz √Åd√°m?. (Budapest: Magvet≈ë K√∂nyvkiad√≥, 1962). It is certain that Mad√°ch's contemporaries likewise saw the play as unquestionably Christian in character. J√°nos Arany, who proofread Mad√°ch's poetry, was at first so disgusted by Lucifer's apparent blasphemous behaviour in the first scene that he refused to read further; however, once Mad√°ch begged him to read it to the end, he felt that the rest of the play's Christianity justified and explained what he had at first misinterpreted. Therefore, the interpretation of God as a capricious and arbitrary deity who wants to see his creations toil and suffer for no purpose does not seem to fit with Mad√°ch's probable intentions. Literary influence, notably from Milton's Paradise Lost and Goethe's Faust, cannot be overlooked. Both notably contributed to the representation of the Lucifer, that takes characteristics from both Milton's Satan and Goethe's Mephistopheles. Likewise, existentialist themes reflecting on the apparent absurdity of existence are present throughout; Kierkegaard's influence can also be inferred, especially in the ending, which affirms both the world's meaninglessness and the meaningfulness of striving for God. Adaptations=Stage The poem is quite suitable for the stage, but a bit lengthy. German, Czech and Polish theaters have staged adaptations. Opera There are also two operas based on the play: a two-act mystery opera (\\"Az ember trag√©di√°ja\\") by the Hungarian composer Gy√∂rgy R√°nki and a very large-scale work by the English composer Clive Strutt (\\"The Tragedy of Man\\"). Animation Marcell Jankovics has directed the animated film The Tragedy of Man, produced from 1988 to 2011 at Pannonia Film Studio. Some of the segments were showcased individually over the years, and the finished 160-minute feature film was finally released in 2011. Cinema Directed by Andr√°s Jeles, Angyali √ºdv√∂zlet (The Annunciation) was released in 1984, in which children play all the characters.

His family moved to Galway, and he grew up there. After completing his secondary education at St Joseph's College, Galway (The 'Bish') and Mungret College, Limerick, he enrolled at University College Dublin in 1900, did an Arts degree and then studied medicine. He transferred to University College Galway and graduated in 1913. He was a member of the college Literary and Debating Society and participated in drama. He began his medical career in the County Infirmary in Galway, and then moved to Holles Street. He joined the Royal Army Medical Corps, and was badly affected by mustard gas in India. After the war he settled in Leicester, where he spent the rest of his career as a neurological specialist. Colahan was also a composer of popular songs. His most famous work is \\"Galway Bay\\", which, popularised by Bing Crosby, was the biggest selling record of all time at one stage. Theories abound as to where the song was written or where it was first heard. Some say it was in the home of Dr Morris at 1 Montpelier Terrace, while others believe it was in The Vicars Croft on Taylor's Hill, from where one could see Galway Bay. Other songs written by Colahan included Maccushla Mine, Asthoreen Bawn, Until God's Day, The Kylemore Pass and The Claddagh Ring.

(2008) Sponsored search: An overview of the concept, history, and technology, International Journal of Electronic Business. 6(2), 114 ‚Äì 131. Search advertisements are targeted to match key search terms (called keywords) entered on search engines. This targeting ability has contributed to the attractiveness of search advertising for advertisers. Consumers will often use a search engine to identify and compare purchasing options immediately before making a purchasing decision. The opportunity to present consumers with advertisements tailored to their immediate buying interests encourages consumers to click on search ads instead of unpaid search results, which are often less relevant. For the online user, Sponsored Search Advertisement offers highly relevant search results which are based on the consumer‚Äôs own queries and, thus, they are considered less intrusive than banner advertisements or pop-ups advertising. In addition, Sponsored Search Advertisement reduces online user search costs and increases the accessibility to useful information within a limited time frame. Consequently, Sponsored Search Advertisement has become an important element of online users browsing and information searching experiences on the Web. Search advertising is an alternative to SEO and SEM. __TOC__ Origins Web advertising before 1998 consisted of banner advertisements generally priced by the number of impressions delivered (i.e., Cost-Per-milli (CPM) pricing).

The user interested in the product or service searches using a specific keyword or search term which lets them interact with advertiser's website. Search engines conduct running auctions to sell ads according to bids received for keywords and relative relevance of user keywords to ads in the inventory. The keyword ‚Äúhome mortgage refinancing\\" is more expensive than one that is in less demand, such as ‚Äúused bicycle tires.‚Äù Profit potential of the keywords also plays into bids for ads that advertisers want displayed when the keywords are searched by the user. For example, \\"used book\\" may be a popular keyword but may have low profit potential and the advertiser bids will reflect that. Search engines build indexes of Web pages using a Web crawler. When the publisher of a Web page arranges with a search engine firm to have ads served up on that page, the search engine applies their indexing technology to associate the content of that page with keywords. Those keywords are then fed into the same auctioning system that is used by advertisers to buy ads on both search engine results pages. Advertising based on keywords in the surrounding content or context is referred to as Contextual advertising. This is usually less profitable than search advertising which is based on user intent expressed through their keywords. Advertisers can choose whether to buy ads on search result pages (search advertising), published content pages (contextual advertising), or both. Bids on the same keywords are usually higher in search advertising than in contextual advertising. In 2013, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held in Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc. that online contact lens seller Lens.com did not commit trademark infringement when it purchased search advertisements using competitor 1-800 Contacts' federally registered 1800 CONTACTS trademark as a keyword. In August 2016, the Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint against 1-800 Contacts alleging, among other things, that its search advertising trademark enforcement practices have unreasonably restrained competition in violation of the FTC Act. 1-800 Contacts has denied all wrongdoing and is scheduled to appear before an FTC administrative law judge in April 2017.David O. Klein & Joshua R. Wueller, Trademark Enforcement and Internet Search Advertising: A Regulatory Risk for Brand Owners, IP Litigator, Nov./Dec. 2016. Metrics Search advertising activities can be measured in five ways: CPM: Cost per thousand viewers was the original method used for pricing online advertisements. CPM remains the most common method for pricing banner ads. CTR: Click-through rates measure the number of times an ad is clicked as a percentage of views of the Web page on which the ad appears. Banner ads have CTRs that are generally 0.5 percent or less. In comparison, individual search engine ads can have CTRs of 10 percent, even though they appear alongside organic search results and competing paid search advertisements.Search Advertising Campaign Management, E-Commerce Times, June 27, 2007. CPA: Cost per action quantifies costs for completing specified activities such as attracting a new customer or making a sale. Affiliate networks operate on a CPA basis. CPA systems function most effectively when sales cycles are short and easily tracked. Longer sales cycles rely on exposure to multiple types of ads to create brand awareness and purchasing interest before a sale is made. Longer sales cycles and sales requiring multiple customer contacts can be difficult to track, leading to a reluctance by publishers to participate in CPA programs beyond initial lead generation. CPC: Cost per click tracks the cost of interacting with a client or potential client. In traditional marketing, CPC is viewed as a one-way process of reaching target audiences through means such as direct mail, radio ads and television ads. Search advertising provides opportunities for two-way contacts through web-based chat, Internet-based calls, call-back requests or mailing list sign-ups. There are some guidelines to establish minimum acceptable counting procedure for clicks. Each and every click has a life cycle which is known as click referral cycle. It comprises four stages: Initiated click, Measured click, Received click and Resolved click.Click Measurement Guidelines, Version 1.0, May 12, 2009 TM: Total minutes is a metric being used by Nielsen/NetRatings to measure total time spent on a Web page rather than the number of Web page views. On July 10, 2007, Nielsen announced that they would be relying on TM as their primary metric for measuring Web page popularity, due to changes in the way Web pages provide content through audio and video streaming and by refreshing the same page without totally reloading it.New Web metric likely to hurt Google, help YouTube Nielsen/NetRatings to use total time spent by users of a site as its primary measurement metric, by Heather Havenstein, Computerworld, July 10, 2007. Page refreshes are one aspect of Rich Internet Applications (RIA). RIA technologies include AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and Microsoft Silverlight. Methodological questions regarding the use of total minutes for search advertising include how to account for Internet users that keep several browser windows open simultaneously, or who simply leave one window open unattended for long periods of time. Another question involves tracking total minutes on HTML pages that are stateless and do therefore do not generate server-side data on the length of time that they are viewed.New Web Metric Likely To Hurt Google, Slashdot, Monday July 09, 2007. Campaign management Search engine advertisements are purchased on the basis of keywords. Ad buyers engage in running actions for keywords, with popular keywords costing several dollars per click through. Search engines use algorithms to determine the position of ads according to click through rates. Ads with poor click through rates can be pushed down to the bottom of the first page of search results or onto subsequent pages. Even though advertisers are only paying for click throughs, the algorithms assigning ad positions based on ad popularity provide incentives for optimizing keyword selection and other cost control measures.Jansen, B. J., Liu, Z., and Simon, Z. (2013) The Effect of Ad Rank on Performance of Keyword Advertising Campaigns. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 64(10), 2115-2132. Without cost control measures, it is possible for ad buyers to spend twenty five to fifty percent of their ad budget ineffectively. Cost control measures can include: * Campaigns can begin slowly, so as to test the effectiveness of keywords and ad texts. It can take three months of testing before a campaign is ready to scale up. Beginning campaigns can spend US$20‚Äì$40 per day, whereas major campaigns can exceed US$1000 per day. Multiple campaigns can be run alongside each other. * Negative keywords can be used to exclude search queries that do not relate to the ads to be shown. A seller of replacement windows for buildings, for example, could use the negative keywords ‚Äòsoftware‚Äô or ‚Äòprograms‚Äô to avoid their ads appearing in response to search queries for information about Microsoft Windows software. * Word order within keyword combinations can have an effect on click through rates. Word order in buying ads according to keywords can be controlled through the use of quotation marks. Continuing the above example from the perspective of a seller of replacement windows, the keyword ‚Äúreplacement window‚Äù may have a higher click through rate than ‚Äúwindows replacement‚Äù or for related keyword combinations where syntax is not specified and that could be associated with Microsoft Windows software rather than windows for buildings. * Broad search means that an ad is served up in response to any search query that contains the keyword, regardless of any other words that may have been used in the search query. Eliminating broad search can be helpful in cases where there are a large number of potential keywords or where the advertiser seeks to keep ad spending at a minimum. A replacement window company located in Trenton, New Jersey could eliminate broad search in favor of location-specific keywords such as ‚Äúreplacement windows Trenton‚Äù and other locations within their market area. Each search engine has its own procedures for controlling broad search options for individual keywords. * It takes time to identify and select potential keywords. Rather than bidding on a small number of popular keywords, advertisers can expand their keyword lists to more than 200 and seek to include keywords that their competitors are not utilizing. Keywords that are less sought after are cheaper. To identify keyword options, enter ‚Äòkeyword tool‚Äô into a search engine. The use of competitors' trademarks as keywords has been controversial in the U.S. and around the world. * The use of one own's trademark as a keyword has been controversial as well, but research shows that there are plenty of advantages in using that method not just for dominating search results pages with SEO and PPC and preventing competitors from taking advantage of it, but also for increasing the number of clicks the brand is getting; the combined clicks from SEO and PPC would exceed the clicks of SEO even if the brand's SEO has the first position for its brand keywords. * Search advertising campaigns can produce immediate results‚Äîbut they often need immediate attention. Poorly performing ads need to be pulled, keyword lists adjusted, and bid amounts modified to prevent over-spending. * Perform market research with search analytics services in order to identify market trends and opportunities. These services often reveal what keywords are profitable for other websites in your target market. In addition, they show seasonal and emerging keywords allowing you to plan a more timely marketing campaign.

History The school fully opened to 13‚Äì16 years in 1977, under the leadership of its first Headmaster was Dr Morris. The largest school in the Metropolitan borough of Rochdale, it taught over 1000 students. The school buildings also included the Grace Fileds theatre, a 25-metre swimming pool, tennis courts and extensive fields for football and rugby. In 2003 the school merged with Rydings Special School, a local school for children with disabilities. The merger required a complete reconstruction of the school, which began in 2005 and finished in 2008, and involved the redevelopment of the current site as well as an entirely new building being built on the former playing fields and tennis courts. The Oulder Hill School building remains with the same name and Rydings Special School has been named Redwood Secondary school. The building is now owned by OPERON and the school pays ¬£1 million a year to rent the school from 6 am to 6 pm.

The town is located about north of Dublin city centre. Toponymy The name \\"Lusk\\" is said to date back to Saint MacCullin, who founded a church there c. 450. Oral tradition suggests MacCullin may have either lived in or been buried in a cave and that the name \\"Lusk\\" derives from an old Irish word Lusca meaning 'cave' or 'underground chamber'. MacCullin died in c. 497 and his feast day was 6 September. The area was known as Bregia in pre-Christian times and was said to have been birthplace to C√∫ Chulainn's wife, Emer in Irish mythology. History The settlement of Lusk has been associated with St. MacCullin since c. AD 450. The place also had associations with St. Maur, who nowadays connects with Rush (RosEo). The ruins of St. Maur's original church, or more likely its later replacement, are at the top of Whitestown hill, firmly in the parish of Rush. Lusk was plundered and burned several times in the 8th and 9th centuries by marauding Vikings, who eventually built a permanent settlement at Dubh Linn, now Dublin. The only tangible remnant of the early Christian foundation at Lusk is the round tower. It is adjacent to a Norman square tower built against it in the 15th century. This building has three matching (smaller) towers at its corners. The square tower holds several medieval tombs including that of James Bermingham (1527) and the double-effigy tomb of Christopher Barnewall and his wife Marion Sherle (1589). The Church of Ireland church dates from 1847 by Joseph Welland, and was designed in an Early English Gothic style. While standing on the right side of the castle looking up one of the bricks in the building has a stone image of St. Macullin's face. View from 1791 Post Office Road, off Skerries Road, in Lusk The round tower at Lusk was built in the 10th or 11th century. It stands 27 m high (originally nearly 32 m high). Inside are nine storeys including the basement making it highest number of any round tower. Each floor is lit by single-lintelled windows which vary in size. Two of these windows have been blocked up where they face unto the wall of the belfry. Just under the cap there are 4 windows facing the cardinal points. They are quite small and narrow. The original conical cap has been replaced by a flat timber roof. The flat-headed doorway, which originally would have been some 2.6 m above the ground level is now less than 1 m above the ground. Fingal is the name given to that part of present-day North County Dublin bounded by the Tolka River to the south and the Delvin River to the north. Fingal is considerably older than Dublin City, which was established by the Norsemen c. 900 AD around the 'dubh linn' or black pool. Before Christendom and St. MacCullin, the area was the Celtic \\"Bregia\\", birthplace of C√∫ Chullain's wife, Emer whose clan resided in or near what we now know as Lusk. Lusca Irish Wine named after the Irish for Lusk, by Llewellyns Orchard, is one of the few Irish Wine producer using grapes grown in Ireland. On 26 May 2005 there was an attempted armed robbery of Lusk Post office. During this attempted robbery two gang members were shot dead by Garda√≠. The total incident lasted 20 seconds. In 2007 a third gang member was given a 10-year jail sentence for his role in the deadly raid. To facilitate the increased population in this part of north county Dublin a new, larger, state-of-the-art post office was opened in 2016. The license was transferred from the early 20th century post office on Post Office Road to the new facilities on Station Road. Population 220px The population of the village has quadrupled since the turn of the 21st century, with people coming from Dublin city, other parts of the EU, Africa, South America and parts of Asia. According to the Central Statistical Office, 62% of all private dwellings in Lusk were built in the five years between 2001 and 2006. Census figures for the same period show a doubling of population boom from c.2, 500 to over 5, 200. During most of the 20th century, the population remained fairly static. Census returns for 1901 and 1911 show a population boom from about 300 to 600. Figures are available for Lusk, Dublin from the early 1950s that show a population of 513 for the village. Due to massive emigration in Ireland throughout the 1950s and 1960s the population of Lusk declined. In the mid-1950s for instance, the total number of children in the old NS, boys and girls, never was higher than 120. The National School opened in 1956 with that number. This primary school was replaced in 2018. The new building is located slightly north of the site of the former 1950's building, which was demolished to allow construction. Amenities There are four national schools in the area: Lusk NS, Hedgestown NS, Corduff NS and Rush and Lusk Educate Together NS. In August 2013 these were complemented by a secondary-level education institute, Lusk Community College. The Educate Together school was the subject of adverse findings on fire safety in 2015, concluding that the building was secure for only 20 minutes in the event of fire, rather than the required 60 minutes, and over 800,000 euro of works had to be done. Problems later arose with other schools built by the same firm, Western Building Systems. There were two overriding concerns that prompted a public backlash: the lack of cavity barriers in walls and the non-existence of special intumescent paint. Lusk Community Council Ltd (LCC) was set up to look after the village and liaise with local government and councillors. LCC is a voluntary organisation whose responsibility has been to manage the Carnegie Library hall and the Old Church hall by the round tower. They also run the St Patrick‚Äôs Day parade each year. The village accommodates many different social clubs and activities: * Lusk United AFC soccer club * The Round Towers GAA club * 153rd Lusk Scouts * Lusk Judo club * The Black Raven pipe band * Lusk branch of the Irish Countrywomen's Association * Lusk Kick-boxing Club * Lusk Athletics Club * Lusk Heritage Group * Lusk Tidy Towns group * Lusk Golf Society * Drama School * Lusk Senior Citizens‚Äô Group * Lusk St Vincent de Paul Society Martin Finnegan Memorial, LuskLusk is home to a number road motorbike races, with major annual motorcycle road races, such as the Skerries 100 and Killalane Road Races, in the area. A well-known road racer from the area, Martin Finnegan was killed in a tragic accident at the Tandragee 100.. A memorial to Martin Finnegan was dedicated close to the grounds of his parish church. Also in his memory the Martin Finnegan Trophy is awarded to the fastest lap by an Irishman at the Isle of Man TT. Religion St. MacCullin‚Äôs Catholic Church serves as the parish church for the locality. St. MacCullins Church of Ireland church now houses Lusk Heritage Centre. The Church of Ireland parish of Lusk is now grouped for administrative purposes with St. Columba's of Swords Transport The railway station of Rush & Lusk is about 2km east and is shared with the coastal settlement of Rush. The Dublin Bus routes 33, 33a (taken over by Go- Ahead Ireland on 2 December 2018) and 33x also run through the area. Fingal Express is a privately owned coach service from Skerries, Rush and Lusk to Dublin City Centre and UCD.  Twinning  Lusk is twinned with Thorign√©- Fouillard located in Brittany, France. The twinning process was completed on Sunday, May 2nd, 1993. On April 27th 2011, a delegation of 27 visitors from the Breton region arrived in Lusk and were greeted by the Mayor of Fingal, Cllr Ken Farrell.

He played college football at Amherst College. Early years Born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, he skipped two grades as a youngster. He attended Cardinal Gibbons School, where he started playing football as a senior, becoming a two-way player (tight end and defensive end). He graduated in 1968 and was named the Baltimore Catholic Athlete of the Year, the first black athlete to be given the award. Fugett accepted an academic scholarship to Amherst College in Massachusetts, because he wanted to go to a school where he could play both basketball and football. As a senior in 1971, he led the team in receiving and scoring with 39 receptions for 635 yards and 9 touchdowns, while earning Little All-American honors. Professional career=Dallas Cowboys Fugett was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the thirteenth round (338th overall) of the 1972 NFL Draft. The Cowboys carried only two tight ends on the roster in those years, but saw potential in the 20-year-old rookie and made an exception by adding him as the third one. As a rookie, he was the backup behind future hall of famer Mike Ditka, after passing an injured Billy Truax on the depth chart. He was used mostly on passing downs and finished with 7 receptions for 94 yards. In 1973, Billy Joe DuPree was taken in the first round of that year's draft and became the starter at tight end. Fugett remained as the backup tight end, collecting 9 receptions for 168 yards and 3 touchdowns, leading the team with an 18.7-yard average per reception. In 1974, as the backup behind Dupree, he appeared in 12 games with 2 starts. He made 4 receptions for 60 yards and one touchdown. In 1975, Fugett started nine games in place of an injured DuPree. He was the team's second leading receiver (behind Drew Pearson), with 38 receptions for 488 yards and three touchdowns. He also started Super Bowl X against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Washington Redskins After the courts ruled in favor of the National Football League Players Association, a new form of free agency was briefly instituted in 1976. Fugett signed as a free agent with the Washington Redskins and was looked upon as the replacement of former All-Pro Jerry Smith. He was named the starter over Smith, finishing with 27 receptions (tied for third on the team) for 334 yards (third on the team) and 6 receiving touchdowns (led the team). In 1977, he led the team with 36 receptions for 631 yards, a 17.5-yard average and 5 touchdowns. At the end of the year, he was tied with the St. Louis Cardinals' J. V. Cain in Pro Bowl votes, but edged him based on the team records. In the offseason, he underwent surgery to repair torn cartilage in his left knee. In 1978, he appeared in 14 games with 12 starts, making 25 receptions for 367 yards and 7 receiving touchdowns (led the team). In 1979, he was limited with a knee injury and started 6 games, before being replaced in the starting lineup with rookie Don Warren. He retired prior to the 1980 season, after he did not receive a contract offer from the Redskins. Personal life During his time with the Redskins, Fugett earned his J.D.https://www.martindale.com/attorney/jean-s-fugett-jr-620496/ degree at the George Washington University Law School, attending school only at night. After his eighth year as an all pro tight end in the NFL and passing the Maryland state bar exam, he made the decision of joining his older brother Reginald Lewis in business. While working with Lewis, Fugett largely contributed the founding of TLC Group in 1983. From there he served as Director and Vice-Chair of the McCall Pattern Company Management Committee, as founding partner of a Baltimore law firm, and as a partner with Fanfone in Europe. After the death of his brother in 1993, Fugett took over TLC Beatrice International Foods, the largest black-owned and black managed business in the United States at the time. At its peak, TLC Beatrice had $2.2 billion in sales and was number 512 on Fortune magazine‚Äôs list of 1,000 largest. In addition to his law practice, Fugett is the most recent past President of the Retired Players Steering Committee of the National Football League Players Association, as legal counsel and advisor to Wall Street investment services firm GFS Acquisition Partners, Managing Director of Axum Capital Partners, and on the Leadership Council for the American Diabetes Association Maryland Chapter. Fugett currently resides in Baltimore with his wife Carlotta. His two sons are Joseph \\"Russell\\" and Reginald. His only daughter Audie married Adam Jones in late-December 2014.

As Imperial Premier, Kydones' West-Politik effort during his second and third stints was to bring about a reconciliation of the Byzantine and Roman Churches, in order to cement a military alliance against the ever-encroaching Islam, a program that culminated in Emperor John V Palaiologos' reconciliation with Catholicism. His younger brother and somewhat-collaborator in his efforts was the noted anti-Palamite theologian Prochoros Kydones.

Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos, a staunch follower of Palamism, the Hesychast doctrine of Gregory Palamas, had befriended Demetrios Kydones as a young man and had employed him as his Imperial Premier or Mesazon (1347‚Äì1354) at the age of 23; at the Emperor's request, Kydones began to translate Western polemical works against Islam, such as the writings of the Dominican Ricoldo da Monte Croce, from Latin into Greek, and which the Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos used as references in his own writings against Muhammad and Islam (although his own daughter was married to the Turkish Muslim Emir Orhan of Bithynia). At Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos' urging, Kydones acquired knowledge of Latin, and learned to speak, read and write it well. This led Kydones to undertake a deeper study of Latin theology, particularly St. Thomas Aquinas, and he attempted to introduce his compatriots to Thomistic Scholasticism by translating some of Aquinas' writings into Greek. John VI Kantakouzenos also encouraged him in his Latin studies and he himself read some Thomist literature. However, this put Demetrios Kydones on a journey that eventually ended with his conversion to Catholicism. Anxious to concentrate on his Latin studies, Kydones retired for a time to private life from the Imperial Premiership in 1354, just before John V Palaiologos succeeded in ousting John VI Kantakouzenos. When Kydones entered the service of Emperor John V Palaiologos, as he soon did, he remained friendly to his former employer Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos. On the other hand, he found himself unable or unwilling to follow the Palamist doctrine espoused by John VI Kantakouzenos. His younger brother Prochoros Kydones was a monk on Mt. Athos, and he too learned Latin, but did not follow Demetrios to Rome. Prochoros admired and translated some of the works of Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas, but parted company with Kantakouzenos by becoming an argumentative anti-Palamite. On retiring from public office in 1354, Demetrios Kydones went to Italy where he studied the writings of the leading medieval philosophical theologians, and made Greek translations of the major works of Western writers, including tracts by Augustine of Hippo (5th century) and Thomas Aquinas' Summa theologica. By 1365 he had made a profession of faith in the Catholic Church.Donald M. Nicol, The Reluctant Emperor Second Premiership In 1369, Emperor John V Palaiologos recalled Kydones to Constantinople and named him Imperial Prime Minister or Mesazon, the second time he held this position, 1369-1383. At the same time, Patriarch Philotheos Kokkinos of Constantinople was removed and his deposed predecessor Patriarch Kallistos of Constantinople restored. At that point, things began to take a bad turn for the Palamites. John V did not cherish such tender feelings towards them as did Kantakouzenos and his son the Emperor Matthew Kantakouzenos; instead, he saw their doctrines as an obstacle to the union of the Churches which he envisaged as a way of obtaining help from the Pope and Western rulers against the Turks. Thus, the persecuting measures that had been taken against the Anti-Palamites after the synod of Blachernae of 1351 were rescinded, and Nikephoros Gregoras was able to come and go freely to his cloister. In the course of the year 1355, the Emperor John V Palaiologos called Nikephoros Gregoras to hold a public disputation with Gregory Palamas, in his own presence and that of the papal legate, Paul of Smyrna. In the ensuing years, the imperial government of John V Palaiologos refused to involve itself, in a practical way, in the intestine quarrel that still divided minds; but the patriarch and the episcopate were henceforth wedded to Palamism and Hesychasm, and sanctions of a religious nature continued to be leveled against anyone who showed hostility to them. One of these sanctions was the deprivation of church burial. Patriarch Kallistos, who died in August 1363, was succeeded once again by Philotheos Kokkinos on February 12, 1364; Kokkinos had been reconciled with John V Palaiologos through the good offices of Demetrios Kydones as part of an agreement restoring Philotheos Kokkinos to the Patriarchy; according to the terms of this agreement, Patriarch Philotheos was to allow those who did not subscribe to the Palamite doctrine to live in peace. But Philotheos, a fervent disciple of Palamas, did not keep his promise for long, and in 1368 he moved to crack down on Demetrios Kydones' own brother Prochoros, a monk and priest at Mount Athos. Prochoros was a formidable adversary to the Palamites. It is to him, and not to Gregory Akindynos that one must ascribe the work De essentia et operatione, in six books, of which only the first and the beginning of the second have been published (cf. PG 151, 1191‚Äì1242). It gives a true summary of Thomistic theology; Barlaam of Seminara himself never wrote anything as plain and forceful. Prochoros also composed other treatises and shorter works, such as On the light of Tabor, On the Anti-Barlaamite Synodal Tome of 1351, etc. Accused before Patriarch Philotheos Kokkinos and called to adhere to official Palamite orthodoxy, he continued to argue against it. Finally, in April 1368, Philotheos Kokkinos gathered a synod against Prochoros Kydones. In spite of the delicate handling he received and the delays that were employed to bring him back to his senses, he remained unshakable in his convictions, and appeared a number of times more or less openly to mock his judges. In the end, they pronounced against him in his absence -- for he did not show up at the final session -- a sentence of excommunication and of perpetual suspension from the priesthood. A long tome was put together on that occasion; it concludes with a decree declaring the canonization of Gregory Palamas.Text in PG 151, 693-716, following the edition of Dositheus in the Œ§œåŒºŒøœÇ ·ºÄŒ≥Œ¨œÄŒ∑œÇ, Bucharest 1698, Prolegomena, pp. 93‚Äì114 The Tome of 1368 brings to an end the series of Palamite councils, with the Greek Church's canonization of Palamas, and with the establishment of the second Sunday of Lent as his feast, confirming once more the triumph of his doctrine in the Greek Church. The doctrine nevertheless met with strong opposition, even during the latter part of the fourteenth century, by authors like John Kyparissiotes and Manuel Kalekas, who continued the earlier critiques of Palamism by men like Gregory Akindynos and Nikephoros Gregoras. Contrary to Byzantine tradition, the reigning emperor, John V Palaiologos, unable to accept the teachings of Palamas, distanced himself from his Church's own theology and eventually abandoned it by making profession in 1369 of the Catholic faith. In the spring of 1369 John V Palaiologos set sail from Constantinople with Demetrios Kydones and a large retinue. The destination was Italy; their immediate goal was to meet with Pope Urban V and his cardinals in Rome. The purpose of that extraordinary journey, however, and the subsequent meetings between Pope and Emperor in the fall of that year, was twofold: to assure Pope Urban V that the Byzantine Emperor was no longer a schismatic, and to persuade the Pope and his Curia to support a new military initiative that would aid the Byzantines in fending off the ever-increasing threat to the Empire from the Ottoman Turks. Kydones' efforts culminated in Emperor John V's profession of faith as a Catholic in the presence of the Pope and cardinals in Rome on October 18, 1369. However, with the weakening of Byzantine resistance to the Turks, Kydones retired to private life about 1383. In 1390 he journeyed to Venice, which helped introduce Greek culture to Italy, and is credited with fostering the nascent Renaissance. He formed, moreover, the nucleus of a group of Byzantine intellectuals that strove to propagate Uniatism. Third Premiership Recalled to Constantinople in 1391 by his former pupil Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, the son of Emperor John V Palaiologos, Kydones resumed the position of Prime Minister (\\"Mesazon\\"), but in 1396 hostility to his Catholicism compelled him to retire permanently to the island of Crete, then ruled by the Venetians. He died there the following year, in 1398. Anti- Palamism With the support of his younger brother Prochoros, Demetrios opposed as polytheistic or pantheistic the Palamites' commitment to hesychasm (Greek, silence or stillness), at the time a controversial practice of mystical contemplation through uninterrupted prayer, taught by the Orthodox monks of Mount Athos and articulated by the 14th-century ascetic theologian Gregory Palamas. Applying Aristotelian logic to hesychasm (sometimes claimed by Latin critics to be rooted in Platonism),biblewiki.be/ the Kydones brothers accused Palamas of promoting pantheism or polytheism, only to be condemned themselves by three successive synods that concurred with Palamas' theology and affirmed hesychastic practice. He is the author of the moral philosophical essay De contemnenda morte (\\"On Despising Death\\"), an Apologia for his conversion to Catholicism, and a voluminous collection of 447 letters, valuable for the history of Byzantine relations with the West. One of the principal documentary sources for the Eastern Roman Empire's gradual submission to the Turks is Kydones' Symbouleutikoi (\\"Exhortations\\"), urging the Byzantine people to unite with the Latins in order to resist the Turkish onslaught.  Against the Greek Schism  Kydones' most famous statement against the Greeks who opposed his efforts at reuniting the East and the West is from his Apologia: :\\"So when someone comes along and says the Pope is in error and everyone ought to abjure such error, we really have been given no proof for such an allegation, and it makes no sense for anyone to pass judgment on what has first to be proven. What is more, we will not succeed in finding out why and by whom the Pope is to be judged, no matter how earnestly we try. But aside from the prospect that the one who has the Primacy in the Church is in error, what confidence can be placed in those of lower rank? If we continue to carry on like this, all shepherds of the Christian people will become suspect because what we accuse the Head Shepherd of is even more likely to befall all those who are less than he. Would not every matter of faith have to end with a question mark if there indeed be no final seat of authority in the Church? There can be no certitude anywhere, if none is worthy of credibility. Then we are no longer talking about the religion which St. Paul described as one; rather there will be as many religions as there are leaders, or worse still, none at all! Every believer will suspect everyone else and will proceed to pick and choose whatever belief suits him. Then, as in a battle fought in the dark, we will be striking at our own friends, and they at us. How the non-believers will enjoy our antics, because we Christians are now engaged in endless bickering among ourselves, since none of us wants to concede anything to anyone else. The whole missionary effort to spread Christian beliefs will be stopped in its tracks since no one will pay any attention to those who cannot even agree among themselves.\\"Demetrios Kydones, Apologia References External links  Downloadable Greek OCR of Heinrich Deckelmann's Teubner edition of De contemnenda morte oratio (1901) from the Lace collection at Mount Allison University. *Encyclop√¶dia Britannica *Martin A.

Conservation status The species is thought to naturally occur in only 22 localities and is endemic to the British Isles. It is listed as a nationally scarce British species and is in serious risk of extinction. The species was once abundant on the Isle of Man, hence its name, however, for an unknown reason its population has collapsed to only a few individual and isolated plants. On the Isle of Man, the Manx Wildlife Trust began propagating the species in their greenhouses in 2006. It is hoped that this will halt the decline of the species and prevent its extinction. Habitat The plant prefers light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, which must be well-drained yet moist. The plant can grow in acidic, neutral and alkaline soils, in semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. Coincya monensis subsp. monensis needs mobile sand dunes where wind or other erosion prevents thick vegetation cover and allows areas free from vegetation cover for C. m. subsp. monensis to colonise. Trampling by walkers can help achieve this habitat, hence C. m. monensis can often be found growing along footpaths through coastal dunes. Biology The Isle-of-Man cabbage, a dicot plant is biennial and grows to a height of 0.3 metres. It forms rosettes than can be up to a metre in diameter. The flowers have four leaves, are hermaphrodite and are pollinated by insects. Coincya monensis subsp monensis flowers from April. Taxonomy Other subspecies in the genus Coincya are the Lundy cabbage, Coincya wrightii, and the star mustard, Coincya monensis subsp. recurvata. The star mustard, a plant introduced to eight U.S. states, is the same species as the Isle of Man cabbage but a different subspecies. It may have been introduced to the U.S. as the Isle-of Man cabbage and subsequently evolved through the founder effect and geographic isolation into a new subspecies. The Manx name for the species is , literally 'Manx cabbage'. Outside the British Isles, the Isle of Man cabbage is also known as the star mustard, wallflower cabbage, tall wallflower cabbage and coincya. In its scientific name, the specific descriptor is Latin for Manx. In Latin, the Isle of Man is called . References *Clapham, Tutin and Warburg. Flora of the British Isles.

History The history of Aldworth school can be traced back to 1646, when the Blue Coat School was opened in Cross Street (originally Cow Cross Lane). It was due to an Alderman of the City of London named Richard Aldworth (whose mother, Jane South, was from Basingstoke) that the school was able to open, when he left ¬£2000 in his will. The school provided education for ten boys from underprivileged backgrounds. The boys would be educated, clothed and fed from the age of 7 until they 16, when they would be found jobs or enrolled in apprenticeship schemes. The school got its name from the distinctive uniforms the boys wore. In 1811, the Blue Coat school was incorporated into the National Schools system and forced to share its building with National boys. The master at the time William Brown (1801‚Äì1814) complained that it was not cost efficient to continue to educate the Blue Coat boys. In 1862, the school was rebuilt to accommodate 292 children, including girls who transferred from the National School in Church Square. However, standards in the school continued to decline and in 1876 the decision was taken to close the Blue Coat school after the remaining six pupil were placed in 1879. The building continued to be used as a school until 1896, when it closed due to bankruptcy and the building was leased to a shoemaker and eventually sold to the 'Aldworth Printing Works' in 1926. The building was demolished during the town development in 1966. In 1994, on the site of the old school, a statue of a 'Blue Coat Boy' was unveiled. This statue was cast from a mould of another statue at the larger Blue Coat School in Reading, also founded by Richard Aldworth. A new school was built in 1963 on Western Way called Richard Aldworth School and a stone plaque from the Old Blue Coat School building was incorporated in the main entrance. However, this is the only historical connection the Western Way school has with the old Blue Coat school. This later became Richard Aldworth Community School. In 2005, the school gained status as a Specialist Science College and changed its name to Aldworth Science College. In 2013, the government Specialist School scheme ended and the school's name became Aldworth School. Due to funding from earning the science status, certain areas of the school have been redeveloped. Major work was carried out over the summer of 2008, including the renovation of the three-storey Dartmouth Block to make it easily accessible for disabled students. An extension was added to the building during the academic year 2011‚Äì12 to house a new drama studio. Curriculum Students in the school are placed in classes determined by their ability within the subject area. In Year 7, this is determined by Key Stage 2 SATS results. The sets are flexible and students are periodically moved in line with their progress. At Key Stage 4, students can select subjects to study alongside the compulsory subjects of English, Mathematics, Science, ICT, PSHVE and Physical Education.  Headteachers Ifor David Trevor-Jones (1963 -1977) The first headteacher at Richard Aldworth. Students on roll went from 210 to 1700 in his time as headteacher. He retired at the end of the 1977/78 autumn term. Peter Sayer (1978 -1989) Peter Sayer moved to Basingstoke from the Cotswolds in 1978 to take up the Headship at Richard Aldworth. During his time there, the school grew to become the largest secondary school in Basingstoke. Michael Ward 1990 ‚Äì 2000 Michael Ward became the headteacher after moving from the headship of a smaller school in Southampton. During his time the community provision grew substantially and the school grew to just short of 1000 pupils. He retired in the summer of 2000. Julie Churcher (2000‚Äì2012) Julie Churcher retired at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 school year after 12 years of being headteacher at the Basingstoke school. During her time at the school, it gained \\"Science College\\" status and was granted funding from Hampshire County Council to build new facilities. Denis McCabe (2012‚Äì2019) Denis McCabe became the headteacher of the College at the start of the 2012‚Äì13 academic year. He was formerly Deputy Headteacher at St Peter's Catholic Comprehensive School and St Katherine's secondary school. Paul Jenkins (2019-Present) Paul Jenkins was appointed as temporary headteacher after Denis McCabe left at the end of 2019, he also is the permanent headteacher of Court Moor School in Fleet. Student Leadership Aldworth Science College has a third specialism as a 'Leadership Partner School'. Students are encouraged to take leadership roles and responsibilities such as Student Council Representative, Sports Captain, Department Assistants, Prefect and Senior Prefect, Head Boy/Girl and Peer Mentoring.

Several years later, a similar 5-CD box set was released that was called the Trash Box. The Pebbles Box purports to collect the first five volumes of the Pebbles series, although there are fewer songs than on the original LPs: 72 total tracks on the five discs, as compared with 86 on the original LPs. Also, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on Pebbles, Volume 4 have been eschewed entirely. Although most of the recordings on the Pebbles Box were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series. Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit \\"I Fought the Law (but the Law Won)\\" by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) ‚Äì which is also included in the Trash Box ‚Äì in place of the much rarer \\"Wine Wine Wine\\" by Bobby Fuller that appears on Pebbles, Volume 2. The song \\"Be Forewarned\\" was actually recorded in 1972 by the early doom metal band, Pentagram. Release data The Pebbles Box was released in the United Kingdom in 1987 by Ubik Records, with a catalogue number of BOXX1. Like AIP Records ‚Äì which released the later albums in the Pebbles series ‚Äì Ubik Records is one of the record labels that was started by Bomp! Records. Differences with the Trash Box Nearly all of the tracks in the Pebbles Box are included in the Trash Box, with only two exceptions: On Disc Two of the Trash Box, the second recording by The Inmates is \\"Fakirs and Thieves\\" rather than \\"I Can Make it without You\\"; and on Disc Five, the song by the Bitter End is \\"Find Someone to Love\\" instead of \\"If You Want Somebody\\". Differences with the original Pebbles LPs While the Pebbles Box is supposed to collect the first five albums in the Pebbles series, the recordings in this box set are actually much different from the original LPs. Specifically, as to the first Pebbles album, 4 of the 8 tracks on Side 1 and 6 of the 8 tracks on Side 2 of the original LP are included on Disc One in the Pebbles Box and in the same order (plus \\"Rich with Nothin'\\" is on Disc Two). Some of the omissions are true garage rock classics, like \\"Spazz\\" and \\"I'm in Pittsburgh (and it's Raining)\\"; the other omitted songs are \\"Going All the Way\\" (which is also not included on the CD version of the original Pebbles album), the Canadian monster \\"1-2-5\\" (although there is another song by the Haunted on Disc Four), and \\"You Treat Me Bad\\". Disc One includes a different rendering of \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\" from the one that appears on the Pebbles, Volume 11 LP, along with a second Kim Fowley song, \\"Underground Lady\\" that is not otherwise available among the various Pebbles records. The other songs on Disc One ‚Äì \\"Stop & Listen\\" and \\"That Creature\\" ‚Äì are beloved garage rock recordings that appear in later volumes in the Pebbles series. The situation is similar on Pebbles, Volume 2, where just 4 songs from Side 1 and 3 songs from Side 2 are on Disc Two of this set, with \\"Green Fuz\\" moved to the other side of Disc Two and the Electric Prunes radio commercial to Disc Three. The lamented deletions include legendary bands like Zakary Thaks and the Moving Sidewalks (where Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top started out), plus the remarkable track called \\"Makin' Deals\\" by the Satans that opened that LP, which has the same general theme and even some of the same lyrics as the later Stones classic, \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\". Songs by the Litter and The Squires and both cuts by the Dovers are also left off the Pebbles Box, along with the bratty \\"So What!\\" and (as already noted) \\"Wine Wine Wine\\". However, welcome additions include \\"My Soap Won't Float\\", \\"Weird\\" and two songs by The Inmates; one of these, \\"More than I Have\\" is among the real treats on the last few Pebbles LPs, while \\"I Can Make it without You\\" is not represented elsewhere on the Pebbles albums. This is also true of \\"She's Sorry\\" and a second song by William Penn Fyve, whose \\"Swami\\" is on Pebbles, Volume 3 and Disc Five of the Pebbles Box. Disc Three includes 11 of the songs on the psychedelic grab-bag that is Pebbles, Volume 3, although the omissions include two of the standout cuts on the album, \\"I'm Five Years Ahead of My Time\\" and \\"Voices Green and Purple\\", plus several others that are not so greatly missed: \\"I'm Allergic to Flowers\\", \\"Soggy Cereal\\", \\"Dom Kellar os Mods\\", \\"Like a Dribbling Fram\\" and the bonus track. Only one of the additional songs appears elsewhere in the Pebbles series; \\"The Inner Truth\\" is on Pebbles, Volume 22, while \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Be Forewarned\\" are new to Pebbles. \\"Horror Asparagus Stories\\" by The Driving Stupid, listed on the cover and label of the original BFD LP but somehow omitted, appears in this volume. As noted, all of the tracks on Pebbles, Volume 4 have been omitted from the Pebbles Box. Although many songs appear on other Pebbles albums, none of the recordings on Disc Four appear on the first five LPs in the Pebbles series. Finally, fully half of the recordings on Pebbles, Volume 5 are not included on Disc Five of the Pebbles Box: \\"Go Away\\", \\"You Don't Know Me\\", \\"Why\\", \\"Universal Vagrant\\", \\"I Tell No Lies\\", \\"You Need Love\\", \\"The Way it Used to Be\\", \\"I Need Love\\", and \\"The Way I Feel\\". Of the tracks on Disc Five that are not on the corresponding LP, the most gratifying is \\"Shadows\\", probably the best of the three songs by Milan (also known as the Leather Boy) on the Pebbles, Volume 11 LP and the only one that has not yet been otherwise released on the Pebbles CDs. There are four additional songs on Disc Five that are new to Pebbles: a second song by Thursday's Children, \\"Time Machine\\", \\"If You Want Somebody\\", and \\"I Want More\\".

Just north of Fort Myers Shores, it travelled east along North River Road (then-State Road 78) and crossed the river on a swing bridge into Olga, where it continued to State Road 80 along what is today Olga Drive.

The attack was originally created in 1987 by Donald Davies. In 1994, Eli Biham and Alex Biryukov made significant improvements to the technique. It is a known- plaintext attack based on the non-uniform distribution of the outputs of pairs of adjacent S-boxes. It works by collecting many known plaintext/ciphertext pairs and calculating the empirical distribution of certain characteristics. Bits of the key can be deduced given sufficiently many known plaintexts, leaving the remaining bits to be found through brute force. There are tradeoffs between the number of required plaintexts, the number of key bits found, and the probability of success; the attack can find 24 bits of the key with 252 known plaintexts and 53% success rate. The Davies attack can be adapted to other Feistel ciphers besides DES. In 1998, Pornin developed techniques for analyzing and maximizing a cipher's resistance to this kind of cryptanalysis.

Civil War General William Terry Following Virginia's secession from the Union, Terry enrolled in the Confederate Army as a first lieutenant in the 4th Virginia Infantry. In April 1861, he returned to Harpers Ferry, this time as a Confederate officer serving under Stonewall Jackson. He saw his first significant combat in the First Battle of Bull Run. Terry was promoted to major in the spring of 1862 and fought in the Peninsula Campaign at the battles of Gaines' Mill and Malvern Hill. He was wounded in the Second Battle of Bull Run and was cited for gallantry in the official report of his superior, William Taliaferro. He returned to the ranks to lead the 4th Virginia Infantry at the Battle of Fredericksburg. His regiment lost 140 of its 335 men in fierce fighting at Chancellorsville, but Terry escaped injury there, as well as in fighting at Culp's Hill at Gettysburg, although the brigade suffered heavy losses.Evans, p. 674. In February 1864, he was promoted to colonel, to date from September 1863. He was commissioned as a brigadier general on May 20, 1864, following the Wilderness Campaign. The following day, he was assigned command of a brigade formed from the survivors of the Stonewall Brigade and the badly depleted brigades of John M. Jones and George H. Steuart. Terry led the consolidated unit in the fighting at Cold Harbor and the defense of Petersburg. He commanded his brigade during Jubal A. Early's 1864 campaign in the Shenandoah Valley. Terry's hard-hitting final assault at the Battle of Monocacy finally broke the Union line and forced the withdrawal of Lew Wallace's army.Army History Research Later that year, Terry was one of seven Confederate generals who were killed or wounded at the Third Battle of Winchester. Recovering, he led the brigade back to Petersburg, where he was again wounded on March 25, 1865, when Gordon's Corps attacked Fort Stedman. Terry was taken to his home in Wytheville to recover from his injuries. As a result, he missed the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House in April. When news arrived, he mounted his horse and started southward to join the army of Joseph E. Johnston in North Carolina. However, Terry returned home when news arrived of Johnston's surrender at Bennett Place. Postbellum years After the war, though partially disabled from his three Civil War wounds, Terry resumed his legal practice in Wytheville. He was nominated for Congress in 1868, but, being under political disabilities, he withdrew. Following a pardon, easily won election as a Conservative to the United States House of Representatives in 1870, serving from 1871 to 1873, but lost his campaign for reelection in 1872. Terry was re-elected to Congress in 1874 and served again from 1875 to 1877, being unsuccessful for reelection again in 1876. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1880 and afterwards resumed practicing law.Congressional biography. Death and legacy Terry drowned on September 5, 1888, while attempting to ford Reed Creek near Wytheville after returning from the Grayson County Courthouse. He was interred in the town's East End Cemetery, where his widow would join him decades later.

Verdi Square is a small triangle of land enclosed by a railing, located on Manhattan's Upper West Side, between 72nd Street and 73rd Street on the south and north, and Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue on the west and east. On the south the square fronts West 72nd Street; across the street to the south lies Sherman Square. On the north side, the park is enclosed by the Florentine Renaissance palazzo of the Central Savings Bank, now Apple Bank for Savings; that trapezoidal structure, with a vast vaulted Roman banking hall 65 feet high, was designed by York and Sawyer and built in 1926‚Äì28. The square has been designated as an official city scenic landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Monument In the center of Verdi Square stands a monument to the opera composer Giuseppe Verdi, erected in 1906.Upper West Side: Verdi Square A statue of him by Pasquale Civiletti (1858‚Äì1952) stands at the top of it and statues of four characters from his operas are on the base below him: Falstaff on the west side of the statue; Leonora of La forza del destino on the south side; Aida on the north side; and Otello on the east side. In the landscaping devised by Lynden Miller in 2004, flowers around the statue bloom in the spring and summer months.  Subway headhouse  The 72nd Street station, served by the New York City Subway's , lies under the square. The Verdi Square entrance to the station in the square is one of only three remaining head houses on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line.  History  In the 1960s and 1970s Verdi Square and Sherman Square were known by local drug users and dealers as \\"needle park\\" as depicted in The Panic in Needle Park (1971). The 72nd Street station's original control house in Verdi Square A new second entrance head house to the 72nd Street station, completed in 2002, has increased the pedestrian area to the west, taking in a former lane of Broadway traffic. The addition of the new head house has incorporated Verdi Square as part of the pedestrian complex. This, coupled with an increased NYPD presence in the new head house, has decreased the area's popularity among criminals and aided the gentrification of the neighborhood. In 2006 a group of Upper West Side music lovers in partnership with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation created the annual Verdi Square Festival of the Arts: a series of three free outdoor September Sunday afternoon concerts presenting young musicians in repertoire ranging from opera to bluegrass. The festival brings music back to a square frequented by Caruso, Chaliapin, Toscanini, the Gershwin brothers and other famous musicians.

As with all Kamov helicopters except the Ka-60/-62 family, the Ka-31 has co-axially mounted contra-rotating main rotors. The airframe of the Ka-31 is based on the Kamov Ka-27. One visually distinctive feature of the Ka-31 is the large antenna of the early-warning radar, which is either rotating or folded and stowed under the fuselage. The second is the reduction of the bulky electro- optical sensory suite beneath the cockpit. The landing gear retracts in order to prevent interference with the radar. Design and development The Kamov Joint Stock Company (then, Kamov DB), began development of the Ka-31 medium- weight naval helicopter in 1980 and the first flight took place in 1987. This development was the direct result of the cancellation of the shipborne Antonov An-71 AWACS aircraft. The An-71 was intended to be deployed on the Soviet Navy's first true aircraft carrier, Admiral Kuznetsov (then known as Tbilisi). The An-71 was cancelled in favour of the Yakovlev Yak-44. Though Yak-44 was in development (and not yet cancelled) at that time, the Soviet Navy wanted a stop-gap measure and began investigating other viable platforms to act as AEW at sea. MAKS 2007 The Soviet Navy selected the proven Kamov Ka-27 airframe. The Kamov Design Bureau was already in the process of developing the Ka-29. Nizhny Novgorod Radio Engineering Institute was working on a radar design to be used on the An-71; the same design was applied with changes for a rotary wing airframe. Integration was complete by 1980 and the helicopter was given the designation Ka-29RLD. The radar development took time and it was not until 1987 the first flight took place. The production version of the Ka-29RLD/-31 was very different from the Ka-29 from which it was derived. Some of the distinct features of the Kamov Ka-31 are:http://www.airforce- technology.com/projects/ka31/ * The removal of the bulky electro-optical sensor suite, beneath the cockpit. * The cockpit is wider than the KA-27/29, with 2 additional MFDs. * The ASW capability is not installed. * The addition of Kronstadt Kabris 12-channel global positioning system. * The powerplant is a more powerful Klimov TV3-117VMAR x 2. (the Ka-27 uses TV3-117BK) * The TA-8Ka APU is added to provide power for the radar and C4ISR * 16-channel digital communication gear with range up to . The radar of the Ka-31 airborne early warning helicopter has a 360¬∞ coverage and can spot aircraft-size target from 150 km range. Surface ships are spotted from 100‚Äì200 km range. Radar can track 30‚Äì40 targets simultaneously. The helicopter has a datalink to transfer target tracking data to the command post (land base or mother ship). The Ka-31 is fitted with GPS and digital terrain mapping systems.http://www.military- today.com/helicopters/kamov_ka31.htm Kamov Ka-31 Helix data military-today Modification Some of the engineering changes from Ka-29 are the change in powerplant, the addition of the APUs and most importantly the secondary hydraulic system. The radar is the E-801M OKO (\\"EYE\\") planar array radar designed by the Nizhny Novgorod Radio Engineering Institute. The operational variants delivered also had a Flight Information Recorder designed by the St.Petersburg/Leningrad Electrotechnical Institute, fitted in the tailcone. By the time the Yak-44 was canceled, additional responsibility of Command & control fell into the KA-29RLD/Ka-31's hands. Operational history The development and trials began in 1987 in earnest, but they were plagued by the political turmoil and the defense budget cuts in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. Finally, the aircraft entered service in very limited numbers with the Russian Navy in 1995 with its and s. The Indian Navy ordered four Ka-31 radars in 1999, and a further five in 2001. Full-scale volume production of the helicopter started in 2002. The first batch of four entered service with the Indian Navy in April 2003. The second batch were delivered in 2005. During the period when with the retirement of an old carrier, the Indian Navy was operating a single carrier, it not only operated the helicopters from aircraft carriers and destroyers, but also from its shore-based naval air stations. The operation with the Indian Navy revealed a major drawback of the aircraft, its limited endurance/range, the chief element of a taskforce/battlegroup. In response, HAL was commissioned to experiment and possibly adapt a helicopter- to-helicopter refuelling system. Also, in the Indian service, the aircraft received Abris GPS system featuring a 12-channel receiver and option to employ Differential GPS references, designed by the Kronstad itself. The later batches featured navigational equipment for digital terrain maps, ground- proximity warning, obstacle approach warning, auto-navigation of pre- programmed routes, flight stabilization and auto homing onto and landing at the parent carrier/base and information concerning the helicopter's tactical situation. In February 2013, official Chinese naval publications revealed that the PLA had decided to adopt the Ka-31 helicopter. It has since been reported that Chinese Ka-31s are based at naval bases in eastern China. Training is being conducted to ensure these helicopters will be able to provide service when the first Chinese aircraft carrier enters service.

Early career Following his breakout year with the Washington Senators in 1897, McJames was sold to the Baltimore Orioles where he achieved stardom with a 27‚Äì15 record, pitched 40 complete games in 42 starts, and had an earned run average of 2.36 in the 1898 season. McJames was second in the league with 178 strikeouts, fourth in ERA, and fourth in complete games. This 1898 Orioles squad has long been considered one of the best teams ever, with McJames as the team's star pitcher. This team included such baseball legends as John McGraw, Willie Keeler, Hughie Jennings, and Wild Bill Donovan. The following season the owners of the Baltimore Orioles purchased a half interest in the Brooklyn Bridegrooms (dubbed the \\"Superbas\\" by the media) and took their best players with them. This included James, Jennings, Keeler, Jay Hughes, and Joe Kelley. During the final game of 1899, his first season with the Superbas, James came within one out of throwing a no-hitter in his 4‚Äì0 victory over the Boston Beaneaters. The no-hitter was spoiled by future Hall of Famer Hugh Duffy with a ninth-inning single. Personal McJames was the great-grandson of Judge William Dobein James, who, at age 16 served in the Williamsburgh Militia under General Francis Marion, during the American Revolution. William James later wrote a Life of Marion, which is much used today as a reference because of its first-hand information. Doc McJames was also the great-great grandson of Major John James, chief officer under Francis \\"Swamp Fox\\" Marion of Revolutionary War fame. James went by his formal name of James McJames during his first season, then changed to \\"Doc\\" for the remainder of his career. It is speculated that he did so to hide knowledge of his baseball career from his parents, as playing baseball was not reputable at the time. He had a clause in each of his major league contracts preventing teams from playing him on Sundays. Before playing professional baseball, McJames attended the University of South Carolina. He was the first Gamecocks baseball player to make it to the major leagues. While at South Carolina, McJames played guard on the school's inaugural football team, in 1892. McJames practiced medicine in Cheraw, South Carolina. Cheraw was an active baseball town in this period and produced several other notable baseball players. James is buried in Old St. David's Cemetery in Cheraw, South Carolina. McJames was born in Williamsburg County, South Carolina. At the peak of his career, he attended medical school at the Charleston Medical College (now Medical University of South Carolina) in the off-season, graduating after three years in 1900. Death McJames later left baseball to briefly practice medicine with his father and brother in South Carolina. While making a house call, McJames was thrown from a horse- drawn carriage and within a month died from complications. He was 27 years old.

Daily Life in Louisiana 1815-1830 (Baton Rouge and London: Louisiana State University Press), 1978 (translation 1981) planter, politician, duelist, writer, horse breeder, land developer, and President of the Louisiana State Senate between 1822 and 1823. Early life The son of Pierre Enguerrand Philippe de Marigny de Mandeville (1751-1800) Ecuyer and Chevalier de St. Louis and his wife Jeanne Marie d'Estrehan de Beaupr√©, Bernard was born in New Orleans in 1785, the third generation of his family to be born in colonial Louisiana. His paternal grandfather, Antoine Philippe de Marigny, was a French nobleman, military officer, and geographer. His maternal grandfather, Jean Baptiste d'Estrehan, was the royal treasurer of the colony. In 1798, Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans (who became King Louis Philippe in 1830) and his two brothers, the Duke de Montpensier and the Count of Beaujolais, visited the Marigny plantation. By all accounts, they were lavishly entertained by the family. One story recounts that special gold dinner ware was made for the occasion of the Duke of Orleans' visit and was thrown into the river afterward, because no one would be worthy of using it again. The visit of the French royal family apparently had a big impact on Marigny, as it is reported as an example of the spoiled life in which he was reared. When he was 15 years old, his father died and Bernard inherited his father's plantation just outside the city gates, east of New Orleans' Vieux Carr√©. According to historians, \\"His every whim [was] indulged while his father was alive, he became as wild and headstrong after his death as an unbacked [wild] mustang, and his guardian, abandoning all idea of control, finally shipped him to England, hoping that life abroad might mend his manners; but in London Bernard's dissipations became only more pyrotechnic, and he spent most of his time at Almack's and other famous gambling places.\\"Tinker, Edward Larocque, The Palingenesis of Craps (1933), pp. 1-3 Craps One of the things Marigny brought back to New Orleans from England was the dice game HazardBridges, Tyler, Bad Bet in the Bayou Farrar, Straus & Giroux (2001) which became popular in a simplified form, known in local dialect as \\"Crapaud.\\" Fair Grounds Race Course Marigny founded the \\"Louisiana Race Course,\\" now the Fair Grounds Race Course, with Julius C Branch and Henry Augustine Tayloe (son of John Tayloe III of the Octagon House, a leading turfman, founder of the Washington Jockey Club (1798), who imported the great English thoroughbred Diomed who sired Sir Archy-whose progeny include Lexington, Secretariat and American Pharoah; grandson of John Tayloe II who imported Childers (by Flying Childers), Jenny Cameron and Jolly Rogers (three of the most important colonial imports) and who built the grand colonial estate and stud farm Mount Airy) and organized the first races in Spring 1838, they lasted for five days.

(The Louisiana Purchase had taken place in 1803.) Marigny had many gambling debts; and the smaller the land parcels were, the more there were to sell. The area grew rapidly and lots were sold all the way into the 1820s. Greater New Orleans Community Data Center Marigny's development was immediately popular. He spent most of 1806 and 1807 at the office of notary Narcisse Broutin selling sixty-foot lots or emplacements to prospective home builders.French Quarter history Marigny famously named the streets of his neighborhood whimsically: Abundance, Peace, History, Poets, Piety, Frenchmen, Greatmen, Goodchildren, Music, Desire, Hope, Love, Pleasure, Duels, and Craps (after the game of chance he introduced to America). \\"Though said to be poorly educated in the classics, he christened the main thoroughfare to his house Elysian Fields after Virgil's \\"Deathless Residence of the Spirits of the Blessed.\\"Scully, Helen, Mobile Press-Register August 27, 2006 Others say that Elysian Fields Avenue was named simply as the English translation for the Parisian Avenue des Champs-√âlys√©es. As more English- speaking Americans arrived in New Orleans, tensions between them and the settled Creoles began to grow. When two American developers approached Marigny about future commercial development of the city in the area of the Faubourg Marigny, the Creole first agreed, and then reneged by instructing Madame Marigny to stay away from the notary office, thus effectively killing the deal; this was reportedly due to his notorious dislike of the American settlers who were considered uncouth parvenus. This act was seen as extremely bad faith on the part of Marigny, and not only ensured that housing development grew uptown instead of east of the city, but also affected both his finances and his political career: \\"Marigny was severely blamed by the rest of the Creole population for thus yielding to his anti-American prejudices. This feeling ultimately worked his political destruction. Thereafter he was not looked on as a safe leader, and when he became a candidate for the governorship, they refused to support him.\\"Kendall, John, History of New Orleans, The Lewis Publishing Company,(1922) pp. 125-126 Strapped for cash, Marigny later sold his lots not only to white Creoles but also to free black Creoles, known as gens de couleur libre. Marigny was also related to one of the most prominent femme de couleur libre (free women of color), his half-sister Eulalie Mandeville Macarty, who was the illegitimate, but well loved daughter of Pierre Enguerrand Philippe De Marigny de Mandeville and Marie Jeanne, who was an enslaved woman from the Marigny household. Eulalie was given her freedom and brought up by her paternal grandparents, who left her well provided. Bernard de Marigny, as well as other Mandeville de Marigny family members, even testified on Eulalie de Mandeville's behalf following her husband's death, when her in-laws sued Eulalie de Mandeville for her estate. They claimed that legally a femme de couleur libre, such as herself, could not inherit the amount of money she possessed from her late- husband (or life partner, as interracial marriage was illegal). Eulalie countered by arguing that all the money she possessed she and her husband earned as equals and that the majority of their wealth came from her business endeavour from before their marriage. Bernard de Marigny testified in favour of his half-sister and helped her hold on to her wealth, not once but twice, as her late husband's family sued Eulalie de Mandeville again after being dissatisfied with the results of the first trial.Wilson, Carol. \\"Pla√ßage and the Performance of Whiteness: The Trial of Eulalie Mandeville, Free Colored Woman, of Antebellum New Orleans.\\" American Nineteenth Century History 15, no. 2 (May 4, 2014): 187‚Äì209. https://doi.org/10.1080/14664658.2014.959818.\\" Battle of New Orleans Marigny and Edward Livingston were unable to convince General Andrew Jackson to meet and seek the support of Jean Lafitte to aid in the Battle of New Orleans, whom the British forces had tried to recruit but who, according to Marigny, was more inclined to support the Americans. Lafitte did eventually meet and persuade Jackson of the Baratarian's support, which proved very useful during the campaign, meriting personal and public praise from Jackson.

Creole Families of New Orleans, by Grace King; THE MACMILLAN COMPANY; New York; 1921, pp. 23 - 59. Political career In 1811, and again in 1814, Marigny was elected to the New Orleans City Council to represent the Fifth Ward.Kendall, p. 92-93 From 1822 to 1823, Marigny served as President of the Louisiana State Senate; and, as there was no Lieutenant Governor, he was next in line of succession to Governor Thomas B. Robertson. Marigny was aide- de-camp of the prefect Pierre Cl√©ment de Laussat, then of Louisiana governor, William C. C. Claiborne, during the battle of New Orleans ‚Äî whose daughter, Sophronie Louise, later wed Marigny's son, Antoine James de Marigny. He was chairman of the state Senate from Louisiana, 1822 to 1823.King, G. Creole Families of New Orleans, by Grace King; THE MACMILLAN COMPANY; New York; 1921, pp. 23 - 59. In 1824, Marigny ran for Governor of Louisiana, but was defeated by Anglo candidate Henry Johnson. He ran again in the gubernatorial election of 1828, but he was defeated by Pierre Derbigny, whom he had supported in the 1820 election. Marigny was at one point a candidate in the special gubernatorial election of 1830, but ultimately he was not on the ballot. North shore activities Marigny's land holdings included a sugarcane plantation on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain. This region is Saint Tammany Parish, one of the Florida Parishes, lands acquired by the U.S. in 1810, prior to Louisiana's transition to statehood. Today there are a few ruins of Marigny's 1829 sugar mill; the area comprises Fontainebleau State Park. Fontainebleau was the name Marigny chose for his property, after the Fontainebleau Forest near Paris. In 1834, Marigny de Mandeville laid out the town which bears his family name, Mandeville, Louisiana. Later life and death Marigny eventually lost his fortune gambling and died impoverished, in 1868. He was buried at Saint Louis Cemetery No. 1 in New Orleans.

It is the promotion's principal championship. Like most professional wrestling championships, the title is won via the result of a predetermined match. Before the championship was created, the promotion, then known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), controlled the NWA World Heavyweight Championship via an agreement with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). In 2007, the agreement between TNA and the NWA ended, leading to the creation of the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. The championship was unveiled on May 14, 2007 at the taping of TNA's primary television program, Impact!, which aired on May 17, 2007. The inaugural champion was Kurt Angle, who also holds the record for the most reigns at six. When TNA changed its name and became Impact Wrestling in March 2017, the title was renamed soon after to reflect the change. After Impact Wrestling rebranded to GFW later that year, the title was unified with the original GFW Global Championship at Slammiversary XV and became the Unified GFW World Heavyweight Championship. Following Destination X, the title took the GFW Global Championship name and kept the former TNA lineage. On October 23, 2017, the GFW name was dropped and the company name was reverted to Impact Wrestling when the company severed ties with Jeff Jarrett and he took the GFW name with him. However, Impact Wrestling kept the Global Championship name for their championship and the title was then called the Impact Global Championship. As of the February 1, 2018 episode of Impact!, the title has been known as the Impact World Championship. On June 4, 2018, the title was unified with the Impact Grand Championship.  History  Impact Wrestling was formed as NWA: Total Nonstop Action in May 2002. Later that same year, TNA was granted control over the NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships by the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) governing body; subsequently becoming an official NWA territory as NWA-TNA. On June 19, 2002, NWA-TNA held its first show; a weekly pay-per-view event. The main event of the telecast was a twenty-man Gauntlet for the Gold match in which 20 men sought to throw each other over the top rope and down to the floor in order to eliminate others, until there were two men left who wrestle a standard singles match to become the first ever TNA-era NWA World Heavyweight Champion. Ken Shamrock defeated Malice to win the vacant championship with Ricky Steamboat as the special guest referee at the event.  Creation  The NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships were contested for in TNA until the morning of May 13, 2007. On that day, NWA's Executive Director Robert Trobich announced that the NWA were ending their five-year agreement with TNA, which had allowed them full control over both titles. Trobich went on to state that effective that morning, then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Christian Cage and then-NWA World Tag Team Champions Team 3D were stripped of their respective championships. The alleged motivation behind these actions was because Cage refused to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against wrestlers from NWA territories. That same day, TNA were scheduled to produce their Sacrifice event, in which both Cage and Team 3D were to defend their respective championships. On the card, Cage was scheduled to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Kurt Angle and Sting in a match involving three competitors, also known as a three-way match. That night, the onscreen graphic used to refer to the champions and their respective championships credited both Cage and Team 3D as still being NWA champions. However, the ring announcers for the encounters proclaimed the matches as being strictly for the \\"World Heavyweight Championship\\" and the \\"World Tag Team Championship\\". Angle defeated Cage and Sting to win the World Heavyweight Championship. TNA held a set of tapings for the next two episodes of Impact! on May 14, with the episodes set to air on tape delay on May 17 and May 24. At the first taping, Angle came to the ring with the new TNA World Heavyweight Championship belt and announced that he was the \\"new TNA World Heavyweight Champion\\". TNA commentator Mike Tenay announced when Angle made his way to the ring that Management Director Jim Cornette, TNA's on-screen authority figure at the time, \\"made the decision that due to TNA's growing worldwide exposure, the company needed to have its own TNA title belts\\"; thereby not acknowledging the NWA ending their agreement with TNA and giving a storyline explanation as to why the championship was created. Later on during the broadcast, Cornette stripped Angle of the TNA World Heavyweight Championship due to a controversial finish to the match at Sacrifice. Cornette then announced the championship would be contested for at TNA's Slammiversary on June 17, 2007 in a King of the Mountain match‚Äîa match which involves five participants racing to gain a pinfall or submission to become eligible to hang a championship belt to win. On May 15, 2007, Jeremy Borash unveiled the TNA World Heavyweight Championship belt on that day's edition of TNA's online podcast TNA Today. Kurt Angle was the first TNA World Heavyweight Champion, seen here hoisting the first title belt design (left) The five participants for the King of the Mountain match were determined in a series of standard wrestling matches that took place on Impact! leading up to the event, with Angle defeating Rhino in the first bout to gain entry on the May 17 episode of Impact!. On the May 24 episode of Impact!, Samoa Joe defeated Sting to become the second participant. The third qualification match was held on the May 31 episode of Impact! between A.J. Styles and Tomko, which Styles won. The next bout pitted Chris Harris against James Storm on the June 7 episode Impact!, which ended in a double disqualification, therefore neither man advanced to the King of the Mountain match. The final qualification match was won by Christian Cage over Abyss on the June 14 episode of Impact!. Angle ended up winning the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary over Joe, Cage, Styles and Harris, who was a mystery participant chosen by Cornette, to become the \\"undisputed TNA World Heavyweight Champion\\". In early 2017 After TNA rebranded as Impact Wrestling, the name of its flagship show, the TNA World Heavyweight Championship changed its name to the Impact Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship to reflect the name changes of the company. At Slammiversary XV, GFW Global Champion Alberto El Patron defeated Impact Wrestling World Heavyweight Champion Bobby Lashley to unify the titles, with the GFW Global Championship being dropped and the Impact World Heavyweight Championship changing its name to the Unified GFW World Championship as Impact Wrestling began rebranding once again as GFW. In September 2017, GFW reverted their branding to Impact Wrestling.  Championship belt design  Jeff Hardy with his custom design, dubbed the \\"Immortal Championship\\" During the championship's history it has had five designs, with the original title belt (which was unveiled in May 2007) having on its center plate an imprint of an eagle with its wings extended. The word \\"World\\" was placed above the eagle's head on a ribbon. The ribbon was wrapped around the bird's wings and body. Five stars were engraved on the ribbon when it passed over each of the bird's wings and the word \\"Champion\\" as it passed over the bird's talons. The words \\"Heavyweight Wrestling\\" were printed across the bird's chest. At the top of the center plate there was TNA logo. Four smaller side plates had an imprint of a globe centered with TNA's logo at the top and bottom of each. At each end of the title belt there was a small plate that covered the championship belt snaps with TNA's logo engraved on each. At the November 8, 2010 tapings of the November 11 episode of Impact!, TNA introduced a new design for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship belt, which the champion Jeff Hardy dubbed the \\"Immortal Championship\\", as part of the Immortal storyline. The new design consisted of a purple strap with a silver center plate depicting a masked head (designed to resemble Hardy's face with face paint), the TNA logo on the forehead and blue lines along the mask. There were four irregular dodecagonal side plates on the title belt, shaped like stars with rounded edges on two of the sides of these plates. Ethan Carter III with the third title belt design The Immortal title belt was replaced by the third design of the championship belt at the March 14, 2011 tapings of the March 17 episode of Impact!, introduced by the reigning champion at the time, Sting. The design featured seven gold plates over a black leather strap. The center plate had faux diamonds aligned along its multiple rounded edges, similar to that of the Big Gold Belt. Over the center plate was a large TNA Wrestling logo and below it the words \\"Heavyweight Champion\\" engraved in silver. On each side of the center plate was a group of three smaller plates, one with a TNA logo engraved while the other two featured separate corresponding halves of a globe, on either side of the TNA logo side plate. Following Slammiversary XV, both the TNA and original GFW Global Championship belts were used in connection to represent the unification of both titles. At Destination X 2017, the GFW Global Championship belt, with an updated color scheme and Impact logos on the side plates, became the sole belt used. Following departure of Jeff Jarrett from the promotion, the company reverted to the Impact Wrestling name and the title belt was updated with an Impact name plate to reflect the change. Eli Drake with the fourth title belt design; note the \\"Impact\\" plate added to the title belt to reflect the company reverting to the Impact Wrestling name A new title design was announced and introduced at Impact Wrestling's Redemption on April 22, 2018. The gold center plate has the Impact logo with an owl design on top of it and \\"World Champion\\" inscribed below the logo. On each side of the center plate is a group of four smaller gold plates, with the first two on each side featuring separate corresponding halves of a globe with \\"World\\" inscribed above the globes and \\"Champion\\" inscribed below them and the second pair featuring the Impact logo without an owl design. In 2020, the belt was modified, with red replacing the previous blue, to reflect the new color of the Impact Wrestling logo introduced following the move to AXS TV.  Reigns  Overall, there have been 49 reigns shared among 27 wrestlers. The inaugural champion was Kurt Angle, who won the championship by defeating Christian Cage and Sting in a three-way match on May 13, 2007, at TNA's Sacrifice event. Angle's first reign also holds the record for shortest reign in the title's history, at 1 day. Angle also holds the record for the most reigns, at six. At days, Bobby Roode's first reign is the longest in the title's history. The title has been vacated six different times. The current champion is Eric Young, who is in his second reign. He defeated Eddie Edwards on August 15, 2020 in Nashville, Tennessee during the Impact! tapings to win the title (aired on tape delay on September 1, 2020).

It was one of several communities along the historic Coal Branch segment of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (now part of the Canadian National Railway), which included Embarras, Robb, Coalspur, Coal Valley, Cadomin, Luscar, and Mountain Park. At its peak in the late 1940s and early 1950s the town had over 800 residents. Mercoal declined after the mines closed in 1959, and it is now essentially a ghost town with only a small number of summer residences remaining. It is situated on Highway 40, 70 km southwest of Edson, 8 km (5 mi) west of Coalspur. History Mercoal's name was an acronym for the McLeod River Hard Coal Company, co-owned by Nick Gurvich, who opened an underground coal mine in 1920. In 1924 the mine was sold to Saunders Ridge Coal Company, Ltd.Toni Ross, Oh! The Coal Branch (Edmonton: Friesen, 1974), p. 59 The Mercoal mine was the last major operator in the Coal Branch area, and it attracted workers from other Coal Branch towns after the closure of the mines at Mountain Park in 1950 and Cadomin in 1952. The Mercoal mine finally closed on July 17, 1959.

IRA membership McCartney took part in the civil rights march in Derry on 30 January 1972, an event widely known as Bloody Sunday. One of his cousins, James Wray, was one of 14 men shot and killed by the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment on that march. As a result of this incident McCartney joined the Provisional IRA several months later. In 1974 Martin McGuinness, who commanded the IRA in Derry, instructed McCartney to beat up an INLA man, Patsy O'Hara, who McGuinness called a \\"scumbag\\" and a \\"hood\\". On 12 January 1979 at Belfast Crown Court McCartney and another man, Eamonn MacDermott, were convicted of the murder of Detective Constable Patrick McNulty of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, who was shot several times outside a garage in Derry on 27 January 1977. McCartney was also convicted of IRA membership and the murder of businessman Jeffery Agate in February 1977, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The murder convictions were overturned in 2007. Imprisonment McCartney was involved in the blanket and dirty protests, then took part in the 1980 hunger strike, along with fellow IRA members Brendan Hughes, Tommy McKearney, Tom McFeely, Sean McKenna, Leo Green, and Irish National Liberation Army member John Nixon.

Wire gauze is placed on the support ring that is attached to the retort stand between the Bunsen burner and the glassware to support the beakers, flasks, or other glassware during heating. Wire gauze is an important piece of supporting equipment in a laboratory as glassware cannot be heated directly with the flame of a Bunsen burner, and requires the use of a wire gauze to diffuse the heat, helping to protect the glassware. Glassware has to be flat-bottomed to stay on the wire gauze. Some wire gauze has a ceramic centre. Plain wire gauze can transmit heat efficiently, but gauze with a ceramic center will also allow the heat to be dispersed more evenly. The ceramic at the centre of the wire gauze is enmeshed at high pressure to prevent it from peeling. Wire gauze may be woven from metals such as iron, steel, copper, or nichrome. Nichrome alloy provides long life expectancy and tear resistance. The edges of the wire gauze are turned inward to help prevent fraying, improve handling, and reduce the danger from sharp protruding wire ends.

Early life Born to a U.S. postal worker in Anna, Texas, he was arrested in Aspermont, Texas after police found him carrying a suitcase full of stolen goods. The 14-year-old Fults escaped from the town's jail a week later after making a key from an old tobacco can. With the town sheriff attending the county fair, Fults was able to start a mass jailbreak, letting the remaining inmates out of jail. However, Fults was soon recaptured and incarcerated in the Gatesville State School, from which he escaped on April 16, 1927. Two years later, Fults was arrested and convicted of burglary after selling stolen cigarettes to a grocer in Greenville, Texas. Given a two-year prison sentence, Fults arrived in Huntsville Prison on June 16. He was eventually transferred to Eastham prison farm, from which he escaped with two other inmates on April 8, 1930. Recaptured five months later while burgling a hardware store in St. Louis, he was sent back to Texas, where he received a parole on August 16, 1931. Fults with Hamilton, Bonnie & Clyde Nineteen year old Fults met Clyde Barrow in the back of Bud Russell's \\"one-way wagon.\\" They were being transported to Eastham Prison Farm in Huntsville Texas. Fults had previously escaped and was retaliated against by guards. The inmates were warned that anybody that associated with him would be punished but Clyde refused to stop openly associating with Fults. While incarcerated the two inmates began to plan a raid on the farm when they got out, in which they would release as many fellow inmates as possible. During his time in prison, he had become acquainted with many criminals and outlaws of the \\"public enemy era\\" and helped smuggle hacksaw blades to bank robber Ray Hamilton to escape from jail in McKinney, Texas on January 27, 1932. He later joined up with Hamilton on March 22 and, along with Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, attempted to rob a hardware store in Mabank, Texas. However, after the night watchmen sounded the alarm, the four fled in a stolen car until Barrow drove into a mud hole, which bogged the car down. Although Barrow and Hamilton were able to escape on foot, Fults and Parker were arrested by arriving police. Fults was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment on May 11, 1932 although he was later granted a pardon by Governor Miriam A. Ferguson shortly before leaving office on January 10, 1935. Reuniting with Hamilton Rejoining Hamilton less than a month later, the two stole eight Thompson submachine guns from a National Guard armory in Beaumont, Texas. After stealing a car in Tulsa, Oklahoma on February 24, he and Hamilton headed for Texas after managing to evade a police ambush while passing through McKinney. On March 19, 1935 the two gave an interview to a Houston journalist detailing inhumane treatment in the Texas penal system. That same afternoon, he and Hamilton robbed a grocery store in San Antonio. Three days later, while driving towards Mississippi, the two stopped at the Louisiana site where Bonnie and Clyde had been killed the previous year. Stealing a car in Hattiesburg, Mississippi on March 27, he and Hamilton robbed a bank at Prentiss, Mississippi the following day. After this latest robbery, the two separated, with Fults boarding a train to Louisville, Kentucky and Hamilton returning to Texas. However, after his arrival in Springfield, Illinois on April 5, Fults had learned of Hamilton's arrest at Fort Worth that same day and immediately took the first bus bound for Texas. Fults reached Fort Worth on April 8 and, although perhaps planning to save his old partner from the electric chair, he instead drove to his mother's home in McKinney. Stealing a car from Renner, Texas on April 12, 1935 he and an unidentified accomplice stole $900 from an oil refinery in Graham, Texas. Later years Captured by police in Denton County, Texas on April 17, his latest crime spree came to an end and he was returned to Huntsville prison until his extradition to Mississippi to face bank robbery charges. Convicted in September 1935, he was sentenced to fifty years' imprisonment at the Parchman prison farm. Although he was put in solitary confinement for leading a prison strike, he was pardoned in 1944 and thereafter assumed a legitimate profession as a security guard at an orphanage. He ran the huge laundry facility, at Buckner Baptist Children's Home, located at 5200 S. Buckner Blvd., in Dallas, Texas. He converted to Christianity and spoke to the children about the evils of a life of crime. In 1960 Ralph Fults helped create a local television program called Confession. On this program, in a panel format, Fults and representatives of the Texas State Board of Pardons and Paroles and of the state prison system discussed with former inmates, businesspeople, and attorneys the unique needs of former prisoners and the importance of offering them jobs. Through the efforts of Norman Vincent Peale the program was nationally syndicated. He died in Dallas on March 16, 1993 at the age of 82. References * Newton, Michael.

Early life The son of Sir George Martin and his first wife, Sheena (n√©e Chisholm), Gregory Martin attended Britain's St Albans School and trained as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, studying alongside Juliet Stevenson and Alan Rickman.\\"Biography - Gregory Paul Martin\\" , gregorypaulmartin.com; retrieved 9 December 2012. Career=Theatre Martin's acting roles in the British theater include the world premiere of Bent (1979), at The Royal Court in London with Sir Ian McKellen, a season at the Bristol Old Vic, and seasons at London's Old Vic and Young Vic theaters. His American theater credits include the title roles in Hamlet and Peer Gynt at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, as well as the American premier of Harold Pinter's Other Places, at The Manhattan Theater Club in New York City. Television Martin appeared opposite Faye Dunaway, Liam Neeson, and Richard Burton in the 1984 CBS mini-series Ellis Island. He made appearances in a number of television series of the 1980s-1990s, including Murder, She Wrote, Sliders, Babylon 5, and Mad About You. Film Martin appeared in the movie Memoirs of an Invisible Man (1992), alongside Chevy Chase and Daryl Hannah, and A Walk in the Clouds, opposite Keanu Reeves and Anthony Quinn. Writing In recent years, Martin has focused on script writing. His personal website says he sold a script for a movie called Tsunami, optioned as an ABC miniseries, and a script for a movie called Ice as a sci-fi action thriller set in Antarctica. In 1998 Martin returned for a brief period to England and started a film and television production company, according to his website. After receiving poor treatment from the British tabloid press, he left England again, determined not to return. In 2000, he published a satirical memoir, Dirty Rotten Scoundrel, which was based in part on his treatment in the tabloids. In describing this work, Martin says: : \\"I wrote this book as a satire of an ugly image foisted on me by the British tabloids during the summer of 1999, and was never intended to be taken seriously. I take it as an oddly flattering compliment people assumed the character was really me.\\"Dirty Rotten Scoundrel, amazon.com; accessed 24 May 2015. A Guardian review of the book, which apparently did take it straight rather than as satire, says his reputation in the UK was badly damaged with a failed engagement to a socialite in 1999 that became tabloid fodder. The Guardian says of his book: : \\"A diary of his years at Rada and in the film and TV business in the US (among other things, he starred in Ellis Island, and co- starred in Ellen) as well as the events of last year, it is full of 'birds' and 'horny little slappers', of 'sexy young blueblood vixens', and 'gorgeous, sweet, hot-as-a-chilli-pepper-ridden-chicken-vindaloo beauties.'\\"\\"Confessions of a Cad: Greg Martin\\", Sabine Durrant, The Guardian (UK), 26 March 2000. After returning to the US, Martin resumed script writing and also got involved in advertising and brand marketing, according to his website. Personal life and family After his move to Hollywood during the 1980s, Martin married, and he and his wife had a son, Connor. The marriage ended in divorce. He is currently married to Cherie Martin.

A North Korean farm, 2008. The Hungju Chicken Farm, 2007. A tractor in North Korea. Crops growing in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Food grown in the private gardens surrounding people's homes. Farming in North Korea is concentrated in the flatlands of the four west coast provinces, where a longer growing season, level land, adequate rainfall, and good irrigated soil permit the most intensive cultivation of crops. A narrow strip of similarly fertile land runs through the eastern seaboard Hamgy≈èng provinces and Kangw≈èn Province. The interior provinces of Chagang and Ryanggang are too mountainous, cold, and dry to allow much farming. The mountains contain the bulk of North Korea's forest reserves while the foothills within and between the major agricultural regions provide lands for livestock grazing and fruit tree cultivation. Major crops include rice and potatoes. 23.4% of North Korea's labor force worked in agriculture in 2012.  Farming conditions  North Korea's sparse agricultural resources restricts agricultural production. Climate, terrain, and soil conditions are not particularly favorable for farming, with a relatively short cropping season. Only about 17% of the total landmass, or approximately , is arable, of which is well suited for cereal cultivation; the major portion of the country is rugged mountain terrain. The weather varies markedly according to elevation, and lack of precipitation, along with infertile soil, makes land at elevations higher than 400 meters unsuitable for purposes other than grazing. Precipitation is geographically and seasonally irregular, and in most parts of the country as much as half the annual rainfall occurs in the three summer months. This pattern favors the cultivation of paddy rice in warmer regions that are outfitted with irrigation and flood control networks. Rice yields are 5.3 tonnes per hectare, close to international norms.  Agricultural products = Rice  Rice is North Korea's primary farm product.  Potatoes  Potatoes have become an important food source in North Korea. After the 1990s famine, a \\"potato revolution\\" has taken place. Between 1998 and 2008 the area of potato cultivation in North Korea quadrupled to 200,000 ha and per capita consumption increased from per year. The potato was considered a second grade food item, but has become the main staple in rural areas, replacing rice. Greenhouse products Since 2014 many greenhouses have been built, funded by the new semi-private traders in co-operation with farmers, growing soft fruits such as strawberries and melons. The traders arrange distribution and sale in the Jangmadang markets in cities. Food distribution system Since the 1950s, a majority of North Koreans have received their food through the Public Distribution System (PDS). The PDS requires farmers in agricultural regions to hand over a portion of their production to the government and then reallocates the surplus to urban regions, which cannot grow their own foods. About 70% of the North Korean population, including the entire urban population, receives food through this government-run system. Before the floods, recipients were generally allotted 600‚Äì700 grams per day while high officials, military men, heavy laborers, and public security personnel were allotted slightly larger portions of 700‚Äì800 grams per day. As of 2013, the target average distribution was 573 grams of cereal equivalent per person per day, but varied according to age, occupation, and whether rations are received elsewhere (such as school meals). Decreases in production affected the quantity of food available through the public distribution system. Shortages were compounded when the North Korean government imposed further restrictions on collective farmers. When farmers, who had never been covered by the PDS, were mandated by the government to reduce their own food allotments from 167 kilograms to 107 kilograms of grain per person each year, they responded by withholding portions of the required amount of grain. Famine refugees reported that the government decreased PDS rations to 150 grams in 1994 and to as low as 30 grams by 1997. The PDS failed to provide any food from April to August 1998 (the ‚Äúlean‚Äù season) as well as from March to June 1999. In January 1998, the North Korean government publicly announced that the PDS would no longer distribute rations and that families needed to somehow procure their own food supplies. By 2005 the PDS was only supplying households with approximately one half of an absolute minimum caloric need. By 2008 the system had significantly recovered, and from 2009 to 2013 daily per person rations averaged at 400 grams per day for much of the year, though in 2011 it dropped to 200 grams per day from May to September. It is estimated that in the early 2000s, the average North Korean family drew some 80% of its income from small businesses that were technically illegal (though unenforced) in North Korea. In 2002, and in 2010, private markets were progressively legalized. As of 2013, urban and farmer markets were held every 10 days, and most urban residents lived within 2 km of a market, with markets having an increasing role in obtaining food.  Agricultural policy  Since self-sufficiency remains an important pillar of North Korean ideology, self-sufficiency in food production is deemed a worthy goal. Another aim of government policies‚Äîto reduce the \\"gap\\" between urban and rural living standards‚Äîrequires continued investment in the agricultural sector. Finally, as in most countries, changes in the supply or prices of foodstuffs probably are the most conspicuous and sensitive economic concerns for the average citizen. The stability of the country depends on steady, if not rapid, increases in the availability of food items at reasonable prices. In the early 1990s, there were severe food shortages.United Nations Development Program, Millennium Development Goals and the DPRK, retrieved 21 October 21, 2011, The most far-reaching statement on agricultural policy is embodied in Kim Il-sung's 1964 Theses on the Socialist Agrarian Question in Our Country, which underscores the government's concern for agricultural development. Kim emphasized technological and educational progress in the countryside as well as collective forms of ownership and management.  Agricultural history  Agriculture in North Korea relies heavily on manual labor with few machines in sight. During harvest season, students are often drafted in from cities to help bring in the crops in time before the autumn rains. As industrialization progressed, the share of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries in the total national output declined from 63.5% and 31.4%, respectively, in 1945 and 1946, to a low of 26.8% in 1990. Their share in the labor force also declined from 57.6% in 1960 to 34.4% in 1989. In the 1990s decreasing ability to carry out mechanized operations (including the pumping of water for irrigation), as well as lack of chemical inputs, was clearly contributing to reduced yields and increased harvesting and post-harvest losses. Incremental improvements in agricultural production have been made since the late 1990s, bringing North Korea close to self-sufficiency in staple foods by 2013. In particular rice yields have steadily improved, though yields on other crops have generally not improved. The production of protein foods remains inadequate. Access to chemical fertilizer has declined, but the use of compost and other organic fertilizer has been encouraged. Crisis and famine (1994‚Äì1998) From 1994 to 1998 North Korea suffered a famine. Since 1998 there has been a gradual recovery in agriculture production, which by 2013 brought North Korea back close to self-sufficiency in staple foods. However, as of 2013, most households have borderline or poor food consumption, and consumption of protein remains inadequate. In the 1990s the North Korean economy saw stagnation turning into crisis. Economic assistance received from the USSR and China was an important factor of its economic growth. In 1991 USSR collapsed, withdrew its support and demanded payment in hard currency for imports. China stepped in to provide some assistance and supplied food and oil, most of it reportedly at concessionary prices. But in 1994 China reduced its exports to North Korea. The rigidity in the political and economic systems of North Korea left the country ill-prepared for a changing world. The North Korean economy was undermined and its industrial output began to decline in 1990. Deprived of industrial inputs, including fertilizers, pesticides, and electricity for irrigation, agricultural output also started to decrease even before North Korea had a series of natural disasters in the mid-1990s. This evolution, combined with a series of natural disasters including record floods in 1995, caused one of the worst economic crises in North Korea's history. Other causes of this crisis were high defense spending (about 25% of GDP) and bad governance. It is estimated that between 1992 and 1998 North Korea's economy contracted by 50% and several hundred thousand (possibly up to 3 million) people died of starvation. North Korea announced in December 1993 a 3-year transitional economic policy placing primary emphasis on agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade. A lack of fertilizer, natural disasters, and poor storage and transportation practices have left the country more than a million tons per year short of grain self-sufficiency. Moreover, lack of foreign exchange to purchase spare parts and oil for electricity generation left many factories idle. The 1990s famine paralyzed many of the Stalinist economic institutions. The government pursued Kim Jong Il's Songun policy, under which the military is deployed to direct production and infrastructure projects. As a consequence of the government's policy of establishing economic self-sufficiency, the North Korean economy has become increasingly isolated from that of the rest of the world, and its industrial development and structure do not reflect its international competitiveness. Food shortages Houses in South Hamgyong Province damaged by floods in July 2012 The food shortage was caused as a direct result of the massive flooding and a mix of political failure and poor amounts of arable land in the country. In 2004, more than half (57%) of the population didn't have enough food to stay healthy. 37% of the children had their growth stunted and 1/3 of mothers were severely undernourished. In 2006, the World Food Program (WFP) and FAO estimated a requirement of 5.3 to 6.5 million tons of grain when domestic production fulfilled only 3.8 million tons. The country also faces land degradation after forests stripped for agriculture resulted in soil erosion. Harsh weather conditions that dented the agricultural output (wheat and barley production dropped 50% and 80% respectively in 2011) and rising global food prices stressed greater food shortage, putting 6 million North Koreans at risk. With a dramatic increase on the reliance on private sales of goods, as well as increased international aid, the situation has improved somewhat with undernourishment no longer being a major concern for most North Koreans as of 2014, although PDS (the Public Distribution System) still continues. The yield in food production in 2016 increased by 7 percent from 4.5 million tonnes in 2015 to 4.8 million tonnes and North has produced more food than South. It is estimated production decreased by 2 percent in 2017 to 4.7 million tonnes. Food production further fell in 2018 thus 641 thousand tons is needed to be imported and in comparison to last year when required 456 thousand tons with 390 thousand bought by and 66 thousand received by North Korea.

The film depicts a trial taking place in Bamako, the capital of Mali, amid the daily life that is going on in the city. In the midst of that trial, two sides argue whether the World Bank and International Monetary Fund are guided by special interest of developed nations, or whether it is corruption and the individual nations' mismanagement, that is guilty of the current financial state of many poverty-stricken African countries as well as the rest of the poor undeveloped world. The film even touches on European colonization and discusses how it plays a role in shaping African societies and their resulting poverty and issues. Danny Glover, one of the film's executive producers, also guest-stars as an actor in a Western film (called Death in Timbuktu) that some children are watching on the television in one scene.  Accolades  Actress A√Øssa Ma√Øga was nominated for the C√©sar Award for Most Promising Actress in 2007. Bamako was the recipient of the first Film Award of the Council of Europe (FACE) given at the Istanbul International Film Festival in April 2007. Bamako won the award for Best French-Language Film/Meilleur Film Francophone at the Prix Lumi√®re Bamako was also the winner of the Audience Award at the Paris Cinema in 2006. Salon critic Andrew O'Hehir selected the film when asked to present one film within the Maryland Film Festival in 2008.  Reception  The film was received a Metacritic score of 81 out of 100 which meant the film was met with critical acclaim. The film has a score of 85% with a certified \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 54 reviews with the consensus being it is \\"A courtroom drama and a portrait of everyday Mali life, Bamako approaches both subjects with equal skill and success.\\" The film received much praise for its direction by Sissako. Entertainment Weekly gave Bamako an A, calling it \\"a passionate, challenging drama from the fine Mauritanian writer-director Abderrahmane Sissako\\" and that it brings \\"moments of brimming, illogical, intimate neighborly dailiness the filmmaker also captures with warmth and infectious high spirits\\". A. O. Scott from The New York Times said that \\"he has never seen a film quite like Bamako and praising the director's vision as a \\"seething, complicated and a disarmingly beautiful investigation of Africa's social, economic and human crises\\" and going on to describe the film as \\"something different, a work of cool intelligence and profound anger, a long, dense, argument that is also a haunting visual poem\\". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune in his review gave the film 3 1/2 stars out of 4 and said \\"Sissako has an unusual camera eye, patient and alert to the ebb and flow of both the courtroom sequences and the outside scenes. The music is wonderful as well.\\" Wesley Morris from the Boston Globe in an overwhelmingly positive review said \\"As demonstrated in his previous film, a plangent snapshot of subsistence called \\"Waiting for Happiness,\\" Sissako is a poet, and the filmmaking in this new picture is stuff of a deserving laureate.\\" The Empire review gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and said that the film is \\"Far from an easy watch, either in terms of its hard- hitting content, seemingly haphazard structuring or its dense symbolism. But this makes sense of the political intricacies by balancing the rhetoric and statistics with everyday occurrences that give the iniquities and inadequacies a human face.\\" The review in The Washington Post said \\"No one can deny the powerful reality that weaves its way through Bamako.\\" See also * Life and Debt * Black Gold * Confessions of an Economic Hit Man ReferencesExternal links  Danny Glover talks about Bamako * Bamako Film Summary and Critique at DVD Outsider 2006 films Bambara- language films 2006 drama films French films French-language films Malian films Films directed by Abderrahmane Sissako Films set in Mali Best French- Language Film Lumi√®res Award winners ","title":"Bamako (film)"},{"id":"9636278","text":"Frank Barnard may refer to: * Francis Jones Barnard (1829‚Äì1889), Canadian businessman and Member of Parliament * Francis Stillman Barnard (1856‚Äì1936), Canadian parliamentarian and Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia * Frank Barnard (author) (born 1938), British novelist and journalist ","title":"Frank Barnard"},{"id":"9636313","text":"Richard Sedlon (1900‚Äì1992) was an American painter from Bedford, Ohio.

It was formed in 1943 as a Fleet Requirements Unit, being disbanded in December 1944. It was reformed twice in the 1940s and 1950s to provide flying experience for naval officers. The current squadron was created on 6 Dec 2001 from the Royal Naval Flying Training Flight. It operates the Grob Tutor, with its primary role to provide grading and legacy-Elementary Flying Training for Royal Navy and Royal Marine pilots under training. It also supports the Royal Navy's \\"Flying Start\\" flying scholarship scheme. History of 727 NAS=Fleet Requirements Unit (1943 - 1944) 727 Naval Air Squadron was formed on 26 May 1943 at Gibraltar as a Fleet Requirements Unit covering the area from Bizerta to Algiers. The squadron was equipped with target-towing Boulton Paul Defiants, Fairey Swordfish and Hawker Hurricane IIc. The squadron was disbanded on 7 December 1944. Air Experience Unit (1946 - 1960) After World War II it was decided to provide air acquaint courses for junior Royal Navy and Royal Marines officers who were not aviation specialists. 727 NAS was reformed on 23 April 1946 at RNAS Lee-on-Solent with gliders, Tiger Moths, Supermarine Seafires, North American Harvards and a Fairey Firefly. Disbanded on 17 January 1950, the squadron was reformed on 4 January 1956 as the Dartmouth Cadet Air Training Squadron. Now operating from RNAS Brawdy, Pembrokeshire, the squadron flew Boulton Paul Sea Balliols, De Havilland Sea Vampire T22s and a Percival Sea Prince T.1. Two Westland Dragonfly helicopters were provided in September 1958, but the squadron was disbanded on 16 December 1960. History of the Royal Naval Flying Training Flight Royal Navy Chipmunk of the Britannia Flight at Plymouth in 1969Since 1949 the Britannia Royal Naval College at Dartmouth has operated light aircraft for recreational flying, as well as running summer flying camps. Types flown have included De Havilland Tiger Moths, Auster and De Havilland Chipmunk. Miles Messenger and Miles Gemini aircraft were also introduced. After grading of potential aircrew was introduced, these aircraft were employed during the week for assessing future aircrew and at weekends for recreation. By this time the aircraft were based at Roborough Airport, on the outskirts of Plymouth. By 1966 the flight had been stabilised at 12 Chipmunk aircraft. Commissioning the RNFTF as 727 NAS (2001 - present) On 6 December 2001 the Royal Naval Flying Training Flight was commissioned as 727 Naval Air Squadron, at Plymouth City Airport, initially with the de Havilland Chipmunk and later with the Grob Tutor, and in January 2007 the squadron relocated to RNAS Yeovilton. The commissioning ceremony was attended by an original pilot member of 727, Geoffrey Harrington, who served with 727 in North Africa during WW2. Current role Grob Tutor (G115E) aircraftThe squadron currently operates five Grob Tutor trainer aircraft under a private finance initiative with Babcock International's aerospace division. This, along with five Qualified Flying Instructors (QFIs), allow up to ten students to be accommodated with the squadron at any time. Grading Pre-selected prospective pilots are assessed for their suitability to continue flight training. During Flying Grading, they will fly a twelve hour syllabus with an instructor before flying a pre-FHT with a different instructor and then a Final Handling Test (FHT) with the Squadron Commanding Officer. The aim of the FHT is to fly the aircraft unassisted whilst being assessed on complete Departure, Climb, Level Off, Turns, Stall, Spin, Aerobatics, Recovery and 3 Circuits. If the student performs well with only limited prompting in the FHT then he will pass; The FHT is designed to assess the pilots rate of progress and temperament to ensure it matches the fast pace of further training. Successful pilots continue their flying training with 703 Naval Air Squadron at RAF Barkston Heath, whilst those unsuccessful are rebranched for other duties within the Royal Navy and have the choice to resign from training. Special Flying Award The squadron also undertakes many other roles, one of which is the Special Flying Award. This scheme is open to any member of the public who has expressed an interest in joining the Fleet Air Arm as aircrew and have been put forward by their Careers Office. The course lasts for two weeks with the aim of 10 hours in the cockpit. There are also a number of Special Flying Awards organised for members of the URNU and the CCF. Elementary Flying Training 727 also accommodates students who undertake Elementary Flying Training on the Tutor, which sees them complete a course similar to the legacy EFT, still being undertaken by 16 Squadron at RAF Wittering. The Squadron Today The squadron currently has just two full-time Naval personnel; the commanding officer and the training officer. Babcock employs five civilian flying instructors under their contract to teach the students. The squadron is also supported by a number of ex-service QFIs from the RNR to instruct and two holdover student pilots who are between flying training courses bound for general duties. Maintenance of the Grob fleet is provided by a Babcock senior licensed engineer with three engineering support staff. An aircraft handler provides aircraft handling, refuelling and assistance to aircrew. The squadron moved from Plymouth Airport to RNAS Yeovilton in early 2007, following the departure of the last Sea Harrier squadron from RNAS Yeovilton in 2006.

He played mostly as an outfielder for the Chunichi Dragons and the Seibu Lions of the Nippon Professional Baseball league in a career spanning 18 years. Following retirement in 2015, he has become a color commentator for Dragons broadcasts for the NHK. Early career Playing for Tohoku Fukushi University, Wada was MVP of the Sendai Big Six University League as a senior and won the batting title. He hit .429 for Kobe Seiko in the industrial leagues, then in 1996 was drafted in the fourth round of the Japanese draft by the Seibu Lions. Professional career=Seibu Lions He hit .190 in 1997 when he first played for Seibu and was 0/1 in the 1997 Japan Series. In 1998, Wada hit .333 in 36 games for Seibu and split his time between catching and the outfield. He went 0/2 in the 1998 Japan Series. In 1999, he batted .271 while again seeing limited time behind the plate, with Tsutomu Ito starting. In 1998, Wada began playing semiregularly as an outfielder, batting .306, the same average he recorded the next year. He still not yet an everyday player. In 2002, Wada finally became a starter and responded by batting .319 with 33 homers. Playing left field and DH, he made the Best Nine as the top designated hitter in the Pacific League. He finished third in slugging behind teammates Alex Cabrera and Kazuo Matsui. His Japan Series woes continued with a miserable 0/15 in the 2002 Japan Series, as Seibu got swept by the Yomiuri Giants. Wada did even better in 2003, hitting .346 (.379 with runners in scoring position), homering 30 times, scoring 87 runs and driving in 89. He made his first All-Star team and was on the Best Nine as an outfielder alongside Yoshitomo Tani and Tuffy Rhodes. Wada finished third in the Pacific League in average (behind Michihiro Ogasawara and Tani) and slugging (behind Cabera and Ogasawara). He was fourth in OBP behind Ogasawara, Tadahito Iguchi and Nobuhiko Matsunaka. 2004 was an eventful year for Wada. He hit .320 (.375 with RISP), homered 30 times and drove in 89 despite missing time for the 2004 Olympics. For the bronze medal- winning Japanese club in the Olympics, he hit .333 and slugged .636. Hitting cleanup or fifth for Seibu, he was honored again as an All-Star and Best Nine. In the 2004 Japan Series, he finally broke his postseason struggles in a big way by batting .310 with four homers in Seibu's victory over the Chunichi Dragons. Wada broke a 54-year-old record for most extra-base hits in a Japan Series with eight, breaking Isao Harimoto's record of 7 in the 1950 Japan Series. His 26 total bases were a Japan Series record, breaking Yasumitsu Toyoda's 46-year-old record of 25; he tied the record with four homers in a series and his two homers in game six helped Seibu to a 4-2 victory to tie the series at three. Takashi Ishii beat him out for Series MVP honors, though. Wada continued his dazzling pace in 2005, batting .322, though his 27 homers were his lowest total in four years. He made his fourth straight All-Star contingent. He edged Julio Zuleta (.319) and Matsunaka (.315) for the first Pacific League batting title won by a right-handed hitter since Hatsuhiko Tsuji in 1993. He was fourth in slugging, third in OBP, tied for third in runs (80), first in hits (153), second in doubles (32). Wada was on the winning Japanese club in the 2006 World Baseball Classic and went 0 of 2 with one strikeout in two games as the backup left fielder to Hitoshi Tamura. Wada hit .298 in 2006 and finished third in the PL with 95 RBI, second to Fernando Seguignol with 34 doubles, eighth with 144 hits, seventh with 239 total bases, tied for seventh with 72 runs, second with 78 walks (trailing only Matsunaka). He was fourth in OBP and eighth in slugging. His home run total continued to fall, down to 19, but still tied for seventh in the PL. He re-signed for Seibu for ¬•275 million plus incentives. Chunichi Dragons At the end of the 2007 season, Wada opted for free agency and joined boyhood club and reigning Japan Series champions, the Chunichi Dragons in a 3-year, ¬•840 million deal to replace MLB bound right-fielder, Kosuke Fukudome. Personal Wada's hobbies are fishing, pachinko and mah jong. Sources *This is a shortened version of the Baseball-Reference.com Bullpen article Kazuhiro Wada, accessed February 21, 2007.

Overview In an LNS, a number, X, is represented by the logarithm, x, of its absolute value as follows: :X\\\\rightarrow\\\\\\\\{s,x=\\\\log_b(X)\\\\\\\\}, where s is a bit denoting the sign of X (s=0 if X>0 and s=1 if X<0). The number x is represented by a binary word which usually is in the two's complement format. An LNS can be considered as a floating-point number with the significand being always equal to 1 and a non- integer exponent. This formulation simplifies the operations of multiplication, division, powers and roots, since they are reduced down to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, respectively. On the other hand, the operations of addition and subtraction are more complicated and they are calculated by the formula: :\\\\log_b(X+Y)=x+s_b(y-x) : \\\\log_b(X-Y)=x+d_b(y-x), where the \\"sum\\" function is defined by s_b(z)=\\\\log_b(1+b^z), and the \\"difference\\" function by d_b(z)=\\\\log_b(1-b^z). These functions s_b(z) and d_b(z) are also known as Gaussian logarithms. The simplification of multiplication, division, roots, and powers is counterbalanced by the cost of evaluating these functions for addition and subtraction. This added cost of evaluation may not be critical when using an LNS primarily for increasing the precision of floating-point math operations.  History  Logarithmic number systems have been independently invented and published at least three times as an alternative to fixed-point and floating- point number systems. Nicholas Kingsbury and Peter Rayner introduced \\"logarithmic arithmetic\\" for digital signal processing (DSP) in 1971. A similar LNS named \\"signed logarithmic number system\\" (SLNS) was described in 1975 by Earl Swartzlander and Aristides Alexopoulos; rather than use two's complement notation for the logarithms, they offset them (scale the numbers being represented) to avoid negative logs. Samuel Lee and Albert Edgar described a similar system, which they called the \\"Focus\\" number system, in 1977. The mathematical foundations for addition and subtraction in an LNS trace back to Zecchini Leonelli and Carl Friedrich Gauss in the early 1800s.  Applications  A LNS has been used in the Gravity Pipe (GRAPE-5) special- purpose supercomputer that won the Gordon Bell Prize in 1999. A substantial effort to explore the applicability of LNSs as a viable alternative to floating point for general-purpose processing of single-precision real numbers is described in the context of the European Logarithmic Microprocessor (ELM). A fabricated prototype of the processor, which has a 32-bit cotransformation- based LNS arithmetic logic unit (ALU), demonstrated LNSs as a \\"more accurate alternative to floating-point\\", with improved speed. Further improvement of the LNS design based on the ELM architecture has shown its capability to offer significantly higher speed and accuracy than floating-point as well. LNSs are sometimes used in FPGA-based applications where most arithmetic operations are multiplication or division.

A crescendo pedal is a large pedal commonly found on medium-sized and larger pipe organs (as well as digital organs), either partially or fully recessed within the organ console. The crescendo pedal incrementally activates stops as it is pressed forward and removes stops as it is depressed backward. The addition of stops, in order from quietest to loudest, creates the effect of a crescendo (and, likewise, a diminuendo, when the stops are deactivated). The crescendo pedal is located directly above the pedalboard, to the right of any expression pedals that may be present. In actual use, the operation of the crescendo pedal usually does not move the draw knobs or stop tabs on the console; the stops are electronically activated inside the organ. Often an indicator light or lights will be present on the console to inform the organist of when the crescendo pedal is activated and how far it is engaged. Rollschweller (left) and swell pedal (right) The earliest type of automatic crescendo device was the Rollschweller (German for \\"roll-sweller\\") or Walze (German for \\"roller\\"), seen in large Romantic music era organs of the nineteenth century, almost exclusively in Germany. It consists of a wheel and axle, which would be horizontally mounted directly above the pedalboard. When turned toward the organist, the wheel would activate a mechanism that would add stops to the registration. Likewise, turning the wheel back would remove stops. The Rollschweller is constructed so that it may be turned forward or backward indefinitely. This gives the device a much longer field of operation than the modern crescendo pedal, thus making the dynamic change more smooth and gradual. It is especially helpful and appropriate in the playing of the organ works of Max Reger, Franz Liszt, and Sigfrid Karg-Elert, who all wrote for organs that featured a Rollschweller. As the use of electricity became widespread in the early twentieth century, organ builders began to apply it to their instruments, electrifying the key action and the stop action as well as the expression pedals. An electrically operated crescendo pedal resembling an expression pedal was invented and mounted to the right of the expression pedals. The order in which the stops were activated by the crescendo pedal was set by the organ builder and could not be modified by the organist. This was the case until the later part of the twentieth century, when computerized devices were incorporated into console design, allowing greater customization of registration through more sophisticated combination actions. As a result, in organs with these devices, the stops controlled by the crescendo pedal are usually customizable, as is the order in which they are activated. Reed organs and harmoniums of the late 19th and early 20th centuries often had a similar mechanism to a crescendo pedal. Since the player's feet were needed to pedal the bellows that provided the wind for the instrument, the mechanism was operated by a 'paddle' lever moved by one of the player's knees (the paddle being located under the keyboard). Usually this was called a 'full organ pedal', as it did not gradually engage ranks of stops in the manner of a true crescendo pedal, but simply engaged all the stops (and usually any octave couplers fitted to the instrument) when operated, with no progressive action.  Use of the crescendo pedal  The crescendo pedal is typically used only in certain repertoire, and, generally speaking, the organ's expression pedal(s) are more commonly used. Because the crescendo pedal both resembles and is adjacent to the expression pedal(s), it may confuse beginning organists, such as pianists who are filling in at the church organ, who intend to use the expression pedal(s) rather than the crescendo pedal. To avoid this danger, the organist should look at the pedals before playing to ascertain if they are labeled, as well as practice locating the correct pedal by feel. When feeling for a pedal while playing, the organist should remember that the crescendo pedal is normally the right-most of the volume pedals, and that its surface is often raised slightly above the expression pedal(s) so as to help the organist to avoid selecting it by mistake.

This one is inscribed with \\"Lm may 3rd 1862 / Dave\\" David Drake, I made this jar for cash, though it is called lucre trash. Alkaline glaze stoneware, 1857. David Drake (c. 1800 ‚Äì c. 1870s), also known as \\"Dave Pottery\\" and \\"Dave the Potter,\\" was an American potter who lived in Edgefield, South Carolina. Drake produced over 100,000 alkaline- glazed stoneware jugs between the 1820s and the 1870s. An enslaved African American, he often signed his works \\"Dave.\\" He is recognized as the first enslaved potter to inscribe his work, during a time when most enslaved people were illiterate, often forbidden from literacy, and anonymous. Drake inscribed his work with poetry, often using rhyming couplets, as well as his signature. Life David Drake is thought to have been born the first half of the year 1800 on a plantation in South Carolina, owned by the Drake family. The first legal record of Drake is a description from June 13, 1818, that describes \\"a boy about 17 years old country born\\" who was \\"mortgaged to Eldrid Simkins by Harvey Drake\\". \\"Country born\\" refers to an enslaved African American who was born in the United States rather than Africa. During the antebellum period, Drake was one of the 76 known enslaved African American to have worked in Edgefield's twelve pottery factories. David Drake was first enslaved by Harvey Drake. Harvey Drake owned a large pottery business with his business partner Abner Landrum. This pottery business and the area, within which David Drake worked is known as Pottersville. Landrum was the publisher of a local newspaper called The Edgefield Hive. It is unclear how Drake learned to read and write. Scholars speculate he was taught by Landrum, who was known to be a religious man and may have taught Drake how to read the Bible. During this time period it was unusual for enslaved people to be literate, especially in South Carolina. Most southern states in the early 1800s restricted black literacy, and in 1830s legislation was passed laws prohibiting their education. South Carolina's Negro Act of 1740, prohibited teaching enslaved Africans to read and write, punishable by a fine of 100 pounds and six months in prison After the death of Harvey Drake, David Drake was enslaved by Rev. John Landrum. In 1846 Rev. Landrum passed away and all eighteen of the people he enslaved were put up for sale. Drake was then purchased and enslaved by Rev. Landrum's son, Franklin Landrum. Drake's treatment under Franklin Landrum was poor. During the period of his enslavement by Franklin Lundrum, Drake's wares were not inscribed and no poetry is thought to have been produced. In 1849, Lewis Miles bought and enslaved Drake. During the time Drake produced his largest amount of wares that included poetry. Miles' factory was known as 'Stony Bluff.' Drake's poetry at this time increased from one every few years to three in 1857, eight in 1858, and seven in 1859. At the end of the Civil War, Drake was a free man and it is thought he took the surname \\"Drake\\" from his first owner Harvey Drake. The name \\"David Drake\\" is recorded in the 1870 United States Census as \\"David Drake, turner.\\" It is thought that Drake died in the 1870s, as the names \\"David Drake\\" nor \\"Dave Drake\\" do not appear in the 1880 census. Pottery and work Drake's earliest recorded work is a pot dated July 12, 1834. The poetry on this vessel reads: Drake scholar, Jill Beute Koverman argues that Drake \\"made more than 40,000 pieces over his lifetime.\\" A total twenty of Drake's jars and jugs are inscribed with original poetry and fifty additional vessels reveal his signature, maker's mark, date, and other inscriptions. Drake's jars are bulbous in form, similar to most ware produced in antebellum Edgefield. Drake is known for the massive size of his ware and the largest jar attributed to Drake holds and measures tall, with a circumference of . One marker of Drake's work is that his jars are widest at the top - \\"They are wide-mouthed forms with thick, rolled rims and high broad shoulders. Contemporary potters who have examined Drake's thick-walled, large capacity storage jars are amazed at the great strength and skill that was required to produce vessels of such size.\\" The use of Drake's ware ranged from pitchers for buttermilk, jugs for molasses or whiskey, churns for butter, large jars for pickling vegetables or preserving meats such as venison and bear. Drake commonly used jugs, which he frequently adorned with short poems and couplets below the rim of the jar. Some of these were explanatory \\"Put every bit all between / surely this jar will hold 14;\\" and some were commentaries on the selling of slaves \\"I wonder where is all my relations / Friendship to all‚Äîand every nation.\\" This unusual feature of his work is one of his most famous trademarks. Some collectors and scholars have suggested that Drake's poetry should be characterized as an early act of sedition in the cause of civil rights, because at the time it was generally forbidden for African-Americans to read and write. Pieces by Drake frequently feature the initials \\"LM.\\" This stood for Lewis Miles, the man who owned the pottery workshop where Drake worked (Miles may have enslaved Dave for a time, starting in the late 1830s). Lewis Miles has even been referenced directly in one of Drake's couplets: \\"Dave belongs to Mr. Miles / Wher the oven bakes & the pot biles.\\" Legacy In 2010, the children's book Dave the Potter: Artist, Poet, Slave was written by Laban Carrick Hill and illustrated by Bryan Collier. The book gives a biography of Drake as well as his prowess for creating pottery. It won the Coretta Scott King Award and was a Caldecott Honor book in 2011. During Drake's lifetime his pots were worth around 50 cents; However today, they sell for as much as $50,000. In contemporary auctions and sales, his work has sold for over $40,000 per piece.\\"Dave the Potter\\" , University of South Carolina In 2008 Leonard Todd published a cohesive biography on Drake. Leonard Todd's interest lies in the fact that two of his ancestors enslaved Drake at some point in time. The 1998 exhibition The Life and Works of the Enslaved African American Potter, Dave at University of South Carolina's McKissick Museum was the first exhibition devoted solely to Drake's pottery. In 2010 contemporary artist Theaster Gates created an exhibition responding to and centering around the work of David Drake, titled Theaster Gates: To Speculate Darkly at the Milwaukee Art Museum. In this exhibitions Gates uses Drake's work to address issues of craft and race in the African American history. In 2016 an exhibition at the Vero Museum of Art titled David Drake: Potter and Poet contained 31 objects; 13 of which are known to be from Drake's hand. Collections Drake's work is in various collections, most notably the Southern Collection of the Greenville County Museum of Art (Greenville, SC), the Smithsonian collection of the National Museum of American History in Washington DC. Philadelphia Museum of Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the McKissick Museum at the University of South Carolina.

He authored several books about his military career, touching sensitive political subjects of the Mitterrand era. Barril was a gendarme until 1995. He was the second officer of the GIGN Special Forces unit for 10 years, before being involved in the creation of the Counterterrorist Cell of the √âlys√©e during Fran√ßois Mitterrand's first mandate from 1981 to 1988.\\"Un d√©jeuner avec Hallier (A Lunch with Jean-Edern Hallier), in Carr√© d'art : Byron, Barbey d'Aurevilly, Dali, Hallier, Jean-Pierre Thiollet, Anagramme, 2008, p. 190. Since then, he has led several private security companies. He has been in the centre of controversies for his role in Africa, particularly in Rwanda during the Rwandan genocide in 1994 during which extremist Hutus mass exterminated hundreds of thousands of ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Military career Barril was second officer of the GIGN from 1974 to 1982, as aid to commandant Christian Prouteau. In late 1979, he was dispatched to Saudi Arabia to help the Saudi government quell the Grand Mosque Seizure, an uprising at Islam's holiest shrine in Mecca that was led by fundamentalist preacher Juhayman al-Otaibi. Barril was interim commander of the GIGN in 1982-1983, while commandant Prouteau was organising the GSPR, a presidential security unit. Barril claims to having \\"arrested 115 people, being involved in the surrender of 61 madmen, neutralised 17 armed people without using weapons, and freed over 450 hostages.\\" After a car bomb explosion near a restaurant in Rue Marbeuf in Paris on 22 April 1982, Barril and Prouteau were involved in the creation of the Counterterrorist Cell of the Elys√©e, along with Prouteau. Barril was involved in several famous affairs, such as the so-called \\"Irish of Vincennes\\" and the Elys√©e wiretap scandal. Although rumors suggest Paul Barril has been convicted, his police record is clean and shows no signs of conviction.Document indicating Paul Barril has a clean police record and no charges of conviction Private security business After the \\"Irishmen from Vincennes\\" affair, in 1984, Barril created the company Epsylon in Paris.

In 1988, Barril organised an \\"action group\\" around President F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny in C√¥te d'Ivoire. Rwanda Barril was involved in Rwanda during the first half of the 90s. He went to Kigali right after the plane ferrying president Juv√©nal Habyarimana was shot down, as the genocide started. Barril stated that he acted as a councilor to Habyarimana.

Channing School is a member of the Girls' Schools Association. The junior school is for pupils aged four to eleven and includes the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS). The Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI), in April 2015, awarded Channing School the highest possible judgements in each category inspected, saying 'The quality of the pupils' achievements and learning is exceptional'. The Good Schools Guide called the school \\"A sheltered, isolated school in a beautiful setting, less pressured than many London girls' schools but still getting excellent results and producing self- assured young women.\\"Profile on Good Schools Guide  History  Channing School, originally called Channing House, first opened in 1885 in Sutherland House under the Revd. Robert Spears and was endowed by the Misses Matilda and Emily Sharpe, the daughters of Samuel Sharpe, primarily for the daughters of Unitarian ministers, and named after William Ellery Channing. Robert Spears later became the first minister of Highgate Unitarian Church. There was assistance for six pupils by private benefactions. After a year, numbers had risen to about 90 pupils and by 1925 to about 125. Ivy House, higher up the hill, was leased for dormitories and offices in 1885. In the same year the school also leased the semi-detached West View, immediately below Sutherland House and extended the frontage of both in 1887. In 1901 West View was bought, the other half of the semi-detached property, Slingley, was bought in 1921. This was done under the authority of Robert Mortimer Montgomery, who had been a Governor of the school since 1906, and became its chairman in December 1920.Walter H. Burgess, Unitarian Historical Society, Transactions of the Unitarian Historical Society (1949), Vol. 16‚Äì17, p. 154-155. The neighbouring building, Hampden House was acquired in 1925 and in 1930 the adjacent Arundel House; these two forming another pair of semi-detached houses. Fairseat, leased with two acres of land, was used from 1926. A hall was opened in 1927 and from 1931 the school became known simply as Channing School. Channing was badly damaged by a parachute mine during World War II. During the War, Montgomery oversaw the temporary relocation of the school and its pupils to the West Country, his last major effort before resigning from the chairmanship in 1944. Haigh House was built in 1954 to replace the damaged and bombed out buildings. In 1943 a Junior School opened at 12 Southwood Lane which was sold in 1955 when the junior school moved to Fairseat. There were 250 girls in 1950 and 390 in 1975.A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 6: Friern Barnet, Finchley, Hornsey with Highgate (1980), pp. 189‚Äì199.  Buildings  The Junior School (also known as Fairseat) was the home of Sir Sydney Waterlow, 1st Baronet, who donated the park next door to the public after he died. There is a statue of him on the highest point in the park (just behind Fairseat's Tennis Courts) which shows him holding a key which is said to be the key to the park which he is offering to the public. The Senior School has four buildings: Brunner House, Haigh House, Founders Hall and a complex completed in 2015 housing a Sixth Form Centre and a Sports Hall, with Fitness Suite. Founders Hall, once the Old Hall, was re-opened in February 2008 after renovations split the hall into two floors to extend the Sixth Form Centre. In 2014 Founders' Hall was renovated again to house a Music School with soundproofed practice rooms, a studio and teaching rooms. An upper floor was added to Brunner House in 2003, and constitutes staff offices and classrooms which double as the form rooms of year groups 7 to 9. Haigh House has the Science department, Art department, Mathematics department, ICT department, and dark room. The Mathematics department takes the place of the old dormitories, as the school was once a boarding school. A performing arts centre that seats 300 was completed in 2017.  Grounds  Channing Junior School's (Fairseat) Grounds are part of Sir Sydney Waterlow's park. In 2018 a large veteran Cedar of Lebanon had to be chopped down because it was infected with a fungus. Channing also has a cottage (It is called ' the Fairseat Cottage'), chicken coop, adventure playground and tennis courts. The School also owns a large expanse of grass on Stanhope Road where summer sports are played and the Channing Fireworks are held. Alumni * Elsie Chamberlain studied here before she worked for the BBC and was the \\"first woman\\" at several jobs within the church.  Pastoral Care  When new students join in Year 7, they are paired with a Year 8 girl who is there for support and guidance during the first year.

Removing such protected people from the United States constitutes a grave international crime, especially if they qualify as Americans or have physically and continuously resided in the United States for at least 10 years without committing (in such years) any offense that triggers removability.

Expansion of the definition of \\"nationals but not citizens of the United States\\" In 1986, less than a year before the United Nations Convention against Torture (CAT) became effective, Congress expressly and intentionally expanded the definition of \\"nationals but not citizens of the United States\\" by adding paragraph (4) to 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1408, which states that: The natural reading of ¬ß 1408(4) demonstrates that it was not exclusively written for the 55,000 American Samoans but for all people who statutorily and manifestly qualify as \\"nationals but not citizens of the United States.\\" (explaining that lawful permanent residents may lawfully remain outside the United States for up to one year (or even longer) in certain situations). This means that any person who can show by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she meets (or at any time has met) the requirements of 8 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1408(4), 1427, 1429, 1436, and/or 1452, is plainly and unambiguously an American.Ricketts v.

Introduction and amendment of the term \\"aggravated felony\\" In 1988, Congress introduced the term \\"aggravated felony\\" by defining it under 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1101(a), which was amended several times over the years. As of September 30, 1996, an \\"aggravated felony\\" only applies to convictions \\"for which the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous 15 years.\\" (emphasis added); Matter of Vasquez-Muniz, 23 I&N; Dec. 207, 211 (BIA 2002) (en banc) (\\"This penultimate sentence, governing the enumeration of crimes in section 101(a)(43) of the Act, refers the reader to all of the crimes 'described in' the aggravated felony provision.\\"); Luna Torres v.

Holder, 636 F.3d 1059, 1080 (9th Cir. 2010) (\\"[Petitioner] is not removable by reason of being an aggravated felon, because 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) does not apply to convictions, like [Petitioner]'s, that occurred prior to November 18, 1988.\\"); but see Canto v. Holder, 593 F.3d 638, 640-42 (7th Cir. 2010) (good example of absurdity and deprivation of rights), cert. denied, 131 S.Ct. 85 (2010) (Question Presented: \\"Are individuals who went to trial entitled to the same relief provided in St. Cyr such that they may continue to seek waiver of deportation under Section 212(c) despite its repeal?\\" Here, p.3, the \\"15 years\\" argument had been completely waived). After the successful elapse of said \\"15 years\\" (i.e., without sustaining another aggravated felony conviction), a longtime LPR automatically becomes entitled to both cancellation of removal and a waiver of inadmissibility. He or she may (at any time and from anywhere in the world) request these popular immigration benefits depending on whichever is more applicable or easiest to obtain.Salmoran v. Attorney General of the U.S., ___ F.3d ___, ___, No. 17-2683, p.5 n.5 (3d Cir. Nov. 26, 2018) (case involving cancellation of removal after the LPR has been physically removed from the United States on a bogus aggravated felony charge). The phrase \\"term of imprisonment\\" in the INA expressly excludes all probationary periods. Only a court-imposed suspended sentence (i.e., suspended term of imprisonment) is included, which must be added to the above 15 years, and it makes no difference if the aggravated felony conviction was sustained in Afghanistan, American Samoa, Australia, Canada, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, or in any other country or place in the world.See generally, Chavez-Alvarez v. Warden York County Prison, 783 F.3d 469 (3d Cir. 2015) (\\"[Petitioner], a citizen of Mexico, entered the United States at a young age without inspection and later adjusted to lawful permanent resident status....

He served thirteen months in prison and was released on February 4, 2002.\\"); Chavez- Alvarez v. Att'y Gen., 783 F.3d 478 (3d Cir. 2015); Matter of Chavez-Alvarez, 26 I&N; Dec. 274 (BIA 2014). Consequences of an aggravated felony conviction permanent resident card (green card), which lawfully permits its holder to live and work in the United States similar to that of all other Americans. Before any legal immigrant is naturalized as a U.S. citizen, he or she must be a green card holder for at least 5 years and satisfy all other INA's naturalization requirements. Many green card holders are actually Americans without them knowing, and are thus not removable from the United States. In February 1995, while IIRIRA was being prepared, U.S. President Bill Clinton issued an important directive in which he expressly stated the following: Despite what President Clinton said in the above directive, some plainly incompetent immigration officers began deporting longtime LPRs (i.e., potential Americans). Many of these legal immigrants were firmly resettled and non-deportable refugees, who statutorily qualified as Americans after continuously residing in the United States for at least 10 years without committing (in such years) any offense that triggers removability. (stating that an LPR, especially a wrongfully deported LPR, is permitted to reenter the United States by any means whatsoever, including with a grant of \\"relief under section 1182(h) or 1229b(a) of this title....\\") (emphasis added); accord United States v. Aguilera-Rios, 769 F.3d 626, 628-29 (9th Cir. 2014) (\\"[Petitioner] was convicted of a California firearms offense, removed from the United States on the basis of that conviction, and, when he returned to the country, tried and convicted of illegal reentry under . He contends that his prior removal order was invalid because his conviction ... was not a categorical match for the Immigration and Nationality Act's ('INA') firearms offense. We agree that he was not originally removable as charged, and so could not be convicted of illegal reentry.\\"); see also Matter of Campos- Torres, 22 I&N; Dec. 1289 (BIA 2000) (en banc) (A firearms offense that renders an alien removable under section 237(a)(2)(C) of the Act, (Supp. II 1996), is not one 'referred to in section 212(a)(2)' and thus does not stop the further accrual of continuous residence or continuous physical presence for purposes of establishing eligibility for cancellation of removal.\\"); Vartelas v. Holder, 566 U.S. 257, 262 (2012); City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985) (\\"The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that ... all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\\"). This appears to be the reason why the permanent resident card (green card) is valid for 10 years. It was expected that all refugees in the United States would equally obtain U.S. citizenship within 10 years from the date of their lawful entry, (\\"The terms 'admission' and 'admitted' mean, with respect to an alien, the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.\\") (emphasis added); Matter of D-K-, 25 I&N; Dec. 761, 765-66 (BIA 2012).See generally but if that was unachievable then they would statutorily become \\"nationals but not citizens of the United States\\" after the successful elapsing of such continuous 10 years.Robinson v.

This specific class of people owe permanent allegiance solely to the United States, and that obviously makes them nothing but Americans. (\\"The term 'lawfully admitted for permanent residence' means the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws, such status not having changed.\\").

However, unlike a \\"national but not a citizen of the United States,\\" an alien convicted of any aggravated felony statutorily becomes \\"removable\\" from the United States, but only if his or her \\"term of imprisonment was completed within the previous 15 years.\\" In other words, such alien cannot: * have his or her removal proceedings terminated without a written legal order issued by any immigration judge or member of the BIA, or an injunction issued by any federal judge. * be admitted to the United States prior to being granted a waiver of inadmissibility or cancellation of removal by any authorized U.S. immigration official, or \\"a full and unconditional pardon by the President of the United States or by the Governor of any of the several States.\\" * obtain asylum in the United States unless he or she was previously admitted to the United States as a refugee, or his or her aggravated felony was shown not to be a particularly serious crime.; Gomez- Sanchez v.

Jan. 10, 2019) (stating that courts of appeals \\"have held that, when determining whether a [state] offense is 'punishable' by more than one year in prison, the Supreme Court's recent cases require an examination of the maximum sentence possible under the state's mandatory sentencing guidelines.\\"). In this regard, Judge Becker of the Third Circuit had explained in 1999 the following: It is important to note that a court cannot defy a clearly-established law. Under the INA, a crime must be punishable by imprisonment for a term \\"exceeding\\" one year in order to be considered a conviction of a \\"crime involving moral turpitude\\" (CIMT) or an aggravated felony.Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U.S. 654, 670 n.10 (2002) (\\"In Pennsylvania, for example, ... only those charged with 'summary offenses' (violations not technically considered crimes and punishable by no more than 90 days' imprisonment, ... may receive a suspended sentence uncounseled. (Typical 'summary offenses' in Pennsylvania include the failure to return a library book within 30 days, ... and fishing on a Sunday [.])\\" (citations omitted). Anything to the contrary will lead to an absurd result and a blatant violation of the U.S. Constitution. (emphasis added). (emphasis added). Plus, it will damage the reputation of the appellate court,United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993). which suppose to play a more neutral role in removal proceedings under the INA because they are obviously not criminal proceedings. Congress has long stated in that \\"[t]he term [aggravated felony] does not include ... any State offense classified by the laws of the State as a misdemeanor and punishable by a term of imprisonment of two years or less.\\" This expressed language of Congress was in effect in 1988 (when the aggravated felony was coined for the first time) and is still in effect today. Section 921(a)(20) applies to the entire Chapter 44 (¬ß¬ß 921-931) of title 18. As such, ¬ß 921(a)(20) controls 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1101(a)(43), especially subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F) and (G). Under ¬ß 921(a)(20), Congress says this: \\"What constitutes a conviction of such a crime shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held.\\" This simply means that the federal felony definition controls in all immigration-related cases.Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 47 (2006) (\\"The question raised is whether conduct made a felony under state law but a misdemeanor under the Controlled Substances Act is a \\"felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\\" . We hold it is not.\\") (emphasis added). More importantly, in ¬ß 927 (\\"Effect on State law\\"), Congress expressly states: \\"No provision of this chapter shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to occupy the field in which such provision operates to the exclusion of the law of any State on the same subject matter....\\" The phrase \\"[n]o provision of this chapter\\" statutorily covers (among many other crimes) every crime of violence and theft.See generally United States v. Barret, ___ F.3d ___, No. 14-2641 (2d Cir. 2018); United States v. Pereira-Gomez, ___ F.3d ___, ___, No. 17-952, p.6 note 4 (2d Cir. 2018) (defining \\"crime of violence\\"). See also the below section: Comparison of an aggravated felony to a crime involving moral turpitude. Precedents relating to \\"crime of violence\\" under U.S. law In 2001, the Fifth Circuit held \\"that because intentional force against the person or property of another is seldom, if ever, employed to commit the offense of felony DWI, such offense is not a crime of violence within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 16(b).\\"United States v. Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d 921, 928 (5th Cir. 2001). Later in the same year, the Third Circuit held that unintentional vehicular homicide is not an aggravated felony.Francis v.

Ashcroft (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court held that driving under the influence is not an aggravated felony if the DUI statute that defines the offense does not contain a mens rea element or otherwise allows a conviction for merely negligent conduct.

In the case of an LPR, the CIMT must be committed within 5 years of his or her admission to the United States. However, despite the obvious differences, both classes of aliens are statutorily entitled to a waiver of inadmissibility and cancellation of removal, so long as \\"the maximum penalty possible for the crime of which the alien[s] w[ere] convicted ... did not exceed imprisonment for one year....\\" (emphasis added). Any period of incarceration or confinement that was subsequently added due to probation/parole violation plainly does not count. If the total period served inside a penal institution was less than 180 days (i.e., 6 months), the LPR is manifestly entitled to U.S. citizenship, provided that the remaining citizenship requirements are fulfilled. Such person may be naturalized at any time,Gonzalez v. Secretary of DHS, 678 F.3d 254, 160-61 (3d Cir. 2012) (\\"Declaratory relief, in the form of a judgment regarding the lawfulness of the denial of naturalization, permits the alien a day in court, as required by ¬ß 1421(c), while not upsetting the priority of removal over naturalization established in ¬ß 1429 because it affects the record for‚Äîbut not the priority of‚Äîremoval proceedings, thereby preserving both congressionally mandated goals, a de novo review process and the elimination of the race to the courthouse.\\") whether in the United States or (in particular cases) at any U.S. embassy around the world. (\\"A person may file an application for naturalization other than in the office of the Attorney General, and an oath of allegiance administered other than in a public ceremony before the Attorney General or a court, if the Attorney General determines that the person has an illness or other disability which... is of a nature which so incapacitates the person as to prevent him from personally appearing.\\") (emphasis added); see also (\\"The Attorney General may, in his discretion, waive a personal investigation in an individual case or in such cases or classes of cases as may be designated by him.\\") (emphasis added). The consequences of making a crime an \\"aggravated felony\\" are far reaching. One major consequence is that, unlike the deportation ground for a CIMT, an aggravated felony does not necessarily have to be committed within five years from the alien's entry or admission into the United States to make him or her removable. An alien who cannot demonstrate U.S. nationality is removable even if the alien has committed an aggravated felony in a foreign country, either before or after entering the United States. In this regard, the INA expressly states the following: 8 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1101(a)(43) and \\"1252(f)(2) should be interpreted to avoid absurd results.\\"Maharaj v. Ashcroft, 295 F.3d 963, 966 (9th Cir. 2002). Section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) states that every \\"alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\\" (emphasis added). It is obviously an absurd result to presume that the \\"15 years\\" in the above quoted provision applies only to those who were convicted of an aggravated felony in countries outside the United States. The plain language and skillful structure of the above quoted provision defeats that presumption because all the crimes enumerated in ¬ß 1101(a)(43) are obviously in violation of the law of every country on earth. There are countless other cogent reasons why Congress never intended such a bizarre and unconstitutional result. It would basically mean that Congress is somehow advising admitted aliens to, inter alia, murder or rape a person in Mexico instead of the United States. It would ridiculously ban all LPRs but allow only illegal aliens convicted of aggravated felonies outside the United States to receive immigration benefits. The only logical explanation is that the above 15-year period equally rehabilitates all non-citizens against committing another aggravated felony. Notwithstanding any other provision of law \\"The ordinary meaning of 'notwithstanding' is 'in spite of,' or 'without prevention or obstruction from or by.'\\"NLRB v. SW General, Inc., 580 U.S. ___, ___, 137 S.Ct. 929, 939 (2017). Congress is clearly and unambiguously saying that the penultimate provision under ¬ß 1101(a)(43), as quoted above, controls over the text of ¬ß¬ß 1101(f)(8), 1158(b)(2)(B)(i), 1225, 1226(c)(1)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1228, 1229b(a), 1231, 1252(a)(2)(C), etc.Perez-Guzman v. Lynch, 835 F.3d 1066, 1075 (9th Cir. 2016) (\\"When two statutes come into conflict, courts assume Congress intended specific provisions to prevail over more general ones....\\"). \\"In statutes, the [notwithstanding any other provision of law] 'shows which provision prevails in the event of a clash.'\\" Courts have long explained that \\"the phrase 'notwithstanding any other provision of law' expresses the legislative intent to override all contrary statutory and decisional law.\\"In re JMC Telecom LLC, 416 B.R. 738, 743 (C.D.

Alpine Ridge Group, 508 U.S. 10, 18 (1993) (collecting cases). What this means is that holdings such as Stone v.

April 1, 1997). Its intent was sufficiently shown when amending ¬ß 1252 during the enactment of the Real ID Act of 2005. There, it added \\"(statutory or nonstatutory)\\" after every relevant \\"notwithstanding any other provision of law\\" in ¬ß 1252.

In other words, the lives of these vulnerable people should not be in the hands of a few judges, who often make serious reversible errors in immigration-related cases.See, e.g., Trump v.

Every non-immigrant convicted of any aggravated felony and lawfully removed \\"must remain outside of the United States for twenty consecutive years from the deportation date before he or she is eligible to re-enter the United States.\\" That stringent rule, however, does not apply to legal immigrants (i.e., refugees and LPRs) who have been deported as aggravated felons.

Many previously removed people are believed to be residing inside the United States, some of whom have been removed from the United States about a dozen of times. According to the INA, it is a federal crime for any non-criminal alien to illegally enter the United States after that alien has been denied entry, excluded, removed, deported, or if he or she has departed the United States while an order of removal was outstanding. The maximum sentence for this crime is 2 years of imprisonment. However, if he or she was a criminal alien and \\"whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of three or more misdemeanors involving drugs, crimes against the person, or both, or a felony (other than an aggravated felony), such alien shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\\" The penalty can be increased to as high as 20 years of imprisonment in the case of an alien who was convicted of a particularly serious crime or an aggravated felony and then illegally reentered the United States. Such penalty, however, is extremely rare since no alien has received that many years of imprisonment. Most defendants in such cases receive around 5 years of imprisonment. The only person saved from guilt and serving any imprisonment for illegal reentry after deportation is someone who \\"was not originally removable as charged, and so could not be convicted of illegal reentry.\\"United States v. Aguilera-Rios, 769 F.3d 626, 628-29 (9th Cir. 2014); see also United States v. Valdivia-Flores, 876 F.3d 1201, 1210 (9th Cir. 2017) (\\"Because [Petitioner]'s drug trafficking conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony under the categorical approach, it cannot support the asserted basis for [Petitioner]'s 2009 removal.

The club originally played both association football and rugby football and the Civil Service, along with Blackheath F.C., is one of the two clubs that can claim to be a founder member of both The Football Association and the Rugby Football Union. However, the rugby club is now a distinct entity and appears to have been so since the late nineteenth century. They are currently members of the . History In 1863 the newly formed Civil Service club was playing football under both Association and Rugby rules and sources suggest that the club was similar to Clapham Rovers in that it was a single club playing both codes. At what point the Civil Service Rugby Club became a distinct entity from the Football Club (Association football) is unclear. Certainly, the histories published by the official Football and Rugby clubs respectively do not refer to a joint history past even 1863. However, the club was still a unified entity when it became a founding member of the Rugby Football Union in 1871, although notably it did not provide a member to the inaugural committee. However, in 1892 contemporary sources refer to Clapham Rovers as being unique in the respect that it played both codes, suggesting that the Civil Service had distinct teams by that point. Association Football The Civil Service team of 1893. The club was one of the dozen founding sides of the Football Association on 26 October 1863, and lays claim to an earlier, but uncertain, date of origin. It was represented at the founder's meeting by Mr. Warne of the War Office, leading to the side often being identified as the War Office Club in historical accounts of the founding of the FA. Civil Service was also one of the fifteen entrants to the first ever FA Cup competition in 1871‚Äì72. Several members of the Civil Service took a prominent role in organising the first representative matches between sides representing England and Scotland in 1870. The captain of the first Scottish XI was James Kirkpatrick (later Sir James Kirkpatrick, 8th Baronet) who included fellow civil servants Charles and William Baillie-Hamilton and William Lindsay in the team, while the England XI included William C. Butler and Evelyn Freeth. Civil Service played a significant role in the introduction and popularization of the game of football in Europe early in the 1900s through touring, undertaking their first continental tour in 1901. In recognition of their contributions the club is an honorary life member of Real Madrid and Slavia Prague. Early in the club's history the decision was taken to remain an amateur side in the face of the emergence of the professional game. Civil Service was subsequently active in the formation of several amateur leagues including the Amateur Football Alliance, the Isthmian League (1906), and the Southern Amateur Football League (1907). CSFC enjoyed its greatest success in the years leading up to World War I with several wins in other cup competitions to its credit including the London Senior Cup (1901), the Middlesex Senior Cup (1908 and 1913), and the Amateur Football Association Cup (1910, and again later in 1920 and 1930). They also captured the Southern Amateur League title in 1913 and 1914. In later years club's accumulation of honours was modest with a SAL title in 1939 and two more league triumphs in 1969 and 1971. They captured the AFA Senior Cup in 1997 with a 4‚Äì3 win over Lensbury, securing the trophy for the first time in 67 years. The club has eight sides competing in the Southern Amateur League and a Vets side playing in the West London Veterans League. It has also established a Women's section with a view to them entering a league in 2019/20. The club played in the first ever official football match at Buckingham Palace in October 2013 to mark the Football Association's 150th anniversary.

It was launched by in February 2007 as a social movement, but was transformed into a political party in July that year. It did not participate in the 2009 elections for the Knesset but made a comeback to run in the 2013 elections. It did not participate in the 2015 elections Background The movement was founded on 21 February 2007. It had been announced in the Israeli media the previous day that he would be founding a political party. The new organisation was not originally a party, but Gaydamak stated that it could turn into one at any time \\"given the circumstances\\". At the time he suggested the movement would not seek ultimate power for itself, telling voters \\"Don't vote for Olmert, don't vote for Peretz [then leader of Labour]‚Äîdon't even vote for Gaydamak. Vote for Bibi.\\" Nevertheless, a poll from late February gave Gaydamak's party 14 seats,Likud First, Gaydamak Ties Labour in Israel Angus Reid Global Monitor while a late March poll indicated it would receive 9 seats if elections for the Knesset were held (compared to 31 for Likud, 17 for Labour and 11 for Kadima). On 10 July 2007 Gaydamak launched Social Justice as a full political party, stating that the need to oust Ehud Olmert's government justified the creation of a new party. Claiming it could win 20 seats in the next elections and that he was the \\"most popular public figure in Israel\\", Gaydamak also said that he would not seek to enter the Knesset himself, though he would like to play a major role in Israeli politics. It was originally suggested that the party is likely to run in tandem with Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud, hoping to pick up votes from former Likud members alienated by Netanyahu's financial policies, and even that the movement could eventually merge into Likud. However, following the party's official launch, associates of Gaydamak said that he was not ruling out supporting Labour's Ehud Barak. According to polls in August 2007, support for the party had dropped below the threshold needed to win a seat in the Knesset. However, these polls were taken prior to the party's large municipal effort in 2008. Gaydamak is also popular in development towns, such as Sderot, and in the Israeli Arab, Bedouin, Druze and ultra-orthodox communities. In January 2008, Gaydamark claimed that his party was the largest in Israel, with 140,000 members (though unlike paid membership of other parties, the figure represented the number of people who had reportedly signed to say they supported the party). According to polls in the same month, the party could win seven seats in the Knesset. However, polls taken in October 2008 showed the party again failing to cross the electoral threshold.

They are considered a nuisance because they frequently stroll through local towns, camps, backyards, and streets because of their curiosity and easy food sources such as garbage. While black bear attacks are exceedingly rare, they can pose a risk to public safety when food conditioned and habituated to humans due to an availability of human food sources. As many as 100,000 black bears live in Alaska. Polar bear Polar bears on the Beaufort Sea coast. Alaska's polar bear populations are concentrated along its Arctic coastlines. In the winter, they are most common in the Kuskokwim Delta, St. Matthew Island, and at the southernmost portion of St. Lawrence Island. During the summer months, they migrate to the coastlines of the Arctic Ocean and the Chukchi Sea.Alaska Department of Fish & Game. \\"Polar Bear.\\" 2005-5-23. Retrieved on February 8, 2007 There are two main polar bear populations in Alaska. The Chukchi population is found off in the western part of Alaska near the Wrangell Islands, and the Beaufort Sea population is located near Alaska's North Slope. Until the late 1940s, polar bears were hunted almost exclusively for subsistence by Inupiats and dogs teams, though from the late 1940s until 1972, sport hunting by others took place. The 1959 Statehood Act set up a program for polar bear management, and further conservation efforts, including the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act, have limited polar bear hunts. Polar bear populations may be threatened by oil development and global warming.Some areas are affected more than others. Antarctica is affected by global warming more than Alaska. The ice doesn't melt as quickly in Alaska compared to Antarctica.BBC News  Sci/Tech  Global warming could starve polar bears Only about 4700 polar bears are known to inhabit Alaska. Caribou Caribou on the Alaska 250px Alaska is home to the caribou subspecies Rangifer tarandus granti.Alaska Department of Fish & Game \\"Caribou.\\" 2005-5-23. Retrieved on February 6, 2007. While other parts of the world use the terms \\"caribou\\" and \\"reindeer\\" synonymously, in Alaska \\"reindeer\\" refers exclusively to domesticated caribou. Caribou in Alaska generally are found in tundra and mountain regions, where there are few trees. However, many herds spend the winter months in the boreal forest areas. Caribou are large-scale migratory animals and have been known to travel up to a day. The migratory activities of caribou are usually driven by weather conditions and food availability. Changes in caribou migration can be problematic for Alaska Natives, who depend on caribou for food. Caribou in Alaska are abundant; currently there are an estimated 950,000 in the state. The populations of caribou are controlled by predators and hunters (who shoot about 22,000 caribou a year). Though in the 1970s there were worries that oil drilling and development in Alaska would harm caribou populations, they seem to have adapted to the presence of humans, and so far there have been few adverse effects. Moose Bull moose in 250px The Alaskan subspecies of moose (Alces alces gigas) is the largest in the world; adult males weigh 1,200 to 1,600 pounds (542‚Äì725 kg), and adult females weigh 800 to 1,300 pounds (364‚Äì591 kg)Alaska Department of Fish & Game: Moose. 2005-5-23. Retrieved on February 6, 2007. http://www.adfg.state.ak.us/pubs/notebook/biggame/moose.php Alaska's substantial moose population is controlled by predators such as bears and wolves, which prey mainly on vulnerable calves, as well as by hunters. Because of the abundance of moose in Alaska, moose-human interactions are frequent. Moose have played an important role in the state's history; professional hunters once supplied moose meat to feed mining camps. Athabascan people have hunted them to provide food as well as supplies for clothing and tools. They are now hunted frequently by big game hunters, who take 6,000 to 8,000 moose per year. Today, moose are often seen feeding and grazing along the state's highways. Moose can sometimes cause problems, as when they eat crops, stand in the middle of airfields, or dangerously cross the path of cars and trains. Moose are also a very popular icon in Alaska. Mountain goat Mountain goats are found in the rough and rocky mountain regions of Alaska, throughout the southeastern Panhandle and along the Coastal Mountains of the Cook Inlet.Alaska Department of Fish & Game: Mountain Goat. 2005-5-23. Retrieved on February 6, 2007. http://www.adfg.state.ak.us/pubs/notebook/biggame/mtn_goat.php Populations are generally confined in the areas of the Chugach and Wrangell Mountains. Mountain goats have been transplanted to the islands of Baranof and Kodiak, where they have maintained a steady population. The mountain goat is the only representation in North America of the goat-like ungulates. Very little was known about mountain goats up until 1900. They constantly migrate to different areas from the alpine ridges in the summer, and to the tree-line in the winter. Bison The ancestors of the American bison (Bison bison) now in Alaska were transplanted from Montana in 1928, when 20 animals were imported by the Alaska Game Commission and released in the area of what is now Delta Junction. Additional herds have developed along the Copper River, Chitina River, and near Farewell from natural emigration and transplant. Small domesticated herds have also been established near Kodiak and Delta Junction, as well as on Popov Island.Alaska Department of Fish & Game: American Bison. 1994.

The combined effects of pre-contact habitat change and human harvest were probably responsible for their disappearance. The last reported sighting of wood bison in Alaska was in the early 1900s. Oral history accounts from Alaska Native elders suggest that these bison were a resource for indigenous peoples in Alaska as recently as 200 years ago.Restoring Wood Bison in Alaska: Frequently Asked Questions\\" 2003-10-28.

The Alaska Department of Fish and Game is currently reviewing plans to reintroduce wood bison to Alaska from Canada. Dall sheep 250pxDall sheep live, rest, and feed in the mountain regions of Alaska where there is rocky terrain and steep, inclined land,Alaska Department of Fish & Game: Dall Sheep. 2005-5-23. Retrieved on February 8, 2007. and are occasionally seen below their usual high elevation only when food is scarce. In their rocky environment, they are able to avoid predators and human activities. Alaska contains a good size population of dall sheep, and are commonly sighted in the eastern and western sides of Denali National Park. The most commonly known name for the male Dall sheep is a \\"ram\\" and they are distinguishable from the female Dall sheep, the ewe, by their thicker and more massive curling horns. The curling of the horns on a male Dall sheep correlate with age, and reach their full circular potential in seven to eight years. Orca Orca The orca is also known as the killer whale, despite the term receiving controversy over the fact that orcas are part of the dolphin family. The term was granted because of the way in which the orcas hunt in large groups. The hunting style has often been compared to that of wolves. Another reason is their tendencies to eat other whales and large prey animals such as seals and sea lions.Alaska Department of Fish & Game: Orca. 2005-5-23. Retrieved on February 8, 2007. Orcas in Alaska are notable for their size; the adult female orca can reach the length of twenty-three feet whilst the adult male orca can reach up to twenty-seven feet. Orcas are scattered among the Continental Shelf from southeast Alaska through the Aleutian Islands. They can also be seen in the waters of Prince William Sound.  Birds 150px Hundreds of bird speciess inhabit Alaska, especially in coastal regions. Some of the more notable birds in Alaska include: * American dipper * Tengmalm's or boreal owl * Canada goose * Bald eagle * Gyrfalcon * Great grey owl * Northern hawk owl * Snowy owl * Harlequin duck * King eider * Osprey * Sandhill crane * Rusty blackbird * Common raven * Lapland longspur * Snow bunting * Willow ptarmigan * Horned puffin  Reptiles = Turtles  The Alaskan waters are home to two species of turtles. They are the leatherback sea turtle and the green sea turtle.Alaska Department of Fish & Game: Turtle. 2005-5-23. Retrieved on February 6, 2007. = Leatherback sea turtle = Leatherback sea turtles often inhabit open waters but are still sometimes seen on coastal waters because of their title of the most migratory sea turtle species. It is the largest turtle in the world, weighing up to two thousand pounds and reaching up to six and a half feet by their adult years. The shell of the leatherback turtle, also called a carapace, can develop to one and a half inches and is the only shell on a sea turtle that is not hard and boney but rather soft and leather like to the touch. The front flippers on the leatherback turtle are not equipped with scales and claws unlike other species, and they outgrow the flippers on other species of sea turtles. = Green sea turtle = The green sea turtle is named after its distinct green skin color, contrary to the idea that the green comes from their shell, which is typically brown or a dark olive. This turtle is capable of gaining up to 700 pounds and growing up to 5 feet. Most of these turtles live in coastal waters near Europe and North America. The male green sea turtle is larger in size than the female, and they also have longer tails. Both turtles have paddle shaped flippers that they use to burrow in sand and lay their eggs. One Green Sea Turtle can have up to 200 eggs. Amphibians= Frogs  Alaska has two species of frogs. They are the Columbia spotted frog and wood frog. Alaska also is inhabited by two introduced frog species, the Pacific tree frog (also referenced as the Pacific chorus frog), and the red-legged frog. The only species of toad in Alaska is the western toad.Alaska Department of Fish & Game: Frogs & Toads. 2005-5-23. Retrieved on February 6, 2007. = Pacific chorus frog = The Pacific chorus frog's name derives from their auditory performance in their mating call. The two-note male can signal a mating call via the two large and round vocal sacs that inflate beneath the chin repeatedly, sounding like a chorus. The Pacific chorus frog itself is visually identified as a frog reaching up to two inches long with a black stripe extending from the nose tip to shoulder, whose color changes with the temperature and humidity. = Red-legged tree frog = The red-legged tree frog can grow past five inches given their long hind legs and elongated abdomen. The body is translucent red. This species of tree frogs live in wet environments such as wetlands and moist forest and typically breed in well shaded streams and rivers. = Columbia spotted frog = The Columbia spotted frog is typically dark brown, grey, or green and has spots on its back and sides. It lives in aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, ponds, and marshes. They typically breed in aquatic areas such as still rivers and breed between 200 and 500 eggs at a time. = Wood frog = The wood frog is a light brown frog with dark patches over its eyes and extending down its back. These palm size frogs typically grow up to 3 inches. The Wood Frog is notorious for its verbal spring calling to attract other frogs, which is short and harsh. This frog gets its name from its habitat choice, which consists of heavily forested areas containing rocks, trees, and more. The Wood Frog however, breeds in wetlands and can breed up to 3,000 eggs at a time. = Western toad = The western toad is a large toad that has small circular or oval shaped warts down its back. This toad is often green or brown and have dark parotoid glands above the eyes. The eyes on the western toad are horizontal, unlike other toads who have vertical pupils. Western toads inhabit low elevation aquatic areas like wetlands, lake shores, wet meadows, marshes, and beaver ponds.  Salamanders  Alaska is also home to three species of salamanders; they are the northwestern salamander, long-toed salamander, and rough-skinned newt. = Northwestern salamander = Ambystoma gracile, the northwestern salamander, is a dark brown salamander reaching up to 23 centimeters long with dark protruding eyes and a visible parotoid glands. This salamander can be poisonous to its predators because of the excretion of a white poison through its glands when threatened. The northwestern salamander inhabits both forest and water bodies, but has a proclivity to live in burrows in the forest. The salamander also chooses to live under rocks, debris, and trees in the forest environment. = Long-toed salamander = Ambystoma macrodactylum, the long-toed salamander, is a salamander that occupies widespread regions, including the coastal regions of the pacific northwest. Long-toed salamanders live in a variety of habitats including sagebrush communities, coniferous forest, and in alpine meadows. Eggs and larvae have been spotted in watery areas including lakes, ponds, wetlands, springs, and puddles. An adult salamander can grow between 5 centimeters and 8.1 centimeters and are typically black with multicolored dorsal stripes and white speckling on their sides. This salamander has a long hind toe, which is where the name is derived from. = Rough-skinned newt = Taricha granulosa, the rough-skinned newt, is a salamander. This newt is multicolored, typically light brown on the back and yellow bellied, but can sometimes be olive green on the back. The rough-skinned newt is capable of growing up to 26.1 centimeters and will typically reach at least 12.7 centimeters. The newt's name comes from the granular and rough texture on their skin. The skin on the newt is toxic and releases a powerful neurotoxin called Tetrodotoxin, which can effect mucous glands and skin. Fish Alaska has quite a variety of fish species. Its lakes, rivers, and oceans are home to fish, some including trout, salmon, char, grayling, halibut, lampreys, lingcod, longnose sucker, pacific herring, black rockfish, salmon shark, sculpin, walleye pollock, white sturgeon, and various forms of whitefish.Johnson, S.W. et al.

Silver Spring, MD.: U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, 2012. Retrieved on February 12, 2014.  Salmon  School of salmon Alaska is home to five species of salmon: The chum salmon, which is banded green, yellow, and purple with a white tip on the anal fin, sockeye salmon, a deep red salmon with a white mouth, coho salmon, a maroon salmon with black spots, the Chinook salmon, also called the \\"king salmon\\", has a black gum line and black mouth and the pink salmon, which can be distinguished by its small size and overall pink hue. Every year, the salmon participate in the great spawning migration up against the river currents. They do this in large numbers and are frequently seen jumping out of the water. This is a physical effort of them trying to go against the current. Bears, particularly brown bears, take advantage of this event by swarming to the rivers, and indulging in the salmon feast. Bear Lake, near Seward on the Kenai Peninsula, has been the site of salmon enhancement activities since 1962.  Rainbow trout  The most common types of rainbow trout that lives in Alaska are the stream-resident and the steelhead. The rainbow trout lives most of its life in freshwater and migrates into estuaries upon maturation. The largest rainbow trout caught weighed close to 15 pounds and was 19 inches in lengths. Rainbow trout live in streams and are native to the North Pacific Ocean.  Char Arctic char in Alaska are closely related to both trout and salmon, but are heartier and can live in harsher conditions such as colder and deeper northern water. The Arctic char can weigh up to 20 pounds. Grayling The grayling, inhabit mountain lakes and still rivers. The grayling has a long dorsal fin that is multicolored, typically consisting of reds and aquas.  Halibut The Pacific halibut is the largest flatfish in the family Pleuronectidae. The halibut swims sideways due to its lateral flattening, and most adults have both eyes on their upward-facing side. The scales on the halibut are embedded into the skin, giving the illusion that the halibut is smooth. Lamprey The lamprey is an eel-like jawless vertebrate that is a part of the family Petromyzonidae. Lampreys are freshwater fish often found around coastal waters and burrow their larvae in such waters.  Lingcod The lingcod is a bottomfish and are commercially harvested. It is a large fish that can grow up to 5 feet and weigh up to 130 pounds by their maturation stage. Colors range from brown, grey, green, and blue, and they have dark and light spotting. The lingcod thrives in the depths of the ocean floor and are found in coastal regions and in the Bering Strait. Longnose sucker The longnose sucker is the sucker fish with the greatest statewide distribution. It can weigh up to 5 pounds and lives in cold water streams. The sides, head, and top of the longnose sucker range from dark green to slate black while the belly is often white or yellow.  Pacific herring The Pacific herring does not have any distinct markings, but are rather sleek and silver with a bluish green tint. Its scales on its underside create a slightly serrated effect. The Pacific herring is capable of growing up to 18 inches, but rarely grow past 9 inches. Black rockfish The black rockfish is a blackish grey fish with a large mouth, spinous dorsal fin, and dark stripes for its eyes to its gills. This fish can weigh up to 11 pounds and grow up to 27.6 inches by the time they reach adulthood.  Salmon shark The salmon shark is a small shark that can grow up to 8 feet. This shark is light grey with a white tail. The male salmon shark matures between 9‚Äì10 years while the female shark matures at around 10‚Äì11 years. Sculpin Sculpin are small, fresh or saltwater fish that rarely grow any longer than 7 inches. Their habitats range form headwater streams to slow and rocky streams to coastal saltwater areas. The sculpin are flattened and have wide fins to help them secure themselves to the bottom of water bodies in harsh conditions.  Walleye pollock The walleye pollack is a key species to Alaska's fisheries. The pollack is a cod, and is multicolored, ranging from brown, green, silver, and white. The walleye pollack can grow up to 3 and a half feet and weight up to 13.3 pounds. White sturgeon The white sturgeon is different from other fish because they do not have scales, but rather boney plates extending from its gill to tail called scutes instead. The white sturgeon is considered a bottom-feeder and rummages the sea floor for food. This fish is toothless and ingests through means of suction, and has tastebuds on the outside of its mouth. Marine macroinvertebrates Alaska has 3,708 recorded species of marine macroinvertebrates inhabiting the marine waters from the intertidal zone, the continental shelf, and upper continental slope to abyssal depths, from the Beaufort Sea at the Arctic border with Yukon, Canada; the eastern Chukchi Sea, the eastern Bering Sea, the Aleutian Islands to the western border with Russia; and the Gulf of Alaska to Dixon Entrance at the southern border with British Columbia. Among the more commonly encountered are various species of shrimp, crab, lobster, and sponge. Endangered species Alaska has one of the smallest endangered species lists of U.S. states. According to the Alaska Department of Fish & Game there are only 12 endangered species, nearly all marine.

This is the third book in the Dexter series, preceded by the 2004 novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter‚Äîwhich formed the basis of the Showtime television series Dexter‚Äîand Dearly Devoted Dexter, its 2005 sequel. Dexter in the Dark was released September 18, 2007, in the United States and October 3, 2007, in the United Kingdom. The book was originally scheduled to be released earlier in the year. The Season 1 DVD of the television series allows access to the first two chapters of Dexter in the Dark when viewed on a computer. Plot Dexter in the Dark original UK 2007 version. Dexter Morgan investigates a double homicide at the University of Miami campus, where 2 female students have been found burned & beheaded. Their heads are replaced by the ceramic heads of bulls. Something about this uncharacteristically frightens Dexter's \\"Dark Passenger\\" into silence, leaving him to solve the crime on his own. As a series of similar murders take place, members of a mysterious cult begin stalking Dexter, believing his Dark Passenger to be a threat to them. Dexter soon begins to question the Dark Passenger, as he slowly realizes that it's a true entity unto itself, possibly an offspring of the ancient god Moloch. While attempting to dispatch a killer who had been stalking him, Dexter becomes frightened & is unable to go through with the deed. He soon realizes that the Dark Passenger had given him an unusual amount of confidence & an almost supernatural awareness of the world around him; now that it's gone, he feels vulnerable for the first time in his life. Dexter begins to develop sadness & anger, emotions that were once suppressed by the Dark Passenger. While missing the helpful clues & hints of the Dark Passenger, Dexter feeds off of his newfound emotions to find some balance in his life & to solve the mystery unfolding around him. Meanwhile, traumatized by their abusive biological father, Dexter's soon-to-be stepchildren Astor & Cody Bennett have developed homicidal tendencies similar to his own. Dexter intends to teach them the \\"Code of Harry\\", which his adoptive father used to help him hide his dark nature, blend in with normal people, & channel his sociopathic urges to rid society of vile scum who deserve to die. Cody & Astor are eager to learn, but Dexter informs them that they aren't ready yet, & still have years of training left before they'll be able to inflict any real human suffering. The cult kidnaps Astor & Cody, thereby forcing Dexter to engage them head-on. However, the cult soon captures Dexter through a supernatural captivation of music. Though confined in a small storage closet, Dexter escapes & encounters an old man who's the current avatar of Moloch. Though Dexter is instantly humbled & frightened by Moloch, he continuously mocks the malignant spirit, which in turn entrances the trio & orders them to be sacrificed in a flaming pit. Dexter manages to snap out of his trance & opens fire on the cult members. Moloch takes Astor hostage & threatens to kill her, only for Cody to stab him in the back with his own ceremonial knife. Dexter laments that, due to having killed at such an early age, Cody's journey will now be more difficult. Weeks pass, & Dexter is left alone to accept life without his Dark Passenger. At his wedding to Rita Bennett, Dexter falls into a state of depression as he thinks about how painful his life is going to be in its banality. Just then, the Dark Passenger returns, brought on by Dexter's immense suffering, & Dexter is made whole again in the final paragraphs of the novel. Narrative device This is the first of Jeff Lindsay's \\"Dexter\\" series not narrated exclusively in the first-person point of view. Along with Dexter's first-person narration, the novel includes third person narration from two other points of view. One is a person called the Watcher, a member of the cult that follows and observes Dexter. The other is a mythical, godlike entity called \\"IT\\" (revealed to be Moloch) which has existed since the beginning of time and is similar in various ways to the Dark Passenger. IT takes great pleasure in entering creatures as a \\"passenger\\" and making them kill other creatures, and it works to create other murderous entities similar to itself, but soon turns against many of them, causing them to flee. IT and its offspring go to war, and IT prevails. Some of IT's remaining children stay in hiding, fearing IT's power.

Mansions were stage structures used in medieval theatre to represent specific locations, such as Heaven or Hell. The actors would move between these mansions as the play demanded. The acting area of the stage was called the platea, and mansions were placed around the platea. As the actors moved between the mansions, the platea would take on the scenic identity of each mansion. In England, pageant wagons were used for the cycle dramas to hold the mansion, the plateau, and a dressing area. These were used to move the scene from one audience to the next, unlike in the church where the mansions were stationary and both the performer and the congregation would move from mansion to mansion.  Sociohistorical context  After the fall of the Roman Empire, structured drama became practically nonexistent. Theatrical performances persisted in some small degree through local and travelling troupes of what would later be called minstrels. These minstrels, along with the monastery scholars, would carry the knowledge and tradition of the Roman Theatre until the revival of theatre in the Early Middle Ages, beginning around 500 C.E.Brockett, Oscar G., and Franklin J. Hildy. History of the Theatre. Foundation ed. Boston, MA: Pearson, 2007. 74. Print. As the church‚Äôs power grew, they attempted to absorb the pagan religions. In order to draw people in, while allowing them to keep a sense of their traditions, they superimposed Christian theology on pagan holiday celebrations. Easter was already the appropriate time of year to take the place of the spring fertility festivals. The Roman festivals celebrating the births of Dionysus, Osiris, and other lesser deities became Christmas, despite Christ‚Äôs birth never being celebrated in the winter before.Brockett, Oscar G., and Franklin J. Hildy. History of the Theatre. Foundation ed. Boston, MA: Pearson, 2007. 76. Print. To keep up with the elaborate and theatrical celebrations found in the pagan religions, the church began creating spectacle performances. For example, they might place a cross wrapped in burial clothes in a tomb on Good Friday and raise it on Sunday, or stage elaborate mystery plays such as the one the lasted multiple days in the town of Mons, France.Crabtree, Susan, and Peter Beudert. Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools, and Techniques. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2005. 367. Print. The processionals evolved into the liturgical dramas of the high Middle Ages. By 1300, the performance of liturgical dramas in churches was widespread across Western Europe, and so began the use of mansions and plateas, which persisted throughout the Middle Ages. In the 14th Century, the Church in England, in an attempt to continue to spark interest and devotion to the church, began to build movable mansions, called pageant wagons, to carry to different parts of town to create an elaborate travelling show. Carrying the performances out of the church, the play slowly became more secular. Audiences prized the comic characters such as lesser demons and drunks, and those who played them well, reigniting professionalism in performance. The use of mansions, and eventually pageant wagons helped to create an affirmation of faith in the church in the Middle Ages. Specific characteristics of mansions  In the earliest days of liturgical drama, plays were performed inside the church with limited scenery and the focus of the audience on the action.Brockett, Oscar G., and Franklin J. Hildy. History of the Theatre. Foundation ed. Boston, MA: Pearson, 2007. 80. Print. Mansions were used to indicate location but much of the performance took place on the platea, the open space in front of the scenic structure, with the actors moving from mansion to mansion only when strictly necessary. The increase in length of the plays and the inclusion of a wider variety of locations that needed to be represented by individual mansions was part of what caused the movement of performances from clergy control inside church spaces (where the mansions were nestled within structural arches or alcoves) to laity control outdoors in the streets or public squares. This movement to the outdoors resulted in two different methods of staging: in England, mansions were converted into pageant wagons, which could be wheeled along in a parade-like fashion from audience to audience, while in France and the rest of continental Europe, the stations were more commonly lined up in an open square, sometimes on a u-shaped or circular platform, and the actors would move from mansion to mansion. As time passed the plays came to be performed in the vernacular and required the involvement of community members, local guilds, and patronage from town government to produce the increasingly spectacular cycle, mystery, and morality plays. Mansions, either stationary or moveable, represented a wide variety of locations such as the House of Adam, the Temple, the Garden of Gethsemane, and Mount Olivet, and were often lavishly decorated to add to the spectacle of the performance. In the mystery play at Mons, France in 1501, five painters were hired to paint the 67 mansion stages with various pigments as well as varnish, gold leaf, and silver powder. They were also responsible for painting the backdrops, the furniture and other set pieces, and imitation draperies. It is likely that because of the limited amount of total stage space, many of the mansion stages doubled for one another or were changed in between scenes.Simonson, Lee. The Stage Is Set. Plainview, NY: for Libraries, 1975. Print. Flying machines, trapdoors, rope-and-pulley systems, and special effects such as a dragon that spit fire, light shining from the manger in the Nativity and torrential rain for the creation of the world were popular. Machinery or hidden sections such as Heaven would often be concealed with drapery or painted clouds, as was done in the Mons production. A great number of people were employed in the production of these mansions, from Jehan de Dours, cabinetmaker, paid 48 sols for ‚Äúmaking castles and turrets‚Äù, to Pierart Viscave, tinker, for installing sheets of metal to be used to create thunder effects, to Jehan du Fayt and seventeen assistants for working as stage hands for the nine-day performance.Simonson, Lee. The Stage Is Set. Plainview, NY: for Libraries, 1975. 176, 177, 181. Print. Both the production period and the performance of the outdoor vernacular medieval drama were extensive, with the 22 mansions for a production in Rouen prepared over 18 years. These medieval spectacles laid the foundation for the flourishing of drama in the Renaissance of later centuries.

An Oscar Friedheim card cutting and scoring machine from 1889 Card stock, also called cover stock and pasteboard, is paper that is thicker and more durable than normal writing and printing paper, but thinner and more flexible than other forms of paperboard. Card stock is often used for business cards, postcards, playing cards, catalogue covers, scrapbooking, and other applications requiring more durability than regular paper gives. The surface usually is smooth; it may be textured, metallic, or glossy. When card stock is labeled cover stock, it often has a glossy coating on one or both sides (C1S or C2S, for \\"coated: one side\\" or \\"coated: two sides\\"); this is used especially in business cards and book covers. Measurements Most nations describe paper in terms of grammage‚Äîthe weight in grams of one sheet of the paper measuring one square meter. Other people, especially in the United States, describe paper in terms of pound weight‚Äîthe weight in pounds of 500 sheets of the paper with a given area: for card stock, this is ; for text stock (thinner paper, as used for writing and in books); this is . In describing paper, the pound is often symbolized by the pound symbol, #. Because of the difference in the way text- and card-stock pound weight is determined, a sheet of 65# card stock is thicker and heavier than a sheet of 80# text. The weight of cardstock ranges from 50# to 110# (about 135 to 300 g/m2). Rather than as a function of weight per sheet of a given area, paper thickness can be measured and stated directly, in units of linear measure. In the United States, this usually is expressed in thousandths of an inch, often abbreviated thou points (pt. and pts.) and mils. For example, a 10 pt. card is thick (corresponding to a weight of about 250 g/m2), and 12 pt. is . The thou point (1/1,000 inch) differs from the typographical point (1/12 traditional pica = exactly 0.01383 inch = 0.35136 mm). The length and width of card stock often are stated in terms of the ISO system of paper sizes, in which specific dimensions are implied by numbers prefixed with the letter A. Card stock labeled A3, for example, measures 420 √ó 297 mm (16.5 √ó 11.7 in).

His work typically features elongated nude figures in intimate settings,Jack Salzman, Cornel West, Encyclopedia of African-American culture and history, Volume 2, Macmillan Library Reference, 1996, p. 663. influenced by both traditional African art and European surrealism.  Early life  Cortor was born in Richmond, Virginia, to John and Ophelia Cortor.Patricia Hills, Melissa Renn, Syncopated Rhythms: 20th-century African American art from the George and Joyce Wein collection, Boston University Art Gallery, 2005, p. 37. His family moved to Chicago when Cortor was about a year old, eventually settling in that city's South Side, where Cortor attended Englewood High School. Fellow students at Englewood included the African- American artists Charles Wilbert White and Margaret Burroughs.Stacy I. Morgan, Rethinking social realism: African American art and literature, 1930-1953, University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 50. Cortor attended the Art Institute of Chicago, along with artist Gus Nall, gaining a degree in 1936.David C. Driskell et al, The Other Side of Color: African American art in the collection of Camille O. and William H. Cosby, Jr, Pomegranate, 2001, p. 180. In 1940 he worked with the Works Progress Administration (WPA),Anderson Delano Macklin, A biographical history of African-American artists, A-Z, Edwin Mellen Press, 2001, p. 29. where he drew scenes of Depression-era Bronzeville, a neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. In 1949, he studied in Jamaica, Cuba, and Haiti on a Guggenheim Fellowship,\\"Nineteen Young Americans\\", Life Magazine, March 20, 1950. and taught at the Centre d'Art in Port-au-Prince from 1949 to 1951. Growing up, he was an avid reader of the Chicago Defender, which was a popular newspaper that focused on celebrating the successes of African Americans. This is ultimately translated into the main thematic focus of his artwork, which is to portray African Americans in a positive light and highlight their beauty and achievements. For the majority of his career, Cortor played with different representations of the black female figure and how to represent her strength and beauty. Cortor saw the black female figure as being the essential spirit of the black race. His style is often described as experimenting with black physiognomy while infusing it with surrealism.  Career In 1944 and in 1945, Cortor won two fellowships that allowed him to travel to the Sea Islands off the coast of Georgia and South Carolina. The Gullah people resided in these islands and Cortor was particularly interested in this area because of how untouched their culture had been by white people and American culture. In this regard, Cortor decided to explore a different African diasporic culture that had more African elements prevalent overall in their culture. He spent two years living on the islands and immersed himself into the Gullah culture. \\"As a Negro artist I have been particularly concerned with painting Negro racial types not only as such but in connection with particular problems in color, design and composition‚Ä¶I have felt an especial interest in‚Ä¶painting Negroes whose cultural traditions had been only slightly influenced by whites‚Ä¶I should like to‚Ä¶paint a series of pictures which would reflect the particular physical and racial characteristics of the Gullahs.\\"  Death  Cortor died on November 26, 2015, at the age of 99. Works Eldzier Cortor (1959) Studying the African sculptures at an exhibit at the Field Museum transformed his work.Lisa Gail Collins, The Art of History: African American women artists engage the past, Springer Science & Business, 2002, p. 140. He said \\"That was the most important influence in all my work, for to this day you will find in my handling of the human figure that clylindrical and lyrical quality I was taught...to appreciate in African art.\\"Elton C. Fax, Seventeen Black Artists, Dood, Mead, 1971, p. 87. Cortor was one of the first African-American artists to make African-American women his dominant theme,Romare Bearden, Harry Brinton Henderson, A History of African-American artists: from 1792 to the present, Pantheon Books, 1993, p. 272. explaining, \\"the Black woman represents the Black race, continuance of life.\\"Sharon F. Patton, African-American Art, Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 164. His treatment of women has been criticised, for instance in a 1985 article in Art, which described the figure in Southern Gate (1942‚Äì43) as, \\"Stripped of integrity and reduced to a mere object‚Ä¶\\"Art 1985: 80. According to Adrienne Childs, Cortor‚Äôs Cuban Souvenir \\"presents an exoticized black woman whose red dress, red lips‚Ä¶evoke the stereotypical notion of the Latin female sexuality.\\" (Childs 1998: 122). Mel Edwards mentions Cortor as an example of an African- American artist influenced by surrealism, \\"who often uses the female figure in a surreal interior and exterior environment.\\" Cortor is considered to be the first African American artists to depict nude women as the central theme of his work. This was an unpopular choice for many artists at the time as a reaction to the dominant European and American cultural landscape at the time (Farrington 2004: 20). This was also unfavored because of the historical legacy of the sexual exploitation of black women during slavery. Cortor refutes these notions by showing the nude black female body as a source of strength. Cortor also believed that the black woman conveys a sense of eternity and continuance of life (Jennings 1988:, 47). An example of this is Cortor‚Äôs famous painting named Southern Gate, which is illustrated in Figure 2. The central figure to this painting is a young, naked black woman. The background of the painting is very dark; the gate is in ruins and the clouds are indicative of a storm. Immediately behind the woman, there are less clouds and more light, which illuminates her figure. The woman also has a flower in her hair and a bird on her shoulder, perhaps indicating the dawn of a new day. The figure in the painting stands stall, giving an overall sense of a triumphant figure still standing throughout the crumbling ruins and the resilience of black women in general (Dallow 2004:98). Starting in the 1950s, Cortor became further inspired by African sculptures. In these works, one can see that he works more with cylindrical, graceful and elongated limbs. This is evident through Cortor‚Äôs painting Dance Composition No. 31, which was produced in 1978 as a part of a series. It is seen as a reflection of his time that he spent with the Gullah people. In this painting, he evokes basketry and dance, which were two activities considered essential to the Gullah people. The swirling lines and the subtle incorporation of vibrant colors implies a sense of visual movement of the dancers (Bearden 1993: 57). The women‚Äôs faces‚Äô are depicted like sculptures, giving them a marble feel within the painting, referencing African art along with the decorative patterning. The sculptural women are also conveyed with a sense of peacefulness. This shows how important basket weaving and dancing are to the Gullah people and their culture. Another example of this subtle shift in Cortor‚Äôs work is a painting of his named Classical Study No. 34 which was created in 1968 and also a part of a different series. In this painting, the woman is resting her head on her hand in a profile representation. Cortor plays with her features and makes them rather elongated, which gives a sculptural feel to the subject. She is also wearing a red, yellow and green scarf which is symbolic of the Pan-African flag, which pays homage to her African roots. The figure also resembles ancient marble sculptures, which were used in the past to celebrate someone. This painting is representative of celebrating the beauty and strength of black women, while emphasizing her African roots. Exhibitions and collections Cortor exhibited in the 1938 interracial show \\"An Exhibition in Defense of Peace and Democracy\\", which was sponsored by the Chicago Artists' Group.Stacy I. Morgan, Rethinking social realism: African American art and literature, 1930-1953, University of Georgia Press, 2004, . .
