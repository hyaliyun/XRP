Career and research In the late 1990s together with Nathan Strange of JPL, he developed the method and coined the term, the ‚ÄúTisserand graph,‚Äù widely used for gravity-assist spacecraft trajectory design (a concept independently introduced by Labunsky et al.). He also developed the technique and coined the term, ‚ÄúV-Infinity Leveraging,‚Äù which uses a deep space maneuver to leverage (increase or decrease) the hyperbolic velocity at the next gravity-assist body. Longuski began work on Mars cycler trajectories in 1985 when Buzz Aldrin visited JPL looking for verification of his proposed trajectory now known as the Aldrin cycler. The concept involves placing a large spacecraft (or astronaut hotel) in orbit around the Sun that continually flies by Mars and Earth , providing a permanent human transportation system between those planets. Longuski was able to verify Aldrin's concept and together they developed several versions of cycler trajectories. In 2001, Longuski with Ephraim Fischbach and Daniel Scheeres proposed a test of Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity based on spacecraft trajectories .

The Newark site operated from 1983 to July 1990, selling small amounts of chemicals. Some of the chemicals sold there were Trichloroethylene and 1-2-Dichloroethane. These chemicals were being improperly stored and leaked into the soil and groundwater. The EPA placed the property on the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1991, declaring it a Superfund site.  Origins  The White Chemical Corporation Superfund site is a 4.4-acre vacant lot located at 660 Frelinghuysen Avenue in Newark, New Jersey.  Health hazard  Chemicals were improperly stored on-site in containers that were leaking into soil and groundwater. Some of these chemicals, such as Trichloroethylene, are carcinogenic. Another chemical identified at the site was 1-2-Dichloroethane, which is a probable carcinogenic in humans.  Superfund designation  The EPA found over 10,000 55-gallon drums as well as other containers that were improperly storing hazardous materials. The storage containers were degrading, leaking or fuming their contents into the surrounding environment. The EPA also found 150 gas cylinders, 126 storage tanks, and additional containers on-site. In addition to the improperly stored materials in drums, there were approximately 12,000 laboratory-sized containers being used to improperly store materials on-site. The carcinogenic substances that were stored in the containers were found in the soil and groundwater of Newark. The discovery of these improperly stored hazardous substances led to the site being declared a Superfund site.  Cleanup  Immediately after discovery of the improper containers, the EPA and state of New Jersey began a surface contamination cleanup where they removed over 1,000 contaminated drums, vats, tanks, laboratory-size containers and other vessels from 1990 to April 1993. Next, the EPA began the demolition of on-site buildings and the remediation of on-site soil. The EPA dug out and disposed of 21,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil and demolished every building by April 2009. They filled the vacant soil plot with new fresh soil and the land was regraded . The last phase of cleanup (groundwater contamination) seems to be the most difficult. It would be easy for the EPA to simply dig out the contaminated groundwater and treat it as is. This method of cleanup is as EPA official Elias Rodriguez states ‚Äúnot technically feasible...because of the complex rock formations underlying the site.‚Äù He states that the EPA has come to the conclusion that ‚Äúthe plan requires bioremediation, the injection of chemicals into the groundwater to promote the breakdown of the pollutants‚Äù. Once the bioremedy is in effect, the EPA approximates the groundwater will receive several rounds of chemical injections throughout the course of years to ensure the water is treated properly. Monitoring wells will also be constructed to take samples of the groundwater and prove that it is no longer contaminated. Currently, the site is awaiting funding from the EPA so it can begin bioremediation.

The church is the only surviving Middle Byzantine katholikon (monastery church) in Cyprus during the 11th century and is not mentioned until the 13th century in surviving texts. St. Nicholas of the Roof prospered from the Middle Byzantine era until the beginning of Frankish rule, around the 12th century. Since Frankish rule the church remained open, but served as a small village church and a pilgrimage site. The church is one of the nine Painted Churches in the Tro√∂dos Region, which was labeled as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985.  Architectural Context of Cyprus  Birth of Christ Architectural Scholar, Charles Anthony Stweart describes early- Christian churches in his article, The First Vaulted Churches in Cyprus: \\"All sixty-five known Early Christian churches, dating from the late fourth to mid-seventh century, display the same traits: they have at least three aisles divided by colonnades supporting wood roofs. In this period there are no centrally planned, domed, or vaulted buildings. The conservative nature of Cypriot church building can be explained by the insular character of the Church...The Cypriot Church could maintain its own internal appointments and customs. Because of its independent and powerful hierarchical system, heresies such as Arianism and Monophysitism did not affect Cyprus as they did other Byzantine provinces\\" (Stewart 162-163). Author Annemarie Weyl Carr continues to depict early Cyrus churches in her journal, Byzantines and Italians on Cyprus: Images from Art: \\"The Western presence in medieval Cyprus presents itself today and has been studied largely in terms of the island's opulent Gothic architecture, rising amid minarets and palm trees in the Mediterranean sun. Astonishingly romantic, these building invoke an image of French courtly culture transposed to the Middle East\\" (Weyl 340). George and Theodor The architecture of The Church of St. Nicholas of the Roof is a domed cross-in square plan and gets its name from the second timber roof with flat tiles. Originally, there was no narthex or timber roof, which covers both the nave and the narthex. At the beginning of the 12th century the narthex covered by a calotte and two traverse arches was added. This addition of a steep-pitched roof gave Agios Nikolaos the nickname 'of the Roof' ('tis Stegis'). Author A. H. S. Megaw comments on the addition of the later roof, \\"This later roof conceals a perfectly normal church of the Byzantine inscribed-cross type, complete with a dome...These step-pitched roofs would then represent the indigenous \\"provincial,\\" architecture of this area of Cyprus, which was temporarily supplanted by alien Byzantine domes\\" (Megaw 81 & 88). At a later stage the church's original appearance was altered resulting in the destruction of some interior paintings.  Interior Decoration  Nikolaus The interior walls of the church are adorned with a series of frescoes ranging over 600 years. The first phase of decoration began in the 11th century and survived the later raids and general deterioration due to time. Again, author A. H. S. Megaw comments on the decoration of the church, \\"what remains of its initial fresco decoration is not of the first class, it is still a reflection, if a somewhat remote one, of the central tradition of Constantinople. In heads such as those of the apostles in scenes and that of the Gabriel lately uncovered in the apse we see the deep-set staring eyes of the expressionist style which fresco painters of the time inherited from Byzantine miniaturists of the Macedonian renaissance\\" (Megaw 82). The murals depict scenes from the life of Jesus, the Raising of Lazarus, the Dormition of the Virgin Mary, and some isolated figures. The second phase of decoration has been dated back to the 12th century and includes wall-paintings from the southwest part of the church and the narthex. Author, Megaw explains, \\"Much of St. Nicholas of the Roof was redecorated in the 12th century with more sophisticated paintings, among them the usual series of Church Fathers on the apse wall which in this case includes a characteristic representation of St. Epiphanius. Naturally he figures frequently among the Fathers in Cypriot apses. We will see more of this Comneniam style which in Cyprus is explicable only in the injection of new talent in the shape of masters who had been trained outside the Island, some of them perhaps in Constantinople itself\\" (Megaw 82). Although some wall paintings from the 11th and 12th century survive, most of the mural decoration of the church is dated to the 14th century. The murals of The Crucifixion and the Resurrection were painted in the late 13th century to the beginning of the 14th century. The image of Christ Pantocrator adorns the dome along with prophets on the drum of the dome and the evangelists on the four pendentives. These three works are dated to the mid 14th century. In the nave and the narthex there is a group of life size saints dated to the same period. On the northwest pier, there are two massive images of St. Theodore and St. George.

The case was an influential decision concerning the construction of Section 44 of the Constitution and the meaning of \\"indirect pecuniary interest\\" in an agreement with the Commonwealth. The High Court held that Bob Day's re-election to the Senate in July 2016 was invalid, since he'd had an \\"indirect pecuniary interest\\" in an agreement with the Commonwealth since at least February 2016. As a result, he had not been eligible to sit as a Senator from at least February 2016 onward by reason of section 44(v) of the Constitution. Background Day ran as a Family First Party South Australia Senate candidate at the 2013 federal election and was successful. On 1 November 2016, Day announced he had tendered his resignation to the President of the Australian Senate, with immediate effect, following the liquidation of Home Australia Group, a building company founded and managed by Day. Constitutional validity of election Shortly after Day's resignation, the government announced that it would move in the Senate to refer to the High Court the matter of the validity of Day's election in July 2016 in regard to a possible breach of section 44(v) of the Constitution, which provides that a person who \\"has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth\\" (and s 44 continues) \\"shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting\\" as a member of either house of the Parliamentand it follows that they are ineligible to be nominated for election to either house. The basis of the complaint was that, at Day's request, his Commonwealth-funded electorate office was by lease of part of a building in Adelaide that he indirectly owned, so that the Commonwealth's payments of rent would eventually come into a bank account of his own. Judgment The High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, held a preliminary hearing before Gordon J, whose judgment delivered on 27 January 2017 made numerous findings of fact.. (Gordon J). The case was heard on 7 February by a full court of the High Court, which delivered its judgment on 5 April. The Court found that, since 26 February 2016 (although three judges were prepared to say 1 December 2015), Day had had an \\"indirect pecuniary interest\\" in an agreement with the Commonwealth, and thus was in violation of section 44(v). This was despite the fact that Commonwealth public servants, perceiving a conflict with section 44(v), had not made any payments of rent; Day's \\"interest\\" was constituted by his arranged entitlement to receive monies from any rent that was paid. Consequently, the Court found that Day was ineligible to serve in the Senate as of 26 February 2016, and he was therefore ineligible to nominate for the federal election of 2 July 2016. The Court declared Day's seat vacant and ordered that a special recount of South Australian ballot papers be held to determine his replacement, which the Court envisaged would be the other person on the Family First list in that election, Lucy Gichuhi. Aftermath The Australian Labor Party lodged a challenge, claiming that Gichuhi might still be a citizen of Kenya, hence ineligible under Constitution section 44(i) as a citizen of a \\"foreign power\\". On 19 April 2017 a full court of the High Court,The court consisted of Justice Gordon, who had been deputed to approve the recount, and Justice Nettle; two Justices are the minimum necessary to constitute a full court of the High Court: . found that the objection had not been made out and declared Gichuhi elected..

All orchids are myco- heterotrophic at some point in their life cycle. Orchid mycorrhizae are critically important during orchid germination, as an orchid seed has virtually no energy reserve and obtains its carbon from the fungal symbiont. The symbiosis starts with a structure called a protocorm. During the symbiosis, the fungus develops structures called pelotons within the root cortex of the orchid. Many adult orchids retain their fungal symbionts throughout their life, although the benefits to the adult photosynthetic orchid and the fungus remain largely unexplained. Seed germination  Orchid protocorm Orchids have several life stages. The first stage is the non- germinated orchid seed, the next stage is the protocorm, and the following stage is the adult orchid. Orchid seeds are very small (0.35mm to 1.50mm long), spindle-shaped, and have an opening at the pointed end. Each seed has an embryo that is undifferentiated and lacks root and shoot meristems. An orchid seed does not have enough nutritional support to grow on its own. Instead, it gets nutrients needed for germination from fungal symbionts in natural settings. When the orchid seeds germinate they form intermediate structures called protocorms, young plants which have germinated but lack leaves and which consist mainly of parenchyma cells. Infected protocorms tend to develop an active meristem within a few days. In the adult stage, many orchids have a small amount of thick unbranched roots which results in a root system with a small surface area that is favorable to potentially mycotrophic tissue. Orchids lacking chlorophyll, called achlorophyllous mycoheterotrophs, will retain their fungal symbionts their entire lives, relying on the fungus for carbon. The debate over whether fungal symbiosis is necessary for the orchid is an old one, as Noel Bernard first proposed orchid symbiosis in 1899. In 1922 the American botanist Lewis Knudson discovered that orchid seeds could be grown on agar and fungal sugars without mycorrhizae, however modern research has found that the germination of orchids may be more successful with specific fungi. Although epiphytic orchids grow on other plants they may produce chlorophyll in their leaves, stems, and roots. As with all orchids, germination and the develop into protocorms is reliant upon fungal symbionts, which decrease the time of germination and increase the vigor of the protocorm. The reliance of orchids on specific fungi has been widely studied, and the populations of certain fungi which are present in the soil have proved to be of greater importance in seed germination than the orchid's proximity to older plants or their geographical location, as previously assumed.  Fungal entry into orchid  Orchid mycorrhizal fungus from Zambia on agar plate, Jodrell Laboratory, Kew Gardens Mutualistic fungi can enter at various orchid life stages. Fungal hyphae can penetrate the parenchyma cells of germinated orchid seeds, protocorms, late-staged seedlings, or adult plant roots. The fungal hyphae that enter the orchid have many mitochondria and few vacuoles., thus increasing their metabolic capacity when paired with an accepting symbiote. In the protocorm stage hyphae enter the chalazal (top) end of the embryo, however in terrestrial orchids fungal entry into adult plant roots happens mainly through root hair tips which then take on a distorted shape. The symbiosis is typcally maintained throughout the lifetime of the orchid because they depend on the fungus for nutrients, sugars and minerals. However, some orchids have been found to switch fungal partners during extreme conditions.  Fungal pelotons and orchid root cortex  Shortly after the fungus enters an orchid, the fungus produces intracellular hyphal coils called pelotons in the embryos of developing seedlings and the roots of adult plants. The formation of pelotons in root cortical cells is a defining anatomical structure in orchid mycorrhiza that differentiate it from other forms of fungi. The pelotons can range in size and in the arraignment and density packaging of their hyphae. Pelotons are separated from the orchid's cytoplasm by an interfacial matrix and the orchid's plasma membrane. The material that makes up the interfacial matrix can differ depending on the orchid mychorrizal stage of interaction. Orchid cells with degenerating pelotons lack starch grains, whereas the newly invaded orchid cells contain large starch grains, suggesting the hydrolysis of starch resulting from the fungal colonization. There is an enlargement of the nucleus in infected orchid cortical cells and in non-infected cortical cells near an infected area as a result of increased DNA content. The increased DNA content has been correlated with the differentiation of parenchymal cells suggesting its role in orchid growth. As pelotons of live fungal hyphae age and are eventually disintegrated, or lysed, they appear as brown or yellow clumps in the orchid cells. The disintegrated pelotons are an area of considerable interest in current research. The disintegrated pelotons first experience a collapse where orchid microtubules surround the pelotons, which may be the mechanism behind the peloton collapse by producing physiological and structural changes of the hyphae. The cortical cells of older roots tend to have more lysed pelotons than young pelotons. Although pelotons are lysed, new pelotons continue to be formed, which indicates a high amount of new hyphal activity.  Fungi forming orchid mycorrhizae  Basidiomycetous Rhizoctonia Fungi The fungi that form orchid mycorrhizae are typically basidiomycetes. These fungi come from a range of taxa including Ceratobasidium (Rhizoctonia), Sebacina, Tulasnella and Russula species. Most orchids associate with saprotrophic or pathogenic fungi, while a few associate with ectomycorrhizal fungal species. These latter associations are often called tripartite associations as they involve the orchid, the ectomycorrhizal fungus and its photosynthetic host plant. Some of the challenges in determining host-specificity in orchid mycorrhizae have been the methods of identifying the orchid-specific fungi from other free living fungal species in wild-sourced samples. Even with modern molecular analysis and genomic databases, this can still prove difficult, partially due to the difficulty in culturing fungi from protocorms and identification of fungal samples, as well as changes in evolving rDNA. However it has become clearer that different fungi may associate with orchids at specific stages, whether at germination, protocorm development, or throughout the orchid's life. The types of orchids and their symbiotic fungi also vary depending on the environmental niches they occupy, whether terrestrial or growing on other plants as an epiphyte. Ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycota A number of other basidiomycetous fungi have been documented in various orchids that do not fall under the Rhizoctonia umbrella. In particular, many fully mycoheterotrophic orchids associate with ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes belonging to genera such as Thelephora, Tomentella and Russula. Basidiomycetes of the Atractiellales Ascomycota Though rare in orchids, ascomycete associations have been documented in several orchid species. The European terrestrial orchid Epipactis helleborine has a specific association with ectomycorrhizal ascomycetes in the Tuberaceae.  Orchid mycorrhiza nutrient transport  Orchids mycorrhiza (OM) are found in approximately 10% of the botanical diversity of earth and have unique and specialized mycorrhizal nutrient transfer interactions which define the fitness and diversity of the orchid family. Orchid mycorrhizal associations involve a plethora of distinctive nutrient transport systems, structures and phenomenon which have only been observed in the family Orchidaceae. These interactions are formed between basidiomycete fungi and all Orchidaceae species. The basidiomycete fungi most commonly found associated with orchids, rhizoctonia, are known for their saprophytic abilities making this fungi orchid association anomalous, allowing both the plant and fungi to access a source of carbon within the mycorrhizal association not available in arbuscular mycorrhiza. The way and degree to which different orchid species exploit these interactions varies. Orchid mycorrhizal interactions can range from wholly parasitic on the fungal partner, to a mutualistic interaction involving bidirectional nutrient transfer between the plant and mycorrhizal fungus. Orchid plants have an obligatory parasitic life stage at germination where all of their nutrients must be supplied by a fungus. After germination, the orchid mycorrhizal interactions will become specialized to utilize the carbon and nutrients available in the environment surrounding the interaction. These associations are often thought to be dictated by the plant. It has been indicated in past studies that orchid plant individuals which inhabit dense highly shaded forests may depend significantly more on their fungal partner for carbon, varying within and between species, demonstrating the variable and reactive nature of these interaction.  Nutrient transfer interfaces and mechanisms  At infection of an orchid by a mycorrhizal fungus both partners are altered considerably to allow for nutrient transfer and symbiosis. Nutrient transfer mechanisms and the symbiotic mycorrhizal peloton organs start to appear only shortly after infection around 20‚Äì36 hours after initial contact. There is significant genetic upregulation and downregulation of many different genes to facilitate the creation of the symbiotic organ, and the pathways with which nutrients travel. As the fungus enters the parenchyma cells of the orchid the plasma membrane invaginates to facilitate fungal infection and growth. This newly invaginated plasma membrane surrounds the growing pelotons and creates a huge surface area from which nutrients can be exchanged. The pelotons of orchid mycorrhiza are intensely coiled dense fungal hyphae that are often more extensive in comparison to endomycorrhizal structures of arbuscular mycorrhiza. The surrounding plant membrane essentially becomes rough endoplasmic reticulum with high amounts of ribosomes and a plethora of transporter proteins, and aquaporins. Additionally there is evidence from electron microscopy that indicates the occurrence of exocytosis from the plant membrane. This highly convoluted and transporter rich membrane expertly performs the duties of nutrient exchange between the plant and fungus and allows for molecular manipulation by ribosomes and excreted enzymes within the interfacial apoplast. Pelotons are not permanent structures and are readily degraded and digested within 30 to 40 hours of their formation in orchid mycorrhiza. This happens in all endomycorrhizal associations but orchid plants readily digest fungal pelotons sooner after formation and more often than is seen in arbuscular mycorrhizal interactions. It is proposed that the occurrence of this more extreme digestive pattern may have something to do with necrotorphic nutrient transfer which is the absorption of nutrients form dead cells. The key nutrients involved in the majority of the transfer between fungi and orchid plants are carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Orchid mycorrhizal interactions are unique in the flow of nutrients. Typically in arbuscular mycorrhizal interactions the plants will unidirectionally supply the fungi with carbon in exchange for phosphorus or nitrogen or both depending on the environment, but orchid mycorrhizal nutrient transfer is less specific (but no less regulated) and there is often bidirectional flow of carbon between the fungus and plant, as well as flow of nitrogen and phosphorus from the fungus to plant. In around 400 species of plants there is no flow of carbon from plant and all of the nutrients of the plant are supplied by the fungus. However, the net carbon gain by the plant in these interactions is positive in majority of the observed interactions.  Phosphorus transport  Phosphorus is a crucial nutrient needed by all plants and often phosphorus deficiency in soil will dictate the formation of a symbiotic relationship. Phosphorus is obtained by the mycorrhizal fungus from the surrounding soil in three different forms; organic phosphorus, phosphate, and inorganic phosphorus compounds. Often, these compounds are strongly bound to cations and need to be protonated and, or catabolized to become bioavailable. Mycorrhizal fungi are extremely efficient at doing this due to their extensive soil surface area as well as high enzymatic diversity. Once freed from the soil the phosphorus compounds, primarily inorganic phosphate, are transferred through two proposed pathways. The first involves the active transport of inorganic phosphorus, primarily as phosphate through Pi(inorganic phosphorus) transporters out of the fungus into the interfacial apoplast, where it is protonated due to the acidic nature of the interfacial apoplast to form dihydrogen phosphate and then subsequently transferred through active Pi transporters into the plant cell. The second method relies on passive efflux of Pi from the fungus and active uptake by the plant, as in the prior pathway. It is observed that free living fungi ordinarily have very slight losses of Pi, thought to be due to the re-absorptive nature of the fungal hyphae, but it is proposed that during symbiosis the reabsorption of Pi is reduced thus increasing the net efflux out of the fungi. Both pathways depend on relatively high concentrations of Pi in the fungal cells and low Pi concentrations inside the plant cell for efficient transport, although the second method is far more dependent on this condition. Additionally these methods are not mutually exclusive and may occur in the same individuals, but more research is required to uncover the complexities of the interaction. To facilitate phosphorus exchange an array of genes are upregulated; Pi transporter genes such as MtPT4 and StPT3 are up regulated in orchids plants along with H+ ATPase transporters. Fungal partners upregulated Pi transporter genes as well as alkaline phosphatase encoding genes (Perotto). The upregulation of phosphatase genes is significant in that it indicates that a significant portion of the phosphorus obtained by the fungi in some environments may be from organic molecule catabolism. It is important to note that once a mycorrhizal symbiosis is established the only phosphorus obtained by the plant comes through the fungal tissue. Additionally the large scale assisted transport of phosphorus from fungi to plant only occurs when the fungal pelotons are alive, once these structures start to degrade significant flow of phosphorus ceases. This classifies this pathway as biotrophic, meaning transfer of nutrients between two or more organisms that are both alive.  Nitrogen transport  Nitrogen transport is an equally important and influential process that often occurs through mycorrhizal associations. Nitrogen is significantly easier to obtain than phosphorus and far more abundant, but mycorrhizal interactions still provide a significant benefit in the allocation of nitrogen. Bioavailable nitrogen as nitrate and ammonium are absorbed from the soil media into the extraradical mycelium of the mycorrhizal fungi and assimilated into amino acids. In some cases amino acids and other nitrogenous organic compounds may be present in the surrounding soil. If so organic nitrogen uptake also takes place through amino acid permeases and peptide transporters. Once incorporated into the fungi as amino acids, there are a few different proposed mechanisms with which the nitrogen is transferred to the host plant. These pathways of nitrogen transfer are thought to be exclusively biotrophic, a significant amount of nitrogen may also be transferred necrotorphically but through a significantly different process. In the first pathway the amino acids are transferred to the extraradical mycelium where the amino acids are broken down by the catabolic stage of the urea cycle. The primary amino acid synthesized and intra-fungally transferred is arginine, which is catabolized into ammonium. The ammonium is then shunted into the interfacial space between the peloton and the surrounding plant membrane,and transported into the plant cell via ammonium transporters and incorporated into the plant. To accommodate the transport of nitrogen via this pathway, primarily as ammonium, an array of ammonium transporter genes are up regulated in the plant partners, and additionally the mycorrhizal fungal partners often upregulate a group of protease genes as well as external amino acid permeases, nitrate transporters and ammonium transporters. As proposed by Cameron 2006 and Fochi 2016, nitrogen may also be transferred as amino acids such as arginine, glycine and glutamine into the cell via a select few specialized amino acid transporters. When in symbiotic relationship with orchid plants the mycorrhizal fungus T. calospora upregulates the expression of SvAAP1 and SvAAP2, these genes encode amino acid permeases, supporting the hypothesis that amino acids are an important molecule involved in nitrogen transport. Amino acids contain a significant amount of carbon as well and the transport of carbon may be the primary driving cause of the observed upregulation of the amino acid transporter genes, nonetheless nitrogen can still be transported to the plant via this pathway. The transport of inorganic nitrogen in the form of ammonium and the transport of organic nitrogen as amino acids most likely will occur simultaneously in the same species and or organism, depending on the abundance of different nitrogenous species in the soil, Fochi 2016 along with Dearnaley 2007 suggest that amino acids may in fact be the primary nitrogen compound transferred to orchids, evidence for this coming from isotopic ratios of enriched C13 and N15 within plants associated with mycorrhizal fungi, but more research is needed to fully understand this transport relationship.  Carbon transport  Apart from the unique peloton structures which transfer nitrogen and phosphorus from mycorrhizal fungi to orchid plants the transfer of these nutrients, as discussed above is almost identical to that observed in arbuscular mycorrhiza and ericoid mycorrhiza, but when it comes to arguably the most fundamental element involved in mycorrhizal transport carbon, orchid mycorrhiza show a distinct divergence form the traditional paradigm of unidirectional nutrient transfer in mycorrhizal associations. Orchid mycorrhizal interactions encompass a large variety of symbiotic scenarios, ranging from fully mycoheterotrophic plants or in other words parasitic on their fungal inhabitant such as Monotropa uniflora which lacks chlorophyll, to interactions that take on a similar nature to those found in arbuscular mycorrhiza, where in bidirectional nutrient transport takes place such as in green leaved Goodyera repens. For the documented interactions in orchid mycorrhiza it has been observed that even in photosynthetically capable species carbon will readily flow from fungi to the plant. This may or may not occur simultaneously with the transfer of carbon from plant to fungi. The evolutionary reasoning for this phenomenon is yet to be deduced. Due to this orchid mycorrhiza in general are considered at least partially mycoheterotrophic interactions. In the mycoheterotrophic orchid mycorrhiza carbon is taken up, by the fungi, as an array of peptide and carbohydrate species often the products of saprophytic reactions taking place in the soil. These reactions are often instigated and progressed by the activity of the mycorrhizal fungus, being part of the basidiomycete phyla, orchid associated fungi have an extensive metabolic arsenal with which to pull from, and are readily able to digest cellulose and lignin to obtain the carbon. Genes encoding proteases, cellulose and lignin digestive enzymes, as well as oligopeptide and carbohydrate transporters are upregulated in the mycelial soil webs to facilitate increased carbon uptake. Further more the fungi which mycoheterotrophically interact with orchid plants are often also found in mycorrhizal association with beech trees, and translocation of photosynthate from tree to fungus and then to orchid has been proposed, but a thorough study is still lacking. Once acquired by the fungus the carbon is either converted into sugars, trehalose being extremely common for most mycorrhizal fungus, amino acids, or simply assimilated into the fungal organism. The transfer of carbon from fungi to plant happens in one of two forms either as carbohydrates primarily trehalose, but glucose and sucrose may also be involved, or as an amino acids primarily as arginine but glycine and glutamine can also be transferred. These molecules are transported, via specialized amino acid permeases and carbohydrate transporters embedded in the fungal peloton membrane, into the interficial space where they are absorbed into the plant through similar analogous transporters in the plant endoplasmic reticulum membrane which surrounds the peloton. Genes which encode for such transporters experience significant upregulation in both plant and fungi, similar to the upregulation seen in nitrogen and phosphorus compound transporter genes during symbiosis. This active transport of carbon from fungi to plant is an exclusively biotorphic reaction but it is thought that a significant amount of carbon may also be transferred to the plant when the fungal pelotons degrade and are digested.  Mycophagy (necrotrophy)  The transfer of nitrogen and carbon as discussed above readily occurs through live pelotons, but it has been observed by Kuga 2014 and Rasumussen 2009 that large amount of carbon and nitrogen may also be taken up by the plant during the senescence and digestion of fungal pelotons. This process is called mycophagy. Lysis of pelotons begins between 30 and 40 hours after contact and initial peloton formation within the majority of observed orchid plants. As mentioned above as pelotons are formed they are covered by a plant derived membrane, which eventually takes on the properties of endoplasmic reticulum surrounded by Golgi apparatuses. The presence of these organelles is indicative of their purpose, which is thought to be the excretion of digestive enzymes into the interficial space between the peloton and the plant membrane to digest the fungal cells. Once the fate of the peloton is decided, and degradation and digestion are to occur, a secondary membrane forms around the fungal peloton which is essentially a large vacuole which will allow the isolated degradation of the peloton. Additionally peroxisomes accumulate within the digestive plant cells and undergo exosytosis into the newly formed vacuole, this process concentrates a plethora of enzymes such as uricases, chitinases, peptidases, oxidases and catalses within the vacuole facilitating the breakdown of the peloton. Once degraded the fungal remnants are absorbed into the plant, transferring the nutrients and energy to the plant host. Stable isotope imaging reveals that C13 and N15 applied to mycorrhizal hyphea webs was found to be readily transferred to the plant via fungal pelotons, leading to a disproportionate amount of these isotopes within the peloton containing plant cells and the peloton itself, but in senescencing pelotons the concentrations of these C13 and N15 containing compound was even more pronounced, and significantly higher than in live pelotons. This indicates that as plant pelotons start to senescence they are loaded with carbon and nitrogen nutritive compounds, hypothetically to be transferred to the plant during lysis. Morphological changes in the hyphea further support this proposition, in that the last morphological change in the peloton before is collapses is a swelling, perhaps due to the increased nutritive compound load. Once digestion is complete, reinfection of the digestive cell will occur shortly after and a new peloton will form, and eventually will be degraded. Reinfection and digestion are a continuum and will cyclically occur throughout the entire life span of the cooperation. Rasmussen 2009 differentiates two types of plant host cells which are involved in nutrient transfer, so called 'digestion cells' and so called 'host cells', 'digestive cells' apparently engage in dense hyphal peloton formation followed by a rapid digestion and subsequent reinfection, where as 'host cells' contain live hyphae pelotons, which will not be digested, or at least not as readily. Rasmussen 2002 discusses an additional mode of nutrient transfer called pytophagy involving lysis of fungal cells but instead of lysing the entire fungal hyphae only the growing end is degraded releasing the contents of the fungal cytoplasm into the interfacial space between the plant and fungi membranes, where the plant can uptake the necessary compounds. There is little information on this mode of nutrient transfer and it is still speculative, and more research is needed.  Micro- nutrient transfer  Micro-nutrient transfer is thought, for the most part, to occur by passive transport across cellular membranes, both during absorption, from soil by fungi, and transfer from fungi to host plants. This is not always the case though and although research on the topic is limited, there is evidence of active transport and allocation of micro-nutrients in certain conditions. The upregulation of cation transporters is observed in orchid D. officinale symbioses, suggesting fungi may assisted in the transfer of nutrients from fungi to plant. Cations, especially iron, are often bound tightly to organic and clay substrates keeping them out of reach of plants, fungi and bacteria, but compounds such as siderophores are often secreted into the soil by fungi and bacteria to aid in the acquisition of these cations. A siderophore is a small molecule which has extremely high affinity for Fe3+ and is commonly found being utilized by many bacteria and fungal species. These compounds are released into the soil surrounding the hyphal web and strip iron from mineral compounds in the soil, the siderophore can then be reabsorbed into the fungal hyphae where the iron can be dissociated from the spiderohore and used. Haselwandter investigated the presence of siderophores in orchid associated mycorrhizal fungi within the genus Rhizoctonia which utilize the siderophore basidiochrome as the major iron-chelating compound. Other vital nutrients may be transferred between mycorrhizal fungi and orchid plants via specialized methods, such as chelating molecules, but more research on this subject is needed.  Symbiont specificity  Current molecular analysis has allowed for the identification of specific taxa forming symbiotic relationships which are of interest in the study, cultivation, and conservation of orchids. This is especially important in the trade and preservation endangered species or orchids of commercial value like the vanilla bean. There have been seen trends in the type of symbioses found in orchids, depending primarily on the life-style of the orchid, as the symbiosis is primarily of benefit to the plant. Terrestrial orchids have been found to commonly associate with Tulasnellaceae, however some autotrophic and non- autotrophic orchids do associate with several ectomycorrhizal fungi. Epiphytic fungi, however, may associate more commonly with limited clades of rhizoctonia, a polyphyletic grouping. These fungi may form significant symbioses with either an epiphytic or terrestrial orchid, but rarely do they associate with both. Using seed-baiting techniques researchers have been able to isolate specific species and strains of symbiotic orchid mycorrhizae. Using this technique seeds of the epiphytic orchid Dendrobium aphyllum were found to germinate to seedlings when paired with fungal strains of Tulasnella, however, seeds of this species did not germinate when treated with Trichoderma fungi taken from adult orchids, indicating there are stage specific symbionts. These fungal symbioses, as well as their affinity towards specific symbionts, vary based on the stage of development and age of the host roots. As an orchid ages the fungal associations become more complex. Mixotrophic orchids like Cephalanthera longibracteata may associate generally with several fungi, most notably from Russulaceae,Tricholomataceae, Sebacinales, Thelephoraceae, as they do not depend as heavily on the fungus for carbon. Some orchids can be very specific in their symbionts, preferring a single class or genus of fungi. Genotypes of Corallorhiza maculata, a myco-heterotrophic orchid, have been found to closely associate with Russulaceae regardless of geological location or the presence of other orchids. The terrestrial Chilean orchids Chloraea collicensis and C. gavilu have been found to have only one key symbiont in the genus Rhizoctonia. Research suggests that orchids which are considered to be generalists will associate with other generalist fungi, often with several species, however orchids with high degrees of specialization will have less fungal associations. The environment may also affect the fungal symbiosis, with differences in tropical versus temperate orchids. The photosynthetic orchid Goodyera pubescens was found to associate with only one dominate fungus, unless subjected to changes in the environment, like drought, in which case the orchid was able to change symbionts in response to stresses. This is unique in that it conflicts with the trends seen in most arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal symbioses which form associations with several fungi at the same time. The knowledge of species-specific fungal symbionts is crucial given the endangered status of many orchids around the world. The identification of their fungal symbionts could prove useful in the preservation and reintroduction of threatened orchids. Researchers in India have used samples from adult orchids to germinate seeds from an endangered orchid Dactylorhiza hatagirea which were found to associate closely with Ceratobasidium.

Additional common cracker ingredients are typically used, such as grain, flour, shortening, leavening, salt and various seasonings. The ingredients are formed into a dough, and the individual crackers are then prepared. Some cheese crackers are prepared using fermented dough. Cheese crackers are typically baked. Another method of preparing cheese crackers involves placing cheese atop warm crackers. Cheese crackers have been described as a \\"high-calorie snack\\", which is due to a higher fat content compared to other types of crackers. Uses In addition to being a snack food, cheese cracker crumbs are sometimes used in recipes as an ingredient, and crumbs or whole crackers are sometimes used as a garnish on various foods.

Contamination began in the 1950s and 1960s. It was used as a dumping ground for hazardous chemicals and oils. This site was used to reprocess or recycle oil, and it was also used as a landfill during the 1950s. The contamination affected the surface water and soil. The EPA got involved in the 1980s and addressed the situation. Human health concerns were a main part of the EPA getting involved because residents lived only about 1,000 to 2,000 feet around the site. Major components of the remedy included excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil from Northerly Wetlands, Tar Patch Area. The back filling of the areas addressed, monitoring of the surface water and sediments, and biological sampling in the Westerly Wetlands. The current status of the site is complete. The remedial stages were completed in the late 1990s and a five-year monitoring of the surface water was completed around 2004.  Origins  Burnt Fly Bog is a rural area covering about 1700 acres of Marlboro Township, Monmouth County. Some part of the land extends to Middlesex County. Burnt Fly Bog consists of an Uplands Area and Westerly Wetlands where most of the waste was dumped. It also includes four lagoons: Asphalt Area, the Tar Patch Area, Northerly Wetlands and the Westerly Wetlands.  Town history  Marlboro is a rural area consisting of dairy, tomato, and potato farms. Before World War II, the township was the nation‚Äôs largest grower of potatoes. Around the 1950s and 1960s the population grew tremendously. After the war the state began to improve and build transportation infrastructure in the township. Developments of housing and buildings began to replace the farm and rural areas of the town, and it became a growing suburb for people that were working in New York and in the large corporations near the town.  Company history  The company Ace-Manzo Inc was the one involved in the waste and chemical dumping in Burnt Fly Bog. Ace-Manzo Inc. is a privately owned company based in Matawan, New Jersey. The owners are Dominick and Carmella Manzo. The company handles water, sewer and utility lines within construction and contractor sectors. The company was founded by Dominick Manzo in 1958. Current estimates show this company has an annual revenue of 19 million dollars. The EPA also blamed Champion Chemical, Imperial Oil and Emil Stevens. The EPA implicated Champion Chemical, Imperial Oil, and Emil Stevens, but they were never successful in proving that they were responsible. The EPA did win a case against Ace-Manzo making them the main cause for the creation of the Superfund site. The state recovered about $1.9 million from a federal lawsuit which held Dominick and Carmella Manzo responsible for the dumping of hazardous materials and waste in Burnt Fly Bog.  Superfund designation  The site was addressed in four stages, one immediate action and three long-term remedial phases which were to focus on clean-up of the Uplands Area and Westerly Wetlands. Immediate actions started in 1982. The immediate action focused on installing a security fence around the lagoons that contained the oils and sludge to hold back any contents. This prevents any contaminated liquids from drifting from the site. The next two stages focused on two sections of the site. They excavated contaminated soil and disposed of the waste and hazardous materials. The last stage focused on 3 sections of the site. They dug up and disposed of PCB- and lead-contaminated soil. They restored the ground with new soil and started construction on the site. The clean-up process continued until 1998 and the EPA began a five-year review of the site. Every five years, the EPA will inspect the condition of the site.  State and national intervention  The EPA got involved around the 1980s, almost 20 years after the initial dumping at the site began. The EPA began the restoration process to complete the performance measures, which includes human exposure, groundwater migration, construction completion (physical cleanup for entire site) and anticipated use. The EPA got involved because the waste and chemicals that were present affected the ground water. This affected the residents' drinking water and main water source. The chemicals also affected the fish and other animals around the site. Health issues were another main concern prompting the EPA to get involved. The chemicals that flooded the lagoons and land caused health issues for the people surrounding the area. Chemicals like lead, PCBs, and methylene chloride had serious effects on people like lung/kidney irritation, rashes, fatigue, GI discomfort and even cancer, which is hard to prove because of the many causes of cancer.  Health & Environmental Hazards Lagoons were made for storage of waste oil and other aqueous wastes. It was also used as a landfill and dump location. These reprocessed oils and other types of waste entered surface waters and also contaminated the soil.  Lead  Lead was one of the chemicals that were discovered in tested soil samples. Lead is a heavy, blue-gray metal commonly found in pigments/paints, pipes, cable covers, and storage batteries. Lead exposure can cause weakness in joints and muscles, and it can severely damage the brain and kidneys in either children or adults. It can cause miscarriages in pregnant women and can damage the reproductive system in males. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has classified lead as a probable human carcinogen.  PCBs  Polychlorinated Biphenyls are synthetic chemicals that have no known sources in the environment. They are oily, colorless or light yellow and can either be solid or liquid. PCBs have no smell. When exposed to the chemical, rashes and acne can be present. It can also cause irritation of the respiratory and digestive systems, induce fatigue, and cause harm to the blood and liver.  Cleanup  The cleanup process of the Superfund Site has been completed. The contaminated soil and sludge from the Uplands Area has been replaced. About 90,000 tons of contaminated soil which contained high levels of PCBs was removed and disposed. In Westerly Wetlands about 6,000 tons of PCB-contaminated soil was dug up. In 1996, the site was considered completed, and the EPA continued to monitor for five more years.  Initial cleanup  The initial cleanup started in 1982 where the EPA repaired an earth mound to hold back the contents of the lagoons. A fence was put in place around the site for removal of the contaminated soil and sludge in the Uplands Area. This was done for to prevent contact with hazardous materials and to prevent the sludge from moving anywhere else. EPA conducted a plan for the cleanup which included removing hazardous materials in the asphalt area, tar patch area and drummed waste area, and removing soil and sludge that contained high levels of PBCS, then replanting and restoring the area. After the cleanup has been completed the EPA designed a five-year program to monitor the groundwater. This plan was in place for two contaminated areas of Burnt Fly Bog; the Uplands Area and the Westerly Wetlands.  Current status  The site investigation started around July 1982 and the remedy action did not start until 1983 because the EPA was selecting the proper remedy for the site. The final remedial stages of the site were completed in September 1998. The final completion of the final construction of the site was not completed until September 2004. EPA also continues to review the site for inspection and the most recent review was done in June 2016.

A portico, designed in the Greek Revival architectural style, was added shortly thereafter along with a great room connecting the formerly outside kitchen. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since March 4, 1975. It is noted for its extraordinary architecture and sprawling 71 acres of gently rolling hills.

Included on the property are period outbuildings and a breathtaking antique barn. Today, the residence is considered to be among the most beautiful of the area and is privately owned. When Alexander Grier built the house, it stood on a pasture grant conveyed by North Caroline in 1788, by land grant number 40. The purchase price was $45 per 100 acres. Concession to modernization was attaching of the two room brick cook-house to the main house. Extreme effort was made to match new to old and to use antique materials whenever possible and available.

This institute was created following a Parisian congress devoted to Gregorian chant and sacred music, held in December 1922. During the Second Vatican Council, this establishment became the Institut de musique liturgique in 1964, and finally was integrated with the Institut catholique de Paris in 1968, after their long collaboration.  History   Creation  Cardinal Archbishop of Paris Louis-Ernest Dubois, father of the Institut. In December 1922, a congress of Gregorian chant and sacred music was organized by l'Art Catholique., (p. 229) This conference was a huge success, thanks to the support of the new Archbishop of Paris since 1920, Louis-Ernest Dubois, and above all to the support of the monks of the Solesmes Abbey, who returned to France after their long exile to Quarr Abbey in England. That is why, taking advantage of this success, the Gregorian Institute in Paris was founded under the protection of the Cardinal. Dom Joseph Gajard of Solesmes was in charge of teaching Gregorian chant there for two years, between Wednesday and Friday. Two years later, a former student of the Schola Cantorum de Paris, Auguste Le Guennant, succeeded him, not only as professor but also as director of the school. Following this creation, Pope Pius XI, a true successor of the liturgical reform of Saint Pope Pius X, expressed his \\"lively satisfaction\\" to Cardinal Dubois, sending him a brief message.  Conference  Just after the Institute was founded, the next congress was held. The Institute's first conference was held on 24 January 1924.  Collaborations  An independent establishment from 1934 onwards, the Institute maintained its collaboration with the Institut Catholique de Paris with its support.(p. 301) Moreover, the ', founded in 1911, had suspended publication since 1940. In 1946, the Institute supported its recovery by taking advantage of its newsletter, from which some of the elements were taken up by the journal.Bulletin mensuel de l'Institut gr√©gorien et de l'Association des amis de l'Institut gr√©gorien The director of the magazine was the first teacher of Gregorian chant, Dom Gajard. It was thanks in particular to the dynamism of his teacher Auguste Le Guennant, who helped restore several journals, despite a difficult period after the war. By promoting many Gregorian teachings such as Gregorian sessions, he turned his institute into a true Gregorian pedagogical centre.(pp. 302)  End of the institute and transformation  When they arrived in Rome in April 1964, the delegates of the Institute and its schola were congratulated by Pope Pius VI for their contribution to Gregorian chant. . Presumably because of the Second Vatican Council, this institute became that same year Institut de musique liturgique, which in 1968 was finally attached to the Institut catholique de Paris, like other catholic institutes.(p. 193)  Publications  The Institute also published its newsletter, which distinguished itself by its collaboration in support of the Revue gr√©gorienne. * Bulletin mensuel de l'Institut gr√©gorien et de l'Association des amis de l'Institut gr√©gorien, : (1923 - 1940, 1946 - 1951, see also Revue gr√©gorienne) * Institut gr√©gorien de Paris, Association des amis de l'Institut gr√©gorien : bulletin bimestriel (1951‚Äì1952),  See also  * Gregorian Chant * Institut catholique de Paris  Bibliography  * Institut Catholique de Paris, Le Livre du Centenaire, 1875 - 1975, Beauchesne, Paris 1975 412 p. on line (excerpt)  References   External links  * Institut gr√©gorien de Paris on data.bnf.fr * Bulletin bimestriel (Institut gr√©gorien de Paris) on data.bnf.fr * Discours du Saint-P√®re Paul VI √† l'Institut gr√©gorien de Paris (on 6 April 1964) * L‚Äôapostolat par le chant : l‚ÄôInstitut gr√©gorien et sa tentative de recr√©ation d‚Äôune tradition gr√©gorienne dans les paroisses catholiques (1923-1963) Institut Catholique de Paris Music in Paris ","title":"Gregorian Institute of Paris"},{"id":"55484887","text":"George Poede is a Romanian political philosopher, professor emeritus at Alexandru Ioan Cuza University in Ia»ôi.

Kannemeyer's family settled in Burgersdorp in the Eastern Cape around 1848. Daniel was a pupil at the South African College in Cape Town between 1859 and 1863. Next he qualified in 1871 as Bachelor of Medicine (MB) and was later licensed to practice by the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. During that same period he married Helen Hill of Edinburgh in November 1871. The couple returned to Burgersdorp and Kannemeyer practised there, in Aliwal North and Smithfield for the next forty years. His wife was locally acclaimed for her soprano voice, while he served on the school board and delivered numerous public lectures on archaeology and natural history. Kannemeyer volunteered to serve in the Ninth Frontier War of 1877-1879, and in the campaigns against Moorosi and the Basuto in 1879 and 1880, his medical training proving to be invaluable. Kannemeyer was responsible for collecting most of the Free State entomological and herpetological specimens housed in the South African Museum. The records show that he collected from Smithfield between 1908 and 1914. His collection of artefacts from the district defined the Smithfield culture, regarded as a Later Stone Age hunting and gathering culture active between 1300-1700 AD, and on the same level as that of the Mesolithic people of Europe or the modern Kalahari bushmen. The hallmark of their industry was the virtual absence of backed microliths and tiny semicircular scrapers. In 1884 he also presented the Museum with his collection of cynodont fossils from the Stormberg coal beds, and subsequently donated to the Albany Museum in Grahamstown. He collaborated with the naturalist Roland Trimen in studying butterflies, and with the visiting palaeontologist Harry Seeley in 1888/9, loaning Seeley many of his fossil specimens which, as in the case of Alfred Brown, were never returned. He gathered extensive information on Bushman lore and on the medicinal properties of local plants. He was loath to publish any of his findings, preferring to leave that to career palaeontologists. He did publish a Note on Locusts as Propagators of Foot and Mouth Disease in which he links locusts soiled by saliva from infected cattle with the spread of Foot- and-mouth disease.

He was an early exponent of Op art in New Zealand in the 1960s‚Äì70s. In 1990 he originated a style of illusionary abstract painting based on chiaroscuro, creating the impression of three-dimensional forms and textures on a flat canvas. Since 2009 he has used digital techniques in returning to an Op art style. Williams is almost unique amongst his contemporaries in New Zealand art for having embraced abstraction at the start of his career and exclusively throughout. His work is held in all major New Zealand public collections. A monograph by Edward Hanfling was published by Ron Sang in 2014 coinciding with a survey exhibition.  Early life  Williams was born in WhakatƒÅne on 22 April 1940. He moved between the Bay of Plenty Region and Auckland between 1940 and 1951 when he settled permanently in Auckland. He began secondary school at Avondale College in 1954, where his art teacher was Robert Nettleton Field. In 1956, Williams was obliged to leave school prematurely to help support his family following the death of his father, though Field continued to mentor his former student. In 1955, Williams began work at ceramics firm Crown Lynn, where he received guidance and encouragement from Frank Carpay. He subsequently pursued a more intensive design opportunity at Ted Dutch's art and design studio, receiving training in painting, design and graphic techniques until 1961 when he established his own studio. In 1957 and 1958, Williams attended Elam School of Fine Arts part-time, where he met Don Binney and Graham Percy. Williams married Helen Jermyn in 1962. They had three sons, and from 1965 to 1972 lived near Te Henga (Bethells Beach), in West Auckland. The couple divorced in 1985. In the mid-1960s, photographer Marti Friedlander made a series of portraits of Williams.  Career   Early work  Williams made oil paintings as well as works in gouache on paper during the years 1956 to 1961. They feature adjacent and layered patches of mainly muted colour along with linear elements. There are similarities to the paintings of Ted Dutch and to mid-twentieth-century School of Paris abstract painters, such as Vieira da Silva and Georges Matthieu. Beginning in the early 1960s, Williams began to make work with strong geometric shapes influenced by Josef Albers and Mark Rothko.  Op art  Chromatic Invention No. 2 1970 Silkscreen 435 x 635 mm Mervyn Williams Daedal Series 6 (Epicentre) 1979 Acrylic on Canvas 1220 x 1220mm In the early to mid 1960s, Williams began working in the Op art style that developed over the same period in Europe and the United States. His compositions of closely spaced lines, geometric shapes and high-keyed, contrasting colours were carefully rendered to create optical illusions and vibrations. He aimed to create the impression of movement and three-dimensionality on a static, two-dimensional painted surface, and to bring the experience of visual art closer to that of music, unfolding over time. The Chromatic Invention series (1969‚Äì70) reflects the artist's admiration of Johann Sebastian Bach, and his belief that invention is the most important quality in art. Williams' work of the 1960s and 1970s relates to that of European artists such as Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely. Op art came to prominence in the United States with the Museum of Modern Art‚Äôs exhibition The Responsive Eye in 1965, and had a large public following. In New Zealand, a small number of artists worked in an Op style, notably Gordon Walters and Ray Thorburn. Williams and Walters travelled to Melbourne, Australia, together in 1975, breaking their return journey to visit Sydney to see an exhibition of recent paintings by Bridget Riley at the Coventry Gallery. Williams‚Äô Op art was partly a reaction against the emphasis on expressive mark-making and individual style in 1950s Abstract Expressionism. He believed in the universal appeal of optical illusion, declaring that it ‚Äúappeals to a more innocent side of ourselves‚Äù. He experimented with photo- mechanical techniques to produce optical patterns as efficiently as possible and in multiples, thereby making it available to more people. The exactitude and impersonal finish of Williams‚Äô paintings directs the viewer‚Äôs attention to the images themselves and their own perception, rather than the artist‚Äôs touch or sensibility. Important series from Williams‚Äô Op art phase of the 1970s include the Daedal series, the Quotient (1973) and Delta (1978‚Äì80) series. These series were shown during the 1970s at Barry Lett Galleries in Auckland and the Elva Bett Gallery in Wellington. A selection from all three series was shown in a two-person exhibition with Gordon Walters at the Canterbury Society of Arts Gallery in 1984.  Crusties  In 1980 Williams visited New York and London, and saw the exhibition A New Spirit in Painting at the Royal Academy, London, and other important exhibitions in New York, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. Upon his return he began to make paintings with thickly encrusted paint and simpler compositions. However, the interest in perception continued, as the raised paint surfaces and layering of colours generated a play of light and shadow. Williams was part of the Seven Painters/The Eighties exhibition that toured New Zealand during 1982‚Äì83, starting at the Sarjeant Gallery in Whanganui. The exhibition also featured Gretchen Albrecht, Stephen Bambury, Max Gimblett, Richard Killeen, James Ross, and Ian Scott. In 1983, Williams was included in the exhibition The Grid: Lattice and Network at the Auckland City Art Gallery. In the second half of the 1980s, Williams continued his quest to ‚Äúarticulate light‚Äù, using gels and pastes to produce a concrete or tactile support that he then sprayed with thin films of paint. Paintings such as Chart (1989) and Desert Sand (1986) generate changing effects of light and colour that depend on the conditions under which they are seen and the position of the viewer. Williams‚Äô paintings of this period have similarities with the 1970s ‚Äúthick field‚Äù abstract paintings of American artists Jules Olitski and Larry Poons. However, art historian Michael Dunn contrasts Williams‚Äô interest in light and illusion with the emphasis on flatness and objecthood in American abstraction.  Wooden constructions  Mervyn Williams Odyssey 1989 Wooden Construction 1600 mm dia In 1989, Williams was awarded the Tylee Cottage Residency in Whanganui, a position administered by the Sarjeant Gallery Te Whare o Rehua, and he continued to live in Whanganui until 1991. He collected wooden detritus washed down the Whanganui River from beaches around the river mouth, and with the aid of a local joiner created subtle geometric compositions. Williams was attracted to the natural textures, tones and patterns of the weathered wood, and he has said that their ‚Äúsurfaces had an eloquence about them that had evolved spontaneously, rather than been laboured over with modelling paste.‚Äù Notable examples are Odyssey (1989, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TƒÅmaki) and Organon 1 (1989, Sarjeant Gallery Te Whare o Rehua). The wooden constructions were exhibited at Gow Langsford Gallery, Auckland, in July‚ÄìAugust 1989, and later that year under the title Points of Departure at the Sarjeant Gallery, where Williams also made a large sculptural installation in the central domed space.  Illusionary paintings  Mervyn Williams Pale Jade 2012 Acrylic on Canvas 912 x 912mm During 1990‚Äì91, while living in Whanganui, Williams worked on techniques for creating the illusion of physical texture on a flat, painted surface. Eventually, using a thin film of paint and creating fine shifts in tone and colour, he achieved an almost photographic rendering of effects of light and shadow. The series evolved as a number of distinct formats or groups, each based on a simple, geometric structure. The paintings are primarily studies in perception and light. Williams has been likened to a ‚Äúmagician‚Äù because his paintings generate responses of surprise and wonder, and a degree of mystery surrounds his technique. The illusionary paintings are considered an original achievement, without obvious precedent in the history of art internationally. They were first exhibited at Gow Langsford Gallery in March 1992, following Williams‚Äô return to Auckland the previous year. The illusionary paintings are representational in the manner of the Old Masters, and can thus be described accurately as trompe l'oeil works, but they represent abstract forms and ambiguous phenomena. Williams has described them as ‚Äúat once both totally abstract and as representational as you can get.‚Äù According to curator Anna- Marie White, Williams is significant because ‚Äúhe created a new direction within abstract painting while simultaneously challenging the very nature of abstraction as a non-representational art form.‚Äù Important examples of the illusionary paintings are Where Corals Lie (1994, Rutherford Collection) and Precept (Gold) (2005, private collection). The illusionary paintings draw attention to perception itself, and encourage critical reflection on the relationship between what we see and what we believe we see.  Digital mixed media paintings  Solar Flare 2011 Mixed Media on Canvas 1220 x 1220mm Williams began to experiment with digital techniques in 2009, leading him to revisit his Op style of the 1960s and 1970s. He developed a new body of work combining digital processes with traditional painting techniques. Works such as Solar Flare (2011), Centrifuge (2013) and Paragon (2013) create optical vibrations that would have been difficult to achieve before the advent of digital technology. Parallels have been drawn between Williams' attitude to digital technology and the spirit of excitement, hope and innovation that informed his original Op works in the 1960s.  Sculpture  Williams has produced sculpture throughout his career, though it was only during his time in Whanganui that it came to the fore. In 2007 he began to devote more time to sculpture, and produced a series of works using tubular modules in bronze, stainless steel, aluminium and concrete, realising them on an increasingly large scale.

The molecular mass of the protein is 4,94 kDa (calculated with ProtParam ExPASy).  Family and homology  ATX- II belongs to the sea anemone neurotoxin family. Purification studies of ATX- II and the two other sea anemone neurotoxins, I and III, have revealed the polypeptide nature of these toxins.B√©ress L, B√©ress R, Wunderer G. Purification of three polypeptides with neuroand cardiotoxic activity from the sea anemone Anemonia sulcata. Toxicon. 1975;13(5):359‚Äì64. Toxins I and II are very potent paralyzing toxins that act on crustaceans, fish and mammals and have cardiotoxic and neurotoxic effects.Beress, L., and R. Beress. \\"Reinigung zweier krabbenl√§hmender Toxine aus der Seeanemone Anemonia sulcata.\\" Kieler Meeresforsch 27 (1971): 117-127. Toxin III has been shown to cause muscular contraction with subsequent paralysis in the crab Carcinus maenas. All three toxins are highly homologous and block neuromuscular transmission in crabs. Four other sea anemone toxins purified from Condylactis aurantiaca show close sequence similarities with toxins I, II and III of Anemonia sulcata.B√©ress R, Wunderer G, B√©ress L.

Hoppe-Seyler's Zeitschrift f√ºr physiologische Chemie. 1976;357(1):409‚Äì14. The effect of these different toxins on Carcinus meanas is visually indistinguishable, namely cramp followed by paralysis and death. However, their mode of action differs. Toxin IV of Condylactis aurantiaca causes a repetitive firing of the excitatory axon for several minutes resulting in muscle contraction without causing a detectable change in the amplitude of the excitatory junction potentials (EJPS). In contrast, the application of Toxin II from Anemonia sulcata results in the increase of the EJPS up to 40 mV causing large action potentials at the muscle fibers.Rathmayer, W., Barbara Jessen, and L. Beress. \\"Effect of toxins of sea anemones on neuromuscular transmission.\\" Naturwissenschaften 62.11 (1975): 538-539. Other toxins with a similar mode of action to ATX-II are Œ±-scorpion toxins. Although both sea anemone and Œ±-scorpion toxins bind to common overlapping elements on the extracellular surface of sodium channels, they belong to distinct families and share no sequence homology.Catterall WA. Neurotoxins that Act on Voltage-Sensitive Sodium Channels in Excitable Membranes. Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology. 1980;20(1):15‚Äì43. The toxins AFT-II (from Anthopleura fuscoviridis) and ATX-II differ by only one amino acid, L36A, and the protein sequence of BcIII (from Bunodosoma caissarum) is 70% similar to ATX-II.Oliveira JS, Redaelli E, Zaharenko AJ, Cassulini RR, Konno K, Pimenta DC, et al. Binding Specificity of Sea Anemone Toxins to Nav1.1-1.6 Sodium Channels. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 2004;279(32):33323‚Äì35.

Moreover, studies suggest that ATX-II interacts with glutamic acid residue (Glu-1613 and 1616 in Nav1.2) on the third and fourth transmembrane loop (S3-S4) of domain IV on the alpha-subunit of neuronal channel Nav1.2 in rats.Rogers JC, Qu Y, Tanada TN, Scheuer T, Catterall WA.

In small and large dorsal root ganglion cells mainly Nav1.1, Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 are sensitive to ATX-II.Klinger AB, Eberhardt M, Link AS, Namer B, Kutsche LK, Schuy ET, et al. Sea-Anemone Toxin ATX-II Elicits A-Fiber- Dependent Pain and Enhances Resurgent and Persistent Sodium Currents in Large Sensory Neurons. Molecular Pain. 2012;8. The binding of the toxin can only occur when the sodium channel is open.Romey G, Abita JP, Schweitz H, Wunderer G, Lazdunski. Sea anemone toxin:a tool to study molecular mechanisms of nerve conduction and excitation-secretion coupling. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 1976Jan;73(11):4055‚Äì9.  Mode of action  The major action of ATX-II is to delay sodium channel inactivation. Studies using giant crayfish axons and myelinated fibers from frogs indicate that ATX-II acts at low doses, without changing the opening mechanism or steady-state potassium conductance. This mode of action is caused by binding of ATX-II across the extracellular loop. ATX-II slows conformational changes or translocation that are necessary for closing the sodium channel. When applied externally in high concentrations (100 ŒºM range), ATX-II reduces potassium conductance, yet without modifying the kinetic properties of the potassium channel.Bergman C, Dubois J, Rojas E, Rathmayer W. Decreased rate of sodium conductance inactivation in the node of Ranvier induced by a polypeptide toxin from sea anemone. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes. 1976;455(1):173‚Äì84. ATX-II prolongs the duration of the cardiac action potential, as demonstrated in cultured embryonic chicken cardiac muscle cells.Romey, G., et al. \\"Pharmacological properties of the interaction of a sea anemone polypeptide toxin with cardiac cells in culture.\\" Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 213.3 (1980): 607-615. ATX-II also selectively activates A-fibers of peripheral nerves projecting to the sensory neuron of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) by enhancing resurging currents in DRGs. This mechanism can thereby induce itch-like sensations and pain. Toxicity People who got in contact with Anemonia sulcata reported symptoms such as pain and itch. The same symptoms were found in human research subjects after injection of ATX-II into their skin. In cardiac muscle tissue of various mammals, ATX-II has been shown to produce large and potentially lethal increases in heart rate.Alsen C. Biological significance of peptides from Anemonia sulcata. Fed Proc. 1983;42(1):101-8. The lethal dose of ATX-II for the crab Carcinus maenas is 2 Œºg/kg.

The lake's area is and its average depth is about . History Seokchon Lake was originally a part of the Han River. There was an island named Burido in the middle of the Han River dividing it into two, Songpa River (the north part) and Sincheon River(the south part). In April 1971, a construction to connect Burido with land has started. It was proceeded by enlarging the Songpa River and closing the Sincheon River. By this construction, the closed southern part of the Han River became Seokchon Lake, and the land made by the reclamation project became Jamsil-dong and Sincheon-dong. In the 1970s, Seokchon Lake used to be a tacky lake right after the construction. So people created a walking trail and planted trees, transforming the area into a park. After some time, Seokchon Lake started to suffer from water pollution, causing foul smells. This caused people to avoid Seokchon Lake Park. In 2001, Songpagu designated it to make into a tourist attraction and did some maintenance business. This caused the water to become clear and the ecological system to be recovered. East Lake The East Lake has a trail which is connected to West Lake under the Jamsilhosugyo (Jamsil Lake Bridge). Beside the trail, there are some facilities including some rest area and public restrooms. At the north side, there is a two-floor building which has the Songpa Travel Information Center on the second floor. In October 2014, the Rubber Duck was held on the East Lake by Lotte Group to celebrate the opening of the new Lotte World Mall. Also, the Super Moon Project was held in September 2016, an art project planned by the art collaborative group FriendsWithYou. The Super Moon is a 60-foot inflatable sculpture surrounded by a garden of eight symbolic planets of color and light. Panorama of the lake West Lake The West Lake is 112,065„é° large and is slightly larger than the East Lake. Around the West Lake, there are Seoul Playground and Lotte World's Magic Island. Seoul play ground Seoul play ground (Hangul: ÏÑúÏö∏ÎÜÄÏù¥ÎßàÎãπ; RR: Seoul Lorimadang) is an outdoor stage located inside Seokchon Lake Park where different kinds of folk arts are performed. It was built in 1984 for the presentation and preservation of Korean traditional folk art. The whole facility is 8,250„é° large, and seats are 825„é° large having seating capacity of 1,500. The building is a traditional style tile-roofed house, which has hip-and-gable roof and entasis columns. Annually from April to October, Intangible Cultural Property and fusion folk art performance are held every weekend. Also, special performances are perform in traditional holidays of Korea (Seollal, Daeboreum, Chuseok). Songpa Sandae Noli, sheaf burning are some of the major performances held in the place. Festivals Seokchon Lake has many various festivals, including the Cherry Blossom Festival, Deciduous Street Festival, and the Seokchon Lake Concert. These festivals show many attractive parts of the Seokchon Lake. Cherry Blossom Festival The Seokchon Lake Cherry Blossom Festival is one of the most representative spring festivals in Seoul. The festival has many events such as shows performed by popular singers and amateur performance team. During the festival season, the Lotte World Tower at Seokchon Lake and the Magic Island combine with cherry blossoms, making a beautiful landscape. Deciduous Street Festival In fall, Seokchon Lake Deciduous Street Festival begin, and Seokchon Lake is filled with thousands of deciduous leaves such as platanus, King cherry trees, ginkgo trees and maple trees. On the lake, you can see colorful Lanterns, and there is a night scenery view photo zone. Seokchon Lake Music Concert The Seokchon Lake Music Concert is held at East Side Central Waterfront Stage every Friday, Saturday and Sunday from mid-April to November. There are performances of various genres such as singing, dancing, pop, musical instrument. Seokchon Lake Caf√© Street The cafe street is located next to the East Lake, about 1.1 km. There are about 12 cafes in the caf√© street. There is one at approximately every 100 meters. There are various cafes in the vicinity of Seokchon Lake, which have unique names and different atmospheres. There are coffee shops, bakeries, and places you can eat fusion dishes. Also, since outdoor business is allowed in this area, one can eat outside looking at the scenery of the Seokchon Lake. Controversy From 2010 to 2013, the average water level of Seokchon lake was lowered from 4.63 meters to 4.17 meters. About 4 million tons of water was leaked from Seokchon Lake. Also, several large underground voids and sinkholes were observed near the lake and caused controversy about safety problems. According to an investigation by the City of Seoul, it was caused by massive underground operation from the construction of Lotte World Tower and Seoul Subway Line 9. In 2013, the City of Seoul started supplying water to maintain the lake's water level. As of 2015, the lake had an average water level of 4.8 meters.

It is the fourth-longest cave in Romania: only Pe»ôtera V√¢ntului, Humpleu-Poieni»õa Cave, and Hodobana Cave are longer. Most speleological sources estimate its length at , although a length of has also been reported. Some Romanian news sources report a more conservative 11,000 metres (36,000 ft). It is considered a natural monument of Romania. The cave was first historically documented in 1880 by V. Dumitrescu. The first serious attempt at scientific exploration was made in 1956 by Professor Sever Popescu of Turnu Severin. Finally, specialists from the Emil Racovi»õƒÉ Institute of Speleology at the Romanian Academy began true systematic exploration in 1962.  Description  Topolni»õa Cave is located at from Drobeta-Turnu Severin, between the villages of Marga and Cire»ôu. It has at least four entrances. The cave's primary entrance is in the central part of the Mehedin»õi Plateau, where the Topolni»õa River plunges down into the earth. The river later emerges farther downstream at the foot of a hill. Topolni»õa Cave has a huge number of passages and galleries arranged over five floors, many of which have attracted fanciful names as a result of the speleothems that have formed in them. One of the largest galleries, at long, is named the Racovi»õƒÉ Gallery in honor of Emil Racovi»õƒÉ, a noted Romanian explorer. Approximately from the entrance is the Bat's Gallery, containing a bat colony and a large guano heap. Other features within the cave include lakes, waterfalls, rapids, and massive forests of stalactites and stalagmites. Neolithic remains have also been found within the cave.  Cave access  Best described as \\"labyrinthine\\", Topolni»õa Cave is a difficult cave to explore even for experienced cavers. Access for tourists is permitted only once per year, on a feast day in August, where guides lead tours into the cave to view the Racovi»õƒÉ Gallery. Otherwise, the cave is gated and access is only available by permission of the Romanian Academy. In the 1980s, there was some government interest in adding tourist-access features such as stairs, railings, and electric lights, but funding fell through before the Romanian Revolution and nothing was completed.  Fauna  The cave's temperature hovers between , making it a relatively warm cave. As a result, it is a suitable habitat for some fauna, including the largest colony of greater horseshoe bats in Europe. A 2015 survey conducted as part of an effort to protect Romania's bats found 7,482 individual horseshoe bats living in the cave. The colony in the Bat's Gallery is mainly composed of insectivorous Mediterranean horseshoe bats, Daubenton's bats, and long-fingered bats. Radiocarbon dating has shown that the bat guano from that colony has been continuously deposited since 1694. In 2009, a pair of bearded vultures was spotted at the cave by hunters. The sighting was treated with some excitement, as the bearded vulture is no longer extant in Romania. Plenty of invertebrate species live in or around Topolni»õa Cave. Specimens of Clausiliidae, or door snails, such as Macedonica marginata, have been found in the cave.Loosjes, F. E., and A.

They are managed by Rocky Romero since October 2017. After training together in NJPW's dojo since February 2012, the two begun wrestling in the federation as young lions under the ring names of Sho Tanaka and Yohei Komatsu in November of the same year, starting a feud with each other the following month. They became tag team partners on March 3, 2013, until the promotion sent them on an overseas learning excursion in January 2016 which notably saw them wrestle in Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) under the names Raijin and Fujin, and in Ring of Honor (ROH) as The Tempura Boyz. The duo returned to NJPW as Roppongi 3K during the King of Pro-Wrestling event on October 9, 2017, now managed by Romero and a part of the Chaos stable. The name established them as the spiritual successors of Romero's team Roppongi Vice, which had amicably spit up earlier the same day; the \\"3K\\" came from Romero's claim that Roppongi 3K were 3000 times better than Roppongi Vice. Within their first 30 days back in NJPW, Roppongi 3K would win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship in their return match, and become the first team to win the Super Jr. Tag Tournament, NJPW's premier junior heayvweight tag team tournament, as the reignings champions. They would go on to become four-time IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions and win the following two editions of the Super Jr. Tag Tournament, becoming the first team (and individuals) to win it twice and later extending their record. History  Training and origins (2012-2013)  Both Sho Tanaka and Yohei Komatsu entered the New Japan Pro- Wrestling (NJPW) dojo in February 2012 and made their debuts for the promotion the following November during the NJPW NEVER Openweight Championship Decision Tournament event, both losing to Takaaki Watanabe in singles matches (on November 15 for Tanaka, and November 19 for Komatsu). Their second match would be against each other on the first night of the Road to Tokyo Dome event on December 6, which resulted in a draw via time limit. This would mark the start of a storyline rivalry against each other during the rest of the event.  New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2013-2016)  Sho (left) and Yoh (right) as the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions in November 2017 Tanaka and Komatsu started wrestling as a tag team on March 3, 2013 during the 'Raising An Army Memorial Series event ,, although they would also regularly keep on feuding; after yet another feud, they would ultimately start focus on their work as a team in September 2015 during the final days of the Road to Destruction event in September 2015. On January 6, 2016, NJPW announced that Tanaka and Komatsu would be leaving the promotion at the end of the month for an overseas learning excursion to their Mexican partner promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). They were the first rookies sent as a team since No Limit (Tetsuya Naito and Yujiro Takahashi) in 2009. They wrestled their NJPW farewell matches as a tag team across the six shows on the following Fantastica Mania 2016 tour, a joint event between NJPW and CMLL; their final effort was a loss in a non-title match against CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Champions Guerrero Maya Jr. & The Panther on January 24, 2016.  Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (2016)  After Komatsu and Tanaka fully transitioned to CMLL, the company redubbed them Fujin and Raijin respectively, after the Japanese gods of wind and thunder. In the Mexican promotion, Fujin and Raijin came under the guidance of Okumura, a 12-year veteran of Mexican wrestling, and Kamaitachi, a previous NJPW rookie sent to CMLL, with the four forming a new version of the La Ola Amarilla / La Fiebre Amarilla (\\"The Yellow Wave\\" / \\"The Yellow Fever\\") stable. As a trio with Kamaitachi, they were dubbed Los Kamikazes de Oriente (\\"The Kamikazes of the Orient\\"). Fujin and Raijin debuted for CMLL on February 2 in Guadalajara, making their Arena M√©xico debuts five days later. At Homenaje a Dos Leyendas, the two, together with Okumura and Kamaitachi, lost against Dragon Lee, M√°scara Dorada, M√≠stico and Valiente in a Best two-out-of-three At√≥micos \\"Lucha Libre rules\\" tag team match. During their time in Mexico, Tanaka and Komatsu also worked for other local promotions, including Desastre Total Ultraviolento (DTU) and Liga Elite.  Ring of Honor (2016-2017)  Tanaka and Komatsu remained in Mexico until September 2016, when they relocated to the United States where they resumed using the individual names of Sho Tanaka and Yohei Komatsu, while taking on the monicker of \\"The Tempura Boyz\\" as a team; they most prominently worked in Ring of Honor (ROH) during that time. They would lose their debut match against Colt Cabana and Dalton Castle on October 1st tapings before going on to lose to Cheeseburger and Will Ferrara and The All Night Express on the first and second nights of the Glory By Honor XV event respectively. They would unsuccessfully challenge The Young Bucks for the ROH World Tag Team Championship on January 14, 2017, and again on June 3rd, before teaming up with Canaba to unsuccessfully try to capture the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship from Dalton Castle and The Boys. On June 18, they defeated Xyberhawx2000 as a part of the Chikara event The Johnny Kidd Invitational 2017. In July 2017, Tanaka and Komatsu took part in NJPW's two-day G1 Special in USA event that the promotion held in Long Beach, California. The following week, they traveled with the NJPW crew to take part in an event held by Revolution Pro Wrestling (RevPro) in London, England.  Return to NJPW (2017-present)  On September 16, 2017, at NJPW's Destruction in Hiroshima show, the Roppongi Vice tag team of Beretta and Rocky Romero had their final match together before amicably splitting up. Later that night, Romero confronted IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions Funky Future (Ricochet and Ryusuke Taguchi), revealing that he was now the manager of a new, secret team dubbed \\"Roppongi 3K\\", with the name coming from Romero's claim that Roppongi 3K were 3000 times better than Roppongi Vice were. Even after Roppongi 3K were confirmed as the next challengers for Funky Future's titles, the identities of the two wrestlers were kept secret. On October 9 at King of Pro-Wrestling, Roppongi 3K were revealed as the returning Tanaka and Komatsu, now billed individually as \\"Sho\\" and \\"Yoh\\", who defeated Funky Future to capture the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship in their return match, which was also first title opportunity in NJPW. Through their affiliation with Romero, Sho and Yoh also became part of the Chaos stable. Later that month, Roppongi 3K entered the 2017 Super Jr. Tag Tournament for the first time, defeating Hirai Kawato and Kushida in the first round andLos Ingobernables de Japon (Bushi and Hiromu Takahashi) in the semifinals, before defeating Super 69 (ACH and Ryusuke Taguchi) in the finals at Power Struggle on November 5, becoming the first team to win the tournament as the current NJPW Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions. On January 4, 2018, Roppongi 3K lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship to The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) at Wrestle Kingdom 12 in Tokyo Dome, before winning it back on January 28 at The New Beginning in Sapporo. They soon dropped the titles to El Desperado and Yoshinobu Kanemaru of Suzuki-gun on New Japan's 46th Anniversary Show, in a three-way tag team match which also involved of Bushi and Hiromu Takahashi (the later being their former CMLL stablemate as Kamaitachi) of Los Ingobernables de Japon. They would then lose their title rematch on June 9 at Dominion 6.9 in Osaka-jo Hall, but would fail to regain the titles. Sho and Yoh they entered the 2018 Super Junior Tag Tournament, which was now using a point-based system instead of brackets; they would go on to win 5 matches out of 7 and scoring 10 points; they would then face the other two top-scoring teams, El Desperado and Kanemaru and Bushi and Shingo Takagi of Los Ingobernables de Japon, in a three-way tag team match at Power Struggle where Roppongi 3K became the first team (and individuals) to win the tournament twice.https://www.njpw.co.jp/tornament/153945?showResult=1 The three teams would face off again on January 4 at Wrestle Kingdom 13 for El Desperado and Kanemaru's IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, but Bushi and Takagi would win the match. At NJPW's 47th Anniversary Show on March 6, Roppongi 3K defeated Bushi and Takagi to win the titles for a third time, eventually losing them to El Phantasmo and Taiji Ishimori of Bullet Club on June 16 at Kizuna Road. After Yoh pinned the Guerrillas of Destiny's Tanga Loa during a 10-man tag team match at Destruction in Kobe, Roppongi 3K received a title match for the Guerillas of Destiny's IWGP Tag Team Championship at Fighting Spirit Unleashed (their first opportunity at the title), but were unsuccessful. Roppongi 3K entered their third Super Junior Tag Tournament in October 2019, winning five matches out of seven and scoring 10 points like the previous year to advance to the finals on November 3 at Power Struggle, where they defeated El Desperado and Yoshinobu Kanemaru to become the first three- time winners of the tournament. As the result, they received a match for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against El Phantasmo and Ishimori on January 5, 2020 at Wrestle Kingdom 14; they were successful at the event, becoming four-time champions and gaining their first win at Wrestle Kingdom.

Smith early developed a taste for art. She was educated in the Western Female College, Oxford, Ohio, and studied art during vacations in Cincinnati, Ohio. After her education she went abroad and studied in Paris and Dresden. After an absence of nearly three years she returned to the United States and opened a studio in Washington, D. C., in 1871. Career She achieved marked success in portrait painting, having many prominent persons as sitters, among them Secretary Edwin Stanton, a full- length portrait of whom was ordered from her by the representatives of the city government. She also painted the portrait of Mary Frances Grant Cramer, a sister of Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. While in that city, she became a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. During her years of labor in Washington her eyes failed her, but after a season of rest she again went to Paris to learn the S√®vres method of painting on porcelain. She also studied in the Dresden Gallery, receiving criticisms from the celebrated Director Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld. On her return she opened a studio in New York City, where she had the best possible recognition from the literary and art circles. While there she was elected a member of Sorosis, in which society she held the position of chairman of the art committee. She usually had several students, whom she taught gratuitously. When fifteen years of age, she had a severe illness, during which she vowed to build a church for the poor in her native place, which through her aid and influence was done, and to which she gave her interest and help. She painted in Cincinnati, and her portraits there were highly praised. She was the instructor in art in Chautauqua, New York, for four years, having her studio in the Kellogg Memorial Building. She gave up her studio in New York to devote her time and care to her invalid mother. Personal life In 1895 she married F. Carl Smith (1867-1955), a marine and genre painter. The couple worked and studied in Paris for several years, then New York City, to finally settling in Washington, D.C. in 1902. In 1917 they moved to Pasadena, California. Her father owned a large tract of land in Florida, near the mouth of the St. John's river, where he had an orange grove and a winter home. There she spent several winters. She died in 1938.

Also dubbed the \\"shirtmaker of Presidents\\", thanks to its several years serving at the Elysee Palace, this house has been fully active for two generations before being temporarily closed for a period of 13 years. In 2011, the heirs decided to relaunch the fashion house.http://pluton-magazine.com/2018/06/12/thuillier- paris-renaissance-de-chemiserie-presidents/  Robert Thuillier  Robert Thuillier was born in Paris in 1894. From the age of six, he was raised by his mother; she worked for Parisian couturiers, in particular doing hems of shirts. Thuillier accompanied his mother to work and helped her with different tasks. He drew the attention of a master shirtmaker who decided to take the young Thuillier under his wing and taught him to become a master shirtmaker. Robert mastered the techniques of designing shirts, and was hired by the luxury house Amos Sulka & Company. He was a cutter in this house before he was called up for World War I. After World War I, Thuillier resumed his position at Amos Sulka & Company where he quickly rose through the ranks until he became responsible for the whole team of cutters in the Parisian workshops. During this time, he trained a large number of cutters of the next generation. In 1930, Thuillier left Amos Sulka & Company to set up his own business, Thuillier Chemisier. He opened his first boutique on rue de Marignan, in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. This was a prestigious location, and Thuillier knew that it could help him draw the attention of a demanding clientele, accustomed to high-quality designs. In the boutique, he was assisted not only by his sons, Jacques, Ren√© and Andr√©, but also by his wife Gabrielle, who was trained in dressmaking. In those days, the family worked in the workshop located in the back room of the store. In 1938, following several years of activity and after receiving his new certificate of \\"chemisier cr√©ateur\\", Robert Thuillier decided to move out and chose a more discrete location. His new boutique was located on the upper floor of a building at 21 rue Galil√©e in the 8th arrondissement. The years following World War II were challenging for Thuillier Chemisier. In the 1950s, Thuillier dismissed personnel, including his sons Jacques and Ren√©. His sons ultimately found work at Korrigan, before being employed by Lacoste. Some years later, Andr√© was laid off as well, and went to work at Washington Tremlett, another shirtmaker where he had served as cutter for three years. At the beginning of the 1960s, Thuillier entrusted the management of the business to his son Andr√©. Thuillier died in 1969.  Three brothers   Rue Marbeuf  Andr√© made major changes to the fashion house at the beginning of the 1960s. Along with his brothers, he established the boutique in a prestigious Parisian district, 9 rue Marbeuf, the famous \\"street of the shirtmakers\\", which runs through the heart of the 8th arrondissement. In the 1960s, during the post-war boom period of the \\"Trente Glorieuses\\", Thuillier's workshop reached its maximum production capacity. The family entrusted the task of shirts' assembly to another workshop in Palluau-sur- Indre, in order to meet an increasing demand, while maintaining the steps of cutting and patterning in the family workshop on rue Marbeuf.  The shirtmaker of presidents  When Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing was elected President of France in 1974, he appointed Andr√© Thuillier to tailor his shirts. In 1981, Fran√ßois Mitterrand succeeded d'Estaing, and used the same shirtmarker as his predecessor. During his two terms in office, more than 195 traditional shirts, 30 nightshirts and 30 dress shirts, were specially designed for Mitterrand, several of which have been sold at auctions organized in his honour.) In 1996, the newly elected President Jacques Chirac received the President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela. As a welcome gift, he offered him a bespoke shirt designed by the Thuillier family. It was by serving three presidents that Thuillier became known as \\"the shirtmaker of Presidents\\".  Relaunch of the Tuillier brand  In 1998, the Thuillier family retired and decided to put an end to shirt making. More than a decade passed before Didier Thuillier (son of Ren√© and Huguette Thuillier) considered relaunching the brand. The premature death of Huguette Thuiller, who had always regretted the decision to stop the activity, encouraged him to register the trademark \\"Thuillier Chemisier\\" at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2011. In 2014, Didier Thuillier and his son Franck established a partnership with entrepreneur Chadi Srour. Srour and Franck Thuillier have taken over the management of the company, under the trademark Thuillier Paris. They continue to work with historic suppliers, in Palluau-sur-Indre for the shirts and in Paris for the handmade ties. For the first time in its history in 2017, Thuillier Paris has been exported to overseas markets. For his state visit to the United States in April 2018, the French President Emmanuel Macron has been sporting French finery, wearing ties and shirts from Thuillier Paris. For the White House gala, Macron wore a cotton poplin plastron shirt which took 11 hours to make.https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/first-lady-melania- trump-chanel-first-state-dinner-while-brigitte-macron-sports-louis- vuitton-1202659933/  References  Clothing companies of France ","title":"Thuillier Paris"},{"id":"55485422","text":"Division No. 21, Unorganized is an unorganized area in northwestern Manitoba.

The crash caused significant media attention due to a suspicion the aircraft might be transporting nuclear material which was later found untrue.  The flight  The flight left Prague Ruzyne earlier that day with final destination Paris and an intermediate stop in St. Gallen Altenrhein. On board were pilot Rudi Wierschem, businessmen Josef Rimmele and Klaus Eichler (a former East German official), as well as two barmaids. Mr Rimmele had an outstanding arrest warrant by German authorities for tax evasion and fraud.  Accident  In the evening of 24 January, an aircraft was reported missing just north of the Swiss city of Rorschach, above Lake Constance a few miles west of the airport of St. Gallen Altenrhein. Initial attempts to locate the aircraft in the lake had been delayed due to deteriorating weather. The aircraft was lifted from the lake on 8 February 1994. Analysis at the time was inconclusive as the flaps were in neutral position which was unexpected for a planned landing at the nearby airport or an intentional watering. One of the aircraft doors was found open with only 3 of the 5 expected passengers on board. The pilot, one of the barmaids and a dog have not been recovered.  Legal significance  The case was discussed in the 1995 edition of the commentary to the Constitution of Bavaria. The authors concluded that lack of clarity of the border line in the lake would have resulted in ambiguity about which country's criminal courts would have had jurisdiction.  Nuclear scare  During the time between the crash at the end of January and its recovery in early February, the biography of the business men on board caused for significant media attention and a scare that the aircraft might be transporting nuclear material. After recovery of the aircraft, no nuclear material was found. Had this been found to be true, the water supply in Switzerland, Germany and Austria and some important population centres along the river Rhine might have been at risk, hence the focus of attention. Mr Rimmele and Mr Eichler are said to have been under observation by authorities given their connection with Eastern European arms dealers and activities which included the sale and transport of low radioactive material in the past to Chinese buyers.

The toxin acts as a gating modifier on the human ether-√†-go-go- related gene (hERG) channel, a type of voltage-gated potassium channel, and as a blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels, including Nav1.2 and Nav1.8.  Sources  APETx1 is a peptide toxin purified from the venom of the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima, which produces multiple toxins.  Chemistry  APETx1 is a 42-amino acid basic peptide toxin with an isoelectric point of 9.28. The peptide contains three disulfide bridges, and it has a molecular mass of 4,551.99 Da. Furthermore, the secondary structure of the peptide consists of four-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheets. Through its folding pattern, APETx1 is classified as a member of the Defensin family. APETx1 has an 88% homology with APETx4, another Anthopleura elegantissima toxin that targets hERG channels. Moreover, APETx1 has 54% sequence homology with BDS1, which is also produced by sea anemones and targets voltage-gated potassium channels as well. Furthermore, the secondary structure of APETx1 is similar to that of BDS1, yet differs by at least one beta-turn. The scorpion venom ErgTx also targets the hERG channel. However, ErgTx has only a 20% sequence homology with APETx1.  Target  APETx1 inhibits the hERG channel, a type of voltage-gated potassium channel. APETx1 is thought to interact with three aromatic residues (Y5, Y32 and F33), two basic residues (K8 and K18) and three aliphatic residues (G7, G31 and K18) on the S3b region of the hERG channel. On the S3b helix, the amino acids on positions 514 and 518 are on the same side and are both extracellularly exposed, allowing them to bind with APETx1. This region of the S3b helix contains the voltage sensor of the hERG channel. hERG currents are inhibited by APETx1 with an IC50 of 34 nM. Among the three hERG isoforms, hERG2 is unresponsive to APETx1, whereas hERG1 and hERG3 are equally sensitive to the toxin. In addition, APETx1 blocks several mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels, including Nav1.2 with an IC50 of 31 nM, and Nav1.8 with an IC50 of 92 nM. It has no effect on invertebrate sodium channels.  Mode of action  APETx1 alters the activation of hERG channels in a voltage-dependent manner. The toxin shifts the activation curve to more positive potentials and causes a negative shift in the inactivation curve. However, like ErgTx, it preferentially binds the channel in its closed state. The fact that APETx1 binds to the voltage sensor region of hERG and that it inhibits only 80% of the hERG channels at maximum affinity suggests that APETx1 is a gating modifier. APETx1 blocks voltage-gated sodium channels by binding to neurotoxin site 1, similar to tetrodotoxin.  Toxicity  APETx1 does not induce neurotoxicity after injection into the central nervous system of mice.  As a potential drug target  As hERG channels are overexpressed in colorectal cancers, inhibition of these channels through APETx1 might lead to a reduction in tumor growth.

He worked as editor and correspondent of many Nigerian newspapers, including Leadership, The Tide, New Nigerian, The Reporter and Hotline Magazine. He also authored the official biography of the late Major-General Shehu Musa Yar‚ÄôAdua. He was pioneer editor of Blueprint Newspaper and later its editor-in chief. Sheme has been the Director of Media and Publicity at the National Open University of Nigeria since 2016 Early life and education Sheme was born in Faskari Local Government Area, Katsina State, in 1968 (though he uses 1966 in official documents). He attended Maigamji Primary School and Ruwan-Godiya Primary School, both in Funtua Local Government Area in the old Kaduna State (now in Katsina State) between 1973‚Äì1979, and finished his secondary school education at Government College, Kaduna, in 1984. He received his undergraduate degree in Mass Communication from Bayero University, Kano (BUK), in 1989. In the university, he was amongst the leading literary activists and served as both the editor-in-chief of The Parakeet, a literary journal, and editor of the Bayero Beacon, the official campus newspaper. He also served as secretary-general of the Katsina State Students Association. On graduation, he was awarded two coveted prizes, one as the Best Graduating Student in his department and the other as the overall best graduating student in the university. In 1993, after working as a journalist in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, and Kaduna, Sheme proceeded to the University of Wales in Cardiff, United Kingdom, where he received Master of Arts in Communication Studies in 1994. Sheme served as national publicity secretary of the Association of Nigerian Authors. Literary activities Sheme is one of the leading authors and literary critics in northern Nigeria. His first novel, \\"Kifin Rijiya\\" (The Ignoramus), which he wrote while still a student in Bayero University and was published in 1991, won second position in the Northern Languages Novel Writing Competition organised by the Kaduna State government. His second novel, \\"'Yartsana\\" (The Doll), won the first place prize in the maiden Bashir Karaye Prize for Hausa Writing. His other works include \\"The Malam's Potion\\"_(a collection of short stories), a travelogue on his tour of Israel and the Palestinian territories titled \\"Ilmi Mabudin Tafiya\\", a biography of the late Major-General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, and a biography of the late Alhaji Mamman Shata titled \\"Shata Ikon Allah!\\" He also edited an anthology of short stories for the Association of Nigerian Authors titled \\"Cramped Rooms and Open Spaces\\". Sheme was a central figure in the debate over Hausa romance fiction which raged in several newspapers and magazines in northern Nigeria between 1991 and 1999. The highly popular discourse, called \\"The Great Soyayya Debate\\", pitched writers, academics and literary critics such as Ibrahim Malumfashi, Abdalla Uba Adamu, Yusuf M. Adamu, Ado Ahmad Gidan Dabino, and others on the efficacy and need for the romance novels known as \\"soyayya books\\". Sheme initiated the debate as acting editor cum literary editor of Nasiha, the Hausa weekly newspaper being published by Nationhouse Press (publishers of The Reporter newspaper) in Kaduna. He took the debate to other media houses where he subsequently worked as editor or literary editor: Hotline and Rana magazines, New Nigerian, Weekly Trust, and Leadership newspaper. The debate attracted the attention of Nigerian and foreign scholars such as Professor Graham Furniss of the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London, who documented it. In the mid-'90s, Sheme served as the national publicity secretary of Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA). He was also the pioneer secretary-general of ANA in Kaduna State. Filmmaking activities Ibrahim Sheme has been linked to the robust filmmaking industry in northern Nigeria known as Kannywood. He wrote the script for many Hausa movies and even produced some. His movies include Gagarabadau (Unbeatable), Daren Farko (The First Night), and Fargaba (Fear). Sheme also wrote songs for several singers in Kannywood. His most notable activity in Kannywood, however, has been the publication of the two leading newsmagazines, Fim and Bidiyo. Fim (meaning Film) was set up by Sheme and some friends of his in March 1999, with Sheme as the publisher. He was to take over the monthly magazine as sole owner in 2002 and has been publishing it without fail since then. The magazine publishes news, interviews, gossip, etc., about stakeholders in the industry, but it later expanded its coverage to Hausa culture in general, with a section on traditional music, creative writing, and craft. The section was actually created after the death of Bahaushiya, a quarterly magazine founded by Sheme in 2006 to fill a void. The magazine Bidiyo (Video), which Sheme founded with a focus solely on the art of filmmaking, was rested after 10 editions due to low patronage because the readers preferred the scintillating gossip and lifestyle news Fim magazine provides. But Fim has suffered low sale in recent years due to the pervasive encroachment of the social media in journalism generally. From over 10,000 copies monthly sale, it has come down to a few hundred. However, there has been a marked shift by the magazine to operate its news-selling business online ‚Äì in its website and social media handles.

A similar misidentification occurred in the mid-20th century, when the Siberian elm cultivar Ulmus pumila 'Poort Bulten' was for many years commercially propagated under the name Planera aquatica or 'water elm'.Ulmus pumila 'Poort Bulten', Morton Arboretum As the leaves of osier or Salix viminalis, however, differ markedly from those of Planera aquatica, being long, thin and tapering at both ends,Step, Edward, Wayside and Woodland Trees (London, 1940), p.126 Spath's name 'Viminalis' for this elm cultivar confirms that its leaves were not Planera-like. The probable explanation for the early distribution name is that Planera was the old name for Zelkova, a close relative of elm with willow-like leaves.Gerald Wilkinson, Epitaph for the Elm (London, 1978), p.47 It is therefore unlikely that 'Viminalis' was related in any way to the 19th-century elm cultivar Ulmus 'Planeroides'. Not to be confused with Loudon's U. minor 'Viminalis'. Description The tree was said to have \\"small pendulous leaves\\", a description which suggests an Ulmus √ó hollandica rather than a wych elm cultivar (Sp√§th used U. montana for both). Beissner noted U. montana viminalis at the T√ºbingen botanical gardens, falsely named Planera aquatica, which had 'picturesque long overhanging young branches'.

Cultivation One specimen of Sp√§th's U. montana viminalis was planted at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, in 1896. Three specimens were supplied by Sp√§th to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902, and may survive in Edinburgh as it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city (viz. the Wentworth Elm); the current list of Living Accessions held in the Garden per se does not list the plant.

Two toxins from this source have been identified, one acting on sodium channels and one acting on calcium channels. Chemistry The toxin acting on Na channels has a molecular weight of 12 kDa and consists of 105 amino acids. The GPT that acts on Ca channels has a molecular weight of 19 kDa; its structure is as of yet unknown. Mode of action The 12 kDa GPT inhibits the inactivation of Na channels. This results in a maintained open state of the channel and allows for more Na influx. As a result, the action potential duration is prolonged. The maintained open state of sodium channels induces a longer-lasting action potential, which allows for persistent activation of calcium channels and more calcium influx. The prolongation of the action potential and its subsequent positive inotropic effect can be influenced by stimulus frequency; at higher frequencies (1 Hz), the effects of GPT were suppressed. Furthermore, the effects of GPT on the sodium channels depend on the membrane potential of the cell preceding GPT binding, suggesting that the effects of GPT are potential-dependent. Also, in the presence of GPT, sodium channels are activated in response to an unusually small depolarizing stimulus. The 19 kDa GPT stimulates Ca influx and its activity can be prevented in the presence of a calcium channel blocker. This suggests that GPT directly activates Ca channels or indirectly activates Ca by influencing sodium currents. GPT effects in different species Frequency-dependent effects of GPT were studied on bullfrog atrial muscle. Application of GPT on the muscle showed broadening of action potential duration and showed a positive inotropic effect. When the stimulus frequency was increased, the effects of GPT were considerably suppressed as opposed to low-frequency stimulation. Also, the action potential was prolonged when long intervals of stimulation (1-3 min), in the presence of GPT, were used. In addition, when the cell membrane was hyperpolarized, the effects of GPT also increased, suggesting a potential-dependent effect on GPT toxicity. Various GPT concentrations (10 ‚Äì 100 nM) were added to guinea-pig blood vessels, which induced a contraction of the thoracic aorta, portal vein, and mesenteric and femoral arteries via an action on the innervation of the vessels. In neuroblastoma cells, even a small depolarizing stimulus can cause activation of sodium channels in the presence of GPT. In the rabbit myocardium GPT enhances atrial contractility and induce arrhythmias at concentrations above 30 nM. The action potential duration was irreversibly prolonged, but there was no effect on the amplitude of the action potential or an effect on the resting membrane potential. In guinea-pig ventricular cells, the 12 kDa GPT prolonged the action potential by acting on sodium channels, again with no effect on action potential amplitude and the resting membrane potential. At a concentration of 1.7 ŒºM, the 19 kDa GPT induced contraction of the guinea pig ileum. This contraction was inhibited by a calcium channel blocker. In cultured chick cardiac cells the 19 kDa GPT induced an activation of calcium influx. The concentration that resulted in a half-maximum activation of calcium influx was 5.3 ŒºM. Toxicity and treatment GPT is highly toxic, with a lethal dose found in mice of 0.3-0.5 mg/kg when the 12 kDa GPT was injected intraperitoneally. Symptoms consist of hypersensitivity, paralysis of hind limbs, diarrhea, rigidity of the entire body, and GPT can lead to a blue or purple discoloration of the skin. Tetrodotoxin, a sodium channel blocker, can be administered to suppress the prolonged action potential. Ca-channel blockers (e.g. nitrendipine and desmethoxyverapamil) can be used to suppress the effects of the calcium channel toxin.

In the second half of the 19th century, the Stuckey Amish were the most liberal faction of all Amish groups.Central Conference Mennonite Church at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online  History  In 1864, Joseph Stuckey was ordained bishop of the North Danvers Church in Danvers, Illinois, an Amish church organized in 1835. In 1872, the Amish conference (Dienerversammlung) requested that Stuckey excommunicate Joseph Joder, who was a member of the congregation and who taught Universalism, but Stuckey refused what led to a division and the formation of the Stuckey Amish. Stuckey also allowed excommunicated members of other communities to join, was more relaxed in dress standards, advocated integration with the outside society and espoused Universalism and the belief that God would save all of humanity regardless of religious affiliation.Central Conference Mennonite Church at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online. In the beginning only two small congregations at Meadows and Washington, Illinois, which were under Stuckey's oversight, joined him, but soon his following grew through new congregations that were organized in other places and one at Topeka, Indiana (1902), which left the old church there and joined Stuckey's group.Central Conference Mennonite Church at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online.

She previously worked with Times Now and The New Indian Express.  Career  Dhanya started her career by working for Kerala's first 24-hour news channel India Vision in 2003. In 2004, she moved to New Indian Express in Chennai. She subsequently moved to working for Times Now as a reporter in 2005 and went on to become its bureau chief of South India. Along with her husband Vignesh Vellore and Chitra Subramaniam, she then went on to co-found The News Minute, a digital news website focussing on the news coverage of the southern states of India in 2014. Dhanya is also a member of The Network for Women in Media, India.  Facing violence as a woman journalist  Dhanya has often had to face online violence on account of her work. In 2017, she faced a barrage of abuse on Twitter ‚Äî all for expressing an opinion about Sura, a film she did not like. Her opinion about a Tamil film starring Vijay, a popular Tamil actor, angered his fans. Rajendran‚Äôs phone crashed after it couldn‚Äôt handle close to 31,000 tweets spread across a couple of minutes. #PublicityBeepDhanya‚Äîa hashtag was created just to abuse Rajendran‚Äî started trending. And choicest of abuses laden with sexual harassment followed. Dhanya filed a complaint with the cyber crime branch of the Chennai police. In response an FIR was filed under IPC sections 354 D (stalking), 506(1) (criminal intimidation), 507 (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication), 509 (insulting the modesty of women), section 67 of IT Act (publishing obscene material), section 4 of TN Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act, and section 6 of the Indecent Representation of Women Act. M. K. Stalin, the leader of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam also a issued a statement against the misogynistic violence. Despite deleting the original tweet, the violence continued. The Network for Women in Media, India and International Federation of Journalists issued statements in support of Dhanya and condemned the online violence she had to face. Finally actor Vijay issued a statement asking his fans to stop the online violence against Dhanya. The Chennai police investigated Ramkumar, one of the accused, a Vijay fan and a Tamil Nadu resident in connection with her abuse. He apologised for his deed after the police met his mother and the denial of his bail by the Madras High Court. When she reported about godman Swami Nityananda being accused of sexual abuse, she had to face a lot of online sexual abuse on social media from the followers of Nithyananda's cult. In response to her reportage, the followers made several news videos by calling her choicest of abuses including presstitute, anti-national among others. Dhanya has been vocal about violence faced by women journalists on the field. Immediately after former chief minister of Tamil Nadu J Jayalalitha's death, she wrote a piece about how she was molested by one of her security men when she was out to do stories around election coverage. She reacted strongly against the violence faced by women journalists reporting about the entry of women in Sabarimala. In 2019, she issued a strong statement in support of women journalists protesting against the violence of the secretary of the Thiruvananthapuram Press Club against a woman journalist by saying: ‚ÄúIf you touch one of us, we will retaliate. No longer your fiefdom.‚Äù She has also come out in support of women sharing their stories during the Me too movement in India by consistently featuring several stories about the issue and also speaking out about it.  Against sensationalism  Dhanya has also come out against sensationalism in news media by reflecting upon her own experiences as a journalist and the pressures that compel journalists to resort to digging out voyeuristic information in cases related to 'sexual abuse'. She has said said that journalists should exercise restraint and shouldn't publish graphic details of a sexual crime since it is not of use to anyone, least of all to the victim or the survivor.  Awards and accolades  Dhanya has amassed several awards in her career. She was named as one of India‚Äôs best entrepreneurs in Fortune magazine‚Äôs 40 under 40 list in 2018.

It seeks the welfare of the state and a fair society for all by engaging issues of common interest to build the common good. This is Christian theology that talks with society not just to society. This is done by presenting the Christian position in a way that can be publicly understood and thereby open to public debate and critical enquiry.  Key developments  The term \\"public theology\\" was first coined by Martin Marty to contrast against civil religion. Civil religion looks more generally at religion in relation to the state, whereas public theology is rooted in a Christian standpoint and identity as it considers its contributions to the society and the state. David Tracy asked what the \\"public\\" in \\"public theology\\" meant. He identifies three publics that public theology should try to engage in dialogue with: the society, the academy and the church. He suggests that, given these publics, the language and rationale used should be openly accessible by all and not couched in theologically elitist terms. Since Tracy identified these three publics, others have suggested the addition of other \\"publics\\" such as economics, law, the market, media, and other religious communities. Harold Breitenberg suggests that most literature on public theology falls into one of three classes. Firstly, there are studies on key public theologians and how they understand the topic. Secondly, there are discussions on the nature and the shape of public theology. Lastly, there is \\"constructive public theology\\" which is the actual doing of public theology. The first two aim at developing public theology as a field of study while the last one is the practical application of it. Some notable figures in this field are Dietrich Bonhoeffer, William Temple, Martin Luther King Jr., Desmond Tutu, J√ºrgen Moltmann, Ronald Thiemann, Dorothee Soelle, John Courtney Murray, Reinhold Niebuhr, Duncan Forrester, Max Stackhouse, and Sebastian C. H. Kim.  Common traits  While there is no authoritative definition or corpus of books on public theology, there are several common traits which are observable in varying degrees. Katie Day and Sebastian Kim note six common \\"marks\\" of public theology. Firstly, public theology is often incarnational. It is not confined to the church but meant to be relevant to people outside of it as well. It is meant to be realistic and concerned with all aspects of societal life. Secondly, there is often discussion over which public(s) to engage and the nature of the public sphere. Thirdly, it is interdisciplinary because it draws on other fields of study in order to be more relevant to society. Fourthly, public theology always involves dialogue and critique from both the church itself and society as well. Fifthly, it has a global perspective because many issues affect countries across borders, such as immigration, climate change, refugees, etc. Lastly, public theology is performed, not just printed in books. This field of theology is not theorized first then applied, but it is a theology that develops and evolves while being expressed in society.  Compared with political theology  Public theology and political theology share many common points. They have overlapping concerns for social justice and Christian engagement in the public and political sphere. They also share similar concerns that the Christian faith is more than individual piety. It has a role to play in building societal peace, justice, and the common good. However, they differ in many ways as well. Political theology tends to be more radical in its pursuit for societal transformation, sometimes compelled by a sense of crisis. Public theology, on the other hand, is more moderate. It seeks to bring change gradually through social analysis, public dialogue, and shaping the moral fabric of society. So political theology tends to be more revolutionary while public theology is more reformative. Political theology is directed more towards the government or the state, whereas public theology is more towards civil society. This is because political theology is more concerned with a just political system whereas public theology is more concerned for a just society for everyone, open dialogue, and the building a common ground.  Criticism  A common critique of public theology is the overly broad range of issues it is concerned with. Because it seeks to engage in all issues that concern the society, public theology may find itself spread too thin across these issues. As a result, it may fail to engage the issues with sufficient depth and academic rigour because it lacks the necessary subject matter expertise. This overt broadness may also cause public theology to lack a focused approach and method because each issue may require a different methodology. Another critique public theology faces is the inherent difficulty in retaining its Christian distinctiveness while being publicly relevant. Too much weight in either direction may cause it to be irrelevant to the public or bearing no distinct Christian witness. The tension may be ideal in theory, but difficult to achieve in reality.

Ueda (April 17, 1929 - June 13, 2020) was a retired American ice drilling engineer. Ueda was born and raised in the Puyallup Valley in Washington. His parents were farm laborers, and were of Japanese descent. The Ueda family was interned in Idaho's Minidoka War Relocation Center for three years, beginning in the summer of 1942, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He was drafted into the Army in 1951 for two years, and attended the University of Illinois, first at Navy Pier and then at Champaign-Urbana, graduating as a mechanical engineer in 1958. Later that year he was hired by Lyle Hansen to work at the Snow, Ice, and Permafrost Research Establishment (SIPRE).Shoemaker (2002), pp. 1‚Äì6. Ueda worked on the development of a thermal drill for SIPRE, initially under Fred Pollack; when Pollack left Ueda took over the project. It was tested in Greenland, at Camp Tuto and Camp Century. in the later 1950s and early 1960s, reaching over 500 feet in 1961, over 700 feet depth in 1962, and almost 900 feet in 1963. At that point they began working on adapting a cable-suspended electromechanical drill, designed by Armais Arutunoff for mineral drilling, to be used in ice. A secondhand drill was acquired in 1963, and in 1964, when the thermal drill reached 1800 feet, they switched to using the electromechanical drill, and it worked well. After two more seasons of drilling it finally reached bedrock at about 4,550 ft. Ueda later described it as \\"the most satisfying moment of my life, or of my career\\".Shoemaker (2002), pp. 9‚Äì26. In 1966 and 1967 he was at Byrd Station in the Antarctic, where the drill was used to reach 7102 feet at bedrock. After this he worked on building drills for other organizations, including Ohio State and the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE). He worked on the Ross Ice Shelf Project with John Rand in the 1970s, and then worked on the DYE sites in Greenland. He retired from SIPRE (by this time renamed to Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory) in 1987, and worked for the Polar Ice Coring Office (PICO) for a while as technical director of operations, working for John Kelle. In 1989 he visited Greenland to work on the GISP 2 program.Shoemaker (2002), pp. 27‚Äì46. Ueda died of natural causes in 2020.

The Waeringopteridae is the only family classified as part of the superfamily Waeringopteroidea, which in turn is classified within the infraorder Diploperculata in the suborder Eurypterina. The earliest known member of the group, Orcanopterus, has been recovered from deposits of Katian (Late Ordovician) age and the latest known surviving member, Grossopterus, has been recovered from deposits of Siegenian (Early Devonian) age. The name Waeringopteridae is derived from the type genus Waeringopterus, which is named in honor of eurypterid researcher Erik N. Kjellesvig-Waering. Waeringopterid fossils are very rare and the family only contains five known species classified in three different genera (Waeringopterus, Orcanopterus and Grossopterus). Four of these species are from the ancient continent of Laurentia, with the only species known from outside of it being a Devonian species recovered from Germany. It is thus considered likely that the group originated in Laurentia before spreading to Germany during the Devonian. As the fossil record of the group is extremely poor, little is known of the morphology of the taxa within the group. Although confirmed by phylogenetic analyses as monophyletic, and routinely used within eurypterid taxonomy,Dunlop, J. A., Penney, D. & Jekel, D. 2015. A summary list of fossil spiders and their relatives. In World Spider Catalog. Natural History Museum Bern, online at http://wsc.nmbe.ch, version 16.0 http://www.wsc.nmbe.ch/resources/fossils/Fossils16.0.pdf (PDF). \\"Waeringopteroidea\\" and \\"Waeringopteridae\\" are as of yet not formally published clades, the names instead deriving from a 2004 thesis by O. Erik Tetlie. Some researchers refer to the group more formally as the \\"waeringopteroid clade\\" rather than as the superfamily \\"Waeringopteroidea\\", pending a formal publication.  Description  Fossil carapaces of Waeringopterus. Although waeringopterid fossils remain rare and in most cases fragmentary and very little concrete information on the group can confidently be established due to the poor fossil record, the waeringopterid eurypterids are joined together by a handful of known features shared by all genera within the group. Like all other chelicerates, and other arthropods in general, waeringopterid eurypterids possessed segmented bodies and jointed appendages (limbs) covered in a cuticle composed of proteins and chitin. The chelicerate body is divided into two tagmata (sections); the frontal prosoma (head) and posterior opisthosoma (abdomen). In the waeringopterids, the fifth pair of appendages were spiniferous. The telson (the posteriormost segment of the body) was xiphous (long and pointed). The eyes of waeringopterid eurypterids were located close to the marginal rim of the carapace (the \\"head\\" plate). The waeringopterids were almost all small eurypterids. Waeringopterus cumberlandicus reached 15 cm (5.9 in) in length, while Grossopterus overathi reached 30 cm (11.8 in). Orcanopterus manitoulinensis reached 60 cm (23.6 in) in length. Though this is relatively long in comparison to modern arthropods, other members of Diploperculata, such as the pterygotids or the carcinosomatids, reached much larger sizes, surpassing two meters.Lamsdell, James C.; Braddy, Simon J. (2009-10-14). \\"Cope's Rule and Romer's theory: patterns of diversity and gigantism in eurypterids and Palaeozoic vertebrates\\". Biology Letters: rsbl20090700. . . . Supplementary information  Classification  The Waeringopteridae is the only family within the superfamily Waeringopteroidea and contains the genera Grossopterus, Orcanopterus and Waeringopterus. The cladogram below presents the inferred phylogenetic positions of most of the genera included in the three most derived superfamilies of the Eurypterina suborder of eurypterids (Adelophthalmoidea, Pterygotioidea and the waeringopteroids), as inferred by O. Erik Tetlie and Markus Poschmann in 2008, based on the results of a 2008 analysis specifically pertaining to the Adelophthalmoidea and a preceding 2004 analysis. \\"Waeringopteridae\\" and the superfamily that includes it, \\"Waeringopteroidea\\" (named after eurypterid researcher Erik N. Kjellesvig- Waering), are not formally published clades. The names derive from a 2004 thesis by O. Erik Tetlie and are as such not actually technically valid names. Nevertheless, as phylogenetic analyses confirms the grouping as monophyletic and the names supply an easy way to refer to the group, they remain routinely used within studies centered around eurypterid taxonomy. In these studies, the names are usually within quotation marks and/or are noted to not be properly valid names that derive from a thesis. The group is also sometimes referred to as the \\"waeringopteroid clade\\" rather than as the \\"Waeringopteroidea\\" within studies to differentiate it from the properly described superfamilies, pending the formal publication of Waeringopteroidea.  Distribution and paleobiogeography  Out of the five known waeringopterid species, four are from the fossil deposits in areas that were part of the ancient continent of Laurentia. Only the last known surviving species, Grossopterus overathi, from the Devonian of Germany, is known from outside of Laurentia and it is thus assumed that the group originated in Laurentia before they spread to modern- day Germany in the Devonian. Further fossil finds are required to properly study the distribution and evolutionary history of the group. The temporal range of the group extends from the Late Ordovician (Orcanopterus) to the Early Devonian (Grossopterus).

In modern times, it is usually reckoned around the 14th of April. Origins As most countries and cultures of South and Southeast Asia lie within the Indian cultural sphere, the development of their traditional calendars have been strongly influenced by some form of the Hindu calendar. As in many other calendars, the New Year was based on the northern hemisphere vernal equinox (the beginning of spring). However, the Hindu calendar year was based on the sidereal year (i.e. the movement of the sun relative to the stars), while the Western Gregorian calendar is based on the tropical year (the cycle of seasons). In ancient times, the sun's entry into Aries coincided with the equinox. However, due to the earth's axial precession, the sidereal year is slightly longer than the tropical year, causing the dates to gradually drift apart. Today, the sun's entry into Aries occurs around 18 April, according to astronomical definitions. Some traditional calendars are still marked by the sun's actual movements while others have since been fixed to the Gregorian calendar. The sun's entry into Aries is known as ' in Sanskrit, and is observed as Mesha Sankranti in Indian cultures. Celebrations The specific New Year observances include: * In South Asia: ** In India: *** Bohag Bihu in Assam *** Pana Sankranti in Odisha *** Sangken in Arunachal Pradesh and parts of Assam *** Puthandu or Tamil New Year in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry *** Vishu in Kerala *** Bisu in Tulu Nadu region of Karnataka and Kerala ** Bisket Jatra in Bhaktapur, Dhapasi and Tokha in Nepal ** Maithili New Year in the Mithila region of India and Nepal ** Pahela Baishakh or Bengali New Year in Bangladesh, and West Bengal and Tripura in India ** Puthandu or Tamil New Year in Sri Lanka and elsewhere ** Aluth Avurudda or Sinhalese New Year in Sri Lanka ** Vaisakhi or Punjabi New Year, in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan * In Southeast Asia: ** Thingyan in Burma ** Choul Chnam Thmey in Cambodia ** Pi Mai in Laos ** Songkran in Thailand * In East Asia: ** Water- Sprinkling Festival, celebrated by the Dai people in Sipsongpanna in Yunnan, China See also *Indian New Year's days *Water Festival *Sidereal and tropical astrology References New Year celebrations April observances South Asian culture Southeast Asian culture ","title":"South and Southeast Asian solar New Year"},{"id":"55486498","text":"Angela Buxton and Althea Gibson were the defending champions, but Buxton did not compete.

He served as a member of the Cypriot Legislative Council (1901‚Äì1911), mayor of Limassol (1908‚Äì1912) and Limassol‚ÄìPaphos MP (1908‚Äì1912). On 7 November 1912, he voluntarily enlisted in Greek army as private which at the time was fighting in the First Balkan War. He was killed in action on 6 December. His prewar activism on behalf of the cause of Enosis and the circumstances surrounding his death made him one of the most important figures of Greek Cypriot nationalism. Early life A statue of Sozos in Limassol. Sozos' office. Christodoulos Sozos was born in Limassol on 10 March 1872. His father and grandfather had fought as volunteers in the Cretan Revolt (1866‚Äì1869) and the Greek War of Independence respectively. He studied law at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and worked as a lawyer before the beginning of his political career. He served as member of the Cypriot Legislative Council from 1901 until 1911, and represented Limassol‚ÄìPaphos constituency as an MP during the same period. In April 1903, he exploited the absence of a single Turkish Cypriot member of the council to pass a resolution which declared that the people of Cyprus aspired to reunite with their motherland (Greece). He also served as the mayor of Limassol from 1908 until his death, his most notable achievements being the erection of the city's first public garden as well as the electrification of the street lighting, the first such occasion in Cyprus. Upon returning from his visit to Great Britain in June 1912, he became convinced that the only way for the Enosis between Cyprus and Greece was an intermediate step of autonomous rule. His stance drew sharp criticism from his political rival Nikolaos Katalanos who described the supporters of autonomy as madmen and traitors. Balkan War Limassol Balkan Wars Memorial. Sozos' name is inscribed at the top. At the outbreak of the First Balkan War, Cyprus was nominally a part of the Ottoman Empire, while in fact being administered by the British Empire as agreed in the Cyprus Convention of 1878. On 17 October 1912, Sozos departed from Limassol as part of a small unit of the Cypriot Red Cross which headed to Athens in order to assist the Greek army which at the time fought against the Ottomans. His wife Ermioni Sozou, his 4-year-old son Zinon and 7 sisters were not informed about his decision as he feared that they would not allow him to leave. The ship made stops at Alexandria and Patras before arriving to its final destination on 23 October. On 7 November, he took part in an hour long official meeting with the Greek prime minister Eleutherios Venizelos. Venizelos became emotional and eventually gave in to his pleas, allowing him and Larnaca MP Evaggelos Hajioannou to enlist in the 1st Infantry Regiment of the 2nd Infantry Division as privates. On 1 November his unit reached Thessaloniki, on 13 November he was dispatched to Agioi Saranta. He fought at Delvino before taking part in the Battle of Bizani. On 6 December, Sozos was killed in action on the Profitis Ilias height, Manoliasa, outside Bizani. Despite multiple search missions his body was never recovered. News of his death reached Cyprus in the second half of December. His wife Ermioni received hundreds of telegrams offering condolences from both Cyprus and abroad, among them was one from the British High Commissioner to Cyprus Hamilton Goold-Adams. Greek schools and courts suspended their activities, a court in Nicosia also raised a flag in honor of Sozos thus breaking the law as Britain maintained a neutral stance in the conflict. Ironically Nikolaos Katalanos delivered a speech during Sozos' mnemosynon where he described him as a hyperpatriot. Mnemosyna were also held in dozens of villages across Cyprus, as well as in Cypriot communities in Athens, Egypt and Sudan. Greek Cypriot newspapers were swept with nationalist fervor comparing Sozos with Pavlos Melas. Goold-Adams and his successor as British High Commissioner to Cyprus John Eugene Clauson, praised Sozos in their last and first addresses respectively. A photo of Sozos was placed in the Hellenic Parliament. Streets were named after Sozos in Limassol and Ioannina, a statue honoring Sozos was also erected in the former. Sozos' death left a lasting mark on the Enosis movement, being one of its most important events before the 1931 Cyprus revolt.

It was designed by Edmund Blacket, Alexander Dawson and James Barnet and built from 1854 to 1886. It is also known as Police Station & Law Courts (former) and Traffic Court. The property is owned by the Department of Justice, a department of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Pre 1856 In 1851 the Governor General approved the Colonial Architect's plan for a new Water Police Office. By November the site had been chosen. In 1853 work began on quarrying the sandstone at Bennelong Point for the Water Police Office but work was delayed because of high prices and a labour shortage caused by the gold rushes. A sum of was allocated in 1854 for the construction of the Water Police Station on Phillip Street to the south of the Water Police Office. The new Water Police Office on the eastern side of Circular Quay was completed. The building, designed by Edmund Blacket, consisted of a main court and four adjoining offices. In April the buildings were occupied by the Water Police Magistrate, Hutchinson Hothersal Brown, and court staff consisting of a Clerk of Petty Sessions and a second clerk. Cases heard in the court related to the workings of the Harbour Regulations Act and the Act for Establishing a Water Police. In May permission was granted for the Steam Navigation and Pilot Boards to take possession of one room. The Water Police moved from Cadman's Wharf to the Water Police Station located in Phillip Street to the south of the Water Police Office. It was designed by Colonial Architect Alexander Dawson and construction commenced in 1857. The building consisted of a ground floor with Charge Room, adjoining offices, cells to the rear, a kitchen, store room and exercise yard. Upstairs was a barracks providing accommodation for four water policemen and their families. It also contained a kitchen and wash house. The original police station design was based on stations at Darlinghurst, Newtown and Balmain. The building was intended to accommodate six cells and a lock-up keeper. However, due to financial constraints and delays caused by labour shortages during the Gold Rush period, the station was completed as a modest two storey building. The second court, designed by Colonial Architect James Barnet, was completed during this period. It consisted of a court room and two Magistrates Offices at the rear. While it functioned as a Summons Court hearing cases of petty crime, the Blacket Court became a Charge Court. This period witnessed a growth of police and court operations. The buildings were affected by a number of alterations and additions caused by changes to the nature of the courts and the business they attracted. In 1913 the Water Police who lived at the station were removed to their new accommodation on the north-western side of the Quay at Dawes Point, providing two locations for their activities. The station became known as the Phillip Street Police Station from this time although it was still often referred to as the Water Police Station. The activities of the station were incorporated more fully into the Metropolitan Policing District, becoming the head station for Number 4 Division by 1933. It seems that the Water Police held the two locations at least until this time, when the split between the metropolitan (essentially foot) duties associated with the Station and the Water Patrol had become more definite. However, the adjacent court continued to be referred to as the Water Bench until late 1940. In 1917 the Police Traffic Branch moved into offices at the Water Police Court and remained there until 1924. In 1918 the Water Police Court closed for alterations and was reopened in 1924. By 1924 special arrangements had been made for hearing traffic offences in the Water Police Court in addition to those concerning shipping, military trainees and children. From 1926 the courts became known as Traffic Courts 1 and 2 for hearing all traffic and parking offences in the Sydney district. They also continued to hear cases relevant to shipping and cases arising from Water Police activity. The courts were vacated by court staff, providing valuable space for the police in the adjoining station in late 1979. ;Court functions, 1890-1924 *1890s - Licensing Court *1917-1924 - Traffic Office *1918 - Fair Rents Court *1919-1933 - Small Debts Court *1924-1980 - Traffic Court ;Other occupants of Water Police Courts, 1890-1918Historic Houses Trust 1990:15-17 & Section 14 *1890-1933 - Clerk of petty Sessions and Chamber Magistrate *1890-1897 - Stipendiary Magistrate *1890-1918 - Chief Clerk *1890-1904 - Accountant *1890-1902 - Clerks *1891-1902 - Bailiff of the Small Debts Court *1894-1902 - Messenger *1914-1918 - Chief Industrial Magistrate The site is run by Sydney Living Museums (formerly the Historic Houses Trust of NSW) as a Police & Justice museum.

The museum buildings  These are two 19th century courthouses and a police station built on the corner of Phillip and Albert Streets at the eastern end of Circular Quay for use by the Sydney Water Police, the Water Police Magistrate and the metropolitan police. *1856 - Court House - 4 Phillip Street *1858 - Police Station - 8 Phillip Street *1886 - Court House - 6 Phillip StreetHistoric Houses Trust 1990:1 ;The 1856 Blacket Court building area The Blacket Court building area is a single storey classic revival sandstone building with an arched colonnaded portico roofed with a Doric pediment. The facades comprises timber framed windows and doors with the main entrance to the northern wall enclosed with curved timber and glass walling. The Court House consists of five smaller roof areas. These include the main gabled or pedimented roof area to the court room, with two lower hipped roof areas on each side of the main court room area. The building area also includes a flat roof area to the rear or south end of the court which extends over a sandstone paved corridor between the Blacket Court Building (1856) and the Barnet Court Building (1886). The western wing has a lean-to verandah roof extending along the Phillip Street facade. The main gabled ended roof and the two hipped roof areas are covered in slate with lead hip and ridge flashings. The flat roof area at the rear is covered in copper and contains three glazed skylights with steel grilles. The western lean-to verandah roof is covered with corrugated steel \\"colourbond\\" roofing. There are four chimneys located on the main courtroom roof area. ;The 1886 Barnet Court building area The Barnet Court building area is a single storey sandstone building erected at the rear of the Blacket Court Room as an extension. It consists of an arched colonnaded portico, also roofed with a pediment to match the detail of the earlier Blacket Court Building. The main front entrance portico is enclosed with a curved timber and glass walling, The main roof area is gabled with slate roofing and the stair roof comprises a lean-to corrugated steel \\"colourbond\\" roof sheeting. ;The 1858 Police Station Area The Police Station Area is a two- storey Pyrmont sandstone building of simple Classical style with a pediment over the central section of the front facade. It has a \\"T\\" shaped hipped roof with lead ridge and flashings and slate tiles. The windows are timber framed. The front facade to Phillip Street has a metal pike fence and gate on a low sandstone wall extending the full extent of the facade.Heritage Group 1995:2-6 Museum collection The collection is general and largely police-based in content. Its nucleus is formed from the 1910 Police Museum teaching collection of criminal implements. It contains few objects relating to the specific theme of the Water Police but covers a broader cross-section of policing activities and law related themes. The collection includes historical artefacts, photographs and documents. It is particularly strong in firearms of the colonial period and forensic evidence from famous crimes.Historic Houses Trust 1990: 1&23  Condition  As at 18 September 1997, physical condition is good.

Architecturally and culturally they evoke a system of social control and relate to a specific power relationship.Historic HousesTrust 1990:23 The site's proximity to the waters of Sydney Cove; its close and long continuing association with the colony and its classical architectural syntax and indeed, endearingly human scale, provides an important foil to multi-storeyed buildings and Circular Quay.NSW Public Works 1982. Justice and Police Museum was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The buildings were the headquarters of the Water Police, one of the earliest policing bodies in New South Wales, whose activities were closely related to Sydney's growth as a maritime and commercial centre. The complex of buildings reflects the work of four government architects over 48 years. The buildings have a continuous association with different law and policing functions in the inner metropolitan district. In their present form they demonstrate the architectural response to demands imposed by policing trends in the 19th century.Historic Houses Trust 1990:25 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The buildings form part of a historic precinct within the Sydney Cove area, conspicuous for its sandstone buildings which include significant sites relating to the foundation of colonial government and administration. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Justice and Police Museum holds the only public collection of artefacts in NSW relating to the history of crime, law and policing. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The reconstruction as of of the court and police station provide a unique opportunity to demonstrate the working relationship between the two in an experiential and interactive context and manner. The museum is unique among Sydney's museums in that it can communicate the activities of the law and the police today to the public. While it may disseminate information about the aims and methods of these institutions it should maintain an independent role as a commentator and interpreter.

She is known for her research in the mediation of human suffering on mass and digital media, but also in interpretative methodologies in social research, particularly discourse, visual and multi-modal analysis.  Career  Chouliaraki received her bachelors in philosophy at the University of Athens, and both her MA and PhD in Linguistics from Lancaster University. Chouliaraki‚Äôs research has focused on four domains where suffering appears as a problem of communication: disaster news, humanitarian campaigns and celebrity advocacy, war & conflict reporting, and migration. The International Journal of Communication describes Chouliaraki‚Äôs scholarly work as a ‚Äúplea for a critical observation and profound empirical analysis of the discursive reproduction of injustice, symbolic inequalities, and representational hierarchies in the mediation of suffering‚Äù Her publications include 'Discourse in Late Modernity' (1999), ‚ÄòThe Spectatorship of Suffering' (2006), ‚ÄòThe Soft Power of War' (ed., 2008), ‚ÄòMedia, Organizations, Identity' (2009), ‚ÄòSelf-mediation. New Media, Citizenship and Civic Selves‚Äô (ed. 2012) and ‚ÄòThe Ironic Spectator: Solidarity in the Age of Post-humanitarianism' (2013) as well as sixty articles in peer- reviewed journals and edited volumes. Her work is widely cited and has been published in French, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Danish, Greek and (currently) in Chinese. She is the recipient of three international awards for her articles and books. In 2014, Chouliaraki in Media Ethics & Humanitarianism discussed with Prof. Conor Gearty 'the moral implications of the use of celebrities by humanitarian organisations' in the YouTube video debates Gearty Grilling. She is currently board member of the journals ‚ÄòDiscourse and Society‚Äô; ‚ÄòVisual Communication‚Äô; ‚ÄòSocial Semiotics‚Äô; ‚ÄòCritical Discourse Studies‚Äô; ‚ÄôCrime, Media, Culture‚Äô; ‚ÄòJournal of Language and Politics‚Äô, ‚ÄôJOMEC Journal‚Äô, ‚ÄôPopular Communication‚Äô, ‚ÄôDigital Journalism‚Äô. She has been a judge at The Guardian‚Äôs International Development Competition, 2012 and 2013. Chouliaraki has lectured for major NGOs, such as Amnesty International (UK, Finland) and Doctors without Borders (Germany) on the development of their communication agendas and strategies. Contributions  Aestheticization of war and war reporting  In 'The aestheticization of suffering on television', Chouliaraki's analyzes \\" war footage in order to trace the ways in which the tension between presenting airwar as an 'objective' piece of news and as an instance of intense human suffering is resolved in television's strategies of mediation\\". Specifically, Chouliaraki argues that the bombardment of Baghdad in 2003 during the Iraq war was filmed in long-shot and presented in a quasiliterary narrative that capitalized on an aesthetics of horror, on sublime spectacle (Boltanski). She says that the \\"aestheticization of suffering on television is thus produced by a visual and linguistic complex that eliminates the human pain aspect of suffering, whilst retaining the phantasmagoric effects of a tableau vivant\\", producing an \\"aestheticization of suffering [that] manages simultaneously to preserve an aura of objectivity and impartiality, and to take a pro-war side in the war footage\\". Chouliaraki's research on war reporting focuses on mobile phone footage from post-Arab Spring conflict zones, exploring how major news platforms accommodate Twitter, amateur videos and other genres, such as selfies, in their news stories. Her argument is that war journalism has shifted from reporting, that is providing information on the development of military operations, to witnessing, that is focusing on civilian suffering and death.  Mediation of Solidarity  In her book The Ironic Spectator. Solidarity in the age of post-humanitarianism, Chouliaraki explored how solidarity activism has changed in the course of the past fifty years. Looking into NGO appeals, rock concerts, celebrity advocacy and post-television disaster news, she demonstrates how major institutional (the commercialisation of the aid and development field), technological (the rise of new media) and political (the fall of grand narratives) transformations have also changed the ways we are invited to act on distant others who need our support. When famine is described through our own experience of dieting, solidarity with Africa translates into buying Christmas presents from a charity website and supporting a cause is about following our favourite celebrity on Twitter, Chouliaraki argues, then solidarity is less about vulnerable others and more about 'us'. This is what she calls post- humanitarian solidarity, a form of solidarity that is no longer about conviction but choice, not vision but lifestyle, not the needs of others but our own - turning us into the ironic spectators of other people's suffering.  Mediation of Migration  This two-year research project, co-led by Chouliaraki, focused on the 2015 migration crisis in Europe and provided an integrated overview of its digital mediations in press and on the ground. The project focused both on online news headlines in eight European countries in the period July‚ÄìDecember 2015; and on the use of digital media on the ground, in one of the Greek border islands, where migrants first arrived. In this double focus, the project is the first one to approach the mediation of the migration crisis in terms of both its narrative border (content analysis of online press in terms of headline language and images) and its territorial border (participant observation on Chios island that maps out the actors and uses of social media and other digital equipment for purposes on migrant reception).  Discourse Theory and Analysis  Chouliaraki is co-author of 'Discourse in Late Modernity. Rethinking Critical Discourse Analysis' (with Norman Fairclough EUP, 1999), an agenda-setting volume for Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). The argument of the book is that discourse is neither code nor structure but practice, an inherent dimension of social action in the world. Starting from this premise, it further argues that CDA is strongly positioned to address empirical research and theory-building across the social sciences, particularly research and theory on the semiotic/linguistic aspects of the social world. It situates critical discourse analysis as a form of critical social research in relation to diverse perspectives from the philosophy of science to social theory and from political science to sociology and linguistics. Further work of Chouliaraki on Critical Discourse Analysis explores discourse as practice through a discussion of three different versions of constructivist epistemologies and discusses how we can research the social world when we do not believe in 'objective' reality.

He became an activist at an early age, and was forced into exile for his activities during the Paris Commune. After returning to France he was arrested twice for his activism before being elected to the legislature for two terms. At first enthusiastic, he became disillusioned and declined to run for reelection in 1898. He returned to porcelain making, and died in obscurity. Early years (1853‚Äì84) Eug√®ne Baudin was born on 29 August 1853 in Vierzon, Cher. He was the son of a porcelain worker who had a large family. He attended the commune's school until he was ten years old, then became an apprentice at the porcelain factory of M. Bazille in Vierzon. While very young he was influenced by the views of Louis Auguste Blanqui and became a revolutionary socialist. While 17 years old he fought against the official candidate in the 1869 legislative elections. After the election he was condemned to two months in prison for contempt of the emperor. After Baudin had completed his sentence his employer refused to rehire him. He moved to Paris, where he joined the First International and participated in the events of 4 September 1870 when the Government of National Defense was proclaimed. He enlisted on 7 September 1870 and served in the Francs-tireurs and then the artillery during the Siege of Paris. After the siege he returned to Vierzon. When he heard that troops from Bourges would be going through Vierzon to fight people of Limousin who had declared for the Commune, Baudin assembled several hundred local people to stop them. The next day he led a dozen friends to Paris, where he joined the Commune, fought at Fort d'Issy and was made an officer. After the failure of the Commune Baudin was condemned in absentia. He went into exile with √âdouard Vaillant, first in Switzerland, then in Germany and England. In England he obtained a job as a porcelain worker and married. He could not return to France until the amnesty of 1881. Local politics (1881‚Äì89) Baudin returned to France in 1881. In 1884 he was elected municipal councilor for Vierzon-Ville and for Vierzon-Village. He chose to represent Vierzon-Ville. In 1885 he ran for election to the legislature as socialist candidate on the list of F√©lix Pyat-Vaillant, and won 17,000 votes, but was defeated. That year he was elected to the General Council of Cher for the canton of La Guerche. When strikes broke out in Vierzon, particularly at the Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de mat√©riel agricole, Baudin strongly supported the workers. He was arrested on 3 October 1885 for having resisted a gendarme who, according to Baudin's friends, was mistreating a woman. The tribunal at Bourges condemned Baudin to two months in prison and the loss of his civil rights for five years. On appeal the judgement was confirmed. His election to the General Council was annulled due to his conviction. After 92 days in prison Baudin returned to Vierzon, and three days later he was reelected councilor. The council made him deputy mayor. Baudin decided to sit in the General Council of Cher. By order of the Prefect he was asked to leave, but refused. Policemen led by a commissioner entered the General Council room and expelled him. Three months later he was reelected to the General Council for La Guerch in the first round, with his expenses covered by subscriptions from twenty deputies and from his friend. His election was again annulled due to his conviction. He was again physically expelled from the council, and was finally obliged to capitulate and refrain from running in new elections due to lack of money. By his account he continued to advise citizens to support the republic and continued to defend workers against employers in the courts. His workshop was filled with citizens who came to ask his advice. Deputy: first term (1889‚Äì93) The Socialist Congress ask Baudin to run in the 1889 legislative elections as its candidate in the 2nd constituency of Bourges or the 2nd constituency of Saint-Amand. He chose Bourges, and ran as a Blanquist, but belonged to the section of the socialists who refused to support Boulangism. The elections of 22 September 1889 were inconclusive, but Baudin was elected on the second ballot on 6 October 1889. He was one of two successes for the Marxists claimed by Paul Lafargue, the other being Christophe Thivrier, an ex-miner and municipal councillor for Commentry who had campaigned as a Boulangist and joined the Workers' Party after being elected. However, Friedrich Engels saw the elections as a success, counting Baudin, Thivrier and F√©lix Lachize as Marxists, and considering that Gustave Paul Cluseret and Ernest Ferroul were \\"bound to cast in their lot with the first three.\\" Contributors to Millerand's socialist journal La Petite R√©publique. Baudin is 3rd row down,2nd from the left During this session of parliament Baudin was very active in all socialist demonstrations. On 19 November 1889 Baudin, Joseph Ferroul, Antide Boyer and Valentin Couturier proposed that the mines should be nationalized, and demands for nationalization of regulation grew as strikes spread across France. From 1890 to 1892 Baudin participated in the labour action of the logging unions. He tabled two bills, one on working conditions in match factories, and the other on the intervention of the army between capital and labour. He voted for a credit of 1,600,000 francs for the secret funds of the S√ªret√© g√©n√©rale, but protested against the use of secret funds to pay agents provocateurs who joined the socialist party. In the discussion over the 1890 accident in the Villeboeuf mine in Saint-√âtienne he pointed out the inadequacy of precautions against firedamp explosions. He questioned the Minister of the Interior, Constans, about the brutal action of the police on 7 June 1891 against an authorized socialist demonstration. The demonstrators were laying a wreath in the square near Sacr√©-C≈ìur, Paris, where Eug√®ne Varlin, a former member of the Commune, had been shot. Victorien Sardou's play Thermidor, first staged at the Comedie-Francaise on 24 January 1891, portrayed the revolution from a conservative viewpoint. It presented Danton and Camille Desmoulins as noble republicans, while Saint-Just and Robespierre were absolute villains. On 26 January Baudin was among a group of radicals led by Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray, mostly socialists, who disrupted the performance. In December 1891 the newly-elected socialist deputy Paul Lafargue spoke against the campaign for separation of church and state. This infuriated most left-wing members. Baudin made the bald statement that socialists were republicans and atheists, and Alexandre Millerand said socialists must oppose the church. When the workers at the Rosi√®res ironworks in Lunery, Cher, went on strike in May 1892 for higher pay and better conditions they immediately telegraphed Baudin and asked him to come and guide the movement. The miners of the Compagnie mini√®re de Carmaux held a stormy meeting on 15 August 1892. The strike began the next day and would drag out for ten weeks. Jean Jaur√®s, Duc-Quercy and Eug√®ne Baudin said the strike was an attempt to guarantee the political liberties of Carmaux voters. Paul Lafargue saw it as part of the wider \\"political and economic battle against the bourgeoisie\\". In the 18 October 1894 session Baudin and Millerand accused Baron Ren√© Reille of deliberately prolonging the strike to punish the strikers. Millerand moved that on the basis of the 1810 and 1838 laws the government should seize the mines. In face of this threat Reille agreed to arbitration. On 1 May 1893, when the government ordered closure of the Labor Exchange (Bourse du Travail), Baudin took part in the protest demonstration. While he was standing with √âdouard Vaillant, who had just addressed the crowd, the police charged the demonstrators. Baudin joined with Jean-Baptiste Dumay, Millerand and Thivrier in appealing to the government. He said he had been brutally beaten by the police at the demonstration, and at the police station one of the policemen said of his parliamentary status, \\"we'll teach you how a deputy is treated.\\" Charles Dupuy, President of the Council and Minister of the Interior, said the police report said Baudin hit the police agents first. Baudin denied this and challenged the government to bring a lawsuit against him. Jean Jaur√®s sided with Baudin, showed the police account was false and asked the government to respect the rights of the socialist opposition. However, the majority voted to give the government authority to prosecute Baudin. Deputy: second term (1893‚Äì98) Expulsion of Christophe Thivrier from the Chamber (February 1894). Baudin is in the center of the rear row. In the 20 August 1893 legislative elections Baudin again ran on the Worker's Party platform, calling for revision of the monarchical constitution of 1875, suppression of the budget for religion, return of church property to the nation, election of magistrates, statutory limits to working hours, a minimum wage, a pension fund for the elderly and an agricultural credit organization. He was elected on the first ballot. He had been sponsored by √âdouard Vaillant's Central Revolutionary Committee (CRC), which became a constituent element of the Socialist Union. The other elected CSC deputies were Vaillant himself and Emmanuel Chauvi√®re. On 1 June 1894 managers at the Graissessac mines responded to a strike vote by firing about 250 workers. Despite provocation, the strike remained peaceful. 133 strikers were arrested but only 9 were convicted for more than making \\"menaces\\". The strikers eventually ran out of money, and Baudin convinced a meeting of strikers on 28 August 1894 to return to work. Baudin held office until 31 May 1898. He was not active in the chamber apart from proposing a bill in 1897 to protect the interests of workers in sugar refineries. At the end of his term Baudin was tired and disillusioned, and did not run again. He remained a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, and contributed to the journal La d√©mocratie de l'Ouest. On 14 July 1899 he signed the Socialist manifesto against the entry of Millerand into the cabinet of Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau. After this he seems to have abandoned politics Last years (1898‚Äì1918) Eug√®ne Baudin's younger brother, Ernest Baudin, was also a ceramist. From 1891 to 1900 Eug√®ne Baudin's address is given as 2bis19 rue de la Quintinie, next door to Ernest Baudin's ceramic workshop. It is possible that the two brothers collaborated between 1889 and 1892, when Ernest was appointed Director of Production at the Manufacture nationale de S√®vres. Eug√®ne may have continued to work at his brother's former studio from 1892 to 1898. Baudin moved to Saint-Briac-sur-Mer, Ille-et-Vilaine, Brittany in 1898 for health reasons. There he opened a ceramic workshop where he made \\"soft sandstones, fired on iridescent porcelain, with metallic reflections.\\" (gr√®s tendres, flamm√©s sur porcelaines iris√©es, reflets m√©talliques). These include a series of faience medallions with blue glaze drawn by the sculptor Th√©ophile Camel (1863‚Äì1911). His work received positive comments from the art critic Roger Marx (1859‚Äì1913). Baudin then settled in Monaco where he continued to make pottery. Eug√®ne Baudin died on 11 April 1918 in Granges-sur-Aube, Marne. He was aged 64.

Adelophthalmidae is the only family classified as part of the superfamily Adelophthalmoidea, which in turn is classified within the infraorder Diploperculata in the suborder Eurypterina. Adelophthalmid eurypterids were small and swimming eurypterids that appeared in the Silurian period. With the earliest known members of the group, Nanahughmilleria prominens and Parahughmilleria maria, being known from deposits of Early Silurian (possibly the Llandovery epoch) age and the very last members, belonging to the long-lasting and widespread genus Adelophthalmus, going extinct in the Early Permian, the Adelophthalmidae is the longest lasting single family of eurypterids. The survival of the group, and of swimming eurypterids (the suborder Eurypterina) beyond the Late Devonian is entirely due to the survival, and subsequent success, of Adelophthalmus throughout the Devonian and Carboniferous. Adelophthalmus (and possibly Unionopterus) represents the only known genus of swimming eurypterids beyond the extinction of the rest of the group in the Late Devonian, extending the temporal range of the group by over a hundred million years. Though the last swimming eurypterids and the final members of the traditionally more successful and numerous suborder Eurypterina, the adelophthalmids were not the last eurypterids. The stylonurines or the \\"walking eurypterids\\" were the last ones, surviving in the family Hibbertopteridae until the Permian-Triassic extinction event or shortly before a few million years after the extinction of the adelophthalmids in the Early Permian. Description Adelophthalmus irinae. The size of the adelophthalmid eurypterids ranged from 4 centimetres (1.6 inch) to 32 cm (12.6 in), the smallest species being Nanahughmilleria clarkei and the largest one being Adelophthalmus khakassicus. The adelophthalmids were relatively small compared to their relatives, such as the gigantic pterygotid Jaekelopterus rhenaniae, which easily exceeded 2 metres (6.5 feet), and was the largest arthropod ever discovered.Lamsdell, James C.; Braddy, Simon J. (2009-10-14). \\"Cope's Rule and Romer's theory: patterns of diversity and gigantism in eurypterids and Palaeozoic vertebrates\\". Biology Letters: rsbl20090700. doi:10.1098/rsbl.2009.0700. ISSN 1744-9561. PMID 19828493. Supplementary information The adelophthalmids were small swimming eurypterids with a parabolic (approximately U-shaped) carapace (the dorsal plate of the head, Unionopterus possibly representing an exception) and with intramarginal (occurring within the margin) eyes. The swimming leg (sixth limb) was of Adelophthalmus-type, that is, with a seventh podomere (segments of the limbs) long and an eighth podomere coarsely serrated. The body had a midsection second order differentiation present (that is, with lateral \\"extensions\\" in the seventh body segment) and with a lanceolate (lance-shaped) telson (\\"tail\\"). The morphology of the group varies depending on how derived (evolutionary advanced) the genus was. In fact, from the basal (\\"primitive\\") Nanahughmilleria to the more derived Adelophthalmus, a gradual decrease in the spinosity (possessing spines) of the appendages (limbs) and an increase in the size of the genital spatulae (a long, flat piece in the genital area) occurred. The even more primitive Pittsfordipterus probably did not even possess the latter. History of research The type specimen of Adelophthalmus granosus, the first adelophthalmid ever described. The first adelophthalmid fossils to be uncovered were those of the type genus, Adelophthalmus. The German paleontologist Hermann Jordan collected the first specimen of the species A. granosus at J√§gersfreude in Saarland, Germany. The specimen would be described three years later by Jordan and Hermann von Meyer, who immediately recognized the eurypterid nature of the fossils by the great resemblance of the overall shape and form of the carapace and appendages with that of Eurypterus. One of the main differences that Jordan and von Meyer noticed was the apparent lack of eyes, which gives name to Adelophthalmus (meaning \\"no obvious eyes\\") and the entire superfamily.Jordan, H. & von Meyer, H. 1854. \\"Ueber die Crustaceen der Steinkohlenformation von Saarbr√ºcken\\". Palaeontographica 4: 1‚Äì15. This feature is now assumed to be due to a preservational artifact and that was not present in Adelophtalmus, nor in any other adelophthalmid. Since then, a total of 33 species have been described, some of which have been historically classified within other genera (Anthraconectes, Glyptoscorpius, Lepidoderma and Polyzosternites, all now synonymous with Adelophthalmus), making Adelophthalmus the most diverse eurypterid genus to date. However, many of these species are fragmentary and could represent synonyms of other species within Adelophthalmus or even species of other genera. It is possible that the large amount of species in Adelophthalmus will eventually provoke its separation into two or three separate genera. In 1948, the Ukrainian paleontologist and geologist Boris Isidorovich Chernyshev described a new genus known by one single specimen from Kazakhstan (at that time part of the Soviet Union) and tentatively classified it as part of the Pterygotidae family. It was named Unionopterus, and its classification is controversial due to the poor illustrations given by Chernyshev and the fact that the only known fossil is presumed to be lost. The genus has been treated as an indeterminate eurypterid, an adelophthalmid or a member of the genus Adelophthalmus, as well as completely ignored. The spinosity of its appendages may suggest the second option, but this is not entirely certain and the phylogenetic classification of Unionopterus may never be resolved. In 1961, the American paleontologist Erik Norman Kjellesvig- Waering considered several species of the genus Hughmilleria sufficiently different from the type species to be separated into a new subgenus, which he named Nanahughmilleria. These species shared a key characteristic, small intramarginal eyes of reniform form (bean-shaped), in contrast to the large ovoid eyes placed in the margin of the carapace present in the genotype and its allied forms. Kjellesvig-Waering designated H. (Nanahughmilleria) norvegica as the type species of the new subgenus. At the same time, he erected a new genus, Parahughmilleria, with P. salteri as the type species. Kjellesvig-Waering based its new clade mainly on the presence of supplementary lobes (distal lobes in a plate-like segment which contains the genital aperture called genital operculum), as well as in the intramarginal eyes. Reconstruction of the swimming leg of Bassipterus. In 1964, Kjellesvig-Waering described the genital operculum of the species H. (N.) phelpsae and suggested that this part of the body could have great phylogenetic importance in the future. Two years later, together with the American paleontologist Kenneth Edward Caster, he raised H. (N.) phelpsae to the generic level under the name Pittsfordipterus. They also described a new genus and species, Bassipterus virginicus. It differs essentially from other adelophthalmids by the specialization of its genital appendage, with characteristics reminiscent of Eurypterus. In 1989, Victor P. Tollerton Jr. described the family Adelophthalmidae along with many others, including Adelophthalmus, Parahughmilleria, Bassipterus and Unionopterus. This clade was based on the presence of spines in the second to fifth pair of appendages, a swimming leg of Adelophthalmus-type and the presence of epimera (lateral \\"extensions\\" of the segment) in the seventh segment. Tollerton commented that some species of Adelophthalmus that did not have spines in the appendages may be better placed in a new genus in the family Slimonidae (he mentioned the now invalid Slimonioidea). Although a new genus for spineless species could be phylogenetically supported, moving it to Slimonidae based on the loss of a feature which seems to have been lost separately in the two groups is not in line with common practice. Odd Erik Tetlie in an unpublished thesis of 2004 erected the superfamily Adelophthalmoidea and the family Nanahughmilleridae. Adelophthalmoidea was diagnosed as eurypterids with parabolic carapaces, small reniform eyes, appendages of variable spinosity and a lanceolate telson, among others. This superfamily would be formally described two years later by Tetlie and Peter Van Roy. On the other hand, Nanahughmilleridae was described to contain the adelophthalmoids with no or reduced genital spatulae and the second to fifth pair of prosomal (of the prosoma, \\"head\\") appendages of Hughmilleria-type. This family contained Nanahughmileria, Pittsfordipterus and perhaps Parahughmilleria. However, the clade has almost never been used in subsequent studies and lists of eurypterids, and instead, they classify the nanahughmillerids as part of Adelophthalmidae. In 2008, Nanahughmilleria patteni was recognized as a different and much more basal species, and therefore a new genus, Eysyslopterus, was named by Tetlie and Markus Poschmann. The carapace of Eysyslopterus and other basal members of the closely related Pterygotioidea (Herefordopterus) and the waeringopteroids (Orcanopterus) has been shown as almost identical, only differing between them by the position of the eyes. Due to the intramarginal position of the eyes, Eysyslopterus has been classified within Adelophthalmidae, but it has also been suggested that it is the sister taxon (closest relative) of a clade formed by Adelophthalmoidea and Pterygotioidea. However, this can not be demonstrated until more fossil material is found. Evolutionary history Type and only known specimen of Nanahughmilleria prominens, one of the earliest adelophthalmids. The eurypterids as a group peaked in diversity during the Silurian, of the approximately 250 valid species accounted for as of , around 139 (‚âà56 %) were from the Silurian alone. Many eurypterid groups are first recorded from the Silurian, such as Pterygotioidea, Mycteropoidea, Stylonuroidea and Adelophthalmoidea itself. The most primitive members of Adelophthalmoidea evolved in Laurussia (an ancient supercontinent, also known as Euramerica). In fact, the most basal species of the clade so far (Eysyslopterus patteni) has been recovered from Ludlovian (around 427-423 mya) deposits of the paleocontinent Baltica (Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, precisely Estonia). However, it is not possible to determine where the clade originated, probably in Baltica or Laurentia (most of eastern continental North America). Although most of the representatives of Adelophthalmoidea have been found in Laurentia, Avalonia (Germany, Great Britain, parts of eastern North America) and Baltica (that is, Laurussia), the nearly cosmopolitan (worldwide) genus Adelophthalmus was also present in the Rheno-Hercynian Terrane (western and central Europe), Siberia and in the Gondwana part of the current Australia. In the Silurian, most of the adelophthalmid genera would appear, but all went extinct soon after or in the Middle Devonian. The oldest representatives of the group were Parahughmilleria maria and Nanahughmilleria prominens, both from the Llandovery (around 444-433 mya), suggesting that the adelophthalmids first appeared around this epoch. This is supported by the appearance of the basal pterygotioids, the sister group of the adelophthalmoids, in the Llandovery. However, the fossil record of Adelophthalmoidea is very poor in the Early Silurian and both species have disputed ages. The unequivocally oldest representative was P. hefteri, with fossils found in the Kip Burn Formation, Lesmahagow, Scotland, from the beginning of the Wenlockian epoch (around 433-427 mya). These fossils differ slightly in the proportions of the body with the fossils of its type locality (in Germany) and have been compared with the latter ones, but the assignment of the Scottish fossils to P. hefteri is not entirely certain. The first species lived in brackish-estuarine water or in fully marine habitats. In the Emsian (around 393-408 mya, in Early Devonian), the earliest species of Adelophthalmus appeared, A. sievertsi, presenting basal features such as the wide swimming leg (as in Nanahughmilleria and Parahughmilleria). The eurypterids were one of the groups most heavily affected by the Late Devonian extinction event, following a major decline in diversity during the Early Devonian, eurypterids were rare in marine environments by the Late Devonian. Of the 16 eurypterid families that had been alive at the beginning of the Devonian, only three persisted into the Carboniferous, all of them non-marine groups. The suborder Eurypterina was rendered almost completely extinct, only surviving Adelophthalmoidea (represented by Adelophthalmus). Size comparison of the largest species of five adelophthalmid genera. Adelophthalmus would rapidly diversify, already being present in Siberia and Gondwana (Australia) since the Devonian. In the Carboniferous, the distribution of Adelophthalmus became approximately circumequatorial (around the Equator). Out of the 33 species referred to Adelophthalmus, 23 (69%) were from the Carboniferous alone, reaching its peak diversity in the Late Carboniferous and becoming the most common of all eurypterids of the Late Paleozoic. This quick diversification may be due to their morphology, converting the adelophthalmids in one of the most able swimmers among the eurypterids. The amalgamation (union) of Pangaea into a global supercontinent was also an important factor. The pterygotoids were also successful swimmers, but they went extinct in the Middle Devonian, long before the formation of Pangea. Although Unionopterus also appeared in the Carboniferous, this genus is very little known and is usually ignored by the eurypterid researchers. During the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian, Adelophthalmus lived in brackish and freshwater environments adjacent to coastal plains, a type of common and stable habitat at the time. Although the formation of Pangea helped the genus to widespread, it also affected its environments. They began to disappear due to a climatic change that caused alterations of depositional and vegetational patterns across the world, provoking a decrease in number of the genus. A. sellardsi from the Artinskian (around 290-284 mya, Early Permian) epoch of Kansas, United States, was the last species of Adelophthalmus and therefore of all the suborder Eurypterina. The genus expanded the temporal range of the suborder by about 100 million years and turned its family to the longest lasting single family of eurypterids. Nevertheless, the eurypterids continued to exist represented by the stylonurids. The Russian hibbertopterid species Campylocephalus permianus persisted until the Changhsingian (around 254-252 mya, Late Permian) stage, being the last known eurypterid. No eurypterids are known from fossil beds higher than the Permian, indicating that they probably died out in the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event or shortly before. Classification External phylogeny Type A genital appendage of Pittsfordipterus phelpsae. The adelophthamids are classified within the infraorder Diploperculata, in the Eurypterina suborder of eurypterids. The infraorder Diploperculata contains the four most derived superfamilies of eurypterine eurypterids; Carcinosomatoidea, Adelophthalmoidea, Pterygotioidea and the waeringopteroids, united by the shared feature that the genital operculum (the structure that contains the genital appendage) is made up of two fused segments. Adelophthalmoidea was one of the most diverse taxonomically eurypterid clades, with about 40 species described. The sister group of Adelophthalmoidea, Pterygotioidea, surpassed this amount with around 50 described species, becoming the most diverse superfamily to date. These sister-clades are the most derived in the Eurypterina and make up more than a third of all the species of eurypterids, with almost 100 species between both of them. The cladogram below is simplified from 2007 study by O. Erik Tetlie, showcasing the position of Adelophthalmoidea within the suborder Eurypterina. Placement of Diploperculata follows Lamsdell et al. 2013. Internal phylogeny Carapace of Eysyslopterus patteni, the basalmost adelophthalmid genus and species. All adelophthalmids have a series of shared characteristics that make them different from the rest of eurypterids. However, some genera developed different features within Adelophthalmidae that divide the family into several smaller clades and groupings. The genera Parahughmilleria and Adelophthalmus form a derived clade based on the presence of enlarged spines on at least one podomere in the appendage V (fifth limb), the presence of epimera in the postabdomen (body segments 8 to 12) and the large spatulae that has been associated with the genital operculum. Nanahughmilleria is placed as the sister taxon of this clade but more basal due to the increased spinosity of its appendage V and in the small size of the genital spatulae. Bassipterus and Pittsfordipterus are positioned as relatively more basal to this clade and form a group supported by two synapomorphies (shared characteristics different from that of their latest common ancestor); long narrow eyes and a complex termination of the genital appendage. At the base of the family, Eysyslopterus has been interpreted as the most basal adelophthalmid. The carapace of this genus, Herefordopterus and Orcanopterus were almost identical and were mainly differentiated by the eye position. In the latter, the eyes were almost marginal, but were separated from margin by the marginal rim. The eyes of Herefordopterus were completely marginal, a characteristic present in all the pterygotioid genera. Although the eyes of Eysyslopterus were intramarginal, they were much closer to the margin than in its relatives, suggesting that the eyes gradually migrated towards the center of the carapace from the basal genera to the derived Adelophthalmus. The position of its eyes has led some researchers to question whether Eysyslopterus is an adelophthalmid at all or a sister taxon of Adelophthalmidae, but more fossils are required to either prove or disprove its phylogenetic position within the family or outside it. The cladogram below presents the inferred phylogenetic positions of most of the genera included in the three most derived superfamilies of the Eurypterina suborder of eurypterids (Adelophthalmoidea, Pterygotioidea and the waeringopteroids), as inferred by O. Erik Tetlie and Markus Poschmann in 2008, based on the results of a 2008 analysis specifically pertaining to the Adelophthalmoidea and a preceding 2004 analysis. Paleoecology Fossil of Adelophthalmus imhofi, exhibited at the Senckenberg Museum, Frankfurt. The adelophthlmids as a whole inhabited environments situated near the coastal realm, with preferences in lagoons, estuaries or deltas, which have reduced salinity. A marine influence is commonly found in horizons (sections of the fossil site) that comprise eurypterids, but marine index fossils (fossils that indicate a marine environment and ecosystem) in many cases are not associated with eurypterids. In some cases, where the adelophthalmids are very rare, the fossils could have been deposited in a different place from the one they originated, exemplified by A. waterstoni, which is known from a single specimen that is in turn the only eurypterid of the zone, the Gogo Formation of Australia, where more than 2,000 crustaceans have been found. The first adelophthalmids, for example the Scottish Parahughmilleria hefteri, have been conserved in non-marine brackish-estuarine habitats, with possible tidal influence, although basal forms that inhabited completely marine deposits are known. This preference remained constant in Adelophthalmidae until Adelophthalmus appeared. In deposits of the Early Devonian of Germany, where Parahughmilleria hefteri and Adelophthalmus sievertsi coexisted, a more obvious marine influence is observed in the sections dominated by Parahughmilleria than in those dominated by Adelophthalmus. This suggests that Adelophthalmus had a preference for habitats dominated by freshwater, unlike other more basal forms. This preference for freshwater habitats is stronger during the Bashkirian and Moscovian times (in the Late Carboniferous), times in which fossils of Adelophthalmus have been associated with freshwater bivalves and terrestrial organisms in coal-bearing strata (indicating a coal swamp environment). However, this could be related to the diversification of Adelophthalmus in those epochs more than an ecological change in the whole genus. Most of the Adelophthalmus species were confined to paralic (in shallow water near the coast) or lowland basins, in depositional environments that had a close connection with marginally marine habitats. For example, during the Moscovian, the Saar-Nahe Basin (where fossils of A. granosus have been found), was connected or even part of a vast western subsiding area (a sunken zone) in whose drainage went towards the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, some 1,500 kilometres (930 miles) towards the south. During the Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian, due to the southern uplift, the drainage began to go north towards the Panthalassa Ocean, increasing the distance to the ocean (about 2,400 km, 1490 mi). Adelophthalmus is not found in these deposits, while others indicative of a connection with a marginal marine habitat, such as the bellinurid xiphosurans, persisted. Some of the last occurrences of the adelophthalmids (end of the Carboniferous and Early Permian) seem to have had a kind of reversion in ecological preferences, inhabiting environments with a strong marine influence again, the especially tidally estuarine environments. Adelophthalmidae is considered as a euryhaline (able to adapt in different salinities) clade that inhabited stressful habitats with regard to paleosalinity and possibly oxygen whose conquest of freshwater habitats was not as successful as in other animals such as the aforementioned bellinurids.

Upon Alexander's death he became the satrap of Aria and Drangiana. He lost control of his satrapies after being defeated by the Antigonids in the Wars of the Diadochi. Biography Map of Alexander's empire and his route. Stasander was born in the Kingdom of Soloi, in the 4th century B.C. At the time of his birth the ten city-kingdoms of Cyprus were vassal states of the Achaemenid Empire (Persians) which had conquered them either in 546 or 526. In May 334, the Achaemenids came into conflict with Kingdom of Macedon ruled by Alexander the Great. The Cypriots and Phoenicians formed the core of the Persian navy in the Mediterranean consisting of 400 ships. Upon receiving news of the devastating Persian defeat at the Battle of Issus, the Cypriot kingdoms defected to the Macedonians assembling at Sidon in the middle of May 332. Alexander pardoned the Cypriots on account that their allegiance to the Persians was a matter of duress. Cypriots took part in Alexander's numerous conquests starting from the Siege of Tyre. Stasander and his brother Stasanor were among those who entered the service of Macedon, eventually becoming Alexander's companions, an inner circle of his most trusted generals. Their rapid promotion may have been due to the fact that they belonged to the royal house of Soloi. Alexander ordered Stasanor to arrest Arsaces the satrap of Aria. Stasanor consequently assumed power in the satrapy himself. In 323, Alexander died and his empire was partitioned among his generals. As a result of the 321 Partition of Triparadisus Stasanor was granted the satrapies of Bactria and Sogdiana, whilst Stasander took over Aria and Drangiana. During the course of the Wars of the Diadochi he sided with Eumenes against Antigonus I Monophthalmus. He was defeated by the Antigonids at the Battle of Gabiene. Antigonus ultimately defeated Eumenes and his allies giving Stasander's satrapies to Euitus. The date of Stasander's death is unknown.

It is one of the superfamilies classified as part of the suborder Eurypterina. Some carcinosomatoid genera have been suggested to have been fully marine as opposed to living in near-shore brackish or hypersaline environments. The majority of carcinosomatoid taxa are known from the paleocontinents of Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia. Isolated and fragmentary fossils from the Late Silurian of Vietnam and the Czech Republic show that the terranes of Annamia and Perunica were within the geographical range of the carcinosomatoids. Only a few basal carcinosomatoids (e.g. Carcinosoma and Paracarcinosoma) have been found in deeper waters whilst the more derived forms, such as Mixopterus and Lanarkopterus have not. Basal carcinosomatoids (Carcinosomatidae) are likely responsible for the fossil remains in Vietnam and the Czech Republic and may have had a distribution similar to the cosmopolitan distribution of the pterygotoids, though were not as common nor as successful.

Members of the suborder are collectively and informally known as \\"eurypterine eurypterids\\" or \\"eurypterines\\". They are known from fossil deposits worldwide, though primarily in North America and Europe. Seventy-five percent of eurypterid species are eurypterines; this represents 99% of specimens. The superfamily Pterygotioidea is the most species-rich clade, with 56 species, followed by the Adelophthalmoidea with 43 species; as sister taxa, they comprise the most derived eurypterines. Pterygotioidea includes the pterygotids, which are the only eurypterids known to have a cosmopolitan distribution. Though more numerous both in specimens and taxa, the eurypterines have the shorter temporal range of the two eurypterid suborders. They first appeared around the same time as the Stylonurina in the Middle Ordovician. The suborder faced a slow extinction during the Middle and Late Devonian, possibly tied to the emergence of jawed vertebrates. Every Eurypterine genus and lineage went extinct before the Carboniferous save for Adelophthalmus which would go extinct in the Early Permian, millions of years before the Permian-Triassic extinction event that ended the stylonurines.  Description  The Stylonurina and Eurypterina are most easily distinguished by the morphology of the posteriormost prosomal appendage. In the Stylonurina, this appendage takes the form of a long and slender walking leg, lacking a modified spine (termed podomere 7a). In the Eurypterina, the leg is most usually modified and broadened into a swimming paddle and always includes a podomere 7a. Swimming eurypterines represent the absolute majority of both known eurypterid species and known specimens, though the morphology of the walking stylonurines is almost as diverse in appearance, and the fossil record of the eurypterines may therefore simply be more complete than that of the stylonurines, possibly due to varying habitat preferences.  Paleobiogeography  Life restoration of Eurypterus. Eurypterus is by far the most well-studied and well-known eurypterid and its fossil specimens probably represent more than 90 % of all known eurypterid specimens. The most basal eurypterines with swimming legs, the genus Onychopterella, are known from the east coast of Gondwana close to the equator (a region that today is South Africa) from the Late Ordovician. It is not known whether or not the swimming forms originated here or not, but it is speculated that they migrated from Laurentia, since most stylonurines and basal swimming forms are predominantly known from Laurentia and Gondwana otherwise completely lacks basal swimming forms. The megalograptoids were likely the first major successful group of eurypterids, evidenced by a Late Ordovician radiation. All known members of the Megalograptoidea are from the Middle to Late Ordovician of Laurentia, though potential records from the Middle Silurian of Baltica are known in the form of the genus Holmipterus suecicus (though its classification as a megalograptoid is questionable). Eurypteroids are known from Laurentia and Baltica, with one known species from Avalonia. Eurypterus and other eurypteroids appear to have been unable to spread beyond Laurussian waters. The genus Eurypterus in particular dominated many Silurian eurypterid faunas of Laurentia. Despite its abundance, it appears to not have originated in Laurentia, the earliest records of the genus are from Baltica and Eurypterus was thus likely an invasive genus in Laurentia, albeit one that managed to adapt well to the new habitats. The majority of carcinosomatoid taxa are also known from Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia. Isolated and fragmentary fossils from the Late Silurian of Vietnam and the Czech Republic show that the terranes of Annamia and Perunica were within the geographical range of the carcinosomatoids. Only a few basal carcinosomatoids (e.g. Carcinosoma and Paracarcinosoma) have been found in deeper waters whilst the more derived forms, such as Mixopterus and Lanarkopterus have not. Basal carcinosomatoids (Carcinosomatidae) are likely responsible for the fossil remains in Vietnam and the Czech Republic and may have had a distribution similar to the cosmopolitan distribution of the pterygotoids, though were not as common nor as successful. Adelophthalmoids were the longest lasting clade of eurypterines, becoming extinct in the Middle Permian, this is in part due to the survival of Adelophthalmus beyond the Middle Devonian. The earliest records of the genus are from the Early Devonian of western Germany, but following the amalgamation of Pangaea during the Carboniferous and Permian, the genus gained an almost cosmopolitan distribution. The basalmost species in the entire clade are from Baltica and most of the evolution within the basal members took place in Laurussia. By the Devonian, representatives were found in both Siberia and Australia long before the formation of Pangaea. Although the Pterygotoidea only existed for a period of about 40 million years during a time when most continents were widely separated, the clade is the eurypterid clade with the most cosmopolitan distribution. Like other eurypterines, they are most common in Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia, but are also found commonly in other paleocontinents. Fossil remains have been recovered from Australia, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Florida, Saudi Arabia, Iberia, South America, vast swaths of Gondwana, Bohemia and Siberia. The earliest pterygotoids are from the latest Llandovery of Scotland, Laurentia and South China and this mobility makes it difficult to pinpoint the geographical origin of the clade, though it is speculated to have been close to or in Laurentia like the Adelophthalmoidea.  Systematics and relationships  Fossil of Mixopterus, a mixopterid. Eurypterina contains eight superfamilies - Onychopterelloidea, Moselopteroidea, Megalograptoidea, Eurypteroidea, Carcinosomatoidea, Waeringopteroidea, Adelophthalmoidea and Pterygotioidea. The relationships between them remain somewhat unclear, the Megalograptoidea is thought to be relatively primitive (between Onychopterella and the Eurypteroidea) because they lack a synapomorphy of all more derived swimming forms; the modified distal margin of the sixth podomere of the swimming leg. This position is not necessarily true, since the sixth podomere in the swimming leg resembles the reduced podomere found in the Mixopteridae, and they might instead belong between the Eurypteroidea and Carcinosomatoidea. In contrast to the Megalograptoidea, the Eurypteroidea is a rather well-known clade that contains around 90% of all known eurypterid specimens. They were closely related, supported by numerous similarities, to the Carcinosomatoidea. The Carcinosomatoidea have a poorly resolved internal phylogeny, though can be easily recognised by scorpion-like appearance and heavily spinose appendages. Pterygotioidea and Adelophthalmoidea are the two most derived clades as well as the most taxonomically diverse ones. Adelophthalmoidea contains 43 species, whereas Pterygotioidea contains 56. The superfamilies classified as part of Eurypterina contain the following families:Fossil of Jaekelopterus, a pterygotioid.

The 281st overall episode of the series, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 11, 2017. This episode parodies the spread of fake news through sites such as Facebook while also serving as a lead-in to the launch of the video game South Park: The Fractured but Whole. Plot Eric Cartman and his classmates are planning to launch a superhero franchise with an original Netflix series for their \\"Coon and Friends\\" alter egos, but are slandered by fake news stories on Facebook accusing them of burning the American flag and engaging in various sex acts, which damages their reputations. The boys learn Butters Stotch is behind this, but he refuses to stop, as he engages in this activity in the guise of his supervillain identity, Professor Chaos, and has started a company to spread fake news for profit. A Netflix staffperson tells Cartman they cannot approve their series until the problem of the damaging information about them is removed from Facebook. Troubled by the fake stories, the boys' parents decide to invite Facebook chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to a town assembly so he can provide insight on the matter. During his speech, he does not address the citizens' concerns, instead dismissing their complaints and pretending to deflect their attempts to \\"block\\" him by speaking and moving in the style of blocking techniques from martial arts films. After the unsuccessful assembly, he continues to irritate the townspeople by appearing uninvited in their homes and vehicles, showing up at restaurants to eat people's food, and acting as if everyone else's property is his. The townspeople complain to the police about his behavior, who inform the public that they cannot interfere with Zuckerberg's actions because they invited him to town, and let him into their lives. When Coon and Friends confront Butters at his headquarters, Zuckerberg appears, having been paid by Butters to protect him, preventing Coon and Friends from removing the slanderous information from Facebook. Cartman then devises a plan: He and the other boys attack him in front of the other townspeople, who cheer them on. Zuckerberg fights back, beating the children, but Cartman publicly laments that his allies were merely protesting on behalf of persecuted groups like black people and the handicapped, and informs Zuckerberg that the video of him beating the children is being broadcast on Facebook Live. Zuckerberg panics and shuts down the site to prevent the video from spreading further, ending Butters' scheme. Butters' father, Stephen, drags Butters to Russian President Vladimir Putin's office in Moscow, where he angrily rebukes Butters for what he has done, and then does the same to Putin for giving him the idea in the first place. The boys are now able to proceed with their franchise plan, but then split up over disagreements related to the franchise's release schedule. Reception Jesse Schedeen from IGN rated the episode an 8 out of 10, saying \\"While not the strongest episode of the season so far, 'Franchise Prequel' serves as an enjoyable lead-in to The Fractured But Whole while also lampooning recent Facebook controversies. This episode could have done a little more with its Mark Zuckerberg parody. However, the return of Professor Chaos, the scathing critique of fake news and the adults who read it and the terrific ending more than made up for any problems.\\" Jeremy Lambert with 411 Mania rated it a 5 out of 10, stating \\"It's tough to judge 'Franchise Prequel' given that it's 100 percent linked to the release of next week's South Park video game The Fractured But Whole. Some of the stuff that seemed out of nowhere and meaningless in tonight's episode may make sense once we go through the entire story of the videogame.\\" He also added the episode \\"may be a prequel to the game or it may be a 30-minute (with commercials) advertisement for the game. Either way, it didn't feel like your regular episode of South Park.\\" The A.V. Club contributor Dan Caffrey gave the episode a C+ rating, commenting that \\"By the end, 'Franchise Prequel' takes some timely jabs at Marvel's byzantine rollout plan for its cinematic universe, as well as our own complicity in the fake news problem by relying so much on Facebook to begin with. But neither of those elements get more than a scene. Most of the episode just focuses on the kids pretending to be superheroes, which I suppose that makes for an alright video game commercial.\\" References External links *South Park Studios Episode 2104 \\"Franchise Prequel\\" Press Release * Television episodes about Internet culture Television episodes about social media South Park (season 21) episodes Works about Facebook Cultural depictions of Vladimir Putin Cultural depictions of Mark Zuckerberg ","title":"Franchise Prequel"},{"id":"55486870","text":"Cn2 toxin is a single chain Œ≤-scorpion neurotoxic peptide and the primary toxin in the venom of the Centruroides noxious Hoffmann scorpion. The toxin specifically targets mammalian Nav1.6 voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC).  Etymology and source  Cn2 is a neurotoxin named after and derived from the Centruroides noxious scorpion, which originates from and is endemic in the state of Nayarit, Western Mexico. This scorpion produces a venom in which the Cn2 toxin is the most abundant component; it comprises approximately 6.8% of the scorpion venom. Cn2 toxin is one of the most noxious peptides against mammals. Cn2 was initially purified and sequenced under the name of toxin II.9.2.2.  Chemistry  Scorpion toxins affecting the gating mechanisms of sodium channels are classically divided in two major classes: Œ±- and Œ≤-scorpion toxins. However, many functional variations of these peptides have been demonstrated, with almost 10 different toxin subgroups that can be separately listed. Cn2 is generally categorized as a Œ≤-scorpion toxin composed of a single chain polypeptide consisting of 66 amino acids, with an N-terminal amino acid sequence as follows: KEGYIVDKNTGCKYECLKLGDNDYCLRECKQQYGKGAGGYCYAFACWCTHLYEQAIVWPLPNKRCS. The Cn2 toxin comprises a triple-stranded antiparallel Œ≤-sheet, a short Œ±-helix, and four disulfide bridges. Two of these disulfide bridges contribute to maintaining the relative position of one of the Œ≤-sheet and Œ±-helix. The third disulfide bridge binds the long loop between the first Œ≤-sheet and Œ±-helix to the C-terminus, while the fourth binds this loop to the third Œ≤-sheet. The Cn2 peptide contains many aromatic residues: seven tyrosine residues, two tryptophan residues and one phenylalanine residue. These residues form two hydrophobic patches, a hydrophobic core, two positive patches, and a negative patch in the protein, which have been extensively described.  Target  Cn2 specifically targets the mammalian voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) Nav1.6.  Mode of action  It is likely that Cn2 binds most strongly to the extracellular loop between the S3 and S4 segments when the channel is in depolarized state. CssIV, a Œ≤-toxin that shares 57 out of 66 amino acid residues with the Cn2 toxin according to NMR analysis, mainly binds to the extracellular loop between the S3 and S4 segments within the second domain of the target voltage-gated sodium channel. The activation curve of the channel shifts to more hyperpolarized potentials upon binding of the neurotoxin. Thus, only when a depolarizing pulse is applied before Cn2 administration, the current threshold of the target channels shifts from -30 mV to -60 mV in control versus 140 nM Cn2, respectively. An explanation for this phenomenon is that the Cn2 toxin ‚Äòtraps‚Äô the voltage sensor in activated position when it binds the extracellular loop in activated position, as has been hypothesized for Œ≤-toxins in general. The Cn2 toxin also produces a resurgent current and a reduction in peak inward current in the Nav1.6 channel. All these changes seem to increase the excitability of the neurons. However, in Purkinje cells Cn2 can induce an inactivation block in a stimulation paradigm that in control conditions induced regular firing.  Toxicity and treatment   Toxicity  Cn2 toxin is highly toxic to mammals with a reported LD50 of 0.25-0.32 Œºg/20g mouse.  Treatment  Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) have been used to recognize and neutralize Cn2 from Centruroides noxius venom. Specifically, scFv RU1 and LR have shown to complement each other, showing a better neutralization capacity when administered simultaneously. These two scFvs have affinities in the picomolar range and remove most scorpion toxin poisoning symptoms.

Background Burrage was born in Neshoba County, Mississippi, on March 16, 1930. He served in the United States Marine Corps during the 1950s. He was honorably discharged and later started Burrage Trucking, Inc. Burrage sold his trucking company in 1990 and dabbled in cattle farming and timberland resources. He was a Shriner, Mason, and a deacon at a Baptist church. Burrage lived most of his life in Mississippi except when he lived in Houston, Texas, working as a bus driver. Burrage owned a large amount of land in Neshoba County. Freedom Summer Murders In the afternoon of June 21, 1964, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, & Michael Schwerner arrived at Longdale to inspect the burned out church in Neshoba County. They left Longdale around 3 p.m. They were to be in Meridian by 4 p.m. that day. The fastest route to Meridian was through Philadelphia. At the fork of Beacon & Main Street, their station wagon sustained a flat tire. It is possible that a shot was fired at the station wagon's tire. Rainey's home was near the Beacon & Main Street fork. Deputy Cecil Price soon arrived and escorted them to the county jail. Price released the trio as soon as the longest day of the year became night which was about 10 p.m. The three were last seen heading south along Highway 19 toward Meridian. Burrage's Dam Burrage was developing a cattle farm, named the Old Jolly Farm, on Highway 21 which was a few miles southwest of Philadelphia. Burrage hired Herman Tucker to build a dam. Tucker was a part-time driver for Burrage, and Tucker owned two Caterpillar bulldozers. Sometime before the murders, Burrage remarked about the \\"invasion\\" of Civil Rights workers coming to Mississippi. Burrage allegedly proclaimed that, \\"Hell, I've got a dam that'll hold a hundred of them.\\" Arrest In December 1964, Burrage was placed under arrest by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for violation of Title 18, Section 241, United States Code. He was officially arrested at 8:27 a.m., December 4, 1964, and transported via Highway 16 out of Philadelphia, Mississippi east to DeKalb, Mississippi and south from DeKalb on Highway 39 to the Naval Auxiliary Air Station, Meridian, Mississippi where he was taken to the Bachelor Officers Quarters on the base.

After his time with Ferera, his career was remarkably varied, playing with symphony orchestras and country and western bands, often simultaneously, and also working in additional genres before retiring in his mid 90s. Biography Early life and career Antonio Giuseppe Franchini was born to Ercole, a fishmonger, and Genney Franchini in Naples, Italy, on August 2, 1898. As per Italian custom at the time, he began his formal education at age two. His family moved to Boston, United States, in 1903. In Boston he attended Elliott Grade School, and began formal violin lessons under private tutelage the following year. He taught himself mandolin and guitar as he worked out currently popular songs in recreational pursuit. He began his musical career at the age of eight in Boston. He did not finish grade school, dropping out in the eighth grade. In 1914, Franchini joined Tony Colucci and Gus Sullo in a trio of stringed instruments. The highlight of their act was to interchange instruments, in the midst of performing, while playing \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\". They toured the Keith Circuit as \\"French, Fields and Foley\\". The act ended in 1917, as Colucci chose to relocate to New York. Franchini joined the United States Army in June 1917, even though he was not yet a citizen of the United States. He was placed in Battery F, 5th Division of the 19th Field Artillery Regiment, where he operated a 70mm gun. He spent ten months in training at a base near Leon Springs, Texas. Sent overseas, he landed in Brest, France, and conditioned there before being sent to the Vosges for combat. He spent eight months in combat, participating in the battles of Saint-Mihiel and Ch√¢teau-Thierry. As part of the occupation he was assigned to Koblenz and remained there until he was discharged on October 18, 1919. With Frank Ferera Franchini lived in a hotel in New York City upon arriving back to the States. There, he met up again with Colucci and Sullo and the three held a jam session in Franchini's room. Frank Ferera, who resided in a room above Franchini's, overheard the music and was impressed to the point that he requested that Franchini make a record with him. Thus Franchini began recording with Ferera in 1919, a few months before Helen Louise Greenus (Ferera's wife and recording partner) disappeared at sea. Ferera asked Franchini to be his recording partner in 1920. Together they became one of the most popular recordings artists in the 1920s. Labels that released Ferrera and Franchini duets include Brunswick, Columbia, Emerson, Gennett, Lyric, Okeh, Path√©, Paramount, and Victor. During their association, the duo of \\"Ferera and Franchini\\" typically recorded four to six sessions every single day. Besides records released under their names they also recorded behind Anna Case, Vernon Dalhart, Ernest Hare, Billy Jones, and Bert Williams. Altogether, more than 3500 sides were recorded by Ferera and Franchini. On top of this, he was also an active session musician in his own right, accompanying Dalhart on some of Dalhart's early country music recordings and diversely performing Spanish music in Victor's ethnic catalog. This period of activity was financially a time of great prosperity for Franchini. Franchini did more than make phonograph records. Ferera and Franchini worked tirelessly to learn material, it took extra time as Ferera could not read music. Fortunately Franchini was a good cook, and liked to make Itialian dishes when practicing at Ferera's living quarters. Franchini took a break from recording activities in 1924 to conduct the Nat Martin Orchestra which was supporting the Marx Brothers in the revue I'll Say She Is. In 1926 he formed a school of music in which was to last through the late 1940s, serving as its director. Ferera abruptly decided to leave the music business in 1927, and a seven-and-a-half year partnership ended amicably. Franchni signed as a composer to the Irving Berlin publishing company. From 1928 to 1932 he was musical arranger for the RKO Pictures program on WEAF. At the same time, he was musical director for Paramount's Koko the Clown. However, the period was financially disastrous for Franchini. Previously wealthy, he lost his fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and as record and publishing sales subsequently dried up in the following Great Depression, so did his formerly lucrative royalty income. Post-Ferera: a varied career Franchini spent the period of 1932 to 1936 concentrating on his compositions, working with Claude Hopkins and Clarence Williams, among others. Franchini wrote more than 150 compositions under the name Mel Ball. Most of them were in the Hawaiian music genre. He then spent the next two school years teaching music at Hobbs Junior High School in Medford, Massachusetts. In 1938 he returned to songwriting, including an extended idea-gathering tour through the Midwest that lasted from 1939 to 1940. He transcribed Hawaiian music into English, and wrote original songs such as \\"Just an Old Bouquet of a Bygone Day\\", \\"Pretending\\" and \\"Talking to My Heart\\", the last a collaboration with Jimmy Dorsey. Upon the attack on Pearl Harbor, Franchini drove from his home in Medford to Camp Edwards in order to volunteer again for the armed services. He was given the rank of Corporal and assigned to the 101st Engineers Band. His service was mostly non-musical. He was sent to Jefferson Barracks Military Post where he became a drill sergeant, teaching obstacle course and arms nomenclature. During his World War Two service, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1942. He was never sent overseas before his discharge on May 15, 1943. His next stop was in Houston, where he joined a trio that was the resident entertainment at Houston's Cotton Club. Soon afterwards, he joined the Houston Symphony as a violinist under Ernst Hoffmann. He attended the University of Houston at this time, taking studies in Italian and Social Studies. Franchini moved to New Orleans in 1946, under contract with Ted Phillips Orchestra at the Jung Hotel. Later in the year he was booked at the Mirror Room in the Alexandria, Louisiana Bentley Hotel. Here he was partnered with organist/showgirl Princess White Cloud for what was originally to be two weeks, but the popularity of the show extended the contract to four months, upon which Princess White Cloud had to leave because of a previous agreement with a circus. Franchini found himself in Shreveport, Louisiana, when he met Hank Williams. Williams knew Franchini by reputation as a Hawaiian guitarist and a classical violinist, but asked Franchini if he could do a \\"hoe down\\". Franchini proceeded to play one, and a surprised Williams was so impressed he immediately requested that Franchini join his touring group, an offer which was accepted. Franchini, under the pseudonym Tony Zachary, played fiddle for Hank Williams from 1949 to 1951. Williams, with Franchini in tow, toured as a unit with Hank Snow and the Bailes Brothers. In between tours, he spent time in Los Angeles, playing at clubs. In his spare time he learned German and improved his Spanish at the Berlitz School of Languages. He joined the Henry Busse orchestra in 1951 as lead violinist, touring California, Nevada, and Nebraska. Franchini left Busse in May 1953 in order to form another combo under his own control. In-between tours with Busse he played with the Phoenix Symphony and the El Paso Symphony orchestras. He spent 1953 playing nightclubs. Then he spent the following two years with the Tucson Symphony Orchestra, while simultaneously playing Western music in nightclubs. At the end of 1955, Franchini moved to Las Vegas, where he played for the Dunes Hotel as it opened, played at the Sahara for four weeks accompanying Marlene Dietrich, and finished the year with the Jimmie Durante show at the Desert Inn. It was back to California in 1956, where he teamed with Ace and Duece Spriggins, formerly of the Sons of the Pioneers, and together they played for private occasions around Palm Springs and at the Mirador Hotel there. Franchini left the Spriggins, as he desired to relocate back to New York City. Franchini went back to school, and in 1957 earned a college degree in biochemistry. He further expanded his musical repertoire when he played rock and roll as part of the Sampson Horton Orchestra on Jay Gee Records. The next three years (1958‚Äì1961) were of a more sedate musical persuasion, as they were spent touring with the Mantovani orchestra. This was in turn followed by more road time with the national touring production of The Sound of Music. Later life and career Franchini converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1966. He moved to Las Vegas in the 1970s, where became an activist for the Republican Party, campaigning for Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush and volunteering at election day polls into his 90s. He worked in many casino orchestras, and in his 80s also supplemented his income as a strolling violinist for local Las Vegas restaurants. In 1983 he re-arranged The Star- Spangled Banner, as he felt the song too difficult to sing for most people. The Nevada members of the United States Congress presented this arrangement to three presidents in hopes it would be considered. His last musical engagement was as a mandolinist as part of a trio while in his 90s. Franchini died at the age of 99 on September 17, 1997, at a Las Vegas hospital. He is buried at Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Boulder City, Nevada. His scrapbooks and other memorabilia were donated to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Personal life Franchini was married three times, each of which ended in divorce. Franchini enjoyed robust health into his late 90s; he regularly drove until he broke a hip at age 97.

Stage actor  Andrews began her career in as an actor in stage plays in New York City. These included a musical comedy, Great Day, at the Cosmopolitan Theatre in 1929,, Ol' Man Satan in 1932, and the operetta Africana in 1934. She also appeared in a 1932 film, The Black King.  Cultural context  In the early 1930s, Andrews studied dance under Asadata Dafora. People in the United States in this era largely regarded Africans as savage and animalistic, and Dafora was part of bringing an awareness of their humanity and an appreciation for their culture. citing and The new interest in African music and dance offered a new positive black identity rooted in ancient, pre-colonial traditions. This movement in art and culture was connected to the Harlem Renaissance and the N√©gritude movement.  Teacher of African dance  After studying with Dafora, Andrews began teaching African dance at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem in 1934. This makes her one of the earliest major teachers of African dance in the United States, along with Efiom Odok and Dafora. She also taught at Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, which was one of the primary centers of African American culture in New York City at the time. Her students included Chief Bey, Pearl Primus, Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson,, Alice Dinizulu, and Alexandreena Dixon. Ismay Andrews never traveled to Africa, but learned African traditions through researching in public libraries.  1940s  In the 1940s, Andrews focused on the dances of East Africa. She founded and directed a dance company known as the Swa-Hili Dancers who performed re- constructed East African dances. They performed on stage at the Stage Door Canteen, in cabarets, and for the USO during World War II. The African American community in Harlem strongly supported Andrews cultural work throughout her career. She died in poverty in New York City.

She created the advocacy group Ex-Muslims of North America (EXMNA), which seeks to normalize religious dissent and to help former Muslims leave the religion by linking them to support networks. She is the co-founder and director of development for EXMNA. Early life Haider was born in Karachi, Pakistan, in a practicing Shia Muslim family. Her family moved to the United States when she was seven years old and she was raised in Houston, Texas. She was a devout Muslim as a child. In a 2017 interview with the blog Gene Expression, she said of her religious participation: She became an atheist at the age of 16. She believes that she was lucky enough to have a relatively liberal father who may not have let her wear shorts or have boyfriends but still allowed her to read any books she wanted, including those critical of Islam, and allowed her to move away from home to go to college. Her journey into questioning religion began when her atheist friends in high school started having debates with her. One of her friends would print off \\"horrible\\" verses from the Quran and would hand them to her without any further commentary. She set out to prove her atheist friends wrong and started studying the Quran to understand the context of these verses. However, she stated that sometimes the context was worse and she slowly became an atheist. Her father has since become an atheist as well. Haider described the journey to atheism with her father to the Reason Rally in 2016 as a long series of debates spanning over a decade. However, it was not until her father discovered Facebook groups of other Pakistani atheists that had active members who were his age that he felt comfortable leaving Islam. She now advises ex- Muslims to find their family secular peers to make them more comfortable leaving religion. After finishing college, she moved to Washington, DC, and became involved with non-profit and social advocacy groups. This involvement inspired her to launch her own non-profit advocacy group later on. She still currently lives in Washington.  Activism  Haider explains the goals and actions of EXMNA (2017) Muhammad Syed, Sarah Haider and Heina Dadabhoy speaking at the American Atheist Convention 2015. In 2013 Haider and Muhammad Syed co-founded Ex-Muslims of North America (EXMNA), an advocacy organization and online community which aims to normalize religious dissent and to helping create local support communities for those who have left Islam. The organization was first based in just Washington, DC, and Toronto, but is now active in over 25 locations in the United States and Canada. EXMNA believes Muslim communities often shun those who are accused of apostasy as well as their families and that fear of excommunication and violence makes it dangerous for closeted ex-Muslims if they are exposed as disbelievers. They have stated that Islamic \\"apostates live with a level of threat that influences every aspect of life,\\" because when someone leaves the faith they often lose their community and social support including their mosque, their friends, and even potentially their family. This is the reason why EXMNA believes that it is very important to normalize dissent in religious communities and why they have created a network of social support for those who chose to leave Islam. Due to the fear of apostates being \\"outed,\\" EXMNA has a lengthy screening process to ensure the security and safety of EXMNA members. In 2015 she gave a speech called \\"Islam and the Necessity of Liberal Critique\\" at the American Humanist Association's 74th annual conference in Denver, Colorado, that has been widely viewed since uploaded to YouTube. During an interview with Dave Rubin she explained her excitement by saying \\"it felt like my whole life was leading up to that speech.\\" However she said she was nervous to deliver the speech, believing the topic of Islam and dissent to be \\"sensitive\\", yet was delighted at how well the speech was received. Haider, a self-described liberal, is disheartened by what she feels is a hostile attitude towards Ex-Muslims by her fellow liberals. She has said women who leave Islam often \\"face ostracism, beatings, harassment and threats from their families and communities, forced travel back to home countries to pry them free of Western influence, and forced marriage,\\" and therefore should be among the most welcomed by the liberal community. However, she feels that she and other Ex-Muslims are shunned by the left, having been called an Islamophobe. Haider has stated that this makes the position of Ex-Muslim atheists precarious because \\"the political right is not our friend. We don't have allies on the right due to our atheism,\\" but at the same time she feels Ex- Muslims also have very few allies on the left. In 2017 Haider decided to take EXMNA on a tour around the United States and Canada to speak at college campuses throughout the 2017‚Äì2018 academic year. EXMNA spoke on a variety of topics that affect Muslims and ex-Muslims. See also * Ali A.

Based on his work, it is believed that he lived most of his life in Italy but had travelled to northern Africa. His work was translated and incorporated into many European language works and it included instructions for cataract treatment. The earliest known English work that incorporates his teachings is Philip Barrough's The Method of Phisicke (1583). The oldest printed version of his book is edited by Severino of Ferrara from 1474. A copy of this was translated into English by Casey Albert Wood in 1929. The work of Benvenutus Grassus also made use of the works of Ali Ibn Isa's Tadhkirat al-Kahhalin (\\" The Oculists' Memorandum Book \\") which was probably published in the 11th century. A study of a German translation has suggested that Grassus studied at the Salernitan school of medicine which had connections to Arab medicine. The text claims that Grassus learnt from a variety of sources and practiced by travelling to various places both in the temperate and tropic areas.

Stochastic Signal Density Modulation (SSDM)US Patent 8129924 Stochastic signal density modulation for optical transducer control (Mar 6, 2012)US Patent 8476846 Stochastic signal density modulation for optical transducer control (Jul 2, 2013) is a novel power modulation technique primarily used for LED power control. The information is encoded - or the power level is set - using pulses that have pseudo random widths. The pulses are produced in such a way that on average the produced signal will have a desired ratio between high and low states. The main benefit of using SSDM over for example Pulse-width modulation (PWM), which is usually the preferred method for controlling LED power, is reduced electromagnetic interference. Figure 1 illustrates a SSDM signal and demonstrates how the average signal density approaches desired value. The pseudo random pulses in the signal are clearly visible. SSDM can be seen as a special case of Pulse-density modulation (PDM) or Random Pulse Width Modulation (RPWM). Principle and signal creation Figure 2: SSDM generation block diagram. Figure 3: creation of 5-bit SSDM signal with 30% signal density. Producing SSDM signal requires a Linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) or similar source providing a sequence of pseudo random numbers, a signal density register and a comparator. On each clock cycle, the LFSR provides one pseudo random number. This is compared against the signal density register. Should the signal density register be at or lower than the generated pseudo random number, output is set to high. If the signal density register is higher than the generated pseudo random number, the output is set to low. This is illustrated in figure 2.AN47372: PrISM Technology for LED Dimming Cypress Semiconductor (Apr 28, 2017)Stochastic Signal Density Modulation Datasheet Cypress Semiconductor (Jul 24, 2014) When LFSR is used to provide pseudo random numbers with maximum possible period, the sequence will contain each of the numbers in the range once (except the zero), and eventually repeat.16-Bit Hardware PrISM Datasheet Cypress Semiconductor (Mar 3, 2014) For a 4-bit LFSR the sequence is [1 2 5 3 7 6 4]. If the signal density register would be set to 3, would the corresponding SSDM signal be repeating the [1 1 0 1 0 0 0] pattern. Figure 3 demonstrates the signal generation process. Generated sequence of pseudo random numbers is shown in the first sub-plot along with a desired 30% threshold. The lower plot is the produced SSDM signal. It can be seen that the output is high only when the generated pseudo random numbers are at or below the desired threshold. The SSDM signal will average at 30% of the maximum. Also the repetitive nature of LFSR is clearly visible in the pseudo random number sequence and in the resulting SSDM signal. Comparison against other modulation methods Figure 4: SSDM and PWM signals compared Figure 5: Amplitude spectrum of simulated SSDM and PWM signals SSDM has significant advantages over PWM when used for power control. In PWM signal, the frequency at which the output is turned high is constant. Only the width of the pulses is varied. This results in relatively high electromagnetic interference amplitude. In the case of SSDM, as the pulse widths and intervals are not constant, the resulting interference is spread across wider spectrum reducing the overall interference amplitude. The fundamentally different operational principles of SSDM and PWM are illustrated on figure 4. Both signals are shown with two different signal density or pulse-width ratios: 10% and 70%. Figure 5 illustrates the simulated spectrum of SSDM signal compared to PWM. Both are set to 30% signal density or pulse width, and operate on the same frequency. As it can be seen, the amplitude on the lowest frequency component in SSDM is attenuated more than 20 dB. This also demonstrates that for SSDM most of the signal energy is shifted to higher frequencies.. Some sources cite attenuation of 30 dB However, due to the higher frequencies present in the signal the SSDM may demand more from the load-driving circuitry than PWM. If there is any filtering present in the SSDM signal to reduce the higher frequency components may this have also an effect on the signal density. It's also worth noting that the increased number of individual transitions may also increase the switching losses on the MOSFETs used. Like PWM, Delta-sigma_modulation (DSM) produces far higher amplitude on the fundamental frequency and for the four following harmonics than SSDM.Cypress Semiconductor AN49262: Modulation Techniques for LED Dimming Cypress Semiconductor (Oct 22, 2008) Practical implementation Hardware support The SSDM technology is patented by Cypress Semiconductor. Hence the microcontrollers supporting SSDM signal generation using dedicated hardware modules are PSoC devices from Cypress Semiconductor. SSDM module is available in PSoC 1 series devices. With PSoC series 3, 4 and 5 Precision Illumination Signal Modulation (PrISM)Precision Illumination Signal Modulation (PrISM) Datasheet Cypress Semiconductor (Feb 20, 2013) modules can be used. PrISM is interchangeable for SSDM. While it is recognized in US Patent 8129924 that one practical option in signal generation is using CPLD or FPGA devices, as off October 2017 no such implementations are publicly disclosed. Considerations When creating SSDM signal regardless of the method (HW, FPGA, Software) some consideration should be put on the frequency at which the signal is created and the other circuitry: * The lowest frequency the signal created will have is determined by the frequency at which the LFSR creates random numbers and the desired resolution as follows: F_text{out} = frac{F_text{LFSR}}{2^n-1}. * When SSDM is used for LED power control, the driving frequency should be higher than the Flicker_fusion_threshold. For PrISM technology, 120 Hz minimum frequency on the output should be sufficient to avoid visible flicker. 300 Hz to guarantee flicker-free operation. * When the frequency of the SSDM signal increases, so does also the number of high frequency components. This may affect the output- driving circuitry, and in some cases filtering may occur. Filtering may affect the resulting pulse density. * Some implementations do demonstrate the use of a low-pass filter that is set to filter the higher part of the frequencies in the SSDM signal.US Patent 8044612 Method and apparatus for networked illumination devices (Jun 7, 2007) * The use of SSDM may increase switching losses. * The impact of the higher frequency components in the SSDM signal on other systems should be analyzed.

Volunteer Origins The unit's predecessor, the 3rd Volunteer Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment, had been formed in June 1900 by detaching six companies from the regiment's 1st Volunteer Battalion. These companies were based in the north and east of Lincolnshire, and battalion headquarters was established at Grimsby. Prior to their consolidation into the 1st Volunteer Battalion in 1880, these companies had been separate Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) raised during the first enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement (dates of formation are those of the first officers' commissions):Westlake pp. 156‚Äì9.Beckett, Appendix VII.Frederick, pp. 226‚Äì7 Sandall, Introduction.MacDonald, pp. 14‚Äì17.Lincolnshire at Great War Drill Halls * A & B Companies, formerly 6th (Grimsby Rifles) Lincolnshire RVC (20 March 1860), based at the Infantry Drill Hall, Doughty Road, GrimsbyGrimsby at Drill Hall Project * C Company, formerly 7th (Spilsby) Lincolnshire RVC (17 March 1860), based at the Drill Hall, Hatton Road, SpilsbySpilsby at Drill Hall Project * D Company, formerly 2nd (Louth Rifles) Lincolnshire RVC (21 November 1859), based at the Drill Hall, Northgate, LouthLouth at Drill Hall Project * E Company, formerly 12th (Barton) Lincolnshire RVC (12 January 1860), based at the Drill Hall, Butts Road, Barton-upon-HumberBarton at Drill Hall Project * F Company, formerly 11th (Alford) Lincolnshire RVC (23 February 1860), based at the Drill Hall, Corn Exchange, AlfordAlford at Drill Hall Project * G & H Companies, formerly 20th (Market Rasen) Lincolnshire RVC (16 July 1860, previously based at Frodingham); in 1900 based at the Drill Hall, Home Street ScunthorpeScunthorpe at Drill Hall Project with a half company at Brigg.Brigg at Drill Hall Project The Grimsby recruits were chiefly drawn from men employed in the fishing industry and docks; the Frodingham and Scunthorpe men came from the iron ore and smelting industries; Louth, Spilsby, Alford and Brigg were agricultural areas, while most of the Gainsborough men were drawn from the Marshall, Sons & Co. agricultural engineering works and the Barton men from the Elswick Hopper cycle works. The volunteer battalions of the Lincolnshire Regiment formed part of the North Midland Brigade of the Volunteer Force, but with so many of its companies situated along the south shore of the Humber Estuary, the 3rd Volunteer Bn was attached to the Humber Brigade for training.Quarterly Army List, October 1907 Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms in 1908, the 3rd Volunteer Bn was converted into the 5th Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment, joined by E and F Companies (formerly 19th (Gainsborough) Lincolnshire RVC, raised 10 July 1860) from the 1st Volunteer Bn, which became the new H Company, based at the Drill Hall in Spital Terrace in Gainsborough. (The remainder of the 1st and the 2nd Volunteer Bns together formed the 4th Bn Lincolns). The first commanding officer (CO) of the 5th Bn was Lt-Col George Beaumont Walker.Monthly Army List, various dates. The two TF battalions of the Lincolns, together with those of the Leicestershire Regiment formed the Lincolnshire & Leicestershire Brigade of the North Midland Division.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 61‚Äì7.James, p. 54.Lincolns at Long, Long Trail. First World War Mobilisation On 25 July 1914 the two Lincolnshire TF battalions assembled at Bridlington for their annual camp, being joined on 2 August by the Leicestershire battalions to make a full brigade camp. However, with the international situation deteriorating, the units returned to their homes on 3 August and on the evening of 4 August the orders for mobilisation were issued. By the afternoon of 6 August the whole battalion was concentrated at the Infantry Drill Hall, Grimsby, and billeted in schools in the town.Sandall, Ch. 1.Simpson, pp. 48‚Äì50. The battalion's first duties were to guard Grimsby docks and harbour, the electric power station and wireless station, and to dig trenches by the mouth of the Humber at Cleethorpes. However, by 11 August the 5th Lincolns was able to hand these over to the Special Reserve battalions of the Manchester Regiment and proceed to the brigade's war station at Belper. It then entrained in 15 August for Luton, where the North Midland Division went into training. The 5th Lincolns was considerably below its establishment strength in the summer of 1914, recruitment among agricultural workers being especially difficult. At Belper the men were invited to volunteer for active service overseas. At first the response was half-hearted, but by the end of August at Luton the numbers reached 650 and the battalion was accepted for foreign service, as was the whole division. The men who had not volunteered became the nucleus of a reserve battalion nearby at Dunstable. Later the Foreign Service and Reserve battalions were numbered 1/5th and 2/5th respectively. Both were brought up to full strength by recruits, and the 2/5th joined a new 2nd North Midland Division in January 1915. A new Reserve or 3/5th Bn was raised in April 1915 to train drafts for the 1st and 2nd Lines.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 17‚Äì23. On 1 September 1914, 52 former pupils of Wintringham School, Grimsby, formed a company based at the armoury of the school's Officer Training Corps. The company was offered to the 5th Lincolns, but by then the battalion was full. The volunteer company then became the nucleus of a complete battalion of Kitchener's Army formed by the Borough of Grimsby known as the Grimsby Chums, later the 10th (Service) Bn, Lincolnshire Regiment.Simpson, pp. 53‚Äì4. 1/5th Battalion =Ypres Salient= The 1/5th Lincolns landed at Le Havre on 1 March 1915 and by 8 March the North Midland Division had completed its concentration ‚Äì the first complete TF formation to arrive on the Western Front. It was numbered the 46th (North Midland) Division in May, when the Lincolnshire & Leicestershire Brigade was numbered 138th (Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade. However, on arrival at Ploegsteert in the Ypres Salient, the two Lincolnshire battalions were attached to the Regulars of 11th Brigade in 4th Division for instruction in trench duties. They went into the line for the first time on 9 April opposite Spanbroekmolen. The battalion's first task was to keep the German trenches under fire on 17 April to assist an attack on Hill 60. On 20 May the Germans exploded a mine under 1/5th Bn's trenches, killing 11 men (and four missing, believed killed) and wounding 22. On 6 June the Royal Engineers detected and destroyed another mine beneath the battalion before the Germans could blow it.Simpson pp. 103‚Äì5. The battalion was not involved in the 46th Division's first action (the German flamethrower attack at Hooge on 30‚Äì31 July 1915), but was under heavy shellfire during this period, and was mined again on 26 September, suffering numerous casualties.Simpson, pp. 106, 124. =Hohenzollern Redoubt= The Hohenzollern Redoubt, 1915 The 1/5th Bn was in the forefront of the attack on the Hohenzollern Redoubt in October 1915. This was an attempt to restart the failed Battle of Loos, and the division was moved down from Ypres on 1 October for the purpose. The Germans had recaptured the Hohenzollern Redoubt on 1 October after severe fighting, and had driven off a hastily-organised British attack.Rawson, pp. 109‚Äì16.Cherry, pp. 253‚Äì8. 46th (North Midland) Division was ordered to make a prepared attack on 13 October.Rawson, p. 120.Cherry, p. 266.Simpson, p. 125. 46th (North Midland) Division attacking the Hohenzollern Redoubt, 13 October 1915; a cloud of smoke and gas appears in the centre and left The battalion took over its place in the line on the night of 12/13 October. The preliminary bombardment began at noon on 13 October, a gas cloud was discharged from the British trenches at 13.45, and the troops went over the top at 14.00. 1/5th Lincolns formed the left half of 138th Bde's attack, advancing in four waves, the first two platoons of each company jumping off from the front line, the other two from the support line. The battalion's objective was Fosse Trench, about 400 yards behind the Hohenzollern Redoubt. The barbed wire in front of the redoubt was well cut and the leading waves of the battalion swept over its east and west faces with little difficulty until they reached the dead ground between the redoubt and Fosse Trench, which was open and swept by rifle and machine gun fire from the front and both flanks, particularly from Mad Point out to the left. The attack melted away, although isolated parties maintained themselves in shell holes, including Sergeant Harry Drewery with the only surviving machine gun team, who set up in a German communication trench and stayed in action until evening. (Drewery was awarded the DCM and his gunner, Private Percy Coulson the MM.) The CO, Lt-Col T.E. Sandall, was among the wounded. At dusk the battalion's survivors under the only unwounded officer, Captain R.E. Madge, withdrew to the redoubt, which the support battalion (1/4th Lincolns) and the divisional pioneers (1st Bn Monmouthshire Regiment) were consolidating for defence. The Germans put down a heavy bombardment on the east face, obliterating the defences, and the survivors had to retreat to the west face, which they held throughout the night until relieved next morning. (Corporal C. Leadbeater won a bar to his previous DCM for consolidating a point in the north face, defending it with Hand grenades through the night, and then acting as a stretcher bearer when the battalion withdrew; several other MMs were slo awarded.) The battalion had lost 22 out of 23 officers in action, and 461 other ranks, killed and wounded.Sandall, pp. 46‚Äì52.Simpson, pp. 125-30.Cherry, pp. 292‚Äì3, 296.Rawson, pp. 125‚Äì8.MacDonald, pp. 41‚Äì4. After the disaster, the 46th Division undertook trench-holding duties and absorbed drafts of reinforcements until 23 December, when it was ordered to Egypt. The 1/5th Lincolns entrained for Marseilles and embarked on the troopship HMT Anchises on 8 January 1916, reaching Alexandria on 13 January. However, the movement was immediately cancelled, and the troops disembarked next day and went into camp. However, the division's move to Egypt was countermanded on 21 January and the units that had arrived were re- embarked. The 1/5th Lincolns boarded HMT Megantic at Alexandria on 2 February to return to France on 5 February. The battalion landed on 9 February and the division had reassembled near Amiens by 14 February. The 46th Division went back into the line in the Vimy sector, where 1/5th Bn was involved in a sharp fight when the Germans blew a mine under the parapet of their trench on 12 March.Sandall, pp. 58‚Äì61.Simpson, pp. 130-1.MacDonald, pp. 49‚Äì50.Anon, Robin Hoods, pp. 146‚Äì59.Milne, pp. 58‚Äì63. The battalion had been badly hit by sickness and was at less than half its establishment strength, and so was primarily used for fatigue duties. In April it received a strong draft from home, enabling it to take its place in the line, and Lt-Col Sandall returned to resume command.Sandall, pp. 63‚Äì5.MacDonald, p. 75; Appendix 3. =Gommecourt= In May the division moved south to take part in the forthcoming offensive on the Somme. It was ordered to assault the north side of the Gommecourt Salient on 1 July 1916. The operation, in conjunction with the 56th (1st London) Division attacking from the south, aimed at cutting off the salient, but was in fact a diversion for the main attack a few miles south that opened the Battle of the Somme.MacDonald pp. 57‚Äì65.Middlebrook, Somme, p. 73.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 252‚Äì9, 308. Training for the assault was carried out in Lucheux Forest during May, and in the weeks before the attack the battalion was engaged in fatigue duties, trench-digging, and taking turns in the front line, suffering a trickle of casualties.Sandall, pp. 66‚Äì73.MacDonald, pp. 88‚Äì92, 140‚Äì7, 165, 210. When the attack went in on 1 July, 138th Bde was in reserve; however, the assault by 137th (Staffordshire) and 139th (Sherwood Foresters) Bdes was a failure. At 08.30, the 1/5th Lincolns moved up cross-country in 'Artillery Formation' and took up positions in Midland Trench, the attacking brigades' original assembly position. It remained there for 12 hours under artillery fire, losing 10 men killed and one wounded. At 20.30 it was ordered to send forward patrols to try to get in touch with any of the Sherwood Foresters who might be holding out in the German frontline trenches, and then at 21.00 it was ordered to make an attack to seize those trenches at midnight. The battalion struggled up through choked communication trenches through Foncquevillers to relieve 139th Bde. The situation was chaotic and Sergeant Hamp, acting commander of a platoon, refused to advance without clear orders (he was not punished, and was subsequently promoted). The advance into No man's land in the dark found the German wire uncut and none of 137th or 139th Bde in the enemy lines. The battalion was eventually ordered to retire, bringing back wounded from No man's land. The abortive movement had cost a further 48 casualties.Sandall, pp. 74‚Äì8.Simpson, pp. 170‚Äì1.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 465, 474.MacDonald, pp. 463‚Äì70.Middlebrook, Somme, pp. 242‚Äì3. The battalion spent the following days clearing up the front line, with several men winning gallantry medals for their work in bringing in casualties from No man's land. It was relieved on 11 July.Sandall, pp. 79‚Äì82.Simpson, p. 172.MacDonald, pp. 479‚Äì80. Through the summer of 1916 and the subsequent winter the battalion took its turn in holding trenches at Foncquevillers and Berles-au-Bois. On 18 October, A Company launched a successful trench raid, supported by artillery, into the enemy lines.Sandall, pp. 83‚Äì104. Early 1917 saw the 46th Division still holding the line in the same area. However, at the beginning of March, patrols found that the Germans were beginning to retreat from the Gommecourt defences. The division followed up as the enemy retreated as far as their new Hindenburg Line defences well beyond the Somme battlefields. 46th Division was withdrawn from the pursuit on 17 March. It spent some time clearing the battlefield of 1 July 1916 and burying the dead who had been lying in No man's land for almost 10 months.Sandall, pp. 105‚Äì9.MacDonald, pp. 559‚Äì6. =Lens and Hill 70= In April 1917 the division moved to the Lens area and became involved in 10 weeks' bloody fighting round Hill 70. On 23 April, patrols of the battalion had the unaccustomed experience of street fighting while supporting an attack by 139th Bde on Hill 65. Until the battalion was relieved on 6 May, casualties were suffered from shelling and raiding, and several men were decorated for their actions in the confused fighting. 1/5th Lincolns took further turns in the line, with active patrolling and raiding, and full battalion attacks on 19 June (costing 74 casualties) and 30 June (51 casualties in taking Cit√© de Moulin). The division handed over to the 2nd Canadian Division in early July, having secured the jumping-off positions from which the Canadian Corps launched the successful Battle of Hill 70 in August.Campbell-Johnston.Sandall, pp. 110‚Äì35.Simpson, pp. 239‚Äì46.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, p. 114. 46th (North Midland) Division was not used offensively again until September 1918, spending its time in tours of duty holding the front line in quiet sectors. When 2/5th Lincolns was disbanded on 31 July 1918 (see below), the 1/5th Bn absorbed the remnants, reverting to the title of 5th Lincolns. =St Quentin Canal= The division was given the most difficult task in the Battle of the St. Quentin Canal on 29 September 1918: it had to cross the canal itself, where it constituted part of the Hindenburg Line. The crossing was to be made by 137th (Staffordshire) Bde, with 138th (Lincoln & Leicester) Bde following up and then attacking towards the second objective. Zero hour was at 05.50, when the Staffordshires moved out behind a creeping barrage, quickly captured the German front line trenches, crossed the canal, and consolidated on the first objective (the 'Red Line') under the protection of a standing barrage. The other two brigades then crossed the canal, and when the barrage began to roll forward again at 11.20, the 5th Lincolns followed with support from four tanks of 9th Bn Tank Corps, gaining its objective of Magny-la-Fosse and the high ground beyond at 12.30. It made contact with 139th Bde on the right and with the 30th US Division and 5th Australian Division on the left. The 1/5th Leicesters passed through to take the final objective at 13.50. The 5th Lincolns had taken large numbers of prisoners at small cost to itself (5 killed and 56 wounded).Priestley, pp. 61‚Äì80.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, p. 104.Sandall, pp. 175‚Äì8.Simpson, pp. 367‚Äì9.Yockelson, pp. 180‚Äì1. =Ramicourt= The 46th Division went into action again on 3 October at Ramicourt, where it penetrated the German Beaurevoir Line. C and D Companies of the battalion were sent up from reserve to repel a German counter-attack, but the furthest positions at Montbrehain and the summit of 'Mannequin Hill' could not be held. There were several casualties from shellfire and the brigade spent the night under attack by German aircraft using parachute flares.Sandall, p. 179.Simpson, pp. 369‚Äì70.Milne, pp. 144‚Äì49.Priestley, pp. 96‚Äì120.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 160‚Äì3. =Andigny= The Battle of Andigny on 17 October (part of the Battle of the Selle) was 46th Division's last general action of the war. 138th and 139th Brigades advanced through 6th Division and followed the barrage towards the objective. Direction keeping in the morning mist was difficult, and German machine gunners resisted fiercely, but 138th Bde overran the enemy's wire and trenches and 5th Bn was on its intermediate line by 08.00. However, it was slightly to the right of the objective, so that Andigny les Fermes on the left remained untaken. However, pressure from elsewhere led the Germans to evacuate the village by 15.30, and a line of platoon strongpoints and outposts was established.Sandall, pp. 184‚Äì7.Simpson, pp. 378‚Äì9.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 300‚Äì3.Priestley, pp. 147‚Äì53. After a few days' rest, the division joined the pursuit of the retreating enemy (the Battle of the Sambre). At the Petit Helpe river on the night of 6/7 November, 5th Lincolns found the bridges washed away, and A Company improvised a crossing by throwing carts, planks and ladders across the stream, while civilians from the other bank did the same. The other companies had to fell trees and took longer to get over, but the battalion was across and formed up for its advance by 08.00, meeting little opposition. The Armistice came into force on 11 November.Simpson, pp. 383‚Äì6. The battalion was stationed at Bousies until February 1919, engaged in salvage work. demobilisation began on 1 February, and parties departed for home daily from then on. In April parties were transferred to Prisoner of war escort companies and the battalion was reduced to a cadre at Inchy. The cadre left France on 24 June and paraded in Grimsby on 29 June when it deposited the battalion's colours in the parish church.Sandall, p. 194. The battalion was formally disembodied on 2 July 1919 =Commanding officers= The following officers commanded 5th and 1/5th Bns during the war: * Lt-Col T.E. Sandall, CMG, 11 May 1912 ‚Äì 13 October 1915 (wounded); 6 April 1916 ‚Äì 2 May 1917Sandall, pp. 52, 64, 114.Simpson, p. 239. * Lt-Col P.T. Westmorland (Royal Warwickshire Regiment), 7 November 1915 ‚Äì 30 April 1916Sandall, pp. 54, 63. * Lt-Col H.A.

Wilson, DSO, (former 2nd-in-command) 30 June 1918 ‚Äì 29 June 1919.Sandall, p. 166. 2/5th Battalion The 2nd Line battalion was formed on 16 February 1915 at Grimsby from men who had not volunteered for overseas service, together with the many new recruits under training. Mirroring its 1st Line parent, the battalion formed part of 2nd Lincoln & Leicester Brigade in 2nd North Midland Division; these were later numbered 177th (2/1st Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade and 59th (2nd North Midland) Division respectively. Training was carried out at Luton and later St Albans. There was a shortage of weapons and equipment. Eventually, the men were issued with .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles with which to train. These were not replaced with Lee-Enfield rifles until September 1915.Simpson, Appendix I.Anon, Robin Hoods, pp. 268‚Äì80. When the 59th Division began training for overseas service, the Home Service details of 2/5th Lincolns and other battalions of the 2nd Lincoln & Leicester Brigade went to the 28th Provisional Battalion, later the 13th Bn Lincolnshire Regiment, a home defence unit (see below).8th Provisional Brigade War Diary, The National Archives, Kew file WO 95/5458.Becke, Pt2 b, pp. 107‚Äì10. =Ireland= In the Spring of 1916 the 59th Division was the designated 'mobile division' in Home Forces, intended to repel German invasion of the East Coast, but on Easter Monday, 24 April, it was sent at a few hours' notice to Dublin to help quell the Easter Rising ‚Äì the first TF units to serve in Ireland. 177th (Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade went with Divisional HQ to Kingstown (D√∫n Laoghaire), where they landed on 28 April. The only serious fighting in Dublin fell to 178th (Sherwood Foresters) Brigade and in May 177th Bde was sent to Fermoy.Anon, Robin Hoods, pp. 281‚Äì96.Bradbridge, pp. 9‚Äì10, 39‚Äì41. The division remained in garrison in Ireland until the end of the year. With its units spread out in small garrisons, collective training was hindered. 59th Division returned to England in January 1917 and began final battle training at Fovant, where there was a large purpose-built camp on the edge of the Salisbury Plain training area. However, it never trained as a division, and when it was inspected before embarkation for active service, it was reported as being only partially trained. Nevertheless, it began moving to France in February.Bradbridge, pp. 6‚Äì7, 12‚Äì3, 47‚Äì8. =Hindenburg Line= 59th Division was fully concentrated around M√©ricourt near Amiens by 3 March. On the night of 13 March the 2/5th Lincolns had taken their place in the line, occupying a group of dug-outs in Triangle Wood, but the Germans began a planned retreat to the Hindenburg Line on 17 March, and the poorly-trained 59th had to follow up, patrolling and repairing roads. On 11 April the 2/5th Bn was ordered to make an immediate attack on 'The Quarry' and 'Cologne Farm' near Hargicourt, which the enemy were reported to be leaving. The attack was made at 04.30, but the report was false and the positions were strongly held. the battalion was forced back with very heavy casualties (260 killed, wounded and missing). A and C Companies, which had led the attack and suffered worst, had to be temporarily formed into a single composite company.Simpson, pp. 212-5Bradbridge, pp. 14, 49‚Äì52. There followed some weeks of trench duty in front of the Hindenburg Line, followed by intense training through the summer.Simpson, pp. 215‚Äì6.Bradbridge, pp. 15‚Äì8. =Polygon Wood= In September the division moved to the Ypres Salient to take part in its first full-scale action, the 3rd Ypres Offensive. The 59th relieved the 55th (West Lancashire) Division after its successful attack at the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge, and then took the lead in the next phase, the Battle of Polygon Wood (26 September). This was equally successful, with the Leicester battalions of 177th Bde advancing behind the smoke and dust of a creeping barrage and gaining their first objective without much opposition. The two Lincolnshire battalions then passed through to take the second objective, 2/5th Lincolns attacking with B company on the right, D on the left, C in support and A in reserve providing carrying parties. D Company met practically no resistance and dug a strongpoint north of 'Dochy Farm'. B Company attacked the farm, meeting machine gun and rifle fire, but worked round the flanks of the pillboxes with the help of a platoon from B Company, whereupon some 50 Germans surrendered to them. The battalion then consolidated a line of strongpoints, and deepened and connected a line of shell holes in rear of the strongpoints. German shellfire caused only a few casualties and the battalion was relieved that night. Although the attack had been a complete success, the battalion still suffered 16 killed, 210 wounded and 74 missing; of 584 officers and men who went into action, only 285 marched out.Simpson, pp. 264‚Äì6.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 288‚Äì9.Wolff, p. 199.Bradbridge, pp. 19‚Äì20. =Bourlon Wood= 59th Division was next moved south to join in the Battle of Cambrai. The division relieved the Guards Division on 28 November and the 2/5th Bn entered the recently captured Hindenburg Support Line near Flesqui√®res, losing a number of officers when a dugout was destroyed by shellfire. The 2/5th Bn was unaffected by the fierce German counter-attack on 30 November, and continued to dig in. But on 2 December it moved into the forward trenches in the south east corner of Bourlon Wood. Apart from heavy gas shelling this position was not attacked. However, by 4 December the decision had been made to withdraw from the dangerous Bourlon Salient, and 59th Division withdrew to the Flesqui√®res Ridge, the 2/5th Bn retiring by platoons without the enemy noticing. On 7 December the British were back on the line that they would hold for the coming winter.Simpson, pp. 276‚Äì79.Bradbridge, pp. 21‚Äì2.Miles, pp. 167, 213, 226, 262‚Äì7. =German Spring Offensive= The German Spring Offensive opened on 21 March while the division was in the Bullecourt sector of the line with 177th Bde in reserve. The brigade was ordered to advance across country in artillery formation to take up its allotted positions in the support line. At noon the 2/5th Lincolns was ordered to occupy the second line trenches, but found that the enemy had overrun the Sherwood Foresters in the morning mist and was already in the second line. Before the battalion could extend its line, three companies were cut off at Noreuil and were never seen again: 49 men were killed and all the rest were captured. The remaining company withdrew and took up positions in the partially-dug third line.Simpson, pp. 298‚Äì9.Blaxland, p. 48.Middlebrook, Kaiser's Battle, p. 254‚Äì6 & Appendix 8.Anon, Robin Hoods, pp. 411‚Äì5.Bradbridge, pp. 24‚Äì6. Despite its losses, 177th Bde remained in action on 22 and 23 March under the command of 40th Division. 2/5th Lincolns consisted of just 5 officers and about 80 other ranks. It held positions north west of Vraucourt until forced to retire to the Army Line at 16.00 on 22 March, and then again to Mory at 20.00. On 23 March the brigade had to withdraw over 5-600 yards of open ground under intense machine-gun fire, losing more men, before digging in, when they were relieved by 40th Division. During the battle the 2/5th Bn's casualties had amounted to about 510 all ranks.Simpson, pp. 301‚Äì10.Bradbridge, pp. 26, 170‚Äì1. The battalion was made up to four companies with drafts, but most of these were not Midlanders, and there was no time to integrate them. The 59th Division now went to the Ypres sector. On 15 April the battalion was called forward to hold positions on the Ravetsberg Ridge. Each company had a platoon in an advanced post on the forward slope while the remaining platoons dug in on the reverse slope. At 06.00 on 15 April enemy patrols approached the positions, and at noon a heavy bombardment began. At 14.45 the enemy advanced behind an intense barrage but were held off with Lewis gun and rifle fire. At 16.30 the 4th Lincolns on the left was forced back, but it formed a defensive flank and maintained contact with the 2/5th Bn. At 17.25 the enemy broke through the 4th Bn and got behind the left flank of the 2/5th Bn while a frontal attack was made simultaneously. D Company on the left was overrun after desperate fighting. The remainder of the battalion formed a flank but was forced back to join the rest of 177th Bde north-east of Bailleul. 177th Brigade withdrew to Locre that night. The battalion's casualties in this action (the Battle of Bailleul) were 356.Simpson, pp. 319‚Äì22.Bradbridge, pp. 27‚Äì8. The weak 2/5th Bn was formed into a composite battalion with 4th Lincolns under the command of Maj R.N. Holmes of the 4th. 'Holmes's Battalion' formed part of 'James's Force', about 2000 men drawn from the 59th Division, which served with 49th (West Riding) Division. The composite battalion suffered further casualties while digging positions near Locre on 17‚Äì19 April.Simpson, pp. 324‚Äì5. By now the 59th Division had suffered such heavy losses that it was temporarily disbanded in May and its battalions reduced to cadres sent to train new drafts at St Omer. 2/5th Lincolns was briefly attached to 30th Division and then to the 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division. The battalion was disbanded on 31 July and the remnants sent to the 1/5th Bn (see above).30 Division at Long, Long Trail.66 Division at Long, Long Trail.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 72.Bradbridge, pp. 29, 171. 3/5th Battalion This battalion was formed on 17 April 1915 at Grimsby. It became the 5th Reserve Bn on 8 April 1916 and on 1 September 1916 it was absorbed by the 4th Reserve Bn in the North Midlands Reserve Brigade at Saltfleet, Lincolnshire. 13th Battalion The Home Service men of the TF battalions of the Lincolns, Leicesters and South Staffordshire Regiment were formed into 28th Provisional Battalion at Southend-on-Sea in June 1915, forming part of 8th Provisional Brigade for coastal defence. The Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign Service distinction, whereupon all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit. The role of the Provisional Battalions changed to physical conditioning to render men fit for drafting overseas. 8th Provisional Brigade became 72nd Division, with 28th Provisional Bn assigned to 215th Brigade. On 1 January 1917 the 28th Provisional Battalion became the 13th Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment at Bedford. In May 1917 it moved to Ipswich. It was disbanded on 31 October 1917.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 107‚Äì10.Porter Interwar The 5th Lincolns was reconstituted in the TF (renamed Territorial Army (TA) in 1921) on 16 February 1920, once more forming part of 138th (Lincolnshire and Leicestershire) Brigade in 46th (North Midland) Division.Titles and Designations.Sandall, p. 198. The sub-units were distributed as follows:Sandall, p. 199. * A Company ** 1, 2, 3 & 4 Platoons at Grimsby * B Company ** 5 & 6 Platoons at Louth ** 7 Platoon at Alford ** 8 Platoon at Spilsby * C Company ** 9, 10 & 11 Platoons at GainsboroughGainsborough at Drill Hall Project ** 12 Platoon at Barton-on- Humber * D Company ** 13, 14 & 15 Platoons at Scunthorpe ** 16 Platoon at Brigg It was found that recruiting was excellent at Gainsborough and poor at Grimsby and Brigg, so Barton was assigned to A Company until the machine-gun platoon was established, and the platoon at Brigg (which had no drill hall) was abolished. The band, signallers, pioneers and transport section were also raised at Gainsborough. During the coal strike of April 1921 a temporary Defence Force was formed, with one unit being raised at the 5th Lincolns' HQ and then concentrated at the former Royal Naval Air Station Killingholme. This event spurred recruitment to the TA unit after the Defence Force was stood down.Sandall, pp. 200‚Äì2. In November 1933 the battalion re-established a drill station at Brigg, and recruitment there was now so successful that within two years the hired accommodation was inadequate and the Lincolnshire TA Association and War Office (WO) built a new detachment HQ.WO to HM Treasury, 18 November 1935, TNA file T 161/634. 46th (Lincolnshire Regiment) AA Battalion In December 1936 the 46th (North Midland) Division was disbanded and its headquarters was reconstituted as 2 Anti-Aircraft Division to control the increasing number of anti-aircraft (AA) units being created north of London. At the same time, several of its infantry battalions were converted into searchlight (S/L) battalions of the Royal Engineers (RE). The 5th Lincolns was one of these, becoming 46th (The Lincolnshire Regiment) Anti- Aircraft Battalion, RE (TA), with HQ and 382, 384 and 385 AA Companies at Grimsby, while 383 AA Company drew its personnel from Barton and Brigg. It formed part of 31st (North Midland) Anti-Aircraft Group in 2 AA Division.Frederick, pp. 859, 867.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 110, 114. After the Royal Artillery (RA) renamed its gun 'brigades' as 'regiments', the group was redesignated 31st AA Brigade in November 1938. 90 cm Projector Anti-Aircraft, displayed at Fort Nelson, Hampshire Second World War Mobilisation The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. Upon mobilisation, 46th AA Bn (with 383, 384 and 385 AA Cos) was part of 39th AA Bde in 2 AA Division covering the Humber and Scunthorpe. By October the regiment was controlling 306 AA Co from 27th (London Electrical Engineers) AA Bn as well as all four of its own companies. In November, 306 AA Company moved into the Grimsby area to make that a lighted Gun Zone. In February 1940, 306 and 383 AA Cos took over eight S/L sites on the East Coast that were positioned to pick up low-flying aircraft laying Parachute mines in the mouth of the Humber.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378.39 AA Bde War Diary 1939‚Äì41, TNA file WO 166/2272. In March and April 1940, the battalion (less 384 AA Co) handed its S/L sites over to 30th (Surrey) AA Bn and moved to the Newcastle upon Tyne area under 7 AA Division, where it took over sites from 37th (Tyne Electrical Engineers) AA Bn at Newcastle, Morpeth and Sunderland. RA collar badge Battle of Britain and Blitz When the RE's AA battalions were transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA) in August 1940, the battalion became 46th (Lincolnshire Regiment) Searchlight Regiment, RA, retaining its Lincolns cap badge, although officers wore RA collar badges. The AA companies were redesignated S/L batteries.Farndale, Annex M, p. 339.Litchfield, pp. 143‚Äì4.46 S/L Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. By now the Battle of Britain was on; the regiment had transferred to 57 Light AA Bde in 7 AA Division and served with it during the Blitz, including the raids on Newcastle (the Newcastle Blitz).7 AA Division at RA 39‚Äì45.Farndale, Annex D.Routledge Table LXV, p. 397.Order of Battle of Non- Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79. The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 234th S/L Training Rgt at Carlisle where it provided the basis for a new 540 S/L Bty formed on 12 December 1940. This battery later joined a newly- forming 88th S/L Rgt.Frederick, p. 861. 3 AA Divisional formation sign In December 1941 the regiment moved north to Scotland when it transferred to 36 (Scottish) AA Bde in 3 AA Division covering Edinburgh and the Forth.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80. In August 1942 it moved further north still, and joined 58 AA Bde in the Orkney and Shetland Defences (OSDEF).Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82.

Then in July, 382 S/L Bty under Major P.J.T. Haxby moved to the far end of the United Kingdom and was attached to 103 AA Bde (a field force formation) in Cornwall, with Bty HQ at Truro, A Trp at Rosemullion, B Trp at RAF St Eval, C Trp at RAF Portreath and D Trp at RAF Predannack.103 AA Bde War Diary May‚ÄìDecember 1943, TNA file WO 166/11252. The regiment left OSDEF in October 1943 and transferred to 60 AA Bde in 3 AA Group covering South West England. By now, AA Command was being forced to release manpower for overseas service, particularly Operation Overlord (the planned Allied invasion of Normandy) and most S/L regiments lost one of their four batteries. On 25 February 1944 385 S/L Bty began disbanding, completing the process by 24 March.Order of Battle of AA Command, 1 August 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/84.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, TNA file WO 212/85. North West Europe By the end of 1944, the German Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious aerial attacks on the UK could be discounted and the WO began disbanding surplus AA units and reorganising others into infantry battalions for duties in the rear areas. On 30 September 1944 384 Bty became independent, and on 8 October the remainder of the regiment was ordered to disband at Yealmpton, Devon. However, on 1 November the disbandment order was cancelled and 384 Bty rejoined. On 4 November 1944 RHQ with 382-4 Btys was converted into 46th (Lincolnshire Regiment) Garrison Regiment, RA.Frederick, pp. 879‚Äì80.46 Garrison Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. Meanwhile, 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe was suffering a severe manpower shortage, particularly among the infantry.Ellis, pp. 141‚Äì2. In January 1945, the WO accelerated the conversion of surplus artillery into infantry units, primarily for line of communication and occupation duties, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.Ellis, pp. 369, 380.Routledge, pp. 420‚Äì1. 46 Garrison Regiment was redesignated again, becoming 606 Infantry Regiment, RA in February. It went to North West Europe the following month and did duty with Second Army until VE Day.606 Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45.Joslen, p. 463. 606 Regiment was placed in suspended animation on 4 February 1946 in Belgium. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947 the regiment was reformed as 581 (5th Battalion Royal Lincolnshire Regiment) (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA ('mixed') indicating that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit). The Regimental HQ was at the TA Centre in Coldyhill Lane, Scunthorpe, with a detached battery at Barton on Humber.Frederick, p. 1024.564‚Äì591 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. It formed part of 57 AA Bde (the former 31 (North Midland) AA Bde, now headquartered at Immingham), but this was disbanded by September 1948.30‚Äì66 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947. In 1955, AA Command was disbanded and there were wholescale mergers among its units. 581st HAA joined 462 and 529 HAA and formed R (5th Bn Royal Lincolnshire Regiment) Battery in a new 440th (Humber) Light AA Rgt.Frederick, p. 1014. After the TA was reduced to the TAVR in 1967, 440 (Humber) Rgt became an infantry unit and was then reduced to a cadre. When it was reformed in 1971 the Lincolnshire Regiment link was discontinued.414‚Äì443 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, p. 250.

The major constituents of the arts include literature (poetry, novels, short stories, and epic poetry), performing arts (music, dance, and theatre), and the visual arts, the last of which includes creations that can be seen. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the term \\"creative\\" describes a quality of something created rather than imitated. In light of this, creative peacebuilding is a broad term for creative therapeutic strategies to create peace, within individuals, groups, and societies in conflict situations. Although used primarily to overcome violence, creative peacebuilding is also a preventative measure explored to establish stronger foundations of peaceful initiatives, especially when used with children.  Definitions of peacebuilding  Peacebuilding is a process that facilitates the establishment of sustainable peace by preventing the recurrence of violence through different approaches which address the root causes and effects of conflict. Peacebuilding is an alternative to violence through reconciliation, and economic and social transformation. The term peacebuilding has been widely used since 1992, when it was used by the former United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in his An Agenda for Peace. Boutros-Ghali described peacebuilding as \\"action to identify and support structures, which will tend to strengthen and solidify peace in order to avoid a relapse into conflict.\\" According to Johan Galtung, peacebuilding is the process of creating self-supporting structures that \\"remove causes of wars and offer alternatives to war in situations where wars might occur.\\" For John Paul Lederach, peacebuilding is a comprehensive concept that encompasses, generates, and sustains the full array of processes, approaches, and stages needed to transform conflict toward more sustainable, peaceful relationships, which involves a wide range of activities. It has a diverse range of interaction and involves various stakeholders in various levels within the spectrum of governance and development.  Peacebuilding through the visual arts  If visual arts are artistic expressions that can be seen in their diversity rather than heard, then the relationship between visual arts and creative peacebuilding is reflected in the felt experience of creative peacebuilding in conflict situations. Visual arts are created to stimulate visual experiences. They are employed to help individuals cope with their feelings and treat post-traumatic stress disorder. Creative peacebuilding through the visual arts is a process that facilitates the establishments of sustainable peace by preventing recurrence of violence, addresses the root causes, healing and effects of conflict, and offer alternatives to violence through reconciliation, economic and social transformation with the use of photography, film, painting, and the like. Jolyon Mitchell argues that the visual arts can both encourage peacebuilding and instigating violence. This is true of various forms of visual arts, ranging from posters, cartoons, and stained glass, to websites, radio, and films by reflecting on examples from around the world.  Photography  Photography is the science and art of creating durable images with light or other electromagnetic radiation, either through the use of an image sensor or chemical means of a light-sensitive. Susan Sontag opines that a photographer has the ability to create a reality by examining pictures. Photography is one of the forms of new media that changes perceptions and changes the structure of society. The objectivity and subjectivity of a photograph is sometimes problematic. Sontag argues, \\"To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. It means putting one's self into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge, and therefore like power.\\" Photographers decide what to photograph, what elements to exclude, and what angle to frame the photo, and these factors may reflect a particular socio-historical context. Along these lines, it can be argued that photography is a subjective form of representation. The visual quality of photographic images is particularly effective in grabbing, maintaining, and retaining viewers' attention. It is commonly stated that a picture is worth a thousand words. In the context of creative peacebuilding, the visual qualities of photographic images provide specific benefits. The power of an image to establish an objective work is the sole judge of the message the viewer's read. Subjective truth makes it an effective tool for peacebuilding. Images span generations, languages, and cultural differences. Different people can easily engage with the characters or situations presented to them, regardless of their background. Pictures are both cognitively and emotionally compelling ‚Äì a process that is essential to peacebuilding mechanism. The power of image is also condition by its design and purpose. Furthermore, photographic contents and images are employed to negotiate issues of the past in creative ways highlighting the incidents, experiences, emotions, and themes thus fostering alternative imagination of the future that will help to sustain peace. Photography promotes freedom of participation, access, and engagement, which is within the control of the viewer, and also opens up process for peacebuilding. At their discretion and their pace, the viewer engages and reflects on their experiences, while seeing and dwelling in the experience of others. Such an experience often creates the need to revisit the picture.  Websites  Jolyon Mitchell has written about how websites have been used as a medium for promoting peace on the screen. Through the web, the world has become a global village. Therefore, websites can be created to facilitate peacebuilding. It offers a virtual location whereby individuals can login, get information, take action, and post and share issues to aid in peacebuilding.

Despite having Express in its name, the train served as many local stations between Arifiye and Ankara and was popular among students due to its low fare. History The Boƒüazi√ßi Express waiting to depart Haydarpa≈üa station in 1968, before electrification of the route. The Boƒüazi√ßi Express made its inaugural run from Haydarpa≈üa Terminal in Istanbul to Ankara station in Ankara on 1 June 1968 with brand new railcars from CIWL as one of the State Railways' premier trains. The cost of a single ticket was 32 liras ($3.55 at the time), while a round-trip ticket cost 56 liras ($6.22).Milliyet, 10 June 1968, p. 2 Motive power for the train was diesel for the entire route, even after of track from Istanbul to Arifiye was electrified in 1977. The train was the victim of several accidents during its lifetime, most notably on 4 January 1979 near Esenkent when the train collided with the Anatolian Express, killing 19 and injuring 124 people.Milliyet, 6 January 1979, p. 1 When TCDD electrified the entire Istanbul-Ankara railway in December 1993, the Boƒüazi√ßi Express was given electric motive power. The first electrified train, pulled by E40002, departed Haydarpa≈üa at 08:00 on 26 December 1993. TCDD also equipped its new TVS2000 railcars, that had been built in order to improve the railway's image. The limited express service of the train changed a few years later and became one of the local intercity trains operating between Istanbul and Ankara, stopping at most stations. On 25 August 2004, TCDD discontinued the train citing low ridership, however after a public backlash occurred the train was revived and began operations on 27 September. Once the Ankara-Eski≈üehir high-speed railway was opened in March 2009, several trains operating between Istanbul and Ankara were cut back to Eski≈üehir. The Boƒüazi√ßi Express however, continued its full journey between the two cities until 1 February 2012, when it was shorted by from Istanbul to Arifiye, due to construction works between Gebze and Sapanca for high-speed train service. Two months later, on 2 April, the train was shortened again, this time from Ankara to Eski≈üehir, due construction for Ankara's Ba≈ükentray commuter rail service. The Boƒüazi√ßi Express ran between Arifiye and Eski≈üehir () for two more years until it was discontinued on 24 July 2014 with the opening of the Istanbul-Eski≈üehir extension of the Istanbul-Ankara high-speed railway.

She was actively involved in negotiations with the Swiss cantons to discontinue the occupation and regain access to the county, and when she became widowed in 1516, her position of negotiations improved.

Despite two earlier inquiries, their conditions of service were basically those that had been established for the colonial civil service before independence. After the ending of autocratic rule by Dr. Banda, the main aid donors insisted on civil service modernisation and reform in line with Free market concepts promoted by the International Monetary Fund at that time. In the event, the report advocated substantial pay increases to attract suitable recruits, but these proposals were never fully implemented. Civil service reform in Malawi has been proposed several times since its independence but has generally failed because of the country‚Äôs lack of sufficient well-trained managers willing to enter the civil service.Tambusi, pp. 5-12 Background In 1891, the whole of what is now Malawi became a British protectorate, later called Nyasaland. Over the next sixty years its administration consisted of a small number of senior European civil servants appointed by the Colonial Office or Crown Agents on expatriate contracts, and a larger number of junior African civil servants engaged on local contracts by the Nyasaland Government.McCracken, pp. 217-19 Nyasaland joined Northern and Southern Rhodesia in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. This introduced a third group of civil servants, those working for departments of the Federal government, who were employed from within the Federation and did not have expatriate status: they included both Europeans and Africans.Pike, p. 208 McCracken, p. 276 Skinner Report During the period of Federation, a number of Nyasaland Africans became Federal civil servants and reached middle- ranking and senior positions, but enjoyed lower salaries and fewer benefits than colleagues on expatriate contracts. Once the Federation was dissolved and the country progressed towards full independence as Malawi, its new African majority government commissioned a Local Civil Service Commission of Inquiry in 1963, whose report, the Skinner Report, aimed to bring order to the different pay rates for local civil servants, including the integration of former Federal civil servants. The Skinner report recommended raising the salaries of the lower-paid civil servants but enrolling them in a compulsory pension scheme, and reducing the salaries of the highest paid while leaving mid-level salaries unchanged. Other cost-saving measures included eliminating or reducing a number of allowances for middle and higher-level officers and increasing charges for their government housing.Power, p. 284 Although members of the Malawi Congress Party agitated for the wholesale replacement of expatriate civil servants by Malawians, Prime Minister Banda insisted on their retention until suitably-qualified Malawians were available. British-recruited expatriate officers were generally cushioned against the effects of reductions in their salaries or allowances through payments by the British Government.McCracken, pp. 403, 423-5Power, p. 284 Some more contentious aspects of the Skinner reforms were modified in 1965,McCracken, p. 454 but they remained the basis of civil service pay and allowances until in 1983, despite a large increase in staff numbers. The Malawi Government requested British Government Assistance in forming an Independent Civil Service Review Commission in that year.Corkery, pp. 208-9 Herbecq Report This commission was to examine the structure, staffing and training of the Malawi Civil Service, and suggest improvements. It chairman was Sir John Herbecq, a retired senior British civil servant, and the commission reported in 1985, identifying some weaknesses and recommending solutions. However, although the Malawi Government accepted this report, it took little action on it. The Herbecq Report highlighted poor civil service performance arising from the inadequate definition of responsibilities, poor training, ineffective evaluation of projects and poor financial management. It also concluded pay levels were too low to attract the best professional and technical candidates, but noted overstaffing and excessive staff turnover at lower levels. By 1992, the real value of civil service salaries was only half their 1982 levels, although this fall was partly offset by non-cash benefits such as subsidised housing.Anders, (2001) p. 46 Following the 1993 referendum that ended the autocratic rule of Dr. Banda, free elections in 1994, civil service strikes and two critical World Bank reports relating to the use of Structural adjustment loans that criticised the management of the Malawi Civil Service and its pay levels, and which recommended reducing the number of junior officers and support staff, the incoming government of Bakili Muluzi was forced to take action, by an immediate increase to junior officers‚Äô salaries and by agreeing to an independent inquiry.Corkery, pp. 209-10Anders, (2001) p. 46 The Chatsika Commission Muluzi appointed Justice Lewis Chatsika, who had first been appointed a judge of Malawi‚Äôs High Court in 1970 and of its Supreme Court in 1990, where he was noted for his courageous independence of the Banda regime.Kalinga, pp. 79-80 The commission he headed (Chatsika Commission) delivered its report in March 1995. It recommended substantial salary increases: 263 percent for the lowest grades, 120 percent for middle grades and 236 percent for the most senior civil servants. It recognised that implementing these proposal would result in a doubling of the civil service salary bill, but was convinced this was necessary, despite the likely objections of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Corkery, p. 210 Although the World Bank and the IMF accepted that the value of civil service pay had declined sharply in the decade up to 1995, they put pressure on president Muluzi not to implement the Chatsika Commission in full or immediately, but to promise to increase the salaries of all grades by 25 percent when circumstances allowed.Durvall and Erlandsson, pp. 14-5 Aftermath In April 1997, civil servants demanded implementation of the commission‚Äôs recommendations and many went on strike, although this strike soon collapsed. Instead of meeting these demands, the government began increasing all salaries by 25 percent each year, although this did little more than countering inflation.Corkery (1998), pp. 216-7, 224 In addition, the government set up a Public Service Change Management Agency in 1997 to supervise the reduction of the size of the Malawi Civil Service and related public services from around 30,000 employees to 16,000 by 2000. This was accomplished but caused widespread unrest among junior civil service ranks and many spontaneous if localised strikes.Anders, (2014) pp. 336, 344 The failure of recent attempts at civil service reform in Malawi has been attributed to the insistence of aid donors such the World Bank and the IMF on forcing the adoption a single solution, without recognising local conditions. The donors‚Äô template for reform involves the adoption of such private-sector concepts as creating specific performance targets and devolving authority to managers, regardless of whether sufficient appropriately trained managers exist.Tambusi, pp. 5, 10-11 Attempts at reform have also lead to polarisation between high- ranking civil servants, able to benefit from the reforms, and the mass of their juniors, paid low salaries, often in arrears, and lacking job security.Anders, (2001) p. 60 References Sources *G.

She returned to Philadelphia in 1986. Following the award of her degree, Dr. Garfinkel assumed teaching positions at the University of Pennsylvania and Temple University. Garfinkel was especially interested in using yoga to treat diseases of the hand, including osteoarthritis as well as repetitive strain injuries. Dr. Garfinkel had a great love for music and took in many Temple and Curtis Institute music students as private yoga students, most of whom addressed her as \\"Dr. G.\\" She also helped different professional musicians from Philadelphia and New York with their physical problems. In 2016, Garfinkel's extensive archives regarding B. K. S. Iyengar were donated to the Iyengar Yoga National Association of the United States (IYANUS). Garfinkel is a senior certified Iyengar teacher who was a student of B. K. S. Iyengar between 1974, when she first met him in Ann Arbor, MI, and his death in 2014. Marian Garfinkel in 2008 Research Garfinkel's 1992 Dissertationhttp://simson.net/ref/1992/MGarfinkel_1992.pdf showed that yoga and various relaxation techniques were a workable treatment for the pain and mobility issues associated with osteoarthritis.

Cast * Bae Jong-ok: the mother * Park Won-sang: the father * Park Ji-bin: Han-yi, the younger brother * Seo Dae-han: Han-byeol, the older brother suffering from cancer * Choi Woo-hyuk: Wook-yi, another young patient in the pediatric ward * Jeon Hye-jin: Han-yi's homeroom teacher * Oh Ji-hye: Wook- yi's mother * Choi Jin-ho: Dr. Na Yeong-soo * Yang Hyeon-woo Production Entertainment company MK Buffalo; . announced in August 2004 that it would invest ‚Ç©3.2 billion into the film, with ‚Ç©1.8 billion budgeted for production costs and ‚Ç©1.4 billion for marketing. In early September, the company began raising funds for production by public subscription over the internet, promising 80% minimum capital preservation and distribution of additional profits if domestic viewership exceeded 1.15 million. It was believed to be the first South Korean film to attempt to raise 100% of production funds from the public prior to beginning production; the 1999 film Happy End had raised a portion of its production funds in a similar way, while the 2003 film A Good Lawyer's Wife had previously raised funds from internet users after production was complete. However, on 8 September, South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) intervened and ordered MK Buffalo to cease public fundraising, stating that the company had violated the Indirect Asset Management Business Act. For an English translation of the law, see with its attempt to raise funds from the public without an asset management license, and possibly with its promise of capital preservation. The company announced the following day that it would comply with the order but that it did not agree that its activities violated the law. In November, MK Buffalo announced that it would restructure the internet fund as an anonymous partnership, a kind of contract similar to the German Stille Gesellschaft or the Japanese tokumei kumiai. in a second attempt to raise funds for the production from the public without violating securities regulations. Regulation of anonymous partnerships was not under the jurisdiction of the FSS; the Ministry of Finance and Economy regarded this as a loophole in investor protection laws but had no authority to intervene. MK Buffalo raised its increased target of ‚Ç©1.95 billion from 430 investors. Filming began on 11 October, while the funding controversy was still ongoing, and by 15 November the company stated it was roughly halfway complete. By early January, filming had not yet ended, though it was said to be 90% complete, with a target release date in late April. One particularly difficult scene was the one in which character Han-byeol first received cancer treatment, filmed at Chung-Ang University Medical Center. It was difficult to take smooth shots in the highly public setting, and work even had to be stopped temporarily due to complaints from patients and their visiting family members; combined with the emotional nature of the scene, this took its toll on the actors. Filming was completed on 20 January. The trailer was released on 6 February, and the poster on 1 April. Soundtrack work continued in March, with veteran singer Kim Jang-hoon and child actor Park Ji-bin recording a duet for release as a promotional music video. On 12 April, the release date was officially announced as 27 May. Release and reception An early screening of the film was held on 2 May for 600 people, including 80 of the 430 investors from whom MK Buffalo had raised funds. Investors had extremely optimistic expectations for their rate of return. Another special screening was held on 5 May for young patients at Asan Medical Center. Distribution rights for Japan, China (including Hong Kong), and Singapore were sold to Japanese company Shochiku for US$300,000 just prior to the film's South Korean release. Hello, Brother was expected to face stiff competition on its release date from Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith, which was released the previous day in South Korea. By 25 May, Star Wars III had sold 88.8% of its release day tickets through advance reservation, as compared to just 4.88% for Hello, Brother. It came in second place behind Star Wars III at the box office on its release weekend, with 316,705 viewers in 194 cinemas. Word-of-mouth contributed to the film's popularity and gave it a strong second week, including 219 thousand viewers during the long weekend for Memorial Day. The week after that it received another 122,881 viewers, breaking the one-million mark, though still short of the break-even point of 1.2 million viewers. By 19 June, after the fourth weekend, the film had received a total of 1,089,276 viewers, giving it enough revenue to cover the minimum guarantee of returning 80% of the initial capital to investors, but still short of returning profit. Prospects for future viewership were not bright; although it was not facing competition from other family films at the time, it had already been moved to the smallest screening hall in many cinemas.

Early life He was born in Valea cu ApƒÉ - FƒÉrcƒÉsesti, Gorj, the son of school teacher Dumitru Popescu. He attended the Normal School in Bucharest to become a teacher himself. After completing his studies he performed military service in the 18th Infantry Regiment Gorj, then returned to Valea cu ApƒÉ where he took his father's position. Participation in World War I At the beginning of 1916 he was concentrated in the army and followed a training course at the 21st Dorobanti Regiment in Bucharest. At the day Romania entered World War I on August 15, 1916, he was enlisted in the 18th Infantry Regiment under the command of Colonel Constantine Jipa. He commanded, at the rank of second lieutenant, platoon 3, of the third company of battalion I of this regiment. With his unit he participated in the Transylvanian campaign in 1916, fighting in the Jiu Gorge. He was wounded while fighting North of the city of Lupeni. After recovering, he returns to the command of his platoon. On 5 November 1916, near ≈¢icleni, most of the 18th Infantry Regiment, together with other Romanian regiments, was surrounded by the enemy and forced to surrender. Not wanting to fall prisoner, Popescu flees in the forests, trying to reach the Romanian tropes he was separated from. He urges his soldiers to do the same in order to avoid capture and internment in prison camps. Together with his company commander, Captain Gheorghe Gutuleanu and with sergeant Costea Aristica, he wandered for three days through the forests between RƒÉ≈üina and BrƒÉtuia, to VlƒÉduleni village, where the three separated. Victor Popescu tried to reach a Romanian detachment that he knew he was withdrawing to Turnu- Severin, but failed to find it, so he returned to his native village. Formation of the guerrilla group Wanted poster of Victor Popescu Ionel Popescu, WW I Romanian partisan (middle) with two friends while in Budapest in 1918. When he arrived home, he found out that the Germans plundered his home and tortured his father. On December 4, 1916 he killed the two responsible German soldiers, then killed the German sentinel at the headquarters of the German patrol, taking his gun and ammunition. From this point on, Popescu decides to becomes a guerrilla warrior to oppose the German occupant. From the people in the village, he learned that his former company commander, captain Gutuleanu, was captured by the Germans and sent to the Sopronny√©k prison camp in Austro-Hungary. He also learned that a local blacksmith named Hans, and villager Gheorghe Schism, were betraying him to the Germans. In response, Victor Popescu begins to assemble a partisan group to fight the Germans, within the areas of Gorj and Mehedinti. His comrades were brothers Dumitru and Ilie C√¢rciumaru, Iorgu CrƒÉciun, Vasile Velican, M. CƒÉrƒÉmidaru, all from Negomir, Nicolae Popescu, Tudor Popescu from Valea cu ApƒÉ, Gheorghe Ioana from Racovita-V√¢lcea, sergeant gendarme, Gheorghe SpƒÉtaru, from Negomir village, Ionel Popescu normalist and scout student, Ionel Prunescu, a student at the military school in Craiova, as well as escaped prisoners of war from the prisoners' camp in Turnu-Severin, Italians Alfredo Pellegrini and Dominico Prade, and some Russian escaped POWs. The number of those who joined him in the first phase of the guerrilla battle was between forty and one hundred and twenty combatants. The number of members of the group varied over time, increasing in the case of attacks, and declining when the enemy started to follow the partisans. The combatants were dressed in Romanian military or civilian uniforms, while the former Russian and Italian prisoners wear the uniforms as where they were captured by the Germans. As weapons they had rifles and machine guns leftover by the Romanian army during the retreat or, capture weapons taken from the Central Powers troops. The actions of the guerrilla group In the incursions made in the villages of the counties of Gorj and Mehedinti, Victor Popescu's group of partisans left, for misleading the enemy, leaflets addressed to the occupation forces, with the following content: \\"Today I passed through your village, I saw the miseries that you do to our brethren, we will soon pay you miserable what you are.\\" Tickets were signed with the names of senior Romanian officers, including General Alexandru Averescu, to suggest to the Germans that they are confronted with a large and well-organized Romanian force. The actions of the guerrilla group were diverse, ranging from assault with firearms to spreading manifestations that would mislead the opponents or intimidate them. On several occasions, in the villages of Corcova and Meris, Victor Popescu, disguised as a monk, spoke to the German patrols, drunk them, and took their weapons and ammunition while they were unconscious of too much drink. Besides, the Romanian sub-lieutenant walked through disguised villages in various forms: priest, carriage, pot- seller and others. In May 1917, Victor Popescu launched a Proclamation addressed to Romanians, village mayors and Romanian soldiers remaining behind the enemy front, urging them to fight with their gun and warning the Romanian traitors that they would be punished if they would enemy information. The Central Powers' occupation forces organized guerrilla arrests, mostly based on information provided by Romanian traitors. A reward was placed on Victor Popescu's head, amounting to 5,000 to 30,000 lei, depending on the value of the information that will lead to its capture. The enemy's injuries were mostly with no results, he suffered losses as a result of clashes with Romanian partisans. In some of these raids, the German patrols were able to capture two former Italian prisoners who fought alongside Victor Popescu, Alfredo Pellegrini and Dominico Prade. In others, they succeeded in killing some Romanian fighters, such as Ionel Prunescu and Gheorghe Ioana. Victor Popescu himself will be hurt in one of these struggles, but he will be able to save himself without being captured. Turnu-Severin prison on July 10, 1917. Among those who betrayed the group of Romanian partisans were Gheorghe Schinteie, Mayor of Dragotesti commune, Gheorghe Ro≈üoga, priest in the village of Pe≈üteana de Jos and Aftanghel Toma, monk. Gheorghe Schinteie will be shot dead by Victor Popescu as he led a Hungarian patrol to catch him. Aftanghel Toma betrayed Ionel Popescu, a member of the group of partisans, who was captured by the Austro-Hungarian troops and closed to the Raci village. Victor Popescu attacked the command and freed Ionel. A commando made up of partisans abducted the monk on the night of May 30/31, 1917 and after an interrogation he was executed by shooting, leaving a note near his dead body with the text: \\"so will all who betray their brethren and stand in the service of the enemy.\\" Other actions of the partisans include attacking enemy ammunition depots, blowing up a train of ammunition loaded with ammunition, and attacks on the Central Powers' troops, including those stationed the city of T√¢rgu Jiu. Because they have not been able to catch them even by betrayal, the military authorities of the occupation forces have resorted to reprisals on the families of guerrilla warriors. Victor Popescu's father, wife, sister and father-in-law were arrested, sentenced to death, and some of them executed by the enemy. Victor Popescu's house, in the village of Valea cu ApƒÉ, was spoiled and burnt on 24 June 1917, on the order of General von Knalzer. The house of Victor Popescu's father-in-law, N.D. Ple≈üan from the village of Cr√¢nguie≈üti, Mehedin≈£i County, was also robbed and burnt. From the villages of Valea cu ApƒÉ, Negomir, Groze≈üti, Covrigi, Pestera de Sus, Bolbo≈üi, Slivile≈üti, Stejerei, Rovinari, HorƒÉ≈üti, Samarine≈üti, Trestioara and others, hundreds of people were suspected of helping the partisans. They were locked at Turnu- Severin, and ten of them sentenced to death. Learning about the death sentence the people who helped him, Victor Popescu decides to attack the prison in Turnu-Severin to release the detainees who supported him. The partisan group attacked the prison on the night of July 6/7, 1917 and managed to break into its walls, whereby some of the prisoners manage to flee. Those sentenced to death, however, did not escape, and the attack on the prison hastened their execution by the Germans. On July 10, 1917, ten supporters of Victor Popescu were executed by firing squad after being forced to dig their own graves. These were Nicolae Marcu from Dragotesti, Nicolae Popescu, teacher from Covrigi, brother of Victor and father of Ionel Popescu, Constantin Cojocaru, notary in Negomir commune, Ion Norocea, Bolbo≈üi, Petre V√¢lceanu and Ion BrƒÉiescu, mayor and notar of Bolbo≈üi commune, Stancu Croitoru, Tudor Ungureanu, Ilie Giumanca, all from Groze≈üti and Mihai CernƒÉianu from HorƒÉ≈üti. Another eight men, both men and women, were sentenced to imprisonment, with penalties ranging from one to fifteen years. Several other dozens of people were imprisoned at the Tismana monastery, and ten were deported to Bulgaria. Either in prison or shortly after being released from detention, some died due to ill-treatment. Among them are the father of Victor Popescu, Dumitru, and the sister-in-law, Domnica, the wife of Nicolae Popescu, executed by the Germans on July 10, 1917. In August 1917, the group of partisans dissolved, most of whom returned to their homes. Victor Popescu passed to the counties of Olt and V√¢lcea, gathered a new group of five or six people, who went to Moldova in February when Victor Popescu arrived in Moldova at his regiment. After World War I At the end of 1918, after the end of the war, he returned to his native village where he resumed his teaching career. In 1941 he was decorated with the \\"Reward of Labor\\" medal for outstanding merits as a teacher, reviewer and school inspector. He retired in 1943. In 1948 Victor Popescu was fined for \\"propaganda against the regime\\" by the newly established communist authorities in the country. The one who denounced him to the authorities was the same priest Gheorghe Ro≈üoga, who in 1917 sold him to the Germans. In 1952 he was arrested by Communists and detained for one year at the Ghencea camp in Bucharest. The same authorities annulled their pension entitlement for the period 1948-1956, on the ground that they had been punished under Decree 102 of 1948. It was reinstated in 1956. Victor Popescu dies in 1970 at the age of 84, being buried in the native village cemetery. In 1986, historical film \\"Batalia din Umbra\\" based on Victor Popescu's guerrilla actions during the First World War was cast.

All five people in both aircraft were killed, including United States Senator John Heinz, the sole passenger of the Piper. Two school children on the ground were also killed by falling debris. In addition to the seven fatalities, five more people on the ground were injured. An investigation discovered the cause of the accident to be poor judgment and pilot error of the crews from both aircraft. Background Northeast Philadelphia Airport; destination of Heinz Piper Aerostar Heinz's Piper departed from Williamsport Regional Airport in central Pennsylvania at about 11:25 a.m. EST. Heinz was in Williamsport for a press conference pertaining to funding of U.S. Route 15. His press conference lasted about two and a half hours the morning of Thursday, April 4. Heinz rented the twin-engine Piper Aerostar from Lycoming Air based at the Williamsport airport, Heinz and his two pilots, both from Lycoming County, departed for Philadelphia just before 11:30 a.m. Crash As Heinz's aircraft neared Philadelphia, on final approach to Northeast Philadelphia Airport, pilot Richard Shreck noticed that the nose landing gear locked indicator was not illuminated. Shreck executed a missed approach and entered a holding pattern north of the airport. The two pilots began troubleshooting the problem and alerted air traffic control. A passing Sun Oil Company Bell 412 helicopter, headed to the company's headquarters, was enlisted to identify if the gear was indeed down and locked. The crew of the Bell 412 couldn't identify the condition of the landing gear from a safe distance so moved closer for a better look. At 12:10 p.m., the two aircraft collided over Merion Elementary in Lower Merion, with the helicopter's rotor clipping the left wing and fin of the Aerostar. The helicopter spun out of control and the Aerostar dived to the ground, disintegrating on impact in the elementary school grounds. Two schoolgirls were killed and five others injured by the debris, which fell in a radius around the school and surrounding area. Investigation An NTSB and FAA Investigation was opened almost immediately. In 1992, the National Transportation Safety Board's finding were announced. It was determined that the \\"appallingly poor judgment\\" of both flight crews caused the accident. The report later claimed that visual checks of the aircraft from the helicopter were pointless because it is impossible to see into the nose-wheel well of an Aerostar from a helicopter to check whether the nose-gear is locked. The board's investigators recited a long litany of the mistakes and wrong decisions that led to the deaths and injuries. \\"This was a senseless accident that didn‚Äôt have to happen,\\" said James L. Kolstad, chairman of the five- member National Transportation Safety Board at the time. The official description of the accident as released by both the NTSB and FAA conclude that the incident was caused by poor judgment and pilot error of crews on the Aerostar and Bell helicopter. The helicopter crew's actions were pointless as the crew would have been unable to appropriately determine the condition of the nose-wheel of the Aerostar from a helicopter. And the Aerostar should have made an emergency landing attempt at Northeast Airport. The accident caused a change in procedure at many airports as helicopters were not to be used to determine landing gear failure. Aircraft should just fly a low pass or buzz the airport for visual confirmation from services on the ground. Aftermath U.S. Senator John Heinz Reactions News of Heinz's death at age 52 shocked fellow lawmakers. Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado, saying that he and his wife, Wren, considered Heinz and his wife, Teresa, \\"our dearest friends in the Senate,\\" paid tribute to his \\"intense intelligence, sparkling charm, and broad vision.\\" * Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas called Heinz \\"a dynamic and dedicated public servant, a tireless champion for Pennsylvania and a good and decent family man.\\" * Vice President Dan Quayle, in Los Angeles for a speech, said that \\"we are going to miss John Heinz tremendously. He made a tremendous contribution to the U.S. Senate.\\" Word of Heinz's death came from his Washington office. At midafternoon, sobbing members of his staff began walking out of his office in the Russell Senate Office Building. A few minutes later, the senator's legislative director, Richard Bryers, announced Heinz's death to reporters. Media attention The crash received multi-national attention making papers and news channels stories in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada, and Australia. No fly zone A U.S. Army operation out of Fort Dix, New Jersey, was caught filming a commercial with aircraft near Merion Elementary shortly after the accident. Complaints followed. An informal ban on flights in Lower Merion during school hours lasted for a while. Even the media agreed not to fly traffic or news helicopters above the school.

Daily public shows typically offer visitors a full-dome movie about a current topic in astronomy and planetary science. Interactive presentations provide a tour of the night sky over Montgomery, pointing out what planets, stars, and constellations can be seen overhead. The 159-seat theater uses a Super MediaGlobe II digital projection system (installed in 2014) to simulate the night sky. Other exhibits include a scale model of the Hubble Space Telescope, images of celestial objects, and a black lit hallway depicting the history of astronomy. The planetarium is currently closed on Saturdays.  References  Tourist attractions in Montgomery, Alabama Planetaria Troy University ","title":"W. A.

Created in 1918 as Secci√≥n Primera, under President Venustiano Carranza's administration, it reported directly to the office of the president. After the consolidation of the post-revolutionary Mexican political structure, and the rise of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (Spanish: Partido Revolucionario Institucional, PRI), its jurisdiction changed to that of the Mexican Secretariat of the Interior (Secretaria de Gobernaci√≥n). In 1985, following a political crisis involving the death DEA agent (Enrique Camarena Salazar), the DGIPS was combined with its sister agency, the Federal Security Directorate (Spanish: Direcci√≥n Federal de Seguridad, DFS), creating the Center for Research and National Security (Centro de Investigaci√≥n y Seguridad Nacional, CISEN) which is active to this day. Created during the years of the Mexican Revolution, its function, structure and scope of research changed over the years. Alongside the DFS, during the period from 1968 to the late 1970s, the DGIPS was accused of illegal detentions, torture, assassinations and forced disappearances. At least 347 complaints were received by the United Nations related to Mexican State crimes from 1960 to 1980.  Background  Intelligence services have always existed in Mexican history. During the pre-Columbian times, the Mexicas (aztecs) used \\"pochtecas\\" as political informants of the neighboring nations. These individuals would pretend to be merchants or merchant assistants, and travel to different areas to try and gather information on the number of warriors, changes in leadership or weather conditions. By the colonial times, the viceroyalty used the Inquisition and its network of informants as an informal form of rudimentary intelligence gathering service. Political and family alliances during the early years of the new Mexican nation were used as spies around the country. During the thirty year government of Porfirio D√≠az (known as Porfiriato), infiltration into dissident political movements was common placed and it worked as a reliable intelligence service. The intelligence service active during the Porfiriato was disrupted by the eruption of new social and political conditions, derived from the ongoing revolutionary war. By 1914, most of the old government structure had been eliminated and replaced by a new, \\"revolutionary\\" equivalent, including the intelligence agencies.  History   Mexican Revolution  After the defeat and exile of the ousted Mexican President, Victoriano Huerta, the different factions that fought in the Mexican Revolution gather in 1914 at what was called the Convention of Aguascalientes, in an attempt of creating a uniform political movement to govern the country. Yet, due to ideological differences, the Carranza delegation never arrived nor sent a representative, leaving the Zapata and Pancho Villa delegations in charge. Carranza refused to acknowledge the decisions taken at the Convention and faction wars broke up again. In 1916 he called for a Constituent Congress, which drafts the 1917 Mexican Constitution. Since the faction war was still active, Carranza created the Secci√≥n Primera as an intelligence agency in charge of investigating both the political enemies as well as allies. The agency started with twenty agents, all of them with a background in the police. By 1929, after a series of rebellions, changes in political alliances and assassinations of mayor figures (the last one being the one of President elect Alvaro Obreg√≥n), the Secci√≥n Primera was reformed into the Departamento Confidencial. Its main focus of research changed from closed allies and enemies, to that of the whole political structure which included deputies, senators, governors and possible candidates. This coincides with the creation of the National Revolutionary Party (the predecessor of the current PRI) and the unification of the different political factions into one national program.  World War II  Following the political restructuration, economic reforms and industries nationalization that occurred during the Lazaro Cardenas‚Äô administration, the DC was reformed again into the Oficina de Informaci√≥n Pol√≠tica. The focus of the intelligence services switch from threats from within the government to external rebellions, which came from conservative and religious factions, the first one from the urban areas and the latter from the rural areas of the county. As the European conflict escalated, the agency was reformed one more time, into the Departamento de Investigaci√≥n Pol√≠tica y Social. The DIPS was formed during the context of World War II, as an attempt to protect the national interest from those of the different international factions. The process of professionalization, which started in 1918, started to consolidate, with the security agency becoming more secretive and precise. The practice of infiltration within social and political movements started to grow as a standard practice. It's also a period of politicization within the DIPS, becoming more of a political tool for the PRI government than a police agency.  Cold War & Dirty War  During the times of the DIPS, the relationships between the Mexican and American intelligence agencies started working closely, with the U.S. \\"Hemispherical Defense‚Äù strategy being the guideline of the national security policy. This was a legacy of WWII and of the post-war escalation into the Cold War. After the triumph of the Cuban Revolution, and a growing regional tension in Latin-American, this strategy was change to that of defense against ‚Äúinternal subversion‚Äù. The threat no longer was the USSR invading the continent, but local dissidents overthrowing their respective governments and creating socialist countries. This change in strategy was visible in the shift of focus of the intelligence services in M√©xico, moving from external and conservative threats to left-wing politics, independent unions, peasant collectives and students movements.  The Camarena Incident and the reformation of the intelligence agencies  By the early eighties, the Mexican intelligence service, as well as the security services in general, had suffered a mayor backlash, product of the social mobilizations that demanded the appearance of disappeared people, as well as the liberation of political prisoners. By that time, the political and social environment had changed, and calls for reform were being heard. Still, the security and intelligence services hadn't adapted to the new times. During this time, since the counter guerilla activity had been on a considerable decline, most of the DGIPS and DFS agents got involved in the drug trafficking business. In 1984, acting on information from Camarena, 450 Mexican soldiers backed by helicopters destroyed a 2,500 acres marijuana plantation with an estimated annual production of $8 billion known as \\"Rancho B√∫falo\\". Camarena, who had been identified as the source of the leak, was abducted in broad daylight on February 7, 1985, by police officers working for drug lord Miguel √Ångel F√©lix Gallardo. Camarena was tortured at Gallardo's ranch over a 30-hour period, then murdered. His body was found in a rural area outside the small town of La Angostura, in the state of Michoac√°n, on March 5, 1985. Camarena's torture and murder triggered a rapid reaction from the DEA and launched the 'Operation Legend', the DEA's largest investigation. A special unit was sent to coordinate the investigation in Mexico. Investigators soon identified Miguel √Ångel F√©lix Gallardo and his two closest collaborators: Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo and Rafael Caro Quintero, as the main suspects in the kidnapping. Under enormous pressure from the United States on the government of Mexico's President Miguel de la Madrid (1982-1988), Fonseca and Quintero were quickly arrested. As a direct result of the Camarena Incident, the Mexican government was forced to admit the inefficiency of their intelligence service since both the DGIPS and the DFS, as well as police officers and military agents, were involved in the kidnapping. In order to avoid a bigger escalation of the crisis, both the DGIPS and the DFS were officially dissolved in 1985 and its remnants combined into one organization, the General Directorate of Investigation and National Security (Direcci√≥n General de Investigaci√≥n y Seguridad Nacional, DGISN), which was renamed Center of Investigation and National Security (Centro de Investigaci√≥n y Seguridad Nacional, CISEN) in 1989. By that time, most of what was considered as a ‚Äúbad element‚Äù in the previous agencies had been purged and the main focus of the new organization was rooted in the new political and social environment: rule of law. Most of the previous elements of the DGIPS and DFS, haven been trained in counterinsurgency strategies and intelligence gathering, defected and started working with the drug cartels.  DIPS & DGIPS Directors  As part of the consolidation process of the Mexican Revolution, little political power was given to the military personal. This was done in order to avoid generals or captains with a strong influence on the government structure, which might lead to the destabilization of political system. As so, the directors and top members of the DGIPS were mostly from a civilian background, with the exception of Capt. Alfonso Castro de la Mora. This was in sharp contrast with the DFS, whose directors mostly came from the military sector. * Alfonso Garc√≠a Gonz√°lez (1942) * Jos√© Lelo de Larrea (1943) * Capt.

Her childhood was overshadowed by an accident when she fell off her horse at a wedding party, which caused her to be confined her to her bed for significant periods of time. Her physician, Dr. Johann Heinrich Hegner, however, noticed her aptitude for mathematics and began to teach her. Henceforth, she studied mathematics using the books of Leonhard Euler, Gabriel Cramer, Pieter van Musschenbroek and J√©r√¥me Lalande. Reinhart corresponded with several mathematicians of the period, such as Christoph Jezler, and also received them as guests. She was active as a teacher of mathematics and was the instructor of Ulrich Hegner and Heinrich Bosshard von R√ºmikon among others. It is said that she edited the works of several of her contemporaries and wrote a manuscript commenting on the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica by Isaac Newton, however her comments were lost after her death, but her letters to Christoph Jezler were preserved. Several contemporaries commended Reinhart in their work, such as Daniel Bernoulli who praised her for expanding and improving the pursuit curve as discussed by Pierre Louis Maupertuis. Reinhart died in 1796 at the age of 66 from gout and the consequences of her childhood accident, from which never fully recovered.

It was discovered on 8 March 2000, by astronomers of the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research at the Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico. The body has a notably low albedo, and its shape resembles that of a \\"clenched fist\\".  Orbit and classification  orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.8‚Äì1.1 AU once every 11 months (336 days; semi-major axis of 0.95 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and an inclination of 22¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. A first precovery was found in the Digitized Sky Survey from images taken at ESO's La Silla Observatory in February 1977. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Socorro in March 2000.  Close approaches  The asteroid has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of which translates into 12.3 lunar distances. In February 2012, it was observed by radar during a close approach (0.045 AU) at the Arecibo and Goldstone observatories. The observations allowed to model the body's spin period and rotation, as well as its shape (see below).  Physical characteristics  has been characterized as a Xk-subtype, which transitions between the X- and K-type asteroids.  Rotation period, pole, and shape  During its close approach in February 2012, a rotational lightcurve of was obtained from photometric observations by a collaboration of astronomers from Uruguay, Australia, and the United States. Analysis of the lightcurve gave a period of 8.947 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.60 magnitude (). Radar observations at Arecibo and Goldstone showed that the asteroid spins in a retrograde manner with a rotation period of 8.96 hours. It is likely a principal axis rotator, i.e., not tumbling. Shape modelling by two independent teams gave sidereal periods of 8.96 and 8.944 hours, respectively. A spin axis of (80.0¬∞, ‚àí50.0¬∞) in ecliptic coordinates was determined. The observations also revealed that the asteroid has an elongated oblate shape, resembling a \\"clenched fist\\". Its surface exhibits multiple kilometer scale ridges and concavities.  Diameter and albedo  According to shape modeling of radar observations, the asteroid's overall dimensions are 2.6 √ó 2.2 √ó 2.1 kilometers. Based on an absolute magnitude of 18.2, this results in a notably low albedo of 0.018. More recent modeling combining radar, photometric, and infrared data gave and even more elongated shape of 2.9 √ó 2.2 √ó 1.5 kilometers. These authors argue that the absolute magnitude value is incorrect and report a geometric albedo of 0.09. 's mean-diameter measures between 2.0 and 2.26 kilometers and its surface has an albedo between 0.018 and 0.09. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts an albedo of 0.018 and a diameter of 2.26 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 18.2.

It is an evolution of the relational database for highly interconnected data as it provides a concept-level schema that fully implements the Entity-Relationship (ER) model. However, Grakn‚Äôs schema is a type system that implements the principles of knowledge representation and reasoning. This enables Grakn's declarative query language, Graql (Grakn‚Äôs reasoning and analytics query language), to provide a more expressive modelling language and the ability to perform deductive reasoning over large amounts of complex data. Effectively, Grakn is a knowledge base for artificial intelligence and cognitive computing systems. Grakn is developed by Grakn Labs Ltd. and is published under the GNU Affero General Public License. Main features ;Concept-level schema Grakn provides an enhanced entity- relationship schema to model complex datasets. The schema allows users to model type hierarchies, along with hyper-entities and hyper-relationships that can be extended anytime in the database lifecycle. Hyper-entities are defined to be entities with multiple instances for a given attribute, and hyper- relationships are defined to be N-ary relationships, nested relationships, cardinality-restricted relationships, or between relations and entities. This enables the creation of complex knowledge models that can evolve flexibly. ;Real-time inference Grakn‚Äôs query language performs deductive reasoning of entity types and relationships, to perform real-time inference of implicit facts and associations during runtime of OLTP queries. The inference is performed through entity and relationships type inference, as well as rule- based inference. This allows the discovery of facts that would otherwise be too hard to find. ;Distributed analytics Grakn‚Äôs query language performs distributed Pregel and MapReduce (BSP) algorithms abstracted as OLAP queries. These types of queries usually require custom development of distributed algorithms for every use case. However, Grakn creates an abstraction of these distributed algorithms and incorporates them as part of the language API. This enables large scale computation of BSP algorithms through a declarative language without the need for implementation. ;High-level query language With the expressivity of the schema, inference through OLTP and distributed algorithms through OLAP, Grakn provides strong abstraction over low-level data constructs and complicated relationships through its query language. The language provides a higher-level Schema, OLTP, and OLAP query language. Architecture Grakn is composed of two parts: Grakn the storage, and Graql the language. Grakn Grakn is a distributed knowledge graph for knowledge oriented system, i.e. a knowledge base. Under the hood, Grakn has built an expressive knowledge representation system with a transactional query interface. Grakn‚Äôs knowledge representation system is based on hypergraph theory, a subfield in mathematics that generalises an edge to be a set of vertices. The hypergraph data structure itself is represented in the form of key-value pairs and persisted on a distributed NoSQL database, Apache Cassandra. Thus, Grakn is a distributed system design to be shared and replicated over a network of computers. Graql Graql is Grakn‚Äôs declarative reasoning (through OLTP) and analytics (through OLAP) query language that creates a higher level abstraction over complex relationships. Graql allows users to derive implicit information that is hidden in a dataset, as well as reduce the complexity of that information. Graql is also capable of performing distributed analytics as part of the language, which allows it to perform analytics over large out of the box. These types of analytics are usually not possible without developing custom distributed graph algorithms that are unique to every use case. One may consider Graql as an OLKP (OnLine Knowledge Processing) language, which combines both OLTP (OnLine Transaction Processing) and OLAP (OnLine Analytical Processing).

Naval career Fleet was born in 1850, the third son of John George Fleet, of Gunnersbury. His elder brother Ferdinand F. Fleet was an Anglican priest. He joined the Royal Navy in 1864, and was midshipman when he was in July 1869 posted to the ironclad HMS Monarch, for her first commission in the Channel Fleet. Later the same year he was transferred to the armoured frigate , serving on the same station. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1874, and commanded the gunboat HMS Express and the armoured cruiser HMS Northampton, before he was promoted to commander in June 1887. Promotion to captain followed on 1 January 1895. From 1 January 1897 until 1899 he was captain of the breastwork monitor HMS Magdala, stationed in Bombay Harbour. In January 1900 he commissioned the ironclad battleship HMS Howe, port guardship at Queenstown, and on 12 October 1901 he transferred with his crew to the pre-dreadnought battleship , which took up the same position at Queenstown, and was flagship to Rear-Admiral Edmund Jeffreys, senior officer, Coast of Ireland Station. Following the Coronation Fleet Review for King Edward VII in August 1902, Captain Fleet was on 16 September appointed in command of the protected cruiser HMS Aeolus. Less than a year later, he was in May 1903 appointed captain-in-command of the Western Coast Guard District, a new command, and served as such until he retired on account of age in May 1905. He was promoted to flag rank as rear- admiral, and received the rank of vice-admiral on the retired list. Family Fleet married, at St. George's Church in Taunton on 24 October 1887, Alice Mary Elliot, second daughter of W. Franck Elliot, of Osborne House, Taunton.

She co-directed the first child guidance clinic, and her research shaped psychological theories about the causes behind child delinquency, emphasizing the need to focus on social and environmental factors over inherited traits.  Early life  Bronner was born July 22, 1881, in Louisville, Kentucky, to Gustave Bronner and Hanna Fox Bronner. The family was Jewish, and Augusta Fox Bronner's grandparents on both sides of the family were originally from Germany. She had two siblings, an older brother and a younger sister. After living in Cincinnati for several years, Bronner's family returned to Louisville, where Bronner graduated with her high school diploma in 1898.  Education  Bronner's mother and grandmother both encouraged her to study and build a career. Bronner had aspired to be a teacher since youth, and after high school she pursued an educator's certification at the Louisville Normal School. She dropped out briefly, due to eye problems, and spent a year travelling in Europe with her aunt before returning to the Normal School and graduating in 1901. After enrolling in the Columbia University Teachers College, Bronner completed her bachelor's degree (B.S.) in 1906, soon followed by her master's degree (A.M.) in 1909. During her studies, she worked part-time grading papers for psychologist Edward L. Thorndike. She returned to Louisville briefly, teaching at the local Louisville Girls' High School ‚Äì her old school ‚Äì until her father's death in 1911. Bonner then began her doctoral studies at the Teachers' College, working with Thorndike. In 1914, Bronner completed her doctoral degree and published her dissertation, entitled A Comparative Study of the Intelligence of Delinquent Girls. Bronner's research showed that there was no correlation between delinquency and mental disability, undermining the common notion of the time that criminal behaviour was passed down through biological factors.  Career  In 1913, while taking a summer course at Harvard University, Bronner met Chicago neurologist and professor William Healy. Healy was equally interested in the study of child delinquency, and subsequently hired Bronner to work as a psychologist at his Chicago Juvenile Psychopathic Institute. In 1914, the institute was renamed the Psychopathic Clinic of the Juvenile Court, and Bronner soon became the assistant director. Bronner and Healy proceeded to shape the study and treatment of delinquent youth, contributing to the scientific understanding that most juvenile crime stemmed from \\"mental repressions, social conflicts, and family relations\\", not hereditary factors. Among other research, Bronner identified that delinquency often arose as a result of placing children with learning disabilities or special abilities in the wrong kinds of educational environments. In 1917, Bronner and Healy took up new positions at the Judge Baker Foundation of Boston (later the Judge Baker Children's Center), a new publicly funded child guidance clinic attached to the Boston juvenile court. Bronner handled most of the psychological examinations of youth, as well as interviews with girls and the youngest children. In 1927, Bronner and Healy wrote the influential Manual of Individual Mental Tests and Testing, a comprehensive guide to assessing a patient's mental state. Although Healy was originally given the full position of director, with Bronner acting as assistant director, Bronner eventually became co-director of the Foundation in 1930. The Judge Baker Foundation soon became a model for other child guidance clinics across the country, with its co-directors developing important psychiatric practices such as the \\"team\\" method, in which psychologists worked together with social workers and physicians to treat a patient. On November 19, 1930, Bronner and Healy were invited by President Herbert Hoover to attend the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection. During the 1930s, Bronner also worked briefly in New Haven, Connecticut, as Director of the short-lived Research Institute of Human Relations at Yale University. She was president of the American Orthopsychiatric Association in 1932.  Publications  After her dissertation, Bronner published The psychology of special abilities and disabilities in 1917. It was reprinted multiple times, helping to boost the vocational testing movement. Her 1916 article \\"Attitude as It Affects Performances of Tests\\" was well-cited by others in subsequent research, exploring how certain factors could affect test results. As her personal and professional relationship with William Healy grew, Bronner retreated from publishing her individual work, preferring to co-write with Healy. In collaboration with Healy, Bronner published multiple books on juvenile psychology, including Reconstructing behavior in youth: A study of problem children in foster families (1929), Treatment and what happened afterward (1939), and What makes a child delinquent? (1948).  Personal life and retirement  In September 1932, after Healy's wife died, he and Bronner finally married. According to biographer John C. Burnham, marriage changed very little about their professional relationship, its only effects being the easier facilitation of their working together on evenings and weekends and \\"complicating administration of the clinic\\" whenever the couple went on vacation together. A shortage of staff during World War II prolonged Bronner and Healy's work at the Judge Baker Foundation, despite retirement plans. After the couple finally retired in 1946, Bronner destroyed most of her own personal research and unpublished papers, preferring to keep the public's focus on her husband's academic work. Bronner and Healy spent their retirement in Clearwater, Florida.  Death  Bronner died in Clearwater on December 11, 1966.

This response under climate change is a positive climate feedback. There is approximately two to three times more carbon in global soils than the Earth's atmosphere, which makes understanding this feedback crucial to understand future climate change. An increased rate of soil respiration is the main cause of this feedback, where measurements imply that 4 ¬∞C of warming increases annual soil respiration by up to 37%. Soil Carbon Feedback to Climate Change An observation based study on future climate change, on the soil carbon feedback, conducted since 1991 in Harvard, suggests release of about 190 petagrams of soil carbon, the equivalent of the past two decades of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning, until 2100 from the top 1-meter of Earth's soils, due to changes in microbial communities under elevated temperatures. A 2018 study concludes, \\"Climate-driven losses of soil carbon are currently occurring across many ecosystems, with a detectable and sustained trend emerging at the global scale.\\" Permafrost Thawing of permafrost (frozen ground), which is located in higher latitudes, the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, suggest based on observational evidence a linear and chronic release of greenhouse gas emissions with ongoing climate change from these carbon dynamics. Tipping Point A study published in 2011 identified a so-called compost-bomb instability, related to a tipping point with explosive soil carbon releases from peatlands. The authors noted that there is a unique stable soil carbon equilibrium for any fixed atmospheric temperature. Uncertainties Climate models do not account for effects of biochemical heat release associated with microbial decomposition.

Bell‚Äôs mother, Beth Hamilton Bell, was a model and writer who ran a radio program in the United States. Hoping to meet Don Eagle, she arranged an interview with him; six weeks later, the pair eloped. Beth Hamilton Bell moved to the Kahnawake Mohawk Reserve to be with Eagle during an era when inter- racial marriage was illegal. After the birth of Bell and his brother, the marriage dissolved and Hamilton Bell took John Kim and his brother to the United States where they lived with Hamilton Bell‚Äôs parents in Columbus, Ohio. Bell and his brother returned to the Kahnawake Reserve in the summers of their youth but faced equal alienation there as they did in Columbus. Bell began playing the piano at age eight and later studied violin and saxophone. Talented from an early age, he was playing the piano on local television talent shows at age ten and winning state piano competitions. As a teen he was hired by John Kenley to play piano for the Kenley Players summer theatre company which led to his appointment as associate conductor of the international company A Chorus Line. By the age of 18 Bell was conducting numerous Broadway, ballet and operatic productions, which included headliners Gene Kelly and Lauren Bacall.  Education and early career  Bell attended Ohio State University from which he received a Bachelor of Music in 1976. He went on to attend the Academia Musica Chigiana in Sienna, Italy and later apprenticed with Zubin Mehta at the New York Philharmonic. After studying in Italy, Bell went to New York and conducted for the Harlem Dance Theatre, Eglevsky Ballet, and many Broadway shows and operatic productions.  Career   Composer and conductor  In 1980, Bell was touring in Toronto, Ontario, Canada with the international company of A Chorus Line. The pit musicians, predominantly from the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, were so taken with Bell that they suggested to then-Music Director of the TSO Andrew Davis to take Bell on as an apprentice. Shortly after auditioning for Davis, Bell was appointed Apprentice Conductor of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. In 1984, the CBC created a documentary on Bell‚Äôs musical career titled \\"John Kim Bell: The First North American Indian Conductor.\\" The release of this documentary caused innumerable Indigenous artists to contact him for support in achieving success. Bell also began to receive speaking invitations from Indigenous communities and political groups as well as solicitations for charitable donations. Having researched and not found any existing Indigenous arts programs, Bell was inspired to establish the Canadian Native Arts Foundation (CNAF) to educate and promote Indigenous artists. His first concert fundraiser took place in 1987 and included the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Don Ross, the then-unknown Shania Twain, and Bernadette Peters. John Kim Bell produced, directed, co-composed, and conducted In the Land of the Spirits, the first all-Indigenous ballet to tour nationally. The ballet premiered at the National Arts Centre in 1992 and enjoyed an immensely successful run. Bell composed music for Divided Loyalties, the Trial of Standing Bear, No Turning Back, and Time Immemorial as well as for many of the National Aboriginal Achievement Awards shows that he executive produced and directed. In 1985 he conducted the orchestra of the National Ballet of Canada and in 1987, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London.  Philanthropist  As an Indigenous man living in the bourgeois world of symphony music, Bell experienced a sort of identity crisis. He recognized that as a powerful Indigenous role model, he could contribute to - and inspire- substantial social change for his peoples. In 1985, Bell founded the National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation. In 1993, to mark the United Nations‚Äô International Decade of the World‚Äôs Indigenous People, Bell mounted the National Aboriginal Achievement Awards, celebrating the success of Indigenous leaders in Canada. Under Bell's leadership the National Aboriginal Achievement Awards were once the largest cultural event in Canada. Bell served as the President for the NAAF for twenty years, aiding it to become the largest charity for Indigenous peoples. He has been credited with accruing the greatest amount of corporate support for an Indigenous cause within Canada. Over two decades, Bell raised approximately $80 million for the NAAA and NAAF. The NAAF is now known as Indspire, while the NAAA has been renamed to the Indspire Awards. In 2008, Bell proposed the idea of a $250 million First Nations Loan Guarantee Program in Ontario, which the provincial government implemented in 2010. Bell is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.http://artistsagainstracism.org/artists/  Consultancy  From 1988 to 2005 Bell was president of management company Ariontha Inc. In 2006 he founded Bell & Bernard Limited. In 2009 he helped established the Enbridge School Plus Program, which supports extracurricular activities and enrichment programming in First Nations schools. Today, Mr. Bell is one of Canada's leading Indigenous energy resource consultants representing First Nations and the President & CEO of Bell & Bernard Limited.  Board appointments  Bell has been a member of several boards including at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation, and the Aboriginal Human Resource Development Council of Canada. He has also sat on the boards of the Canadian Institute for Health Research, the Federal Task Force on Professional Training in the Cultural Sector, and the City of Toronto's 2008 Olympic bid. Bell is currently a patron and Arts Jury Chair of Indigenous Arts & Stories, formerly the Canadian Aboriginal Writing and Arts Challenge, a writing and visual arts competition for Indigenous youth.

Productions The play was originally set to premiere in 2002 at Signature Theatre Company in New York City in a production starring Anne Bancroft. Bancroft fell ill with pneumonia, causing the production to be cancelled. The play premiered at the Peter Norton Space of Signature Theatre Company in 2008 in a production starring Mercedes Ruehl and directed by Pam MacKinnon. Synopsis The entire play consists of a hypothetical interview of 20th century sculptor Louise Nevelson that takes place years after her death in 1988. The interviewer is an unnamed man that may possibly be a stand-in for the playwright or Maria Nevelson, Founder of the Louise Nevelson Foundation. The first half of the play deals with Nevelson's childhood in a family of Russian Jewish immigrants in Rockland, Maine as well as her failed marriage to Charles Nevelson. The second half chronicles her life as an artist, rise to fame, and her eventual death. Throughout the play, the interviewer takes on an active role, often questioning Nevelson's version of reality and prying into details of her personal life. The play ends with Nevelson \\"occupying\\" her place as a preeminent American sculptor. Themes The play repeatedly deals with themes of reality versus illusion, and the reliability of memory. The play also explores feminist and Jewish identity, highlighting the challenges Nevelson faced as a Jewish woman in the art world. Critical reception Ben Brantley writing in The New York Times described the play as having \\"a conversational flow that quickly carries you past fears of being trapped in a lecture hall.\\" The review also praised Ruehl's performance as having a \\"seductive humility.\\" References Plays by Edward Albee 2001 plays ","title":"Occupant (play)"},{"id":"55488703","text":"When the Smoke Clears is an EP by the American hardcore punk band Sick of It All.

Early life Aldcroft was born in Manchester in 1835. His father owned an omnibus company. Career Aldcroft was apprenticed to Middleham trainer Tom Dawson, and got his big riding opportunity when Thomas Lye, the stable jockey, left his role in contentious circumstances. Aldcroft succeeded Lye, and quickly won a series of Classics for Dawson. An early notable win came in the 1853 Chester Cup, but he rode his \\"greatest and finest race\\" early in his career for Dawson, when winning the 1855 2,000 Guineas on Lord of the Isles, aged 20. The horse went on to finish third in the Derby. The following year, Aldcroft won the Derby for Dawson on Ellington at odds of 20/1, in heavy ground which produced the slowest time ever recorded for a Derby winner: 3 minutes, 5 seconds. The win, however, was marred by a rumour that Aldcroft had weighed out for his ride with a whip weighing seven pounds which he then switched for a virtually weightless one, thereby giving him a seven-pound advantage. Afterwards, he had switched back to the heavier whip to weigh back in. He would later ride Ellington's sister, Gildermire, into second honours in the 1858 Oaks. In the same year, he finished third in the Derby and second in the St Leger on The Hadji. The following year, he registered his next Classic win, the 1859 St Leger, for trainer John Scott on Gamester, owned by Sir Charles Monck. For Scott, he also won the 1860 1,000 Guineas on Sagitta, and the 1863 Oaks, a race he \\"pulled out of the fire\\" on Queen Bertha. Aldcroft was the first choice jockey of owner Lord Glasgow, and in 1864, Aldcroft won the 2,000 Guineas for Glasgow on General Peel. General Peel shortened in price from 20/1 to 7/2 in the final two weeks before the race, having been heavily backed. \\"The General\\" was then beaten to the 1864 Derby by Blair Atholl. Lord Glasgow took issue with this defeat and as a result, Aldcroft lost the ride, with John Wells taking the mount in the St Leger. Aldcroft and Glasgow had a strange relationship and frequently argued in a manner likened to \\"lovers' quarrels\\". Both were known to weep during arguments, and mutual friends were unable to rectify the situation. In one such incident, Glasgow accused Aldcroft of being in the pay of bookmaker John Jackson, without justification, and Aldcroft quit racing and retired to his home in Newmarket. Lord Glasgow later acknowledged his error and, as a goodwill gesture, left Aldcroft ¬£500 in his will when he died in 1869. He was invited back into racing by trainer Joseph Lawson, who trained at Bedford Lodge in Newmarket, with a ride on the well-regarded horse Miss Foote, but Aldcroft no longer had the confidence and was unable to mount a horse. According to one obituary, his final race had been on the Duke of Hamilton's filly Leonie in the Oaks of 1868. Besides his Classic victories, Aldcroft had won the Goodwood Cup, Queen's Vase, Northumberland Plate and Cesarewitch Handicap amongst other big races. Riding style Aldcroft was said to have fine hands and wonderful patience. His well-timed finish was compared to greats including Frank Butler, Jim Robinson, and Sam Chifney Jr.. He was not so tall, and rode at 5st 7lb during his apprenticeship, but weight was a problem, with some attributing his departure from racing to increasing weight, rather than a dispute with Lord Glasgow. Personal life In his prime, Aldcroft was a \\"handsome jockey\\" with \\"finely chiselled features\\" and black, bushy side-whiskers. He was considered a bit of a dandy. He married Jane Cartwright, daughter of the jockey who rode Beeswing, and lived with her in Newmarket at Grafton House on the High Street. However, he was also a habitual smoker and years of heavy smoking took their effect on him. After a protracted illness, he died, aged 48, on 4 May 1883. He was buried in Newmarket Cemetery and his funeral was attended by contemporaries including James Goater and John Osborne Jr, as well as the new generation of jockeys including Fred Archer, and trainers including Mathew Dawson. His wife Jane was buried alongside him when she died on 31 August 1921, aged 77.

Martin was the third son of John Martin MP banker, of Overbury and Lombard Street and his wife Catherine Jackson, daughter of Joseph Jackson of Sneyd Park, Gloucestershire. He was born on 4 June 1738 and was educated by Rev. Matthew Bloxam, vicar of Overbury and Rev. James Graham, of Hackney. On leaving school he entered the family banking house. He married Penelope Skipp, daughter of Joseph Skipp of Upper Hall, Ledbury, Herefordshire on 17 February 1774. Martin was elected Member of Parliament for Tewkesbury in a by-election on 8 April 1776 following the death of his brother Joseph. He acquired a reputation for his scrupulously independent attitude. Wraxall described him as 'one of the most conscientious and honest men who ever sat in Parliament'. His strong religious views‚Äîtending to unitarianism and firmly anti-clerical‚Äîled him to press for a number of humanitarian reforms: he spoke often against the slave trade and the press gang, and for some mitigation in the penal code. On political questions he took a radical line, advocating economical and parliamentary reform. A diffident and portentous speaker, his frequent protestations of independence bored the House, and he was not always well heard. He expounded his creed: Whoever may be in power will be unsolicited by me for place or emoluments ... I should as soon think of lurking in the avenues of the House as a petty pilferer, as I would barter the interests of the public or my constituents for anything a minister could grant me, or for any private advantage or emolument whatever. Ambition, Sir, as the word is generally understood, is entirely out of my line of life; but, Sir, I own I have an ambition, and of which I am not ashamed; it is to be an honest, independent, useful Member of Parliament. After this he intervened frequently in debate, though he admitted later that he 'never rose to speak in the House without great awe and embarrassment'. Martin was returned unopposed for Tewkesbury in the 1780 general election. He acquired the nickname Starling Martin after condemning Fox's India bill on 1 December 1783 as 'pernicious and unconstitutional', and wished there were a starling to perch on the Speaker's chair and repeat incessantly 'disgraceful, shameless Coalition'. Lord North responded a few days later :‚ÄúIt had been said on a former day that a starling ought to be brought, placed in this House, and taught to speak the words 'Coalition! Coalition! cursed Coalition'. Now, for my part, I think that while there is in this House an honourable gentleman who never fails, let what will be the subject of debate, to take an opportunity to curse the Coalition, I think there will be no occasion for the starling; and while he continues to speak by rote, and without any fixed idea, I think what he says will make just as much impression as if the starling himself was to utter his words.‚Äù It was said that here the House could scarcely give the noble lord an opportunity to proceed, they fell into so violent a fit of laughter. The immoderate response to a pleasant witticism suggests that Martin was already regarded as a ludicrous figure: indeed, a few weeks later, he referred to himself wryly as the deputy-starling. His extreme portliness made him conspicuous, and his behaviour was often eccentric. Though there was a contest at Tewkesbury at the 1784 general election, Martin's seat was not in danger. He returned to Westminster to pursue his old vendettas against Lord North and the encroachments of the peers. By 1790, Martin was head of the family bank in London and continued to sit for Tewkesbury on their interest. He was returned unopposed in 1790 but there was a contest in 1796. He was returned unopposed in 1802. He was considering retiring before the next election, but in 1806 he stood again and was returned unopposed. He was granted three weeks' leave because of ill health on 10 March 1807. He retired at the subsequent dissolution to make way for his eldest son John who was beaten at the polls in the 1807,. Shortly afterwards Martin retired from the bank. On 1 February 1808, now 'old and infirm', he agreed to sign Wyvill's petition for religious toleration, being to the last 'a most hearty advocate for civil and religious liberty to its utmost extent'. He died on 26 January 1810.

The lack of precise borders accompanied with diverse theoretical approaches related to what interpretative journalism is in the modern world results in the practice of interpretative journalism overlapping with various other genres of journalism, and furthermore operationalization of interpretative journalism becomes largely blurred. Interpretive journalists must have atypical awareness with and comprehension of a subject with their work involving looking for systems, rationale and influences that explain what they are reporting. The impact of interpretive journalism is when the reporting results in trend-setting articles, powerful think-pieces and further straying into the field of investigative reporting which has become the hallmark of good print journalism.

The scholarly consensus is that there was no Exodus as described in the Bible. Modern archaeologists believe that the Israelites were indigenous to Canaan and were never in ancient Egypt, and if there is any historical basis to the Exodus it can apply only to a small segment of the population of Israelites at large. Nevertheless, there is also a general understanding that something must lie behind the traditions, even if Moses and the Exodus narrative belong to collective cultural memory rather to history. According to Avraham Faust \\"most scholars agree that the narrative has a historical core, and that some of the highland settlers came, one way or another, from Egypt.\\" Egyptologist Jan Assmann suggests that the Exodus narrative combines, among other things, the expulsion of the Hyksos, the religious revolution of Akhenaten, the experiences of the Habiru (gangs of antisocial elements found throughout the ancient Near East), and the large-scale migrations of the Sea Peoples into \\"a coherent story that is fictional as to its composition but historical as to some of its components.\\" The Exodus and history The consensus of modern scholars is that the Bible does not give an accurate account of the origins of the Israelites. There is no indication that the Israelites ever lived in Ancient Egypt, and the Sinai Peninsula shows almost no sign of any occupation for the entire 2nd millennium BCE (even Kadesh-Barnea, where the Israelites are said to have spent 38 years, was uninhabited prior to the establishment of the Israelite monarchy). In contrast to the absence of evidence for the Egyptian captivity and wilderness wanderings, there are ample signs of Israel's evolution within Canaan from native Canaanite roots. While a few scholars discuss the historicity, or at least plausibility, of the exodus story, the majority of archaeologists have abandoned it, in the phrase used by archaeologist William Dever, as \\"a fruitless pursuit\\". The biblical narrative contains some details which are authentically Egyptian, but such details are scant, and the story frequently does not reflect Egypt of the Late Bronze Age or even Egypt at all (it is unlikely, for example, that a mother would place a baby in the reeds of the Nile, where it would be in danger from crocodiles). Such elements of the narrative as can be fitted into the 2nd millennium could equally belong to the 1st, consistent with a 1st millennium BCE writer trying to set an old story in Egypt. (The name of Moses, for example, belongs to 1st millennium Egyptian, and would have been Mase in the 2nd). As a result, while a few scholars continue to discuss the historicity, or at least plausibility, of an exodus as described in the Bible, most histories of Israel do not include the Egyptian captivity, the Exodus, or the wilderness wanderings in their discussion of Israel's origins. A century of research by archaeologists and Egyptologists has found no evidence which can be directly related to the Exodus captivity and the escape and travels through the wilderness. Archaeologists generally agree that the Israelites had Canaanite origins: the culture of the earliest Israelite settlements is Canaanite, their cult-objects are those of the Canaanite god El, the pottery remains are in the Canaanite tradition, and the alphabet used is early Canaanite. Almost the sole marker distinguishing the \\"Israelite\\" villages from Canaanite sites is an absence of pig bones, although whether even this is an ethnic marker or is due to other factors remains a matter of dispute. According to Exodus 12:37‚Äì38, the Israelites numbered \\"about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children\\", plus the Erev Rav (\\"mixed multitude\\") and their livestock. Numbers 1:46 gives a more precise total of 603,550 men aged 20 and up. It is difficult to reconcile the idea of 600,000 Israelite fighting men with the information that the Israelites were afraid of the Philistines and Egyptians. The 600,000, plus wives, children, the elderly, and the \\"mixed multitude\\" of non-Israelites would have numbered some 2 to 2.5 million. Marching ten abreast, and without accounting for livestock, they would have formed a column 240 km (144 miles) long. At the traditional time-setting for this putative event, Egypt's population has been estimated to be in the range of 3 to 4.5 million. and no evidence has been found that Egypt ever suffered the demographic and economic catastrophe such a loss of population would represent, nor that the Sinai desert ever hosted (or could have hosted) these millions of people and their herds. Some have rationalised the numbers into smaller figures, for example reading the Hebrew as \\"600 families\\" rather than 600,000 men, but all such solutions have their own set of problems. Details point to a 1st millennium date for the composition of the narrative: Ezion-Geber (one of the Stations of the Exodus), for example, dates to a period between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE with possible further occupation into the 4th century BCE, and those place-names on the Exodus route which have been identified ‚Äì Goshen, Pithom, Succoth, Ramesses and Kadesh Barnea ‚Äì point to the geography of the 1st millennium rather than the 2nd. Similarly, Pharaoh's fear that the Israelites might ally themselves with foreign invaders seems unlikely in the context of the late 2nd millennium, when Canaan was part of an Egyptian empire and Egypt faced no enemies in that direction, but does make sense in a 1st millennium context, when Egypt was considerably weaker and faced invasion first from the Achaemenid Empire and later from the Seleucid Empire. The mention of the dromedary in Exodus 9:3 also suggests a later date ‚Äì the widespread domestication of the camel as a herd animal is thought not to have taken place before the late 2nd millennium, after the Israelites had already emerged in Canaan, and they did not become widespread in Egypt until c. 200‚Äì100 BCE. The chronology of the Exodus narrative is symbolic: for example, its culminating event, the erection of the Tabernacle as Yahweh's dwelling-place among his people, occurs in the year 2666 Anno Mundi (Year of the World, meaning 2666 years after God creates the world), and two-thirds of the way through a four thousand year era which culminates in or around the re-dedication of the Second Temple in 164 BCE. As a result, attempts to date the event to a specific century in known history have been inconclusive. places it 480 years before the construction of Solomon's Temple, implying an Exodus at c. 1450 BCE, but the number is rhetorical rather than historical, representing a symbolic twelve generations of forty years each. In any case, Canaan at this time was part of the Egyptian empire, so that the Israelites would in effect be escaping from Egypt to Egypt, and its cities do not show destruction layers consistent with the Bible's account of the occupation of the land (Jericho was \\"small and poor, almost insignificant, and unfortified (and) [t]here was also no sign of a destruction\\" (Finkelstein and Silberman, 2002). William F. Albright, the leading biblical archaeologist of the mid-20th century, proposed a date of around 1250‚Äì1200 BCE, but his so-called \\"Israelite\\" markers (four- roomed houses, collar-rimmed jars, etc,) are continuations of Canaanite culture. The lack of evidence has led scholars to conclude that the Exodus story does not represent a specific historical moment. The Torah lists the places where the Israelites rested. A few of the names at the start of the itinerary, including Ra'amses, Pithom and Succoth, are reasonably well identified with archaeological sites on the eastern edge of the Nile Delta, as is Kadesh-Barnea, where the Israelites spend 38 years after turning back from Canaan; other than these, very little is certain. The crossing of the Red Sea has been variously placed at the Pelusic branch of the Nile, anywhere along the network of Bitter Lakes and smaller canals that formed a barrier toward eastward escape, the Gulf of Suez (south-southeast of Succoth), and the Gulf of Aqaba (south of Ezion-Geber), or even on a lagoon on the Mediterranean coast. The biblical Mount Sinai is identified in Christian tradition with Jebel Musa in the south of the Sinai Peninsula, but this association dates only from the 3rd century CE, and no evidence of the Exodus has been found there. The expulsion of the Hyksos Ahmose slaying a Hyksos (center) The Hyksos were a Semitic people whose arrival and departure from Ancient Egypt has sometimes been seen as broadly parallel to the biblical tale of the sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt. Canaanite populations first appeared in Egypt towards the end of the 12th Dynasty c. 1800 BCE, and either around that time, or c. 1720 BCE, established an independent realm in the eastern Nile Delta. In about 1650 BCE, this realm was assumed by the rulers known as the Hyksos, who formed the 15th Dynasty of Egyptian pharaohs. It has been claimed that new revolutionary methods of warfare ensured for the Hyksos their ascendancy, in their influx into the new emporia being established in Egypt's delta and at Thebes in support of the Red Sea trade. However, in recent years the idea of a simple Hyksos migration, with little or no war, has gained support. In any case, the 16th Dynasty and the 17th Dynasty continued to rule in Upper Egypt (southern Egypt) in co-existence with the Hyksos kings, perhaps as their vassals. Eventually, Seqenenre Tao, Kamose and Ahmose I waged war against the Hyksos and expelled Khamudi, their last king, from Egypt c. 1550 BCE. The saga of the Hyksos was recorded by the Egyptian historian Manetho (3rd century BCE), chief priest at the Temple of Ra in Heliopolis, and is preserved in three quotations by the 1st century CE Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus. In Manetho's History of Egypt, as retold by Josephus, Manetho describes the Hyksos, their lowly origins in Asia, their invasion and dominion over Egypt, their eventual expulsion, and their subsequent exile to Judea, and their establishing the city of Jerusalem and its temple. Manetho defined the Hyksos as being the Hyksos or \\"Shepherd Kings\\" or \\"Captive Shepherds\\" who invaded Egypt, destroying its cities and temples and making war with the Egyptian people to \\"gradually destroy them to the very roots\\". Following a war with the Egyptians a treaty was negotiated stipulating that these Hyksos Shepherds were to exit Egypt. Josephus said that Manetho's Hyksos narrative was a reliable Egyptian account about the Israelite Exodus, and that the Hyksos were 'our people'. Donald Redford said that the Exodus narrative is a Canaanite memory of the Hyksos' descent and occupation of Egypt. Jan Assmann said the biblical narrative is more like a counterhistory: \\"It turns kings into slaves; an expulsion into a ban on emigration; a descent from the Egyptian throne to insignificance into an ascent from oppression to freedom as god's chosen people.\\" There is a current scholarly consensus that if the Israelites did emerge from Egypt, it must have occurred sometime during the 13th century, because there is no archaeological evidence of any distinctive Israelite material culture before that time. Nevertheless, many recent scholars have posited that the Exodus narrative may have developed from collective memories of Hyksos expulsions from Egypt, and possibly elaborated on to encourage resistance to the 7th century domination of Judah by Egypt. Minoan eruption In her book The Parting of the Sea: How Volcanoes, Earthquakes, and Plagues Shaped the Story of the Exodus, geologist Barbara J. Sivertsen explores links between the biblical Exodus narrative, the Hyksos expulsion, and the Minoan (Thera) volcanic eruption. Apocalyptic rainstorms, which devastated much of Egypt, and were described on the Tempest Stele of Ahmose I, pharaoh of the Hyksos expulsion, have been attributed to short-term climatic changes caused by the Theran eruption. While it has been argued that the damage attributed to this storm may have been caused by an earthquake following the Thera Eruption, it has also been suggested that it was caused during a war with the Hyksos, and the storm reference is merely a metaphor for chaos upon which the Pharaoh was attempting to impose order. Documents such as Hatshepsut's Speos Artemidos depict storms, but are clearly figurative not literal. Research indicates that the Speos Artemidos stele is a reference to her overcoming the powers of chaos and darkness. Akhenaten and the end of the Amarna period Statue head of Akhenaten Akhenaten, also known as Amenhotep IV, was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty. This Pharaoh presided over radical changes in Egyptian religious practices. He established a form of solar monotheism or monolatry based on the cult of Aten, and disbanded the priesthoods of all other gods. His new capital, Akhetaten or 'Horizon of Aten', was built at the site known today as Amarna. The city was built hastily, mostly using mud bricks. After Akhenaten's death, it was abandoned. The temples, shrines, and royal statues were razed later, during the reign of Horemheb. The idea of Akhenaten as the pioneer of a monotheistic religion that later became Judaism has been considered by various scholars. One of the first to mention this was Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, in his book Moses and Monotheism. Basing his arguments on a belief that the Exodus story was historical, Freud argued that Moses had been an Atenist priest forced to leave Egypt with his followers after Akhenaten's death. Freud argued that Akhenaten was striving to promote monotheism, something that the biblical Moses was able to achieve. In 1973, William F. Albright noted that Moses and many of his family members had Egyptian names, and said that there is no good reason to deny that Moses was influenced by the monotheism of Akhenaten. However, Donald Redford said that there is little evidence that Akhenaten was a progenitor of Biblical monotheism. To the contrary, he said, the religion of the Hebrew Bible had its own separate development beginning 500 years later. Egyptian and Hellenistic parallels Several ancient non-biblical sources seem to parallel the biblical Exodus narrative or the events which occurred at the end of the eighteenth dynasty when the new religion of Akhenaten was denounced and his capital city of Amarna was abandoned. These tales often combine elements of the Hyksos expulsion. For example, Hecataeus of Abdera (c. 320 BCE) tells how the Egyptians blamed a plague on foreigners and expelled them from the country, whereupon Moses, their leader, took them to Canaan. There are more than a dozen versions of this story, all of them adding more detail, most of them profoundly anti-Jewish. Manetho tells how 80,000 lepers and other \\"impure people\\", led by a priest named Osarseph, join forces with the former Hyksos, now living in Jerusalem, to take over Egypt. They wreak havoc until eventually the pharaoh and his son chase them out to the borders of Syria, where Osarseph gives the lepers a law-code and changes his name to Moses, although the identification of Osarseph with Moses in the second account may be a later addition. Josephus vehemently disagreed with the claim that the Israelites were connected with Manetho's story about Osarseph and the lepers. The stories told by Hecataeus and Manetho seems to be related in some way to that of the Exodus, although it is impossible to tell whether they both bear witness to historical events, or Manetho is a polemical response to the Exodus story, or the Exodus story a response to the Egyptian stories. Three interpretations have been proposed for Manetho's story of Osarseph and the lepers: the first, as a memory of the Amarna period; the second, as a memory of the Hyksos; and the third, as an anti-Jewish propaganda. Each explanation has evidence to support it: the name of the pharaoh, Amenophis, and the religious character of the conflict fit the Amarna reform of Egyptian religion; the name of Avaris and possibly the name Osarseph fit the Hyksos period; and the overall plot is an apparent inversion of the Jewish story of the Exodus casting the Jews in a bad light. No one theory, however, can explain all the elements. A proposal by Egyptologist Jan Assmann suggests that the story has no single origin but rather combines numerous historical experiences, notably the Amarna and Hyksos periods, into a folk memory.

In the early 2000s, he served as senior vice president of Marketing and International Operations for US Airways during a troubling period when the company filed bankruptcy twice in as many years. Baldanza left US Airways to become president and COO of Spirit Airlines in January 2005. He became chief executive officer of Spirit in 2006. At the time, the company was recording yearly losses of $79 million. During his tenure, Baldanza was ‚Äúthe public face of Spirit‚Äôs transformation into a more extreme version of a discount airline.‚Äù He designed a plan to transform it into an ultra-low-cost carrier. The company implemented a ‚ÄúBare Fare‚Äù model, opting to charge airline fees for many services included in traditional airline fares. This included fees for the option to select a desired seat, food and drink, carry-on and checked baggages. On July 14, 2010, Baldanza testified in a U.S. Congress hearing in which he defended the airline's unpopular ‚Äúpolicy to unbundle services not essential to passenger transport.‚Äù He has faced significant criticism stemming from transformation of the airline into an ultra-low-cost carrier. Baldanza has been largely unapologetic about his company's new pricing policy. He was even been featured in a 2010 video in which he placed himself inside an overhead bin to defend the airlines new policy on carry-on fees by saying ‚ÄúHad we not implemented this, there‚Äôs no telling what people would try to put in an overhead bin‚Äù. The most reported criticism of Baldanza stemmed from his handling of customer complaints, especially his initial refusal to refund the fare of a terminally-ill military veteran in May 2012. The Vietnam veteran was diagnosed with cancer and was recently informed that it was terminal and that he was unfit to travel by plane. He requested for a refund and was refused. Baldanza initially defended his team's decision by stating that the customer purchased a nonrefundable fare with no insurance and therefore the company does not owe him a refund as that would be unfair to other customers. He faced criticism from veterans organizations including a social media campaign to boycott Spirit Airlines. Baldanza eventually apologized for failing to ‚Äúdemonstrate the respect or the compassion that [he] should have, given [the customer‚Äôs] medical condition and his service to [his] country.‚Äù He announced he would return the price of the fare from his own funds and that Spirit Airlines would make a donation to a veteran's group. During his tenure, the airline had become profitable in ‚Äúa period in which many airlines struggled to stay in business.‚Äù As of 2011, ‚ÄúSpirit earned 40% more per airplane than any other U.S. airline‚Äù. Baldanza and other executives at Spirit were paid less than others in the industry and but instead owned shares in the company. Baldanza often promoted terms such as ‚Äúa bus with wings‚Äù and ‚Äúdollar store of the sky‚Äù to describe the airline. He pushed for ways of offsetting costs by selling advertising spaces where ever available on the plane, including flight attendant aprons, seatback trays, overhead bins, napkins, cups and motion sickness bags. His company used advertising that often went viral instead of relying on a large marketing budget. Their advertisements often contained sexual innuendo as well as topical subjects in pop culture and politics. In January 2016, Baldanza resigned from his position as chief executive officer and president of Spirit, after serving in the position for nearly a decade. The resignation was described by several news organizations as unexpected and abrupt. However, Baldanza stated that the move was part of ‚Äúan orderly succession plan.‚Äù Spirit said that Baldanza had recently moved his family to Washington, D.C. He was replaced by Robert Fornaro, a member of the board since 2014. Baldanza owns Diemacher LLC as an advisory service. He currently serves on the board of JetBlue Airways, Six Flags Entertainment, and GoAir. He serves as an Operating Partner with Sterling Investment Partners He is also an Adjunct Professor of Economics at George Mason University. Beginning in October 2019, he began co- hosting a weekly podcast called Airlines Confidential with media personality Seth Kaplan.Baldanza is a Forbes.com contributor.

A Democrat, he served four years in the Wisconsin State Senate and seven years in the State Assembly representing Racine County. Biography Apple was born in the Palatinate Region in the Kingdom of Bavaria (modern day Germany). He was the eldest of five sons born to Adam and Barbara Beecher Apple. He was raised and worked on his father's farm and was educated in German common schools until age 17, when he set out on his own to emigrate to the United States. He traveled to Rotterdam, in what was then part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and sailed from there to New York City, finally settling in Philadelphia, where he worked as an apprentice cabinetmaker. At the end of his three-year apprenticeship, rather than continuing in that vocation, he set out west to California, following the call of the Gold Rush. After three years mining gold, he returned to Philadelphia, intent on investing his earnings and returning to his cabinetry. Within a year, however, Apple was again drawn to the west and this time moved to the new state of Wisconsin. He settled in the town of Norway, in Racine County, and purchased 120 acres of land. He worked at cultivating the land but soon purchased additional acres, bringing his total estate to nearly 340 acres within a few years. He became renowned in local farming for his cultivation of tobacco. Apple was a life-long member of the Democratic Party, since his early years in the United States, having cast his first vote for Franklin Pierce in 1852. He was elected chairman of the Norway Town Board in the 1870s and served in that role for eight years, and was clerk of the local school board for eighteen years. In 1881 he was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly for Racine County's rural 2nd assembly district, earning re-election in 1882, 1884, and 1886. An 1887 redistricting act reduced the county of Racine from two assembly districts to one, thus eliminating Apple's seat. Apple ran instead, in 1890, for the Wisconsin State Senate in the district encompassing Racine and Kenosha counties, winning a narrow victory in a part of the state that--at the time--generally provided a Republican majority. Apple worked on his farm until age 70, when he began leasing the land to his sons, Charles and Harry. He removed to the neighboring community of North Cape, where he remained until his death in 1905. Apple had been in declining health for several months and underwent an operation in Milwaukee in the weeks before his death. Personal life and family Adam Apple married Dorothea (Dorothy) Eckel in 1856. Dorothy was also a German American immigrant who had been brought to the United States by her parents at age 7. They had eight children together--four sons and four daughters: * Ellen C. (Ella), who married Charles Blakey of Estherville, Iowa, * Adam Jr., who died at age 28, * Josephine, who married Daniel M. Clump of Monmouth, Iowa, * Anna (Annie), a teacher in Mitchellville, Iowa, * Andrew J., living in Chicago, * Charles E. and Harold (Harry), who remained in Norway and took over their father's farms, * and Florence (Flora), the twin of Harry Apple was a devoted Lutheran, a Mason, and a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows.

D. longicaudata is native to many countries in Southeast Asia and subtropical regions and has also been introduced to many other countries as a biological control agent. It is now considered the most extensively used parasitoid for biocontrol of fruit flies in both the southern portion of the United States and Latin America. D. longicaudata is especially useful for agricultural purposes in the control of fruit flies as it is easily mass-reared and has the ability to infect a variety of hosts within the genus Bactrocera. A negative factor in its use as a biocontrol agent is that it is known to oviposit in grapefruit in the state of Florida. This has resulted in quarantines on grapefruit shipped internationally as well as domestically. Research is ongoing to determine whether D. longicaudata is actually a single species, or if it contains multiple species. It is likely multiple biological species separated by both reproductive isolation and morphological characteristics such as wing geometry. Distribution Diachasmimorpha longicaudata originated in the Indo-pacific region of Asia. D. longicaudata has been disseminated into countries in the Americas including United States, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Trinidad, and Brazil. There are stable colonies in Hawaii and Florida in the United States. Morphology The genus Diachasmimorpha has traditionally been defined by the morphology of their apically sinuate ovipositor. D. longicaudata has a body length of between 2.8 and 5.4 mm. The adult male is smaller than the female with a body length of up to 4.0 mm. The body is a reddish-brown color and antennae are longer than the body. Wings are clear. Females have a long ovipositor. The gaster of males and females differs slightly with the female having a dorsal central black band while the gaster of the male has a dark brown to black dorsal posterior. Three cryptic species have been identified within D. longicaudata based on genetic analysis and geometric differences in wing venation. In forced-contact mating between the three cryptic species reproduction was rare and resulted in sterile female offspring. Subspecies have also been reported based on differing geographical areas with high variation being associated variation of resources. As many as five subspecies have previously been identified around the world and have been primarily characterized by color. Life cycle The host organism of Diachasmimorpha longicaudata. Tephritid fruit flies. Pictured is Tephritis formosa. Both males and females are solitary. Third instar tephritid fruit fly larvae are the typical hosts. Female adults of D. longicaudata are attracted to fermenting fruit and then are able to find larvae by sound. Females lay 13-24 eggs per day using her elongated ovipositor to reach the fly larvae. Typically only one egg is laid per instar larvae with exceptions when hosts are insufficient; however only one pupa will reach maturity. Eggs take between two and five days to hatch and will take 18‚Äì23 days to reach adulthood. Male parasitoids develop faster than female, emerging two to three days before females from their host. Symbiotic virus Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entomopoxvirus (DlEPV) is a notable symbiotic virus that affects Diachasmimorpha longicaudata. DlEPV has a double-stranded DNA genome of 250‚Äì300 kb A-T rich with more than 60 of the genome being A-T. During oviposition, the parasitic wasp infects tephritid fruit fly with DlEPV as well as rhabdovirus (DlRhV). Both DlEPV and DlRhV replicate within the epidermal cells of their new host. These viruses are found within the adult wasps and retained in subsequent generations. This is the first symbiotic EPV described to date from a parasitic wasp.

These diseases have been occurring more frequently in the twenty-first century as conditions become more stressful for many shallow-water corals. The pathogens causing the diseases include bacteria, fungi and protozoa, but it is not always possible to identify the pathogen involved. Stress factors Black band disease on a brain coral in the Caribbean Sea Stony corals and soft corals are subject to disease in the same way as other organisms. This may not have been obvious in the past but is becoming increasingly apparent in the twenty-first century. The ill health is the result of the corals being subjected to increasing amounts of stress as the physical environment in which they live becomes less suited to their needs. Corals live within a precise range of environmental conditions including water temperature, salinity and water quality. Variations outside the normal range of these parameters may make the corals less able to grow and reproduce successfully. Of themselves these variations may be insufficient to kill the corals, but they make them more susceptible to disease organisms. The main factor that causes stress to the corals is climate change, with an increase in sea temperatures, particularly affecting shallow-water corals in the tropics. One of the consequences of heat stress is that the coral expels its zooxanthellae and becomes bleached. The rise in sea temperature is also expected to increase the frequency and severity of tropical storms; these adversely affect corals through mechanical damage to reefs, through increased wave action, and through the stirring up and re-deposition of sediment. Other stress factors include increased pollution, increased ultraviolet radiation, and a reduction in the aragonite saturation of surface seawater that is connected with ocean acidification. Although stressed corals are more susceptible to coral diseases, it is infectious organisms that actually cause these diseases. Pathogens so far identified include bacteria, fungi and protozoans. Pathogens Coral diseases mostly take the form of a narrow band of diseased tissue separating the living tissue from the exposed skeleton. The band moves across the surface of the colony at the rate of a few millimetres a day, leaving behind bare skeletal material that is rapidly colonized by algae. Many of the diseases that affect corals are known by their most obvious symptoms such as black band disease, white pox and yellow-band disease. However in many instances it has not been possible to identify the pathogens responsible for the disease and culture them in the laboratory; that the coral is sick and the tissue is necrotic is apparent, but whether the fungi or bacteria present caused the disease or merely fed on the already dying tissue is not clear. There is also a minute crab a millimetre or so wide which is often associated with diseased corals, but whether it introduces the disease or just moves in to consume the necrotic tissue is uncertain. Some of the bacteria found on diseased corals are terrestrial species that are not normally considered pathogenic. Further research has shown that viruses may be involved in white plague infections, the coral small circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses being present in association with diseased tissue. Viruses in this group are known to cause disease in some plants and animals. Distribution Corals growing in the Caribbean Sea are particularly affected by disease, perhaps because of the limited water circulation and the density of the human population on the surrounding land masses. Disease is also present in the tropical Indo-Pacific, but it is not so widespread, perhaps because of the more dispersed locations of the reefs. Bacterial Communities The bacterial communities in coral reefs are similar overall, but for each individual coral the bacterial community can differ greatly. Coral is thought to follow the ‚ÄúAnna Karenina Hypothesis‚Äù. This means that healthy coral will have similar bacterial communities, but diseased corals that are infected with the same disease will have different bacterial communities. Coral diseases * Aspergillosis, caused by the fungus Aspergillus sydowii, affects Gorgonian soft corals commonly known as sea fans. * White pox disease, caused by Serratia marcescens. * Black necrosing syndrome, or Dark spots disease, probably fungal. * Black band disease, probably caused by an assortment of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic bacteria. * Brown band disease, or Red band disease, probably caused by protozoa (possibly Helicostoma nonatum) and cyanobacteria. * Rapid Wasting, possibly caused by a fungus growing on areas damaged by the feeding of the Stoplight parrotfish. * White band disease, the cause of this disease remains unknown. * White plague, sometimes caused by the bacterium Aurantimonas coralicida. * Skeletal eroding band, caused by the protozoan Halofolliculina corallasia. * Yellow-band disease, possibly caused by a unidentified species of Vibrio.

His best known work is the musical Buddy ‚Äì The Buddy Holly Story (widely credited with being the first of the so-called ‚Äòjukebox musicals‚Äô) which ran for over 14 years and almost 6,000 performances in London‚Äôs West End, and has been on tour in the UK for 17 years. Buddy has also played Broadway, 5 U.S. National Tours, 8 years in Germany, 3 years in Australia and New Zealand and countless other productions around the world leading to the show being named as ‚ÄòThe World‚Äôs Most Successful Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll Musical‚Äô. Career Following his first Z-Cars episode, Two Wise Monkeys, Janes contributed further episodes to Z-Cars; Bit Of Business; Fat Freddy B.A., and then moved with producer Ron Craddock to write the first episodes of the ground-breaking and hard-hitting hospital drama Angels. Janes continued to write while working at the BBC Television Script Unit and wrote many further episodes for Angels and original plays and classic series adaptations for BBC Radio including Lady Chatterley‚Äôs Lover by DH Lawrence, Our Man In Havana and Brighton Rock by Graham Greene, Plain Murder by CS Forester, Lord Raingo by Arnold Bennett. In the latter half of the 1970s Janes joined the writing team for the soap opera Emmerdale and in 1979 was invited by BBC head of children‚Äôs programmes Anna Home, to work with Phil Redmond, writer/devisor, and Colin Cant, producer, on the expansion of Grange Hill from its initial run to an 18 episode continuing series. He stayed writing for Grange Hill for a total of 4 series, spending more time at this fictitious school than he did at his own secondary modern school in the East End. In the early 1980s Janes devised and wrote the children‚Äôs series Jockey School for BBC1 and wrote 3 films under the generic title of Prisoners Of Conscience for BBC2: Vladimir Bukovsky, William Beausire, and Nelson Mandela. This period saw Janes write for Minder and pen a film for David Putnam, Winter Flight, directed by Roy Battersby, and a film adaptation with Jim Henson‚Äôs Creature Shop of George Orwell‚Äôs Animal Farm, directed by John Stephenson. Buddy A late-night fan based conversation in a London bar in 1988 with the theatrical agent Laurie Mansfield about the legendary rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roller Buddy Holly, led Janes to develop and write Buddy - The Buddy Holly Story, which opened at London‚Äôs Victoria Palace Theatre on 12 October 1989. Referred to as the first of the so called ‚ÄòJukebox Musicals‚Äô. Buddy ran in London‚Äôs West End for over 14 years, playing 5822 performances. Janes took over the producing of the show himself in 2004 and Buddy has been on tour in the UK for 17 of the last 24 years and has played Broadway, 5 U.S. National Tours, Canada, Sweden, South Africa, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, Holland, Singapore, Finland, Austria and Denmark. Janes was nominated for an Olivier Award for Best Musical, and internationally Buddy has received 29 nominations and awards. Janes co-wrote and produced the soul musical 125th Street, which played at the Shaftesbury Theatre during 2002/3 and co-wrote and produced West End musical hit Jailhouse Rock, at the Piccadilly Theatre during 2004-2005. Channel 4 1980/81 saw the planning of Britain‚Äôs newest channel, Channel 4, and Janes became one of the first of the new breed of Independent Producers when he was commissioned by Mike Bolland, Commissioning Editor ‚Äì Entertainment, and Jeremy Isaacs, Chief Executive, to develop, write and produce a new hard hitting comedy/drama reflecting the effects of ‚ÄòThatcher's Britain‚Äô on young people in the East End of London; it became the 12 episode film series Prospects, which was filmed during 1984/5 in London‚Äôs docklands and aired on Channel 4 in 1986 and repeated on ITV in 1987. Further producer credits for Janes at Channel 4 included 14 episodes over two series of the sit-com Rude Health starring John Wells and the plays Rotten Apples; It‚Äôs Only Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll; The End and Positively Negative.

Courtlandt Place is a member of the Neartown Houston Association. Overview West gate at Courtlandt Place View of the Courtlandt Place esplanade from the west gate Courtlandt Place is a subdivision of Houston, Texas. Courtlandt Place Historic District has been NRHP-listed since 1980, and the district includes eleven houses which carry individual NRHP-listings. \\"Courtlandt Place\\" denotes a residential boulevard, a subdivision, and a Historic District, all of which occupy the same location. The Courtlandt Improvement Company developed Courtlandt Place as a single street, gated on both ends, based on private places in St. Louis, which are designed to restrict access to non-residents. Although the company began planning and building infrastructure in 1906, the first houses were built in 1909 or 1910. The Courtlandt Improvement Association also established extensive deed restrictions which regulated house size, land use, and minimum building cost. Unlike many covenants which specified a length of tenure, Courtlandt Place restrictions were written to never expire. In addition, they prohibited all forms of commercial land use. What made Courtlandt Place a private place was its private street. The residents owned the street, not the City of Houston, nor any other government entity. The residents faced a challenge from a developer of an adjacent neighborhood. John Wesley Link, who laid out a landscaped Montrose Boulevard with termini at Hathaway Avenue (now part of Westheimer) and Richmond Avenue, built his own mansion west of Courtlandt Place. Attracting high-dollar lot sales would be difficult without good street access to downtown. His Lovett Boulevard was blocked by a wall at the west end of Courtlandt Place, and he lobbied the City of Houston to condemn the private street in order to make it a public one. Anticipating that the City of Houston would win its suit against them, the residents of Courtlandt Place agreed to a compromise with the City of Houston near the end of 1912: they would open access to their street in exchange for city services. These included street paving and maintenance, installation of lights, and a promise to control traffic. For seventy years, Courtlandt Place remained a public street until the neighborhood paid $103,115 to the City of Houston to re-privatize the street, which allowed them to rebuild the western gate. History of houses and residents Notable architects who designed houses in the neighborhood included Birdsall Briscoe, Alfred C. Finn, John Fanz Staub, Carlos B. Schoeppl, Sanguinet & Staats, and Warren and Wetmore. Fourteen of the properties were developed between 1910 and 1916, while the other five properties were developed between 1920 and 1927. C. L. Neuhaus House The C. L. \\"Baron\\" Neuhaus House at 6 Courtlandt Place was designed in the Colonial Revival style by Sanguinet & Staats for the local banker in 1910 (NRHP-listed). This was the first home finished in the subdivision. The property also included outbuildings, partly to support small- scale farming activities. The lot included a hen house, two stables, a garage, and servants quarters. The house is named for Franz Charles \\"Charley\\" Ludwig Neuhaus (18571930). Originally from Hackberry, Texas, he moved to Houston in 1906, where he served as a director for the Texas Rice Mill Company and Union National Bank, and was an investment banker. He co-founded the Houston Golf Club and he joined the Houston Country Club as a charter member. He was a developer of Courtlandt Place as he was a principal of the Courtlandt Investment Company, and also served as a trustee. His wife, Emilie \\"Millie\\" Joanna Boettcher Neuhaus (18611843), came from a family of Central Texas Germans, and she hired cooks who knew the food of this culture. As a child, Millie left Texas to attend school in Germany. Sterling Myer House The Sterling Myer House at 4 Courtlandt Place (NRHP-listed) was another home built in 1910 by Sanguinet & Staats. Sterling Myer (1872‚Äî1938), from Plantersville, Texas, was the managing partner of the Courtlandt Improvement Company. He was a partner with the legal firm Campbell and Myer, which also represented Courtlandt Place until 1912. Sterling and his wife Alice Bentley Myer (1873‚Äî1968) resided there for just a few years. A. S. Cleveland House Photograph of Alexander Sessums Cleveland, before 1922 The A. S. Cleveland House at 8 Courtlandt Place (NRHP-listed) was built by Alfred C. Finn and Sanguinet & Staats in 1911. The Colonial Revival includes some Italian Renaissance details. NRIS-79002958. However, another source credits design to A.E. Barnes with Sanguinet & Staats. John Staub executed a commission in 1929 to redesign the interiors. Staub added a first floor dressing room, and decorated the living room with birch paneling and the fireplace with marble cladding. Alexander Sessums \\"Sess\\" Cleveland (18711954) was a son of W.D. Cleveland, the owner of the leading grocery and cotton factoring house in Houston. The elder Cleveland's business later fell into distress, but two of his sons were able to cover his debts. Sess sold the cotton factoring house, prior to falling prices for the commodity during the 1920s. He married Virginia Cunningham (18751965) of Savannah, Georgia in 1896. The couple lived in this house from 1911 to 1950. Cleveland was a cotton factor and grocer in Houston. He was also a civic leader, serving as president of the American Red Cross (Houston Chapter), president of the Houston Chamber of Commerce, trustee for Rice University and University of the South, and served on the Houston school board. Their daughter and their son-in-law, William A. Kirkland, moved into this house sometime in the 1950s. The Kirklands previously resided 10 Courtlandt Place. James L. Autry House James L. Autry House, 5 Courtlandt Place, Houston, Texas, 1912 The James L. Autry House (Courtlandt Place, Houston), 5 Courtlandt Place, was a house designed and built for James Lockhart Autry, II by the Houston office of Sanguinet & Staats in 1912 (NRHP- listed). The house is still used as a residence and is NRHP-listed. Autry was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi in 1859 and moved to Texas in 1876. Autry served as a general counsel for Joseph Cullinan's oil ventures, following Cullinan to the Texas Company, better known as Texaco. The lot at 3 Courtlandt Place was developed concurrently with 5 Courtlandt Place in 1912. J. J. Carroll House The J.J. Carroll House at 16 Courtlandt Place (NRHP-listed) was built in the neoclassical style by Birdsall Briscoe in 1912. However, another account claims that Carroll himself used a pattern design for the house, the only home in Courtlandt Place which was not a custom design. In 1924, the Carrolls commissioned Briscoe to make extensive enhancements to the interior. The house is named for Judson J. Carroll (18771938), who married Lena Carter (18791971), a daughter of W.T. and Maude Carter, and a sister of Frankie Carter Randolph, all Courtlandt Place residents. Judson had worked as an executive for the Carter Lumber Company, but he is better known as an expert avocationist on regional ornithology, and won awards for his photography in the field. He was an advocate for protecting coastal environments for birds, and was honored with the naming of Carroll Island, along the southern Texas coast. For a time, his house served as a regional office for the Audubon Society. The house was restored in the 1970s. W. T. Carter Jr. House The W. T. Carter Jr. House at 18 Courtlandt Place (NRHP- listed) was also designed by Birdsall Briscoe in 1912, and was the only home in Courtlandt Place built in the Prairie style. Briscoe collaborated with Olle J. Lorehn. The house was built for W. T. \\"Bill\\" Carter Jr. (18871957) and Lillie Neuhaus Carter (18901966). Bill was both the nephew and adopted son of W. T. Carter Sr., of 14 Courtlandt Place. Starting in 1919, Bill assumed the management of W. T. Carter's banking and real estate interests, and later built a formidable real estate empire of his own, including his Carter Investment Company. He was the brainchild of the Houston International Airport, later known as Hobby Airport. E. L. Neville House Birdsall Briscoe built this Tudor home at 11 Courtlandt Place in 1914. Edwin Linscott \\"Ned\\" Neville (18791937) was a native of Virginia who moved to Houston in 1896. He was a business partner with cotton merchant and Courtlandt Place resident, John Dorrance. During World War I, he was the deputy State Food Administrator. He chaired the board at Jefferson Davis Hospital. He married Daphne Palmer (18791949) in 1912, who later founded the Houston Junior League. She was the granddaughter of Houston banker, Benjamin A. Shepherd.Gordon and Jones (2009), pp. 6063. Mrs. W. T. Carter Sr. House The Mrs. W.T. Carter Sr. House at 14 Courtlandt Place was another Tudor-style home on the block that was designed by Birdsall Briscoe. The home was completed in 1920. W.T. \\"Will\\" Carter (18561921) built this house for his wife, Maude Holley Carter (18581929), the second home he established after moving his company headquarters and his family to Houston in 1908. Will Carter continued to spend his time managing sawmill operations in Polk County, Texas, while maintaining a mansion on Main Street. By this time, Carter owned several sawmills in East Texas, with banking and real estate interests in Houston. In 1920, he moved into the Tudor home with his wife and their daughter, Frankie Carter Randolph, who also brought her family. The patriarch died the next year. Prior to her family locating in Courtlandt Place, Frankie Carter (18941972) attended the Baldwin School in Pennsylvania. Aubrey, her older brother, matriculated at the University of Virginia during part of her time at the Baldwin School. In 1918, Frankie married Aubrey's college classmate, Robert Decan \\"Deke\\" Randolph (18911989). Prior to their union Deke served the United States Naval Air Corps in France. In 1920, Deke and Frankie Randolph Carter moved their family to her parents‚Äô home at 14 Courtlandt Place. Deke entered the family business, working for the Carter Lumber Company. After 1924, he began a long career in banking. Frankie Carter Randolph was a founding member of the Houston Junior League and the League of Women Voters. She was the first white Houstonian to join the NAACP. She was a Democratic activist, who supported the candidacy of Adlai Stevenson for President of the United States. J. W. Garrow House The J. W. Garrow House at 19 Courtlandt Place represents the third Birdsall Briscoe design in the neighborhood from 1914, this one a Colonial Revival/Beaux Arts hybrid. John Wanroy Garrow (18791944) was from a second generation of Houston cotton merchants in his family and a president of the Houston Cotton Exchange. He was a director for several local companies, including the American General Insurance Company. He married Marie Etta Brady (18871941), daughter of John Brady, a founder of the Houston Ship Channel Company and a real estate developer.Gordon and Jones (2009), pp. 6769. John M. Dorrance House The John M. Dorrance House at 9 Courtlandt Place (NRHP- listed) is a stucco house designed by Sanguinet & Staats in 1914. John Dorrance (18521935}} spent six decades in the cotton business. He came to Houston in 1891 to work for H. H. Garrow and Company. Before the turn of the century he started Dorrance and Company. He was vice-president of the Houston Cotton Exchange. He developed real estate in downtown Houston, including the Savoy Apartments, and the Dorrance building at 114 Main Street. He was married to Ada Knapp Dorrance (18601933), and they had two daughters and two sons.Gordon and Jones (2009), pp. 5557. Thomas J. Donoghue House The Thomas J. Donoghue House at 17 Courtlandt Place (NRHP-listed) was designed for the executive vice-president of the Texas Company in 1916 by Warren and Wetmore, the firm that designed Grand Central Station in New York City. Thomas J. \\"T. J.\\" Donoghue (18691945) was born in the Pennsylvania oilfields to a local refiner. When he was a young teenager, he sold newspapers and worked for Western Union. After eighteen years of employment at Standard Oil, he accepted a job from J. S. Cullinan in Texas. He was a colleague of James Autry at the Texas Company. He married Mamie Sullivan (18751963) in 1896. He was engaged with many local and national non-profits, most of which had Christian affiliations.Gordon and Jones (2009), pp. 8386. Judson L. Taylor House The Judson Taylor House at 20 Courtlandt Place (NRHP-listed) is the last of six works that Birdsall Briscoe completed in the neighborhood, a Colonial Revival finished in 1916. This house was originally home to Dr. Judson Ludwell Taylor (18811944) and Jessie Carter Taylor (18811947). Jessie was a daughter of Maude and W. T. Carter Sr. The couple married in 1903, the same year Judson earned a degree in medicine from the University of Texas. In 1912, Dr. Taylor retired from the United States Navy and established a general surgery practice. He later specialized in orthopedic surgery, practicing at Houston Shriners' Hospital and Hermann Hospital. He later co-founded Jefferson Davis Hospital, where he also worked as an surgeon. He assumed various leadership positions within the Houston medical community, including the Baylor College of Medicine, and the Harris County Medical Society. On the other hand, Jessie used the house for unconventional entertainment. During prohibition, she transformed her basement into a gambling room and also sponsored boxing matches. Underwood Nazro House Underwood Nazro House, viewed from Lovett Boulevard The Underwood Nazro House at 25 Courtlandt Place is a Colonial Revival completed in 1916. Sanguinet & Staats designed this home, and it represents their seventh and last commission in the neighborhood. Underwood Nazro (18751935) was an officer of Gulf Oil Company and one of its initial investors. Nazro was a native of Kentucky. After moving to Texas, he married Clara Wheeler (18821942) of Beaumont, Texas, whose family money capitalized Nazro's ventures. The couple moved to River Oaks before 1935.Gordon and Jones (2009), pp. 8890. JonesHunt House The JonesHunt House at 24 Courtlandt Place (NRHP-listed) was built in 1920. Alfred C. Finn, this time commissioning residential work with his own firm, moved an 1890 Victorian structure to the site and added brick cladding to recreate it in a Spanish-mode. In all, Finn performed architectural work on three properties in the neighborhood, two while he worked for Sanguinet & Staats, and the Jones-Hunt House, which was designed by his own firm. Sarah Brashear Jones was the mother of Murray Brashear Jones, who moved into the house next door in 1925. She purchased the lot from Captain James Addison Baker. Her father, Isaac Brashear, first arrived in Houston in 1839, just a few years after the city's founding, and established a farm that was later a part of the Houston Heights. Murray B. Jones House The Murray B. Jones House at 22 Courtlandt Place is a stucco building with colonial elements, completed in 1925. The architect is unknown according to one source. Another source attributes the architectural work to Birdsall Briscoe, and characterizes the style as Georgian Revival. The Murray B. Jones House represents Courtlandt Place connections to an old-guard Houston family. Captain James A. Baker purchased the lot, then built this home for his daughter Alice Baker Jones (18871978) and her husband, Murray Brashear Jones (18861963). Captain Baker practiced law with Baker, Botts, and Baker, a top law firm in Houston founded by his father, who was also named James Addison Baker. The Bakers were long-associated with William Marsh Rice, and the firm bearing their name represented Rice's estate after he died under suspicious circumstances. Murray Jones also had deep Houston roots, though with humbler origins through his grandfather, Isaac Brashear. Murray matriculated at the University of Texas and Princeton University, and again at the University of Texas to study law. He practiced law in Texas between 1910 and 1960. However, Murray and Alice Jones did not stay together for much longer, divorcing in the 1920s. Alice remained in the house until 1946. Johnelle Bryan House The Johnelle Bryan House at 15 Courtlandt Place is of an Italian Renaissance design by Carlos B Schoeppl, his only commission in the neighborhood, which he finished in 1925. Also known as the Bryan-Chapman House, the original residents were Caroline Bryan Chapman (18591933) and Johnelle Bryan (18611935). Their three brothers died in the Civil War, and they lost their father in 1867. The sisters hosted musical performances in this house, and were local patrons of the performing arts. Joseph F. and Wadesha Bashara acquired the home in 1935, and like the previous owners, they used it as a venue for live music.Gordon and Jones (2009), pp. 119120. John W. Parker House The John W. Parker House at 25 Courtlandt Place (NRHP-listed) represents the only work in Courtlandt Place by John Fanz Staub (1925-1926).

It consisted of one DHC-3 Otter plane and one Alouette III helicopter, both carrying rocket pods and machine guns for launching hit-and-run attacks on Pakistani targets, and one DC-3 Dakota for logistical missions. 9 Bengali pilots and 58 ex PAF personnel formed the unit under the command of Group Captain A. K. Khandker in September 1971. The aircraft were supplied by Indian Authorities and the formation was led by Squadron Leader Sultan Mahmud under the operational control of IAF base Jorhat. The unit started training in October 1971 at Dimapur in Nagaland, and this unit was the first to launch airstrikes on Pakistani targets in occupied Bangladesh on December 4, 1971 by attacking oil depots at Narayanganj and Chittagong. In total the unit flew 90 sorties and 40 combat missions between December 4 and December 16, 1971. After the war it formed the core of the nascent Bangladesh Air Force. Background The Partition of British India led to the assets and personnel of British Indian Armed Forces being divided between India and Pakistan in 1947. Pakistan concentrated most of her military assets in West Pakistan,Major Nasir Uddin, Juddhey Juddhey Swadhinata, p. 47. and the first combat aircraft deployed in East Pakistan was a squadron of Hawker Fury biplanes in 1956.

This eventually led to Awami League launching a non cooperation movement that eventually confined the authority of the Central government to the cantonments and government institutions in East Pakistan.Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, pp. 48‚Äì51 Pakistani government decided to launch a military crackdown and began to move soldiers in civilian clothes to Dhaka using PIA and PAF aircraft from February 1971.

The Awami League leadership, attempting a political solution,Salik, Siddiq, 'Witness to Surrender', p64 did not endorse any preemptive action or preparation for conflict by Bengali soldiers. Warnings by Bengali officers that the Pakistan Army was preparing to strike were ignored, and junior Bengali officers were told by their superiors to be prudent and avoid political issues. Osmani also advised the Bengali officers against \\"rash\\" actions. The Pakistan Army caught the Bengali political leadership and soldiers by surprise. Bengali PAF personnel in Mukti Bahini Initial Bengali resistance to Pakistani Military action was spontaneous and disorganized. Bengali soldiers were largely unaware of the larger situation; many units continued to performed routine duties until 31 March, rebelling only after coming under Pakistani attack. Group Captain A.K. Khandkar, OC Admin Wing of PAF East Pakistan, had witnessed the departure of Yahia Khan from East Pakistan prior to start of Pakistani attack on March 25 and warned Awami League members, and he had earlier also warned Sheikh Mujibur Rahman regarding Pakistani troop movements.Salik, Siddiq, 'Witness to Surrender', p70Khandker, Air Vice Marshal (ret.)

The Indian Army had been helping the Mukti Bahini, through Operation Jackpot, since May 1971, while the Indian Navy helped set up the Bengali Naval commando unit and then provided command staff for the Bengali gunboats, which were used to mine riverine craft and harass merchant marine operations in East Pakistan. The IAF had flown reconnaissance flights over East Pakistan since June 1971, but could not come to grips with the PAF until formal hostilities commenced. Former PAF officers and personnel were employed in various Mukti Bahani formations engaged in guerrilla warfare as they joined up, since Mukti Bahini lacked any aircraft or air defense equipment. Group Captain Abdul Karim Khandker became the deputy Chief of Staff of Mukti Bahini, Wing Commander Khademul Bashar, a veteran B-57 pilot, became Commander of Mukti Bahini Sector 6 with Squadron Leader Sadruddin as his deputy, Flt.

Mukti Bahini lacked international recognition as a separate sovereign legal entity, so the Indian Government could not sanction IAF to offer any modern aircraft or use of its official facilities to Mukti Bahini. Bengali diplomats who had left their posts had sent information on aircraft procurement during April - August 1971 to Bangladesh Government, the purchase cost was to be funded by Bengali diaspora, but this ultimately did not materialise. Air Chief Marshall P.C. Lal, then Commander of IAF, Mrs Ila Lal and Khandker had met for dinner in August, and the idea was again discussed. IAF then offered to donate two De Havilland Vampire for Mukti Bahini, or absorb Bengali pilots into Indian Air formations. The Vampire aircraft were obsolete, and Bengali pilots were training in different aircraft, so Mukti Bahini did not take up the offers. P.C. Lal, however, gave a positive recommendation to the Indian government for giving Mukti Bahini an air wing, and a few days later, IAF agreed to provide non- combat aircraft, logistical support and a training ground to Mukti Bahini. Gp.Capt Khandker detailed Flt. Lt. Badrul Alam who was then serving as a staff officer in the Mukti Bahini Headquarter to select pilots and airmen for Mukti Bahini Air wing from September 24, 1971.

Bengali pilots were assembled at Dimapur on September 28, 1971, Most of them were flown in from Agartala.

Gp.Capt. Khandker, along with Flight Lieutenant Shamsul Alam (who escaped from Pakistani captivity on August 5) flew to Dimapur via Gauhati on September 27, and in the presence of Air Chief Marshall P.C. Lal, took delivery and inaugurated the newly formed Bangladesh Air Force. The unit officially became active on September 28, 1971 ‚Äì birth day of Bangladesh Air force. The unit was dubbed\\" Kilo Flight\\", the first fighting formation of the nascent Bangladesh Air force. Pilots Nine pilots were assembled at Dimapur to fly the 3 aircraft. Flight Lieutenant Shamsul Alam, along with Flight Lieutenant Badrul Alam, were PAF trained pilots. They were later joined on October 14, 1971 by Flight Lieutenant Sultan Mahmud, who had been previously wounded in a guerrilla operation in Chittagong, which had delayed his arrival, and he became the Commanding Officer of this unit.Mohan and Chopra. p. 48 Captains Alamgir, Kazi Abdus Sattar, Shahabuddin Ahmed and Abdul Mukeet were F-27 pilots from PIA, while Captain A.S.M.A Khaleque was a PIA veteran with 10,000 hours in a Boeing 707.Mohan and Chopra.

The aircraft would fly low to avoid Radar detection, then pop up to hit their targets, then fly back to base. Bengali pilots became proficient in the risky task of night flying and firing, while the Bengali crew serviced the aircraft during the day to keep them operational. All technical glitches were also ironed out, in one case, when it was found that the fuse of the 57 mm rockets were hitting the tail rotor of the helicopter when the rockets were fired, the fuses were changed.Khandker, Air Vice Marshal (ret.)

Khandker of the first three possible missions, the Dakota would bomb Dacca Airport, the helicopter was to hit the Air Fuel dumps at Godnail near Narayanganj, and the Otter would attack the Eastern Oil Refinery at Chittagong. The Otter and the Alouette would have to refuel on the way to their targets as after starting from Dimapur as the targets lay outside their operational range. Two changes were made before the final missions took place. It was found that when the Dakota pulled up in full throttle after its bombing run, the engine exhaust flames were clearly visible, making them an easy mark for anti aircraft gunners, so the risk was deemed unacceptable and their mission was cancelled.

The IAF command, aware of the significance of the Bangladesh Liberation War, allotted the honor of first strike against Pakistan from the air to Bengali pilots. The first sortie was scheduled to take place on 3 November 1971, then it was moved to 28 November, but again was moved back 6 days, to 2 December 1971.

He was also a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. Despite being born in France to Jacobite parents, he was naturalised at the age of 13 years old on 8 January 1707 as a British subject and was a Protestant. Background Born in France to John King, 3rd Baron Kingston and his wife Margaret O'Cahan, James' father had been a close supporter of king James II of England and following his overthrow fled in exile to France with him. His father was given a pardon on 3 September 1694 by the British government and the new regime in London, switching sides and eventually returned to the Kingdom of Ireland, where he would serve in the Irish House of Lords. The young James King petitioned for naturalisation on 8 January 1707, where he and his siblings were described as \\"born out of her Majesty's allegiance, but are good Protestants.\\" Freemasonry King was a prominent freemason; he was Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England for 1728‚Äî1730 and also Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Ireland for 1731‚Äî1732 and 1735‚Äî1736. As well as his involvement in freemasonry in England and Ireland, he also was involved in freemasonry in France. King was an officer of Masonry in Lyon and was also active in Paris. He was a member of a Masonic lodge in Paris, which had Louis-Marie-Augustin d'Aumont, 4th Duke of Aumont (1709‚Äì1782), as its Grand Master and included notables such as James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave (the Ambassador of Great Britain to France), Louis Ph√©lypeaux, comte de Saint-Florentin (the Foreign Minister of France) and the Enlightenment philosopher Montesquieu. Freemasonry during the early 18th century had somewhat of a Jacobite tinge to it, particularly in France and Ireland. In England, the supporters of the Hanoverians, particularly under Prime Minister Robert Walpole, had decided to move into freemasonry and make it their own, rather than attack it outright or suppress it, as well as this, abroad (especially in Paris) the Hanoverians and Jacobites spied on each other in the masonic lodges. Some persons within freemasonry, such as John Theophilus Desaguliers and James Anderson (author of The Constitutions of the Free-Masons in 1723) were happy to oblige with this Whiggish reorientation. In relation to France, around 1737, Cardinal Andr√©-Hercule de Fleury, the Chief Minister to Louis XV of France was looking to make to make peace with Walpole and Britain. The masonic lodges in France, founded mostly by Jacobite military exiles, were a threat to this deal and so de Fleury directed Ren√© H√©rault to shut them down. He also pressed Pope Clement XII to issue a bull the following year condemning freemasonry. It was into this complex interweaving drama that King became caught up in a significant controversy, which led to the revelation of Masonic rituals to the public in France with the publication of La r√©ception d'un frey-ma√ßon (1737) in La Gazette de Hollande. The police chief H√©rault did not just use physical force against freemasonic lodges, but also sought to elicit intelligence by using the sexual services of certain women. Marie Armabade Carton, a dancer with the Paris Opera who had been a mistress to banker Samuel Demard and Marshal Maurice de Saxe, was used. King had previously seduced her daughter, causing the break-up of a marriage. Upon meeting King in Paris, Carton gave the impression that she was familiar with masonic secrets from past lovers and enticed King to demonstrate his knowledge for sexual favours. Any so-called \\"great secret\\" which H√©rault and de Fleury sought, was not revealed but the rituals of the Craft were exposed to the public and published not only in French, but also the following year in The Gentleman's Magazine. Marriages King married twice during his life. Firstly to Elizabeth Meade, daughter of Sir John Meade, 1st Baronet and former wife of Ralph Freke, with whom he had three children; Margaret, William and Elizabeth King. Later, in July 1751, King married for a second time; this time to Isabella Ogle, daughter of Nathaniel Ogle. No children were born to this marriage. As King's son William died before him, the lands he controlled in County Cork, County Tipperary and County Limerick passed through his daughter Margaret, who was married to Richard FitzGerald. Eventually the lands came back into the King family through the Earls of Kingston.

It has been studied in terms of genetics, endocrinology and neurobiology. Trust is the intentional choice to believe the input of strangers because one believes they know the truth and have one's best interest at heart. Trust is important in creating social attachments. Social bonds is a characteristic present in many mammals and other vertebrae species. However, there exists a paradox in the formation of social bonds in humans- while there are benefits, drawbacks, such as judgment, vulnerabilities to harmful physical and emotional hurt do exist. And overarching all of this is trust, which is marked by the intentional choice to rely on another individual for an underlying purpose, despite drawbacks- a factor in social bonds with biological implications.  Neural Mechanisms  Neuropeptides, specifically oxytocin (OT) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP), have been shown to be involved in physiological mechanisms of social behavior. Sex hormones, have also been correlated. The involvement of OT and AVP in trust and social attachment can be attributed the fact that both molecules can be released as neurotransmitters or hormones throughout the body. OT and AVP act as neurotransmitters when released directly by the hypothalamus; they act as neurohormones when released peripherally by the pituitary gland. So, both AVP and OT are peripheral (functioning throughout the body) and central (functioning within the brain). Both social bonding and social attachment involve OT. In female rats that had OT injected directly into the brain, studies found that the OT rats exhibited full maternal behavior towards foster pups. In studies involving human subjects, increases in OT were observed in subjects who received intentional trust signals in a controlled trust game. When an OT receptor antagonist was injected in rats, it was found that there was a decrease in social recognition and decreased social bonding. In a similar study, injection of central or peripheral OT in the lateral septum or main olfactory bulbs showed an increase in social recognition and interaction. Studies have also shown the integration of OT with Dopamine (DA) and AVP in social bonding. Function of DA neurons on OT receptors bound in the striatum strengthen social attachment by directing the reward pathways in which DA is involved with towards behavioral trust. Social recognition memory also involves AVP. In a study conducted on Brattleboro rats that carried a mutation inhibiting AVP production, injection of central and peripheral AVP was correlated with an improvement in social recognition. As with OT, injection of AVP receptor antagonist was followed by impaired social bonding and recognition. In male titi monkeys, injection of AVP increased social behavior towards their female partner. In human studies, AVP has also shown to increase pro-social behavior towards their significant other. The effects of AVP are reinforced by its integration with OT. In a study in which rats received increased peripheral or central OT and AVP, the rats with increased OT or AVP exhibited an increase in huddling and sharing food with other rats. Social bonding is mediated several brain areas which respond to OT, AVP, and DA. Studies using fMRI have been used in research to assess associated brain areas in human attachment based on auditory and visual stimuli responses of the brain to attachment target. These studies found that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and ventral striatum in the brain were activated during responses to attachment target. Further research in fMRI studies have shown that the amygdala, nucleus accumbens (NA), hypothalamus, sub-cortical and cortical reward neural networks are also involved mediating social attachment. These networks and pathways contain receptors that allow OT, AVP, and DA to exert their effects in high and low level processes in the brain that provide a foundation for social trust. In studies with human subjects who experienced social isolation, there was an increase in activity in the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-a neural network involved in the release of cortisol, a stress-response hormone. This same research showed a deactivation in brain regions associated with OT and AVP.  References  Physiology ","title":"Biology of trust"},{"id":"55490112","text":"Isabella S. Davis Spurlock Isabella Smiley Davis Spurlock (January 21, 1843 ‚Äì October 14, 1906) was a philanthropist. Early life Isabella Smiley Davis Spurlock was born in Nodaway County, Missouri, on January 21, 1843. Her father, William H Davis (1814-1875), was a descendant of Jefferson Davis and was born in Tennessee. Her mother's name was Sarah Elizabeth Windham/Windom (1814-1877), and she belonged to a good family. Davis's child-life was one of care and responsibility, instead of play and pastime. Career Isabella S. Davis Spurlock's first public work was in the interest of foreign missions, organizing societies. During the temperance crusade she was one of the leaders who was active in promoting its ideals. She twice represented the society in national conventions and was State superintendent of mothers' and social purity meetings. She was often a member of committees appointed to confer with important people. In the spring of 1882, she was disabled physically, so that she was obliged to give up all public work, and a year of intense pain followed. She believed prayers of herself and friends cured her and that she received the command to, \\"Go to Utah, and visit the sick and imprisoned.\\" She followed the call and spent two years among the women of Utah. While there, she assisted in opening a day nursery, where Mormon wives could leave their children while they were at work. She led in the movement to organize a Christian association, formed of the women of all denominations, for the assistance of the helpless women of Mormon faith. In 1886 she was made trustee of an orphan's home on a farm in the West. Finally, she persuaded the national executive committee of the Women's Home Missionary Society to adopt the movement, and in 1891 she and her husband were appointed to the superintendency of that work, the Mothers' Jewels' Home, near York, Nebraska.

He was a Spanish Jesuit priest in the first generation of the companions of St. Ignatius of Loyola. A very close collaborator of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus, he was sent to explain to the various Jesuit communities of Europe the first draft of the Constitutions. He is known as the \\"Ignatian theologian\\" for having developed the theology behind Ignatian spirituality.  Elements of biography  Born in Palma de Mallorca on 11 August 1507, Jerome was the eldest of four children of Antonio Nadal, a lawyer by profession, and Maria Morey.La rue o√π se trouve la maison natale de Nadal s'appelle aujourd'hui Calle de Padre Nadal Nadal studied at the University of Alcal√° de Henares (1526) where he met Ignatius for the first time. He kept his distance from Ignatius at this point, since Ignatius was in trouble with the Inquisition. In autumn 1532 Nadal went to the University of Paris to continue his studies. He felt attracted to the priesthood and, while studying mathematics, began to study theology. In the Latin Quarter he ran across his fellow student from Alcala, Ignatius of Loyola, along with Ignatius' group of \\"friends in the Lord\\", Peter Faber, Francis Xavier, and Diego Laynez among others. But he stubbornly refused to join these \\"alumbrados\\" whom he mistrusted. He preferred, he said, the Gospel to their \\"Spiritual Exercises\\", fearing \\"to be dragged out of orthodoxy\\". Like other Spaniards, he had to leave Paris for political reasons in 1536, and continued his training at the University of Avignon (then an enclave of the Papal States). There he gained a remarkable mastery of Hebrew, to the admiration of the Jewish community of the \\"City of the Popes\\". He was offered the position of spiritual director and chief rabbi of Avignon! ... which troubled him. In April 1536 he was ordained a priest by the auxiliary bishop of Avignon, Simon de Podio, and on 11 May he was awarded a doctorate in theology. Returning to his native island and setting himself up for a comfortable ecclesiastical career, he awoke from a \\"deep sleep\\" by reading a copy of the famous letter sent from India by St. Francis Xavier to the clerics of Paris, apostrophising those who, \\"at the University of Paris, have more knowledge than a willingness to prepare themselves to draw fruit from it.\\" He became unsettled. He inquired and discovered \\"Ignatius is superior general! Xavier is in India! A religious order, the 'Society of Jesus', is approved! What amazing developments! I will immediately go to Rome to meet Ignatius and find out what happened.\\"Nadal dans son Chronicon Natalis, 1545. He went to Rome and at thirty-eight entered the Society of Jesus. Ignatius quickly noticed his gifts and made him a trusted associate, a \\"contemplative in action\\" as Nadal would describe the Ignatian ideal. He was entrusted the important task of founding the Jesuit College, Messina, the first college opened by the Jesuits, in 1548. He proceeded to travel and explain the newly formulated Constitutions of the Society of Jesus to the Jesuits in Italy, Spain, and Portugal. He reported to Ignatius the reactions, which were incorporated into the final draft of the Constitutions. In 1554 Ignatius, two years before his death, appointed Nadal Vicar General of the Society. At the General Congregation of 1558, which elected Diego Laynez as Ignatius' successor, as well as later, he was often consulted as being the one who, having been a very close collaborator with the Society's founder, best expressed his thoughts. Jerome Nadal died on 3 April 1580 at the San Andrea del Quirinale novitiate in Rome. right  Evangelical images  The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola employ as a higher form of prayer what Ignatius calls the \\"application of the senses\\" to the scenes in the Gospels. By contemplating these scenes, along with Jesus' words and actions, one is able to take on the values of Jesus in one's own life. Shortly before Ignatius' death, he asked Nadal to oversee a project of producing engravings to facilitate these \\"contemplations\\" of Jesus in the Gospels. These were meant especially to assist Jesuit novices, for a thirty-day retreat using the Spiritual Exercises was a part of every Jesuit's novitiate. Nadal commissioned several artists to do the engravings, 153 in all, and himself wrote extended captions which included references to parts of the scenes. The engravings, Evangelicae Historiae Imagines, were published in Antwerp in 1593, thirteen years after Nadal's death. This is the oldest collection of such engravings that are extant; they use the art of perspective which was new at the time.

The city was once the capital of the Sharbhapuriya and Somavamshi kings of Dakshina Kosala state. It was an important Hindu, Buddhist and Jain settlement of the South Kosala kingdom between the 5th and the 12th century CE. It was visited by Hieun Tsang, the 7th century Chinese Buddhist pilgrim. Recent excavations have uncovered 12 Buddhist viharas, 1 Jain vihara, monolithic statues of Buddha and Mahavira, 22 Shiva temples and 5 Vishnu temples, Shakti and Tantric temples, underground granary market and a sixth-century bath house. History Sirpur relief excavated: she steps on his feet, seeks forgiveness with a namaste gesture. Sirpur, also referred to as Shripur and Sripura (literally, \\"city of auspiciousness, abundance, Lakshmi\\") in ancient Indian texts and inscriptions, is a village on the Mahanadi River east of Raipur. Allahabad Pillar inscription dated 4th century AD during the reign Samudragupta mentions Sirpur as Sripura. In the second half of the 1st millennium CE, it was the capital city with major commercial and religious significance for the Dakshina Kosala kingdom. The earliest documented evidence states that it was first a capital of Sharabhapuriya dynasty, followed by Panduvamshi dynasty. The Sharabhapuriya dynasty itself is dated to the late 5th century CE, but inscriptions mention its first capital to be Sharabhapura, as yet an unknown site. The abundant inscriptions of the mid-6th century CE in the region mention the Hindu Shaiva king Teevardeva and 8th-century king Shivagupta Balarjuna establishing temples and monasteries for Hindus, Buddhists and Jains in his kingdom. The Chinese pilgrim and traveller Huen T'sang mentions visiting Sirpur in 639 CE in his memoirs. He wrote that the king was a Kshatriya and benevolent to the Buddhists, the region was prosperous. According to his memoir, some 10,000 Mahayana Buddhist bhikshus (monks) lived here in some 100 monasteries, and there were over 100 temples. The earliest dated Sirpur monument is the Lakshmana temple, dated to 595-605 CE. Along with it, numerous other temples along the Mahanadi River stretching over from Rajim to Kharod have been located and dated to between 600 and 710 CE. The South Kosala kingdom, along with the capital Sirpur, was taken over by the Kalachuri dynasty in the 11th century, with eastern parts of the South Kosala taken over by the Somavamshi kingdom to their east. The 12th century and 13th century history of the region is unclear. Excavations in the region have yielded layers of deposits, traceable from the mid 1st millennium BCE, the Gupta Empire period, through the late medieval period with the youngest layer of deposits being ruins mixed with chilum (smoke pipe) and Sultanate era coins suggesting that Sirpur was an active human settlement at least through the early Delhi Sultanate. Archaeological site Sirpur became a major archaeological site after it was visited in 1882 by Alexander Cunningham, a colonial British India official. His report on a Laxman (Lakshmana) temple at Sirpur brought it to international attention. The site remained neglected in early 20th-century during the decades of the World Wars, and excavations resumed in 1953. There were further excavations in 1990s and then particularly after 2003 when 184 mounds were identified and some selectively excavated. Those excavations have so far yielded 22 Shiva temples, 5 Vishnu temples, 10 Buddha Viharas, 3 Jain Viharas, a 6th/7th century market and snana-kund (bath house). The site shows extensive syncretism, where Buddhist and Jain statues or motifs intermingle with Shiva, Vishnu and Devi temples. There are two theories on the demise of Sirpur city and what led to the capital's sudden ruin. One posits that an earthquake leveled the entire region and people abandoned the capital and the kingdom. Another posits a catastrophic destruction after invasion and plunder. Coins of Sultan Alaud din Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate have been found among the ruins, and the stairs of one of the monuments show signs of partial caving in, neither establishes nor rules out the proposals. The discovery of Khalji era coins mixed with the ruins during the excavation can be attributed to other reasons such as trade between Delhi Sultanate and Dakshina Kosala kingdom, and a spot caving in can be because of localized soil subsidence. Sirpur is also a major archaeological site for \\"bronze sculptures from the early medieval period\\". According to Geri Hockfield Malandra, Sirpur was a significant bronze workshop of ancient India and the Buddhist bronze artwork excavated from Sirpur are among the \\"finest bronze sculptures\\" of that era. There are striking similarities between the artwork in Sirpur and the Ellora Caves as well as Ratnagiri, according to Malandra, and this may suggest a flow of ideas and artists between the two regions. Hindu monuments Laxman temple at Sirpur Lakshmana temple The Lakshmana temple, also spelled Laxman temple, is a 7th-century brick temple, mostly damaged and ruined. The garbhagriya entrance along with the tower and door carvings of the Lakshmana temple at Sirpur are reasonably intact enough to be studied. Above the sanctum door's lintel are carvings show a reclining Vishnu on Sesha (Anantasayana Vishnu) and a panel on Krishna from Bhagavata Purana. Around the door are bands of carvings which show the ten avatars of Vishnu along with daily life and couples in various stages of courtship and mithuna. The temple stands on a stone jagati platform (about 40'x80') with wide enough space for circumambulation. The temple itself is built of brick except for the carved frame around the grabha-griya (sanctum) made of stone. The sanctum opens to the east. In front of the sanctum is the outline of an antarala (vestibule), and an oblong mandapa (ceremonial community hall). The hall shows stub places for pillars, all now lost to history. Except for the sanctum and the tower, much is in ruins. The sanctum stone frame outside is a 22x22 feet square, inside it is about 10x10 feet square. The sanctum walls are plain like typical Hindu temples. The original statue of sanctum is missing. The site management has installed several small statues for visitors from what was found in the ruins pile. Rama temple Rama temple is situated less than 100 meters southeast of the Lakshmana temple, but it is almost entirely in ruins. The Rama temple site, however, does preserve the foundation outline of several shrines as well as brick stub of the lower part of the original Rama temple. Immediately to the north of the Rama temple is an outline which local tradition states was also dedicated to Lakshmana as Rama-Lakshmana pair. The Rama temple follows a stellate (star- shape) jagati pattern, while its Lakshmana pair was without one. The mandapa and other features of the Rama were destroyed long ago, according to Donald Stadtner, and the Rama temple site is likely to be from about 600 CE. This is one of the earliest star shape jagati platform temple in central India. It may have served as a prototype practice temple, before Sirpur architects of the 7th century built much grander stellate-principle Hindu temples in Kharod, Palari and Rajim. Artwork on the riverside walls of Gandheshwar Shiva temple. Gandheshwar temple Gandheshwar Temple: an active Shiva temple, Gandheshwar temple is situated on the banks of the Mahanadi River. From the river, there are stone stairs to walk to the sanctum. The temple is routinely re-washed and re-painted. It likely includes recovered ruins from the area, in which the locals have included Hindu, Buddhist and Jain iconography. A stone slab that is part of the temple wall has a Sanskrit inscription in Nagari script, starting with Om symbol and dedicated to Shiva, which has been dated to the 8th-century. Baleshwar Mahadev temples Baleshwar Mahadev temples group: A Shiva temple about 50 meter northwest of the Teevar dev monument, across the Sirpur road. It consists of several temples. For three Shiva temples excavated, a circumambulatory Jagati in the form of a high rise platform, similar to Lakshmana temple survives. For another only the foundation is visible. The cluster was built by the Shaiva king Shivagupta Balarjuna, and is dated to the mid 8th century. Two of the temple are located side by side, and unlike most Sirpur temples, these open to the west. Both have a mandapa, an antarala and have a star shaped garbha griya made out of bricks and stone. The stellate sanctum is formed out of two squares, one rotated by 45 degrees. Some of the artwork discovered during excavations are displayed, and these show women and couple standing dressed up in 8th-century attire. The sanctum has Shiva linga made from marble. Surang tila temple, Sirpur. Surang tila Surang tila: It is the largest temple complex in Sirpur, with a pillared terrace raised 30 feet above the group, stone steps connecting the terrace to the ruined mandapa platform remains below. The stairs have partially caved it in a spot from ground subsidence. The pillared terrace on the top was likely a mandapa, as it has ruins of many carved pillars in navaranga pattern. The terrace connects with five sanctums, which have two gray Shiva linga, one features a black granite Shiva linga and other two are dedicated to Vishnu. The temple is made out of white stone. It used to be a soil mound with tunnels (surang) used by the locals, but the temple was excavated between 2006 and 2007. An inscription was found during the excavation which is now in the Raipur museum. According to this inscription, this temple was operating during the time of Shivagupta Balarjuna, and the temple is dated to 7th or 8th century. Below the temple terrace, are ruins of two buildings, one likely a residence for priests and monks, another a small tantric temple with 16-edge Shiva linga possibly from later centuries. Other monuments Rakela Tal, fort ruins and other temples: located south near the Rama temple on the east side of the Sirpur road is a man made lake full of lotus flowers. Around the lake are ruins of an old fort, several Hindu and Buddhist monuments mixed in with farmlands and a modern era Krishna temple. Sirpur has over 20 other excavated medieval temples and 50 additional unexcavated mounds spread over a three square kilometres area. Buddhist monuments A Buddha statue excavated from monastery ruins. Ananda Prabhu vihara Ananda Prabhu Kuti vihara: a temple and 14-room monastery, built by Bhikshu Anand Prabhu, called Ananda Prabha in some inscriptions, with sponsorship from the Hindu king Sivagupta Balarjuna. The monastery and temple ruins included a monument to Avalokite≈õvara and Makarwahini Gange. A stone inscription found at the site, in Sanskrit written in Nagari script and dated to mid 8th century CE uses a mix of Vedic meters (Anustubh, Sragdhara, Arya, Vasantatilaka and others). The inscription states starts with auspicious symbol Om and Siddham, praises Sugata (Buddha) then lauds king Balarjuna. It thereafter mentions monk Anandaprabha, devoted to the Buddha the Maravarin (enemy of Mara) and the destroyer of the cycle of rebirth and death. The inscription says the king established a \\"vihara kuti\\" (monastery residences) and a free feeding house for all the monks there furnished with setike and vyanjana (rice meal with condiments) for \\"so long as the sun adorns the sky\\" (perpetuity). The inscription poem thereafter reminds the monks to remember the spirit of the king's gift, the impermanence of wealth, that dharma is the only saving grace to suffering-filled worldly existence. The inscription is signed by the artist who created it for the monastery. Swastika vihara Swastika vihara: excavated in the 1950s, the aerial view of this monument's layout reminds of the swastika sign. This site yielded a Buddha statue and metallic idols relating to the Buddhist era. Along with Buddha was the image of Padamapani carrying a fly whisk. An excavated Sirpur Shiva temple Teevardev Teevar dev: a monastery from the Dakshina Kosala era, this Vihara, also referred to as Tivradeva, is located near a Shiva temple and is about 1 km away from the Lakshmana temple. The temple is syncretic, built by a Shaiva king and his Buddhist queen, it shows Hindu and Buddhist themes. The monument is a syncretic collection of Buddhist and Hindu arts, as it shows along with Buddha statues and Buddhist artwork, Hindu themes such as Ganga and Yamuna goddesses, kama and mithuna scenes, Panchatantra tales as well as Gajalakshmi.Sirpur: The tantric trail, Bibek Bhattacharya, Outlook traveller (2014) Jain monuments One Jain basati and monastery ruins has been discovered near the river banks and about 100 meters from an 8th-century Shiva temple. A bronze image of Adinatha (Rishbha, the first Tirthankara) was found in the ruins, and the image is dated to the 9th century. ASI Museum A museum managed by Archaeological Survey of India in the Lakshmana temple premises preserves the artwork parts and pieces of archaeological ruins found during excavations in the 1950s and in the 2000s. These belong to Shaiva, Vaishnav, Buddha and Jain religions and variously dated to between 6th and 12th centuries.http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_tktd_chts_laxman.asp In popular culture In Ancient Aliens series of the History TV, Surang Tila has been mentioned to be made by extraterrestrial knowledge.

The petition is of importance as it eventually led to the admission of women as Fellows of the Society (one of the Societies that amalgamated to become the Royal Society of Chemistry), as well as identifying prominent female chemists working in Britain at this time.  Context  The Chemical Society was founded in 1841, but several attempts to allow the admission of women as fellows were unsuccessful. Attempts at change included a legal challenge based on the ambiguous language of the Society‚Äôs Charter in 1880, which was defeated because the issue of admitting women as fellows \\"was not expedient at the present time\\", followed by an attempt in 1892, defeated by a Council vote of 8 to 7. However, after the election of Marie Curie as a Foreign Fellow of the Society in 1904, 19 women signed a petition for admission of women as Fellows. The petition was organised by three of its signatories: Ida Smedley, Ida Freund, and Martha Whiteley.  Petition contents  The petition was addressed to the President and Council of the Chemical Society. It highlighted that in the previous thirty years that there were \\"about 150 women\\" who had appeared as authors on some 300 papers published by the Society. It listed the number of papers in the Journal of the Chemical Society in the periods 1873 - 1882 (20 papers), 1883 - 1892 (33 papers), 1893 - 1902 (142 papers), and 1903 to August 1904 (50 papers). They continue that as the Society deemed it fit to publish the work completed by female chemists, that they should help support this work by enabling \\"free access to chemical literature and by the right to attend the meetings of the Society\\".  Signatories  The signatories to the 1904 Petition are: # Lucy Boole # Katherine Alice Burke # Clare de Brereton Evans # Elizabeth Eleanor Field # Emily Fortey # Ida Freund # Mildred Gostling (Mrs Mills) # Hilda Hartle # Edith Humphrey # Dorothy Marshall # Margaret Seward (Mrs McKillop) # Ida Smedley (Mrs Maclean) # Alice Emily Smith # Millicent Taylor # M. Beatrice Thomas # Grace Toynbee (Mrs Frankland) # Martha Whiteley # Sibyl Widdows # Katherine Isabella Williams The network that allowed these women to co-sponsor the petition has been examined. Smedley, Freund, and Whiteley led the petition. Smedley attended the King Edward VI High School as did Thomas and Hartle. Freund was a demonstrator and a lecturer at Newnham College, Cambridge between 1887 and 1912, as were Elizabeth Eleanor Field, Dorothy Marshall, and Mildred Gostling. Thomas, Field, Whiteley, and Gostling spent time at Royal Holloway College, from where there were two additional petitioners: Margaret Seward and Sibyl Widdows. Clare de Brereton Evans and Millicent Taylor attended the Cheltenham Ladies' College, Cheltenham and Taylor had connections with the University of Bristol, where Emily Fortey and Katherine Williams studied. Lucy Boole studied at the London School of Medicine for Women and Katherine Burke studied at University College London under the supervision of William Ramsay - both of these women knew de Brereton Evans. Grace Toynbee studied at the University of Birmingham, and was possibly connected with Hartle. Two petitioners Edith Humphrey and Alice Smith have unknown connections to the remainder, but it is proposed that they were connected by male chemists keen to promote their cause, such William Ramsay.  Outcome  After the petition was received, William Tilden, the President of the Chemical Society in 1905, led agreement from Council that the Petition should be acted upon and that the Society's byelaws should be modified to give qualified women all the privileges of fellows, except for the power to hold office or vote at meetings. However, when this was put to a vote, only 45 fellows showed up, and the motion was defeated. The subsequent discussions led to an eventual compromise in 1908 that women be admissible as \\"Subscribers\\" which would allow attendance at ordinary meetings, the use of the library, and the receipt of Society publications. Only 11 women joined as \\"Subscriber\\" in the period 1908 - 1919, when the category was abolished. After World War I, at an extraordinary general meeting on 8 May 1919, the Society under its then President James Dobbie resolved that women should be admitted on the same terms as men, and the corresponding byelaw was passed in 1920. The first woman fellow admitted was Ida Smedley (Mrs Maclean).

He won notoriety as an opponent of the Enlightenment and of Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal, for which he spent eight years in prison. Biography Miguel Carlos da Cunha was the son of Tristan da Cunha de Ataide, Count of Povolide; his mother, Archangela Maria de Tavora, was the daughter of the Count of S. Vicente. Anuncia√ß√£o became a doctor of Canon Law (Coimbra, 1725), where he lectured in Canon Law and eventually was elected Rector. He became a member of the Congregation of Hermits of Saint Augustine (O.E.S.A.) at the monastery of Santa Cruz in 1728, and was elected Prior General of his Order in 1737. He was ordained a priest on 26 June 1729 by Luis Simoƒìs Brand√£o, Bishop of Angola.Rodrigues, p. 240. Anuncia√ß√£o was nominated Bishop of Coimbra by the King on 22 February 1739, and approved by Pope Benedict XIV on 19 December 1740.Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 172 with note 2. He was consecrated bishop on 9 April 1740, in the church of the monastery of Santa Cruz, by the Bishop of Angola, Valerio do Sacramento, O.E.S.A., assisted by the Bishop of Macao, Hilario de Santa Rosa, and the Bishop of Funchal, Jose do Nascimento.Rodrigues, p. 241. He made his entry into his diocese on 11 June 1740.Rodrigues, pp. 241-242. He founded the diocesan seminary of Coimbra in June 1741.Rodrigues, pp. 237-238; 243-244. On 8 November 1768 Anuncia√ß√£o issued a pastoral letter,Jos√© Eduardo Franco, \\"O 'terramoto' pombalino e a campanha de 'dejesuitza√ß√£o' de Portugal,\\" condemning a number of books of Enlightenment doctrine. Among these were the Encyclop√©die, works of Rousseau including the Social Contract, Justinus Febronius' De statu ecclesiae et legitima potestate Romani Pontificis, and Voltaire's La pucelle d'Orl√©ans.Rodrigues, p. 223. His attack ran diametrically opposite to the policy of Pombal, to modernize the educational system in Portugal to bring it into line with the more modern teaching of other institutions in Europe. The University of Coimbra's curriculum was more than two centuries out-of-date, and in some ways still medieval in character.Rodrigues, pp. 222-225. The bishop was arrested, imprisoned and deposed by the Marques de Pombal. He spent eight years imprisoned in the fortress of Pedrou√ßos. To break Anuncia√ß√£o's connection with the diocese he was given, against his will, and initially against the will of Pope Clement XIV, a coadjutor bishop, Francisco de Lemos de Faria Pereira Coutinho, a follower of Pombal, who was confirmed on 13 April 1774.Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 172 with note 3. This gave De Lemos canonical rights to govern the diocese during Anuncia√ß√£o's years in prison, and to succeed him on his death on 29 August 1777.Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 172, note 2.

She also published poetry, short stories, and creative nonfiction.  Biography   Early life and education  Tina DeRosa was born in Chicago, Illinois, on October 20, 1944, one of two children of Anthony DeRosa, a police officer, and Sophie (n√©e Norkus) DeRosa. She grew up in Chicago's Little Italy neighborhood, and attended Holy Guardian Angel Grammar School and St. Mary's High School. As a child, when she realized she could not be a priest or an altar boy, she decided to become a writer. She credited her father, who was artistic himself, with inspiring her. When she was 17, she and her family were displaced by urban renewal. Over the next four years, she lost her father and her paternal grandmother, an Italian immigrant. She channeled her feelings of grief and loss into her writing. DeRosa earned a bachelor's degree from Mundelein College in 1966, and a master's degree in English from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in 1977. She later said in an interview that she felt \\"completely lost\\" during her first two years at Mundelein, being one of only about three people from her neighborhood who went to college. At UIC, she taught composition classes while working on her master's thesis.  Career  After graduating from Mundelein, DeRosa worked briefly as a social worker. She took a secretarial job at the Chicago Tribune, and within three months was writing articles for the newspaper. DeRosa struggled for eight years, off and on, before completing her autobiographical novel, Paper Fish. Assisted by grants from the Illinois Arts Council and the National Endowment for the Arts, the novel was first published by Wine Press in 1980, and was nominated for the Carl Sandburg Award. An Italian-language edition, Pesci di Carta, was published in 2007. She was a writer in residence at the Ragdale Foundation from 1977 to 1982. She subsequently published two volumes of poetry and a biography of Bishop John Baptist Scalabrini, and wrote at least one more novel. Her writing has appeared in journals such as MELUS and Italian Americana, and in anthologies such as Helen Barolini's The Dream Book: An Anthology of Writings by Italian American Women (1985). In 1995 she won the Rona Jaffe Foundation Writers' Award. She earned her living at various jobs in the Chicago area, including communications director at the Urban Transportation Center of UIC and administrative assistant and editor for biomedical researchers.  Later years and legacy  During her final years, DeRosa lived in Park Ridge, Illinois. In 2005, she converted from Catholicism to the Greek Orthodox religion. She died on February 3, 2007, aged 62. DeRosa is often classified as an Italian-American writer, and Paper Fish in particular is considered an important work of Italian-American literature. DeRosa herself chafed at such labels: > All of the political stuff comes from the critics....I'm a writer who > happens to be a woman and happens to be Italian-American. I'm not a > feminist. I'm not an Italian-American writer. I'm just Tina and I'm just a > writer. Her papers are on file with the University of Illinois at Chicago library.

The house is located at 68 Bol'shaya Sadovaya street () at the intersection of Bol'shaya Sadovaya street and Semashko lane, directly opposite the Rostov-on-Don City hall. The building is also considered to be an object of cultural heritage. History The major Rostov merchant Stepan Fyodorovich Gench-Ogluev decided to build a revenue house. Accordingly, he invited architect Alexander Nikanorovich Pomerantsev. The construction of the building was begun in 1880 and was finished by 1883. It was the first Pomerantsev's work in Rostov-on-Don. Gench-Ogluev rented the house. On the ground floor were business premises. Dwellings and presence chamber were located over them. Priazovskiy kray (\\"Azov frontier\\") newspaper publishing house and the Volzhsko-Kamsky bank branch occupied the building in the early 20th century. The Gench-Ogluev House was nationalized in the 1920s after the establishment of the Soviet rule. In the 1920s rooms on the ground floor had been used as a South-Western Commercial corporate bank branch, Rostov-Neftsindikat district office, Myasokombinat butcher shop and other offices. Dwellings were on the first, 2nd and 3rd floor. Ryba fish store was opened in the building in the 1930s. The roof was destroyed during the Great Patriotic war. The house was restored according to a project of architect G. O. Kalayjan. The facade was refurbished with some changes. Brick dormer- windows appeared, reduced tower which in turn is topped by a seahorse sculpture was erected without spire. Several damaged balconies were not restored.  Description  The building was designed in the Beaux-Arts style. Architecture of the building employs Baroque, classic cornices, combined with a Gothic bas-relief on the pediments.

BBC 2009 DEC Gaza Appeal resignation  In January 2009, Niaz Alam resigned as an external member of the BBC's Appeals Advisory Committee (on which he had sat since June 2004,) during the controversy created by the BBC's refusal to broadcast a Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) appeal for humanitarian relief efforts in Gaza. His resignation came amid widespread criticism of the BBC's decision from across the political spectrum including from senior politicians such as Nick Clegg, Douglas Alexander and Hazel Blears and public figures like the Archbishops of York and Canterbury.The Guardian reported that the BBC faced a revolt from its journalists over the issue, and that they had been threatened with dismissal if they spoke out. Four days after the BBC's decision not to screen the appeal ITV, Channel 4 and Five broadcast the appeal intact on 26 January. The BBC also broadcast substantial extracts from the appeal in its TV news programmes. In his resignation letter, a version of which was published in Private Eye, Alam, while expressing support for the BBC as an institution, criticized its decision and objected to statements that gave the impression the whole of the appeals advisory committee had been party to the BBC's decision. His letter specifically defended the impartiality of the Disasters Emergency Committee recommendation to broadcast the appeal and disputed the logic of the then Director General's justification to block the appeal on grounds of impartiality, by pointing out that 'the ultimate logic of a policy of avoiding appeals arising out of politically controversial conflicts would be for the BBC to ignore major humanitarian crises.' Alam was interviewed on his resignation by journalist and broadcaster Peter Oborne for an edition of Channel 4's Dispatches. The BBC Trust reported in its 'Decision of the BBC Trust' document on the appeal that, 'the BBC Executive had received about 40,000 complaints about the Director General's decision'. The 2009 Gaza appeal is the only occasion on which the BBC is known to have refused an appeal broadcast request from the DEC. The 2009 DEC Gaza appeal screened only by Channel 4 and ITV raised ¬£8.3m. In August 2014, the BBC broadcast a new DEC aid appeal for people in Gaza, screened without similar controversy, which is reported to have raised ¬£16m over two years.

It is a grade II listed building. History The construction of the church, from local bricks, was funded by Enosh Durant (c1778-1848). It was consecrated on 1 November 1840 by Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London. Durant, who is commemorated by a monument placed in the church by his widow the year after his death, was the owner of a local brickworks, and lived at the High Canons estate in Shenley, near Borehamwood. The chancel was added in 1898 and was consecrated by the Bishop of St Albans, John Festing. The stained glass of the east window was installed in 1903. In 1921 a Lady Chapel was added and a war memorial was unveiled opposite the church in 1920. There are also memorials in the church to the fallen of both World Wars. St Peter's was originally built for the benefit of Durant's tenants and workers, but, after his death it became a chapel-of-ease of St John the Baptist Church, Chipping Barnet.

On 4 October 2017 a 11-man team of U.S. soldiers from the Army's 3rd Special Forces Group was operating with approximately 35 Forces Armees Nigeriennes (FAN) on a train and advise mission near Tongo Tongo. Militants, both Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and ISIS, had been using a nearby route to travel back and forth into Mali and back to a base camp in Niger and traffic in black market merchandise. The Nigerien forces were working to disrupt this so-called rat line and interdict the militants. While scouting the route, the group came under attack from more than 50 enemy fighters, riding in a dozen vehicles and on about 20 motorcycles, firing from numerous directions with small arms. Four Army Special Forces soldiers, five Nigerien soldiers and at least 21 ISGS militants were killed in the ambush. A further eight Nigerien and two US soldiers were wounded. Initially the US acknowledged only three killed, as the fourth soldier initially was missing; his body was found two days later at the location of the incident.

No group has taken responsibility for the killings, although officials commented that the US suspected a local branch of Islamic State was responsible, but without publicly naming any group.

Early career Charlton was born at Stranton near West Hartlepool to the landlord of the Blacksmith's Arms. Despite this birthplace, he would later come to consider himself \\"all but Yorkshire\\". He trained as a jockey with Bob Johnson in Middleham, then moved to a Mr. Armstrong in Richmond, and then to John Scott in Whitewall, where he completed his training. He rode trials for Scott, and began to race-ride, but the relationship was strained, and Charlton was dismissed from Scott's yard, with a companion, under suspicion that he had \\"got at\\" stable favourite Newminster, even though evidence for this is scant. The dismissal did not hold him back, and his first major successes came in 1853, when he won both the 1,000 Guineas on Mentmore Lass and the Doncaster Cup on Hungerford, both owned by Baron Meyer de Rothschild. Hungerford was Charlton's favourite horse, and as well as the Doncaster Cup, he also won the Northamptonshire Stakes and Great Yorkshire Handicap on it. He also rode the promising, but ultimately disappointing, Orestes. In 1854, he went very close to a Derby/Oaks double. He won the Oaks on Mincemeat, but could only make second in the Derby on King Tom, although it is suggested he might have won had the horse been fully fit. When in the south he rode for Rothschild, but while in the north he ended up riding for the I'Anson stable. In 1857, he had a dispute with Baron Rothschild, and took up a ride for William I'Anson ‚Äì Blink Bonny. Blink Bonny Blink Bonny was a bay filly, and though powerfully built and talented, she was unpopular with stable staff at I'Anson's yard at Hungerford House. For the 1,000 Guineas, she started as odds-on favourite, but was comprehensively beaten, and it was suspected she was short of work. Charlton was booked to ride her in the Derby at Epsom, for which she started at 20/1, in a field of 30. In a close finish, Blink Bonny won by a neck, and several professional punters lost heavily. Two days later, she started 4/5 favourite for the Oaks, and won much more easily, in the process becoming only the second horse after Eleanor to do the double. Following his Derby success, Charlton gave the whip he used to his father-in- law. Blink Bonny was then targeted at the final classic of the season, the St Leger. A large crowd was in attendance, including the writers Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins. Starting 5/4 favourite in a field of eleven, Blink Bonny could only finish fourth. Charlton had held her, preventing her from winning, on the orders of bookmaker John Jackson. This became evident when the next afternoon, Blink Bonny won the Park Hill Stakes over the same course and distance, carrying ten pounds more, by a distance of six lengths, and two seconds faster than Imperieuse, the St Leger winner, the previous day. This caused unrest in the crowd. In what came to be known as the \\"Blink Bonny Riot\\", Charlton was pulled from the horse and would have been assaulted by the mob without the intervention of former prize-fighters John Gully and Tom Sayers. Horse and jockey were eventually escorted from the course by an impromptu bodyguard of friends. Dickens wrote of the incident as \\"a violent scuffling and a rushing at the jockey, and an emergence of the said jockey from a swaying and menacing crowd, protected by friends, and looking the worse for wear.\\" Later life and death Charlton's finest riding feat came when winning the Goodwood Cup on Nancy, beating Alfred Day on Cossack by a head, in a fine display of horsemanship by both men. On Oaks day 1861, while waiting to ride Bonny Breast Knot, Charlton was persuaded by his medical advisor not to ride. Charlton reluctantly took heed, and his friend John Wells rode instead. Ultimately, Charlton's final ride was on Longshot at Malton on 23 May 1862, only a couple of months before his death. Charlton died of consumption at Hungerford House on 26 July 1862, aged only 33. Blink Bonny had died just a few months earlier when giving birth. He left effects of less than‚Ä≠ ‚Ä¨¬£1,000 and three months after his death, thieves broke into Hungerford House and took everything. He was survived by his wife Emmeline, the daughter of William Ewbank, who had horses in I'Anson's stables. Riding style Charlton was quiet of manner and disposition. He was not a showy or flash horseman, with few peculiarities by which he could be distinguished, although when he won the Ascot Gold Cup on Skirmisher, it was said that \\"seldom ...[had a race been] ridden in a prettier or more finished style\\". At his peak, he was able to ride at 7 stone.

The holding was sold at a significant profit in 2008. In 2011-2013 UCP completed a series of acquisitions of shares in the St Petersburg Exchange. In October 2013, UCP acquired a corporate pension fund from Norilsk Nickel. Later the pension fund was renamed ‚ÄòNPF Nasledie (Heritage)‚Äô and UCP concluded a partnership agreement with the Alor group of companies. Alor was also appointed manager of the pension fund.  Natural resources and infrastructure companies  As a result of three transactions with Novatek in 2007 and 2010, UCP sold three companies holding geological exploration licenses in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug. In 2008, UCP acquired the diamond producer, Severalmaz. The business was sold to Alrosa at the end of 2011. In June 2010, UCP acquired from the Integra group of companies a 100% stake in Uralmash-Drilling equipment (URBO), a producer of heavy drilling rigs. During the same year, UCP and Uralmash established a joint holding Uralmash-Drilling equipment (Uralmash NGO Holding), which included URBO and several drilling rig servicing companies. UCP increased its share in this joint venture to 85% in 2012. In April 2014, Gazprombank and UCP (on a parity basis) became owners of ‚Äî a large oil & gas contractor. Over several years prior to 2014, UCP built a 15.46% stake in which was later increased to 26.95% as a result of significant minority stake acquisition from Aton. According to media reports, in August 2015 UCP has sold its stake which then had a market value of 8.8 bn roubles. In 2015, UCP acquired a minority stake of 1.825% in Eurasia Drilling Company (EDC). In November 2015, controlling shareholders of the company conducted a buyout of minorities and delisted the company from the LSE. UCP and other minority shareholders considered that the buyback price was substantially below fair market value and filed a lawsuit in the Cayman courts against EDC. According to Kommersant, in July 2017 the parties signed a settlement agreement whereby the company agreed to pay a significant premium to the 2015 buyback price to UCP and other dissenting shareholders which ended the legal dispute.  Technology  In 2010, UCP acquired 5% in Monocrystal, one of the world‚Äôs leading manufacturers of synthetic sapphire for high-tech applications in electronics, optical devices and metallization pastes for solar cells. UCP increased its stake in 2011. In 2012, UCP exited the investment by selling its stake back to the founding shareholder.  Online Services  In April 2013, a consortium of investors led by UCP acquired a 48% stake in VK.com (VKontakte) from Vyacheslav Mirilashvili and Lev Leviev, co-founders of the social network. In August 2013, a dispute arose with Pavel Durov, another co-founder, CEO and 12% shareholder of VKontakte. UCP alleged that Durov had a conflict of interest as he had developed his own internet messenger, Telegram, using the resources of VKontakte and required him to transfer Telegram to VKontakte‚Äôs ownership. In December 2013, Durov sold his shares to , the then CEO of MegaFon (a subsidiary of USM Holdings), and in March 2014 Tavrin sold this stake to Mail.ru Group, another subsidiary of USM Holdings. Pavel Durov stepped down as CEO of VKontakte in April 2014. In September 2014, UCP sold its stake to Mail.Ru Group for $1.4 7bn while VKontakte as a whole was valued at $2.917 bn. As a result, Mail.Ru owned 100% of the social network, while UCP was reputed to have made a profit of $470-570 mln over the 17-month period. In December 2014, UCP invested in Russian start- up , an online on-demand service marketplace which matches users with independent household and business service providers. In July 2016, UCP, Flint Capital, and Sistema Venture Capital provided Youdo.com with a further $6.2M to finance geographical expansion.  Oil transportation and oil refining  Forbes magazine previously reported that, since 2011, UCP had been accumulating preferred shares of Transneft, the Russian oil pipeline monopoly. By mid-May 2016, UCP was the largest minority shareholder of Transneft. According to Forbes, as of May 2016, controlled Transneft stake with a total value of c. $1.3 bn. Later that year, UCP became involved in a legal dispute with Transneft management. UCP were demanding equal distribution of dividends for ordinary and preferred shares, that management should stop understating the profits and a full report on the company‚Äôs derivatives transactions which had caused multibillion-dollar losses for Transneft in 2014-2015. As a result of UCP‚Äôs shareholder activism, in December 2016 Transneft adopted a dividend policy setting dividend payouts at 25% of IFRS net income, i.e. substantially higher than historical payouts. In March 2017, in line with UCP‚Äôs demands, Transneft amended its charter to guarantee equal distribution of dividends to preferred and common shareholders. In March 2017, UCP sold 1.1 mln preferred shares for c.$3 bn to a group of financial investors.  Oil chemicals, oil refining, energy  In 2009-2011, UCP acquired a 24.99% stake in the petrochemical and oil refinery Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat. In May 2011, UCP exited the investment. In December 2015, UCP acquired a 9.7% stake in the utilities company Inter RAO from Norilsk Nickel for $152.6 mln. In March 2016, Inter RAO bought back from UCP 1.1% of its shares. In October 2016, UCP sold the remaining 8.6% for $497 mln. In October 2016, a consortium of investors, which included Trafigura, an international commodities trader, UCP and Essar signed a sales and purchase agreement to acquire a 49% stake in Essar Oil. Essar owns the second largest private oil refinery in India, an oil storage and port facility near the city of Vadinar, as well as a chain of more than 2,700 gas stations in India. Essar Oil was valued at $12.9 bn (including debt of $4.7 bn). Effective shares of UCP and Trafigura in EOL are 24% each. The transaction was completed in August 2017.  Owners and management  President and managing partner Ilya Sherbovich owns 77.7% of UCP Group of companies.

Lee Council by 1960), as well as the business and professional organizations described below.E. Griffith Dodson, The Virginia General Assembly 1940-1960 (Richmond:Virginia State Publication, 1961) p. 553 Career Not long after his admission to the Virginia bar in 1949, Lane began his public political career, as the Massive Resistance crisis in Virginia politics began. He was active in the local Democratic Party and the Jaycees, which gave Lane a distinguished service award in 1952. Voters first elected Lane to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1953, when he was 28, and re-elected him multiple times until he declined to seek re-election in 1977 but instead ran for Attorney General (and lost).http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:1952/year_to:1978/office_id:8/district_id:27336 Early in his legislative career, Lane became involved in the Potomac River Commission and served as chairman of the Educational Television Commission.Dodson p. 551 However, Lane was one of many members of a multi- member district, which eventually was numbered, but the number changed from District 60 in the 1962 election, to District 59 beginning in the 1964 election, and would become the 33rd during the 1970s.Virginia General Assembly 1960-1981, pp. 39-40 Redistricting occurred several times -- both due to U.S. federal census results, and as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court's adoption of one-man, one-vote requirements equalizing district size (which had varied greatly in Virginia before Reynolds v. Sims and Davis v. Mann), and eventually Virginia adopted single-member districts. Initially, Lane won election as one of seven members (all Democrats) representing Richmond in Virginia's House of Delegates. He served in the part-time position alongside fellow lawyer George E. Allen, Jr. for many years. During his initial term the other Richmond delegates included: W. Moscoe Huntley, Fred G. Pollard, W. Griffith Purcell, Eugene B. Sydnor Jr. and J. Randolph Tucker, Jr.. FitzGerald Bemiss soon replaced Sydnor, and in 1956 E. Tucker Carlton replaced Huntley. Then in 1958 Harold H. Dervishian and Thomas N. Parker Jr. replaced\`Purcell and Tucker, and in 1960 T. Coleman Andrews Jr. and David E. Satterfield III replaced Bemiss (who won election to the Virginia Senate) and Parker. In 1964, legislative redistricting combined Richmond with part of Henrico County as the 59th district and gained another seat. Thus, Junie L. Bradshaw, and Republicans Louis S. Herrink Jr. and S. Strother Smith Jr. joined the delegation as Satterfield and Parker left. Further changes came in 1966, as voters elected E. B. Pendleton, Jr., J. Sargeant Reynolds and T. Dix Sutton to the delegation, both Republicans failed to win re-election and Pollard won election as Lieutenant Governor of Virginia). Richmond's delegation changed further after the 1967 election, with Reynolds winning election to the Virginia Senate to replace Bemiss and only Lane and Allen remaining from the previous decade, and Junie L. Bradshaw and E.B. Pendleton Jr. were the only other veterans. Thomas P. Bryan, Ernst W. Farley Jr., William Ferguson Reid and former Richmond mayor Eleanor Parker Sheppard rounded out the Richmond delegation as the turbulent 1960s ended. In the 1970 legislative session, Carl E. Bain and B. Earl Dunn\`replaced Bryan and Pendleton in Richmond's delegation. After the reapportionment preceding the 1971 election, Richmond City only had five delegates: Lane, Allen, Bain, Sheppard and Philip B. Morris won the seats, although William Ferguson Reid was elected from a district encompassing Henrico County and Richmond City, and T. Dix Sutton, Robert B. Ball Sr. and Edwin H. Ragsdale represented Henrico County in another district. In 1974, Richmond City's delegation remained at 5 members, with Walter H. Emroch replacing Bain. The 1976 delegation included new members Franklin P. Hall and Richard S. Reynolds, as Emroch and Morris either left or failed to make the cut.Cynthia Miller Leonard, The Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) pp. 708, 713, 720, 726, 732, 738, 743, 749, 755, 762, 769, 776 A conservative, Lane had initially supported the Byrd Organization, guided by future governor Mills Godwin (the last member of the Byrd Organization to win that office, in 1973).

Bell. He previously served as the President of the Birmingham City School Board (2013‚Äì2015) and as an Assistant City Attorney for the City of Birmingham from 2009-2017. Early life and education Woodfin was born and raised in Birmingham's North Birmingham and Crestwood neighborhoods. He attended North Birmingham Elementary School, Putnam Middle School, and Shades Valley High School. Woodfin attended Morehouse College, where he majored in political science and served as president of Student Government Association. Woodfin went on to earn his J.D. degree from the Samford University Cumberland School of Law. Pre- mayorship Woodfin in October 2017. Between college and law school, Woodfin worked for the Birmingham City Council, the Mayor's Office Division of Youth Services, and the Jefferson County Committee on Economic Opportunity. Woodfin unsuccessfully ran for the Birmingham Board of Education's District 3 seat in 2009, placing third in a four-person race. In 2009, Woodfin became an assistant city attorney for the City of Birmingham, a position he held until being elected mayor in 2017. In 2013, Woodfin again ran for a seat on the school board, this time successfully. He was appointed president of the board two months after being elected; he held that position until 2015 and remained on the board until 2017. Woodfin has also served as a board member of other community organizations, including the Alabama Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, Birmingham Botanical Gardens, and the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama. He is a former board member of Birmingham Change Fund, American Red Cross, Birmingham Education Foundation, Birmingham Cultural Alliance, S.T.A.I.R., and past President of the Birmingham chapter of the Morehouse College Alumni Association. Woodfin is a graduate of Leadership Birmingham class of 2014, Leadership Alabama class of 2016, and served as a featured speaker at TEDx Birmingham 2017. Woodfin served as the Alabama state director for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. 2017 mayoral campaign Woodfin announced his run for Birmingham mayor in August 2016, challenging incumbent candidate William Bell along with 10 other candidates. In the general election, held on August 22, 2017, Woodfin won 40% of the vote, triggering a runoff election with Bell, who placed second. Woodfin won the October 3 runoff with 58.95% of the vote, becoming the city's youngest mayor in over 120 years. During the campaign, Woodfin criticized Bell's failure to improve Birmingham residents' quality of life and promised to focus his administration on revitalization of the city's 99 neighborhoods. Bell criticized Woodfin for receiving out-of-state contributions during the campaign; Woodfin argued that it was the only way to combat the incumbent candidate's sizable local donor base. Woodfin received support from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who recorded a robo-call telling voters that Woodfin would fight for Medicare for All. Our Revolution President Nina Turner visited Birmingham twice to campaign for Woodfin. Mayorship Woodfin speaks at a town hall meeting in January 2019. Woodfin promised throughout the campaign to conduct a forensic audit on city finances, but upon taking office instead conducted a performance audit. In March 2018, Woodfin's transition committee announced it had discovered that the city's pension fund had been consistently underfunded for more than 15 years, endangering the city's credit rating and retirement benefits for thousands of city employees. Woodfin increased funding to the pension fund by $2.9 million in the city's 2019 budget, and by $5.2 million in the city's 2020 budget ‚Äî which Woodfin's administration claimed fully met the city's obligation to the fund for the first time in more than a decade. Woodfin's administration has drawn criticism for a perceived lack of transparency, with AL.com columnist Kyle Whitmire calling Woodfin's attempts to block public information requests \\"stalling and stonewalling\\" and a violation of his campaign promises to increase transparency. Neighborhood Revitalization In his first two years in office, Woodfin budgeted $13 million for street resurfacing, $2.5 million toward clearing overgrown lots, and $6.5 million toward demolishing dilapidated structures. Woodfin has argued that his predecessor's policy regarding urban blight was \\"not as aggressive as it needed to be\\" and that it would be a \\"priority\\" for his administration. Crime Birmingham's high violent crime rate was a central plank of Woodfin's campaign platform; his nephew, Ralph Woodfin III, was shot and killed in August 2017, just weeks before the general election. Shortly after Woodfin took office in November 2017, Birmingham Police Department Chief A.C. Roper announced his resignation. After a lengthy search, Woodfin appointed former Los Angeles Police Department commander Patrick D. Smith to the position. In 2019, Woodfin's administration unveiled a public service announcement campaign titled \\"PEACE\\" featuring 30-second videos of mothers of gun violence victims telling their stories. The city's homicide rate has stayed approximately the same since Woodfin took office; the city logged 117 homicides in 2017, 110 in 2018, and 112 in 2019. Woodfin has maintained that total violent crime has dropped in the city during his tenure, and points to the police department's removal of thousands of guns from the streets. Several high-profile gun deaths ‚Äî high-schooler Courtlin Arrington, 4-year-old Jurnee Coleman, Kamille \\"Cupcake\\" McKinney, and Sgt. Wytasha Carter ‚Äî happened during Woodfin's first two years in office. Food Deserts One of Woodfin's early campaign promises was to address food deserts in the city. COVID-19 Along with the Birmingham City Council, Woodfin's administration passed a $15 million COVID-19 response plan in March 2020, allocating extra money for first responders' personal protective equipment, allocating overtime pay, and placing $1 million in a small business emergency loan fund. Woodfin also urged the council to pass a \\"shelter-in-place\\" ordinance on March 24, which has been extended through the end of April 2020. Confederate monuments Woodfin ordered the removal of the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument in Linn Park, Birmingham. The Alabama Attorney General has filed suit against the city of Birmingham for violating the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act. National politics Woodfin endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, despite having received Bernie Sanders' endorsement during his 2017 mayoral race. Woodfin cited Biden's ability to \\"make sure down-ballot candidates can win\\" as a primary reason for his endorsement. Woodfin was selected as one of seventeen speakers to jointly deliver the keynote address at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Political views Woodfin identifies as a political moderate. In a 2019 interview with The Root, Woodfin argued that \\"being a moderate does not equal status quo... I support a lot of things on the left but‚Äîif I‚Äôm being real‚ÄîI also believe you gotta win.\\" Woodfin has politically been compared to Jackson, Mississippi Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, another Our Revolution-backed candidate elected in 2017. Personal life Woodfin grew up with three siblings; his older brother Ralph was killed by gun violence in 2011. Woodfin's nephew Ralph Woodfin III was killed in August 2017. Woodfin is single and identifies as Christian. He attends Sixth Avenue Baptist Church in Birmingham. He is a fan of Mannie Fresh, Dr. Dre, The Neptunes, and Big K.R.I.T..

She married Joachim Daniel Preisler in 1779, which attracted great attention at the time because he was a member of the upper class and joined her profession after their marriage, highly unusual in an age when the stage professions where of low social status. Her spouse became an appreciated actor in lover roles, but the couple made a scandal with their spendthrift: in 1792, her husband fled the country, and four years later, she was placed under guardianship in order to sort out her financial affairs.

Early life Ittie Kinney Reno was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on May 17, 1862. She was the daughter of Col. George S. Kinney, of Nashville. She was a high-strung, imaginative child, remarkably bright and precocious, and while still very young she was sent to a convent in Kentucky, where she remained until her education was completed. She was graduated with first honors, and her valedictory was delivered in the form of an original poem. Her debut was marked by the brilliance that wealth and social influence confer, and soon she became one of the belles of Tennessee's capital. Career In the summer of 1889 she began to write a romance, entirely for self-amusement, with no thought of publication. She kept her work a secret till its completion, and then she laughingly gave it to her mother for criticism. Her parents insisted on publication, but R√©no declined. Finally her father won her consent to submit her manuscript to his friend, Hon. Henry Watterson, and to abide by his decision. Watterson read and pronounced it \\"a genuine southern love story, full of the fragrance of southern flowers and instinct with the rich, warm blood of southern youth.\\" He gave the young author some letters to eastern publishers, and her first novel, Miss Breckenridge, a Daughter of Dixie (Philadelphia, 1890), was published. It proved successful, and within a few months it had passed through five editions. Her second book, \\"An Exceptional Case\\" (Philadelphia, 1891), it also proved to be a success. In 1903 she won the second prize offered by the editor of the American Home Magazine, published in New York, in a story contest, in which magazine and newspaper writers in all parts of the country were competing. As a consequence, Reno was placed on the regular staff of contributors to the magazine. Her story was \\"Rattlesnake Jim\\". In 1908 she won the $500 offered as first prize in a story contest by Everybody's Magazine. In the contest 1.000 manuscripts were submitted. Personal life On May 21, 1885, she married Robert Ross R√©no of Harrisburger, Tennessee, only child of M. A. R√©no, Major of the Seventh United States Cavalry, famous for the gallant defense of his men during two days and nights of horror, from the overwhelming force of Sioux, who the day before had massacred Custer's entire battalion. Through his mother Robert Ross Reno was related to some of the oldest families in Pennsylvania. He was one of the heirs of Philippe Francois Renault (anglicized Reno), who arrived in Tennessee with Lafayette, and who left an estate valued at $200,000,000 ( $200,000,000 in 1893 are $5,183,398,623.61 in 2017). For several years after her marriage Reno led the life of a young woman of fashion and elegance. Reno lived in luxurious surroundings in a sumptuous home on Capitol Hill. She died on June 5, 1941, and is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery, Nashville.

Following a year of plunder in Syria, the Byzantine Emperor, Nikephoros II Phokas, decided to return to Constantinople for the winter. Before leaving, however, he constructed the Bagras Fort near Antioch and installed Michael Bourtzes as its commander, instructing him and Petros to lay siege to Antioch. Nikephoros explicitly forbade Bourtzes from taking Antioch by force in order to maintain the structural integrity of the city. Bourtzes, however, did not want to wait until winter to take the fortress. He also wanted to impress Nikephoros and earn himself glory, and so he entered into negotiations with the defenders seeking terms for surrender. At this point, Petros was engaged in a raid on the surrounding countryside with the Syrian commander 'Ay≈°al≈°, where he probably first entered into communications with Qarquya. Here it is possible that Bourtzes entered into an alliance with Aulax, the commander of the \\"Kallas\\" towers. Supposedly, Aulax, in exchange for gifts and prestige, assisted Bourtzes in transporting him, his commander Sachakios Brachamios, and 300 men on top of the Kallas towers during the night; upon ascending the towers, the Byzantines were able to gain a foothold in the outer defenses of the city. Bourtzes, now in control of the outer walls, sent a message to Petros recalling him to Antioch in order to take the city. At first, Petros was hesitant, remembering the emperor's orders not to take Antioch by force, but, as the requests from Bourtzes became more desperate and his men began to lose ground on the walls, he decided to return to Antioch to assist in taking the city. Petros approached the Kallas gates on 28 October, 969 and, upon witnessing his impending attack, the Antiochenes retreated and were defeated. Following the capture of Antioch, Bourtzes was removed from his position by Nikephoros due to his disobedience, and would go on to assist in a plot which would end in Nikephoros' assassination, while Petros would move deeper into Syrian territory, besieging and taking Aleppo itself and establishing the Byzantine Tributary of Aleppo through the Treaty of Safar.

It opened in 1849 to serve the docks which were expanding to the north of the city. History To cater for the increased freight traffic from the docks, Liverpool & Manchester Railway succeeded in gaining an Act of Parliament in 1845 to build the Waterloo branch. Work finally began on the line in 1845, by which point the Liverpool & Manchester Railway had been absorbed by the London & North Western Railway. The line was accessed via the Victoria and Waterloo tunnels. The station itself was completed and opened in 1849. During the Second World War, Liverpool and its docks were extensively targeted by German bombers and the station was hit. Despite being badly damaged, the station remained open though parts of its roofed sheds had to be demolished. By the 1950s the road network was taking more freight and use of the station began to decline leading to the station's eventual closure in 1963. The station was demolished in the early 1970s and is now the site of one of the ventilation shafts for the Kingsway Tunnel. Although the lines have been lifted the tunnels remain. In August 2016, the Great Howard Street bridge that spanned the lines was demolished to be replaced with a new one. This would allow the line to be brought back into use in the future to serve Liverpool Docks.
