The power station operated between 1956 and 1986 and supplied electricity to New South Wales. It was once the largest in the state. The 12,000 square-metre building was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The power station under construction In 1946, the New South Wales Government approved the construction of the power station on Lake Macquarie at Wangi Wangi by the New South Wales Government Railways. Wangi Wangi was chosen for its proximity to a large body of water and coalfields. The power station was officially opened on 7 November 1958 by the NSW Premier, Joseph Cahill, after ten years of construction and two years of progressive commissioning of the six turbo-alternators from C. A. Parsons and Company, which gave it a capacity of 330 MW. One thousand men camped in Wangi Wangi during the peak construction period. Wangi Power Station played an eminent part in relieving New South Wales of drastic power shortages during the late 1950s and playing a major role in restoring power supply to New South Wales after the total state power shutdown of 10 June 1964. Wangi Power Station was decommissioned in 1986, approximately thirty years after the first turbo- alternator commenced operation. The greater part of the generating equipment was removed by the early 1990s. While the generating equipment has been removed, the main buildings and emission stacks still stand as of 19 May 2019. The site has been subject to proposals for redevelopment into residential and retail properties since the 1990s. = 'A' Station - 150 MW = Wangi 'A' Station consisted of three 50 MW Parsons turbo-alternators. Steam was supplied at 650PSI and 840degF from six spreader-stoker coal-fired Babcock & Wilcox (UK) (now Babcock International) cross drum boilers. The firing system consisted of the Spreader Stoker and Babcock & Wilcox Detroit Rotograte. Rapidly rotating blades of the spreader feeder unit flung coal of the required size onto the rotograte, with a large percentage igniting before landing on the grate. The amount of coal feed could be regulated by varying the length of the stroke of the pusher plate supplying fuel to the coal feeder. There were two rotogrates fitted which consisted of two endless chains carrying transverse grate bars in a revolving action. Eight coal feeder units controlled through Reeves variable speed control drive. Each boiler had an output of 180,000 lb/h. It was a project of New South Wales Government Railways, but control was transferred before its completion to the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, which was formed in 1950. = 'B' Station - 180 MW = The later 'B' Station, a modified product of the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, had three 60 MW Parsons units. Steam was supplied by 3 Babcock & Wilcox boilers that burnt pulverised coal. Steam pressure was 950PSI and steam temperature was 950 deg F. It was unit type plant and each boiler supplied 550,000 lb/h of steam to one turbine only. To reduce visible emissions, the electrostatic precipitators of 'A' Station were upgraded to shaker-type fabric filters, and those of 'B' Station were upgraded to high pressure pulse jet bag filters, in 1976. The shaker-type fabric or bag filter has since become a standard feature of power stations in New South Wales.  Heritage listing  The Wangi Power Station has highest level State heritage Significance for its association with leading the evolution of coalfields - sited power stations and power generation in New South Wales. It has similar level significance for being the largest power station in NSW for at least its first five years of operation. Its pre-eminent part in relieving NSW from the drastic power shortages and blackouts during the late 1950s and playing major roles in restoring power supply to NSW after the total state power shutdown of 10 June 1964. Wangi Power Station was the last of the Railway's power stations to be built, and the last one to close, and represents the transition from Railways to Elcom as the predominant power generation authority in NSW.Wangi Power Station: Conservation Management Plan by EJE Architecture, Jan 2000 Wangi Power Station Complex was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Wangi Power Station has highest level State significance being: aesthetically distinctive, showing creating and technical innovation, associated with the creative accomplishments of an eminent Architect and for continuing to act as a prime exemplar of a particular style of Architectural expression. Wangi Power Station is significant for its intended position as the \\"showpiece\\" of power generation in the state. Its position as a show piece was evidenced by the excellence of its architectural design, by the high quality of workmanship in the brick cladding, and in the outstanding appearance and quality of design and materials used. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Wangi Power Station has regional social significance. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Wangi Power station has state level technical significance because it has unique potential to reveal worthwhile historical and scientific information unavailable elsewhere and it is a major reference in the state. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Wangi Power Station is significant as a rare example in Australia of industrial architecture. The building is significant for its rarity as a modern power station designed and built with its architectural appearance, as an integral part of its landscape and environment to the forefront of its design parametres, rather than using purely technological and economic factors to dictate the design. Wangi Power Station is one of the last major buildings in Australia to have a structural frame of riveted steel. Further it is significant for its construction method, which incorporated an early use of the \\"fast tracking idea\\", whereby one end of the building was in full production before the other was fully erected.

Salt and pepper shakers are sometimes held in a cruet-stand. History and usage Salt and pepper shakers can be made from a variety of materials, including plastic, glass, metal, and ceramic.Longenecker, E. Z. (1970) \\"Using the Slush Casting Method to Make Salt and Pepper Shakers.\\" School Shop. 29(6) p. 56. Salt shakers became increasingly common after anti- caking agents were introduced by the Morton Salt company in the 1920s. The Great Depression of the 1930s boosted the popularity of salt and pepper shakers as global ceramics producers concentrated on inexpensive items. Except in the most casual dining establishments, they are usually provided as a matched set, sometimes distinguishable only by the number of holes on the top of the shaker. Designs range from small, plain glass screw cap containers (invented by John Landis Mason, inventor of the Mason jar) to more ornate works of art. Sometimes the design refers to some pair of related objects‚Äîsuch as a replica of a West Highland White Terrier containing salt and a Scottish Terrier containing pepper. Designs may also relate to specific occasions or holidays. As a result of this diversity of design, collecting salt and pepper shakers is a hobby.The Complete Salt and Pepper Shaker Book, Mike Schneider, Schiffer Publishing (1993), , Florence's Big Book of Salt & Pepper Shakers: Identification & Value Guide, Gene Florence, Collector Books (2002), , Collecting Salt & Pepper Shaker Series, Irene Thornburg, Schiffer Publishing (1998), , Salt & Pepper Shakers IV: Identification & Values, Helene Guarnaccia, Collector Books (1993), , 1002 Salt and Pepper Shakers: With Prices, Larry Carey and Sylvia Tompkins, Schiffer Publishing (1995), , Collector's Encyclopedia of Salt and Pepper Shakers: Second Series (Figural and Novelty 2nd Series), Melva Davern, Collector Books (1990), , Design of salt and pepper shakers has also been used to transmit cultural perspectives about raceHolt, T.

There are two Museums of Salt and Pepper Shakers dedicated to showing the variety and history of salt and pepper shakers through the ages.  Distinguishing salt from pepper  The number of holes varies by culture, health and taste. In the United States where excessive salt is considered unhealthy, salt is stored in the shaker with the fewer holes, but in parts of Europe where pepper was historically a rare spice, this is reversed. In the UK, salt was often poured onto the side of one's plate and used for dipping, rather than shaken across the whole dish, hence salt cellars having a single, larger, hole. As an alternative to salt and pepper shakers, pepper may be distributed at the table by use of a pepper grinder, while salt may be distributed from a salt cellar or a salt mill.

Comdr. J. Huling in command.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  Following shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay, Allegan took on a cargo of pontoons at Davisville, Rhode Island, for transportation to the Philippines. She left Davisville on 19 October and shaped a course for the Pacific Ocean. The ship transited the Panama Canal on the 30th and continued sailing westward. She reached Eniwetok on 27 November and departed that atoll on 6 December in a convoy bound for Leyte. The vessel paused en route at Ulithi before reaching Leyte on 22 December. = Carrying pontoons to the Philippines = Allegan operated in Philippine waters in and Samar through late January 1945, discharging cargo and assembling pontoons. She successfully carried out this assignment despite being subjected to frequent enemy air attacks. The ship left the Philippines on 23 January and shaped a course for the west coast of the United States. She paused en route at Manus, Admiralty Islands, on 30 January; then sailed on for California and reached San Pedro, California, on 23 February. There, she took on board another cargo of pontoons and got underway again on 9 March bound for Okinawa. = Delivering pontoons to Okinawa = After making brief port calls at Eniwetok and Ulithi, the vessel arrived off Okinawa on 3 May. During the next three months, she remained in the area discharging and assembling pontoons. She was subjected to frequent air attacks throughout this period and assisted in downing three enemy planes. = End-of-war activity = Allegan departed Okinawa on 5 August, bound for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, via Saipan. She arrived in Hawaiian waters on 26 August, and stood out two days later for San Francisco, California. The vessel reached San Francisco Bay on 5 September and, after a period of voyage repairs, got underway again on 6 October bound for Hampton Roads, Virginia. After retransiting the Panama Canal, Allegan reached Norfolk, Virginia, on 27 October.  Post-war decommissioning  She was decommissioned at Portsmouth, Virginia, on 15 November 1945; was returned to the War Shipping Administration a week later, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 28 November 1945.

The company shipped multiple processors, including the TILE64, TILEPro64, and the TILEPro36, TILE-Gx72, TILE-Gx36, TILE-Gx16 and TILE-Gx9. After a series of company acquisitions. Tilera's intellectual property was eventually acquired by Mellanox, which now ships products that descend from the original Tilera designs.  History  In 1990, Anant Agarwal led a team of researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop scalable multi-processor system built out of large numbers of single chip processors. Alewife machines integrated both shared memory and user-level message passing for inter-node communications. In 1997, Agarwal proposed a follow-on project using a mesh technology to connect multiple cores. The follow-on project, named RAW, commenced in 1997, and was supported by DARPA/NSF's funding of tens of millions, resulting in the first 16-processor tiles multicore and proving the mesh and compiler technology. Tilera was founded in October 2004, by Agarwal, Devesh Garg, and Vijay K. Aggarwal. Tilera launched its first product, the 64-core TILE64 processor, in August 2007. Tilera raised more than $100 million in venture funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, Walden International, Columbia Capital and VentureTech Alliance, with strategic investments from Broadcom, Quanta Computer and NTT. The company was headquartered in San Jose, California and operated a research and development facility in Westborough, Massachusetts, USA. It had Sales and Support Centers in Shenzhen China, Yokohama Japan, and Europe. In July 2014, Tilera was acquired by EZchip Semiconductor, a company that develops high- performance multi-core network processors, for $130 million in cash.EZchip to Buy Tilera EZchip was later acquired by Mellanox Technologies.  Products  Tilera's primary product family was the Tile CPU. Tile is a multicore design, with the cores communicating via a new mesh architecture, called iMesh, intended to scale to hundreds of cores on a single chip. The goal was to provide a high-performance CPU, with good power efficiency, and with greater flexibility than special-purpose processors such as DSPs. In October 2009, the company announced a new chip family TILE-Gx based on 40 nm technology that features up to 72 cores at 1.2 GHz. Other TILE-Gx family members include 9-, 16-, 36-core variants. Their markets for this product announced in October 2011, included: * Cloud computing applications such as web indexing, search engine and cache acceleration servers * Networking equipment including intelligent routers, firewalls, network test equipment, and forensic / data- mining applications * Multimedia applications such as videoconferencing, broadcast video servers, and edge QAM systems * Wireless infrastructure such as 4G Node B Base Station, RNC, and media gateways The 36-core general purpose CPU consumes approximately 35 watts at full load. In October 2010, version 2.6.36 of the mainline Linux kernel added support for the Tilera architecture.\\"1.1. Tilera architecture support\\", Linux 2.6.36 Release Notes Tilera also provided software development tools called the Multicore Development Environment (MDE) for Tile, and a line of boards built around the Tile processors. The networking software company 6WIND provided high- performance packet processing software for the TilePro64 platform.http://www.6wind.com/wp-content/uploads/PDF/press/2011/6WIND- announces-availability-of-Tilera-TilePro64-support.pdf On 25 July 2011, TilePro processor was found by Facebook to be three times more energy- efficient than Intel's x86, based on Facebook's experiments on servers using TilePro processor and Intel's x86. In November 2012, MikroTik became the first manufacturer to ship devices based on the Tile-GX processors, the product line is called Cloud Core Router.http://cloudcorerouter.com Cloud Core Router product page As of June 2018, the Linux kernel has dropped support for this architecture.

The term oleuropein is derived from the botanical name of the olive tree, Olea europaea. Because of its bitter taste, oleuropein must be completely removed or decomposed to make olives edible. During processing of bitter and inedible green olives for consumption as table olives, oleuropein is removed from olives via a number of methods, including by immersion in lye. Chemical treatment Oleuropein consists of a molecule of elenolic acid linked to the orthodiphenol hydroxytyrosol by an ester bond, and to a molecule of glucose by a glycosidic bond. Alkaline conditions favor the elimination, or directly the decomposition, of oleuropein from the tissues of fresh green olives immersed in a lye solution. Two mechanisms occur simultaneously: first, at high pH (~ 13.9) in a 3 wt. % NaOH solution, most of the phenolic groups (pKa ‚âà 10) present in the oleuropein molecule are deprotonated and present in a dissociated state. The ionized phenolate groups significantly increase the solubility of the molecule in the tissue of the olives. The oleuropein can then more easily diffuse out of the fruits and is released into the lye solution. Second, under alkaline conditions, the oleuropein molecule is chemically hydrolyzed into hydroxytyrosol and elenolic acid by the breakdown of the ester and glycosidic bonds. At high pH, as phenols and polyphenols, the molecule is sensitive to oxidation and can degrade faster, while olives turn black as during their normal ripening, if the solution is oxygenated by air injection (alkaline oxidation of olives also called the California process). The lye solution is replaced several times by a fresh one until the bitter taste has completely disappeared. An alternative process uses an amberlite macroporous resins to trap the oleuropein molecule directly from the solution, giving the advantage to reduce waste water while capturing the extracted molecules. Enzymatic hydrolysis during the maturation of olives is also an important process for the decomposition of oleuropein and elimination of its bitter taste. Green olive blackening Green olives may be treated industrially with ferrous gluconate (0.4 wt. %) to change their color to black. Gluconate, an edible oxidation product of glucose, is used as non-toxic reactant to maintain Fe2+ in solution. When in contact with polyphenols, the ferrous ions form a black complex, giving the final color of the treated olives. Black olives treated with iron(II) gluconate are also depleted in hydroxytyrosol, as iron salts are catalysts for its oxidation.  Research  Oleuropein has been proposed as a proteasome activator.

Wickrama Bogoda and Anula Karunathilaka acted the lead roles of Sugath and Dhammhi. The movie's story is built on the novel Golu Hadawatha written by Karunasena Jayalath in 1962, based on his school time experiences and memories. Regi Siriwardena wrote the screenplay and Veteran Sinhala musician Premasiri Khemadasa composed the music. Golu Hadawatha is acclaimed as a movie that set a milestone in Sinhala moviemaking. It introduced a new cinematic format to the romance and love movie genre. The movie departs from the then traditional movie style; no hero, heroine, (\\"Boy\\" and \\"Girl\\") no enemy or villain, Joker, no songs, and fights etc. Based on a romantic and emotional attachment between a teenage boy and a girl who study in the same class of their school, Golu Hadawatha is regarded as one of the landmarks in Sri Lankan Cinema. It was awarded the Best Film, Best Director and Best Actress of the year at the prestigious Sarasaviya Awards Festival. The film, which depicts the love affair between two school going teenagers, created a sensation among Sri Lankan film lovers, both young and old, and is considered a landmark in the history of Sri Lankan cinema. The original script was being written by Piyasiri Gunaratne and Karunasena Jayalath. Before being finished, Piyasiri Gunaratna casually mentioned he was working on the script to Lester James Peiris. A few weeks later, the newspapers announced Lester James Peiris was about to shoot the film. It came out that Mr. Pieris took advantage of the situation, took over the script from Karunasena Jayalath and so de facto stole the script as well as the film from Piyasiri Gunaratne.  Plot  The first half of the film depicts the story through the eyes of Sugath and the next half the audience see the story through the eyes of Dhammi. Damayanthi \\"Dhammi\\" Kariyawasam (Anula Karunathilaka) is a mischievous school girl. Sugath Weerasekara (Wickrama Bogoda) is a shy and introverted boy who is new to Dhammi's school. He is quiet and gifted at schoolwork. Dhammi is immediately attracted to him and they become friends. The friendship eventually develops into a special relationship. Sugath, who has lost his parents when he was very young, has a brother who is attending university. He tells his brother, Sarath (Wijeratne Warakagoda) about his relationship with Dhammi. On the day of the final exam, Dhammi tells Sugath not to keep any further hopes about her. Sugath is heartbroken and comes home to meet Sarath. In the meantime, he passes his exams with flying colors and Sarath marries Champa (Sriyani Amarasena), who is willing to accept Sugath as her own brother. But Sugath is unable to forget Dhammi, and keeps thinking about her and begins to drink heavily to alleviate his pain. He also loses his job as a teacher and leaves the home he shares with his brother's family. One day, Dhammi comes to meet Sugath and reveals the secret for her sudden change. She tells Sugath that she loved him despite knowing that she would never have the chance to become his wife. She begs for forgiveness from him for playing with his feelings and asks him to change for her sake. Dejected, Sugath returns home, broken-hearted.

It is located on Easley Bridge Road off U.S. Route 231, just south of the town of Rosa, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) northwest of Oneonta. Coordinates are (33.971144, -86.518719). Built in 1927, the 95-foot (29-meter) bridge is a town lattice truss construction over a single span. Its WGCB number is 01-05-12. The Easley Covered Bridge was listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on March 3, 1976. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 20, 1981. It is currently the oldest and shortest of three historic covered bridges still existing in Blount County. The bridge which had been closed in 2009 has now been restored and reopened to motor vehicle traffic on October 22, 2012. It is accessible from both sides of Easley Bridge Road. It is maintained by the Blount County Commission and the Alabama Department of Transportation. History The Easley Covered Bridge was built by a crew led by foreman Forrest Tidwell and his nephew Zelma C. Tidwell in 1927 over Dub Branch. Other than occasional repair work, the bridge had been in continuous use since it was constructed. After a routine inspection, the Easley Covered Bridge was closed in 2009 due to unsafe conditions along with nearby Swann Covered Bridge. The Horton Mill Covered Bridge was already closed as a result of vandalism which occurred in 2007. Restoration of all three bridges began in late 2011. Money for these projects primarily came from the federal National Historic Covered Bridge Preservation Program as well as transportation enhancement funds. The $469,110 construction contract was awarded to Bob Smith Construction of Trussville, Alabama. The Easley Covered Bridge would be the second of the three to be restored. Wooden structural pieces were repaired or replaced as needed and new tin roofs were put on all three bridges in order to keep the weather off vital supporting timbers. Total restoration costs for the covered bridges was approximately $540,000. The difference was covered by county expenditures. Following necessary repairs and upgrades, the Easley Covered Bridge was reopened to motor vehicle traffic on October 22, 2012. In late 2015, cameras were installed at the three remaining covered bridges in Blount County to help deter vandalism after graffiti was found on the Easley Covered Bridge a year earlier.ABC Channel 33/40, Cameras installed at 3 Blount County covered bridges by Alisa Long, October 5, 2015, Retrieved Jan. 30, 2016.

Specimens are also known to grow on flat, paved limestone; B. nana is known from only in two populations, confined to an area of less than 20 km¬≤ in the northeastern part of the island. It is possible that Boswellia nana is a natural hybrid between B. socotrana and another Boswellia species (though which other species is, as yet, unknown). Some evidence for this is found in a solitary Boswellia tree discovered growing at the bottom of limestone cliffs at Hamadero; it displays some characteristics of both B. nana and B. socotrana. Furthermore, this tree is growing in an area that lies ecologically in between the habitats of both species, sharing certain qualities. However, B. nana was thought (by botanists Mats Thulin and Abdul Nasser Al-Gifri, in 1998) to be a smaller form of Boswellia popoviana.

It includes part of Brazil and Bolivia, along the rivers Madeira, Mamor√© and Guapor√©, near which the Madeira-Mamor√© Railroad was built. The Amazon Rubber Boom ( , 1879 to 1912) was an important part of the economic and social history of Brazil and Amazonian regions of neighboring countries, being related to the extraction and commercialization of rubber. Centered in the Amazon Basin, the boom resulted in a large expansion of European colonization in the area, attracting immigrant workers, generating wealth, causing cultural and social transformations, and wreaking havoc upon indigenous societies. It encouraged the growth of cities such as Manaus and Bel√©m, capitals within the respective Brazilian states of Amazonas and Par√°, among many other cities throughout the region like Itacoatiara, Rio Branco, Eirunep√©, Marab√°, Cruzeiro do Sul and Altamira; as well as the expansion of Iquitos in Peru and Cobija in Bolivia. The rubber boom occurred largely between 1879 and 1912. There was heightened rubber production and associated activities again from 1942 to 1945 during the Second World War. Background Extraction of latex from a rubber tree. Natural rubber is an elastomer, also known as tree gum, India rubber, and caoutchouc, which comes from the rubber tree in tropical regions. Christopher Columbus was the one of the first Europeans to bring news of this odd substance back to Europe, but he was not the only one to report it. Around 1736, a French astronomer recalled how Amerindians used rubber to waterproof shoes and cloaks. He brought several samples of rubber back to France. Rubber was used as an eraser by scientist Joseph Priestley in England. It was not until the 1800s that practical uses of rubber were developed and the demand for rubber began. A rubber factory that made rubber garters for women opened in Paris, France, in the year 1803. However, the material still had disadvantages: at room temperature, it was sticky. At higher temperatures, the rubber became softer and stickier, while at lower temperatures it became hard and rigid. The South Amerindians first discovered rubber; sometime dating back to 1600BC. The Amerindians in the Amazon rainforest developed ways to extract rubber from the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), a member of the family Euphorbiaceae. A white liquid called latex is extracted from the stem of the rubber tree, and contains rubber particles dispersed in an aqueous serum. The rubber, which constitutes about 35% of the latex, is chemically cis-1,4-polyisoprene ((C5H8)n). Latex is practically a neutral substance, with a pH of 7.0 to 7.2. However, when it is exposed to the air for 12 to 24 hours, its pH falls and it spontaneously coagulates to form a solid mass of rubber. Rubber produced in this fashion has disadvantages. For example, exposure to air causes it to mix with various materials, which is perceptible and can cause rot, as well as a temperature-dependent stickiness. Industrial treatment was developed to remove the impurities and vulcanize the rubber, a process that eliminated its undesirable qualities. This process gives it superior mechanical properties, and causes it to lose its sticky character, and become stable - resistant to solvents and variations in temperature. Effects on indigenous population A photo of enslaved Amazon Indians from the 1912 book \\"The Putumayo, the Devil's Paradise\\" The rubber boom and the associated need for a large workforce had a significant negative effect on the indigenous population across Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. As rubber plantations grew, labor shortages increased. The owners of the plantations or rubber barons were rich, but those who collected the rubber made very little as a large amount of rubber was needed to be profitable. The rubber barons rounded up all the Indians and forced them to tap rubber out of the trees. One plantation started with 50,000 Indians but, when discovered, only 8,000 were still alive. Slavery and systematic brutality were widespread, and in some areas, 90% of the Indian population was wiped out. These rubber plantations were part of the Brazilian rubber market, which declined as rubber plantations in Southeast Asia became more effective.Why do they hide?, Survival International: Roger Casement, an Irishman traveling the Putumayo region of Peru as a British consul from 1910 to 1911, documented the abuse, slavery, murder and use of stocks for torture against the native Indians: Survival International: Horrific treatment of Amazon Indians exposed 100 years ago today > \\"The crimes charged against many men now in the employ of the Peruvian > Amazon Company are of the most atrocious kind, including murder, violation, > and constant flogging.\\" According to Wade Davis, author of One River: > \\"The horrendous atrocities that were unleashed on the Indian people of the > Amazon during the height of the rubber boom were like nothing that had been > seen since the first days of the Spanish Conquest.\\" Rubber had catastrophic effects in parts of Upper Amazonia, but its impact should not be exaggerated nor extrapolated to the whole region. The Putumayo was a particularly horrific case. Many nearby rubber regions were not ruled by physical violence, but by the voluntary compliance implicit in patron-peon relations. Some native peoples benefited financially from their dealings with the white merchants. Others chose not to participate in the rubber business and stayed away from the main rivers. Because tappers worked in near complete isolation, they were not burdened by overseers and timetables. In Brazil (and probably elsewhere) tappers could, and did, adulterate rubber cargoes, by adding sand and flour to the rubber \\"balls\\", before sending them downriver. Flight into the thicket was a successful survival strategy and, because Indians were engaged in credit relations, it was a relatively common practice to vanish and work for other patrons, leaving debts unpaid. First rubber boom, 1879‚Äì1912 Commercial center of Manaus in 1904. Commercial area of Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, 1906. Processing of rubber, Manaus, 1906. For the first four and a half centuries following the discovery of the New World, the native populations of the Amazon Basin lived practically in isolation. The area was vast and impenetrable, no gold or precious stones had been found there, as neither colonial Brazil nor imperial Brazil was able to create incentives for development in the region. The regional economy was based on use of diverse natural resources in the region, but development was concentrated in coastal areas. =Rubber: sure wealth= The Industrial Revolution in Europe led to demand for uses that natural rubber could satisfy. At that time, it was exclusively found in the Amazon Basin. It was a desirable commodity, valued at a high price, and thought to create wealth and dividends for whoever would dare invest in the trade. From the beginning of the second half of the 19th century, rubber began to exert a strong attraction to visionary entrepreneurs. The activity of latex extraction in the Amazon revealed its lucrative possibilities. Natural rubber soon achieved a place of distinction in the industries of Europe and North America, reaching a high price. This caused various people to travel to Brazil with the intention of learning more about the rubber tree and the process of latex extraction, from which they hoped to make their fortunes. Because of the growth of rubber extraction, industrial processing and related activities, numerous cities and towns swelled on waves of immigrants. In 1855, over 2,100 tons of rubber was exported from the Amazon; a figure which reached 10,000 tons by 1879. Bel√©m and Manaus were transformed and urbanized. Manaus was the first Brazilian city to be urbanized and the second to be electrified (the first was Campos dos Goytacazes, in Rio de Janeiro). =Development of railroads= The rubber boom justified the construction of the Madeira Mamor√© Railroad Developers in Bolivia in 1846 began to promote the idea of constructing a railroad along the Madeira and Mamor√© Rivers, in order to reach ports on the Atlantic Ocean for its export products. Its territory did not reach the coast. Rivers had long been the key to navigation and travel through the Amazon Basin. An initial proposal was based on travel up the Mamor√© in Bolivia and down the Madeira River in Brazil. But, the river course had substantial obstacles to industrial-level transport: twenty cataracts obstructed navigation. Constructing a railroad to bypass the problematic stretches of the rivers was the only solution. In 1867, in Brazil, also trying to develop a simple way to transport the rubber, the engineers Jos√© and Francisco Keller organized a large expedition. They explored the rubber region of the Madeira River to find the most productive region and the most effective course for the railroad. Although the idea of river navigation was complicated, in 1869, the North American engineer George Earl Church obtained from the Bolivian government a concession to create and explore a navigation enterprise that linked the Mamor√© and Madeira Rivers. Shortly afterwards, he realized the real difficulty of this undertaking. He changed the plans to construction of a railroad. Negotiations advanced and, by 1870, Church received permission from the Brazilian government to build a railroad along the rubber territories of the Madeira River. =Acre question= The territory of Acre state in modern Brazil The increase in uncontrolled extraction of rubber was increasing tensions and close to provoking an international conflict. The Brazilian workers advanced further and further into the forests in the territory of Bolivia in search of new rubber trees for extraction, creating conflicts and skirmishes on the frontier towards the end of the 19th century. The Bolivian Army, led by Jos√© Pl√°cido de Castro, was sent into the area to protect Bolivian resources. The newly proclaimed Brazilian republic was drawing a considerable profit from the lucrative rubber trade, but the \\"Acre question\\" (as the border conflicts caused by rubber extraction became known) preoccupied it. Intervention by the diplomat Bar√£o do Rio Branco and the ambassador Joaquim Francisco de Assis Brasil, in part financed by the \\"rubber barons,\\" led to negotiations with Bolivia and the signing of the Treaty of Petropolis, signed November 17, 1903, during the government of president Francisco de Paula Rodrigues Alves. While it halted conflict with Bolivia, the treaty guaranteed effective control by Brazil of the forests of Acre. Brazil was given possession of the region by Bolivia in exchange for territories in Mato Grosso, a payment of two million pounds sterling, and the compromise of constructing the railroad to connect to the Madeira River. This would enable Bolivia to transport its goods, primarily rubber, to the Brazilian ports of the Atlantic at the mouth of the Amazon River. Initially Bel√©m in Par√° was designated as the destination. Because of the peaceful resolution of this issue, the capital of Acre was named Rio Branco after the Brazilian diplomat. Two of the municipalities in the state were named Assis Brasil and Pl√°cido de Castro, after the ambassador and another key figure. =Madeira-Mamor√© Railroad= The Madeira-Mamor√© Railroad became known as the \\"Devil's Railroad\\" on account of having caused the death of around six thousand workers (in legends said to be one dead worker per railroad tie attached to the rails) was constructed by the United States corporation of Percival Farquhar. The construction of the railroad began in 1907 during the government of Afonso Pena and was one of the most significant episodes in the history of the occupation of the Amazon, revealing the clear attempt to integrate it into the global marketplace via the commercialization of rubber. On April 30, 1912, the final stretch of the Madeira-Mamor√© Railroad was completed. The occasion was commemorated by the arrival of the first train to the city of Guajar√°-Mirim, founded on that same day. First, the price of latex fell precipitously in the world market, making the trade of rubber from the Amazon unviable. Also, the transport of products that could have been transported by the Madeira-Mamor√© Railroad were taken by two other railroads, one in Chile and the other in Argentina, and the Panama Canal, which became active on August 15, 1914. Added to this, the natural factor, the Amazon forest, with its high level of rainfall and rapid growth, destroyed entire stretches of the rails, leveled ground, and bridges, reclaiming a large part of the way that people had insisted on clearing to construct the railroad. The railroad was partially taken out of service in the 1930s and completely in 1972 That year the Trans-Amazonian highway (BR-230) opened. Today, from a total of 364 km of length of railway, about seven remain in active use, used for tourist purposes. The people of Rondonia have fought for revitalization of the railroad, but as of December 1, 2006, the work remains unstarted. =Apogee, elegance, and luxury= Amazon Theatre in Manaus, one of the luxurious buildings built with rubber fortunes. Bel√©m, the capital of Par√° state, as well as Manaus, the capital of Amazonas, were the most developed and prosperous cities in Brazil during the rubber boom. They were located in strategic sites, and prominent men in the rubber industry built their numerous and wealthy residences in each. These citizens created the demand that led to both cities being electrified and given running water and sewers. Their apogee was reached between 1890 and 1920, when they acquired electric trams, avenues built on cleared gullies, as well as imposing and luxurious buildings, such as the polished Teatro Amazonas, the government palace, the municipal market, and the customs house, in the case of Manaus; and the fish market, the iron market, Teatro da Paz, corridors of mango trees, and various residential palaces in the case of Bel√©m, constructed in large part by the intendant Ant√¥nio Lemos. These technologies and construction did not take place anywhere else in south and southeast Brazil of the time. The European influence later became notable in Manaus and Bel√©m, in the architecture and culture; and the two cities enjoyed their greatest economies and influence in the 19th century. The Amazon Basin was the source in the era for nearly 40% of all Brazil's exports. The new riches of Manaus made the city the world capital in the sale of diamonds. Thanks to rubber, the per capita income of Manaus was twice as much as the coffee-producing region (S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Esp√≠rito Santo). As payment for the export of rubber, the workers were paid in pounds sterling (¬£), the currency of the United Kingdom, which circulated in Manaus and Bel√©m during this period. =End of the Amazon's rubber monopoly= The Madeira‚ÄìMamor√© Railroad, finished in 1912, arrived too late. The Amazon was already losing primacy in rubber production, as the English had planted rubber trees in its colonies in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and tropical Africa. These rubber trees were planted from seeds that Henry Wickham had smuggled out of Brazil in 1876.\\"1876.\\" The People's Chronology. Ed. Jason M. Everett. Thomson Gale, 2006. These plantations were able to produce latex with greater efficiency and productivity. Consequently, with lower costs and a lower final price, the British Empire assumed control of the world rubber market. The Amazon's rubber was undercut in the world market and demand for it fell. This rapidly resulted in the stagnation of the regional economy. There was a lack of entrepreneurial or governmental vision to find alternatives for development. The \\"rubber barons\\" and economic elite followed the money, leaving the region to seek their next fortunes elsewhere. Malaysia, which invested in the planting of rubber trees and in latex extraction technology, was the principal cause of the loss of the Brazilian monopoly Although the railroad and the cities of Porto Velho and Guajar√°-Mirim remained as a legacy to this bright economic period, the recession caused by the end of the rubber boom left profound scars on the Amazon region. There was a massive loss of state tax income, high levels of unemployment, rural and urban emigration, and abandoned and unneeded housing. Those who remained in the region had few expectations for the future. Deprived of their income, the rubber workers remained in the periphery of Manaus, searching for new work. Because of the lack of housing, in the 1920s they built the cidade flutuante (\\"floating city\\"), a type of residence that was consolidated in the 1960s. To try to stem the crisis, the central government of Brazil created the Superintend√™ncia de Defesa da Borracha (\\"Superintendency of Defence of Rubber\\"). It was inefficient and unable to effect real change, and, for this reason, it was eliminated soon after its creation. In the 1930s, Henry Ford, the United States automobile pioneer, undertook the cultivation of rubber trees in the Amazon region. He established the city of Fordl√¢ndia in the west part of Par√° state, specifically for this end, together with worker housing and planned community amenities. The plantation suffered from a leaf pest and the effort failed. Second rubber boom, 1942-1945 Changes in the world economy during the Second World War created a new rubber boom, although it was of brief duration. As Japan dominated the western Pacific Ocean from the beginning of 1942 and invaded Malaysia, the rubber plantations there came under their control. As a result, the Allies lost access to 97% of Asian rubber production. United States companies invested in the region and their managers played an active role. New buildings were constructed in Bel√©m and Manaus. An example was the Grande Hotel, a luxurious hotel constructed in Bel√©m in only three years, which today is the Hilton Hotel. The USA also developed new Synthetic rubbers such as Government Rubber-Styrene which helped to bridge the inevitable gap in rubber supplies for truck and car tyres. =Rubber battle= Eager to supply the Allied Forces with the rubber needed for war equipment, the Brazilian government made an agreement with the United States government (the Washington Accords). It set goals for the large-scale extraction of Amazon latex, an operation which became known as the Batalha da borracha (\\"rubber battle\\"), for the manpower and effort devoted to the project. After the rubber forests were abandoned, no more than 35,000 workers remained in the region. The great challenge of Brazil was to increase the annual production of latex from 18,000 to 45,000 tons, as set in the agreement. For this, 100,000 men were needed. During the same period, the northeast part of Brazil had suffered a devastating drought and an unprecedented crisis for its farmers. Brazil decided to recruit new rubber workers from that region. The Estado Novo in 1943 ordered the compulsory enlisting of workers in the Servi√ßo Especial de Mobiliza√ß√£o de Trabalhadores para a Amaz√¥nia (SEMTA; \\"Special Service of Mobilization of Workers for the Amazon\\"), based in the northeast, in Fortaleza. Brazilian president Get√∫lio Vargas reduced the problem of the economic blight and at the same time increased colonization of the Amazon Basin. In addition to SEMTA, the government created other organizations to support the rubber battle: the Superintend√™ncia para o Abastecimento do Vale da Amaz√¥nia (SAVA: the Superintendency for the Provisioning of the Amazon Valley), the Servi√ßo Especial de Sa√∫de P√∫blica (SESP: the Special Service of Public Health), and the Servi√ßo de Navega√ß√£o da Amaz√¥nia e de Administra√ß√£o do Porto do Par√° (SNAPP: Navigation Service of the Amazon and Administration of the Port of Par√°). The Banco de Cr√©dito da Borracha (Rubber Credit Bank) was also created. Later in 1950 it became the Banco de Cr√©dito da Amaz√¥nia (Amazon Credit Bank). The international organization Rubber Development Corporation (RDC), financed with capital from United States industries, covered the expenses of relocating the migrants (known at the time as brabos). The United States government paid the Brazilian government $100 for every worker delivered to the Amazon. Thousands of workers from various regions of Brazil were transported under force to obligatory servitude. Many suffered death by tropical diseases of the region, such as malaria and yellow fever. The northeast region sent 54,000 workers to the Amazon alone, 30,000 of which were from Cear√°. These new rubber workers were called soldados da borracha (\\"rubber soldiers\\") in a clear allusion to the role of the latex in supplying the U.S. factories with the rubber necessary to fight the war. In 1849 Manaus had 5,000 inhabitants, expanding in the next half-century to 70,000. During World War II, the region again enjoyed prosperity. Money began to circulate in Manaus, Bel√©m, and other cities and towns nearby, and the regional economy gained strength.

About 30,000 rubber workers died in the Amazon, after having exhausted their energies extracting the \\"white gold.\\" They died of malaria, yellow fever, and hepatitis,* \\"Manaus Journal, For the Rubber Soldiers of Brazil, Rubber Checks\\", New York Times They also suffered attacks by animals such as panthers, serpents, and scorpions. The Brazilian government did not fulfill its promise to return the \\"rubber soldiers\\" to their homes at the end of the war as heroes and with housing comparable to that of the military veterans. \\"Brazil 'rubber soldiers' fight for recognition\\", International Herald Tribune, 13 November 2013 It is estimated that only about 6,000 workers managed to return to their homes, at their own expense. In the 21st century, the decreasing number of survivors have challenged the government for recognition and compensation for themselves and their families for their contributions to the war effort.

After playing high school football in Thermopolis, Wyoming, Bracken played college football for the University of Michigan from 1980 to 1983. As a freshman, he set a Rose Bowl record that is still unbroken with a 73-yard punt in the 1981 Rose Bowl. Bracken played professional football in the National Football League (NFL) for the Green Bay Packers (1985-1990) and Los Angeles Rams (1992-1993). In 1987, he ranked third in the NFL in both number of punts (72) and punting yardage (2,947). In eight NFL seasons, Bracken appeared in 99 NFL games and punted 461 times for 18,375 yards, an average of 39.9 yards per punt. Early years Don Bracken was born in Coalinga in Fresno County, California, in 1962. He moved with his family to Thermopolis, Wyoming, while in middle school. He attended Thermopolis High School where he was a member of the National Honor Society. He was also the punter for the school's football team, averaging 46.7 yards per punt. University of Michigan Don Bracken enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1980. He was the punter for Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines football team from 1980 to 1983. In his first appearance at Michigan Stadium, before a crowd more than 20 times larger than the population of his home town, Bracken's first punt traveled 47 yards. At the end of his freshman year, Bracken booted a Rose Bowl record 73-yard punt in the Wolverines' 23-6 victory over Washington in the 1981 Rose Bowl. In four years at Michigan, Bracken averaged 40.8 yards per punt, a school record that was later surpassed by Monte Robbins. Professional football After graduating from Michigan, Bracken signed with the Michigan Panthers of the United States Football League (USFL), but he was cut due to an injured knee. In the spring of 1984, he signed with the Kansas City Chiefs, but he failed a physical due to tendinitis in his knee. He next signed with the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos during the 1984 preseason, but was released by both clubs. Bracken ultimately signed with the Green Bay Packers in November 1985. He spent six seasons with the Packers from 1985 to 1990. In 1987, Bracken ranked third in the NFL in both number of punts (72) and punting yardage (2,947). In six seasons with the Packers, Bracken punted 368 times for 14,602 yards, an average of 39.7 yards per punt. Bracken was released by the Packers in August 1991 and did not play during the 1991 NFL season. In April 1992, Bracken signed with the Los Angeles Rams. In his NFL comeback, Bracken punted 76 times for the Rams during the 1992 NFL season, averaging a career-high 41.1 yards per punt. He returned to the Rams in 1993, but he averaged only 38.3 yards, lowest in the NFL, in 17 punts in first three games of the 1993 NFL season. He was released by the Rams in late September 1993 and replaced by Paul McJulien. In eight NFL seasons, Bracken appeared in 99 NFL games and punted 461 times for 18,375 yards, an average of 39.9 yards per punt.

Career Of a family from the Scots aristocracy, Grant, the youngest of eight brothers, was commissioned into the 11th Foot in 1795, reaching the rank of major by 1809 when he was posted to the Iberian Peninsula under the command of Arthur Wellesley, later Duke of Wellington. In 1810 he was appointed to Wellesley's personal staff as an Exploring Officer in the Peninsula Corps of Guides, a special reconnaissance unit whose members spoke the local languages. Grant never thought of himself as a spy, and always rode in full uniform, often behind enemy lines, to note the positions and strength of the enemy. Grant was captured by French forces on 16 April 1812. As he was in uniform, he was treated as an officer and gentleman by his captors, who offered him parole, which Grant accepted. His servant Leon, a local guide, was not so fortunate, and was shot. Grant was invited to dine with Marshal Auguste de Marmont, who hoped to find out more about Wellington, and who was angered by Grant's reticence. Marmont had good reason to remain suspicious of Grant, as the latter managed to send and receive secret messages while in captivity. Marmont sent Grant to Paris for interrogation. It is clear from Marmont's correspondence that he had no intention of exchanging Grant for a prisoner of equal rank, as was the custom of the time, considering him to be a spy. Grant, on seeing a copy of Marmont's letter, decided that it invalidated his parole agreement and escaped. Grant was able to pass himself off as an American officer and spent some weeks at liberty in the streets and salons of Paris, sending intelligence reports to Wellington. He then escaped to England, rejoining Wellington in early 1814. Promoted to lieutenant-colonel, he was appointed commanding officer of the Corps of Guides and Head of Intelligence for the Peninsular Army. During the Hundred Days Campaign, Grant was working as an intelligence officer in France when Wellington put him in charge of his own intelligence operations. Grant sent in a steady stream of reports regarding the build-up of French troops along the border and returned to Brussels in time to take part in the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June. In 1821, Grant transferred to the 54th Foot as lieutenant-colonel, later commanding a brigade in the First Anglo-Burmese War during the difficult Arakan campaign. In 1829, he was invalided out of the army, and his doctor, Sir James McGrigor, sent him to take the waters at Aachen. On the night of 28 September 1829, he died there. Family His son, Walter Colquhoun Grant, also became an army officer, the youngest captain in the army at 24, before financial troubles saw him become an early settler in the Colony of Vancouver Island. He later rejoined the army, serving in the Crimean War and Indian Mutiny. In media He appears as a character in Susanna Clarke's fantasy novel set in the period, Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell. The character of Major Michael Hogan in Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series of novels is loosely based on Grant. In James McGee's novel Rebellion, based on the real 'Malet Conspiracy', Grant joins forces with McGee's fictional hero, Matthew Hawkwood. Together, they take part in a plot by renegade French generals to seize control of the Empire while Napoleon Bonaparte is fighting in Russia. He appears as a character in Winston Graham's \\"The Twisted Sword\\", the eleventh book in the author's Poldark series.

Sentinel invested for clients such as managed-futures funds, high- net-worth individuals and hedge funds that want to be able to withdraw their cash quickly. Investments included short-term commercial paper, foreign currency, investment-grade bonds and Treasury notes, according to the Web site. They oversaw approximately $1.6 billion. It was founded by Philip Bloom and the CEO was his son, Eric A. Bloom.  Recent events  According to an August 13, 2007 client letter posted on thestreet.com, the company contacted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission asking for approval to halt redemptions. The letter stated in part that Sentinel Management Group is \\"concerned that we cannot meet any significant redemption requests without selling securities at deep discounts to their fair value and therefore causing unnecessary losses to our clients.\\" On August 14, the National Futures Association visited Sentinel's offices to review the company's records and prepare a report. The NFA found that \\"Sentinel failed to maintain adequate books and records, including records to demonstrate the location\\" of some accounts. Late on Friday, August 17, 2007 the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The filing stated that Sentinel estimated assets and liabilities as both exceeding $100 million, and estimated that it had over 200 creditors. The law firm of Goldberg Kohn Bell Black Rosenbloom and Moritz Ltd. was hired to represent them in the bankruptcy petition. The bankruptcy was filed after a judge sought to block Sentinel from selling assets to the hedge fund company Citadel Investment Group LLC. This stopped the withdrawals, which caused two brokerages, Farr Financial Inc. and Velocity Futures LP, to sue Sentinel. On August 20, 2007, the NFA report was presented in bankruptcy court. That same day, the SEC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court in Chicago, alleging that Sentinel had defrauded clients in two ways. First, that Sentinel improperly commingled $460 million in securities from client's investment accounts into Sentinel's proprietary \\"house account\\", and secondly, that Sentinel used securities from their client's accounts as collateral to obtain a $321 million line of credit and other leveraged financing. Sentinel allegedly disguised these acts by providing falsified account statements. On June 1, 2012, Eric A. Bloom (CEO) and Charles K. Mosley head trader were indicted on federal fraud charges for allegedly defrauding more than 70 customers of more than $500 million before the firm collapsed in August 2007. On March 25, 2014, the chief executive officer of the bankrupt Sentinel Management Group, Inc., was convicted of defrauding more than 70 customers of more than $500 million before the firm collapsed in August 2007. The defendant, ERIC A. BLOOM, misappropriated securities belonging to customers by using them as collateral for a loan that Sentinel obtained from Bank of New York Mellon Corp., which was used, in part, to purchase millions of dollars' worth of high-risk, illiquid securities, not for customers but for a trading portfolio maintained for the benefit of Sentinel's officers, including Bloom, members of his family, and corporations controlled by the Bloom family.

The 1975 team played in the 1976 Orange Bowl and finished the season ranked No. 8 in the AP and UPI polls. As a junior, Downing was the starting center in all 12 games played by the 1976 Michigan team that won the Big Ten Conference championship, advanced to the 1977 Rose Bowl, and finished the season ranked No. 3 in both the AP and UPI Polls. He was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference center after the 1976 season. As a senior, Downing was a co-captain of the 1977 Michigan team. For the second consecutive season, he was the starting center in all 12 games played by the Michigan team. The team won Michigan's second consecutive conference championship, played in the 1978 Rose Bowl, and finished the season ranked No. 9 and No. 8 in the AP and UPI Polls. He was a starter on Michigan's 1975 and 1976 offensive lines that produced two games in which Michigan had three rushers accumulate 100 yards. At the end of the 1977 season, Downing was selected as a first-team All-American by UPI, The Sporting News, the American Football Coaches Association, Kodak, and Playboy. Downing was the seventh Michigan center to be selected as a first-team All-American. He was also named the best collegiate offensive lineman by the Touchdown Club of Columbus, Ohio. Professional football Downing was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the second round (47th overall pick) of the 1978 NFL Draft. He signed a contract with the 49ers in June 1978. As a rookie in 1978, Downing was a starter in 15 of 16 regular season games for the 49ers. He was named to the UPI's NFL All-Rookie team at the end of the 1978 season.

Between 1939 and 1945, Spur 69 referred to a short section of what is now SH 12 near Deweyville. The current location in Austin was first assigned in 1969. In 1990, Spur 69 was redesignated as SH 169; the designation was reverted to Spur 69 in 1991. There already was a SH 69 at the time. Route description Koenig Lane (Spur 69) heading east from Lamar Boulevard. Note that the road is signed as RM 2222.Spur 69 begins at an intersection with North Lamar Boulevard in Austin, Travis County, where the roadway continues northwest as RM 2222. From here, the highway heads southeast as West Koenig Lane, a four-lane divided highway signed as RM 2222. The road passes businesses before heading into residential areas with some commercial establishments, becoming East Koenig Lane. Spur 69 crosses the Capital MetroRail Red Line, turning east and becoming an undivided freeway with frontage roads. The highway reaches an interchange with Airport Boulevard south of the Highland Mall and becomes a divided highway again as it comes to a large interchange with I-35/US 290. It is east of this interchange that Spur 69 ends and the freeway continues east as part of US 290. History Spur 69 was first designated in Deweyville, Newton County on September 26, 1939, running from SH 87 to the Sabine River as a renumbering of SH 87A. This road was replaced with a portion of SH 235 on October 27, 1945, which became SH 12 on August 27, 1959. The current Spur 69 was designated on January 21, 1969 to run from I-35 west to Koenig Lane near the Southern Pacific railroad tracks. The highway was extended west 0.7 miles to its current western terminus at RM 2222 and North Lamar Boulevard on January 31, 1972. On October 17, 1989, Spur 69 was replaced with SH 169 (a proposed freeway) upon these requirements: local support as exhibited by the passage of a referendum election; and the City of Austin's support of a west/east controlled access facility in this corridor.

History =Origins= The present building is the second Government House on this site. The first one was a prefabricated wooden structure manufactured by Mannings of London, a firm which specialised in such structures. Apparently the Auckland house supplied to the first Governor of New Zealand was similar to the one sent to Saint Helena to house Napoleon (although he refused to move into it). Built for William Hobson, the first Governor, the Auckland House caught fire in 1848 during the Governorship of Sir George Grey and he and successive Governors occupied rented houses until the current structure was built; these included Scoria House on Karangahape Road (later called St Kevins) and Hulme court in Parnell. The current building was designed by William Mason, and was completed in 1856 as one of the measures taken by Auckland to retain its status as New Zealand's capital. However, the house was used only sporadically after the seat of government was moved to Wellington in 1865. The wooden Italianate mansion endured criticism from architects and lay people alike, many disliked the flat, pasteboard effect of the fa√ßade and the dishonest imitation of stone masonry in wood. In the 1860s Governor Gore Browne lobbied for a new residence to be built in the nearby Auckland Domain. The intended building (possibly by Rumsey) was a stone Gothic castellated residence strongly resembling the one in Sydney. This sparked criticism partly because of what was perceived as extravagance but also because it would allow part of the Auckland Domain to be alienated from public use. There was also the possibility of the capital being relocated to Wellington which would make an Auckland Government House unnecessary. For these reasons the Weld administration refused funds for such a structure. =Move to Wellington= The Capital was relocated to Wellington in 1864 but Auckland wielded considerable clout and the Government found itself maintaining two residences for the Governor. Having more than one Government House in a country as small as New Zealand doubtless seemed extravagant but the Governor General continues to this day to alternate between Wellington and Auckland. There were even other Vice-regal residences for a while; Christchurch and a temporary one at Palmerston North. The house in Christchurch was called Elmwood, was owned by Sir Heaton Rhodes and was in use during the time of Lord Ranfurly. The Palmerston North House, now called Caccia-Birch, was where Lord Plunket moved to after the disastrous fire in 1907 which gutted the Parliament Buildings. Lord Plunket lent the Vice-Regal residence in Wellington for Parliament to meet in (he had been lobbying for a larger Government House to be provided in any case). The Palmerston North House was the residence of the Governor General between 1908 and 1910 while the new Wellington Government House was under construction. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip at Auckland Government House, 23 December 1953 Royalty have stayed at the house six times, and Queen Elizabeth II broadcast her Christmas speech from the House in 1953. Old Government House was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I heritage structure on 24 November 1983. =University of Auckland= The Auckland House felt more and more hemmed in as the 20th century progressed especially after apartment blocks began to appear on Waterloo Quadrant. In 1969, Sir Frank and Lady Mappin donated the current Government House (Birchlands) which is located in Mount Eden. In the same year, Old Government House in Waterloo Quadrant became formally part of the University of Auckland. The interior has been rationalised and altered over the years and although much original detailing remains in the main rooms the atmosphere of a palatial residence is conspicuously absent. All the spaces are fairly institutional in manner although the main rooms are decorated with a selection from the University's collection of New Zealand art. Various parts of the building are used as the Staff Common Room, Council reception suite, flats for visiting academics, rooms for the Federation of Graduate Women, while the former Ballroom is a lecture theatre. Various events continue to be held on the front lawn continuing the tradition of Vice-Regal Garden Parties. The garden contains many specimen trees planted by visiting dignitaries and Governors, in particular George Grey. There is also a rose garden which was planted and tended by successive Governors' wives. The site of the former Governor's Stable block was replaced in the 1960s by the Biology Department which is screened from the main, while the adjacent greenhouse complex and Tennis Courts have likewise been replaced by University buildings.

He was recognised as the most successful air gunner in Bomber Command, having shot down eight enemy aircraft (7 were shared with M/U Gunner Larry Sutherland) two \\"probables\\" and one \\"damaged\\" (also shared with Sutherland). In one operation on the day after D-Day, they shot down three German night fighters. Early life McIntosh was born in a barn in Tarves in Aberdeenshire during a blizzard. His mother was an unmarried teenage servant. He was raised by his grandparents alongside their seven children, moving from farm to farm in Perthshire and Aberdeenshire in search of seasonal work. He attended fourteen schools, finally leaving at the age of 13. He worked as an agricultural labourer, but helped to support his family by poaching sheep, salmon and pheasants. He later became a gamekeeper.[Undiscovered Scotland website ‚Äì Wallace McIntosh] Royal Air Force service On the outbreak of the Second World War, he rode his bicycle the to Dundee, aiming to join the RAF, but was rejected on account of his poor education. At the urging of a local priest, the RAF relented and he was recruited as an aircraftman. He served on the ground, but became an air gunner in March 1943, and joined 207 Squadron at RAF Langar, near Nottingham, as a mid-upper turret gunner in the Lancaster bomber flown by Flying Officer Fred Richardson. He claimed two German aircraft \\"probably destroyed\\" during his first tour of 32 missions, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal on 15 October 1943. After his first tour of duty, he became an air gunnery instructor. He was commissioned pilot officer on 5 June 1943, and promoted flying officer on 5 December 1943. He returned to active duty with 207 Squadron at RAF Spilsby in Lincolnshire in February 1944, as a rear gunner in the Lancaster flown by Wing Commander John Grey, the squadron's commander. He shot down a Bf 110 in a raid over Mailly-le-Camp in Champagne on 3 May 1944 (The only kill he had without Sutherland, whose logbook records no flight that day). On 7 June 1944, he joined a raid of 112 Lancaster bombers in support of the D-Day landings the previous day, attacking a concentration of German tanks in woods near Cerisy-la-For√™t, between Bayeux and St L√¥ in Normandy. He and a colleague, Canadian Pilot Officer Larry Sutherland, together shot down two Ju 88s on the way to the target. In the return journey, they shot down an Me 210 over Beachy Head. Both gunners were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) in the London Gazette 11 July 1944. The citation reads: McIntosh received a congratulatory Postagram from the usually taciturn Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris.[Pilot Officer Prune ‚Äì biography of Wallace McIntosh] In July 1944, he shot down two German night fighters in a raid on Stuttgart and was awarded a Bar to his DFC on 8 December 1944 at the end of his second tour of a further 23 operations. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 5 June 1945 having held the acting rank for some time. McIntosh applied to extend his service postwar and was granted a 4-year extended commission from 18 December 1945 as a flying officer. He resigned his commission and left the RAF on 19 June 1948. Later life He worked as a salesman of agricultural foodstuffs in Scotland, and then worked for a seed merchant. His biography, Gunning for the Enemy, was published in 2003.[web link to W McIntosh's biography \\"Gunning for the enemy\\"] He married Christina Cooper in 1957.

He had previously played for the Michigan Wolverines football team in Ann Arbor from 1973 to 1975. He was chosen to serve as team captain for both the Seahawks and Wolverines. At Michigan, he was following in the footsteps of his father Don Dufek, Sr. who had been a Wolverine team Most Valuable Player. As a graduate of Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor, Dufek was able to stay close to home while performing as a two-sport star at the University of Michigan where he played for the Michigan Wolverines football and hockey teams. In football, he was a member of back-to-back Big Ten Conference championship teams at Michigan and became an All-American as well as a team captain. Dufek, was sought after as a professional athlete in two sports: Dufek was drafted by teams in the National Hockey League, World Hockey Association and National Football League. He opted for football and played his entire professional career with the Seahawks. He endured several unsuccessful seasons in Seattle, but the team made the playoffs in his final two years. In his role as a special teams player, he again became a team captain.  Youth  Dufek grew up attending games at Michigan Stadium. Dufek grew up in Ann Arbor, the son of former fullback, Don Dufek, Sr., who was named Most Valuable Player of the 1950 Michigan Wolverines football team and the MVP of the 1951 Rose Bowl. In 1971, Dufek played linebacker for Ann Arbor Pioneer High School and was one of only three unanimous picks for the major All-State football teams in the State of Michigan, as selected by the United Press International (UPI), Associated Press (AP), and Detroit Free Press. The coach of Pioneer's cross-town rival Huron High School said of Dufek in 1971: \\"He's the best I've seen.\\" In a 2003 interview with the Grand Rapids Press, Dufek recalled growing up in Ann Arbor and meeting his father's Michigan teammates. \\"Living in Ann Arbor, and seeing all the things that embody a great university, you learned that there were highly successful people in athletics, and it just made you want to feel a part of it. Then, as you got older, and you got more deeply involved in the game yourself, you just hoped that you had a chance to play in college -- and after watching all those games at Michigan Stadium, that maybe Michigan would take a chance on you.\\"  University of Michigan  Dufek's only bowl game was in the 1976 Orange Bowl. = Football = Michigan provided Dufek with the opportunity that he had hoped for. He played defensive back for the Wolverines from 1973 to 1975 and was named a team co-captain and an All-American as a member of the 1975 Wolverines team. He was chosen as a first-team All-American by the Football Writers Association of America, and the Walter Camp Football Foundation, and as a second-team All-American by UPI. Twice named an All-Big Ten safety, Dufek had 249 tackles, nine fumble recoveries and four interceptions for the Wolverines. Although the 1973 and 1974 Michigan teams were Big Ten co-champions, the Ohio State Buckeyes advanced to the Rose Bowl both years, and Dufek's only bowl game appearance was in a 14-6 loss to the Oklahoma in the 1976 Orange Bowl. = Hockey = In addition to receiving three varsity letters in football, Dufek also received four letters as a left wing for the Michigan Wolverines hockey team. Dufek played with the hockey team only after the football season ended, and he managed to score about 10 goals a year in the shortened seasons he played. Dufek made a sufficiently solid showing in his freshman and sophomore years at Michigan that the Detroit Red Wings selected him in the sixth round of the 1974 NHL amateur draft. He was also drafted by the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the World Hockey Association with the 162nd overall selection in the eleventh round of the 1974 WHA Amateur Draft. In a 1975 interview, Dufek noted his love of both sports: \\"There are times when I've thought of dropping one or the other, but heck, I've been doing this since high school and it would be pretty tough to quit them both now.\\" Dufek added: \\"Hockey is a more relaxed thing. It's a smaller atmosphere and you have to deal with only one or two coaches. You can be more individual and flashy. Football has certain assignments and you can't really express yourself.\\" In the end, however, Dufek chose the NFL over the NHL. He explained: \\"I've decided to pursue professional football because I would probably have an extensive tour in the hockey minor leagues and I don't want that.\\"  Seattle Seahawks  Dufek was drafted by the Seahawks with the second selection of fifth round and 126th overall selection of the 1976 NFL Draft. Dufek was one of the original Seahawks in 1976, the franchise's first year in the NFL, and he played for them until 1984. He was the captain of the Seahawks' special teams units in 1981 and 1982. During both of these seasons he was co-captain along with eventual Pro Football Hall of Famer and four-term representative in United States House of Representatives, Steve Largent, the captain of the offensive unit and Keith Simpson, captain of the defensive unit. Over the course of his career he had three interceptions, two quarterback sacks, a fumble recovery and thirteen kickoff returns. Sportswriter Richard Kucner once wrote: \\"Don Dufek was the kind of guy who just won't take 'No' for an answer. He was released in training camp four times during his eight-year Seahawks career. But each time, Seattle had a change of heart, bringing him back. Today, he is remembered as one of the best special teams performers the team has had.\\" After numerous seasons under Jack Patera from 1976-1982 and interim coach Mike McCormack in 1982, the Seahawks finally reached the playoffs in Dufek's final two seasons under Chuck Knox. During the 1983 NFL season, the Seahawks went 9-7 and reached the AFC Championship Game where they lost to the Oakland Raiders. Then, during the 1984 NFL season, the Seahawks went 12-4 and failed to reach the Conference Championships during the 1984-85 Playoffs. Dufek was interviewed by the Ann Arbor News in 2006 about life in Seattle. He said: \\"It's a bigger version of Ann Arbor. It's overcast, and it's green and clean.\\" And there's the coffee. \\"It's really comical,\\" says Dufek of all the coffee stops in Seattle. \\"Even the gas stations have coffee bars.\\"  Family  Dufek now lives in Ann Arbor with his wife Candi Dufek. Dufek ran his own construction company, Dufek Wolverine Construction. In December 2006, the Detroit Free Press did a feature about the Dufek family and their big U-M tailgate parties. The article noted: \\"It's hard to get more maize and blue than the Dufek family. Candy Dufek met Donnie Dufek in the first grade in Ann Arbor, and cheered as he played under Bo Schembechler in the 1970s. Younger brother, Bill also played for U-M from 1974-78, also attaining All-American status. Their younger brother Joe, however, played for Yale (as well as pro ball as a quarterback for the Buffalo Bills and San Diego Chargers). They are the sons of legendary U-M Hall of Famer, Don Dufek, Sr., who scored two touchdowns in U-M's 1951 Rose Bowl win.\\" Dufek has two children, Jacqueline and Frank.

The amplifiers are named for the cloth covering, which consists of varnished cotton twill, incorrectly called tweed because of its feel and appearance. They are praised for their sound, their circuitry considered \\"hallowed ground\\". Fender generally stopped using the twill covering in 1960, though the Harvard was still covered in twill until 1963, and the Champ until 1964. In 1953, Fender introduced the \\"wide panel\\" construction, where the top and bottom panels are wider than the side panels. In the later \\"narrow panels\\", introduced in 1955, all panels have approximately the same size. Later amplifiers used tolex for the covering. Beginning in 1990, Fender began to utilize the tweed covering once again, starting with the '59 Bassman Reissue.http://ampwares.com/amplifiers/fender- bassman-59-reissue/ Some later amplifier models came in the split option of tweed or black tolex covering, including the Blues Juniorhttp://ampwares.com/amplifiers/fender-blues-jr/ and Pro Junior.http://ampwares.com/amplifiers/fender-pro-junior/ The Fender Blues Deluxe and Blues DeVille and their later reissues were also available in tweed,http://www.fender.com/series/hot-rod/ as well as the Custom Shop reissues of several of the Tweed Era amplifiers.

The organization started with one leased paddock and two horses, but now owns 136 acres, Dreamchase Farm, with additional leased pasturage. It is the only Thoroughbred retirement facility in the United States that accepts stallions on a regular basis. Old Friends is currently home to over 150 retired Thoroughbred athletes. Background Geldings share pastures at Old Friends, becoming close friends The facility was created in 2003 by former The Boston Globe movie critic Michael Blowen, spurred by the death of 1986 Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand in 2002. The presence of high- profile horses helps raise money, allowing after-care for more low profile horses. In 2009, Joann and Mark Pepper's farm in Greenfield Center, New York, became a satellite operation of Old Friends Equine known as Old Friends at Cabin Creek: The Bobby Frankel Division named for U.S. Racing Hall of Fame trainer Bobby Frankel, who died in 2009. In 2015, Old Friends announced a partnership with Kentucky Downs, with the cooperation and assistance of Simpson County Tourism. Located on the Kentucky-Tennessee border, this satellite facility can house up to 10 retired Thoroughbreds and features daily tours and a gift shop. Residents currently include Canadian Horse of the Year Thornfield, Ball Four, Rumor Has It, Hussonfirst, Lusty Latin, and Sgt. Bert. In January 2015, Old Friends was selected to receive a special Eclipse Award honoring extraordinary service or contributions to the Thoroughbred industry. In January 2016, a fire destroyed the organization's hospital/quarantine barn. Forunately, no horses or people were harmed. Plans are underway to rebuild a new fire-safe barn, aided by donations and fundraising activities. Horses are kept \\"turned out\\" in their pasture as much as possible, with run-in sheds available in case of bad weather. Geldings typically share a paddock with one or two others, forming tight bonds. Stallions are more territorial and are thus kept in separate pastures. They do interact with each other though, often by racing down their fences. Visitors are allowed to touch and feed most of the retirees. The board of directors consists of Michael Blowen (president), William Van Den Dool (vice president), Diane White (secretary), Rosie Napravnik, Dr. Steve Allday, Clark Nyberg, Cindy Grisolia, Suzanne Mundy, Dennis Brida, Ron Portell, Ron Wallace, Mark Otto, Barbara Fossum and Corey Johnsen.

While the organization did evolve from a local level, it is now recognized at a national level. The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles organizes and serves individuals, institutions and coalitions to build power, transform public opinion, and change policies to achieve full human, civil and labor rights. The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles also has aided in passing new laws and policies to benefit the immigrant community regardless of documented status. History The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles is considered to be one of Los Angeles' oldest organizations advocating for immigrant rights. In 1986, the creation of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles or CHIRLA, was funded by the Ford Foundation in efforts to help educate immigrants about the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The Ford Foundation also had hopes of addressing anti-immigrant sentiment that was evolving within the context of immigration debate in the United States of America. Following the funding from the Ford Foundation, CHIRLA was to help undocumented immigrants about the pathway to citizenship while also informing immigrants about their workers' right in the labor force. CHIRLA was founded in 1986 as a result of the Immigration Reform and Control Act. Since its founding, CHIRLA has evolved in three major components. When being founded, the organization focused on issues such as providing immigrants the resources to leadership development, organizing and mobilizing. Another component CHIRLA focused on was focusing on its own programs and committees while also trying to create other organizations that were interested on similar issues as CHIRLA. Resulting in a transition from focusing on immigrant issues at a local level to immigrant issues at a national level. This focus helped the organization with challenging laws that limited workers' rights at a local and national level. Present day, CHIRLA works with different organization around the nation in hopes of influencing future federal legislation. Following the passage of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, representatives from Central American Resource Center (CARECEN), Asian Pacific American Legal Center (APALC) now known as Asian Americans Advancing Justice, Los Angeles Center for Law and Justice, and Dolores Mission and other voluntary agencies and local legal service coalitions formed a steering committee to coordinate the efforts of charities, legal service organizations, and advocacy organizations. The steering committee served the purpose of different organizations and coalitions collectively working towards issues surrounding the immigrant community. The steering committee would also provided more services to serve as many migrants as possible in Los Angeles. By December 1992, CHIRLA acted on its mission of \\"advance the human and civil rights of immigrants and refugees and to foster an environment of positive human and community relations in our society.\\" Three years later, CHIRLA had brought together about eighty members of the coalition in order to represent and address different issues within the immigrant community. With the sponsorship of United Way, CHIRLA was formed. In 1993, it was granted 501(c)(3) non-profit status. In the same year, faced with major changes to laws pertaining to unauthorized immigrants from California Proposition 187, CHIRLA established a hotline, which allowed immigrants to call in with concerns on different subjects, one specific one being Proposition 187. CHIRLA also established the only Spanish-Language hotline in Southern California, allowing undocumented immigrants to voice their concerns about this proposition and attain information on what to do. On the day after the election, November 9, 1994, CHIRLA's hotline reported over 250 calls received that day. In addition, during the 11 months after Proposition 187 was passed, CHIRLA recorded 229 cases of serious rights abuses, 72 of which involved denial of services and discrimination in sectors affected by this proposition, which included schools or health clinics. During the early 2000s, the federal immigration enforcement intensified, as Program 287(g), which was under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, began to be used by various states across the United States. As a response, CHIRLA began to take initiative to inform and make undocumented immigrants aware of the program and its consequences through factsheets and other resources. In 2006, CHIRLA was a part of the We Are America Alliance, which partook in the 2006 United States Immigration Reform Protests, advocating for immigration reform and was a response to changing immigration policy. The alliance was a major outcome of the protests, in which more than 2 million people were mobilized. During the Bush and Obama Era, The Secure Communities Program was introduced and heavily used, with immigrants being detailed for minor infractions such as routine traffic stops. As a result of consistent activism from multiple groups including CHIRLA, Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca in 2013 announced that his agency would limit their participation in Secure Communities, and would not send fingerprints to ICE for low tier cases. CHIRLA is led by an eight-person board. Activities = Organizing and Mobilizing = During the late 1980s, CHIRLA's activities focused on three major areas: education, political advocacy, and community organization. At this time, majority of their advocacy work was centered around helping undocumented immigrants fill out their applications that would grant them a form of legal status through the amnesty provision of the Immigration Reform and Control Act. Following a couple of years, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles created a national hotline designed to connect immigrants (who had just been granted legal status) to resources such as legal aid, health, education and welfare services. Community organizational campaigns include efforts to organize domestic workers, day laborers, and undocumented students. In 1988, CHIRLA initiated to expand their services to household workers through their Immigrant Women's Taskforce. At the same time, the coalition advocated for the opening of day labor centers in the City of Los Angeles, which eventually led to the opening of the Harbor City Job Center a year later. The focus on these two committees created a shift in the organization's focus. While CHIRLA had been focusing on the advocacy of the undocumented individual, it then shifted to worker's rights and advocating for low-wage workers in the city of Los Angeles. CHIRLA continues to advocate and organize for the Day Laborer, Household Worker and Street Vendor Committees. In 2004, The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, in collaboration with the San Francisco Bay Area Domestic Worker Coalition and the Los Angeles Pilipino Workers formed the California Domestic Workers' Coalition. The Coalition then introduced Assembly Bill 2536, which upheld domestic workers being compensated for overtime and fined employers who failed to comply with this provision. The bill passed in both houses and was vetoed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. CHIRLA has worked with many different organizations and advocacy networks that targeted specific immigrant rights issues. One of the coalitions, CHIRLA has worked with is the Coalition of Garment Worker Advocates (CGWA). The goal of the Coalition of Garment Worker Advocates was to acknowledge labor law violations in relationship to the Los Angeles garment industry. During the year 2001 came the coalition's creation of the Garment Worker Center. The center provided a space for garment workers to unite and create alternatives to better working conditions. In 1995, CHIRLA and other immigrant rights groups formally established the Sweatshop Watch in response to the El Monte Thai Garment Slavery Case, whose goal was to eliminate the exploitation and illegal working conditions in the garment industry. The Sweatshop Watch group offered social and legal services to the Thai workers in specific, and pushed to meet with the workers who were in INS Detention Centers, to make them aware of their legal rights as an immigrant. The members of this group mobilized to find the Thai workers food, clothing, jobs, housing, and medical care. Many churches, hospitals, and shelters donated places to stay for these immigrants. As a result of these efforts, most of these Thai workers were found a new job within a few months. The coalition has also been an advocate for undocumented student access to higher education at a state level. CHIRLA established many clubs in local Los Angeles high schools in order to provide support and resources to undocumented students. The coalition also contributed to the campaign for undocumented students and their accessibility to in-state tuition while attending California's public higher education institutions. CHIRLA was one of the advocacy groups that advocated alongside Assembly member Marco Firebaugh's effort to pass Assembly Bill 540, a California bill which would allow undocumented students in-state tuition. Undocumented students were to have lived in California for at least three years while also graduating high school from an accredited California high school. In 2003, CHIRLA initiated the California Dream Network which would help connect immigrant students groups to federal legislation that would help granting legal status to undocumented students.The proposed federal Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act would allow undocumented students to legalize their status via higher education or in the armed forces. Education is carried out through seminars, office visits, telephone calls, trainings, information fairs, townhall meetings, and media outreach. CHIRLA, along with the production company Cin√©tico Productions, produced the informational DVD Know Your Rights!

They are endemic to Ecuador. Since March 2014, they have been listed as Extinct in the Wild by the IUCN. Description  Brugmansia versicolor is a bush or small tree reaching in height. It has an alternate insertion of elliptic/oblong leaves that are entire with smooth edges. One of the most prominent characteristics of B. versicolor is the presence of giant drooping flowers which hang upside down, which is where it gets its common name of Angel's Trumpet. The flowers are the largest of all Brugmansia at in length. They open first white, but then may age to turn peach, pink, apricot or remain white.  Taxonomy  There are currently 7 distinct species of Brugmansia recognized, and they are very similar to their close relative Datura. For this reason the two genera were commonly mistaken for one another. ‚ÄúIt was not until the discovery of the New World that Brugmansias appeared in the documented floras and later in gardens of the Old World. Initially Brugmansias were grouped with Daturas by the famous botanist Carl Linn√©, who documented them in 1753 from a drawing and not from live plant material. In 1805, the South African taxonomist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon created a separate genus for Brugmansia, but it was not until 1973 that Tom E. Lockwood created a final division between the two genera.Lockwood TE. 1973 Generic recognition of Brugmansia. Bot. Mus. Leafl. Harvard Univ. 23. (6): 273-284 (1973) The different genera of the family Solanaceae include many crop plants such as potatoes and tomatoes, as well as several other poisonous plants.  Distribution and habitat  Brugmansia species are native to the western part of South America, originating from Guayaquil Basin and south of the Gulf of Guayaquil in Ecuador. They are usually found growing in flat areas at elevations up to , but are also frequently cultivated at low elevations throughout the tropics. 200px  Ecology  Brugmansia versicolor is a hermaphrodite that reproduces perennially. It has long, narrow, fusiform berries that are up to in length. Brugmansia reproduce by the production of seeds. The major pollinators are thought to be various species of insects, though this has yet to be proven.  Culture  Brugmansia in Pashupatinath Temple Brugmansia can withstand a wide range of temperatures including those that are slightly below freezing. A moderate frost will damage the plant in colder climates. Brugmansia will grow well if placed in a partially shaded or fully lit position. The plants tend to wilt in hot temperatures, but quickly recover in the evening as their flowers begin to open. They thrive in very fertile soils and average humidity. Clones can easily be made from stem cuttings, and Brugmansia grow readily from viable seeds, however the plant will not self pollinate.  Toxicity  According to Dr. Russell, of North Carolina State University, Brugmansia versicolor is exceptionally poisonous if ingested in large quantities. It contains various alkaloids that have toxic properties which affect the mind and body. Some of these alkaloids include atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine. No matter if swallowed or inhaled, the flowers, leaves, and seeds of Brugmansia will most likely cause symptoms of hallucinations, dry mouth, muscle weakness, increased blood pressure, increased pulse, fever, dilated pupils, temporary insanity, and paralysis.

Background Gar Neale's great grandfather and family migrated to New Zealand from Stroud, Gloucestershire, England, in the 1840s, settling in Auckland. In the 1850s, Neale's grandfather, John William Neale, moved to Nelson. Gar Neale's father, Henry Neale, was born in Nelson and worked as a carpenter. Henry married Kate Bethwaite.Three Generations of Neale Family History from 1842 by June E Neale (1974 Nelson) Henry and Kate had two children; Gar (born in 1889 in Nelson) and Gladys (born in 1893). =Education= Neale was educated at Nelson Central School and Nelson College (1903‚Äì1905),Nelson College Old Boys Register 1925 where he took a general academic course. He became a part-time master at the college (1920‚Äì1932),Nelson College Old Boys Register 1856-1956 teaching Commercial Practice. He was Secretary of the Nelson College Old Boys Association (1921‚Äì1935), and its President (1938‚Äì1947). He also served on the Colleges Board of Governors. During his stay in Blenheim (1915‚Äì1919), Neale completed his accountancy diplomas. =Career= Neale was first employed as a law clerk with Maginnity and Son (later Maginnity, Samuel and Hunter). About 1911 he transferred to Adams and Harley as an accounts clerk. From 1915 to 1919 he was employed by Griffiths Brothers Limited in Blenheim. Returning to Nelson from Blenheim in 1920, he went into partnership with J E Milner as a public accountant, auditor, and secretary. The firm later became E R Neale and Son, when his son joined him. =Family= Neale married Florence Myrtle Parsonage, the daughter of Henry Bruce Parsonage and Ellen Penn, on 26 December 1911.Marriages, pg1, Evening Post, Wellington, 4 January 1912 They had four sons. In the 1951 New Year Honours, Florence Neale was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for public services in Nelson. His sister, Gladys Neale, married Howard Knight.

The two-storey wooden home had been built in the early 1900s. The Neales named the home Green GablesGreen Gables History by Barbara Hodgson (The Nelson Mail, Nelson 18 May 2007, pg 13) and lived there until about the time his first wife, Florence, died in 1954. In 1957 the house was sold to Presbyterian Support Services and became a rest home. Neale moved to a new home in Moana Avenue on the Port Hills overlooking Tahuna Beach where he resided until his death. Sport In 1902, he was reported as participating in the Nelson Athletic and Cycling Club Labour Weekend Central School 100-yard and 220-yard running races.Nelson Athletic and Cycling Club - Labour Day (Nelson Evening Mail Vol XXXVI 9 October 1902 pg 2) Although not placed he appears to have had an interest in sports from an early age.

He loved horse racing and was Secretary of the Nelson Trotting Club from 1923 and the Nelson Jockey Club (1923‚Äì1949). =Cricket= Neale represented Nelson in cricket from 1904 while still at college aged 16 years. He first captained Nelson in 1910 when he was only 21 years old.Nelson Correspondent of the \\"New Zealand Free Lance\\" 1939 By 1926 he had played 52 matches for Nelson including playing for the Hawke Cup. He continued to represent Nelson until 1945, with a short break (1915‚Äì1920) playing representative cricket for Marlborough when he lived in Blenheim. During this period he was noted as \\"giving powerful help to Marlborough\\".pg 53 New Zealand Cricket Vol II by T W Reese (1936, Whitcombe and Tombs Limited) He represented the South Island (1922) and the New Zealand Minor Associations (1921) in first-class cricket. By 1928 Neale had made over 1,000 runs for his club. His statistics for representative cricket were 73 innings, 3 not outs, 201 highest score, 2,223 total runs, and 31.7 run average.pg 179 He also achieved his highest score of 201 runs against Wellington during this period.

In the intervening years (1941‚Äì1947), he was Mayor of Nelson. =Member of Parliament= In 1946, he stood as the National Party candidate for Nelson and was elected, replacing the legendary and recently deceased Harry Atmore, an MP who had held the electorate for 30 years. In his maiden speech on 9 July 1947,p 352, New Zealand Parliamentary Debates, Vol 276 24 June - 29 July 1947 Neale stated that he had entered Parliament with \\"a deep sense of responsibility and with some humility\\". He went on to say: \\"I will try to remember that the other fellow has a right to his own opinion\\" and quoted from Rudyard Kiplings poem If. Under Sidney Holland, he was a Parliamentary Under-Secretary from 1950 to 1954 to the Minister of Industries and Commerce (Charles Bowden, followed by Jack Watts), but stepped down from this position due a prolonged periods of illness. Neale was apparently so ill that he was unable to campaign during the and yet increased his majority. This prompted a telegram from Sir Clifton Webb, Attorney-General that stated that \\"apparently it was better to lie in bed than lie on the platform\\".p3330, New Zealand Parliamentary Debates, Vol 314, 19 Sept - 24 Oct 1957 For a number of years he was the Chairman of Parliament's Public Accounts Committee. In 1956 he together with Hon Sir Thomas Macdonald, Minister of External Affairs, and the member of Parliament for Ponsonby, Ritchie Macdonald, represented the New Zealand government at General Committee meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Jamaica. =Results for the Nelson Electorate by- election= { width=65% ----- align=centerElection align=centerNational align=centerLabour align=centerMajority ----- bgcolor=#DDFFDD align=center1946 align=center52.10% align=center47.90% align=center 585 ----- bgcolor=#FFFFFE align=center1949 align=center54.40% align=center45.60% align=center1,373 ----- bgcolor=#FFE8E8 align=center1951 align=center58.80% align=center41.20% align=center2,831 ----- bgcolor=#EEEEEE align=center1954 align=center45.70% align=center41.00% align=center 717 ----- bgcolor=#EED8D2 } He represented the Nelson electorate from 1946 to 1957, when he retired. =Battle to save the Nelson Railway= Neale was a strong supporter of the Nelson railway line, and extending it to link with the South Island system.page 159 Rails to Nowhere - History of the Nelson Railway by Lois Voller (1991 Nikau Press)p197 When Nelson Had a Railway by Barry O'Donnell (2005 Schematics Limited, Wellington) However this was against National policy, and in 1954 Minister of Railways Stan Goosman announced the suspension of the Nelson-Glenhope line, and a five-year programme of accelerated road development. As a result of submissions from Neale, who was supported by the Nelson Progress League, the closure was deferred to allow time for the League to attempt to increase rail use. The League made some progress but insufficient to reach the levels required. The Government announced that the line would therefore be closed. On 17 September 1955, the Nelson Progress League held a protest rally.p238 When Nelson Had a Railway Neale, as MP for Nelson, was one of the speakers. Also speaking at the protest were Jerry Skinner, MP for Buller, and Walter Nash, then Leader of the Labour Party. As a protest on 20 September 1955, Neale crossed the floor at Parliament on one occasion and voted with the opposition.p99 Bread and Roses, Sonja Davies, 1984 It may have been through this turbulent time that he forged a friendship with Mabel Howard, a famous Labour MP. Her bibliographer noted that he was one of a few gentlemanly National MPs who were close friends with her. Neale gave his valedictory speech on 25 October 1957. His obituary later stated that Neale was \\"noted for his sincerity of address\\" (in Parliament). He died after a period of illness in Nelson on 25 July 1960. On that same day the Nelson Progressive League was pressing the then Labour government to reinstate the Nelson Railway.Expedition on Nelson Railway Bill wanted p19, Evening Post, Wellington, Tuesday 26 July 1960 That same day Neale died, the National Party was holding its conference.

Subsequently, Cu√©llar joined Real Murcia who had been just relegated to division two, appearing rarely in his debut year. On 31 August 2009 he was loaned for a season to another side in that tier, UD Salamanca, being released by the former in the following off-season. Personal life Cu√©llar's older brother, Crescencio (born 1970), was also a footballer. A forward who was also brought up in Lezama, he managed four appearances in the first division, with Athletic (one match) and CP M√©rida (three).

Species of Bulbine resemble Haworthia and Aloe in appearance, but with soft, fleshy leaves and tuberous roots or a caudex. They are shrubs, weedy perennials, dwarf geophytes, and soft annuals. Many of the dwarf species have small, dome-shaped tubers. Dormancy usually extends from late spring to autumn, but it varies among species and in different conditions. The leaves die and drop, the roots contract into the caudex, and the aboveground parts wither.

It is an epiphyte with cylindrical leaves and up to about forty small, white and purplish flowers and is endemic to Cameroon. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical, moist montane forests, where it is threatened by habitat loss. Description Bulbophyllum teretifolium is an epiphytic herb with pseudobulbs long and wide. Unique to the genus, the leaves are cylindrical in shape, long and about wide. Between 19 and 37 white and purplish pink flowers are borne on a thin flowering stem long, each flower on a pedicel (including the ovary) long. The dorsal sepal is oval, long, about long and slightly warty, the lateral sepals long and about wide. The petals are about long and less than wide. The labellum is about long and long and has three lobes. Taxonomy and naming Bulbophyllum teretifolium was first formally described in 1905 by Rudolf Schlechter and the description was published in Botanische Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie. The specific epithet (teretifolium) is from derived from the Latin words teres meaning \\"rounded\\" and folium meaning \\"a leaf\\". In 2004, Phillip Cribb and Benedict John Pollard reported on the discovery of a single epiphyte that Pollard had discovered in 2002 on one small, cultivated mango tree (Mangifera indica), in a private garden in Nyasoso (at elev. 830 m), Mount Kupe. They gave it the name Bulbophyllum kupense. It is the only one ever recorded, and it is still living. However, it is highly probable that this is not the only example of this species, which likely occurs somewhere in the forests on and around Mount Kupe. A plan by the interested parties (Pollard, Cribb and others) to propagate a small part of the plant that was removed, is now underway. Pollard had observed that the garden that surrounds the plant's host has been fenced, affording it better-than-nothing protection. Bulbophyllum kupense is regarded as a synonym of B. teretifolium by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families.

The club started playing in the amateur Prima divisione before moving up to the Promozione after one season, staying there until 1980-81. Playing one season in Serie D, the side then was promoted to the Serie C2 where it would play from 1982 to 1986 after which it joined the Serie B2. It won the league on its first try, moving up to the highest amateur division, the Serie B1, where it would stay for eight years. At the end of the 1994-95 season, Andrea Costa won a promotion to the professional Serie A2. The 1996-97 would see Imola beat favourites Livorno in the promotion playoffs and reach the Serie A. Under the leadership of Vincenzo Esposito, the side reached the playoffs in 1998-99, losing in the quarterfinals to rivals Fortitudo Bologna. The club managed to qualify for European competitions in 1999-2000 (Koraƒá Cup) and 2000-01 (Saporta Cup) but would be relegated at the end of 2001. The next decade was more difficult for Imola, with the club relegated thrice on the court (2004, 2007, 2009) before being saved by other club's bankruptcies. Arena Andrea Costa played in the PalaRuggi until 1995, with the promotion to the Serie A2 meaning the side had to find a suitable arena, moving to the Palatenda. Another promotion to the Serie A in 1998, meant the side had to move again, this time to the PalaCattani in neighbouring Faenza.

Description The evergreen tree typically grows to a height of and usually produces a clear trunk. It is moderately to long- lived, usually over 15 years with a moderate growth rate. It is dioecious with male and female flowers on separate plants, which flowers in spring. It is known as having the hardest wood in the world, with a Janka hardness of 5060 lbf. The cladodes are long with 10 to 14 teeth. They are sometimes waxy, of slightly greater diameter near their apex than their base. Distribution The species occurs across a vast region of eastern and southern Australia, mainly north and west of the Great Dividing Range, within the Murray-Darling Basin, and within the states of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. Its extent of occurrence has been greatly depleted by clearing for cereal cropping and pasture development. It is an important food resource for the endangered southeastern subspecies of the red-tailed black cockatoo in the Wimmera region of western Victoria, where some remnant stands are threatened by farming practices It grows on a range of soil types, mainly sandy loams, and is usually found on lower parts of the landscape. It tolerates acid, alkaline and moderately saline soils. The Shire of Buloke in Victoria, Australia is named after this tree species. Classification The species was first formally described as Casuarina luehmannii in 1900 by the botanist Richard Thomas Baker in the paper On two new species of Casuarina in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. It was subsequently reclassified in the Allocasuarina genus by Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson in 1985 in the Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens.

There were three prototype models, based on the 1997 Explorer XLT, which when viewed closely, has distinct characteristics apart from the production models (rear hatch design, taillights, and integrated license plate into the rear bumper). The Saleen XP8 comes in two wheel drive, or all wheel drive four-door configurations, packing either a 5.0-liter V-8, or a Saleen-developed supercharged 5.0-liter/286-horsepower V-8. A six-cylinder version, the Saleen XP6, was also made in very limited quantities in 1998.  Production quantities  There were approximately 265 Saleen XP8's created, although this number is widely disputed and to an extent, impossible to verify as Saleen has extremely limited records of this low production model. It has been said that approximately the first 20 XP8's were reserved for Saleen employees and executives, thus decreasing the available selection to the public even more.  Specifications  Saleen lowered the Explorer about 2 inches, for both improved handling and appearance. Springs and shocks were replaced with the company's Racecraft components, and wheels upgraded to Saleen's own genuine magnesium wheels wrapped by Pirelli 255/55SR18 Scorpion S/T radials. The exterior appearance package was designed by Phil Frank and includes special front and rear fascia, side skirts, door cladding, roof-mounted rear wing, and carbon fiber trim. The cabin is treated to either a real wood or carbon fiber appearance package, depending upon color choice, as well as Saleen gauge faces and floor mats.

Many of the options available in Saleen XP8's, such as the carbon fiber composite hood, Saleen supercharger, and carbon fiber accents were installed outside of the Saleen Inc. compound.  Availability  Saleen XP8's are now well past their final production date (2001), and as such, can only be purchased through online advertisements and car auction websites such as eBay Motors. Prices vary significantly due to condition, mileage, and most importantly, options installed. Sale prices can vary between $8,000 to $20,000 depending on the above. Additionally, all performance and appearance parts for the XP8's have ceased production back in 2001. Parts are virtually impossible to find and purchase, and reproduction costs are skyhigh due to low demand and basically, the owner of the vehicle themselves footing the bill. Saleen XP8 parts are no longer available through Saleen whatsoever, even to owners. This has led to what some owners describe as the \\"glass-slipper effect\\", as that if any substantial damage were to occur, replacement parts are not an option. Therefore, because of this and the very low production numbers to begin with of the XP8, the XP8 maintains a distinct allure to Ford enthusiasts unfound in many other vehicles.  Records  The Saleen Book, an official book produced by Saleen detailing the history and production numbers of Saleen vehicles past and present, noticeably neglected to cover and feature the XP8. Only in the owner registry listed in the book (compiled information of the original owner of each Saleen vehicle) did it mention a few select XP8's. As such, the Saleen Explorer XP6/XP8 Owner Registry Database was created on ExplorerX, an active Ford Explorer enthusiast website to maintain records. Although unofficial, it remains the only and most active list dedicated to Saleen XP6 and XP8 vehicles. An active XP6 and XP8 community resides there.

He would go on to win 14 PBA Tour titles, including a record three PBA Tournament of Champions titles in 1972, 1982, and 1984World Tournament of Champions History, at www.hickoksports.com (since matched by Jason Couch in 1999, 2000 and 2002 and Jason Belmonte in 2014, 2015 and 2019). Durbin also finished runner-up at the 1977 Tournament of Champions. He earned over $800,000 in his PBA career. Durbin was inducted into the PBA Hall of Fame in 1984. During the 1983-84 season, Durbin served as the president of the PBA. From the early 1980s to 1995, Durbin worked as a color analyst for ESPN alongside play-by- play man Dennis Schreiner. The two called tournaments in the summer and fall, along with senior tour events, while ABC Sports would cover the winter-spring events on the Pro Bowlers Tour, occasionally with Durbin alongside Chris Schenkel. Durbin would occasionally call the ESPN action himself with another analyst, such as Earl Anthony, if Schreiner was out on assignment. Durbin also worked as a commentator for USA Network's occasional bowling telecasts in the 1980s. In 1996, Marshall Holman became the new color analyst for ESPN's coverage, while Durbin took over play-by-play duties. Durbin retired from broadcasting in 1997. Durbin co-authored with Dan Herbst a self-help bowling book called From Gutterballs to Strikes published in 1998. Durbin lived in Dayton, Ohio, in the early 1970s. A long-time resident of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, Durbin also lived in Boulder City, Nevada; Henderson, Nevada; and then in several communities in Texas, most recently Livingston.

She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. Construction Alcona was laid down as the unnamed Maritime Commission contract hull, MC hull 2102, on 27 November 1943, at Richmond, California, by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Co.; named Alcona by the Navy and designated AK-157 on 25 February 1944; launched on 9 May 1944 and sponsored by Mrs. Morris Chamberlain of Oakland, California, transferred there by the Maritime Commission to the Navy on 15 September 1944, and commissioned the same day, Lieutenant Lester J. Lavine, USNR, in command. Alcona then shifted to the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, to be fitted out. Service history =World War II Pacific Theatre operations= Following shakedown training out of San Pedro, California, Alcona reported by dispatch, for duty with Service Squadron 7 on 22 October 1944 the same day that she sailed for San Francisco, California. Arriving there on the 23d, Alcona took on board cargo and got underway on the last day of October to commence operations supplying American advanced bases in New Guinea and later, in the Philippines which would keep her occupied for the rest of the war. New Guinea operations Pausing briefly at Pearl Harbor on 10 and 11 November, Alcona then continued, via Finschhafen, New Guinea, to Manus where she arrived on 29 November. After discharging her cargo, Alcona then proceeded via Hollandia, New Guinea, to Mios Woendi, in the Padaido Islands, where she spent Christmas before getting underway on 27 December for Australia. From Australia to the Philippines Alcona reached Brisbane, Australia, on 4 January 1945 and loaded cargo there until the 10th when she weighed anchor to head for the advanced base at Milne Bay, New Guinea. Upon emptying her hold there and at Finschhafen, the cargo ship then proceeded to Torokina, Bougainville, in the Solomons to pick up a mine unit for transportation to the Philippines. Arriving at Cape Torokina on 27 January, the ship got underway, via Hollandia, for Leyte the following morning and arrived at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 12 February. Underway for Manus on the 24th Alcona arrived in the Admiralties on 3 March and loaded cargo there before getting underway for Brisbane on the 11th. Although a typhoon hindered the ship's passage, she reached her destination without mishap on the 18th. Subsequently, Alcona returned to the Philippines and entered Manila Bay on 24 April. En route back, she touched at Seeadler Harbor, Manus, and Humboldt Bay, New Guinea, before reaching Hollandia to reload. Upon arrival back in the Philippines, Alcona discharged her cargo into tank landing craft (LCT's) off the former American naval base at Cavite. After discharging more cargo at Subic Bay on 17 May, at Guiuan Samar, the same day, and at San Pedro Bay, Alcona visited Brisbane for the third time in mid-June. End-of-war operations Alcona had transported another consignment of cargo to the Philippines by mid-July and had completed her task at Subic Bay by 8 August, two days after the first atomic bomb had been dropped on the city of Hiroshima. Underway for Samar on the 12th, Alcona arrived three days later and was lying at anchor off Samar the day that Japan capitulated, 15 August 1945. =Post-war operations= Alcona conducted another voyage from Brisbane to the Philippines and then, after undergoing repairs in the advanced base sectional floating drydock , proceeded to Samar on 12 November. Alcona remained there until she sailed for Panama on 19 January 1946. Transfer to the Atlantic Reaching Balboa on 3 March, Alcona entered the Panama Canal that afternoon and reached Cristobal on the Atlantic side of the isthmus, at 23:40. Underway for Norfolk, Virginia, on the morning of 7 March, Alcona proceeded toward her destination until rerouted to New York on the 12th. She anchored in Gravesend Bay, New York, on the 16th but got underway for Bayonne, New Jersey, 10 days later. The cargo ship reached the wharf at the naval base annex there that afternoon. After discharging cargo brought from the Pacific and loading new cargo, Alcona got underway for Norfolk on the morning of 13 April and anchored in Hampton Roads the following morning. Underway at 14:05 on the 19th, the ship reached Pier 4, Berth 42, Naval Operating Base (NOB), Norfolk, Virginia, at 14:45 to discharge cargo. Securing from alI cargo operations on the afternoon of the 24th, she steamed out into Hampton Roads and anchored until the morning of 1 May, when she got underway for Boston, Massachusetts. Exercise \\"Nanook\\" Initially, it had been planned to decommission Alcona at Norfolk so that she might be returned to the War Shipping Administration and laid up in the James River to await further disposition. However, on 18 April 1946, Captain Richard H. Cruzen, prospective commanding officer of an Arctic exercise, code named \\"Nanook\\" requested that Alcona be assigned to his task force. The approval of his request prolonged the ship's naval career and, on 27 April the Chief of Naval Operations ordered her assigned to \\"Nanook\\". Alcona arrived at Boston, Massachusetts, shortly before noon on 3 May and moored alongside the destroyer, . Five days later, Captain Robert J. Esslinger (who had won a Navy Cross in and a Silver Star for command of off Okinawa in 1945) relieved Lieutenant Commander H. D. Byington, USNR, in command. Initially, \\"Nanook\\" had been conceived as a small operation involving only an ice-strengthened rescue tug (ATR) and an icebreaker. Later, however, as the scope of operations expanded to encompass the establishment of advanced weather stations in the Canadian Arctic and in Greenland, it became evident that an increased lift capability was called for. For the remainder of May and into June, Alcona was prepared at the Boston Navy Yard for her \\"Arctic service of indefinite duration\\". Following her sea trials on 25 June, Alcona moored at Castle Island, in Boston Harbor, for final preparations. During her time at Boston, Task Force (TF) 68-consisting of , , Alcona, , , and , was activated on 15 June for \\"Nanook\\". As \\"Nanook\\" began, Northwind, Whitewood, and Atule proceeded north in mid-July, followed shortly thereafter by Norton Sound and Beltrami. Finally, after being held at Boston to load delayed supplies for the Weather Bureau, Alcona, the last ship of the \\"Nanook\\" force to get underway, sailed at 13:10 on 18 July for Greenland. Task Force 68 was now at sea; and, as Capt. Cruzen later reported, \\". . . an unusual force it was, too: one seaplane tender, one icebreaker, one submarine, one net tender converted into an icebreaker, and two cargo vessels.\\" Eight days later, as Alcona was steaming across Baffin Bay, she received orders to proceed to Thule, unescorted. Favorable ice conditions and good visibility made the passage possible and enabled Alcona to anchor in North Star Bay, off Thule, at 19:28 on 27 July. Despite the descent of a dense, pea-soup fog that hampered the operation of boats to transfer cargo ashore and, later, a brisk offshore breeze, Alconas discharge of cargo and heavy equipment proceeded apace and made it possible for the Army's 1887th Engineer Aviation Battalion to commence work on the airstrip planned for Thule. Meanwhile, Alconas Captain Esslinger was proving to be an able diplomat, smoothing the waters disturbed by the American \\"landings\\" on Greenland's soil. Esslinger's tact and diplomacy encouraged cordial relations with the people of the gigantic island and convinced them that there was no cause for alarm. Alcona completed unloading by 19 August, and the Weather Bureau personnel who had been embarked soon took up quarters ashore. The construction work had proceeded well by that time; and, on 28 August, Captain Esslinger reported to the task force commander that of runway had been completed and that the field could now take C-42 traffic, estimating that the field would be complete by mid-September. On the 22d, Alcona had helped cement American-Danish ties when the Royal Danish Navy surveying tender Ternan ran aground on the rocks at the entrance to North Star Bay at 03:25. One of the cargo ships' landing craft, an LCM, pulled Ternan off without difficulty. Soon thereafter, the Army construction crews, together with members of the small Naval Construction Battalion (CB) detachment, helped Danish carpenters in moving cement and lumber from Thule to the building site nearby. Ternan, apparently in North Star Bay to ascertain American intentions in the area, found nothing \\"out of order\\" in the activities going on there and departed North Star Bay shortly after mid-day on 24 August. However, a bit before midnight, lookouts sighted Ternan preparing to reenter North Star Bay. She soon ran aground again; and a boat arrived alongside Alcona, bringing a Danish lieutenant who requested a doctor and a pharmacist's mate to help a wounded Danish seaman who had suffered a 12-gauge shotgun wound in the head. Brought on board for treatment, the seaman immediately underwent an emergency operation on board Alcona and responded well to the surgery. Alconas doctor then told the Danish vessel's commanding officer, a Commander Tegner, that the man could not be moved for at least four days. When Tegner remonstrated that he had to return to Godthaab posthaste, Captain Esslinger assured the Danish officer that if no other means of transportation could be provided, Alcona would return the man to Godthaab or to any other convenient Greenland port while en route to the United States. The Danish commander accepted Esslinger's offer gratefully. However, toward the end of August, ice conditions around Thule harbor became a grave concern while Alcona was underway for soundings on 31 August and on 2 and 4 September. After the arrival of the Coast Guard buoy tender on 2 September, Alcona assisted in unloading cargo and disembarking Danish weathermen from her and, with the American airstrip and weather station nearing completion, began reloading excess equipment and cargo handling machinery for return to Boston. With the airstrip finished 10 days ahead of schedule, Alcona was ready for sea by 6 September but remained at North Star Bay to be able to assist the Danish schooner North Star, slated to arrive within days. Alcona was not forced to tarry long, for the awaited North Star reached Thule on schedule. Alcona immediately turned to help unload weather station equipment and building materials, completing the task by noon on 10 September. Underway in company with Northwind at 13:00 on the 10th, both ships stood clear of the fjord, and headed south. The \\"Nanook\\" historian recorded the scene graphically: \\"The weather was fine, very clear and only a wisp of breeze. Very fittingly for our last look at the northward, the whole area from the mouth of North Star Bay to several miles down Melville Bay was cluttered with thousands of big icebergs. Sparkling in the sunlight they were a striking sight.\\" Three hours after their departure, the two ships parted company, Alcona proceeding to Arsuk to disembark the wounded, but recovering, Danish seaman. En route, however, Alcona ran into a severe storm that swept across Davis Strait on 12 September. She suffered the least of the three ships caught in the gale, Whitewood was forced to heave to in heavy seas for 36 hours in winds that sometimes reached ; Northwind rolled and pitched, giving all hands a rough ride. Although the storm put Alcona a day behind her schedule, she reached Arsuk Fjord without mishap on 15 September and that morning transferred Quartermaster Richard B. Anderson, Royal Danish Navy, to , off Simiutak Island. A Danish surgeon subsequently sent a dispatch to the Navy expressing his appreciation for the \\"outstanding brain surgery and exceptional medical job performed\\" by Alconas doctor. Ultimately, Alcona reached President Roads, Boston, early in the evening of 20 September, the last ship of \\"Nanook\\" to return home. Greenland service Departing Boston to load cargo at Bayonne between 15 and 18 October 1946, Alcona sailed for Argentia, Newfoundland, and arrived there on the 22d. The ship made another voyage to Greenland, discharging cargo at Narsarsuaq, 12 to 20 December, and Gr√∏nnedal, 21 to 23 December, and then spent Christmas of 1946 at sea, bound for Argentia, which she reached on the 29th. She subsequently got underway for Bayonne on New Year's Day, 1947. Atlantic Ocean service After a brief stint of repairs at Norfolk, Alcona returned to the familiar waters of Bayonne and New York City in late January 1947. From Bayonne, she carried out a busy schedule of cargo-carrying operations as a unit of the Atlantic Fleet's Service Force through the summer of 1947, numbering Argentia; St. John's, Newfoundland; Bermuda; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Guant√°namo Bay as her ports of call. Interspersed were voyage repairs at Boston or Bayonne and a tender availability alongside the repair ship at Newport, 3 to 20 June 1947. =SS York incident= That fall, she suffered the only mishap of her career. Underway on 22 October 1947 from the Naval Ammunition Depot at Leonardo, N.J., the ship reached the Naval Supply Depot, Norfolk, on the evening of the 23d and then shifted to an anchorage where, between 10:00 and 14:53 on 24 October, she took on board a cargo of ammunition from an ammunition lighter moored alongside. Underway shortly after noon on the following day, Alcona was proceeding to San Juan, Puerto Rico, when, at 01:40, she collided with the Pacific Tanker Line's vessel, SS York. The two ships struck bow to bow at about a 60-degree angle. Alcona sounded the general alarm. The ships soon parted but then struck again, the unidentified ship's stern scraping the cargo vessel's starboard quarter. Alconas executive officer promptly reported to the bridge that the ship's starboard bow had been torn leaving a hole from frame four port to frame nine, between the first and second decks, and that the starboard anchor was missing. York reported a large hole in her port bow just aft of the anchor and that the damage extended below her waterline. Her stern was also badly dented. Alcona asked if the latter required assistance, but the merchantman's master replied that his ship was seaworthy and would proceed to New York unless Alcona required help. About 03:23, \\"after determining that the extent of damage was such that it was safe to proceed,\\" Alcona moved slowly ahead, shaping course for Norfolk, with a watch on the foc'sle to take soundings in the ship's number one hold every 15 minutes. Survey parties had found that the ammunition cargo, except for two bombs which had gone adrift, was safe. A chief boatswain's mate and a working party soon secured the way ward bombs. At 17:09 that evening, Alcona moored at NOB, Norfolk, at the naval supply depot. Return to service ‚Äì Transatlantic voyage After repairs at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard that included a drydocking from 5 to 26 November, Alcona got underway for Charleston, South Carolina, on 29 November and entered the navy yard at that port on 1 December. The ship underwent further repairs there that lasted into March 1948. She then conducted her first transatlantic cargo-carrying voyage, getting underway from Norfolk on the afternoon of 25 March 1948. During the course of her cruise, she touched at Valletta, Malta, 14 to 19 April; Port Miseno, Italy, 20 to 22 April; and Naples, Italy, 22 to 24 April; before calling at Casablanca, French Morocco, 29 to 5 May, on the voyage back to Norfolk, Virginia, which she reached on 18 May. Atlantic service Departing Norfolk on 6 July after operating locally in the waters of the Tidewater region, Alcona sailed for Earle, New Jersey, reaching that destination the following day to load a cargo of explosives and pyrotechnic materials. Sailing on 30 July, Alcona. subsequently discharged her cargo at Trinidad, British West Indies, 8 to 28 August; and at Coco Solo, 17 to 25 September, before arriving back at Leonardo, New Jersey, on 3 October. The ship made one more voyage, from Leonardo to Argentia and discharged her cargo from 29 November to 7 December. Returning to Norfolk on 13 December, Alcona spent the remainder of 1948 in that port. Over the following years, Alconas routine varied little from what had gone before. Besides ranging from Bermuda to Argentia and from Guantanamo Bay to the Panama Canal Zone, she made a second transatlantic voyage to carry cargo to Casablanca in the autumn of 1950. During the nine years that the ship operated in the Atlantic, she made over 40 round-trip voyages with cargo to support fleet operations from Thule to Trinidad and from Argentia to Eleuthera. Final decommissioning Alcona was decommissioned 5 May 1955, she was struck from the Naval Register on 1 April 1960. She was laid up as part of the Charleston Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet from the time she was decommissioned until she was sold.

Plot The film follows the actions of a corrupt police captain, the title- character √Ångel Lugo, performed by Braulio Castillo, hijo. Lugo is responsible for the wrongful imprisonment of Mariano Far√≠as (Morales) and the murder of his pregnant wife (Sara Jarque). After 15 years in a federal prison, Far√≠as is still determined to prove his innocence. For that, he recruits the help of Juan Miranda, the district attorney that originally prosecuted him, who is now a retired alcoholic. Meanwhile, Lugo is still trying to keep his involvement in Far√≠as' case and other wrongdoings under wraps. To accomplish it, he bribes his accomplice Villanueva (Jos√© F√©lix G√≥mez) into helping him. Villanueva is now having second thoughts about his involvement and only wants to protect his wife and grandson. Involved in everything is a female reporter, Julia Norat (Yamaris Latorre), who receives exclusive information from Lugo and has also become his lover. However, upon meeting Far√≠as, Norat is quickly charmed by him.

The genus Buxus has about 70 species of evergreen shrubs and trees found in habitats ranging from rocky hills to woodlands. The general characteristics of Buxus are small simple leaves, entire or toothed, alternately arranged or opposite on the stems. The wood is very firm and close grained, and is used for wood engraving and musical instruments. It has a yellowish color, very rarely splits, and has a good natural polish. Buxus obtusifolia is sometimes known as hutch. Buxus refers to the box or hardwood that can be obtained from the bark of Buxaceae plants. The family Buxaceae ranges from regions in Europe, Africa, Asia, Central America to the Caribbean. Buxaceae plants are perennial, living for more than two years before they die.

It is endemic to Australia. Description The small perennial herb or sub-shrub has many branches and typically grows to a height of in height. It is a tall leafy plant with the leaf bases closely spaced. It has deep, woody perennial rootstock that the plant is able to resprout from the rhizomes after fire. It blooms between September and January producing pink-purple and white flowers. It has three nerved sepals and forms an obtuse subglobose shaped capsule with many faint nerves. The seeds have highly corrugated and ribbed sculptured plates. Seeds have a length of and a width of with shallow transverse ridges. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist John Lindley in 1839 as part of the work A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. The only known synonym is Byblis lindleyana as described by Jules √âmile Planchon in 1848. The type specimen was collected by James Drummond in 1839 from around the Swan River. The specific epithet is taken from the Latin word giganteus meaning giant referring to the larger size of this species compared to Byblis liniflora. B. gigantea is closely related to Byblis lamellata but they have different seed morphology. Distribution It has a scattered distribution from the Wheatbelt region around Dandaragan in the north down through the suburbs of Perth, Western Australia on the Swan Coastal Plain and into the Darling Range then south as far as Boddington in the Peel region. The plant is often found in and around swamps and seasonally wet areas growing in sandy peaty soils and is usually part of low Leptospermum and Restionaceae dominated shrubland communities. Conservation status The species was listed a Critically Endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list in 2000. In 2002 the species was listed as a \\"Priority Two\\" flora, mostly as a result of it being absent over much of its former range due to urban expansion throughout the Perth metropolitan area. Cultivation B. gigantea prefers drier conditions than most sundews. It grows well in large pots containing a very sandy soil mix and is top-watered only. These plants are prone to fungal death until they become established. To germinate the seeds for this plant gibberellic acid treatment or pot fire treatment may be required. The age of the seeds is not important, seeds over 22 years of age have germinated after fire treatment.

She loaded cargo and ammunition at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, then sailed for Eniwetok on 11 January 1945. The ship reached Eniwetok on the 29th and was routed on to Ulithi. Upon her arrival there on 18 February, Amador was assigned to Service Squadron 10. = Delivering ammunition to the Philippines = Amador remained at Ulithi through 15 March for ammunition handling operations. She next set sail on the 16th for Leyte, Philippines, via Kossol Roads. The ship anchored in San Pedro Bay on 22 March and began issuing ammunition to ships of the fleet, as well as reworking defective projectiles and fuses. On 23 October, she moved to Guinan Roadstead, Samar, and began receiving ammunition from ammunition lighters for transportation back to the United States. =Post-war decommissioning= On 12 November, Amador got underway for Seattle, Washington. She arrived in Puget Sound on 8 December and remained in that area until 29 March 1946, when she began preparations for deactivation. She was decommissioned on 20 June 1946, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 19 July 1946. The ship was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 23 July 1946.

The action of norfenfluramine on 5-HT2B receptors on heart valves leads to a characteristic pattern of heart failure following proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts on the tricuspid valve, known as cardiac fibrosis.

It was discovered in 1977 by the pharmacologists Le Fur and Uzan at Pharmuka, a small French pharmaceutical firm, who credit Baron Shopsin and his colleagues at NYU-Bellevue/NYU School of Medicine in New York with providing the basis for their work. They were particularly influenced by the series of \\"synthesis inhibitor studies\\" carried out by Shopsin's team during the early to mid 1970s, and in particular, the clinical report by Shopsin et al. (1976) relating to PCPA's rapid reversal of antidepressant response to tranylcypromine in depressed patients. This led to an understanding of the role of the monoamine neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5HT) in the therapeutic effects of the available tricyclic and MAOI class antidepressants. The studies led to widespread recognition of a serotonin hypothesis of depression, contradicting theories that promoted the role of norepinephrine. History While citalopram and zimelidine were developed in the early 1970s, it was Pharmuka's indalpine that was first to reach the market. Baron Shopsin was recruited as consultant to Pharmuka throughout a research and development process that resulted in the marketing of indalpine in France and then worldwide, in 1982. With FDA approval of Pharmuka's IND submission to conduct clinical studies with indalpine and viqueline, Shopsin carried out and published the first clinical trials with these drugs in depressed outpatients in the U.S. Astra's SSRI zimelidine was marketed within a year (1983), but the next crop of SSRIs didn't become commercially available until the 1986 marketing of fluvoxamine in Belgium by Duphar, followed by approval in the United States later that year. Lilly's fluoxetine (Prozac) was approved in the US in 1987. Meanwhile, zimelidine had been withdrawn soon after its marketing in 1983 due to the emergence of Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, a serious neurological disease. With lingering concerns among some Common Market countries and activist groups about the potential of SSRIs to induce adverse effects, and the reported association between indalpine and hematological effects, which emerged in the aftermath of Pharmuka's take over by Rh√¥ne Poulenc, indalpine was abruptly taken off the market by Rh√¥ne Poulenc. Irish psychiatrist David Healy characterized indalpine as being \\"born at the wrong time\\" during a period when \\"indalpine and psychiatry was under siege\\" by different interest groups in some of the Common Market countries.

The FAT was an artillery tractor of the British and Commonwealth forces during World War II. Several models were produced by the two manufactures as CGT (Chevrolet Gun Tractor) and FGT (Ford Gun Tractor). The early 'Quad' bodywork, parading in Tripoli in February 1943 CMP stood for Canadian Military Pattern and was applied to a number of trucks, artillery tractors and utility vehicles built in Canada that combined British design requirements with North American automotive engineering.Bart Vanderveen (1989) 'Historic Military Vehicles Directory'. P. 40 As with other FATs, the CMP was usually used to tow either the 25 pounder gun-howitzer or the 17 pounder anti-tank gun. A power winch was located above the rear axle for manoeuvring the gun or unbogging the vehicle. History Specification was based on the successful British Morris C8 FAT developed before the war, even incorporating right-hand-drive steering. The first models were produced in 1940/41 and the body went through a number of design changes throughout the war. Being based on the British vehicle, CMPs were used extensively by British and Commonwealth forces replacing lost stocks after the Dunkirk evacuation.

Plot summary  The story is set in the Smokehill National Park, a wildlife preserve for the preservation and study of dragons. The dragons are elusive; evidence of their existence can be found everywhere, but the dragons themselves remain hidden. Young Jake Mendoza, who lives with his father, the owner and director of the park, goes out for his first overnight solo and comes across a dying dragon. The dragon has been fatally injured by a poacher who has breached the security of the wildlife preserve. The fact that a dragon has killed a human, even a poacher, will make life very complicated for Smokehill National Park, which exists in a tough political climate, due to the controversial nature of keeping dragons alive. But what makes life even more complicated for Jake is that he discovers that the dying dragon had been a mother, and that one of her dragonlets is still alive. It is illegal to save the dragon's life, but Jake, having discovered the baby dragon, cannot leave it to die. He takes the dragon home and raises it. However, this creates a controversy. The family of the dead poacher want the dragons at Dragonhaven killed. Jake and the other rangers are trying their best to convince those against the preservation of dragons that the creatures are really peaceful and friendly. The bulk of the story involves Jake's growing relationship with the young dragon and other dragons, all the responsibilities that come along with caring for an orphaned wild animal, and his own maturation from child to young adult.

Her life has been a source of inspiration for many works in television, films, music, theater and literature. She is popularly known as the slave who became a queen.Para Conhecer Chica da Silva The myth of Chica da Silva is often conflated with the historical accounts of Francisca da Silva de Oliveira. Biography Francisca da Silva de Oliveira was a parda woman born in Vila do Pr√≠ncipe (nowadays Serro), in the north of the state of Minas Gerais, in Brazil between 1730 and 1735. Not unlike many other regions in Brazil, this region's population was mostly of African descent, with slaves outnumbering whites by a large margin.Robert Edward Conrad, \\"Children of God's Fire\\" People in the town made a living either through gold or diamond mining. Francisca lived mainly in Arraial do Tijuco (nowadays known as Diamantina) and was the daughter of a Portuguese man, Ant√¥nio Caetano de S√° and an enslaved African woman, Maria da Costa, who was probably from the Gulf of Guinea or Bahia. The region of Minas Gerais was unique in that it had a fairly diverse population in comparison to other slave regions on the Brazilian coast, Caribbean, and the United States. Known as \\"Francisca parda\\" while enslaved, Francisca's first owner was Domingos da Costa, who was from Milho Verde. After Costa, Francisca was sold to Sergeant Manuel Pires Sardinha, with whom she had her first son, Sim√£o Pires Sardinha.J√∫nia Ferrera Furtado, \\"Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century.\\" Although Sardinha listed Sim√£o as one of his heirs, Sardinha never officially declared paternity of Sim√£o.J√∫nia Ferrera Furtado, \\"Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century.\\" Francisca's third master was Jo√£o Fernandes de Oliveira, a diamond mine owner and mining Governor of Arraial do Tijuco, one of the richest persons of Colonial Brazil. Because Francisca later added \\"da Silva\\" as a surname, it is often incorrectly concluded that she was once owned by a Jos√© da Silva de Olivera. The name, however, was very common among the Portuguese at the time and offered a fresh start.J√∫nia Ferrera Furtado, \\"Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century.\\" Sources suggest that Francisca was granted her freedom, either by Jos√© da Silva de Oliveira at the request of Jo√£o Fernandes or that she was given her freedom directly by Jo√£o Fernandes when he bought her from Pires Sardinha in 1753. After being granted her freedom, Chica officially changed her name to Francisca da Silva de Oliveira in order to erase her history as a slave. This was hugely beneficial for her son Sim√£o Pires Sardinia who later in life was able hide his mothers slave ancestry and his status of being an illegitimate son in order to receive the prestigious Portuguese title, the knight of the Order of Christ. Francisca and Jo√£o soon started a relationship. Despite not being officially married, they lived together for several years and had 13 children: Francisca de Paula (1755); Jo√£o Fernandes (1756); Rita (1757); Joaquim (1759); Antonio Caetano (1761); Ana (1762); Helena (1763); Luiza (1764); Ant√¥nia (1765); Maria (1766); Quit√©ria Rita (1767); Mariana (1769); Jos√© Agostinho Fernandes (1770). Soon after, Chica became an independent owner of a house in Tejuco on Opera Street. The house was adorned with many luxuries including an extensive garden, her own personal chapel, and furniture like bathtubs, armoires, mirrors and canopy beds, that were rare to households at the time. Chica was also the owner of many slaves who both helped her in the house and worked in the mines in the region. Chica also presented herself in a very ostentatious manner in order to help differentiate herself from the other mixed people in society. People often showed their status through their material items, which for Chica included her clothing, home, slaves, and change in name. By the end of her life she also included Dona at the beginning of her name for a more prestigious title. In 1770, Jo√£o Fernandes had to return to Portugal and took along with him the 4 sons he had with Chica as well as Chica's two other sons Placid Pires Sardinha and Sim√£o Pires Sardinha, whom were granted noble titles by the Portuguese Court. Their daughters remained with Chica in Brazil and were sent to then renowned Convent of Maca√∫bas. Even after the departure of Jo√£o to Portugal, Chica retained her prestige. She was a member of the S√£o Francisco do Carmo Brotherhood (exclusive to whites), Merc√™s Brotherhood (exclusive to mulattos) and of Ros√°rio Brotherhood (exclusive to Africans). Chica da Silva died in 1796. She was buried at the Church of S√£o Francisco de Assis, a privilege that only wealthy whites enjoyed. Gender in Colonial Brazil In eighteenth century Brazil, colonizers and slaves were both overwhelmingly male. Portuguese men had traveled to Brazil alone to seek wealth, as Portuguese women were often banned from migrating.Edward E. Telles, \\"Race in Another America,\\" Princeton University Press (2004). In part due to love affairs and children born between Portuguese men and African and/or mulatta slave women, freed former slaves were predominately female.J√∫nia Ferreira Furtado, \\"Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century,\\" Cambridge University Press (2009), 15 Stereotypes about non-white women were abundant during the colonial period and while gender, race and color worked together to systemically disadvantage negro women, some individuals‚Äîsuch as Chica‚Äîused their perceived hyper-sensuality to invert gender and power relations.J√∫nia Ferrera Furtado, \\"Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century,\\" Cambridge University Press (2009). Once socially mobile, these women were seen as even more dominant than their masters.Ibid. The myth Chica's legacy was often misused to symbolize Brazil's so called \\"racial democracy.\\"J√∫nia Ferrera Furtado, \\"Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century,\\" Cambridge University Press (2009). Currently, however, scholars maintain that she used miscegenation and her connections as a tool to achieve a higher social status, as did other African Brazilians at the time. Historian J√∫nia Ferreira Furtado sustains that concubinage and marriage between white male and black female in colonial Brazilian society was a way found by the enslaved to change their social position and to escape racism : Jo√£o Fernandes and Chica da Silva's relationship was a scandal in colonial Brazilian society. Chica da Silva, formerly enslaved, had become one of the most powerful women in colonial America. Chica was banished from the parish church, which was reserved for Caucasians only. To show the locals Chica's power, Jo√£o Fernandes built a luxurious church attended just by herself. However, as Furtado discloses, Chica attended brotherhoods exclusive to whites, as a way to try to fit into the status quo and be aware of its schemes against her and her people. Contrary to what was propagated, Chica also owned slaves, and is only known to have freed one of them. Historians view this as the main difference between the experience of Africans in Brazil and their counterparts in the United States. While in the US, African-American former slaves had a more unified movement, in Brazil they tried to integrate into white society as mixed-race people saw that \\"whitening\\" themselves was a way to escape from their slave past. Although slaves didn't have any choice if the master or mistress decided to use them as sex objects, some were able to use the situation, especially in regard to their offspring who were part European. The colonial Portuguese mentality was also more tolerant than the US Anglo-Saxon one on race when it had to do with their mixed-race offspring. Whereas Anglo-Saxon slave holders forced their own race-mixed offspring into slavery and sold them to other masters as well, making a profit from them, Luso-Brazilians generally freed their own mixed-race children and often granted them nobility titles. This happened perhaps because of the lack of Portuguese women that migrated to Brazil.

He studied medicine at the University of Vienna and subsequently worked as an assistant to surgeon Eduard Albert (1841-1900) in Vienna. In 1901 he was one of the founders of the German Society of Orthopaedic Surgery. He was the father of famed ethologist Konrad Lorenz (1903-1989). Adolf Lorenz is remembered for his work with bone deformities. As a young surgeon during the 1880s, he developed a severe allergic skin reaction to carbolic acid, a compound that was used extensively in operating rooms. Although the condition prevented him from performing traditional surgical operations, he continued in the medical profession as a \\"dry surgeon\\", treating patients without cutting into skin or tissue. Subsequently, he was given the nickname \\"The Bloodless Surgeon of Vienna\\". His techniques became known as bloodless surgery, reflecting his noninvasive techniques. He was also a eugenicist who said that babies born prematurely should be left to die rather than develop spastic paralysis. He was renowned for his treatment of congenital dislocation of the hip in children. His technique involved putting the patient under light anesthesia, placing the child in a plaster spica cast in abduction, then using external rotation as the child matured. Also, he added a specialized walking frame to give the patient a measure of mobility. He created a manipulative treatment for club feet, a process that involved stretching or breaking the tendons, ligaments, and epiphyseal plates until the foot was properly aligned. Once alignment was achieved, he applied a cast so that the foot healed in the corrected position. Through the use of traction and pulleys, Lorenz developed a mechanism for treatment of scoliosis. Due to his fame in orthopedics, he became acquainted with several dignitaries, including U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. During his travels in the United States, he gave an inspirational exhibition in Dallas, an exhibition that became a catalyst in the creation of the Texas Baptist Memorial Sanitarium, later known as the Baylor University Medical Center and Baylor Health Care System.

The house was founded in 1956 by a grant from Thomas Gilchrist to form a memorial house at the university in memory of his close friend Baron Friedrich Sigismund von Cramm. Baron von Cramm was a lieutenant in the 16th Panzer Division of the Wehrmacht who was killed by a Soviet grenade near Mariupol, Ukraine on October 6, 1941. First occupied in September 1957, von Cramm Hall housed approximately 30 undergraduate upperclassmen chosen by Cornell's Dean of Men and the Director of Financial Aid. From that time onward new residents were chosen by housemembers themselves. Two members were compensated for their services: the Steward, in charge of menus and food purchases, and the House Manager (overall management of the building). Members shared house upkeep and food preparation duties. During the 1970s the house became a self-governing co-operative open also to women . Today the co-op continues to be an active and vocal part of the Cornell University community. It has a history of social action (for instance the Coop's recent involvement in the Redbud Woods protest) and openness with a rich tradition of welcoming people from all parts of the globe. As a result, Von Cramm attracts many international students and is unofficially seen as the \\"international cooperative\\". House traditions include banquets and house clean-ups.

Hensley (1859‚Äì1947), who purchased land at this site in January 1898. With his wife Maggie (1875‚Äì1960), he asked his brother, architect Henry Hensley, to design this house to catch breezes from any direction. Recorded Texas Historic Landmark 1993. Built in 1905 by the Alamo Lumber Company, the house is a fine local example of a Victorian-era residence and stylistic influences of the Queen Anne period. It features a distinctive cross-plan layout with octagonal shaped rooms, with porches providing additional spaces to complete the octagon. Because of its unusual floor plan, the house's central living room contains eight doors but no windows; four of the doors open onto the corner porches. Beautiful hart pine flooring and wood trim still exists throughout the home along with beautiful hart pine doors and transoms. Like many wooden structures in Bay City from the early 20th Century, the structure and exterior of the home is built from cypress lumber. Prominent features include a cross-gable roof with wood shingled gable ends, and decorative wood brackets at cutaway corners above corner windows. The original wooden porch floors were replaced with concrete in the 1930s, but the decorative wood columns and doors remain. Retail salesman James Robert Gusman (1862‚Äì1944), his wife Bettie Amanda Harrington (1864‚Äì1948) and their children moved to Bay City from Weimar in 1911. They bought the house from the Hensley's in 1919, and it remained in their family for generations. Recorded by the Texas Historic Landmark - 1993. In 2003, the Hensley‚ÄìGusman House was purchased by Timothy Sloan, a lifelong resident of Bay City and attorney at law, from the Bay City Historical Commission, as the home was left by the Gusman family. After extensive renovations, in August 2007, the Hensley‚ÄìGusman House became the new home for the law practice of Timothy Sloan, and son, Matthew Hardy Sloan. In 2016, Matthew Hardy Sloan inherited the home and in 2017 the home became a business office for Edward D. Jones, operated by James Scardami. As of 2019, the home is still owned by Mr. Sloan and maintains its Texas State Historical and National Register of Historical Places listings. On August 18, 2007, the home was dedicated by the Bay City mayor and local citizens as a National Historic Place. Some modifications have been made in accordance with the National Register of Historic Places in keeping with the historic nature of this property. All the floors, moldings, doors and windows have been refinished to the original wood finishes. Bedrooms have been furnished into the main lobby, law offices, legal assistant offices, law library and conference room. The kitchen retains its original location, with original cabinetry and updated appliances. The original bathroom has been modified with an addition of a second half-bath to make compliant.

It is used to describe states, that unlike revisionist states, see the international system of states, international law and often even free market economics as integral aspects of the international spectrum that should be upheld. Status-quo states strive to preserve things as they are, whereas revisionists seek to change things in international politics. When scholars categorize states as revisionist or status-quo seeking they are able to explain important outcomes in international politics, such as war and peace. Generally, there is a direct correlation between a state's hegemony, both political and economic and its standing as either a status quo state or a revisionist state.Power Transition Theory, summary. Richard W. Chadwick Powerful and influential nations in international relations such as the United Kingdom, France and other nations like Japan who have benefited from western liberalism, are likely to fall under the category of status quos states, while North Korea, Iran, and other nations dissatisfied with their place on the international stage are often considered revisionist states.  Characteristics of status-quo states  A system consisting mostly of status- quo states need not devolve into war. Moreover, if status-quo states recognize each other as such and are not threatened by each other, they should be confronted with fewer cooperation-inhibiting problems (e.g., relative gain concerns) than they would if they feared others' intentions. In The Origins of Revisionist and Status-Quo States, Davidson mentions that according to the neoclassical realist framework, it points toward \\"new facts\\", where they explain that periods of \\"concert\\" can occur when all or most states are committed to preserving the status quo. The author also explains this with the example of the Concert of Europethe Concert of Europe (1815-54) in which states were able to hold those norms and follow those rules because they were status-quo seekers and understood that their neighbors were also committed to the status quo. Revisionist and status-quo states have been the core of the history of international relations. As the history of great power war and peace may be seen as a series of clashes between revisionists and status-quo seekers. Moreover, status-quo states may ally with the most powerful state in the system if it is also a status-quo state, because they should not fear such a state and because they prefer to have defensive coalitions that are too large rather than too small.

In other words, the more skillfully or elegantly an idea is communicated, the more likely it is to be considered seriously, whether or not it is logical. Research Jacoby and Dallas (1981) found that if an object \\"jumps out\\" at a person and is readily perceived, then they have likely seen it before even if they do not consciously remember seeing it. As a proxy for real-world quantities: Hertwig et al. (2008) investigated whether retrieval fluency, like recognition, is a proxy for real-world quantities across five different reference classes in which they expected retrieval fluency to be effective. a) cities in the U.S with more than 100,000 inhabitants b) the 100 German companies with the highest revenue in 2003 c) the top 106 music artists in the U.S. in terms of cumulative sales of recordings from 1958 to 2003 d) the highest paid athletes of 2004 e) the 100 wealthiest people in the world Hertwig et al. measured response time latencies for participants presented with each object. The names of objects were presented in random order and participants were asked if they recognized each object. Hertwig et al. found that differences in recognition latencies are indicative of criteria across five different environments. The strength of the relationship varied across environments. Environments with low ecological validity such as the companies and music artists environments yielded low levels of fluency across five environments. The resulting data provides evidence for the idea that we can at least theoretically infer distal properties of the world. Are people able to exploit retrieval fluency? To exploit retrieval fluency, people need to be able to judge accurately whether recognizing object a's name takes longer than recognizing object b's name, or vice versa. Hertwig et al. investigated the extent to which people can accurately tell such differences apart. They observed three results: First, people prove to be quite good at discriminating between recognition latencies whose differences exceeds 100 ms. Second, even when taking less-than perfectly accurate discriminations into account, subjective fluency judgments are a moderately good predictor of the criterion, except in environments in which ecological validity of fluency information is too low to begin with (e.g. music artist's environment). Last, they found that people's ability to discriminate is highest for those pairs in which the validity of fluency peaks. Are people's inferences in line with the fluency heuristic? In about two thirds to three fourths of inferences in which the fluency heuristic was applicable, people's actual choices conformed to those predicted by the heuristic. Hertwig et al. also found that the larger the difference between recognition latencies (for two objects), the greater the likelihood that the actual inference adheres to that predicted by the fluency heuristic. Neural correlates of the fluency heuristic: Volz, Schooler, and von Cramon (2010) used functional magnetic resonance imaging to isolate fluency- heuristic-based judgments to map the use of fluency onto specific brain areas that might give a better understanding of the heuristic's underlying processes. They determined that there was activation within the claustrum for fluency heuristic decisions. Given that claustrum activation is thought to reflect the integration of perceptual and memory elements into a conscious gestalt, they suggest that activation correlates with the experience of fluency. The effect of repetition: Lloyd, Westerman, and Miller (2003) used five experiments to investigate whether the attribution of processing fluency to recognition memory depends on the amount of fluency that is expected from targets based on the frequency with which they appeared during an earlier study phase. Subjects studied targets either one or five times and then were given a recognition test that included a priming phase to enhance the fluency of half of the test items. Results showed that the priming phase had a greater influence on recognition responses when targets had been presented once than when they had been presented five times. However, an interaction between fluency and target frequency was found only when frequency was manipulated between-subjects. An interaction between the priming manipulation and target frequency was also found using a \\"counterfeit\\" manipulation of frequency, suggesting that attributions of fluency are adjusted according to subjects' expectations for the amount of fluency that should result from previous experiences with a stimulus.

Volunteers and civic leaders joined forces to continue opera in Atlanta. In 1979, the Atlanta Civic Opera was formed, a result of a merger between two competing entities, Atlanta Lyric Opera and Georgia Opera. The first artistic director was noted composer Thomas Pasatieri. In 1985, the company was renamed to The Atlanta Opera. The company's first production was La Traviata on March 28, 1980 at the Fox Theatre. The following December, a festive gala was held in Symphony Hall with such noted young artists as Catherine Malfitano, Jerry Hadley and Samuel Ramey. Atlanta Opera has a number of home venues: in 1990 it moved to the Atlanta Symphony Hall, in 1995 to the Fox Theatre, in 1998 to its own building, the Atlanta Opera Center at 728 West Peachtree St., in 2003 to the Boisfeuillet Jones Atlanta Civic Center,\\"Our History\\", The Atlanta Opera and finally in 2007, The Atlanta Opera moved into its new performance home at Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, just outside the city and county limits.

The familiarity heuristic was developed based on the discovery of the availability heuristic by psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman; it happens when the familiar is favored over novel places, people, or things. The familiarity heuristic can be applied to various situations that individuals experience in day-to-day life. When these situations appear similar to previous situations, especially if the individuals are experiencing a high cognitive load, they may regress to the state of mind in which they have felt or behaved before. This heuristic is useful in most situations and can be applied to many fields of knowledge; however, there are both positives and negatives to this heuristic as well. Origin =Availability heuristic= The familiarity heuristic stems from the availability heuristic, which was studied by Tversky and Kahneman. The availability heuristic suggests that the likelihood of events is estimated based on how many examples of such events come to mind. Thus the familiarity heuristic shows how \\"bias of availability is related to the ease of recall.\\"Ashcraft, M.H. (2006). Cognition. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey; Pearson Education Inc. Tversky and Kahneman created an experiment in order to test this heuristic. They devised four lists of 39 names. Each list contained 19 female names and 20 male names. Half of the lists had famous female names, and the other half had famous male names. They showed the lists to two test groups. The first group was shown a list and asked to recall as many names as possible. The second group was shown a list and asked to determine if there were more female or more male names. The subjects who heard the list with famous female names said there were more female names than there were male names. Similarly, the subjects who heard the list with famous male names recalled more male names than female names. Thus the familiarity heuristic is defined as \\"judging events as more frequent or important because they are more familiar in memory.\\" The familiarity heuristic is based on using schemas or past actions as a scaffold for behavior in a new (yet familiar) situation. This is useful because it saves time for the subject who is trying to figure out the appropriate behavior for a situation they have experienced before. Individuals automatically assume that their previous behavior will yield the same results when a similar situation arises. This technique is typically useful. However, certain behaviors can be inappropriate when the situation is different from the time before. =Hindsight bias= The hindsight bias is the inclination to see events that have already occurred as being more predictable than they were before they took place. For example, after a situation occurs for the first time, you begin to notice it when it reoccurs and therefore because you have now experienced it, it's more readily available in your consciousness and you pull information and predict aspects of the future because of this and think that you \\"knew it all along.\\" \\"Hindsight bias results from a biased reconstruction of the original memory trace, using the outcome as a cue\\" Hindsight bias can alter memories and therefore future predictions. Important research Recent studies have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to demonstrate that people use different areas of the brain when reasoning about familiar and unfamiliar situations. This holds true over different kinds of reasoning problems. Familiar situations are processed in a system involving the frontal and temporal lobes whereas unfamiliar situations are processed in the frontal and parietal lobes. These two similar but dissociated processes provide a biological explanation for the differences between heuristic reasoning and formal logic. =Warm glow heuristic= Corneille, Monin & Pleyers (2004) showed that familiarity of human faces is based on attractiveness. In this study the researchers showed their subjects pictures of faces. The subjects were asked to rate how familiar the face was or was not using visual cues. The visual cues were choosing a picture of a butterfly (attractive) when the subject thought the face was familiar, and choosing a picture of a rat (unattractive) when the subject did not find the face familiar. The result of this study was that the subjects were more familiar when the face was attractive regardless of prior exposure to the picture (or person) itself. This has been referred to as the warm glow effect (Monin 2003). The warm glow effect states that positive stimuli seem more familiar because of the positive emotions they evoke in us. Applications The familiarity heuristic increases the likelihood that customers will repeatedly buy products of the same brand. This concept is known as brand familiarity in consumer behavior. Due to the familiarity heuristic, the customers have the rule of thumb that their past behavior of buying this specific brand's product was most likely correct and should be repeated. A study examining the choice of various models of microwave ovens based on the subjects' familiarity with them showed that high familiarity with the features of microwave ovens allowed for a faster and more confident choice. This effect can also have important implications for medical decision making. Lay people tend to make health decisions that are based on familiarity and availability as opposed to factual knowledge about diseases. This means that they are more likely to take actions and pursue treatment options that have worked in the past, whether they are effective in the current situation or not. This also extends to treatments the patient has not used before but is familiar with. For example, a lay person may request a name-brand medication because they have heard of it before, even though a generic drug may be essentially the same but less expensive. Medical professionals are much more likely to use scientific facts to prescribe treatments. Current criticisms There is some criticism of the concept of familiarity heuristic. It mainly focuses on the point that past behavior does influence present behavior but that this inherits from other, and differing contrivances. One study examining multiple possible mechanisms of how previous behavior influences the present found little support for the familiarity heuristic and tends to conclude instead that the influence of past behavior on a present one decreased when subjects were distracted. However, in order for a heuristic to be valid, its effect should be more prevalent when individuals are distracted and their cognitive capacity is highly strained. This result indicates that it is unlikely that a familiarity heuristic was applied during the experiment. Another limit of familiarity heuristic according to a study by Ouellette & Wood (1998) is that it might not always be applicable. This study showed that the familiarity heuristic might only occur in situations where the target behavior is habitual and occurs in a stable context within the situation. Thus, the familiarity heuristic could be limited to habits and behaviors in routine situations.

In brief, the effort heuristic follows a tendency to judge objects that took a longer time to produce to be of higher value.Kruger, J., Wirtz, D., Boven, L., & Altermatt, T. (2004). The effort heuristic. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 40, 91-98. The more effort invested in an object, the better it is deemed to be. This is especially true in situations where value is difficult to assess or the evaluator lacks expertise in the appraisement of an item. People use whatever information is available to them and effort is thought to generally be a reliable indicator of quality. An example of this would be the comparison of $100 earned, and $100 found. If someone finds $100 they are more inclined to go spend it on a whim, but if that $100 is part of a hard-earned paycheck, they are less likely to squander it away. Another way that effort heuristic can be considered is the amount of effort a person will put into an action depending on the goal.Bijeveld, E., Custers, R., & Aarts, H. (2012). Adaptive reward pursuit: How effort requirements affect unconscious reward responses and conscious reward decisions. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 141, 728-742.Zhang, Y., Xu, J., Jiang, Z., & Huang, S. (2011). Been There, Done That: The Impact of Effort Investment on Goal Value and Consumer Motivation. Journal of Consumer Research, 38, 78-93. If the goal is of little importance, the amount of effort a person is willing to put into it is going to be lower.Festinger, L. (1957). A theory of cognitive dissonance. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press. The Kruger study There is experimental evidence that supports the notion that people sometimes use the effort that has been put into doing something as an estimate for its quality. The seminal study that investigated this phenomenon was done by Kruger, Wirtz, Van Boven, and Altermatt (2004). They conducted three experiments in which participants made judgments of quality‚Äîa poem in Experiment 1, paintings in Experiment 2, and medieval arms and armor in Experiment 3. In each experiment, they manipulated the effort seemingly invested in the objects' creation. Despite the fact that the actual quality of the work remained the same, they anticipated that manipulations in supposed effort would influence perceived quality. = Experiment 1 = In the first experiment, participants evaluated a poem with respect to how much they enjoyed it, the overall quality of the poem, and the amount of money a poetry magazine would pay for the poem. They were told that the experiment concerned the way in which people evaluate poetry. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of two condition groups in this study: low effort and high effort. Participants in the low effort condition were told that the writer spent 4 hours on the poem while participants in the high effort condition were told the poet spent 18 hours on the piece. The researchers combined the liking and quality measures into one composite result and found participants provided more favorable evaluations of the poem when they thought it took the poet 18 hours to compose rather than when they thought it took him 4 hours. They also judged the more effortful poem to be worth more money. = Experiment 2 = In the second experiment, non-experts and self-identified experts individually evaluated the quality of two paintings by Deborah Kleven: 12 Lines and Big Abstract. Half of the participants were told that the former took 4 hours to paint and the latter 26 hours, and the other half were told the opposite. After rating each painting separately, participants then compared the two paintings directly. The results revealed that participants preferred 12 Lines over Big Abstract when they thought 12 Lines took longer to paint, but the opposite tended to be true when they thought that Big Abstract took longer to paint. The effort manipulation had a similar effect on participants estimates of how much the paintings were worth. Participants who thought 12 Lines took longer to produce thought that it was worth more money than Big Abstract, whereas the opposite tended to be true when participants thought that Big Abstract took longer to paint. The data also indicated that the effect of perceived effort on perceived quality was independent of whether participants had self-professed expertise in the domain. Self-identified art experts did not appear to rely on effort any less than novices, despite the fact that the self-identified experts were presumably more practiced at evaluating art. This points to the generality and intuitive appeal of effort as a heuristic for quality. = Experiment 3 = In the third and final experiment, researchers asked participants to rate the quality of several images of medieval arms and armor presented on a computer screen. When rating the final target piece of armor, half of the participants were told that it took the blacksmith 110 hours to complete, and half were told that it took 15 hours. In addition to manipulating the perceived effort invested by the artist, researchers also varied the ambiguity of the stimulus to examine its potential as a moderator in the use of the effort heuristic. This was done by altering the resolution of the image where half of the participants viewed a high-resolution image of the piece, and half viewed a low-resolution image. Experiment 3 produced similar results as the first two; participants provided higher ratings of the piece when they thought it took the blacksmith longer to produce. The more effort invested in the object, the better it was assumed to be. The influence of effort on judgment was also bigger in the high-ambiguity condition than in the low-ambiguity condition. This was expected because the quality of the armor was more ambiguous in the low-resolution condition. Participants in this condition had less objective information upon which to make a judgment of quality, and thus were more likely to rely on the perceived effort invested by the blacksmith while evaluating. Explanations Human behavior, like that of most other animals, is often driven by rewards and directed by the energetic cost of an action. It takes effort to attain rewards, and people accordingly weigh the value of rewards against the amount of effort that is required to attain them. At an early age, children learn that good performance due to high effort is valued by adults and that teachers are most likely to reward those who work hard.Juvonen, J., & Murdock, T. (1995). Grade-Level Differences in the Social Value of Effort: Implications for Self-Presentation Tactics of Early Adolescents. Child Development, 66, 1694-1694.Harari, O., & Covington, M. (1981). Reactions to Achievement Behavior From a Teacher and Student Perspective: A Developmental Analysis. American Educational Research Journal, 18, 15-28. With experience, they internalize effort as a valuable commodity. Alternative theories  Research directly examining and testing the effort heuristic is scarce, however there are other research areas that incorporated this construct and, in some way, manipulated its effects. However, a key distinction between the study done by Kruger et al. and other research on the role of effort on judgment is that the former focused on other-generated effort rather than self-generated effort. =Cognitive dissonance= Effort justification  Over half a century ago, social psychologist Leon Festinger developed the theory of cognitive dissonance. It asserts that inconsistencies among a person's beliefs, attitudes, or opinions produce psychological discomfort, leading people to rationalize their behavior or change their attitudes. One concept that stemmed from the dissonance theory is that of effort justification in which the subjective value of an outcome is directly related to the effort that went into obtaining it. When people suffer, work hard or make sacrifices, they will attempt to convince themselves that it is worthwhile. People tend to put the most value on goals or items which have required considerable effort to achieve. This is probably because cognitive dissonance would arise if great effort is made to achieve something that is subsequently evaluated negatively. Aronson and Mills (1959) Aronson and Mills conducted a studyAronson, E. & Mills, J. (1959). The effect of severity of initiation on liking for a group. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 59, 177-181. where college students underwent a \\"severe\\" or a \\"mild\\" initiation to join a discussion group. Subjects in the severe initiation group were required to read a sexually explicit passage out loud in front of the experimenter, whereas those in the mild initiation group read a less embarrassing passage. When subjects were asked to evaluate the discussion group, those in the severe initiation condition rated it higher than those in the mild initiation group. Aronson and Mills interpreted their result in terms of cognitive dissonance. According to Aronson and Mills, to resolve the dissonance produced by reading the embarrassing passage, subjects in the severe initiation group gave more value to the discussion group than did subjects in the mild initiation group. The more difficult the task, the greater the value given to sources of reinforcement that followed task completion. =Self-perception theory= Daryl Bem (1965) proposed an alternative to the cognitive dissonance theory in explaining how attitudes are shaped. The self-perception theory suggests that people infer their own attitudes, opinions, and other internal states partly by observing their behavior and the circumstances in which that behavior occurs.Bem, D. J. (1972). Self-perception theory. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (Vol. 6, pp. 1‚Äì62). New York: Academic Press. This pattern of thought unfolds because people are engaged in normal efforts to better understand their own behaviors. Bem suggested that all individuals analyze their own behavior as much as an outside observer might and, as a result of these observations, people make judgments about why they are motivated to do what they do. He originally believed that most findings explained by cognitive dissonance were really due to self-perception. However, studies have shown that self-perception is primarily at work when subjects do not have well-defined attitudes regarding the issue at hand.Olson, J., Roesesc, N., Meen, J., & Robertson, D. (1995). The Preconditions and Consequences of Relative Deprivation: Two Field Studies1. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 25, 944‚Äì964. Applications =Goal evaluations= Research has shown that the amount of energy put towards the achievement of a goal may play a role in the development or change of an individual's attitude towards that goal.Maich, K. (2014). Reducing cognitive dissonance through effort justification: Evidence from past studies and daily experience. Western Undergraduate Psychology Journal, 1, 1‚Äì3. While evaluating a goal, one is motivated to place more value on a goal that has required greater effort to achieve.Zentall, T. R. (2010). Justification of effort by humans and pigeons: Cognitive dissonance or contrast? Current Directions in Psychological Science, 19, 296-300. Axsom and Cooper (1985) suggested that if an objective or the way in which a goal is obtained is not initially attractive, an individual may later look to their own past behavior to determine their attitude towards that goal. If much effort has been spent in the attainment of a goal, it should come to be seen as worthwhile and therefore more attractive.Axsom, D., & Cooper, J. (1985). Cognitive dissonance and psychotherapy: The role of effort justification in inducing weight loss. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 21, 149-160. This resembles the need to justify one's efforts in accordance with the cognitive dissonance theory but there is evidence supporting that other factors may be at play. One study proposed that the experienced goal value and consumers' subsequent motivation vary as a function of whether or not the pursuit of the goal is perceived to be one's autonomous choice. They found that when consumers perceive that the goal they pursue is adopted through an autonomous choice, the initial effort investment is experienced as reflecting the value of the goal; therefore, greater effort increased the value of the goal as well as consumers' subsequent motivation. Conversely, if consumers perceive that the goal has been imposed on them, they experience psychological reactance that is proportional to the amount of effort that they expend in pursuing the goal; thus, they devalue the goal as they invest more effort in its pursuit and show lower subsequent motivation. =Consumer appraisement= The study by Kruger et al. demonstrated that when evaluating an item, people have a tendency to judge objects that took a longer time to produce to be of higher value. With this knowledge, companies can manipulate the manner in which a product is viewed to make their products appear desirable to consumers. Because effort is usually required to get the best outcomes, people looking for the best outcomes presume effort must imply the best possible outcome. Bri√±ol, Petty, and Tormala (2006) suggested that the impact of effort on evaluation depends on the meaning people are overtly directed to assign to effort.Bri√±ol, Pablo, Richard E. Petty, and Zakary L. Tormala (2006), ‚ÄúThe Malleable Meaning of Subjective Ease,‚Äù Psychological Science, 17 (3), 200‚Äì206. For example, if people are told that unintelligent people like ease, outcomes associated with ease are judged less favorably.Kim, S., & Labroo, A. (2011). From Inherent Value to Incentive Value: When and Why Pointless Effort Enhances Consumer Preference. Journal of Consumer Research, 38, 712-742. =Marxian economics= Labor theory of value The principles of the effort heuristic display a striking resemblance to the labor theory of value. This theory is a major pillar of traditional Marxian economics. Its basic claim is simple: the value of a commodity can be objectively measured by the average number of labor hours required to produce that commodity.Bowles, S., & Gintis, H. (1977). The marxian theory of value and heterogenous labour: A critique and reformulation. Cambridge Journal of Economics, 1, 173-192. Marx described labor power as a worker's capacity to produce goods and services. He explained that the long-run wage workers receive will depend on the number of labor hours it takes to produce a person who is fit for work.

Trudeau defined a just society before becoming the Prime Minister of Canada: The phrase is now an ingrained part of Canadian political discourse. Those on the social-democratic left consider themselves Trudeau's heirs and vigorously denounce any policy that would harm the Just Society legacy, while the neoliberal right attacks the notion that Trudeau's Canada was more \\"just\\" than other eras.  Irish usage Additionally, the concept of a just society is the ideal strived for by advocates of social justice, civil rights, and toleration, of which Trudeau was one. Notable other users of the phrase have included Irish Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave of the Fine Gael party.

Coaching career Barone coached as the offensive line coach for the Denver Broncos in 2010, as well as from 2015‚Äì2016. As the Offensive Line Coach for the Denver Broncos, his offensive line paved the way to victory in Super Bowl 50 over the Carolina Panthers. He also served as the Broncos' tight ends coach in 2009, as well as the 2011‚Äì2014 seasons, which includes their Offensive record breaking season of 2013 and an appearance in Super Bowl XLVIII. He has also served as offensive line and tight ends coach for the Atlanta Falcons, as well as tight ends coach for the San Diego Chargers. Barone worked with All- Pro players Alge Crumpler (Falcons) and Antonio Gates (Chargers), and Julius Thomas (Broncos) all of whom made multiple Pro Bowl appearances under his guidance. Kyle Rudolph (Vikings) also was selected to the Pro Bowl after the 2017 season. This feat marked the first time in NFL history that a Tight Ends coach had four players selected to Pro Bowls with four teams. In addition, Barone also coached multiple Pro Bowl caliber players as the Offensive Line coach for the Denver Broncos, including; Ryan Clady, Zane Beadles, Louis Vasquez, Matt Paradis and Evan Mathis. Barone coached teams that led the NFL in rushing four times. Along with that the 2015 Broncos rushing attack was hampered by multiple injuries in the early part of the season but rebounded to lead the NFL in rushing from week 6 thru the end of the season. The 2016 season saw the Broncos again dominate the NFL in rushing for the first part of the season before injuries forced three running backs onto the injured reserved list. Prior to coaching the Falcons, Barone had coached offensive lines at seven colleges for 17 years. On February 7, 2016, Barone was the Offensive Line coach for the Broncos that won Super Bowl 50. In the game, the Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers by a score of 24‚Äì10. After Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak stepped down in January 2017, Barone was not retained by new head coach, Vance Joseph. Barone was hired that same month to serve as the tight ends coach for the Minnesota Vikings. In 2018, following the sudden death of offensive line coach Tony Sparano, Barone was moved to Offensive Line coach. After spending the 2019 season out of coaching, Barone was hired by the Chicago Bears as their tight ends coach on January 9, 2020.

The location was used as a low-water crossing of Onion Creek as early as the 1840s but did not receive its current name until the early 1900s, when John B. Moore built a store in the area. Moore's Crossing was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 16, 1996 Description and significance The southeastern quadrant of what is now Travis County was the first part of the county Europeans settled after the Spanish (and later Mexican) government opened Texas lands to colonists in the 1820s. Watered by the Colorado River, the region's rich black land promised much greater agricultural potential than the rocky hills to the west. Its first residents were farmers who plowed fields and built modest homes along the rivers and creeks that ran through the area. Despite the designation and subsequent growth of nearby Austin as the state capital and county seat, southeast Travis County remained largely an agricultural region until the construction of Bergstrom Air Force Base in 1942, during World War II. Population growth in 1990s and the opening of ABIA in 1999 was followed by commercial development along Texas State Highway 71. In 1915, three of six spans from the 1884 iron Congress Avenue Bridge, which had been put into storage in 1910, were used to construct a bridge at Moore's Crossing (formerly Onion Creek Bridge). The bridge was washed away by a spring flood that year. The current bridge, built by the Austin Bridge Company of Dallas is made of concrete piers and the remaining three spans from the Congress Avenue Bridge. It was completed in 1922 and took Burleson Road across Onion Creek to Farm to Market Road 973. On January 8, 1980, the bridge was \\"finally put to rest\\" after nearly 97 years. Richard Moya, Travis County Commissioner Precinct 4, stated the bridge would be closed to automobile traffic due to risk of structural failure. The estimate to stabilize the one-lane bridge for traffic was $750,000 and that did not include widening it to support the increased traffic caused by area growth. A four-lane concrete beam bridge with a different alignment to Farm to Market Road 973 was built instead. The county barricaded the bridge at Moore's Crossing and turned it into a pedestrian bridge. The bridge at Moore's Crossing was registered as a Historic Landmark in 1980 by the Texas Historical Commission. The community itself was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 16, 1996. The bridge decorated for production of \\"The Leftovers\\" In television Warner Bros. Television used the Moore's Crossing Bridge and the park beneath it as a location for season 2 of The Leftovers, which airs on HBO. Production at the location occurred between April and October 2015.

B. canis is rod-shaped or a coccus, and is oxidase, catalase, and urease positive. The species was firstly described in United States in 1966 where mass abortions of beagles were documented. The disease is characterized by epididymitis and orchitis in male dogs, endometritis, placentitis, and abortions in females, and often presents as infertility in both sexes. Other symptoms such as inflammation in the eyes and axial and appendicular skeleton; lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, are less common. Humans can be also infected, but occurrences are rare. Although there has been an increase in the international movement of dogs, Brucella canis is still very uncommon. B. canis is a zoonotic organism. Signs of this disease are different in both genders of dogs; females that have B. canis infections face an abortion of their developed fetuses. Males face the chance of infertility, because they develop an antibody against the sperm. This may be followed by inflammation of the testes which generally settles down a while after. Symptoms do not only include testicular inflammation, infertility in males, and abortion in females. Another symptom is the infection of the spinal plates or vertebrae, which is called diskospondylitis. Treatment for B. canis is very difficult to find and often very expensive. The combination of minocycline and streptomycin is thought to be useful, but it is often unaffordable. Tetracycline can be a less expensive substitute for minocycline, but it also lowers the effect of the treatment. Brucella canis is a gram negative coccobacillus bacteria.‚ÄúBrucellosis: Brucella Canis Contagious Abortion, Undulant Fever.‚Äù http://Www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/Pdfs/brucellosis_canis.Pdf, The Center for Food Security & Public Health, 28 May 2018, www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf. B. canis can be found in both pets and wild animals and lasts the lifespan of the animal it has affected. It is generally spotted in the animal's reproductive organs. This infection usually causes the animal to spontaneously abort a fetus and can also cause an animal to become sterile.Brucellosis Fact Sheet. State of California California Department of Public Health Health and Human Services Agency Division of Communicable Disease Control, July 2012, www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/BrucellosisFactSheet.pdf. B. canis is relatively easy to prevent in dogs. There is a simple blood test that can be done by a veterinarian. Any dog that will be used for breeding or has the capability to breed should be tested. Although rare, humans can contract the infection. It is unlikely, but most common in dog breeders, those in laboratories dealing with the bacteria, or people who are immunocompromised.Brucellosis FAQs for Dog Owners. Georgia Division of Public Health in Partnership with the Georgia Department of Agriculture Office of the State Veterinarian, and the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine, 13 June 2006, agr.georgia.gov/Data/Sites/1/media/ag_animalindustry/animal_health/files/caninebrucellosiskennelanowner.pdf. B. canis is difficult to treat. Long term antibiotics can be given but usually results in a relapse. Spaying and neutering can be effective, and frequent blood tests are recommended to monitor progress. Dogs in kennels that are affected by B. canis are usually euthanized for the protection of other dogs and the humans caring for them.Canine Brucellosis and Foster-Based Dog Rescue Programs.

It was formerly the State Government Insurance Commission which was operated by the Government of South Australia, providing compulsory third party motor vehicle insurance. SGIC first opened its doors for business on 4 January 1972 with a staff of 24 housed in the third level of Adelaide House at 55 Waymouth Street, Adelaide. When the Bill to establish SGIC was introduced into the South Australian Parliament, Premier Don Dunstan declared that SGIC's role was to help keep premiums at reasonable levels, ensure by competition that adequate service was given and make funds available for investment in semi governmental loans important to the development of the State. The first premium income for SGIC came from insuring the motor vehicle fleet of the South Australian Government $155,026. SGIC moved to new premises on 24 April 1981 at 211 Victoria Square, Adelaide. SGIC grew from a concept in 1971 to become the largest general insurer in South Australia by 1992 selling motor, home, life, commercial and health insurance throughout the state via 19 branches. By 1992 one in four South Australians was a client of SGIC and it employed close to 1,000. In the latter half of the 1998, the SGIC was acquired by SGIO of Western Australia. In 2000 SGIO was acquired by the 'NRMA who in turn acquired CGU. SGIC and CGU moved to new building at 80 Flinders Street in 2005.

Impracticability is similar in some respects to the doctrine of impossibility because it is triggered by the occurrence of a condition which prevents one party from fulfilling the contract. The major difference between the two doctrines is that while impossibility excuses performance where the contractual duty cannot physically be performed, the doctrine of impracticability comes into play where performance is still physically possible, but would be extremely burdensome for the party whose performance is due. Thus, impossibility is an objective condition, whereas impracticability is a subjective condition for a court to determine. Typically, the test U.S. courts use for impracticability is as follows (with a few variations among different jurisdictions): See e.g. Transatlantic Financing Corp. v. United States, 363 F.2d 312 (D.C. Cir., 1966) # There must be an occurrence of a condition, the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption of the contract, # The occurrence must make performance extremely expensive or difficult # This difficulty was not anticipated by the parties to the contract (note: some jurisdictions require that there be no measure within the contract itself to allocate risk between the parties) Restatement of Contracts Section 261 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts does not explicitly define the scope of what is considered impracticable, as it is a fairly subjective and fact-intensive test for the courts. Generally, courts do not consider events such as an increase in price or costs beyond a normal range to allow for discharge of duties on grounds of impracticability, as such events are normally foreseeable risks of fixed-price contracts. Uniform Commercial Code Section 2-615 of the Uniform Commercial Code deals with impracticability in the context of sales of goods, and introduces some additional constraints on the parties. A party whose ability to perform his obligations has only been partially affected must allocate production and delivery among his customers in a manner which is fair and reasonable, affording each of them with partial performance, and must notify all purchasers that there will be delay, partial delivery, or non-delivery. This is similar in some respects to the doctrine of general average in admiralty law. According to note 4 under UCC 2-615, increased cost alone does not excuse performance unless the rise in cost is due to some unforeseen contingency which alters the nature of performance. It further explains that a change in market conditions resulting in a rise or drop in prices is not sufficient to claim impracticability because the parties assumed that risk when the contract was made. The comments indicate that contingencies such as war, embargo, crop failures, or a failure of a major source of supply that causes the market change or prevents a seller from obtaining supplies necessary for his performance would justify a claim of impracticability.

The Overpeck Creek flows to the west of the Henry Hoebel Area and the South Area of the park. History The first inhabitants of the area were Ashkineshacky Native Americans, who lived around Leonia. Approximately a thousand Native Americans had their seasonal activities, collecting shells for wampum and hosting their bath festivals in Overpeck Creek. In 1954, the president of the Bergen County Park Commission, A. Thornton Bishop, proposed a plan to build a county park. This park was originally planned to rival Central Park in New York City. In the 1950s, Leonia, Palisades Park, Ridgefield Park, and Teaneck donated municipal land for the development of the Overpeck County Park. During the 1970s, Teaneck's municipal government, under then-Mayor Eleanor Kieliszek, sold a 350-acre parcel of land to Bergen County, which was later incorporated into Overpeck County Park. Henry Hoebel Area was the first area to undergo development; the other areas remained undeveloped and were used as dumping sites for garbage and car tires until they posed environmental hazards to their surroundings. The park vicinity was notable being filled with solid waste. Ridgefield Park and Teaneck filed a lawsuit against Bergen County because the park land was not developed and used properly. The project began in 2003 and the expanded park opened in 2010. In 2002, the Teaneck Creek Conservancy and the Bergen County Parks Department began to establish a environmental and cultural park as part of Overpeck Park.

Birney, and printed Achilles Pugh for the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society. Originally published at New Richmond, Ohio due to complications with Cincinnati mayor Samuel W. Davies, the paper moved to Cincinnati in April 1836 to resume publication. The plan had always involved Cincinnati, but Birney wanted to publish a few issues out of the jurisdiction of Davies first. The paper often gave readers two sides of an argument. He would print news items from the South that were proslavery and then critique them. The paper was the target of at least two episodes of mob violence in the city. One incident occurred on July 30, 1836, when rioters broke into the printing offices of the paper and vandalized the interior, scattering the types throughout the streets. The mob continued to the Pugh's house and the residence of Birney, leaving both places undisturbed. They returned to the offices and debated on whether to burn the material, deciding not to do so because they were feared that the homes in the area might also catch fire. The mob then proceeded to the offices of Charles Hammond, editor of the Cincinnati Daily Gazette. Hammond was an ally of Birney insofar as free speech was concerned, though himself was not an abolitionist. Deciding against action on the Gazette offices, the mob dispersed to the black areas of town and began vandalizing the area when gunfire erupted. After brief dispersal, the mob returned to the area and found abandoned homes, which they proceeded to enter and deface. At this point mayor Samuel W. Davies, who had watched the destruction of the office earlier, instructed the crowd to disperse. A second incident occurred in September 1841, described in the Cincinnati Gazette, during which the printing press and office of the Philanthropist were destroyed.

He was a member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1926 to 1943, representing the seat of Eden-Monaro for the Nationalist Party of Australia and its successor the United Australia Party. He was a minister in the governments of Joseph Lyons and Robert Menzies. Early life and state politics Perkins was born at Gocup near Tumut, New South Wales, and educated at Tumut Public School and Cooma Public School. He was a small farmer at Cooma from 1894 to 1899, when he leased the property and became a newsagent, bookseller and stationer in Cooma. He was a Municipality of Cooma councillor from 1902 to 1909 and was Mayor of Cooma in 1904 and 1908. He was also president of the Cooma School of Arts, president of the Parents' and Citizens' Association, a justice of the peace, the local coroner, a director of the Monaro Grammar School, a member of the local land board and Grand Master of the Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity. Perkins was an unsuccessful candidate for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Monaro in 1904 and in 1907. He married Evelyn Mary Bray in 1909. He was appointed to a casual vacancy for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Goulburn in November 1921 following the death of Nationalist MP William Millard. As the countback method used to fill vacancies under the 1920-1927 proportional representation experiment (in which each seat had multiple members) was unable to fill the seat, the legislation was changed to allow for him to fill Millard's seat by appointment. He resigned from the Legislative Assembly in January 1926 upon his winning Nationalist Party preselection to contest a federal by-election for the seat of Eden-Monaro. Federal parliamentary career In January 1926 Perkins won the Federal seat of Eden-Monaro at a by-election. He lost the seat in 1929 to Labor's John Cusack amid that year's massive Labor landslide. However, Perkins retook the seat in 1931 amid an equally massive landslide for the UAP (Cusack did not stand in that election). He was government whip from 1926 to 1929 and was appointed Minister for the Interior in the Lyons government in October 1932, responsible among other things for administering the Northern Territory. The anthropologist, A. P. Elkin congratulated him on his efforts \\"to make inter-racial conditions in the North more equable and more just\\". Nevertheless, criticism of Australia's treatment of indigenous Australians in the British press led Lyons to drop him from Cabinet in 1934. He was minister without portfolio from November 1937 to November 1938, Minister in charge of Territories for two days in November 1938 and then Minister for Trade and Customs until April 1939, when he became Minister without portfolio administering External Territories until March 1940. He was defeated by Allan Fraser in the 1943 elections. Later life Perkins spent the last ten years of his life researching the history of the Monaro region, with some of his records being donated to the State Library of New South Wales upon his death. He died in the Sydney suburb of Manly in 1954, and was accorded a state funeral; he was cremated.

Janaki grew up in a well-to-do Tamil family in Malaya and was only 16 when she heard Subhas Chandra Bose's appeal to Indians to give whatever they could for their fight for Indian independence. Immediately she took off her gold earrings and donated them. She was determined to join the women's wing, the Rani of Jhansi Regiment of the Indian National Army. There was strong family objection especially from her father. But after much persuasion, her father finally agreed. She was among the first women to join the Indian National Army organised during the Japanese occupation of Malaya to fight for Indian independence with the Japanese. Having been brought up in luxury, she initially could not adapt to the rigours of army life. However, she gradually got used to military life and her career in the regiment took off. She became second in command of the regiment.Women Against the Raj: The Rani of Jhansi Regiment By Joyce C. Lebra, p.xii After World War II she emerged as a welfare activist. Janaki found the Indian National Congress's fight for Indian independence inspiring and joined the Indian Congress Medical Mission in then Malaya.

Inland Inuit The Ihalmiut ·êÉ·ê¶·êä·ì™·í•·êÖ·ë¶ , Caribou Inuit people, are Inland Inuit who were also \\"known as the (\\"People from Beyond\\") or Ahiarmiut (\\"the Out-of-the-Way Dwellers\\"). Until 1957, their home was in the region of Ennadai Lake. Ihalmiut were Caribou Inuit, inland- dwelling people in the Barren Lands region whose subsistence centered on hunting barren-ground caribou. The Ahialmiut \\"subsisted almost entirely on caribou year-round, unlike other Inuit groups that depended at least partially on harvest of animals from the sea.\\" =History= During Joseph Tyrrell's Barren Lands expeditions of 1893 and 1894 on behalf of the Geological Survey of Canada, he reported that there were approximately 2,000 Caribou Eskimo. By 1934, Ihalmiut numbered 80, with 11 considered as heads of families. Their contact with Europeans was limited, but included Hudson's Bay Company's post managers, at the company's Windy Post, located in 1936 on a portion of Windy River called Simmons Lake, and later moved to Nueltin Lake. Ihalmiut traded their outer parkas, deerskin boots, and fur pelts at the post for guns, ammunition, and tea. Chipewyan and Metis traded here, too. In their 1994 publication, Tammarniit (Mistakes), Inuit Relocation in the Eastern Arctic, 1939-63, F.J. Tester and Peter Kulchyski accessed archival documents, including the Alex Stevenson Collection, which had been in storage in the Archives of the Northwest Territories archives, many of which had not been previously available to researchers. They wrote that the Inuit whose camp was located on the Kazan River near Ennadai Lake and hunted caribou between Kazan River and Nueltin Lake, were known as Ennadai Lake Inuit. They hunted caribou between Kazan River and Nueltin Lake. In the summer of 1956 there were 30 men and women and 25 children. Twelve of the children were under five years old. Relocation In the late mid-20th century, the Ihalmiut began a series of federal government sponsored relocations in order to clear the land for government operations and to centralize Inuit populations under government control and surveillance. * 1949, Ihalmiut were relocated against their will from Ennadai Lake to Nueltin Lake, but the relocation did not last as hunting was poor, precipitating the band's return to Ennadai Lake. * May 1957, Ihalmiut were airlifted from Ennadai Lake to Henik Lake, 45 miles from the Padlei trading post, a distance considered reasonable by the Government of Canada. Many Ihalmiut starved.Damas, David. Arctic Migrants/Arctic Villagers The Transformation of Inuit Settlement in the Central Arctic. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2002. * Later in 1957, Ihalmiut were moved to Whale Cove where some began carving figurines for income. * In 1958, 29 Ihalmiut went to Padlei because of its trading post, 39 were at Yathkyed Lake, and the majority were brought to Eskimo Point by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. * In 1959, the Padlei trading post closed, and the remaining Ihalmiut were relocated.  Apology by the Government of Canada  In 2018 The Ahiarmiut and the Canadian government came to a settlement agreement of $5 million for forced relocations of the Ahiarmut between 1949 and 1959.On January 22nd, 2019, the Canadian Government formally apologized to 21 survivors and their families in Arviat, Nunavut. Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett delivered the apology in the community, saying the forced relocations were because of a \\"colonial mindset\\" and caused \\"indignity, starvation and death.\\" \\"This apology is a tribute to their spirits and their memories. It is also an opportunity for all Canadians to learn about and reflect upon a dark chapter in our history. I humbly and sincerely offer these words to all Ahiarmiut past and present. We are sorry.\\" Bennett also apologized for the amount of time it took to get an apology ‚Äî when the legal claim was first filed, 27 relocated Ahiarmiut were still alive, at the time of the apology there were only 21. Media coverage A photo of Stephen Angulalik and his wives appeared in Life magazine, in October 1937.

He is perhaps best remembered for starring in the British sitcoms Mixed Blessings (1978‚Äì80) and That's My Boy (1981‚Äì86).  Early life He was born Peter Ronald Gray on 23 August 1949 in Chingford, London, England. His father, Charles (known as Harry), was a plasterer and his mother, Elizabeth, a dressmaker and housewife. They went on to have two more sons. The family emigrated to Australia in the late 1950s but returned in 1966 and he attended the Fitzherbert Secondary Modern School, Brighton, Sussex. He then trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama and changed his name to Christopher Blake, because there was another Peter Gray registered with the actors' union, Equity. He chose the surname Blake from the telephone directory.  Career Blake first came to the attention of television audiences in 1972 when he was cast as Gilbert Blythe in the 1972 BBC adaptation of Anne of Green Gables. He would later reprise the role in 1975 in Anne of Avonlea. Blake later had roles in the LWT serial Love for Lydia (1977), and then a starring role in the ITV sitcom Mixed Blessings (1978‚Äì80) for which he also sang the theme tune. Although Blake remained busy as an actor in various stage and television roles, his next truly successful venture was the ITV sitcom That's My Boy (1981‚Äì86) in which he played Robert Price, a middle-class doctor who hires a live-in housekeeper (played by Mollie Sugden) who turns out to be his biological mother. After That's My Boy, Blake continued in character parts in episodic television, but never managed to land the more prominent roles that he had enjoyed earlier in his career. In 2000, he guest-starred in the Doctor Who audio adventure The Mutant Phase which featured the Daleks. In later years Christopher Blake turned to screenwriting, writing several episodes of Channel 5's short-lived soap Family Affairs. He wrote two episodes (\\"Dancing in the Dark\\" and \\"Endangered Species\\") of the ITV crime serial A Touch of Frost with his writing partner Tony Charles.  Personal life He was married twice and had three children from his first marriage; two daughters and a son. A talented all-round cricketer since his youth in Australia, he played the game throughout his life, including for The Lord's Taverners and William Franklyn's team, the Sargentmen, which raised money for the Malcolm Sargent Cancer Fund for Children. One of his other great passions was supporting Arsenal F.C. and he dropped references to Arsenal into scripts whenever the opportunity arose.  Illness and death In early 2004 after an aggressive and rare form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma was diagnosed, Blake received treatment at the Royal Marsden Hospital in Surrey. He died on 11 December 2004 in London, England, aged 55. He is buried at the East London Cemetery and Crematorium.Christopher Blake (1949‚Äì2004) - Find A Grave Memorial Television creditsChristopher Blake (I) * Casualty .... Alan / ...

All tracks were written by Craig Wuest except \\"Golden Rendezvous,\\" which was written by Wuest and Daniel Zongrone, and \\"Forest Floor, Part II: Aras,\\" a tape-loop improvisation with guitarist Dennis Rea. The title, Atomkraft? Nein, Danke! has been the slogan of the German anti-nuclear movement since the 70s and literally means \\"Nuclear power?

Among Augier's most famous works is his sirventes (a planh or lament) now entitled A People Grieving for the Death of their Lord, which commemorates either the murder of Raymond I Trencavel in 1167 or, as is more preferred, of Raymond Roger Trencavel in 1209.Graham-Leigh, 31.Siberry, 160, who believes that Augier blames the Crusaders for the murder. It has been described as a \\"funeral oration\\", but its contemporaneousness with the death of Raymond Roger has been called into question recently. It was probably written at a much later date. The chief purpose of the sirventes may be to mourn the lost culture of Languedoc before the Albigensian Crusade and the \\"lord\\" of the story is probably a stereotype meant to represent that culture.Graham-Leigh, 32.

He also worked as a farmer, hunter, trapper, self-taught surveyor, and politician. Bartholomew County, Indiana and the Bartholomew Trail were named after him. Family life Bartholomew was born in New Jersey. At the age of 2, around the time of his father's death, his family moved to Laurel Hill, Pennsylvania. Bartholomew married Christiana Pickenpaugh in 1788 and they moved to Northern Kentucky, near present-day Louisville, with his mother. In 1800 he moved his family into the newly created Indiana Territory in an area known as Clark's Grant near the town of Charlestown in Southern Indiana. In 1809, his wife died giving birth to their tenth child. In June 1811, Bartholomew married Elizabeth McNaught. She died in 1824 from injuries sustained after being thrown from a horse. Joseph never remarried. His descendants are now living throughout the United States. His daughter Martha and several of his grandchildren were some of the earliest converts to Mormonism, and several were baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.ABC/SBC Family Foundation General Joseph Bartholomew Military involvement Though he was only 10 years old at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, he joined the local militia and helped defend against Native American tribes who were raiding the western frontier. After moving to Kentucky in 1788, Bartholomew remained active in the local militia, and engaged in numerous skirmishes with Native Americans. During the Northwest Indian War (Little Turtle's War), Bartholomew served as a scout for General \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne and was present at the signing of the Treaty of Greenville. After moving to Indiana, he received a commission as major in the Clark County militia on September 21, 1803. Three years later, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. On November 7, 1811, he took part in the Battle of Tippecanoe. Recently promoted to colonel, he led 120 militia members under Governor William Henry Harrison. During the battle, Bartholomew was shot and seriously wounded in his right arm. For his leadership during the Battle of Tippecanoe, Bartholomew was promoted to brigadier general. The Indiana territorial legislature passed a resolution on December 4, 1811, which read, \\"Resolved‚Ä¶ that the thanks of this house be presented to Col. Luke Decker and Col. Joseph Bartholomew, the officers, non-commissioned officers and men composing the militia corps under their command‚Ä¶for the distinguished valor, heroism and bravery displayed by them in the brilliant battle fought with the Shawnee Prophet and his confederates on the morning of the 7th of Nov, 1811 by the Army under the command of His Excellency William Henry Harrison.\\" When Bartholomew's son fell ill, he volunteered to enlist as a private in his place under the command of Colonel Russell of the 7th Regiment to fight in the White River Campaign during the War of 1812. Colonel Russell praised Bartholomew, telling the Indiana territorial governor, \\"Col. Bartholomew acted as my aide- de-camp; the veteran has been so well tried in this kind of warfare, that any encomiums from me would be useless.\\" In 1816, he was commissioned as major general, the highest rank at that time. He served as major general of the Indiana militia until 1822. Later life After his wartime military service came to an end, Bartholomew became involved in politics. In 1818, he served on the Indiana General Assembly, and was elected to the Indiana Senate in 1820. He was selected to be a member of the commission that would choose the location of the capital of Indiana, and helped pick Indianapolis as the new site. He would often claim \\"to have dug the first dirt for the State capital.\\" Though he moved home in 1822, he continued to serve the state on the board of commissioners for land deeds. He retired in 1825. In 1831 Bartholomew was the bondsman for his neighbor Dr. Andrew P. Hay, who had embezzled government funds. As a result of the embezzlement, Bartholomew sold his farm and moved to McLean County, Illinois. He and his son planted a new town named Clarksville, north of present-day Bloomington, which was abandoned by the 1850s. He was an avid supporter in William Henry Harrison's presidential campaign in 1840. In the fall of that year, his health began declining. He died on November 3, 1840, and was buried in Clarksville cemetery in McLean County. His grave marker was placed by the Grand Army of the Republic in 1894 with the inscription \\"To the memory of Maj. Genl. Joseph Bartholomew Hero of Tippecanoe. He also fought in the Revolutionary War, The War of 1812, & the Black Hawk War.\\" In 1973, a stone monument marking the approximate location of Gen.

Motorsport  When Ford Australia pulled out of racing in 1973 designer Wayne Draper saw an opportunity to provide Falcon racing teams with aerodynamic kits. He set up an aftermarket body styling company with Bob McWilliam, but remained a silent partner to avoid conflicts with Ford management. Between 1976 and 1978 they produced front splitters and rear spoilers for XB and XC Falcon Hardtop race cars. Draper, who was a Senior Designer for the XD-XF Falcon, purchased the rights to the \\"HO\\" nameplate, as \\"homologated options\\". Draper then designed an aero kit and tested scale models of an XD Falcon in Ford's wind tunnel. This became known as \\"XD Phase 5\\". The Confederation of Australian Motor Sport implemented a few changes (including using Dick Johnson's rear spoiler rather than the Phase 5 wing) to the cars for homologation and HO/Phase Auto then produced the 25 cars required to allow the XD to race as a Group C Touring Car. Dick Johnson and John French won the 1981 James Hardie 1000 driving a Ford Falcon (XD) Dick Johnson drove a Group C Falcon XD, commonly called \\"Tru-Blu\\" (due to the cars blue paint and the name of the steel products from the main sponsor - Palmer Tube Mills), to win the 1981 and 1982 Australian Touring Car Championships.www.shannons.com.auSam Hollier, Street Fords Issue's 86 and 111 Johnson and co-driver John French also won the 1981 James Hardie 1000 driving an XDAustralian Motor Racing Yearbook, 1981/82 when race was stopped after a multi-car accident on lap 121 of 163. For the first time in the history of the Bathurst 1000, the race officials declared the race over as more than 2/3 had been completed. French was driving the car at the time of the accident and was well clear in first place, gradually increasing his lead on the second placed XD Falcon of Bob Morris (co-driver John Fitzpatrick). The Falcon was rated at and is now part of the David Bowden collection. Allan Moffat also raced an XD Falcon in the 1980 Bathurst 1000 when delays in approval of his Mazda RX-7 meant he would have to wait until the following season in 1981. Ford Australia had announced that they would not be taking part in racing due to a disagreement with CAMS over homologating the XD, which left AMR with no program and budget. By the end of the ATCC, Moffat still had no vehicle and it eventuated that he might miss the upcoming Bathurst 1000. Six weeks out from the race, Moffat put together a deal to run a yellow XD Falcon. Lack of time limited its development and Moffat had to essentially use the practice sessions at Bathurst to test the car. Recurring oil problems with the dry-sump system could not be eliminated during practice and on race day the vehicle was a DNF after only 2 laps due to the failure of the oil system. This was the last time Ford racing legend Allan Moffat would race a Falcon for many years and the yellow XD is also part of the David Bowden collection along with many of his other racing Falcons.

Soglow solved the conflict by selling Hearst a temporary, nearly-identical strip: The Ambassador.

The basic data elements of an original epedigree are: * Lot * Potency * Expiration * National Drug Code and Electronic Product Code * Manufacturer * Distributor, Wholesaler or Pharmacy * Unique identifier of the salable unit As the product moves down the supply chain, each company is required to carry forward all previous epedigree information. In this way, the final point of sale has the complete lineage of every unit. Laws ePedigree laws were eventually replaced by a harmonized national standard called the Drug Quality and Security Act. ePedigree laws were in a rapid state of flux with states changing the \\"drop dead\\" date for compliance with tracking and authentication years beyond the original dates set by Florida and California. The definitive requirements will include serialization. Companies that focus purely on achieving compliance will miss the opportunity to use regulation as a business driver. The ability to track and serialize unit level saleable packages (e.g. bottle of 25 pills) not just cases or pallets can create business value in knowing exactly where their products are purchased can do the following: 1) Minimize cost of chargebacks through 100% accurate adjudication. Chargebacks account for 2-15% of gross revenue for a pharmaceutical manufacturer. 2) Minimize risk by increasing accuracy in Medicare/Medicaid pricing calculations by fully knowing all fees, rebates, and chargebacks that should be applied to a specific unit sale. Over $4B in fines have been handed down for improperly calculating Medicare/Medicaid pricing. 3) Limit liability of having to recall entire lots of product because a (non-serialized) shipment was stolen - see example: 4) Achieve visibility for manufacturers in the labyrinth that is the wholesale distribution network to more accurately forecast demand and measure sales & marketing programs. Although simple epedigree systems are an important first step, significant improvement in public safety would result from a more standardized and automated approach. The larger and more difficult task of providing for an Automated Epedigree System has been suggested, but not required by any state. Such a system would require fairly significant changes to supply chain companies' data interchanges and would certainly require advanced Track and Trace technology (with bar codes or RFID). The requirements that come closest to an Automated Epedigree System have been proposed by California. In March 2008, the California Board of Pharmacy (CBOP) published its \\"E-Pedigree Requirements\\" which are scheduled to go into effect in a phased approach between 2015-2017 (since abandoned). CBOP has proposed an XML standard document and the law requires an \\"interoperable electronic system\\".

He taught her to ride a horse, carry a lance and pike, and wield an axe and sword. In her adulthood he was the commander of her armies. In 1061 Rome was enveloped in a civil war, with partisans of the Antipope Honorius II holding Trastevere and the Castel Sant'Angelo while the supporters of the legitimate Pope Nicholas II were sustained in the city by the wealth and mercenaries of Leo de Benedicto, who eventually dislodged the antipapists from the castle. An army commanded by Godfrey, former Duke of Lower Lorraine, and Arduino, along with the young Matilda, arrived on the scene and skirmished with the forces of Honorius led by Guibert of Ravenna. Arduino is said to have led a force of 400 archers, 400 pikemen, and a regiment of cavalry with which he charged Guibert, who was trying to join battle with Godfrey, and forced him to retreat. In 1111 the Emperor Henry V entered Rome to be crowned and left the city with Pope Paschal II, Bernard, Bishop of Parma, and Bonsignore, Bishop of Reggio as prisoners and took to the Sabine country. Matilda promptly sent Arduino to secure their release, which he did through negotiations.

From Golf Course Drive, Five Creek flows northwest, paralleling Country Club Drive to Fairway Drive. It crosses the golf course, emerging near the end of Fauna Avenue. North of the city limits, it turns abruptly westward and flows under U.S. Route 101 at the Santa Rosa Avenue interchange. West of U.S. Route 101, the channel turns to the southwest, crossing under Millbrae Avenue, Whistler Avenue, Wilfred Avenue, and Rohnert Park Expressway before entering the Laguna de Santa Rosa just east of Stony Point Road.

It was also known as the South London Hospital for Women and the South London Women's Hospital. Founded by Eleanor Davies-Colley and Maud Chadburn in 1912, it always employed an all-woman staff. It closed in 1984. Foundation Eleanor Davies-Colley and Maud Chadburn, two surgeons at the New Hospital for Women (later the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital, now the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Obstetric Hospital), began raising funds in 1911 for a new South London general hospital for women and children, with the aim of employing an all- woman medical staff. The New Hospital (the first hospital to be run along these lines) was increasingly unable to cope with the demand for its services, and many women were being turned away untreated. At that time, such hospitals served the dual purpose of improving medical care for women and enhancing career prospects for female medical practitioners, as many hospitals refused to employ women.Elston MA. 'Run by Women, (Mainly) for Women: Medical Women's Hospitals in Britain, 1866‚Äì1948' in Clio Medica/The Wellcome Series in the History of Medicine, Vol. 61, 'Women and Modern Medicine' (Conrad L, Hardy A, eds), pp. 73‚Äì107(35), Rodolpi Since the foundation of the New Hospital in 1872, the rationale for women-only hospitals had evolved from protecting feminine modesty to providing treatment choices for women, reflecting the growth of feminism during this period. Aided by Davies-Colley's cousin Harriet Weaver, publisher of The Freewoman, and other feminists, enough money was raised to open an outpatients' department in Newington Causeway in 1912.Elston MA (2004) 'Colley, Eleanor Davies- (1874‚Äì1934)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press (accessed 20 August 2007) A caustic letter to The Times from a medical practitioner who declared the project to be unnecessary, as any demand for women to treat women was an artificial result of women forcing themselves into medicine, seems to have sparked the major donation: ¬£53,000 for building plus a ¬£40,000 endowment. With such generous funding, progress was swift: a purpose-built eighty-bed hospital on Clapham Common, designed by architect ME Collins, was opened by Queen Mary on 4 July 1916.Derelict London: Hospitals (accessed 18 August 2007) Staffed entirely by women, it was the ninth general women's hospital in Britain to be run in this way, and the largest, thanks to the size of its endowment. Weaver became their first Honorary Secretary. The South London Hospital included not only charity wards where patients paid only what they could afford, but also private rooms for which patients paid a set fee of 1‚Äì3 guineas per week. This reflected a trend in the later wave of women's hospitals (founded after the 1890s) towards treating a broader range of women, including the growing middle classes. The terms of the endowment strictly required that the hospital should employ only female doctors and admit only women, with the exception of children under seven. In fact, according to Chadburn's unpublished memoirs, the hospital's first inpatient only just qualified, being a boy of almost seven who had been injured in an accident involving a laundry van (cited by Elston). Interwar years and the Second World War After the First World War, the hospital expanded, with new departments being added for dermatology (1922) and urology (1924). Radium treatment for cancer was performed between 1924 and the opening of the specialist Marie Curie Hospital in Hampstead in 1929. The hospital buildings were enlarged when the imposing Wrennaissance Baroque style frontage building (designed by leading 20th-century architect Sir Edwin Cooper ‚Äì architect of the Port of London HQ opposite the Tower of London and another grand hospital building in Greenwich which is of a very similar style) was opened in 1929. Only 3/4 of this building was completed leaving the southern end-pavilion missing creating an unsightly gap for the remainder of the 20th Century. Further extensions were completed in the 1950s. By the 1930s, however, the need for wholly female-staffed hospitals to provide positions for women had reduced greatly, as equality of career opportunities for women in mainstream, mixed-staffed hospitals started to emerge, and the future of such hospitals began to be called into question. Although several women-only hospitals began to admit men during the 1930s, the South London Hospital's fundraising was sufficiently effective to allow it retain its original staffing policy. The terms of its founding donation were so strict that Chadburn claimed an Act of Parliament had been required for male soldiers to be treated during the Second World War (cited by Elston). National Health Service and closure When the National Health Service (NHS) took over hospital provision in 1948, hospital care became free at point of use and remaining restrictions on hospital appointments by gender in mainstream hospitals were formally removed. These changes obviously had an enormous impact on the need both for women-only hospitals and for the provision of charitable care. The South London Hospital, like most other women-only hospitals, was absorbed into the NHS. Although the NHS legislation did include some provision for maintaining the objects of the original institutions, where practical, the new regionally based administration made this problematic. Many women-only hospitals were closed, merged with other mixed hospitals, or required to admit male staff. The South London Hospital escaped these fates for more than three decades. In 1982, 3674 and 1953 new outpatients, respectively, attended the departments of gynaecological and genitourinary medicine.Boyd J, Hicks E, Louden M. (1984) South London Hospital for Women Br Med J 288: 74 (accessed 21 August 2007) The women-only staffing policy was retained until the hospital's closure, when it was one of the very few general hospital in Britain to remain wholly staffed by women. It fostered what three employees described in 1984 as 'that unique liaison and co-operation that is so striking a feature of the hospital.' The all-women wards served by an entirely female nursing and consultant staff also seem to have been popular with the public; a petition protesting against closure was signed by 60,000 people, and the hospital building was occupied for nine months by protesters.Indymedia: Women from San Francisco and London Join Women in Ireland Against War, Occupation, Deportation... (accessed 21 August 2007) The South London Hospital was closed in 1984, deemed uneconomic by Wandsworth Area Health Authority, a claim disputed by three employees in a letter to the British Medical Journal. A \\"work in\\" was organised in 1984 and the buildings were occupied by protestors until 27 March 1985. Redevelopment The original hospital building was by leading architect Sir Edwin Cooper, and has been described as a 'most impressive landmark building and a good example of neo-classical 1920s architecture'.Bird E. (1998) 'Appeal decision: demolition of unlisted historic buildings in a conservation area rejected' Context 59: 21 (accessed 21 August 2007) In 1998 Tesco attempted to win permission to demolish the hospital to the ground and replace it with a tower block of flats and a new store but this was strongly contested by Lambeth Council, local residents and amenity groups at a major public inquiry. Lambeth and the Clapham residents won their fight and Tesco agreed to retain Cooper's frontage of 1929. In 2004 the Cooper building was refurbished and the missing pavilion was finally completed, 75 years after the original building was opened. This, and the removal of the awkward ambulance entrance ramp and clumsy porch, which was replaced by an elegant flight of steps with classical balustrade designed by leading conservation architect Giles Quarme, improved the appearance of this landmark. English Heritage refused to list the building so Lambeth was unable to save the interiors including an Elizabethan style wooden staircase, fine panelled Board Room and the Outpatients waiting hall with chequer-board floor and barrel vaulted ceiling which were all destroyed. The frontage block was converted into flats above a Tesco supermarket and the ward blocks behind were all demolished to build a new block of flats with large car park for Tesco.South London Hospital for Women Clapham Common (accessed 21 August 2007) See also * List of hospitals in England References External links *Ideal Homes: Suburbia in Focus: South London Hospital for Women, Clapham, 1925 (with photograph of the hospital in 1925) 1912 establishments in England Defunct hospitals in London Hospital buildings completed in 1916 Women in London Women's hospitals Children's hospitals in the United Kingdom ","title":"South London Hospital for Women and Children"},{"id":"12866153","text":"Shaka (c. 1787 ‚Äì c. 1828) was the leader of the Zulu Kingdom in the early 19th century.

Brood parasites such as cuckoos, which use multiple host species to raise their chicks, evolve different gentes, each one specific to its host species. This specialisation allows the parasites to lay eggs that mimic those of their hosts, which in turn reduces the chances of the eggs being rejected by the hosts. The exact mechanisms of the evolution and maintenance of gens is still a matter of some research. However, it is believed that in common cuckoos, gens-specific properties are sex-linked and lie on the W chromosome of the female. Male cuckoos, which like all male birds have no W chromosome, are able to mate with females of any gens, and thereby maintain the cuckoo as one species. This is not the case in other brood parasites, such as cowbirds, in which both the male and female imprint on their preferred host. This leads to speciation, such as the indigo bird, which is suggested by the fact they have a more recent evolutionary origin than their hosts. References *Gibbs et al.

It was their first release for Hamburg, Germany‚Äìbased Sky Records. French Skyline was recorded in 1978 and 1979. The opening track, \\"Latin Sirens Face The Wall,\\" was recorded at Klaus Schulze Studios in Hamb√ºhren, West Germany, and was engineered by Klaus Schulze. Bass and strings were recorded at Aura Sound Studios in New York City. All other tracks were recorded at Depont√© la Rue Studio in Paris, France. Additional recording took place at four different studios in Germany and New York State. The album was released by Sky Records in 1979. French Skyline strongly shows Klaus Schulze's musical influence on Craig Wuest and Earthstar. Wuest's idea was to create a wall of sound, as described by the New Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock: \\"...his desire apparently is to create music that doesn't necessarily suggest a particular instrument, rather creates a new texture. Therefore, though there are credits for flute, guitar, bass, violin, viola, French horn, sitar and vocals, it's pretty hard to distinguish any of these.\\" French Skyline was also the first of three albums on which Wuest made heavy use of the Mellotron and the rare Birotron, a variation on the Mellotron that can sustain notes beyond eight seconds. Klaus Schulze's presence is almost certainly a large part of the reason French Skyline is Earthstar's most successful album in terms of sales. Sky Records licensed a reissue on CD by Musique Intemporelle in 1999 without the approval or knowledge of Earthstar.

During 2008 he was executive director of Seeds of Compassion, a public event hosting the Dalai Lama held in Seattle to promote compassion in early childhood development and in communities. Prior to his work in the field of education, he held executive level positions with the City of Seattle and Rainier Bank/Security Pacific Bank. Family and education Rajinder (Raj) Singh Manhas was born on April 15, 1948 in Paldi, Punjab, India, one of seven children of Daljit Kaur Manhas and Jaswant Singh Manhas. In August, 1947, due to the division of British India, his Sikh farming family were displaced from their land and home in a village named ‚ÄúChak 14/66‚Äù near Syedwala, in the newly proclaimed country of Pakistan. Migrating as refugees to India, the Manhas family settled in a village named Saroya, a village in the Himalayan foothills of northern India, near Garhshanker, in the Punjab region. He spent his early grade school years in his birthplace Paldi, and then graduated from Government High School, Saroya, with distinction and at the top of his class. He completed his pre-engineering at Lyallpur Khalsa College, Jallandar, Punjab, and a degree in aeronautical engineering from Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh, India. He completed a two-year research and teaching assignment at the same college, and then moved to the United States to complete a master's degree in Industrial Engineering at the University of Washington with a business focus in June 1975. His first job after graduation was at Rainier National Bank (later Security Pacific Bank) in a management consulting role. Later he held various leadership positions at that bank, including his final position as regional manager for internal operations for four states. Educational leadership In October 2003, Raj Manhas was formally hired as Superintendent by the School Board in Seattle, WA. Manhas had served as Interim Superintendent since June 2003, when the School Board had asked him to replace previous superintendent Joseph Olchefsky who had resigned following the disclosure of an audit detailing weaknesses in financial management at the district that led to a $34 million budget shortfall over two years. Previous to becoming Superintendent, Manhas had served as Chief Operating Officer for Seattle Public Schools, starting in October, 2001. Over the next four years, Manhas led the School District in facing a series of administrative and financial challenges. He was credited with closing the budget shortfall, balancing the District's annual budget, and returning the District to financial health with $20 million in reserves, as well as focusing the district on what he called \\"child-centered education.\\" However, his administration was also marked by controversy over plans to close a number of neighborhood schools due to declining enrollment along with rising costs for educating students. He announced his resignation as superintendent in October 2006 and ended his term in June, 2007. In April 2008, Manhas served as executive director of Seeds of Compassion, a series of events over four days when the Dalai Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and other influential thinkers including well known brain and social scientists came together for an unprecedented five-day gathering in Seattle to engage the community in an in- depth conversation on compassion. 150,000 attended various events organized by Seeds of Compassion, and 44 million interacted with the Seeds of Compassion online broadcast. In June 2009, Manhas became Superintendent of North Thurston Public Schools, a school district that provides educational services for Lacey and parts of unincorporated Thurston County, Washington, including students from the Nisqually Tribe Reservation and nearby Joint Base Lewis-McChord. North Thurston is the 23rd largest school district in the state of Washington, with more than 14,000 students. In an interview with the Olympian newspaper at the beginning of his new job, Manhas announced that \\"one of his goals for the district, besides academic improvement, is to foster a school system that helps students develop socially and emotionally.\\" Over the next seven years, Manhas led the District to improve student academic performance and test scores while persuading local voters to approve a 20-year, $175 million bond measure to remodel five schools and build a new middle school. Manhas retired as Superintendent in June 2016.

The film was shot in black-and-white, although the finale was in Multicolor. The film is preserved at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. The surviving print lacks the color finale; no footage is known to survive. The film was based on the 1927 stage production of the same name. Another film based on the musical, also called Good News, was released in 1947. By the 1940s, the 1930 production was not shown in the United States due to its Pre-Code content, which included sexual innuendo and lewd suggestive humor.

He was a deputy in the National Assembly of France for the first district of Yonne for several terms between 1968 and 2012; mayor of Auxerre from 1971 to 1998; President of the Regional Council of Burgundy (1992‚Äì93 and 1998‚Äì2004); and national minister of youth, labour, public administration and agriculture.CV at National Assembly website .  Life and political career  Soisson was born in Auxerre. A member of the centre-right Independent Republicans and later the Union for French Democracy (UDF), he was first elected to the National Assembly in the June 1968 parliamentary election and was re-elected nine times until 2007. He first entered the government under the Presidency of his fellow party member Valery Giscard d'Estaing when he became Secretary of State for Universities on 27 May 1974, serving that position until 12 January 1976. He was Secretary of State near the Prime Minister, in charge of Vocational Training, from the latter date until 25 August 1976 and then Secretary of State near the Minister for Quality of Life, in charge of Youth and Sports, until 29 March 1977. He was Minister of Youth, Sports and Leisure from 5 April 1978 to 13 May 1981. After Socialist Fran√ßois Mitterrand's re-election as president seven years later, Soisson returned to the government, taking part in Mitterrand's so-called ouverture, i.e. inclusion of centre-right politicians in predominantly left-wing governments. He became Minister of Labor, Employment and Vocational Training on 29 June 1988, in which position he served for three years before becoming Minister of State, Minister of the Civil Service and Administrative Modernization on 17 May 1991. He remained in that position until 29 March 1992. Later in that year he became Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development on 2 October, serving until 29 March 1993. Soisson was Mayor of Auxerre from 14 March 1971 to 5 April 1998. He was also Vice-President of the General Council of Yonne from 1 January 1983 to 27 June 1988, then Vice-President of the Regional Council of Bourgogne from the latter date until becoming president in March 1992, in which position he served until 17 April 1993. He was again President of the Regional Council of Bourgogne from 16 March 1998 to 28 March 2004, and he remains a member of the Regional Council. However, his alliance with the National Front between 1998 and 2004 in order to keep his seat in the Regional Council of Bourgogne tarred his career, and owed him to be excluded from the Union for French Democracy (UDF), along with Charles Baur, Jacques Blanc, Charles Millon and Bernard Harang.Ces politiques d√©barqu√©s de leurs partis, Le Figaro, 23 November 2006 UMP, FN et connivences, L'Humanit√©, 28 November 2006 Soisson was finally beaten in 2004 by Fran√ßois Patriat.

The album was a success, reaching #1 on the Top Heatseekers Albums chart, and #21 on the Billboard 200, thanks to the hit single, \\"Good Vibrations\\". Alongside \\"Good Vibrations\\", the album spawned an additional top-ten single, \\"Wildside\\" (#10 on the Billboard Hot 100), as well as the minor hits, \\"Peace\\" and \\"I Need Money\\". The album was certified platinum by the RIAA on January 14, 1992. \\"Good Vibrations\\" was Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch's first single, and after its release it went to number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song, and most of the album, was produced by Mark Wahlberg's brother, Donnie Wahlberg, who is part of the group New Kids on the Block.  Background  Before the group was even formed, Mark Wahlberg, who was the lead singer, was in jail for beating a Vietnamese man. Even before Mark got arrested, he dropped out of school at the age of 14 and began hustling, stealing, and selling drugs. Once Mark got out of prison, his older brother Donnie helped him out by getting him involved in the music business. Mark wasn't the best singer, but with his charisma and looks, Donnie helped him and his group debut their first album. In 1990, Donnie Walhberg convinced younger brother Mark to return to the music scene as Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, even landing them a spot as opening act for Donnie's band New Kids on the Block. Mark Walhberg (Marky Mark) was joined by an all black ensemble including Scott Ross (aka Scottie Gee), Hector Barros (Hector the Booty Inspector), Anthony Thomas (Ashley Ace), and Terry Yancey (DJ-T) to create more of a \\"street\\" feel for Mark. The following year Donnie went a step further, producing the group's first and most successful album, Music for the People. Reception Music for the People released on July 23, 1991 to mixed reviews. Despite being lauded more for Mark's physique, and charisma than musicality, the album still managed to receive a Platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. MTV's Jason Ankeny says‚ÄúRap purists were appalled by Wahlberg's mediocre lyrical skills, lame samples, and tired beats.‚Äù In an interview with Oral Tradition, DJ Romeo says that he believes Marky Mark‚Äôs disjointed rhythm and rap cadence comes primarily from reading the rap from paper while recording, and that while some rappers use ‚Äúpoets tools,‚Äù (simile, hyperbole, and alliteration) Marky Mark ‚Äújust raps.‚Äù The album was the only real successful thing that the group accomplished with its two big hits \\"Good Vibrations\\" and \\"Wildside\\". The group started to tank a couple years after their platinum album and split up in 1993 when Mark Wahlberg decided to take his career in another direction by starting to act.

These were substantial sized tank engines, and weighed ( after rebuilding) and were in length. There were six locos in the class. They were built by Robert Stephenson and Company and are sometimes referred to as the Rhymney Stephensons even though Hudswell Clarke and Beyer, Peacock and Company contributed many of the derived designs. Numbering The locomotives were numbered 16, 106‚Äì110 by the Rhymney. All passed to the Great Western Railway in 1922, and were renumbered 33, 47‚Äì51 in order. Three locomotives were taken into British Railways stock in 1948 and were numbered 33, 47 and 51. Overview of RR classes The M class and related 1909 R class and 1910 A class were successful designs ideally suited to hauling heavy coal trains a relatively short distance. In 1930 M class No 47 was reboilered by the GWR and in this form was visually almost indistinguishable from the GWR 5600 Class. Thus the M, R (and closely related A and A1) were designed for mineral working on the fifty mile long main line of the railway from Cardiff to Rhymney, replacing smaller locomotives. The larger wheeled but otherwise similar P class was designed for passenger working. When the smaller railway companies were forcibly merged into the Great Western Railway, these modern 0-6-2's were in generally good order and had proved successful. Collectively they became the blueprint for the 200 strong 5600 class. The design of the 5600 class followed the Rhymney designs quite closely but adopted GWR practice as far as possible, by utilising many standardized parts. Included in Collett‚Äôs innovations was a standard number 2 boiler which was suitable for the 5600 (and the M and R class Rhymney locomotives), complete with the traditional copper GWR safety valve casing and copper-capped chimney. Fifteen A class and all eight P's were also rebuilt, but used the slightly shorter standard number 10 boiler, also to good effect. Although only one M was rebuilt, five R class locos were upgraded from 1926 onwards. All told thirty from the four classes were similarly dealt with between 1926 and 1949. Welsh 0-6-2T types The railways of South Wales seem to have had a particular liking for the 0-6-2T type. The first was in 1885 on the Taff Vale Railway the design being by their mechanical engineer Tom Hurry Riches, father of the designer of the Rhymney Stevensons. The suitability of the type was because the nature of the work they undertook demanded high adhesive weight, plenty of power with good braking ability, but no need for outright speed, nor large tanks or bunker as the distances from pit to port were short. These Welsh locomotives were taken over by the GWR at the grouping in 1923 and many including seventeen of the Rhymney A, M, P and R's were rebuilt with GWR taper boilers. All the Rhymney Stephenson derived locos passed into British Railways (BR) ownership in 1948. Others included (with some gaps in numbering): * Brecon and Merthyr Railway, BR numbers 431-436 * Cardiff Railway, BR number 155 * Rhymney Railway, BR numbers 35-83 * Taff Vale Railway, BR numbers 204-399 For further information on these pre-grouping locomotives see Locomotives of the Great Western Railway.

Early life  A Nuer from Kuanylualthoan, Ret Chol had his earliest education in Ethiopia during which he came in contact with some Seventh-day Adventist missionaries who later baptized him. After completing his high school in Ethiopia he went to Lebanon to study at the Middle East Union College of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Ret Chol was the first Sudanese to become a baptized Seventh-day Adventist. After completing his major in business administration he came back to Sudan and started the first Adventist church group that worshipped in a house in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.  Political career  While he was the first to embrace the privilege to share the ministry of the Adventist Church with his fellow Sudanese, something else was creating an impact on his life as a person. There were privileges for him to work in the government and he did his best to see that the opportunity did not slip away. Because of his involvement in the politics, he was unable to effectively work as a missionary. However, his values and beliefs did not change. He became a government official in Malakal, the capital city of the Upper Nile State. Three years later he was appointed to be the deputy Commissioner for Nasir County. He had some political rivals like Joshua Dei Wal (also from Nasir). When the war broke out in The Jongulei Capital Mading Bor, Mr. Chol came to Khartoum and was appointed as the Minister of the local governments. He later won the title of the Upper Nile State governor. This was the regime of Sadiq El-Mahdi the former Premier of Sudan. = Contemporaries = Ret Chol had many friends who themselves were from the Nuer community. These are John Gilla Lul, David Koak Guok, Peter Lam Nguth, Kueth Kang, Daniel Koat Duoth and others Like William Nyuon Bany. Many of Nasir politicians lost their lives during the civil war that started in 1983 in Bor. Due to the competition and political marginalization, many Nuer politicians were unable to pursue their careers because of so much nepotism.  Later years  On June 30, General El Bashir took power and removed El- Mahdi from his post as prime minister. Ret Chol, a civilian politician was unable to gain any place in the government of The National Salvation Revolution. In early 2000s, he was appointed an ambassador before his death in May 2004. Ret Chol did not side with any political group.

The market sits on the Blackwattle Bay foreshore in Pyrmont, 2 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district. It is the world's third largest fish market. Features Terrace next to the portSydney Fish Market incorporates a working fishing port, wholesale fish market, fresh seafood retail market, a delicatessen, a sushi bar, a bakery, a gift shop, a fruit and vegetable market, a florist, a new meat deli, a beverage outlet, a seafood cooking school, indoor seating and an outdoor promenade for visitors. There are daily wholesale auctions for Sydney's seafood retailers. History = Earlier fish markets in Sydney = Seafood Display at Sydney Fish Market The original Fish Market was established, in 1871, at Woolloomooloo, then and for many years later the mooring site of the local Sydney fishing fleet. It expanded over time to occupy the block bounded by Bourke, Plunkett, Forbes and Wilson Streets, Woolloomooloo. Unhygienic conditions at the Woolloomooloo market and the extension of railways to the coastal areas to the north of Sydney led to the formation, in 1891, of a second, more modern, privately- owned fish market‚Äîknown as the 'Southern Fish Market'‚Äîlocated at Redfern Street, Redfern. In 1892, the Woolloomooloo market was expanded for the last time, then becoming known as the 'Eastern Market'. The Sydney City Council had passed a bylaw requiring that any fish sold in Sydney was first inspected at the Woolloomooloo market, jeopardising the railway-based business model of the Redfern market and its ability to directly market fish from Botany. In 1897, the 'Southern Market' buildings were for sale at auction but the market operations continued, opening a new building in 1903. Around 1907-1908, the Woolloomooloo market was taken over by the Sydney City Council, without compensation; that led to the exodus of some agents to the 'Southern Market', which was further expanded in 1910 after being incorporated as Commonwealth Cooperative Fish Exchange Limited in 1908. A newer Municipal Fish Market, opened in 1911, at the corner of Thomas and Engine Streets in the Haymarket area; it was also known as the 'City Fish Market'. It was a part of the produce market complex that the Sydney City Council had constructed in the Haymarket. The original market at Woolloomooloo continued to operate, but in a greatly diminished form. For a time, Sydney had three separate 'fish markets'; the privately-owned market at Redfern was in open conflict with the City Council, owner of the 'City' and old Woolloomooloo markets. The Council had the backing of the N.S.W. State Government, which passed an Act‚ÄîThe Sydney Corporation (Fish Markets) Act, 1922 (Act No. 39, 1922)‚Äîthat empowered the City Council to acquire the assets of Commonwealth Cooperative Fish Exchange Limited and to centralize fish marketing operations in Sydney at the Municipal Market. The end of the 'Southern Market' came in early 1923.The Colonial Secretary of NSW, Charles Oakes, had refused to renew licences of fish agents who operated at the Redfern market and the Fisherman's Union agreed to only supply fish to the 'City Fish Market', which subsequently became a profitable monopoly; that forced the Redfern agents to move to Haymarket and the City Council purchased the disused Redfern market building. The Redfern market building became a hostel for the unemployed during the Great Depression. The dormant 'Eastern Market' site at Woolloomooloo was sold to John Wren in 1926. The Fish Market remained in Haymarket, until it relocated to its current location at Blackwattle Bay in 1966. = Current market at Blackwattle Bay = 260x260pxThe wholesale marketing of fish in Sydney originally was in the hands of licensed agents at Haymarket. At places other than Sydney, unlicenced operators‚Äîmost typically fishermen's cooperatives‚Äîmarketed fish. The Fish Marketing Authority was established in 1964, by the NSW State Government, and it established a regulated wholesale market. The new organisation relocated the Fish Market to Blackwattle Bay in 1966. During the 1980s, new buildings were erected. These both provided an improved auction floor and expanded the secondary role of the Sydney Fish Market as a visitor attraction and retail venue. Until 1989, fish was sold, under a traditional 'voice' auction, to the highest bidder. A computerised Dutch auction system was introduced in October 1989, greatly increasing the efficiency of the sale process. The Sydney Fish Market was privatised, in 1994, as Sydney Fish Market Pty Ltd. This company is owned in equal parts by the harvesting and marketing sectors of the N.S.W. seafood industry‚Äîthe Catchers Trust of N.S.W. and the Sydney Fish Market Tenants and Merchants Pty Ltd. Between 1997 and 1999, fish marketing was deregulated in stages and the Sydney Fish Market lost its monopoly in Sydney. However, the efficiency and scale of the auctioning operations at Blackwattle Bay means that a large amount of seafood still goes through the Sydney Fish Market. Although it draws over 3.5-million visitors per year, in recent years, there has been criticism of the aesthetics and environmental aspects of the market facilities. Earlier plans to upgrade the market site have not eventuated and the site has been described as dirty and smelly; authentic perhaps, but not an ideal tourist destination.  Future planned redevelopment  On 7 November 2016, the New South Wales Government announced the market would move to a new 35,000 sq m complex on an adjacent site. The new complex will include 15,500 sq m of seafood retail space ‚Äì compared with 6582 sq m of space for the existing site. On 17 June 2020, the New South Wales Government approved the final plans for the new markets.The New Sydney Fish Market Sydney Fish Market The redevelopment forms part of the New South Wales Government's Bays Precinct urban renewal program.  Mural  The mural inside Sydney Fish Market was designed by Australian artist Keith Howland. It is made up of about 400 hundred individually glazed ceramic tiles and measures eight metres long and four metres wide and was installed in 1990. It took the artist about 12 months to complete and it depicts the fishing industry in New South Wales from Yamba on the Far North Coast to Sydney.

Combat chronicle The 21st Reserve Division fought on the Western Front, participating in the opening German offensive which led to the Allied Great Retreat and ended with the First Battle of the Marne. Thereafter, the division remained in the line in the Champagne region until June 1916. In July 1916, the division entered the Battle of Verdun. It returned to the Champagne in September and then went back to Verdun in December 1916-January 1917. In the Spring of 1917, the division fought in the Second Battle of the Aisne, also known as the Third Battle of Champagne. In November 1917, the division saw action in the tank battle at Cambrai. The division participated in the 1918 German Spring Offensive. It faced the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, and fought in the Second Battle of the Somme (1918) (also called the Third Battle of the Somme). Allied intelligence rated the division as second class.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 318-321.

The term may be applied in reference to a particular event or situation, or to a larger status quo. In Western philosophy and jurisprudence, injustice is very commonly‚Äîbut not always‚Äîdefined as either the absence or the opposite of justice.McCoubrey, Hilaire and White, Nigel D. Textbook on Jurisprudence. Second Edition. Blackstone Press Limited. 1996. . Page 276. The sense of injustice is a universal human feature, though the exact circumstances considered unjust can vary from culture to culture. While even acts of nature can sometimes arouse the sense of injustice, the sense is usually felt in relation to human action such as misuse, abuse, neglect, or malfeasance that is uncorrected or else sanctioned by a legal system or fellow human beings. The sense of injustice can be a powerful motivational condition, causing people to take action not just to defend themselves but also others who they perceive to be unfairly treated. Injustice within legal or societal standards are sometimes referred to as a two-tiered system. Relationship with justice Professor Judith Shklar has written that Western philosophers tend to spend much more time discussing the concept of 'justice' rather than 'injustice'. On the other hand, she states both historical writing and fiction use instances of injustice as subject matter far more often than justice. In philosophy and jurisprudence, the dominant view has been that injustice and justice are two sides of the same coin‚Äîthat injustice is simply a lack of justice. This view has been challenged by professors including Judith Shklar, Thomas W Simon and Eric Heinze, who consider that justice and injustice are independent qualities. So, in this minority view, you can increase the justice of a situation without reducing the injustice. Heinze has even gone as far as to argue that an increase in justice can actually cause an increase in injustice. A relatively common view among philosophers and other writers is that while justice and injustice may be interdependent, it is injustice that is the primary quality. Many writers have written that, while it is hard to directly define or even perceive justice, it is easy to demonstrate that injustice can be perceived by all. According to von Hayek, the earliest known thinker to state that injustice is the primary quality was Heraclitus, whose view was echoed by Aristotle and dozens of others down the centuries. Hayek said that writers often express the idea that injustice is the primary concept \\"as though it were a new discovery\\", suggesting the view is rarely directly expressed in theories on Justice. But Hayek went on to say that legal positivism has proved that injustice, not justice, is the primary quality.See Chapter 8 \\"THE QUEST FOR JUSTICE\\" in Vol 2 of von Hayeks's The mirage of social justice (University of Chicago Press, 1978). For a list discussing dozens of writers who have stated down the centuries that injustice, not justice, is the primary concept, look out for the long footnote under the sub heading \\"Rules of just conduct are generally prohibitions of unjust conduct\\" Sense of injustice A metaphorical injustice eating the innocent in Guillaume Rouill√©'s Justicie atque Iniusticie. The legs of the beast include adolesc√©s sine obedi√©tia (disobedient youth) and plebs sine disciplina(undisciplined commoners). Scholars including Judith Shklar, Edmond Cahn and Barrington Moore, Jr. have surveyed anthropological and historical work on injustice, concluding that the sense of injustice is found everywhere there are men and women; it is a human universal. These writers, and others like Simone Weil, Elizabeth Wolgast and Thomas W Simon, hold that the sense of injustice is a powerful motivational condition ‚Äî unlike the sense of justice which tends to be conceived in more abstract ways, and tends to inspire contemplation rather than action.Barnett, Clive. The Priority of Injustice: Locating Democracy in Critical Theory. (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 2017). Cahn held that, for evolutionary reasons, humans who witness others being subjected to injustice can respond as though it was an act of aggression towards themselves. There can be an immediate, visceral activation of the flight or fight system. As American civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr. wrote, in 1963, \\"injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere\\".Martin Luther King, Jr., Letter from Birmingham Jail (1963). Spinner-Halev spoke about enduring injustices where it will still persist to this day without any action to address them. A 2012 study published in Psychological Science found that even babies have a sense of injustice and dislike having it violated, even when they witness events that do not directly effect them. In the field of jurisprudence, Cahn has argued that it is an important skill for lawyers to know how to rouse a jury's sense of injustice ‚Äî something best done by appeals to the particular, not by abstractions or boilerplate type statements. Barrington Moore asserts that reasons why populations often submit to oppression for long periods of time is that they consider it inevitable and so their sense of injustice is not aroused. He says that a widely shared sense of injustice is an essential, though not sufficient, cause of rebellion. Writers including Simone Weil, Elizabeth Wolgast and Judith Shklar have said that an aroused sense of injustice can be an essential prerequisite to action needed for protecting the weak and afflicted. Causes A common cause of injustice is human selfishness. As Plato described at length in The Republic, people will often commit acts of injustice when they calculate it is in their interests to do so. Plato also adds that \\"The highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not\\". Human injustice is not always caused by attempt to gain unfair advantage or malice; it may be simply the result of the flawed human decision making. For example, studies have found that judges sitting on review boards are less likely to reach decisions favorable to applicants depending on how long it is since the judges had their last food break.\\"We find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ‚âà65% to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ‚âà65% after a break.\\" For more on the substantial difference in judges' decisions depending on time since last food break, see chpt 3 of Thinking, Fast and Slow. Misuse and abuse with regard to a particular case or context may represent a systemic failure to serve the cause of justice (cf. legal vacuum). Examples The Innocence Project provides a wealth of cases in which the U.S. justice system prosecuted and convicted the wrong person.

The players takes control of a duo (or squad) of undercover police officers who are assigned to rescue a group of kidnapped damsels from a crime boss and his army of punks. Much like Konami's arcade version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (released during the same year), the game was available in a four- player dedicated cabinet, as well as a conversion kit that was available in 2-player and 4-player versions (meant for either Atari Games' Gauntlet or Konami's own Main Event). Unlike Ninja Turtles, each player character is identical, save for each one sporting a different palette swapped color. Crime Fighters was followed by a sequel titled Vendetta (released in Japan as Crime Fighters 2). Gameplay In the four-player versions, each player position has its own coin slot and each credit value adds around a hundred health points to that position which slowly drains one health point per tick (similar to Gauntlet). Players are able to accidentally hit each other and cause allies to drop their weapons permanently. After defeating the boss at the end of each level, if the game has more than one current player then the players are given a time limit that refreshes when a player is hurt and tells the players to fight as long as they want and lose health. While some health is granted at the end of the time limit, it is possible to lose more health than granted during this fight. The two-player version gives players a set number of lives and the health/timer system is replaced with a life meter and life counter similar to other beat-em-ups. Players start in the first level of play, the subway. Upon knocking down the first few enemies, a large icon instructs player to kick downed opponents. There are buttons to punch and kick; pressing both performs a spinning jump kick. It is also possible to grab enemies and attack them, as well as kick them in the groin to stun them. Many enemies have weapons. Certain enemies always use knives to attack, while some \\"punk\\" enemies will have lead pipes and later enemies have handguns. Upon killing these enemies a player may pick up a weapon and use it indefinitely (including handguns in the two-player versions), however if players are hit once, the players will drop the item and it will disappear (except for the handguns in the four player versions, provided that they have ammo). In the final stage, the final boss throws a key to the players and tells them to pick it up. Doing so will allow the boss to pull out a machine gun and shoot at the players. Should the player run out of health at this point, the game will end and a bad ending will be seen with the final boss telling the players to try again. The player however can choose not to get the key and kick (or shoot if the player has a handgun) the main villain repeatedly until he is defeated. Upon winning the game, player will then be subjected to a difficult final all boss round where the players must kill every boss in the game, who all appear on screen at once. If all the bosses are beaten, the game will either end or repeat endlessly.

It resembles a tall thin bird and looks hornlike. The chofa is generally believed to represent the mythical creature Garuda, half bird and half man, who is the vehicle of the Hindu god Vishnu. History Roof finial or chofah (colorized) as depicted on the bas relief of Angkor Wat temple in 12th century. The representation of cho fah is unclear and believed to represent garuda, however, the present research indicates that the original chofah upon which most subsequent chofah have been based is the gajashimha of Suryavarman II, the Khmer king who built Angkor Wat. Temple finials representing gajashimha was presumably appeared in Cambodia during or shortly after his reign (1113 AD to 1150 AD). These finials (chofah) symbolized the unification of the northern and southern Khmer kingdoms and the reign of King Suryavarman II. This symbolism spread extensively throughout the region including part of today Laos, Lanna, and Isan which were once the Khmer empire. From 13th to 18th century, ceramic finials or chofah in the form of the gajashimha were largely produced in Sukothai, Sawankalok, and Ayutthaya. Today most wats or pagodas and palaces throughout Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand are adorned with these sacred finials at their roof end with many types and appearance.

The Internet infrastructure comprises software-driven networked switches, routers, firewalls, servers and storage hardware that switch, route, protect and store all voice, video and text data intelligently across the world. Internet equipment manufacturers like Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, etc.. have a quasi monopoly on the multi-Billion dollar software maintenance services market for networking equipment through their own maintenance contracts and authorized third party maintenance. Multiven is the only provider offering a one-stop alternative for businesses of all sizes. = The Multiven Open Marketplace = In March 2018, Multiven launched the development of the Multiven Open Marketplace, a blockchain project aiming to transition its existing business into a decentralized organisation. Multiven is developing a blockchain-based open Marketplace to allow customers to buy and sell new and pre-owned Information Technology hardware, software and services, on a peer-to-peer basis, without intermediaries, solely powered by smart contracts and one global Cryptocurrency, the Multicoin. Multiven's maintenance and cybersecurity services will be accessible on the platform and can be bound to any hardware device. A portion of the Multicoin transaction fees from the Multiven Open Marketplace, funds Multiven B-Fence, a program that proactively defends Bitcoin nodes and the routers that connect them to other nodes, against centralisation cyberattacks.  Controversies  =Antitrust lawsuit against Cisco Systems= On December 1, 2008, Multiven filed a United States Federal antitrust lawsuit against Cisco Systems, Inc. in an effort to open up the network maintenance services marketplace for Cisco equipment, promote competition and ensure consumer choice and value. Multiven's complaint alleges that Cisco harmed Multiven and consumers by bundling and tying bug fixes/patches and updates for its operating system software to its maintenance services (‚ÄúSMARTnet‚Äù) and through a series of other illegal exclusionary and anticompetitive acts designed to maintain Cisco's alleged monopoly in the network maintenance services market for Cisco networking equipment. In April 2009 during a Cisco-initiated mediation, Cisco offered Multiven a few million dollars as settlement and limited software updates for its customers but insisted that Multiven couldn't advertise its access to Cisco software updates. Multiven declined this offer as it still limited free and fair competition. The following month in May 2009, Cisco filed a set of false counterclaims against Multiven and alleged that in 2006 ‚ÄúMultiven‚Äôs CEO or someone under his control‚Äù viewed Cisco's ‚Äòprotected‚Äô public website 99 times and downloaded Cisco IOS five times with a total value of $14,000, using a Cisco-employee provided credentials. = Cisco Fabricated Criminal Charges against Multiven CEO = Cisco went on to communicate exactly the same false allegations in its civil counterclaims to a local US prosecutor in San Jose and after several months in which US authorities prevented Peter Alfred- Adekeye's re-entry into the country for participation in Multiven v. Cisco, a special hearing in the case took place at a Canadian hotel from 18‚Äì20 May 2010, involving a US special master and four Cisco lawyers. On 20 May 2010, Cisco accused the person who filed the antitrust suit of hacking and orchestrated his arrest from the court session by Canadian police based on a misleading US arrest warrant while in the middle of testifying against Cisco in Multiven's antitrust hearing. Alfred-Adekeye was released after 28 days in custody but was forced to remain in Canada for another year before he was allowed to return to his home in Zurich, Switzerland. On May 31, 2011, Mr Justice Ronald McKinnon of the Supreme Court of British Columbia stayed the extradition, ruling that the strict standard of \\"extraordinary misconduct\\" was met by the circumstances and speaking of the \\"audacity of it all\\", of \\"Cisco's duplicity\\", and the \\"shocking\\" act of preventing someone's participation in a judicial proceeding by arresting them. False material in the US attorney's letter had misled the judge who signed the Canadian arrest warrant. \\"Grotesquely inflated\\" charges and the unjustified portrayal of Alfred-Adekeye as a Nigerian-born scam artist and flight risk had misled the Canadian judicial system further. The underlying civil case by Multiven against Cisco had been withheld from them. = Cisco Settles Multiven v. Cisco = On July 19, 2010, Cisco settled Multiven's antitrust lawsuit by making its operating system and application software updates, bug fixes and patches available to all Multiven customers worldwide. This settlement agreement transformed Multiven into Cisco's first and only independent competitor in the multi- Billion dollars per year software maintenance services business. = Libel Lawsuit Against Cisco = On July 20, 2015, Multiven CEO, Peter Alfred-Adekeye initiated a libel lawsuit against Cisco for (1) falsely claiming that ‚Äòhe or someone under his control at Multiven‚Äô downloaded and ‚Äòstole‚Äô Cisco software five times in 2006 from cisco.com (2) used this lie (a) to orchestrate his illegal arrest in Vancouver, Canada in 2010 during Multiven v. Cisco and (b) to fabricate an ‚Äòindictment‚Äô in August 2011 after the Canadian Supreme Court threw out Cisco/US Government's extradition request and (3) continuing to knowingly propagate this falsehood till today, with the core purpose of defaming Mr Alfred-Adekeye's character and that of Multiven's - Cisco's only competitor in the global multi-Billion dollar per year services business.

Conner & David Hatfield Sparks, Queering Creole Spiritual Traditions: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered Participation in African Inspired Traditions in the Americas; (Haworth Press, Binghamton, New York, 2004); Afro-Cuban-American artist specializing at painting, drawing, engraving, installation and graphic design. Boza studied at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes \\"San Alejandro\\" from 1960 to 1962 and then from 1962 to 1964 at the Escuela Nacional de Arte (ENA) both located in Havana, Cuba. He was expelled from San Alejandro due to \\"political issues\\" and became a lithographer with the Experimental Graphic Workshop in 1965. Boza was fired as a result of the Congress of Education and Culture which convened in 1971 and led to the censorship of many artists in Cuba. In the years between 1971 and his exodus from Cuba in 1980 Boza restored religious statues to earn a living. In 1980 Juan Boza managed to escape Cuba to New York via the Mariel boatlift. Boza described New York as a \\"tremendous shock\\" and upon arriving in New York \\"had to re-build Juan Boza from scratch.\\" Boza began developing an Afro-Cuban theme that he realized was part of his culture after leaving Cuba, as well as his participation in the Santeria (also known as Lukum√≠) religion. According to Jaun Boza, \\"There is no distinction between my faith and my aesthetics.\\" He lived in New York City from 1980, when he arrived during the Mariel boatlift until his death, at Brooklyn Memorial Hospital, working at the Printmaking Workshop, the Lower Eastside Printshop and the Art Student League. Exhibitions In 1964, Sanchez presented a personal exhibition in the Galer√≠a Provincial de Camag√ºey in Cuba. Four years later, he created \\"Stopper: Gouaches, Drawings and Lithographies,\\" shown at the Gallery of Havana. In 1983, Sanchez exhibited \\"Juan Stopper: Black Mysticism\\" at the Latin Inter-American Gallery in New York. In 1984, his art was exhibited at the Museum of African Americans in Buffalo, New York. In 1990, he presented \\"Juan Boza's World\\" at the Ollantay Gallery in New York. Sanchez also participated in many collective exhibits. He first group showing was in the 1960 Freedom for Siqueiros at the Seguro M√©dico Building in Havana. In 1970, he exhibited pieces in Sal√≥n 70 at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Havana; in 25 Latin American Engravings at the Gallery Pablo Picasso in Mexico; and in the Fourth American Biennial of the Engraving in Santiago, Chile. In 1975, he participated in the Ninth International Print Biennial at the Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo, Japan.

He is the third Asian American and first Japanese American to be appointed to a United States Court of Appeals. Early life Atsushi Wallace Tashima was born in 1934 in Santa Maria, California, to Yasutaro and Aya Tashima. He is Nisei Japanese American. During World War II he was interned at the Poston War Relocation Center in Arizona, an internment camp for Japanese Americans. After the war his family moved to Southern California. He lived in Boyle Heights, graduating from Roosevelt High School in East Los Angeles. From 1953 to 1956, Tashima served in the United States Marine Corps, and was honorably discharged with the rank of sergeant. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1958, and a Bachelor of Laws from the Harvard Law School in 1961. Career Upon graduation from law school, from 1962 to 1968, Tashima became the Deputy State Attorney General for the State of California. He then joined the Amstar Corporation as an attorney in its Spreckels Sugar Division (1968‚Äì1972) and then as the general attorney and vice president of Amstar from 1972 to 1977. Tashima returned to private practice in 1977, as a partner at Morrison & Foerster, in Los Angeles. Federal judicial service Tashima was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on May 9, 1980, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Central District of California vacated by Judge Warren J. Ferguson. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 26, 1980, and received commission on June 30, 1980. His service terminated on January 8, 1996, due to elevation to the Ninth Circuit. Tashima was nominated by President Bill Clinton on April 6, 1995, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated by Judge Arthur Lawrence Alarc√≥n. He was confirmed by the Senate on January 2, 1996, and received commission on January 4, 1996. He assumed senior status on June 30, 2004. Notable cases *Donald Walden Jr. v.

Judge Tashima wrote, ‚ÄúAt the very least, it is clear that the statute potentially criminalizes the simple words ‚Äì spoken to a son,a wife, a parent, a friend, a neighbor, a coworker, a student, a client ‚Äì ‚ÄòI encourage you to stay here.‚Äô‚Äù He also wrote that the statute appeared to apply to statements amounting to ‚Äúpure advocacy on a hotly debated issue in our society.‚ÄùJosh Gerstein (Dec. 4, 2018). ‚ÄúFederal appeals court rules against another immigration crackdown attempt‚Äù. ‚ÄúPolitico‚Äù. *Gonz√°lez v.

The park is on Grist Mill Road (CR 46) off State Route 76 about 4 miles (6 kilometers) northeast of the city of Childersburg. Both structures, dating back to the American Civil War, were restored in 1974 and were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 29, 1976. The Childersburg Heritage Committee purchased the tract in 1988, and with help from the Alabama Historical Commission and the Talladega County Commission, established Kymulga Park. More structural renovations were made as well. There is an admission charge to visit the park, with proceeds being used for upkeep of all structures and nature trails within this historic recreation area. Kymulga Park was acquired by the City of Childersburg in June 2011. It is currently managed by the Childersburg Historic Preservation Commission. Kymulga Mill Kymulga Mill is a working gristmill built in 1864 by German contractor G.E. Morris for Confederate Army Captain George H. Forney, who was later promoted to lieutenant colonel. Forney died at the Battle of the Wilderness in Virginia before construction was completed, but his wife allowed Morris to finish it. Union Army soldiers burned most of the gristmills throughout the area during the Civil War, but Kymulga Mill was missed. The mill was sold four times before being purchased by the Childersburg Heritage Committee from latest owner Edward Donahoo in 1988, though it remained in active service through many of those years. Three water powered turbines ran the four-story mill, including lights, grain elevator and millstones used for grinding grain. Two of its five sets are French buhrs, thought to be the hardest rock in the world. Kymulga Mill continues to operate to this day, though under electricity, still making corn meal with its huge millstones. The building is now a tourist attraction open for guided tours. It also serves as a gift shop and park office. Kymulga Covered Bridge The Kymulga Covered Bridge is a wood & metal combination style covered bridge that spans Talladega Creek, located just east of Kymulga Mill within Kymulga Park. Built in 1861, the 105-foot (32 m) bridge is a Howe truss construction over a single span. See also: The Kymulga Covered Bridge is one of two 19th-century covered bridges extant in Alabama still remaining at its original location; the Waldo Covered Bridge, also located in Talladega County, is the other. The bridge once provided access to the Old Georgia Road or the McIntosh Road, a Native American trade route which was used by settlers and frontiersmen who ventured the area. Eventually, farms and communities spawned along the former trail. The United States government purchased land adjacent to Kymulga Mill in 1941 for the Alabama Ordnance Works, a military installation. Settlements within the tract had to be relocated. Today, the Kymulga Covered Bridge leads park visitors to a series of nature trails north of Talladega Creek. People may still find remnants of the Old Georgia Road, as well as other traces of the past.

Zion just outside the walls of the Old City near the Zion Gate. Between 1998 and 2006 the community was known as the Abbey of Hagia Maria Sion,Or \\"Assumption\\" in reference to the Basilica of Hagia Sion that stood on this spot during the Byzantine period, but it resumed the original name during the 2006 celebrations of the monastery's centenary. Hagia Maria Sion is now the name of the foundation supporting the abbey's buildings, community and academic work. History of the site The Byzantine basilica Hagia Sion was built under John II, Bishop of Jerusalem in the early 5th century. Relics attributed to Saint Stephen were transferred to the church on 26 December 415. The church is shown in the 6th-century Madaba Map. It was destroyed in the 614 siege of Jerusalem by Sasanian king Khosrau II. Its foundations were recovered in 1899, when architect and building's manager of the Diocese of Cologne, (1868‚Äì1928), investigated the site. Connected with this is the thesis of Bargil Pixner of a pre-Crusader Church of Zion.Bargil Pixner, Wege des Messias und St√§tten der Urkirche. 2., erweiterte Auflage. Brunnen, Giessen 1994, pp. 110f. A monastic order known as the Abbey of Our Lady of Mount Zion was established at the site in the 12th century, with a church built on the ruins of the earlier demolished Byzantine church. The 12th century church was again destroyed in the 13th century, and the monks moved to Sicily. The order was eventually absorbed into the Jesuits in 1617 (the Congregation of Notre-Dame de Sion is an unrelated monastic order founded in 1843).M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© nationale des antiquaires de France, tome XLVIII. The File Reference Number to this article in the French National Library in Paris is 8-O2F-762. The order was chosen as the namesake of the \\"Priory of Sion hoax\\" created by French esotericist Pierre Plantard during the 1960s.see e.g. Carl E. Olson, Sandra Meisel, The Da Vinci Hoax, 2004 (book and video documentary). , and the main Priory of Sion article for details. Modern building Exterior of the church. Interior of the church. During his visit to Jerusalem in 1898 for the dedication of the Protestant Church of the Redeemer, Kaiser Wilhelm II bought this piece of land on Mount Zion for 120,000 German Goldmark from Sultan Abdul Hamid II and presented it to the \\"German Association of the Holy Land\\" (\\"Deutscher Verein vom Heiligen Lande\\"). According to local tradition, it was on this spot, near the site of the Last Supper, that the Blessed Virgin Mary died, or at least ended her worldly existence. Both in Orthodoxy and Catholicism, as in the language of scripture, death is often called a \\"sleeping\\" ‚Äì or \\"falling asleep\\" ‚Äì and this gave the original monastery its name. The church itself is called Basilica of the Assumption (or Dormition). In the Catholic dogma of the Assumption of Mary, Christ's mother was taken, body and soul, to heaven. Renard delivered the designs and plans for the Abbey, the direction of construction was entrusted to the architect , a member of the Temple Society and a resident of Jerusalem. The foundation stone was laid on 7 October 1900. Construction was completed in only ten years; the basilica was dedicated on 10 April 1910 by the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. The Abbey was built in an ecclesiastical, neo- Romanesque style that had become the state style of the new Imperial Germany. The present church is a circular building with several niches containing altars, and a choir. Two spiral staircases lead to the crypt, the site ascribed to the Dormition of the Virgin Mary, and also to the organ-loft and the gallery, from where two of the church's four towers are accessible. Out of regard for the nearby Jewish and Muslim sacred place of David's Tomb, which occupies part of the ground floor of the Cenacle, where it has traditionally been said that the Last Supper took place, the belltower is set far enough away that its shadow does not touch the tomb, and is therefore not directly accessible from the church. Benedictine community The first monks had already been sent to Jerusalem in 1906 from Beuron Archabbey in Germany. They were interned for the first time in 1918‚Äì1921, after the end of World War I. In 1926 the monastery was raised to the status of an abbey within the Beuron Congregation. Between 1939 and 1945, the German monks were interned for the second time, and then for the third time as the result of the 1948 Arab- Israeli War<1947-1949>. The abbey was located in the Israeli-controlled territory on mount Zion, across from the Jordanian-controlled territory within the walled city. In 1951, the abbey was separated from the Beuron Congregation and placed under the direct supervision of the Abbot-Primate of the Benedictines in Rome. The community elected its own abbot for the first time in 1979. Theology seminar Since 1973 the abbey has been hosting an ecumenical year of study for outstanding students of theology from Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The curriculum encompasses biblical, Eastern Orthodox Church, Judaic and Islamic studies. Vandalism The Dormition Abbey, along with other Christian sites, has been the target of occasional vandalism as a form of price tag attack by extremist Israeli nationalist religious youths. In October 2012 and in May and June 2013 the abbey was vandalized with anti- Christian graffiti and insults in Hebrew.Another Israeli church defaced with 'price tag' graffiti, Oz Rosenberg and Nir Hasson, Oct. 3, 2012, Haaretz The offensive words compared Christians to monkeys and called for revenge against Jesus. Two cars were also covered with graffiti and all tyres were slashed. One of the gates of the nearby Greek Orthodox cemetery was also marked with graffiti. This was allegedly a price tag attack carried out by nationalist religious extremists for the dismantling of an illegal outpost Havat Ma'on.\\"Jerusalem's Dormition Church suffers suspected 'price tag' attack.\\" Nir Hasson and Gili Cohen, 31 May 13, HaaretzIndependent Catholic NewsSuspected ‚Äòprice tag‚Äô attacks reported in Jerusalem, West Bank, May 31, 2013 JTA On 26 May 2014 a box of wooden crosses was set ablaze inside the Dormition Abbey. It is believed that this was some sort of failed arson attempt. At the same time of the arson attempt, Pope Francis was conducting a service in the building next door in the upper room of King David's Tomb. A nationalist religious jew entered the premises by jumping over a fence in December 2014 and went on to damage a crucifix, a bench and a number of statues in the cemetery, one of which marked the grave of a monk with Israeli nationality. In January 2016, vandals wrote slogans on the walls of the Abbey such as \\"Death to the heathen Christians the enemies of Israel\\" and \\"May his name be obliterated\\" (whose first letters in Hebrew spell the name of Jesus).

Early years Jauretche spent his childhood and adolescence in the city of Lincoln before moving to Buenos Aires. He sympathized with the new model of social integration promoted by the Radical Civic Union and allied himself with the radical faction of Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen, the so-called personalistas. He was influenced by the poet and Tango lyricist Homero Manzi, whose working-class appeal struck Jauretche, himself of rural origin, as a positive political strategy. In 1928, when Yrigoyen assumed his second mandate following the interlude of Marcelo T. de Alvear, Jauretche was appointed to the civil service, though it was not long before the Argentine army unseated Yrigoyen in a coup, setting off the D√©cada Infame. Jauretche joined the armed struggle against the coup, and subsequently opposed the regime with intense political action. In 1933, in the province of Corrientes, he took part in a failed uprising led by Colonels Francisco Bosch and Gregorio Pomar. Jauretche was imprisoned for his role in the uprising. In prison, he wrote a poetic account of the episode in the gauchesque style, titling the work Paso de los Libres. It was published in 1934 with a prologue by Jorge Luis Borges, with whom Jauretche differed markedly in political matters. FORJA Jauretche's clash with Alvear's leading faction quickly radicalized him. When Alvear decided in 1934 to abandon the UCR's policy of abstentionism, a significant portion of the left split from the party. Along with Manzi, Luis Dellepiane, Gabriel del Mazo, Manuel Ortiz Pereyra and others, Jauretche founded FORJA (an acronym for Fuerza de Orientaci√≥n Radical de la Joven Argentina), which pursued a democratic nationalist ideology equally opposed to conservative nationalism and to the economic liberal policies of Agust√≠n P. Justo. Marginalized by the partisan political system, FORJA expressed its positions mainly through street demonstrations and self-published literature known as Cuadernos de FORJA, or FORJA Notebooks. In them, FORJA criticized the government's measures, beginning with the Roca-Runciman Treaty. They argued that the Central Bank had been founded to solidify British control of the Argentine monetary and financial system, and that the Transport Corporation had been established to allow British railways to operate without competition. FORJA opposed the breaking off of relations with the Soviet Union, on the basis that the Soviet bloc was a major potential market for Argentine agricultural exports. They alleged that Justo's government had abused the policy of federal intervention to punish provinces where anti-government parties had enjoyed electoral success, and blamed Justo for dropping wages and rising unemployment. One of FORJA's fundamental principles was the maintenance of Argentine neutrality in the run-up to the Second World War, and it was the only party to adopt this position. Around 1940 Jauretche broke with Dellepiane and del Mazo, who realigned themselves with the UCR. FORJA became further radicalized, and shifted towards more nationalistic positions. Ra√∫l Scalabrini Ortiz, who had always shared a similar ideology, affiliated himself with the party, and along with Jauretche formed a double leadership. He departed in 1943, leaving Jauretche in control. He vehemently opposed the government of Ram√≥n Castillo. Although he was skeptical of the motives of the coup that unseated Castillo, his firm neutrality with regard to the war led him to welcome the government of Pedro Pablo Ram√≠rez. When the Grupo de Oficiales Unidos unseated Ram√≠rez after he severed relations with the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis, Jauretche allied himself with the up-and-coming Colonel Juan Domingo Per√≥n. Per√≥n's government Though he was always critical of it, Jauretche supported Peronism after October 17, 1945. With the support of Domingo Mercante, governor of Buenos Aires Province, he was named president of the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires in 1946. He would hold the position until 1951, when Mercante's falling out with Per√≥n led Jauretche to abandon it. Opposition to Aramburu and exile Jauretche did not return to the public scene until 1955, when the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora led to Per√≥n's ouster. Having been out of government for a few years meant that, for once, he was able to avoid political persecution. He founded the periodical El L√≠der and the weekly El '45 to defend what he called \\"the ten years of popular government\\", and to excoriate the political, economic, and social activities of the de facto regime. In 1956 he published the essay El Plan Prebisch: retorno al coloniaje (\\"The Prebisch Plan: a return to colonialism\\"), refuting the report written by Ra√∫l Prebisch, secretary of the Economic Commission of Latin America, at the behest of Pedro Eugenio Aramburu. The harshness of his opposition led him to be exiled to Montevideo. There in 1957 he published Los profetas del odio (The prophets of hate), a polemical study of class relations in Argentina since the rise of Peronism. In it he criticized various conceptions of Argentine political history which had enjoyed favor, in particular that of Ezequiel Mart√≠nez Estrada. Estrada had previously subjected Argentine history to a bio- sociological analysis in his Radiograf√≠a de la pampa, which resembled Sarmiento's Facundo, in its suggestion that the Argentine geography had imposed upon its inhabitants a life disconnected from the flow of history. In his subsequent work ¬øQu√© es esto? he presented a devastating critique of Peronism, in which he portrayed Per√≥n as a \\"snake charmer\\" whose political movement had instigated the \\"low passions of the populace\\", corruption, and \\"pornocracy\\". Jauretche criticized these allusions as the prejudices of a middle class sensibility irritated by the eruption of new participants in a political environment which had been exclusively run by the bourgeoisie since the generaci√≥n del '80. Although bourgeois material interests had been advanced by the development of a dense layer of consumers, they nevertheless remained reticent towards the habits of the working classes, a \\"myopia\\" which Jauretche would criticize frequently. He also challenged, in a friendly letter to the scientist and writer Ernesto S√°bato, the notion that the middle classes had embraced Peronism out of resentment towards the wealthy: Jauretche's proposal was one of integration, whereby the common interest of the bourgeoisie and proletariat would be served by the development of a solid national economy. This position, which was difficult to reconcile with the populism of Peronism, attracted the enmity both of economic liberals and the justicialist leadership. In Los profetas del odio, Jauretche identified the chief enemies of national development as the liberal and cosmopolitan intelligentsia, whose fascination with European culture led them to apply European solutions uncritically to Argentine problems, without consideration for historical differences and the continents' distinct places in the international community. Jauretche and revisionism Jauretche combined his own interpretation of contemporary reality with the nascent techniques of historical revisionism. Although revisionist authors had been advocating a reinterpretation of Argentine history -- in opposition to the canonical vision of Bartolom√© Mitre and Sarmiento which had represented the nation's development in terms of a clash between civilization and barbarism -- since at least the 1930s, it was not until the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora that major parallels began to be drawn between Per√≥n and Juan Manuel de Rosas. When Aramburu's supporters declared the coup against Per√≥n \\"a new Caseros\\", the revisionists rose to the challenge, portraying Caseros as the beginning of a historical disaster that the government of Rosas had kept at bay through a policy that united the interests of disparate social classes. In previous decades, when the national identity had been based on the simultaneous opposition to British capital and European immigration, historical revisionism had been allied with the conservative nationalism of the creole aristocracy. The upper classes soon came to adopt a liberal economic and social outlook, and the work of Jauretche and the Forjistas proved pivotal in realigning historical revisionism with populism, taking in the struggle the labor movement and the montonera tradition. In Per√≥n's government, this spirit of reform was stifled by pragmatic considerations, a situation predicted by Jos√© Mar√≠a Rosa and others. Subsequently the politicization of historical interpretation would become more evident, in keeping with the profound cultural and political radicalization that characterized the period. In 1959 Jauretche published National Policy and Historical Revisionism, in which he elaborated on his own place at the center of the deeply divided revisionist movement, speaking as much about the grass-roots movement he made possible as about actual historical questions. Though he painted a fairly sympathetic portrait of Rosas, described as the only \\"possible synthesis\\" of the problems facing his time, Jauretche was fairly critical of the federal caudillos of the interior; in this analysis, Jauretche distinguished himself from the position of Jorge Abelardo Ramos, Rodolfo Puiggr√≥s, and Rodolfo Ortega Pe√±a, who were at the time critical of Rosas's ideology, which they understood as an attenuated version of Porte√±o centralism, and deeply fearful of the atavistic foundations of traditional nationalism, in which they perceived no small similarities with Fascism. In the struggle between revisionism and anti- revisionism, which in a large part was a division between left and right, Jauretche left no doubt as to his allegiance with the former. Meanwhile, in pursuit of whatever means would most quickly bring about the end of the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora, Jauretche broke with Per√≥n one last time and endorsed the candidacy of Arturo Frondizi, whereas Peronists adopted abstentionism, the technique traditionally used by the Radical Civic Union. Nevertheless, after Frondizi's election, Jauretche was severely critical of his development program and his pursuit of foreign investment, particularly with respect to petroleum. In 1961, during a bitterly contested election in which the Peronist vote was divided among various candidates, Jauretche endorsed the socialist Alfredo Palacios. Writing When his political career was cut short, Jauretche returned to literature. During the 1960s he published frequently and prolifically, contributing to journals and periodicals as well as releasing highly successful collections of essays. In 1962 he published Forja y la D√©cada Infame, two years later Filo, contrafilo y punta, and in 1966 El medio pelo en la sociedad Argentina, a probing inquisition of the role of the middle class which immediately elicited a strong reaction. A supporter of the Confederaci√≥n General del Trabajo de los Argentinos, he took part in the syndicate's Comisi√≥n de Afirmaci√≥n Nacional. Works *1934: El Paso de los Libres.

Although names of real people are used, the story by Joyce Hooper Corrington and John William Corrington makes no claim to be historically accurate, and in fact is largely fictional.Corman 1978, p. 224. Plot In 1916, Manfred von Richthofen is newly assigned to a German air squadron under the command of Oswald Boelcke. Across the lines, Roy Brown arrives at a British squadron under the command of Lanoe Hawker. The two pilots are very different; Richthofen is a gentleman who respects tradition and believes in a gentlemanly approach to war, while Brown is a cynical, cocky, ruthless rebel without a cause who doesn‚Äôt believe in honor. Boelcke is killed after a mid-air collision and Hawker is killed by Richthofen. Richthofen assumes command of the squadron and becomes outwardly energized by the war. Outraged by an order to camouflage his squadron's aircraft, he paints them in bright conspicuous colors, claiming that gentlemen should not hide from their enemies. Later, Richthofen dances with Ilse and even kisses her. Brown bullies his way to leadership and has his squadron hunt in packs with a plane as bait. Richthofen suffers a skull wound during an aerial battle, and when he returns to combat, he begins showing troubling signs of memory loss and confusion. After Brown and his squadron attack Richthofen's airfield, destroying their aircraft on the ground, Richthofen, with the help of a batch of new fighters from Anthony Fokker, launches a counterattack on the British airfield. Back at their aerodrome, Richthofen rebukes fellow pilot Hermann G√∂ring for strafing medical personnel. Richthofen's passion for the war fades, becoming dismayed and depressed that his squadron is losing so many pilots. He refuses a job offer from the government deciding to help fight alongside his men, knowing it will probably lead to his death in combat. Caught between his disgust for the war, and the responsibility for his fighter wing, Richthofen sets out to fly again. Brown becomes very uncooperative, developing a rather defeatist attitude. On April 21, 1918, Richthofen and Brown engage in an aerial duel during which Richthofen is mortally wounded by Brown but, as his final act, manages to land his aircraft before he dies. The Allied pilots congratulate Brown, while the German squadron mourns Richthofen‚Äôs death. Richthofen is buried with full military honors by the Allies, and G√∂ring assumes command of the squadron.

Lynn Garrison is second from right, front row. Lynn Garrison, Don Stroud crash September 16, 1970 SV4.C Stampe Roger Corman had been interested in making a film about Manfred von Richthofen for a number of years. He felt that the Baron was the last true knight, an aristocratic warrior with a code of honor, and wanted to show how the Baron's way of thinking was archaic compared to the wholesale slaughter of World War I. Another thing he wanted to do was to contrast the Baron with the man who had been credited with shooting him down, Canadian RAF pilot Roy Brown, although it is now considered all but certain by historians, doctors, and ballistics experts that Richthofen was actually killed by an AA machine gunner firing from the ground. In 1965 it was announced he had commissioned a script called The Red Baron from Robert Towne.\\"Movie Call Sheet: Spiegel to Film 'Swimmer'.\\" Los Angeles Times, D13, March 19, 1965. He pitched the project to 20th Century Fox along with the St Valentine's Day Massacre; Fox decided to make the latter, as they already had The Blue Max. Years later Corman signed a deal with United Artists who liked the idea of a film about the Red Baron but did not want the film to be too German, so Corman agreed to make it about Roy Brown and other characters from both areas of the battle front that could be added to the script. Although the story of the two foes who meet in a fateful last flight, was essentially a historical subject, Corman's intention was to treat the subject as an allegory of the modern war machine in conflict with antiquated old world notions of chivalry.Hyams 1984, p. 188. Work on the film went ahead, with Corman able to work with a much larger budget than he enjoyed with his earlier features.Smith, Richard Harland. \\"Articles: 'Von Richthofen and Brown'(1971).\\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: July 6, 2014. Ex-RCAF pilot Lynn Garrison supplied the aircraft, crews and facilities, and personally coordinated the flying sequences; Garrison had purchased the collection of hangars, aircraft, vehicles and support equipment accumulated for filming 20th Century‚Äôs top- grossing film, The Blue Max, after the production wrapped in 1965. The collection included replica Pfalz D.IIIs, Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, Fokker D.VIIs, Fokker Dr.Is. A number of de Havilland DH.82A Tiger Moths and Stampe SV.4Cs had also been converted to represent other aircraft, for a total of 12 aircraft available for aerial scenes.Hardwick and Schnepf 1989, pp. 52, 54.\\"Celluloid Over the Western Front.\\" Air Progress, October 1979, p. 53. As with \\"The Blue Max,\\" flying sequences were based at Weston Airport in Ireland. Richard Bach, author of Jonathan Livingstone Seagull, was one of the film's stunt pilots, and wrote about some of his experiences at Weston during its production.Richard Bach, \\"I Shot Down the Red Baron, and So What\\" in \\"A Gift of Wings\\", Dell Reissue 1989, First edition 1974; Kindle pp. 23, 27 and 29 United Artists who were financing the picture turned down Bruce Dern who was Corman‚Äôs original choice for Roy Brown. Don Stroud - whom Corman had selected to play Richthofen - was given the role instead and John Phillip Law was cast as the Baron. United Artists also insisted on re-dubbing the actors' voices with fake German accents in post-production.Frank, Alan. The Films of Roger Corman. Batsford (1998) =Shooting= For the aerial sequences, Corman used an A√©rospatiale Alouette II helicopter, along with a Helio Courier, for the photography, supported by a number of specialized camera mounts Garrison developed for use on individual aircraft. This allowed footage of actors, such as John Philip Law and Don Stroud \\"flying\\" the aircraft. Garrison trained Law and Stroud to the point where they could take off, land a Stampe, and fly basic sequences themselves from the rear seat, filmed with a rear-facing camera. Stunt pilots such as Bach were used for the more complicated sequences. Corman used a filming schedule that included so-called \\"Blue Days, Grey Days and Don‚Äôt Give a Damn Days\\" so that the aircraft were used no matter what the weather presented. =Accident= On 15 September 1970, Charles Boddington, a veteran of both The Blue Max and Darling Lili, was killed when his S.E.5 spun in during a low-level manoeuvre over the airfield. The next day, during the last scheduled flight on the shooting schedule, Garrison and Stroud were involved in a low-level sequence across Lake Weston in a Stampe, when a jackdaw struck Garrison in the face, knocking him unconscious. The aircraft then ran through five powerlines, snap rolled and plunged into the River Liffey inverted. Garrison and Stroud were rescued from the water. Stroud was uninjured, but Garrison required 60 stitches to close a head wound. Both incidents occurring in such a short period resulted in Irish authorities grounding the production. Corman lobbied for restoration of flying and a few days later, was successful.\\"Notes: 'Von Richthofen and Brown' (1971)\\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: 7 July 2014. Some of the interior shots in Von Richthofen and Brown were filmed at Powerscourt House, a noted stately home in County Wicklow Ireland. Powerscourt had been designed by Richard Cassels, a German architect, and the entrance hall had a Germanic motif, lending a visual connection to a German location. Some external shots were filmed outside the Irish parliament building, Leinster House. A sex scene between Law and Karen Huston was edited out after it caused an American preview audience to laugh.Frank, Alan. The Films of Roger Corman. Batsford (1995) Corman found the movie exhausting. He later said \\"by that time I had directed somewhere be- tween fifty and sixty films in, I think, twelve or thirteen years... I was so tired, I remember each day as I drove out from Dublin, and I'd come to a fork in the road. One way was the airport where we were shooting and the other was to Gallway Bay. Each day I came to that fork in the road I thought I would just like to drive to Gallway Bay. I barely completed the film, so I said to myself, I will complete this film, but I'm going to take a year off, the traditional sabbatical rest.\\" Although heavily involved as a producer during the interim, he did not direct another film until Frankenstein Unbound (1990).Corman 1978, p. 234. Reception Von Richthofen and Brown received mixed to negative reviews from both viewers and critics, although Roger Greenspun, in his review for The New York Times saw Corman's work as \\"... an extraordinarily impressive movie by a filmmaker whose career has not always been marked by success, or even noble failure.\\"Greenspun, Roger. \\"Movie Review: 'Von Richthofen and Brown' (1970)\\". The New York Times, July 29, 1971. Critics also connected Corman's anti-war views with the central characters of the film, seeing the antagonists as representing the modern relentless killing machine versus old world chivalry.Evans 2000, p. 195. As an aviation epic, reviewer Leonard Maltin noted, \\"Aerial work is excellent, it's the ground work which crashes.\\"Maltin 2009, p. 1149.

It was built in 1956 and was the headquarters of Buddhism in South Vietnam. The pagoda is located in District 3, H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh City and lies on a plot of 2500 square metres. The name X√° L·ª£i is the Vietnamese translation for ≈õarƒ´ra, a term used for relics of Buddhists. The pagoda is best known for the raids, in which the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces loyal to Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu, the brother of the Roman Catholic President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám, raided and vandalised Buddhist monasteries and pagodas on 21 August 1963.

Squads of Special Forces, led by L√™ Quang Tung and combat police flattened the gates and smashed their way into the pagoda at around 00:20 on 21 August 1963, as X√° L·ª£i's brass gong was clanged as a warning signal of the attack. Nhu's men were armed with pistols, submachine guns, carbines, shotguns, grenades and tear gas. The Special Forces were joined by truckloads of combat police in army camouflage uniforms.Jones, p. 297. Monks and nuns who barricaded themselves behind wooden shields were attacked with rifle butts and bayonets. The gong of the pagoda was drowned out by the burst of automatic weapons fire, the sound of exploding grenades, shattering glass and human screaming.Jacobs, p. 153. One monk was thrown from the balcony down to the courtyard six meters below. Nhu's men vandalized the main altar and managed to confiscate the intact charred heart of Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c, the monk who had self-immolated in protest against the policies of the regime. Two monks jumped the back wall of the pagoda into the grounds of the adjoining US Aid Mission, where they were granted asylum.

Across the country, hundreds were estimated to have died or vanished, and more than one thousand monks were incarcerated. =Administrative function= The pagoda served as the headquarters of the Vietnamese Buddhist Association until 1981, and as its second office until May 1993. Site The statue of Quan √Çm inside the fenced yard of the X√° L·ª£i pagoda The site includes a number of buildings, including the main ceremonial hall and the bell tower. The pagoda is separated from the street by a gated fence. Inside the fence is a popular Chinese-style statue of Quan √Çm holding a vial of elixir in one hand and making the gesture of removing obstacles with the other. The main hall of the pagoda is located on the upper level. Men ascend by the stairs on the left hand side, women by those on the right. The hall is rectangular in shape, and is supported by pillars. Facing the entrance is the shrine, which is dominated by a large statue of Gautama Buddha. =Shrine= The gilded statue of Gautama Buddha dominates the shrine. The statue of Gautama depicts the Buddha seated in meditation on a lotus blossom. He is wearing the garb of a monk. As usual, he is depicted with ears lengthened by the use of jewelry (indicating his royal origins), closely cropped curly hair (indicating renunciation of the worldly life), and a large protuberance on his head (indicating aptitude). Behind his head is a sun disc. This statue was crafted by sculptors from Bi√™n H√≤a, a city just north of H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh City. It has been in its current state since 1969, when a gold coating was applied to it. In front of the statue of Gautama Buddha is the shrine dedicated to the relics of the Buddha, with the relics being held in a small stupa. Towards the front of the shrine is a small porcelain image of the \\"Laughing Buddha\\" Maitreya, the Buddha of the future. Between the small statue of Maitreya and the large statue of Gautama is a golden image of multi-armed Cundi (Chuan De) bodhisattva sitting in meditation on a lotus blossom. The bodhisattva's many hands grasp familiar attributes such as the sword, the wheel, and the trident. Elegant Chinese-style vases on either side of the shrine hold flowers of various colors. =Scenes from the life of Gautama Buddha= The walls of the main hall play host to a sequence of large panels depicting fourteen scenes from the life of the Gautama Buddha, from his birth as Prince Siddhartha to his attainment of nirvana. The images were created by Dr. Nguyen Van Long of the Gia Dinh Art School. Arranged sequentially high on the two side walls, the images are reminiscent of the depictions of the life of Jesus or of the Stations of the Cross found in some Christian churches. The fourteen scenes are as follows: * Queen Maya, the mother of the historical Buddha, dreams that an elephant with six tusks enters her through her right side. * The young Siddhartha walks on open lotus flowers, pointing at the Heaven and the Earth. * The elder Asita notes the auspicious marks on the body of the infant Siddhartha that indicate he will be a great secular or religious leader. Prince Siddhartha sees an old man. * Prince Siddhartha sees an old man and a sick man, leading him to ponder the devastation to the human body caused by old age and disease. * The prince sees a corpse, and then a monk who is in perfect condition. * Having decided to renounce the secular life and to lead a life of religion, the prince looks for the last time upon his family as they lie sleeping. * Having left the royal city of Kapilavastu with his horse Kanthaka and horseman Channa, Siddhartha cuts off his long hair in order to symbolize his entry into the religious life. * Three demon princesses representing ambition, anxiety, and voluptuousness try unsuccessfully to seduce the prince. * Mara the king of demons and his minions attempt unsuccessfully to intimidate the prince by violence. * Having attained Enlightenment, Gautama Buddha preaches the Four Noble Truths to his first four disciples in the garden. * A young woman falsely accuses the Buddha of getting her pregnant, as the Buddha makes the gesture of calling upon the Earth as a witness; the Buddha instructs another young woman. * Elephants and other animals render hommage to Buddha; Buddha converts the venomous serpents. * The Buddha converts Angulimala, an armed assassin. * Lying on his side, the Buddha enters into nirvana. Above the entrance, facing the shrine itself, is an especially big image of Gautama Buddha seated in meditation underneath a fig tree. =Bell tower= X√° L·ª£i Pagoda's bell tower is visible from the street The bell tower of X√° L·ª£i Pagoda was opened in 1961. The tower stands 32 m, has seven stories, and is the highest bell tower in Vietnam. On the highest level, there is a bell weighing two tonnes, which was cast in the model of the bell of Thi√™n M·ª• Pagoda in Hu·∫ø.

Albinistic Dillenia indica in Pakke Tiger Reserve, Arunachal Pradesh, India Description It is an evergreen large shrub or small to medium-sized tree growing to 15 m tall. The leaves are 15‚Äì36 cm long, with a conspicuously corrugated surface with impressed veins. Its branches are used to make good firewood. The flowers are large, 15‚Äì20 cm diameter, with five white petals and numerous yellow stamens. Its characteristic round fruits are large, greenish yellow, have many seeds and are edible. The fruit is a 5‚Äì12 cm diameter aggregate of 15 carpels, each carpel containing five seeds embedded in an edible but fibrous pulp.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan .Flora of Pakistan: Dillenia indica Taxonomy Dillenia indica was one of the many species first described by Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae in 1759. Ecology Dillenia indica produces a large hard edible fruit which is accessible only to the megaherbivores in the wild. A study in the Buxa Tiger Reserve by ecologists Sekar & Sukumar has shown that Asian elephants appear to have a particular fondness for the fruits of D. indica, and are hence an important seed disperser for this tree. With the prospect of extinction of the elephants this tree has developed a back-up system, whereby its hard fruits that were only accessible to megaherbivores, slowly soften on the forest floor through the dry season to allow access to successively smaller animals such as macaques, rodents and squirrels. Seeds from both old and soft fruits are able to germinate well, enabling the persistence of this tree to be independent of the survival of its major megaherbivore disperser. Uses The fruit pulp is sour and used in Indian cuisine in curries, jam (ouu khatta), and jellies. Because it is a main source of food for elephants, monkeys and deer, collection of fruit from the core areas of the forest are prohibited. Commercial sale of the fruit is also prohibited in an effort to help the food- chain system of the forest from dismantling totally.
