It provides representation and advocacy on common statutory, regulatory, and technical matters of concern; develops standards including the code of practice; manages industry-wide research and reporting, including the collection of audience ratings data; and runs the . About Upon the introduction of public broadcasting in Australia, the control of wireless broadcasting was prescribed to the Department of the Postmaster-General through the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905. This was because broadcasting was perceived as an extension of an existing means of communication ‚Äî a domain conventionally controlled by the Post Office. In 1924, Australia introduced B-Class radio licences for stations that would be fully funded by advertising rather than by a listener licence fee. In 1928, B-Class licence holders decided to form a federation of state organisations, the Australian Federation of [\\"B\\"] Broadcasting Stations (AFBS), to represent and advance their common interests including against the A-Class licence holders. This was renamed in 1930 as the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations (AFCBS), and subsequently renamed to the Federation of Australian Commercial Broadcasters (FACB). The federation was established to represent and preserve the interests and rights of Australian licensed broadcasting stations. In so doing, the federation reflected the need for a unified industry approach to radio ‚Äî specifically with respect to the bifurcated broadcasting system, copyright and royalty payments. It changed its name to Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters (FARB), and subsequently to its current name in 2002. The organisation was founded to provide representation on such common concerns as use of the term \\"B-class\\", royalty and copyright payments, and transmitter requirements. By the middle of the decade, B-Class stations started to be referred to as \\"commercial\\" instead, but the older term remained in use until World War II. The organisation continued to provide industry representation and advice into the 1930s, and aimed for industry self-regulation. In 1936, it produced the industry's Code of Ethics, and in 1938 began accrediting advertising agents federally. The Federal government agreed in March 1939 to increased regulatory representation for the organisation, with an informal committee to consist of a technical representative from the Postmaster-General's Department, a representative from AFCBS, and a legally-trained Chairman. This did not, however, eventuate after changes of Minister. Industry self-regulation increased with the release of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, which allowed industry groups to develop codes of practice under section 123 of the Act. Such codes of practice are registered with and enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), the broadcasting regulator. CRA developed the initial codes of practice for commercial radio in 1993, and has released updated versions in 2004, 2010, and 2013. ACMA has, however, had difficulty in enforcing commercial radio's compliance with these codes of practice, in particular broadcasts made by Alan Jones and Kyle Sandilands. CRA manages the collection of audience ratings data. , this is performed under contract by GfK. CRA conducts the Australian Commercial Radio Awards for stations and personnel, and Siren Awards for radio advertising.

An example: Sometimes the dispatcher will mention the officer's honors and may add other words in memoriam. In some cases the call is made twice, once immediately after the officer's death, then more formally closer to the date of or actually at the officer's funeral.

The sack is on display at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington D.C. Rose filled the sack with a dress, braid of her hair, pecans, and \\"my love always\\". The gift was likely passed down to Ashley's granddaughter, Ruth (Jones) Middleton, who embroidered their story on to the sack in 1921. Ashley's Sack was given to Middleton Place, in Dorchester County, South Carolina, one of the nation's preeminent slavery-era plantation sites, in the mid-2000s. While still owned by Middleton Place, the sack is on long-term loan to the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington D.C. According to Tracey Todd, vice president of the Middleton Place Foundation, the sack is a rare material artifact from a period in United States history when human slavery was legal and families suffered extraordinary losses; the sack typifies the strength and endurance of inter- generational love. \\"The sack allows us to relate to the enslaved people and feel the same pain today ‚Äî if you have lost a child or been separated from a parent ‚Äî that Rose and Ashley felt\\", said Todd. \\"Ashley's Sack is a portal to understanding more about our shared history.\\"  History  Ashley's Sack was purchased for $20 at a flea market in Nashville in the early 2000s. Alarmed by the embroidered story of a slave sale separating a mother and her daughter, the woman who purchased the sack did an Internet search for \\"slavery\\" and \\"Middleton\\" and then gifted the sack to Middleton Place. On display from 2009 to 2013 at Middleton Place, the emotionally-charged artifact evoked human suffering and endurance. During this period, the identities of Rose, Ashley, and Ruth were unknown. It was viewed by thousands of museum visitors, including Central Washington University sociocultural anthropologist and museum-studies professor Mark Auslander, who has since traced the history of the sack to identify Ashley, her mother Rose, and the author of the needlepoint, Ruth. In the research article he published in 2016, Auslander uses census reports, wills, newspaper announcements of court decrees, and inventory records to reconstruct their history. The historical chains of remaining evidence suggest that Ashley and her mother Rose were enslaved by a wealthy Charleston merchant and planter, Robert Martin (c. 1790‚Äì1852), who was worth over $300,000 at his death in December 1852. After his death, evidence suggests Ashley was sold away from her mother in order to raise money for his heirs. Auslander's archival work retraces the life of Ruth. He posits Ruth Middleton was born Ruth Jones in Columbia, South Carolina, around 1903. Her parents, Austin and Rosa Jones, were servants at the University of South Carolina. Ruth made her way to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and married Arthur Middleton, who was born around 1899 and also from South Carolina. However, Ruth and her husband are never listed as having lived together. She had a daughter, Dorothy Helen, born in Philadelphia in 1919. In 1921, when Ashley's Sack was embroidered, Ruth would probably have been a single mother to a young daughter. Newspaper reports and census records suggest that throughout her life, Ruth worked in affluent households in Philadelphia. By 1928, she was well known in Philadelphia's African-American high society, gaining regular mention in the \\"Smart Set\\" and \\"High Society\\" pages of the Philadelphia Tribune, the leading African-American newspaper. Auslander writes that Ruth \\"host[ed] bridge and cocktail parties and [wore] elegant couture\\". Her daughter, Dorothy Helen, was also known for her fashion sense and authored several \\"Smart Set\\" columns. Ruth died in January 1942 of tuberculosis. Dorothy Helen died in 1988. Embroidery details Impact The sack is a rare, important material artifact in African-American history. The sack exemplifies the coming together of traditional oral and written history. Heather Andrea Williams describes the sack in the epilogue of her book Help Me to Find My People as a testimony to inter-generational loss and survival. Professor Mark Auslander emphasizes the importance of the sack, and the historical reconstruction of the lives of Ashley, Rose, and Ruth, as a conduit to understanding the endurance of family lineal memory \\"in the face of terrible fragmentation of family solidarity caused by the domestic slave trade\\". \\"It is an emotional object\\", said Mary Elliot, museum specialist with the Smithsonian, who worked on the Slavery and Freedom exhibit at the National Museum of African American History and Culture under curator Nancy Bercaw. \\"This piece is very important to telling that human story\\", Elliot said.

Neave was arrested in June 2017 on a Driving While Intoxicated charge after she allegedly crashed her BMW into a tree within district 107 at 11:30 p.m. She allegedly repeatedly told arresting officers that \\"I love you and I want to fight for you, and I invoke the Fifth Amendment.\\" Neave said after her arrest that she was \\"deeply sorry, and will accept the consequences of my actions, and will work to make this right.\\" As a local attorney and legislator, concerns were expressed at favoritism by police and prosecutors towards Neave. In its 2018 endorsement of Neve, the Dallas Morning News editorial board wrote that \\"She accepted full responsibility and didn't use her role as an elected official to try to get out of trouble.\\" Neave was reelected to her second term in the general election held on November 6, 2018, when she defeated the Republican candidate, Deanna Maria Metzger, 28,923 (57.1 percent) to 21,770 (42.9 percent). Neave was selected as one of seventeen speakers to jointly deliver the keynote address at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.

Winning Putt is developed by Webzen/Onnet, and Published in North America by Bandai Namco Entertainment America. Winning Putt is a free to play Online PC Golf Game, meaning there is no cost to download and play the game, but features microtransactions. The servers for Winning Putt were shut down permanently on December 14, 2018.  Gameplay  Winning Putt allows up to four players to tee-off together on several fictional golf courses. The game also features a social hub called \\"The Square\\" where player avatars can interact with other players and buy or sell items from various NPCs, or trade with other players. Players earn experience and gold, an in game currency, with each swing they take, and get bonuses on completing a hole or round of golf. When a player earns enough experience they will advance in level, and after level 5 begin earning training points to further advance their character's statistics. Gold can be used in game for a variety of items which can be purchased from other players or NPC shops. The actual game of golf makes use of a standard 3 click swing bar seen in many other golf games. Players click once to start their swing, again to set power, and a third time to set the accuracy of their shot. Classes can unlock skills by spending their training points in different stats. Skills allow player to change the way a base shot works, allowing players to curve the ball through the air intentionally, or even reduce the effect that flying through a tree can have on a ball. Skills are broken down into three types: Power, Accuracy, and Common. As the names suggest, each class gets their own unique skills while also gaining some from a pool shared between both. Winning Putt currently has 11 Courses of varying difficulty. Each course can be played on five different difficulties, which change the starting tee position, and the pin position.  Development  In-Game Screenshot of the User Interface Winning Putt was originally developed as a Korean title and then later marketed to the United States.

Art. 4ff. of the \\"Orlando\\" law of 14 July 1907, n. 511. The High Council is based in the Palazzo dei Marescialli, in Piazza Indipendenza 6.  History  The council was first named in Article 4 of law 511 of 1907, which instituted it along with the Ministry of Justice, essentially as a consultative organ, with a largely administrative role in the naming of individual officials within the judiciary. A few months later, Giovanni Giolitti's government passed law 689 of 1907Cf. royal decree of 10 October 1907, n. 689. which defined the new council. Although, obviously, it was to run the judiciary in the name of King of Italy, its members were arranged as dependents of the government. The council's functions remained largely unchanged until the Constitution of the Italian Republic of 1947, which radically transformed the council from a consultative-administrative organ of a ministry into a self-governing institution of the Italian judiciary.  Status The High Council is a self- governing institution in order to insure the autonomy and independence of the judiciary from the other branches of the state, particularly the executive, according to the principle of the separation of powers expressed in the Italian Constitution. The Council is an \\"Institution of constitutional importance\\" (Organi di rilievo costituzionale) as confirmed by the Constitutional Court, since it is referred to by the Italian Constitution.Articles 104‚Äì107. For many years it was disputed as to whether the High Council was a \\"Constitutional Institution\\" or merely an \\"Institution of Constitutional Importance\\" and the identification of specific problems with the Council was very problematic. In fact, the performance of some powers and functions by the Council, which are not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, has often caused political tensions. These include the \\"functions of representation of the judicial power in interactions with other powers\\",Pizzorusso like, for example, making proposals to the Minister of Justice on matters under his or her control, giving opinions on the drafting of laws relating to the judiciaryCf. Article 10 of Law 195, 24 March 1958 and generally pronouncing its opinion on any matter relating to the functioning of the judiciary.  Functions  Article 110 of the Constitution assigns the task of \\"the organisation and the running of services relating to the judiciary\\" to the Ministry of Justice, notwithstanding the powers of the High Council. However, article 101.2 guarantees the full autonomy and independence of judges from all other powers, saying that they \\"are subject only to the laws.\\" The High Council is the institution which ensures the autonomy of the judiciary, with responsibility for the Criminal and Civil branches of the Ordinary Judiciary. The Council has competence in matters relating to the criminal and civil judges (judges in the administrative, auditing and military courts have their own governing institutions, which are distinct from the High Council). These matters are: *appointment of magistrates (always through a public examination); *assignment of magistrates to a specific role; *promotions; *transfers; *subsidies for magistrates and their families; *appointment of magistrates to the Supreme Court of Cassation *appointment and removal of . The law establishing the Council allows the Minister of Justice to make requests and observations on matters under the Council's control; the minister can participate in sessions of the Council when asked by the President or when the minister considers it appropriate to communicate with it. The minister also has the power to present information to the heads of the courts about the functioning of the judiciary and to express agreement on the nominations of heads of judicial offices. Although the minister of Justice can suggest disciplinary action, it is up to the Council to decide whether to follow the suggestions of the minister. At the prompting of the minister of Justice, the Council has the power to identify disadvantaged locations in order to consider the transfer of judges to those locations. This means that the transfer may not have been requested by the judge (although they may have indicated their agreement or availability) and that the Council determines the disposition of magistrates in disadvantaged locations. The transfer must involve a change of Region and the new location must be more than a hundred and fifty kilometres from the location where the judge was trained or worked previously. The judicial offices considered to be \\"disadvantaged\\" are those of Basilicata, Calabria, Sicily, and Sardinia, where there has been a failure to fill the places available by examination, more than 50% of staff positions are unfilled, there is a high crime rate (especially related to organised crime), and a high rate of civil cases for the district's size and the number of staff. Appeal against these decisions can be made to the of Lazio in the first instance and the Council of State in the second instance.Article 2 of Law 90/2014 intervenes in compliance proceedings (solely for the provisional suspension of deliberations of the High Council), limiting operation solely to prevent the circumvention of future judgements. Appeal against disciplinary sanctions is through a separate process which includes eventual appeal to the court of cassation. Political role  There is often controversy when the Council intervenes in the political sphere, on the grounds of protecting the independence and autonomy of the judiciary from external attacks, and when the Council passes regulatory acts. There have been political attempts to limit the Council's ability to make regulations, such as the constitutional reform proposals of Massimo D'Alema (which were never approved). The Council has no right to make political pronouncements and therefore has no political role, strictly speaking, and does not establish or pursue any political objectives. However, under the constitution, the Council does have the role of governing the judiciary and protecting its autonomy and independence. Thus the Council has been accused by some politiciansIn one case, even by its own president, Francesco Cossiga, \\"The CSM had decided to discuss some matters inserted in the agenda, despite the veto of the President, but Cossiga declared that in the face of such clear illegality, he would denounce the 34 councillers to the judicial authority and call in the police to clear the council chamber. Cossiga had the support of the Minister of Justice, the President of the Council, and political forces of various orientations, such that in the end the CSM had to back down, adjourning the session and tabling the matters which the President had veto'd\\": Tito Lucrezio Rizzo, Parla il Capo dello Stato, Gangemi, 2012, p. 198 of playing a role which the constitution does not give it, extending its powers in order to conflict with those of Parliament and the Government. Criticism focusses on two types of activity of the Council: * The so-called \\"Papers for Protection\\" (pratiche a tutela) with which the Council intervenes to defend magistrates experiencing criticism for their judicial activities which it considers unfair; * The \\"Opinions\\" (pareri) on draft laws being considered by the Italian Parliament, produced without request. Especially when these express critical views of legislative activity, the reactions of the government and parliamentarians is very lively. In particular it is claimed that such activities are unconstitutional and indicate the Council's desire to make itself a \\"third chamber\\" (terza camera) of Parliament. Individual members of the Council and the often speak in defence of the Council's actions in these situations. Defence of the \\"Papers for Protection\\" claims that citizens' right to discuss and criticise judicial decisions should not extend to the delegitimisation of the judge who has issued the decision and that the autonomous governing institution of the judiciary ought to intervene to protect the autonomy and independence of the judiciary as a whole in these instances. The internal regulations of the Council, signed by the President of Italy in his role as President of the Council, explicitly permit the \\"papers for protection.\\" With respect to the \\"Opinions\\", the law which established the CouncilLaw 195, 24 March 1958 expressly states that the Council \\"should give opinions to the Minister on draft laws concerning the arrangement of the judiciary, the administration of justice and anything else relating to the aforementioned in any way.\\" Proponents argue that the Council ought therefore to express its opinions to the Minister of Justice so that they may take account of them in their discussions in Parliament. Critics argue that the \\"opinions\\" violate the separation of powers by intervening in the legislative process.  Composition  The High Council of the Judiciary is presided over by the President of Italy, ex officio. The First President and the of the Supreme Court of Cassation also sit on it by right of office. The other twenty-four members of the council are elected. Two-thirds of the elected members (the \\"togate members\\") must belong to the judiciary and are elected by all the ordinary magistrates. One third of the elected members (the \\"lay members\\") are chosen by a joint session of the Italian Parliament and must be university professors dealing with law or lawyers who have worked in the procession for at least fourteen years. These lay members are to ensure that the autonomous and independent judiciary nevertheless remains subject to the interests of the state and does not become a privileged caste. It is for the same reason that the President of Italy presides over the Council, although the President's role is mostly formal and symbolic, since the Council elects a Vice-President from among the lay members who performs all the functions of the council's president in practice. The Italian Constitution does not directly state how many members the Council should contain, just the proportion of togate and lay members, so this matter is regulated by ordinary law.Law 195, 24 March 1958, frequently amended, most recently by Law 44, 28 March 2002 Currently there are sixteen togate members (two are judges of the court of cassation, four are prosecutors, ten are trial judges) and there are eight lay members. Thus, the Council has a total of twenty-seven members. These members cannot be re- elected immediately after the end of their term and they cannot be parliamentarians or regional councilors. The elected members of the council serve a four-year term.  Members in office  Twenty-four counselors are elected, 8 lay members and 16 togate members; three members hold their position ex officio: the President of Italy, the First President and the Prosecutor General of the Court of Cassation. The current lay members of the council were elected by joint sessions of Parliament on 10, 11, 15 and 23 September 2014. The President of Italy is the council's presiding member, but the council elects one of its members as a Vice-President. * Ex Officio Members: President of Italy, Sergio Mattarella; First President of the Court of Cassation, Giovanni Mammone; Prosecutor General of the Court of Cassation, Riccardo Fuzio * Lay Members: David Ermini (PD), Alberto Maria Benedetti (M5S), Emanuele Basile (LN), Filippo Donati (M5S), Fulvio Gigliotti (M5S), Stefano Cavanna (LN), Alessio Lanzi (FI), Michele Cerabona (FI). The togate members were elected by the ordinary magistrates on 12 July 2018. The results were as follows: * For the Judges of Cassation: Piercamillo Davigo (A&I;) and Loredana Miccich√® (M Ind); * For the Prosecutors: Luigi Spina (UniCost), Sebastiano Ardita (A&I;), Antonio Lepre (M Ind) and Giuseppe Cascini (Area); * For the Trial Judges: Marco Mancinetti (UniCost), Paola Maria Braggion (M Ind), Giovanni Zaccaro (Area), Gianluigi Morlini (UniCost), Corrado Cartoni (M Ind), Michele Ciambellini (UniCost), Alessandra Dal Moro (Area), Mario Suriano (Area), Paolo Criscuoli (M Ind) and Concetta Grillo (UniCost).

The website claims over 207,000 contributing photographers and generates more than 17 billion photo impressions per month on their growing library of over 2 million photos. Unsplash has been cited as one of the world's leading photography websites by Forbes, Entrepreneur Magazine, CNET, Medium and The Next Web. Unsplash allows photographers to upload photos to its website, which are then curated by a team of photo editors. The permissive copyright terms on its photos have led to Unsplash becoming one of the largest photography suppliers on the internet, with its members‚Äô photos frequently appearing on articles. Nevertheless, their decision to stop using a creative commons \\"zero\\" licence in 2017 attracted criticism, as it took around 200,000 images out of the commons. The Unsplash licence is incompatible with creative commons licences, preventing use on sites like Wikipedia. In February 2018, Unsplash changed their license terms to restrict the sale of photos without first updating, modifying, or otherwise incorporating new creative elements into the photos, prohibiting selling unaltered copies, including selling the photos as prints or printed on physical goods. In December 2019, Unsplash for Brands was launched, where advertisers can share branded images on Unsplash.  History  Initially a pioneer of the copyright-free photography model, Unsplash was created in 2013 by Montreal-based entrepreneur Mikael Cho. While creating a new homepage for his company Crew, Cho was unable to find a suitable stock photo and hired a photographer instead. Afterwards, Cho posted the outtakes from his company photoshoot on Tumblr, inviting people to use them as they saw fit. Before June 2017, photos uploaded to Unsplash were made available under the Creative Commons zero license, which is a public domain equivalent license and a waiver, which allowed individuals to freely reuse, repurpose and remix photos for their own projects. This was changed in June 2017, and photos are now made available under the Unsplash copyright license, which imposes some additional restrictions. Unsplash received more than 50,000 visits on its first day. On 18 February 2018 Unsplash changed its license terms to restrict the sale of photos without first updating, modifying, or otherwise incorporating new creative elements into the photos, prohibiting selling unaltered copies, including selling the photos as prints or printed on physical goods. While Cho supplied the first batch of Unsplash photos, the site is now sustained by community contributions from amateur and professional photographers. Due to the volume of photo submissions, the site employs an editorial team and \\"curators\\" picked from the Unsplash community, including Guy Kawasaki, Nas, Khoi Vinh, Amanda Hesser and Om Malik. License controversies An example of a CC0 image added before the licence change. 200,000 other images can only be identified by hand. Unsplash photos are covered by the Unsplash license. The Unsplash license prevents users from using photos from Unsplash in a similar or competing service. While it gives downloaders the right to \\"copy, modify, distribute and use the photos for free, including commercial purposes, without asking permission from or providing attribution to the photographer or Unsplash\\" the Unsplash terms of service prohibit selling unaltered copies, including selling the photos as prints or printed on physical goods.https://unsplash.com/terms Before June 2017, Unsplash photos were covered by the Creative Commons zero license. Ryan Merkley asked for images released as CC0 to be made available as CC0Around 200,000 images were lost to the public domain. It was not possible to segregate or find which images had been available as CC0 prior to the licence change due to restrictions on the use of Unsplash's API. At the time of the licence change, Creative Commons Director Ryan Merkley asked that \\"[i]n order to ensure that the commons is maintained, we hope that Unsplash will either a) properly mark all the works shared using CC0 and/or b) make available a full archive of the CC0 works so they can be shared on a platform that supports open licensing\\". To date, Unsplash have declined to make these works reavailable or easily identifiable by machines. The Unsplash licence is incompatible with Creative Commons licences, meaning that content from Unsplash cannot be published under a creative commons licence without additional permissions from the original authors. Unsplash actively prevent authors from offering their content under creative commons licences, for instance by deleting references to such licenses from comments. The lack of attribution for Unsplash photos have been the subject of controversy among photography circles, due to some companies using free Unsplash photography for profit without compensating the photographers. Unsplash itself has stated that it does not support the practice. Book In 2016, while still a CC0 business, Unsplash released the Unsplash Book, the world's \\"first ever fully crowd-sourced\\" book. The book's photos, essays, and funding were all contributed by Unsplash's community. The book raised $106,000 on Kickstarter and included contributions from Harvard law professor and CC0 inventor Lawrence Lessig, and designer Tobias van Schneider. Unsplash API In addition to its website, Unsplash provides a public Application programming interface (API) that answers more than 3.8 billion photo requests per month. Some of the products using the Unsplash API include Medium, Trello, Squarespace, Codepen, Square as well as Unsplash own series of products such as Unsplash for iOS, Unsplash Instant, an extension for Google Chrome that loads Unsplash photos in new tabs and Unsplash for Apple TV. Unsplash Local Beyond its website and API, Unsplash has hosted photo walks in cities around the world including Tokyo, Montreal, Toronto and Boston. The photo walks are hosted by guides from the Unsplash community who show participants the best places to take photos in their city, how to use their cameras, and how to compose better photos.

A new division was formed along the Volga in December, and was soon sent north to join in the fighting around Demyansk until early 1943. In many respects the 55th was a hard-luck unit; after being destroyed once, it drew assignments to mostly secondary fronts in areas where, due to the terrain and other circumstances, no unit could distinguish itself. By early 1944, the division was reduced to minimal strength for an active formation, and after making some key gains in the pursuit phase of Operation Bagration it was transferred north to the Baltic States and then disbanded to provide replacements for the other units in 61st Army. Elements of the disbanded division were repurposed to other roles in coastal defense and as a naval base garrison, continuing in service until 1956.  1st Formation  A 55th Rifle Division was formed during the Russian Civil War at Petrograd in July, 1919,Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed Before June 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. VIII, Nafziger, 1996, p. 38 but it was dissolved after the war. The unit that eventually fought in World War II began forming as a territorial (reserve) division in the Moscow Military District in September, 1925. Its order of battle was as follows: * 163rd Rifle Regiment, based at Belgorod * 164th Rifle Regiment, based at Rylsk * 165th Rifle Regiment, divisional headquarters, and 55th Light Artillery Regiment, based at Kursk Due to its deployment, the division was known as the \\"Kursk\\" division from its beginning. At some point it also gained the distinction \\"in the name of K.Ye. Voroshilov\\". It was subordinated to the 10th Rifle Corps. In 1939 the division was part of the pre-war scrambling of the orders of battle of the Red Army,Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", p. 16 after which the OoB was as follows: * 107th Rifle Regiment * 111th Rifle Regiment * 228th Rifle Regiment * 84th Light Artillery Regiment * 141st Howitzer Regiment * 129th Antitank Battalion * Reconnaissance Battalion - with one company of BT-7 tanks.Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", p. 38 Following the Soviet invasion of Poland in September most of the division was assigned as the garrison of the Brest Fortress, while the remainder was stationed at Zhabinka. On February 21, 1940, Col. Dmitry Ivanovich Ivanyuk took command of the 55th. At the end of the year the division was relocated to Slutsk, and reassigned from 28th Rifle Corps to 47th Rifle Corps, where it remained in the reserves of Western Special Military District until the start of the German invasion. It was luckier than the divisions on the border, but was under orders to join 4th Army there in the event of war. In the event, the war came to the 55th, in the form of 2nd Panzer Group, within a week, chasing the remnants of the rest of 4th Army.Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", pp. 8, 38 Colonel Ivanyuk was killed in action on June 25, and succeeded by his deputy, Lt. Col. Gevork Andreevich Ter- Gasparyan, who was confirmed in command on July 14 and promoted to colonel. By July 5 the 55th was again in 28th Rifle Corps of 4th Army, with just 800 infantrymen left in the entire division. By the end of July it was under 13th Army which had been shoved off to the south on the right flank of the panzer group's drive across the Dniepr River. In late August the division was assigned to 21st Army in Central Front.Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", p. 38.Glantz states that the division was in Bryansk Front as of August 16; David M. Glantz, Barbarossa Derailed, Vol. 2, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2012, p. 564 Starting on August 19 the 55th took part in several actions against Guderian's panzers in the Unecha region. By the 27th the division was still attacking the flanks of the German penetration while the army's commander reported on the alarming progress the Germans had made to the south. By this time the 55th was in 66th Rifle Corps, along with the 75th, 232nd and 266th Rifle Divisions, described as the \\"strongest corps in [the] army\\", indicating that the division had received at least some replacements. By the 29th, 21st Army was looking for the means to orchestrate a breakout attack to the east, and 66th Corps was being ordered to hold the line north of Chernigov.Glantz, Barbarossa Derailed, Vol. 2, pp. 72, 120, 124, 369-71 In the end, the breakout was unsuccessful, and the division was effectively destroyed in the Kiev encirclement in September, although some men, such as Colonel Ter- Gasparyan, were able to escape. The division was officially dissolved on October 1.Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", p. 38 2nd Formation A new 55th Rifle Division began forming at Kuibyshev in the Volga Military District on December 12, 1941.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p. 20Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 101 Its order of battle remained similar to that of its previous formation. The rifle regiments and the antitank battalion retained the same numbers, the howitzer regiment was gone and the light artillery was now a standard artillery regiment, and in addition the following were under command: * 46th Sapper Battalion * 543rd Reconnaissance Company * 21st Signal Company * 35th Mortar Battalion (as of October, 1942) The division was under the command of Maj. Gen. Ivan Pavlovich Shevchuk. It remained in the Volga District until April, 1942, when it was briefly assigned to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, and then railed to the Northwestern Front. It remained in that Front until March, 1943, in either 11th or 27th Army, taking part in the grueling and dismal fighting around the Demyansk Pocket.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 20 General Shevchuk was not a success in his role as divisional commander. He had distinguished himself during the Russian Civil War in the Far East as commander of the 1st Tungussk Partisan Detachment, winning the Order of the Red Banner in 1928, and up to 1938 served as acting chief of the Construction Section of the Pacific Fleet. This was not adequate experience to lead a division in modern warfare and Shevchuk was out of his depth. As a result he was overly \\"coarse\\" in his dealings with his subordinates; as well, his unskillful leadership led to excessive casualties during the offensive fighting in May, 1942. In consequence, Shevchuk was brought before an 11th Army military tribunal. He was relieved of command of the division on May 10, being replaced by Col. Nikolai Nikolaievich Zaiulev, but due to his status as a Civil War hero he kept his rank and was appointed as deputy commander of the 241st Rifle Division. In the following months Shevchuk displayed excessive and ostentatious foolhardiness in combat situations, which seemed to indicate he was courting death to atone for his disgrace. If so, he got his wish on October 28, when he embarked on a mounted reconnaissance of the division's frontage. His horse stepped on a German landmine, which killed the horse and blew off both of his legs; he died a few hours later and was buried the next day with full military honors.Aleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, trans. and ed. David M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishers, London, UK, 1998, pp. 68-69, 212-13 Colonel Zaiulev remained in command of the 55th until January 21, 1944. In November, concurrent with Operation Uranus and Operation Mars, Northwestern Front launched yet another offensive against the Demyansk Pocket. The 55th was in reserve of 11th Army and was not involved in the initial attacks, which were unsuccessful, but was ordered forward in December to renew the offensive. This also failed, and the pocket was not taken until the German forces evacuated in March, 1943.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, pp. 100, 104 Following this, the division went into the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and then to 53rd Army east of Kursk in April. When the Battle of Kursk began in July, the 55th was a separate division in 60th Army of Central Front, on the western face of the salient, and therefore saw little action. When the German offensive ended the division was temporarily transferred to 70th Army, and then in August, when the Soviet summer offensive began, it was assigned to 61st Army, where it would remain until it was disbanded. At this time it was also assigned to 29th Rifle Corps.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 20  Into Belarus and Disbandment  For most of the rest of its existence, the 55th was involved in the battles to liberate Belarus (Belorussia). In October, Central Front was renamed Belorussian Front. Prior to this, by September 30, the division had captured a small bridgehead across the Dniepr between Loev and Radul. This bridgehead became the main staging area for the offensive that liberated Gomel in late November, although it involved regrouping the 55th into another bridgehead to the south. Prior to the Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive Operation in early November the division was reassigned to the 89th Rifle Corps, where it would remain until disbanded. The 55th deployed in the Kuchaevka-Domamerki sector in the first echelon alongside 15th Rifle Division. During the offensive, on November 28, the corps, supported by 2nd Guards Cavalry Corps, drove a wedge into German defenses on the approaches to Iurevichi on the Pripiat River but was unable to exploit further. A further offensive to try to liberate the German stronghold at Kalinkovichi began on December 8, with 89th Corps on the left flank of 61st Army's front. By this time both sides were exhausted, and although a few gains were made, the offensive was shut down on December 12.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 99, 103, 106-07, 181, 197, 246-47 On January 8, 1944, 61st and 65th Armies, the left wing of Belorussian Front, launched the Kalinkovichi-Mozyr Offensive, with the objective of liberating these two fortified towns and drive the German forces back at least to the Ipa River. Prior to the offensive the 2nd and 7th Guards Cavalry Corps were regrouped from east to south of Kalinkovichi, screened by 415th Rifle Division that was facing a scratch force of three German battle groups. When the offensive opened, the cavalry soon deeply outflanked the German forces in the western sector, but the main attacks of the two Soviet armies made little progress. In spite of this, the German grouping was in a very deep pocket, and after several days of fighting through very difficult terrain, the 55th, advancing westwards along the rail line south of Klinsk, linked up with the cavalry.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 419, 426, 433, 451 On January 14 the division was recognized for this with the following honorific: Col. Kornei Mikhailovich Andrusenko was given command of the division on January 22, and he would remain at that post for the duration of the 2nd formation.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=4530, Retrieved 17/01/17 By March, the 55th was severely worn down by this grim fighting in the Pripiat swamps and forests. Its rifle regiments had no rifle battalion structure left; each regiment consisted of four separate rifle companies, each of 90 men in three platoons and a section each of sub-machine gunners and heavy machine guns. Each regiment also had a single mortar and a single heavy machine gun company, plus a reconnaissance platoon. In short, the front line strength of the division was about half that of one full-strength rifle regiment.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 20 At the start of Operation Bagration the division was still in the much-reduced 61st Army, in the western sector of the re-named 1st Belorussian Front, facing German 2nd Army along the south face of the Pripiat region. It played a limited role in the actual offensive, mostly holding the line and acting as a follow-on force as the Germans retreated.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 209-10 Before dawn on June 29 the Dniepr Flotilla's 2nd Brigade of river cutters landed forces of the 55th across the Pripyat River in the areas of Krukovichi and Belki, and in the Petrilov area a day later. Overcoming the enemy's resistance by the end of July 4 the division had taken the important railroad junction of Starushki and the town of Koptsevichi.Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrision, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, Kindle ed., vol. 2, pt. 1, ch. 5 As a result of this action, specifically its role in the liberation of Luninets, the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for \\"exemplary fulfillment of command tasks\\" and its \\"valor and courage\\" on July 23. It then went into the Reserve of the Supreme High Command in late July, along with the rest of its army, through August and September,Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 20 moving north to join 3rd Baltic Front in the vicinity of Riga. In late 1944 the Red Army was facing a manpower \\"crunch\\" as most men available were going into the new artillery and other support units rather than the rifle divisions. In consequence of this, on October 7 the division was broken up in 61st Army to provide replacements for the other units in the army.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 20 At the time of its disbandment, the division carried the official title of 55th Rifle, Mozyr, Order of the Red Banner Division. (Russian: 55-—è —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∫–æ–≤–∞—è –ú–æ–∑—ã—Ä—å—Å–∫–∞—è –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–∑–Ω–∞–º—ë–Ω–Ω–∞—è –¥–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—è.)  Descendant formations  On November 1, 1944, the headquarters and other assets of the division were converted into the 1st Mozyr Red Banner Naval Infantry Division of the Baltic Fleet at Oranienbaum. Its subordinate units were renumbered. The 107th Rifle Regiment became the 1st Regiment, the 111th Rifle Regiment became the 2nd Regiment, and the 228th became the 3rd Regiment. The 185th Tank Regiment became the 1st Tank Regiment and the 84th Artillery became the 1st Artillery. The division formed the garrison of the Porkkala Naval Base, which had been leased by Finland after the end of the Continuation War in September. In 1948, the division became the 1st Machine Gun Artillery Division of the Baltic Fleet. The 1st Regiment became the 51st Machine Gun Artillery Regiment, the 2nd Regiment the 54th, and the 3rd Regiment the 57th. The 1st Tank Regiment was renumbered as the 194th and the 1st Artillery was renumbered as the 414th. The 53rd and 60th Machine Gun Artillery Regiments were added to the division after being formed from ground units. The division included 16,000 soldiers, occupying 280 machine gun and 208 artillery bunkers. In 1955, negotiations for a Soviet withdrawal began, and the division began disbanding in August 1955. The process was completed in January 1956, when what remained of the division was disbanded at the Bobochinsky Camp in the Leningrad Military District. In December 1967, the honors and awards of the 1st Machine Gun Artillery Division were bestowed upon the newly forming 55th Naval Infantry Division of the Soviet Pacific Fleet.

It was constructed and established, when Reverend William Pettigrew baptized and converted twelve Tangkhul Naga to Protestant Christian Baptist faith in 1901. History \\"Phungyo\\", a term derived from \\"Beautiful Hill\\" was given by Reverend William Pettigrew, when Hungphun (Ukhrul headquarter) elders told Pettigrew that a beautiful mount or hill is known as Phungyo in Tangkhul-Naga dialect. The Church, Phungyo Baptist Church, is constructed on this hill; hence, the name. The first Christian Church in Manipur, the church trace its origin to 29 September 1901, when 12 Tangkhul men were converted to Christianity by Pettigrew. The birth of Christianity among the Tangkhuls is therefore associated with this conversion. Baptized at Ngayira Rakhong (Ngayira Spring Pong), the first converts include, Hollei Rumthao, Sangmayang Kashung, Ramkaiphang Samrar, Leishisan Shaiza, Maninglum Kashung, Mangaleng Shaiza, Sakhayang Awungashi Shimray, Shangam Kasar, Kaphungkui Chiphang, Haora Mahongnao, Mashokring Kasomhung, and Thiksha Shokchui Kapai. Women later followed the step, and ten of them converted to Christianity in 1910. Baptized by Pettigrew, they include, Sanamla Ragui, Mahongai Rumthao, Horngaila/ Harngaila Singnaisui, Lanotla Samrar, Charoni Ngakang, Ngalew Ngakang, Kasuni Ngakang, Shareila Muirung, Lasengla Kasomwoshi, and Mikngaola Shingnaisui. The first Phungyo Church that the converts attended were made of mud walls, and having left in ruins by Allied air raid in search of Japanese forces during the second World War, the present (standing) church was reconstructed, and inaugurated by Kanrei Shaiza on 7 February 1977. Spiritual Activities of Phungyo Baptist Church Conversion to Christianity disallowed many of the customs and culture followed by the Tangkhuls as part of their traditions. According to Shaiza, these include \\"maintenance of mohawk hairstyle (Hao Kuiret), brewing and drinking rice beer (Khor), attending traditional- educational schools (Longshim), and participating in the death ritual ceremony (Kathi Kasham)\\", making the Tangkhuls to forego these customs and culture. The Western Missionaries disallowing such customs and traditions made Phungyo Baptist Church to grow along the lines of Western-Christian norms. Spiritual growth was further received in 1923, when the Church experienced the outbreak and spread of revivalism through the work of Ruichumhao Rungsung, Ninghei Luikham, Miksha Kashung Shimray and Thisan Luikham. This spiritual growth was met with severe challenges, when L.L. Peters, the then SDO of Ukhrul District (1924) issued \\"Orders to stem out Christian religion in Ukhrul District\\". Some Christian Pioneers like Thisan Luikham and Amayar A. Shishak suffered severely under these orders. However, such orders only made the Tangkhuls to become stronger in faith, and multiply. The spread in faith culminated towards establishing Phungyo Christian Endeavour or CE (for Youth) by on 7 July 1910; and the Women Society of Phungyo Baptist Church on 31 August 1917. The Phungyo CE was renamed as Phungyo Baptist Youth Society in 1983. Recent Developments Phungyo Baptist Church Members, 2016 Although singspiration formed one of the most important form of worshiping among the Christian Tangkhuls, there was no organized Church Choir before 1952 at Phungyo Baptist Church. The CE later took the initiative of organizing a Church Choir, marking the birth with celebration at Pakahao Samrar's place (Alungtang Colony), on the second Sunday of March, 1953. Marking this Sunday as the 'Choir Raising Day', the second Sunday of March is observed as the birth day of the Church choir every year. The Church hosted the Tangkhul Baptist Long (TBL) Centenary from 7 March to 10 March 1996, to celebrate one hundred years of the Tangkhuls becoming Christians. The Phungyo Church centenary in the meantime was celebrated from 27 ‚Äì 29 September 2002. Owing to the strong faith and the efforts of the Church, Tangkhuls have the Holy Bible and Christian Hymnals in their own dialect. The Holy Bible was published in the Tangkhul dialect by the Bible Society of India, and although it still requires revision on a wide scale, it serves as the basic and most vital book of the Tangkhuls and of the Church.

History The group was formed in A Coru√±a although the members are from different parts of Barbanza, and A Coru√±a. They take their name from the song Bizarre Love Triangle by the British band New Order. Before recording their first album, Tri√°ngulo de Amor Bizarro recorded two self-produced demos that reached the semifinals of the demo competition DEMO Project of the Festival Internacional de Benic√†ssim two consecutive years in 2004 and 2005. In their beginnings the band was a quartet, deriving over time into a quintet before the recording of their first album, in which they form as a trio, until the entrance of Oscar Vilari√±o and Rafael Mallo, and with the departure of Juli√°n Ulpiano (drums) in 2009. Once signed for the label Mushroom Pillow, they recorded their debut self-titled album, Tri√°ngulo de Amor Bizarro in 2007, with technical Carlos Hernandez, known for the producing independent music albums independent of well-known bands like Los Planetas Sr. Chinarro and Mercromina . The album received very good reviews from the press, appearing at the top among Spanish albums 2007 (ranked 2nd in the journal Mondosonoro and 9th in Rockdelux). In addition it was also picked among the best of the decade's most influential music media, as Rockdelux, Mondosonoro, Jenesaispop and others. That same year they also release El Hombre del Siglo V, a compilation album of their two early demos which also includes three new songs. At the end of 2009 they begin to record their second album entitled A√±o Santo produced by Paco Loco and is released in May 2010. De la Monarqu√≠a a la Criptocracia is released as a single accompanied by a video directed by Luis Cervero. A√±o Santo receives positive critical acclaim from both the press and public, and is celebrated as one of the best so far the year. They tour the album in Mexico and play the festivals of the peninsula, like el FIB, Paredes de Coura, and de M√©xico, where they participate in Corona Capital. The promotional tour is extended to 2011. In 2011 Rub√©n Mu√±oz, also known as Zippo, enters the band and Oscar Vilari√±o leaves. They win the IMAS prize in Mexico for best Spanish band. A√±o Santo is nominated to 9 categories in independent music awards (UFI) and are awarded with four of them, including Album of the Year. In 2012 they recorded the digital single Ellas Se Burlaron de Mi Magia at the Red Bull Studios in Madrid, produced by Peter Kember (Sonic Boom) and mixed by Roberto Mallo. Later that year they began recording their third studio album, Victoria M√≠stica. The album is released in July 2013, produced by the band itself, recorded in their own studio by Roberto Mallo, mixing by Manny Nieto (Breeders, Health, The Wolves) and mastering by Shane Smith. In 2016 they released Salve Discordia recorded by Carlos Hern√°ndez Nombela.

They then established themselves as building contractors in Collingwood. They were joined by their mother Sarah and younger brothers Thomas, Robert and David in 1854. The older brothers moved to Dean near Creswick and embarked on a successful timber milling enterprise in the Bullarook Forest with sawmills at Dean, Barkstead and Adekate Creek.Ballarat and District Industrial Heritage Project, Federation University John Anderson was prominent in the establishment in February 1861 of the ‚ÄúFarmers Joint Stock Flour Mill‚Äù by Smeaton farmers. Plans to build a mill fell through, but the Andersons determined that they would build their own flour and oat mill in June 1861. The five-story bluestone mill was completed and opened on 29 April 1862, with the oat milling section being completed by the following harvest season. The water wheel follows designs developed by John Smeaton, incorporating wrought iron spokes and cast iron hub and gears. The foundry patterns remained on site, with the original components having been cast by Hunt and Opie's Victoria Foundry in Ballarat.Water wheel casting stolen from Anderson's Mill in Smeaton Julie Atkins the Advocate, 1 Apr 2014 The water supply for the water wheel comes from Hepburn Lagoon, located about from the mill, and delivered via Birch Creek and a water race, with the last section in an wrought iron trough elevated on timber trestles.Smeaton Independent News, Smeaton Mill It is likely that John Anderson was responsible for the design of the mill, and the drafting of the drawings in the Latrobe Library, as he had been apprenticed in Scotland to a millwright. In April 1862 the Creswick Advertiser announced: the building is full of flour and wheat and the whole although only recently completed presents already a very business like and busy appearance. The large water wheel constructed at a cost of ¬£1 500 works well‚Äù.Creswick Advertiser April 1862 And shortly after that the brothers intended: ...to shortly erect machinery for the manufacture of oatmeal making an addition to their extensive mill by erecting a building 40 foot by 35 foot. In addition to the main mill John Anderson erected a bluestone oat drying kiln and also built a nine room house and a workshop. Other buildings included a detached timber grain store built in the later 1860s behind the mill, a bluestone manager‚Äôs office in front of the mill in 1869 and two timber stables in 1870s. Refitting as roller mill David Anderson was responsible for the refit of the mill as a roller mill, using the latest equipment in 1896 and had relative success until his death in 1929. His widow then continued the operation, mainly producing oat products, pearl barley and split peas. Flour milling became a minor component after World War Two, along with a brief stint of ricena production, a rice substitute involving polished wheat. However, David Anderson and Co ceased business in 1959 and the mill finally closed with most the machinery being sold for scrap, or to local farmers for grain cleaning. Closure and government acquisition After closure the mill remained dormant for many years, but a report in 1979 advised that the site should be purchased by the Victorian Government due to its historical significance. Funding was obtained under the Bicentennial Authority and the State Government, with the mill acquired from the owners, Lyn Anderson and Shirley Meulan, in 1987 by the Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands. The site has been managed by Parks Victoria since 1996.

It may be self- administered. Description The 24-hour diet recall relies on a trained interviewer, an accurate memory of intake, an ability to estimate portion size, and the interviewee's reliability to not misreport. This method can be administered by telephone, is suitable for large surveys, and has a low burden for respondents. In the interview, participants are asked to describe the foods and drinks they have consumed in the previous 24 hours; the participant then might be asked to provide more detail than what was initially provided. The open-ended nature of the interview is intended to help produce the most detailed description of foods and drinks consumed over the previous 24 hours. Details might include time of day, source of food, and portion size of food. A 24-hour diet recall is typically completed in 20‚Äì60 minutes. The 24-hour diet recall is most accurate when administered more than once for each individual. 24-hour diet recall is more interactive than other techniques and so provides a way for the interviewer and interviewee to interact during the recall. The interviewer may use various props, such as a deck of cards, to indicate a weight amount for the foods and drinks consumed; however, the props might not be appropriate in cross-cultural settings. The interviewer might also use different techniques to jog memory including working chronologically, or asking the interviewee to recall all of their activities during the previous day, or asking other probing questions in an effort to make sure the interviewee remembers as much as possible. The interviewer might ask the respondent to remember eating and drinking by time period or linking them to day time activities. Data Data from a 24-hour diet recall can include: * The total amount consumed of each specific food and beverage * The total amount consumed of each group of similar foods or beverages * The nutrient intake from food and beverage * Meal and snack patterns, consumption of food either home or away from home, and other contextual information * A population's mean usual intake * A group's usual dietary intake distributions * Relationships between diet and health, or other variables * The effectiveness of an intervention study to change diet Uses 24-hour diet recalls are used by medical professionals, nutrition specialists, and social scientists. Nutritional information for these recalls are best analysed using computer-based nutritional assessment programs. A 2013 study determined that the 24-hour multiple-pass recall is a sufficient method for assessing dietary intake of toddlers of Iraqi or Somali born mothers in Norway. Correlation between 24-hour diet recalls and food frequency questionnaires has been estimated to be 0.60‚Äì0.70. Additionally, 24-hour diet recalls measure intake with less bias than food frequency questionnaires. Limitations Since the results of a 24-hour diet recall are not representative, it is not a good stand-alone method and should be utilized with other methods, such as food frequency questionnaires. A 24-hour diet recall cannot account for day-to-day variation, and so should be administered multiple times to be useful. The method has also been criticized due to the administrator and participant variation that it can cause. As the recall is memory dependent, there may also be bias in respondents over or under reporting good/bad foods, or poorly estimating portion sizes. The 24-hour diet recall is affected by reactivity. The 24-hour diet recall is a poor method for measuring intake for food or drink with a high day-to-day variability. The 24-hour diet recall is unsuitable for large scale studies due to its time, literacy, and economic constraints. 24-hour diet recalls are used less frequently in pregnant women.

She made national headlines again when she reportedly married a prince in 1913 and a count in 1919.  Biography  Fern Krehbiel (sometimes spelled Kraybill) was born near Winfield, Kansas, on December 19, 1888, the daughter of Reuben and Luella (Roberts) Krehbiel. Her mother, Luella Krehbiel, was a Socialist Party organizer who traveled the country giving speeches. Fern grew up in Winfield and Coffeyville. When she was sixteen, she moved with her mother to Kansas City, where she attended a drama school and acted with the Woodward Stock Company in Omaha and Kansas City.  Broadway career In the fall of 1907, she moved to New York and obtained a part in the Clyde Fitch vaudeville comedy, Miss McCobb, Manicuriste. It was there that she was \\"discovered\\" by Fitch, who was reportedly so taken with her performance that he wrote a character into his next play, Girls, especially for her. She made her Broadway debut in Girls the following year, and immediately became \\"one of the most popular ing√©nue actresses that ever stepped upon a Broadway stage.\\" Maycliffe starred opposite Charles Cherry in Fitch's The Bachelor in 1909, and Edward Peple's The Spitfire in 1910. In 1912 she starred in George M. Cohan's Officer 666, which was later made into a silent film. Soon afterwards she married and retired from acting, returning to the stage one last time in 1917 to star in Saturday to Monday, a satire of the women's suffrage movement. A reviewer in Life magazine wrote at the time, \\"After a considerable absence from the New York stage Miss Ruth Maycliffe returns to display an unexpected versatility of a young person considerably more attractive than those usual to Suffrage ranks, who is strong in her convictions and actions at first, but later shows herself a womanly woman of the right sort.\\"  Personal life  Newspapers and magazines printed many conflicting and sensational stories about Maycliffe. When the Washington Post described her as an accomplished horsewoman who could rope a steer in record time, President Theodore Roosevelt was reportedly so impressed that he summoned her to the White House for a meeting. In 1914 she made national headlines when she disembarked from an ocean liner, the Laconia, claiming that she had married a Portuguese nobleman and was now the Princess Braganza d'Avellar. Some sources reported that she had grown up on a cattle ranch in Mexico, claims which were refuted by her hometown newspaper. According to one widely circulated news story, Maycliffe had been married only a short time when the prince was killed in a revolutionary battle in Portugal, leaving her a widow. In 1919 she met Georges Benetau du Buat (1894-1973), a French officer who was doing engineering work at Fort Dix, and married him. It was only when she accompanied him to France to meet his family, and was greeted as the \\"Countess du Buat\\", that she learned he was a count. The couple moved to Paris in 1920, then to a village in Brittany in 1937. After World War II they returned to the United States, where her husband worked as an electrical engineer for the Pacific Gas and Electric Company. They moved to Italy in 1969. Her husband died in 1973 and is buried in Bordighera. Maycliffe, then known as the Countess Fern du Buat, died in San Francisco on November 9, 1981. She is buried in the Union Cemetery in Winfield.

It was described by Thomas Broun in 1893 after being discovered in the Mokohinau Islands by Andreas Stewart Sandager, a lighthouse keeper on the islands. The species survives only on the small unnamed island \\"Stack H\\", in an patch of vegetation the size of a living room, and is in extreme danger of extinction. Description Pinned specimen Including their large mandibles (used for fighting over mates), male specimens range in length from 25.5 to 32.8 mm and are 10.4‚Äì12.4 mm wide. Females range in length from 20.0‚Äì22.5 mm. Their exoskeleton is black and ranges from dull to moderately glossy. The thorax is back, glossy, and wider than it is long. The elytra are rounded at the posterior, almost equally long and wide, and covered in short branching hairs. Male beetles have three teeth at the apex of the mandibles; females have two. What distinguishes this species from all other New Zealand stag beetles is a long conical vertical tooth, on the top of the mandible, in both sexes. Distribution This species is only known from the Mokohinau Islands in New Zealand. It was one of 130 beetle species collected on the Mokohinaus by lighthouse keeper Andreas Stewart Sandager (stationed on Burgess Island 1883‚Äì1889); a third of these species turned out to be new to science, and were described by Thomas Broun.Andreas Fleming Stewart Sandager's name takes various forms in the literature ‚Äì Andreas Fremming Stewart Sandager, F. S. Sandager, F. Sandager, P. Sandager, and even P. Stewart-Sandager ‚Äì sometimes appearing two different ways in the same publication. Sandager's wrasse (Coris sandeyeri) takes its species name from another variant of his surname, Sandeyer. The stag beetle's type locality was given by Broun as \\"Halodroma Islet\\", but there is no island by that name. \\"Halodroma\\" may be another name for Lizard Island, a small flat island southeast of Burgess Island; Halodroma urinatrix is the former name of Pelacanoides urinatrix, the diving petrel, which used to nest in burrows on Lizard and two other low Mokohinau islands. A few more specimens were collected in 1902, and then none until the species was rediscovered in 1984 on \\"Stack H\\", a 1.2 ha island southwest of Burgess Island. All recent surveys have only found this species on Stack H, in a \\"living-room sized\\" patch of New Zealand ice plant or horokaka (Disphyma australe); it has not been seen on Lizard Island since its description in 1893. Habitat Geodorcus species on mainland New Zealand are associated with rotten logs, but these are absent from Stack H. The Mokohinau Islands are generally very arid, with poor moisture retention. This beetle burrows into a peat-like layer of soil formed by New Zealand ice plant (Disphyma australe). It has also been found under rocks, in the tussock grass Chionochloa bromoides, and in the leaf litter beneath coastal pohutukawa. Diet These beetles are nocturnal, and their feeding behaviour is unknown. Adult stag beetles worldwide have mouthparts suited to feeding on liquids. Geodorcus helmsi has been seen feeding on sappy exudations on tree trunks. Rotting wood, tree roots or humus are the most common food sources for stag beetle larvae, and G. ithaginis lives in an environment of enriched humus. Conservation Searches specifically for G. ithaginis from 1991 to 1994 in the Mokohinau group of islands only found three live beetles on Stack H; nine beetles is the maximum simultaneously observed in recent times. The Mokohinau Islands have been heavily modified by land clearance, burning, grazing, and introduction of the kiore or Polynesian rat; Lizard Island was briefly colonised by kiore in the late 1970s. Rats were eradicated from all the Mokohinau Islands in the 1990s, but subsequent surveys for G. ithaginis on Lizard Island have been unsuccessful. Fire, storms, and rodent introductions are thought to be the most serious threats to this species' survival. Climate change, resulting in a drying out of the island habitat, may also be a threat. The conservation status of this species is categorised as 'nationally critical'. Like other Geodorcus species, this large, slow-moving beetle is protected from collectors under schedule 7 of the 1953 Wildlife Act. Captive breeding and reintroduction to rat-free islands such as Lizard Island was the Department of Conservation plan for ensuring this species' survival. A expedition in January 2019 thoroughly searched the beetle's habitat on Stack H, another nearby stack, and Lizard Island, and found nothing but fragments of exoskeleton of indeterminate age, and concluded G. ithaginis may possibly be extinct.

It features short essays by Doris Lessing, Colin Wilson, John Osborne, John Wain, Kenneth Tynan, Bill Hopkins, Lindsay Anderson and Stuart Holroyd.

An American edition was published in 1958 by E. P. Dutton. A sequel, Conviction, this time edited by Norman MacKenzie, was published by MacGibbon & Kee in 1958. Reception Virginia P. Held of The Reporter described the book as \\"chiefly valuable as an expression of a generation\\", which she called \\"an up-from-zero generation\\". Held elaborated: > The critics have almost exclusively stressed the nihilism of these 'angry > young men,' often using the label in an attempt to ridicule them, and in > doing so have missed the point. It isn't their nihilism that distinguishes > these writers, but their unwillingness to remain nihilists. The zero is > where they start, not where they end up; they know they must move up from it > somehow. Leslie A. Fiedler wrote in the Saturday Review that the writers were introduced as \\"brilliant and iconoclastic\\" on the jacket of the book, but thought that none of them \\"strikes one as really 'brilliant' (Tynan is funny enough by fits and starts and Osborne vigorously direct, but the rest are merely earnest and opaque), while their 'iconoclasm' consists of nothing more shocking than complaints against bureaucracy, the monarchy, and H-bomb tests, eked out with attacks on each other.\\" Concerning the \\"angry young men\\" label, Fiedler went on to question Lessing's youth, the source of Osborne's anger, and all the writers' decision to contribute to the anthology; Kingsley Amis had been asked to participate but declined, which Fiedler commended. Fiedler continued: > Despite Mr. Osborne's protest that he is not the protagonist of Look Back in > Anger and the desperate plea of all the accused that they are not Amis's > Lucky Jim, it is evident that they write the same dialogue for themselves as > for their characters. For such angry-young-dialogue one is finally grateful; > it is what makes Mr. Osborne's piece, along with Mr. Tynan's, a hiatus of > brightness in a dim, dim book. But even the Angries, when they leave their > lovely scorn and speak affirmatively, sound like all the other contributors, > merge into the general middlebrow revolt against shrillness and despair.

Bob Bossin (born 1946) is a Canadian folk singer, writer and activist who co-founded the Canadian folk group Stringband with Marie-Lynn Hammond. Bossin is the writer of the songs \\"Dief Will Be the Chief Again\\", \\"Show Us the Length\\", \\"Tugboats\\", \\"The Maple Leaf Dog\\" and \\"Sulphur Passage (No pasaran)\\". As well, Bossin wrote and performed two solo musicals, Bossin's Home Remedy for Nuclear War and Davy the Punk. The latter is based on the book Davy the Punk (The Porcupine's Quill, 2014), Bossin's memoir of his outlaw father.  Early life  Bob Bossin grew up in Toronto surrounded by artists, entertainers and writers. His mother, Marcia Bossin (n√©e Marcella Louise Levitt, 1912‚Äì2006) was a painter. His father, David Bossin (1905‚Äì1963), was a booking agent for nightclubs. Two of Bob's uncles were writers. Hye Bossin was a columnist and editor, and Art Arthur (n√© Bossin) was a screenwriter. Arthur wrote the 1946 Academy-Award- winning documentary, Seeds of Destiny. As a boy, Bossin fell in love with the early rock 'n rollers ‚Äì Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Gene Vincent ‚Äì but by 1958 he had turned his ear to folk music. The variety, earthiness and politics of folk songs so captivated Bossin that the genre became his musical home for the next half century. Bossin graduated from the University of Toronto in 1968. His university years coincided with the zenith of student and youth activism in Canada: the civil rights movement, opposition to the war in Vietnam, anti- nuclear and disarmament campaigns, and the nascent environment and feminist movements all engaged young people, Bossin among them. He became, and remained, a lifelong activist and social critic. Those same years saw a revamping of CBC Radio by young, engaged journalists recruited from the student press, among them Doug Ward, Volkmar Richter, Mark Starowitz, and Peter Gzowski. When Gzowski became editor of Maclean's Magazine in 1971, he assigned 25-year-old Bossin a regular column. Bossin would continue to write essays and articles, and produce radio documentaries, for many years. But his main focus was music.  Stringband 1971‚Äì1986  A detailed history of Stringband can be found through the links section below. In 1971 Bossin met Marie-Lynn Hammond, a young, bilingual singer and songwriter. He recruited Jerry Lewycky, a violin student at University of Toronto's Faculty of Music, to accompany them on fiddle. The configuration ‚Äì guitar, banjo, fiddle and voices ‚Äì was that of a string band, one of the traditional North American folk music forms. Stringband's first album, on their own Nick Records label, was released in 1973. The timing was propitious: the early 1970s saw a burgeoning of Canadian culture. Young writers like Margaret Atwood and Michael Ondaatje were being published. Cultural institutions like Theatre Passe Muraille, the House of Anansi Press, Attic Records and CBC Radio's This Country in the Morning/ Morningside began. Stringband, with its repertoire of Canadian songs and stories, provided a sound track for this cultural revolution. \\"They search relentlessly for a Canadian sound,\\" Canadian poet Doug Fetherling wrote of Stringband in Saturday Night Magazine in 1975. \\"Not hearing it, they have perhaps invented it.\\" In 1974 Lewycky left the group and was replaced by fiddler Ben Mink, who would become one of Canada's most respected musicians and music producers. Mink left Stringband in 1976 and jazz violinist Terry King took over on fiddle. King was followed by Zeke Mazurek in 1978 and Calvin Cairns in 1983. Bassist Dennis Nichol joined the group in 1979. Other musicians who played or recorded with Stringband include Frank Barth, Doug Bowes, Jane Fair, Daniel Lanois, Kieran Overs, Stan Rogers, Alan Soberman, Chris Whitely and, for a time replacing Marie-Lynn Hammond, singer-songwriter Nanci Ahern. Stringband recorded nine albums, toured Canada for 15 years, and performed in the U.S., the U.K, the U.S.S.R, France, Mexico and Japan. They gained a loyal, almost fanatical, following. The group disbanded in 1986, but in 2001, former fans donated $25,000 to fund The Indispensable Stringband, a retrospective CD-box set released in 2002. Historian of Canadian folk music, Gary Cristall, summed up Stringband's influence: > As they toured, they picked up regional images, stories and songs‚Ä¶. They had > a repertoire that combined modernity and tradition, both official languages, > family and history, politics and sex, geography and poetry, work and play. > For Canadian musicians, Stringband's most significant influence came not > from their music, but from how they purveyed it. Bob‚Ä¶ realized that if you > sold your own records, you made a lot more money than if a record company > sold them. Others soon realized it too, partly as a result of watching > Stringband. Bob perfected things that are now standard in independent music > far beyond folk circles. > ‚Ä¶Stringband's core audience was the broad political and cultural left, the > folks who built the anti-war movements, the environmental movement, and the > women's movement‚Ä¶ Stringband played their benefits and articulated their > vision of the world. The band, and Bob and Marie-Lynn as individual artists, > have never broken faith with these people or their beliefs.  Songs and solo recordings  Stringband recorded many Bossin songs. Among the most popular were \\"Daddy Was a Ballplayer\\" (1972), \\"Dief Will Be the Chief Again\\" (1974), \\"Lunenberg Concerto\\" (1974), \\"Show Us the Length\\" (1974), \\"Tugboats\\" (1977), \\"The Casca and the Whitehorse Burned Down\\" (1978), and \\"Newfoundlanders\\" (1978). Other singers, including Pete Seeger, Peggy Seeger, Ian Tyson and Valdy covered Bossin's songs. Despite little air play because of its explicit language, \\"Show Us the Length\\" became a favourite folk song among feminists and was performed by both professional and amateur singers as far away from Canada as New Zealand and Japan. In the U.S., Pete Seeger sang the song for years. After Stringband disbanded in 1986, Bossin released several solo albums including Gabriola V0R1X0 (1994) and The Roses on Annie's Table (2005), the latter produced by Vancouver art-rock diva, Veda Hille. Bossin's songs included \\"The Secret of Life According to Satchel Paige\\" (1982), \\"Sulphur Passage (No pasaran)\\" (1989), \\"Ya Wanna Marry Me?\\" (1991), \\"Bill Miner\\" (1993) \\"Nanaimo\\" (2001), and \\"The Roses on Annie's Table\\" (2005). \\"Bossin's songs were humane, evocative and literate,\\" Gary Cristall writes in Some played harder... \\"He would give each song its own singer: an old camp cook reminiscing about the Wobbly who tried to organize cowboys; a tugboat man who, after 35 years on the Strait of Georgia, knew to 'wait and let it come to you.' Bob created Newfoundlanders who were not Canadian by a damn sight; Yukoners who brought lawn chairs and thermoses while the Casca and the Whitehorse burned down; and the guy from Saskatchewan hopefully awaiting the second coming of John Diefenbaker. Bob welded together sentiment, history and landscape as few songwriters have done.\\"  Sulphur Passage and Clayoquot  From the late 1970s to the late 1990s, the fate of the wilderness of Vancouver Island's Clayoquot Sound was one of Canada's most hard-fought environmental causes. Bossin was involved from the beginning. He wrote songs and articles and produced radio documentaries, including \\"What Happened at Clayoquot\\" for CBC Radio's flagship Ideas program. One song, Sulphur Passage (No pasaran) was made into a music video by documentary director, Nettie Wild. Sung by a Who's Who of British Columbia folk artists ‚Äì Bossin, Stephen Fearing, Roy Forbes, Veda Hille, Ann Mortifee, Raffi, Rick Scott, Valdy and Jennifer West ‚Äì Sulphur Passage won a half-dozen awards. The video can be seen through the links section below. Sulphur Passage became the anthem of the Clayoquot protesters and played a significant role in the preservation of the Clayoquot forest. Bottle of Bossin's Home Remedy for Nuclear War  Bossin's Home Remedy for Nuclear War  In the 1980s, the advent of a new generation of nuclear weapons ‚Äì Pershing, Trident and Cruise missiles ‚Äì re-aroused the nuclear disarmament movement that had begun in the late 1940s. In Vancouver BC, tens of thousands marched in an annual Walk for Peace. The Vancouver East Cultural Centre commissioned Bossin to write a peace-themed show to coincide with the 1986 march. Bossin believed that the arms race would only be stopped by the activism of ordinary citizens, a \\"home remedy\\", so he created a musical medicine show, Bossin's Home Remedy for Nuclear War. The show was first directed by Jackie Crosland, and then, in subsequent stagings, by Colin Thomas, Peter Froehlich and Simon Webb. Home Remedy toured Canada, the U.S., New Zealand and Australia, selling over 9000 bottles of \\"Dr. Bossin's\\" potion.  Davy the Punk  In the 1930s Dave Bossin, Bob's father, was a notable figure in Toronto's gambling underworld. Intrigued by his father's history, Bob collected stories about \\"Davy the Punk\\" (Dave Bossin's underworld nickname) and the race-track milieu he inhabited. In 2014, The Porcupine's Quill published Davy the Punk: A Story of Bookies, Toronto the Good, the Mob and my Dad to glowing reviews. Subsequently, the book won the Pinsky-Givon prize for non-fiction and was short-listed for the Vine Prize. It also received a citation from Heritage Toronto. Bossin then based a one-person musical, also called Davy the Punk, on the book. The show toured Canada for several years. A film version is planned. Only one bear in a hundred bites but they don't come in order In 2017 Bossin released Only one bear in a hundred bites but they don't come in order, a video on the danger of a catastrophic fire at the terminus of the controversial Kinder Morgan pipeline. The proposed pipeline would carry tar-sands oil from Northern Alberta to the Port of Vancouver. The project faced vehement opposition by coastal citizens and First Nations. This opposition contributed to the defeat of the British Columbia Provincial Government in 2017. Released during the election campaign, Only one bear... received 13,000 views on YouTube and over 100,000 views on Facebook. The video was edited and designed by Paul Grignon.  Family life  Bossin lives on Gabriola Island, British Columbia with his wife, fabric artist and illustrator, Sima Elizabeth Shefrin. Shefrin's graphic novella, Embroidered Cancer Comic (Singing Dragon, London, 2016) is based on their life together after Bossin's 2011 diagnosis with prostate cancer. Shefrin also illustrated Bossin's chap book, Latkes (Nick Books, 2005). Bossin has two children, Madelyn (\\"Gee\\"), born in 1993 and Davy, born in 1999.

Early life The daughter and seventh child of Robert Sydnor Jennings‚Äîa World War II army veteran who earned a bachelor of science degree in agriculture at West Virginia State College, and completed partial work toward a master's degree at Michigan State College, Lansing, before becoming an extension agent‚ÄîLa Vinia Delois Jennings grew up on Meadowlark, the family farm in Halifax County, Virginia. Her mother, Ara Belle Brown Jennings, a Florida native, enlisted in the Women's Army Corps (WAC) in May 1944, less than one year after Congress and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt passed the bill into law on July 1, 1943, creating the WAC and discontinuing the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC). Jennings's great grandfather, Sydnor Johnston Jennings, was born at the conclusion of the Civil War and \\"worked as a sharecropper before coming into his own as a successful businessman who owned three farms.\\" Before his death in 1940, he donated the land for Green Valley School, \\"one of the nearly 5,000 Rosenwald schools, partially built with money contributed by Julius Rosenwald, the president of Sears, Roebuck, and Company, [to construct] schools for African Americans across the South in the early twentieth century.\\" In honor of her great grandfather, Jennings's family elders gave Halifax County the land to build Sydnor Jennings Elementary School, a larger, modern school across from the site of Green Valley School. It opened in the fall of 1962, prior to integration, and celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 2012. Education was extremely important to her father and great grandfather and many members of Jennings's immediate and extended family earned bachelor, master, and doctoral degrees and became educators in the arts and sciences. Education La Vinia Delois Jennings attended Meadville Elementary School and Halifax County Junior High School. She graduated from Halifax County Senior High School and was senior class secretary. Jennings took a bachelor of science degree in mass communications from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, where she was exposed to noted journalism scholars like David Manning White who had developed the ‚Äúgatekeeper‚Äù theory and published extensively on mass culture. During her junior and senior years, she wrote articles for The Commonwealth Times, the university's tabloid-format newspaper, contributing feature interviews with Ossie Davis and Nikki Giovanni and sociological interviews and discussions on the black homosexual and black Greek organizations. Because The Commonwealth Times, at that time, did not adequately address the university or racial concerns of people of color or offer them equal opportunity to hone their writing skills, she joined with a corps of students‚ÄîMarilyn Campbell, Ahmad Nurriddin, Pat Sherman, Sylvia Hicks, Keith Dabney, Jesse E. Vaughan, Jr. and others‚Äîto found Reflections In Ink, an alternative campus newspaper. She was the paper's first executive editor, and the publication was an important professionalizing stepping stone for its staff and contributors. Jesse E. Vaughan, Jr., for example, went on to work in electronic media and win twenty-seven Emmy Awards. Jennings also served as guests receptionist for the student-run Lecture Committee headed by Alexander \\"Buddy\\" Bryant. The appointment allowed her to establish professional and inspirational ties with singer Melba Moore, poets Maya Angelou and Carolyn Rodgers, social historian Lerone Bennett, Jr., news anchor Max Robinson, and many others. At her graduation, she was recognized with Virginia Commonwealth University President Edmund F. Ackell's Service and Leadership award. Immediately after her graduation from Virginia Commonwealth University, Seamark, Inc., Communicating Arts Consultants, based in the former Norfolk Public Library in Norfolk, Virginia, hired Jennings as its copywriter. Time Life also offered her a position in its Chicago office, but after a short time at Seamark, she opted to obtain a master of art in literature at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. She submitted ‚ÄúA Dramatic Adaption of William Hoffman‚Äôs Novel A Death of Dreams‚Äù as her thesis. Jennings then returned to Virginia Commonwealth University as a writing instructor for one year before leaving to pursue a doctorate in twentieth-century American and British literature at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. At the University of North Carolina, Jennings was J. Carlyle Sitterson Professor Trudier Harris's first dissertation student. Noted Southern literature specialist Louis D. Rubin, Jr. also served as a reader for her 1989 dissertation, ‚ÄúSexual Violence in the Works of Richard Wright, James Baldwin, and Toni Morrison.‚Äù After graduating, she accepted a position as a twentieth-century American literature and culture specialist with the English Department at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. University of North Carolina English Department head Joseph M. Flora and Professor Robert Bain's recruitment of her to write the chapter on Alice Childress for their Contemporary Poets, Dramatists, Essayists, and Novelists of the South led to her publishing Alice Childress (1995), the first book-length study on the Charleston, South Carolina, actress, novelist, and playwright and returning to print in 2006 Childress's only adult novel, A Short Walk (1979). A Choice reviewer called Alice Childress a ‚Äúcareful in- depth study‚Äù and ‚Äúan excellent work of dedicated scholarship.‚Äù Costanzo, A. Alice Childress. La Vinia Delois Jennings. Choice. March 1996. pp. 1134. Jennings received the John C. Hodges Excellence in Teaching Award, presented by the University of Tennessee's English Department, in 1994, and the Junior Faculty Teaching Award, given by the College of Arts and Sciences, in 1995. In 1999, she received the Jefferson Prize, an award given by the Chancellor and one of the University's highest. In 1998, Dr. Jennings was appointed a Fulbright Senior Lecturer at the University of M√°laga in the south of Spain. In 2008, Jennings won the Toni Morrison Society's Book Prize for Toni Morrison and the Idea of Africa (Cambridge UP). The critical study reveals the fundamental role African traditional religious symbols play in Morrison's work and the ways the Nobel Laureate and Pulitzer Prize-winning author uses‚Äîin her landscapes, interior spaces, and on the bodies of her characters‚Äîsymbols brought to the Americas by enslaved West Africans. Her analysis of these symbols demonstrates that a West African collective worldview informs both Morrison's work and contemporary African-American life and culture. Other books published by her included At Home and Abroad: Historicizing Twentieth Century Whiteness in Literature and Performance (U of Tennessee P, 2009), Zora Neale Hurston, Haiti, and Their Eyes Were Watching God (Northwestern UP, 2013), and Margaret Garner: The Premiere Performances of Toni Morrison‚Äôs Libretto (U of Virginia P, 2016). On May 25, 2018, the Margaret Garner volume received the Toni Morrison Society Book Prize 2015-17 for Best Edited Book on the work of the Nobel laureate.

It was the scene of several clashes in 1966, 1967 and 1968 and was finally captured People's Army of Vietnam forces in 1969. History From 1965 LS-36 was used as a forward base for U.S. Air Force combat search and rescue helicopters of the 38th Air Rescue Squadron. Two squadron helicopters would deploy at dawn from Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base to LS-36 and the crews would then pass the time awaiting distress calls from aircraft on missions over Laos or North Vietnam. At the end of the day the helicopters would return to Udorn. After overrunning Lima Site 27 on the night of 12 February 1966, on the early morning of 17 February 1966, Pathet Lao and People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) forces attacked LS-36. The attackers had a strength of 600‚Äì1000 men and included elements of the PAVN 5th Battalion, 168th Regiment. Advancing under mortar fire they seized high ground to the southeast of the airstrip, while the defenders responded with artillery fire. An AC-47 gunship provided fire support until dawn when a Raven FAC was able to take off and direct F-105 air strikes against the attackers. At 17:30 all Americans at the site were withdrawn by helicopter to Lima Site 48. At 04:30 on 18 February the Pathet Lao/PAVN renewed their attack on the site to be met with renewed air strikes after sunrise. Later that morning General Vang Pao arrived by helicopter to review the operations and this prompted a renewed attack wounding him before his helicopter made a hasty evacuation. U.S. Ambassador William H. Sullivan authorized the use of Napalm strikes for the first time in the war and two strikes took place that afternoon, but seemed to have little effect on the determined enemy. Later strikes were directed against ammunition and petroleum storage areas to prevent these falling into enemy hands. On 19 February the last Hmong forces withdrew from LS-36 and further airstrikes were made on Pathet Lao/PAVN positions and to destroy abandoned material. At least 70 Pathet Lao/PAVN bodies were counted while Hmong casualties were described as light. On 25 May 1966, Vang Pao's forces regained LS-36 from the Pathet Lao/PAVN. In December 1966, intelligence reports noted a buildup of PAVN forces for a potential attack on LS-36, Lima Site 52 or Lima Site 85. At 06:00 on 6 January 1967 a force of 600‚Äì800 PAVN attacked the base from the northwest, south and southwest. One of two U.S. advisers was killed in the initial attack, while the other was able to call for air support. The first strike package of F-105s arrived at 07:30 but were unable to attack due to low cloud cover at the base. Two A-1Es from the 602nd Fighter Squadron soon arrived over the base and were able to penetrate the cloud cover to hit the PAVN with rocket and cannon fire. These strikes held back the PAVN and allowed the Hmong to counterattack and restore a defensive perimeter. More A-1Es arrived over the base and the cloud cover began to lift allowing for increased airstrikes. The PAVN withdrew from the base leaving 40 dead and Vang Pao arrived to assume command of operations. During the night Nimrod A-26s patrolled over the base to prevent the PAVN from regrouping for a renewed attack. On the morning of 7 January more A-1s struck the base perimeter and likely egress routes. U.S./Hmong losses were 9 killed while the PAVN suffered 43 confirmed killed, with a further 200+ estimated to have been killed. Following the loss of Lima Site 85 on 10‚Äì11 March 1968, Ambassador Sullivan predicted an imminent attack against LS-36. In late April PAVN/Pathet Lao probes to the east of LS-36 increased and by the second week of May 215 of 239 Operation Barrel Roll sorties were dedicated to the site's defense causing the PAVN to draw back. PAVN strength was estimated at five battalions, approximately equal to the 1500 Hmong defenders of the base. On 20 May the PAVN renewed their attack but this was met with 60 sorties per day in defense, again blunting the attack. A counter-attack by Hmong forces in early June pushed the PAVN further from LS-36. In July 1968, following the loss of the TACAN site at Lima Site 85, the U.S. Air Force established a TACAN site at LS-36 as part of Operation Bright Light to support air operations over southern Laos and Vietnam. The site operated as TACAN Channel 77. The TACAN was operated by two technicians from the 1st Mobile Communications Group. On 28 February 1969, the PAVN 316th Division attacked LS-36 and by 1 March 1969 the Hmong forces abandoned the site to the PAVN. Current use The site is abandoned and turned over to farmland and housing.

The fringe is composed of thread-like teeth up to long with pale whitish tips, decreasing in size towards the front of the labellum. There are four rows of pale maroon, golf stick-shaped calli in the centre of the labellum, decreasing in size towards its tip. Flowering occurs from August to September. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia cruscula was first formally described by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown in 2001 from a specimen collected by Alex George in the Kau Rock Nature Reserve north east of Esperance. The description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (cruscula) is a Latin word meaning \\"little leg\\" and refers to the relatively short sepals and petals of this species, compared to those of similar orchids.  Distribution and habitat  The reclining spider orchid is found between Salmon Gums and Mount Ragged in the Coolgardie, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in moist places near granite outcrops, salt lakes and flats, usually under eucalypts or melaleucas. Conservation Caladenia cruscula is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

The group released their self- funded debut album, Streetsweeper, in April 2000. Evan Cater of AllMusic rated it at four-and-a-half stars out-of five and explained, \\"[it] features an impressive range of material, from the traditional and classical to the experimental and playful... [makes them] particularly well suited for the experimental 'nuevo tango' sound originally pioneered by Argentine composer Astor Piazzolla.\\" He described, \\"Their repertoire, which consists primarily of original instrumental compositions interspersed with occasional vocal pieces and innovative arrangements of popular orchestral works, is a lively blend of tango, European gypsy music, and jazz-influenced improvisation.\\" Their second album, Nekt√°r, was launched at The Famous Spiegeltent in December 2004. It was nominated for Best World Music Album at the ARIA Music Awards of 2005. The Ages correspondent caught their performance at Fitzroy Community Room in July 2005, \\"[their] sound requires a delicate dynamic balance and five pairs of keenly attuned ears. On Saturday night, the group's mainly original repertoire achieved this balance perfectly, each instrument rising and falling in carefully interlocking patterns that still left room for individual interpretation.\\" Sean Doyle of Radio National's Daily Planet played two tracks: for Mountfort's \\"La Mort de Jezebel\\", he described, \\"Italianate, sweetly bittersweet piece which originally depicted elderly people dancing tenderly at Melbourne's Melbourne Club\\", and for Csutoros' title track, he observed, \\"overtly Hungarian 'gypsy', but not in the cornball corner: a celebration of the composer's Magyar cultural inheritance & also remembers her childhood trip to Hungary, where she witnessed her father embrace his mother, twenty years since he'd last seen her.\\" Csutoros left in 2006 and was replaced by Sue Simpson. They followed with Bel Air, launched in August 2011. LotLs reviewer felt, \\"[it] takes the listener on a ride of passion in all its glorious colours ‚Äì heartfelt songs, bursts of wild virtuosic strings, soulful piano accordion, languid and lascivious laments grounded by infectious double bass grooves. Cosmo Cosmolino invites you to join them for a wild ride filled with laughter, tears, passion and mayhem.\\" Lucky Oceans previewed the album on Daily Planet, \\"[it] continues the string and accordion Melbourne quintet's explorations of classical, tango, klezmer, jazz and Brazilian musics, all with an emotional, surging sound and forward-propelling rhythm.\\" They toured Victoria from late July to early September 2011 in support of its release.

Early life and career Mario Falangola was born in Rome in 1880 and was admitted to the Italian Naval Academy in Livorno in 1899, graduating as ensign in 1902.Paolo Alberini, Franco Prosperini, Dizionario biografico Uomini della Marina 1861-1946, Ufficio Storico della Marina Militare, pp. 219-220. In 1911-1912, with the rank of Lieutenant, he participated in the Italo-Turkish War aboard the armored cruiser Giuseppe Garibaldi. When Italy entered World War I, Falangola was initially embarked on the battleship Leonardo Da Vinci, but after a short time he was transferred to the submarine service; in 1916 he became commander of the submarine Argo, and later of the submarine F 7. At the command of the latter, Falangola sank on 12 February 1918 the small Austro-Hungarian auxiliary vessel Pelagosa (245 GRT), and on August 11, 1918 the troop transport Euterpe (2,270 GRT), causing the loss of 555 Austro-Hungarian troops.Sommergibili classe F He was later given command of the submarine Lorenzo Marcello; in total, for his actions in command of submarines during World War I, Falangola received three Silver Medals of Military Valor and two Bronze Medals of Military Valor, as well as two promotions for war merit. In the interwar period, with the rank of Captain, he commanded in 1929 the destroyers Tigre and Leone, and in 1932 the battleship Giulio Cesare. That same year he was promoted to Rear Admiral and appointed Naval Commander of Sicily and then commander of the La Spezia Naval Base. In 1935 he was promoted to Vice Admiral and appointed inspector of the new constructions and commander of the submarine fleet; in October of the same year he attended the testing of the first SLC manned torpedoes, in La Spezia.Sergio Nesi, Decima Flottiglia nostra..., Mursia, Milano, 1986, pag. 17 The positive results of the test led him to order the building of a further two SLCs.Jack Greene e Alessandro Massignani, Il principe nero, Junio Valerio Borghese e la X¬™ MAS, Oscar Mondadori, 2008, page 20 In 1937 it became Admiral, and in 1939 he was briefly given command of the Corps of Port Captaincies. World War II and aftermath He later became commander of the Submarine Squadron (consisting of the whole Italian submarine fleet); he held this role at the entrance of Italy into World War II (June 10, 1940) and kept it until December 1941, directing the submarine operations of the Regia Marina in the Battle of the Mediterranean.Giorgio Giorgerini, Uomini sul fondo. Storia del sommergibilismo italiano dalle origini a oggi, pp. 171 to 310. On December 9, 1941, immediately after writing a long report which highlighted deficiencies of the Italian submarine branch (in terms of training, technical characteristics of submarines, operational doctrine, cooperation with the Air Force), Falangola was removed from office and appointed commander of the Corps of Port Captaincies, and was replaced in command of the submarine fleet by Admiral Antonio Legnani.Giorgio Giorgerini, Uomini sul fondo. Storia del sommergibilismo italiano dalle origini a oggi, p. 310. A fervent Fascist, after the 8 September 1943 armistice Falangola immediately spoke out in favor of cooperation with the German forces, and during meetings at the Ministry of the Navy he tried ‚Äì without much success ‚Äì to convince other officers to do the same. He immediately joined the Italian Social Republic, and on September 30, 1943 he became Commissioner for the Navy for the Open City of Rome.Giuseppe Fioravanzo, La Marina dall'8 settembre 1943 alla fine del conflitto, pp. 120-121. He left this office on December 25, 1943, again assuming the general command the Port Captaincies that had remained in the territory of Italian Social Republic; he held this role until April 1945. His sons, Carlo and Ettore, also joined the RSI as officers in Junio Valerio Borghese's Decima Flottiglia MAS; they were employed against the Italian resistance and were both captured and executed by the partisans.http://www.mymilitaria.it/liste/BattaglioneCastagnacci.htmhttp://www.verbaniamilleventi.org/giornopergiorno/?p=364 Having joined the German troops in their retreat towards Brenner Pass, at the beginning of May 1945 Falangola gave himself up in Bolzano to the Northern Italy National Liberation Committee, which in turn handed him over to the local U.S. command, that interned him in a POW camp in Coltano, Pisa, where he remained for a short time. After his release, he was deprived of his rank by the Italian authorities for having adhered to the Italian Social Republic, and he was sentenced to four years (later condoned) by a military court in Rome. The sentence, however, was repealed once by the Supreme Military Court \\"for not having committed the crime\\", and then a second time for an amnesty. He was discharged from the Navy in June 1945. In 1955, his service record was reviewed and the cancellation from the rolls with loss of rank was revoked. He died in Rome on 14 July 1967.

Alcohols applied to the skin are used to disinfect skin before a needle stick and before surgery. They may be used both to disinfect the skin of the person and the hands of the healthcare providers. They can also be used to clean other areas and in mouthwashes. Taken by mouth or injected into a vein, ethanol is used to treat methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity when fomepizole is not available. Side effects of alcohols applied to the skin include skin irritation. Care should be taken with electrocautery, as ethanol is flammable. Types of alcohol used include ethanol, denatured ethanol, 1-propanol, and isopropyl alcohol. Alcohols are effective against a range of microorganisms, though they do not inactivate spores. Concentrations of 60 to 90% work best. Alcohol has been used as an antiseptic as early as 1363, with evidence to support its use becoming available in the late 1800s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Commercial formulations of alcohol based hand rub or with other agents such as chlorhexidine are available. Medical uses Applied to the skin, alcohols are used to disinfect skin before a needle stick and before surgery. They may be used both to disinfect the skin of the person and the hands of the healthcare providers. They can also be used to clean other areas, and in mouthwashes. Taken by mouth or injected into a vein ethanol is used to treat methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity when fomepizole is not available. Aside from these uses, ethanol has no other well-accepted medical uses. This is partly because the therapeutic index of ethanol is 10:1. Methanol poisoning Taken by mouth or injected into a vein ethanol is used to treat methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity when fomepizole is not available. Mechanism Ethanol, when used for toxicity, competes with other alcohols for the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, lessening metabolism into toxic aldehyde and carboxylic acid derivatives, and reducing more serious toxic effect of the glycols to crystallize in the kidneys. History Alcohol has been used as an antiseptic as early as 1363 with evidence to support its use becoming available in the late 1800s.

He illustrated The Knight in the Tiger‚Äôs Skin, a poem, decorated in print with his illustrations, which was twice published in Berlin in German translation. It was also published in Tbilisi, Moscow, Yerevan and Japan. Levan Tsutskiridze is also the author of the design and illustrations of more than thirty books.  Early life  Levan Tsutskiridze was born in the small town of Khashuri. Most of his childhood was spent in a small village, Moliti, in mountainous Imereti. When he was eleven he lost his father who became a victim of the 1937 repressions. From that day the poverty, oppression and eviction of the family began. Levan Tsutskiridze received primary education at Tbilisi public school. In 1946, he continued his studies by taking classes on painting and graphic arts at Tbilisi State Academy of Arts. He graduated the Academy in 1957. He had studied for twelve years, as from the very first year he was put on a black list; they were punishing him as a disobedient (obstinate) student. He was pushed back from the second academic year to the first, from the fourth to the first; from painting to graphic department; they persisted in punishing him as a \\"formalist\\". The punishment went on even after he graduated the Academy of Arts and the post-graduate course too, now, by means of expelling his works from the exhibition list. The artist's first personal exhibition was held in 1959 in Tbilisi, at the Union of Architects of Georgia. The exhibition proved his artistic manner to originate from the Georgian traditional fresco, at the same time bearing individual features. In 1976, a large canvas called ‚ÄúAspiration‚Äù was installed in the port of Poti. In 1977 a monumental picture ‚ÄúKolkheti‚Äù- in the town of Senaki and ‚ÄúCherishable‚Äù based on The Knight in the Tiger‚Äôs Skin by Shota Rustaveli at the House of Union of Writers of Georgia. In 1958, for the first time, he participated in the republican exhibition with the painting ‚Äò‚ÄôToast‚Äô‚Äô. The exhibition lasted the whole month, but his picture hung at the Blue Gallery for three days. His illustrations of The Knight in the Tiger‚Äôs Skin and painting ‚Äò‚ÄôDance‚Äô‚Äô suffered the same fate. In the end recognition finally happened, but with difficulty. During 1960 and 1970, he was a professor of Tbilisi Academy of Arts and Polytechnic Institute of Georgia (by turns), while during 1971 and 2005 a professor of Chair of Drawing of Tbilisi Academy of Arts. In 1984-88 he completed frescoes paintings on three walls of the Sioni Cathedral. In 1997 ‚Äò‚ÄôData Tutashkhia‚Äô‚Äô by Chabua Amirejibi with his illustrations was published. Levan Tsutskiridze also illustrated the seven volume edition of Chabua Amirejibi works published by the ‚Äò‚ÄôMagticom‚Äô‚Äô company in 2001.  Exhibitions  * 1958 Republic Exhibition. Tbilisi.

Comlot is a body established by the concordat (Swiss Intercantonal Convention on Licensing and Supervision of Intercantonal and National Lotteries and Bets, IVLW) between the Swiss Cantons regarding lotteries and bets. It has its seat in Berne.  Founding and organisation  Comlot commenced its certification and oversight tasks on July 1, 2006.  Commission  The Commission of Comlot, the Swiss Lottery and Betting Board, consists of five members including President, Jean-Fran√ßois Roth. The Comlot President and Commission members are proposed by the Swiss cantonal Executives; they are elected by the Swiss Conference of Cantonal Directors - Lottery Market and Lottery Act FDKL.  Secretariat  The Commission of Comlot relies upon the services of a permanent secretariat. The Comlot secretariat prepares commission transactions, submits motions and implements ist decisions. As of June 2019, the secretariat employs 16 people. Manuel Richard is the director of the secretariat.  Tasks   Licensing  Comlot is responsible for licensing large-scale gambling (i.e. lotteries, sports betting and skill-based games) run online, intercantonally or by automated means. Before granting a License, Comlot evaluates the addictive potential of the lottery, betting or skill game envisaged. Depending on such evaluation, Comlot may demand additional protective measures from the operator.  Supervision  Comlot monitors large-scale gambling in Switzerland comprehensively and is actively involved in the fight against illegal large-scale activities. Monitoring of licensed skill games, lotteries and sports betting and their operators are further supervisory tasks of Comlot. The Gambling Act also entrusts Comlot with important responsibilities with regard to taking steps against competition manipulation in sports.  Expertise for the cantons  For all gambling-related issues, Comlot is the contact of choice for media and the public.  Goals  Comlot supervises the enforcement of the Federal Act on Gambling, of the Ordinance, and of the Swiss Intercantonal Convention. It ensures that residents of Switzerland can participate safely in lotteries, sports bets and skill-based gambling. The legislator and its regulating bodies focus especially on gambling-related problems (in particular on gambling addiction) and gambling-related criminality (in particular on game manipulation and money laundering). At the same time, these regulations are intended to ensure that the state will receive a large portion of the proceeds from gambling activities, whereby all benefits generated from lotteries and bets must be used for welfare.

The series is based on the Lalaloopsy dolls from MGA Entertainment, and is a reboot of the American animated television series Lalaloopsy on Nickelodeon. It debuted on Netflix on January 10, 2017. Premise This Netflix Original series is a reboot of Lalaloopsy, a Nick Jr. series that first aired in 2013. While they both share the basic premise of rag dolls having adventures in Lalaloopsy Land, the exact details of each series are very different. 48 unique lalaloopsies appeared in the original series. In contrast, We‚Äôre Lalaloopsy only features 10 characters, a significant downgrade from 48.

Sky (who previously appeared in Lalaloopsy Girls: Welcome to L.A.L.A Prep School) gradually becoming accepted in Lalaloopsy Land. Another difference from the original series is that We‚Äôre Lalaloopsy contains a slightly different art style that emphasizes the dolls‚Äô mouths more. Unlike Lalaloopsy, the lalaloopsies are now voiced by adults. Characters Main * Jewel Sparkles (voiced by Kazumi Evans) is a girly princess who loves tiaras and primping.

Bouroncle Pereny (September 10, 1919 ‚Äì August 13, 2013) was a Peruvian-American hematologist. After completing medical school in Peru, Bouroncle came to the United States for her postgraduate medical training. A longtime member of the faculty at the Ohio State University College of Medicine, she was the first investigator to identify hairy cell leukemia and the first female full professor in the state of Ohio. In the 1980s, Bouroncle and two colleagues developed a drug to treat hairy cell leukemia. She was named a professor emerita at the medical school in 1989. Bouroncle died in 2013. She was predeceased by her husband Andrew Pereny, a businessman and erstwhile ceramic artist. Early life Bouroncle was born in Trujillo, Peru. She was the fourth of five children in her family. Bouroncle, whose father Luis was a Harvard University alumnus, went to medical school at the National University of San Marcos. When she was not studying, Bouroncle gained experience by providing free medical care to fishermen in Pucusana. She also held a job as a laboratory research assistant, leading to an interest in hematology. The only female in her medical school graduating class in 1947, Bouroncle was the class valedictorian. Career In 1948, Bouroncle left Peru to complete a postdoctoral fellowship at Ohio State. Between 1949 and 1953, she completed residency and fellowship training at the university in internal medicine and hematology. She spent the next year at Ohio State as a chief resident in medicine; she was the first female in Ohio to serve as a chief resident. Bouroncle was hired at Ohio State in the hematology-oncology division as an assistant professor in 1954. Bouroncle was named an associate professor in 1957. Working with two junior colleagues the next year, Bouroncle identified a blood disorder known as hairy cell leukemia. She was named a full professor in 1970 and a professor emerita in 1989. She was the first female full professor of a medical school in Ohio. For many years, Bouroncle was on the medical staff of the Ohio State University Hospital. Among her colleagues, Bouroncle was noted for her commanding presence in spite of her small stature. Her associates said that she held trainees to very high standards without making them feel badly about themselves. She considered herself to be a shy person, but she found that she could open her heart to her patients. Continuing her research with hairy cell leukemia, Bouroncle worked with Ohio State investigators Michael Grever and Eric Kraut in the 1980s to develop a treatment for the disease known as deoxycoformycin. She helped to found The James Cancer Hospital, which opened at Ohio State in 1990. She won several teaching-related awards at Ohio State. Personal life In 1960, Bouroncle met businessman Andrew Pereny in Peru and they later married. Before he had become successful in business, Pereny produced a collection of ceramic art between 1933 and 1938. Several decades later, Pereny's work piqued the interest of art collectors because of his brief tenure as an artist. Pereny died in 1983. Bouroncle funded the Bertha Bouroncle, MD, and Andrew Pereny Chair of Medicine at Ohio State. Outside of medicine, Bouroncle enjoyed the Columbus Symphony Orchestra. Later life Ohio State established the Bertha Bouroncle Distinguished Lecture Award in 2001. Bouroncle donated $200,000 to the National University of San Marcos to build a new research laboratory. The school named the laboratory in her honor. She died at the Richard M. Ross Heart Hospital in 2013.

Directly responsible to the Reich Main Security Office (, RSHA) in Berlin, EG Serbia consisted of representatives of the various offices () of the RSHA, particularly Amt IV ‚Äì the Gestapo (Secret State Police), Amt V ‚Äì the Kriminalpolizei (Criminal Police, or Kripo), and Amt VI ‚Äì the Ausland-Sicherheitsdienst (Foreign Intelligence Service, or Ausland-SD). It also controlled the 64th Reserve Police Battalion of the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police, Orpo). While formally responsible to the Military Commander in Serbia via the head of the administrative branch of the military headquarters of the occupied territory, the chief of EG Serbia reported directly to his superiors in Berlin. Background Pre-war activities in Yugoslavia In 1936, the chief of the Belgrade General Police, Dragomir Jovanoviƒá attended the International Police Conference in Berlin, along with two subordinates. Jovanoviƒá's Belgrade General Police were the political police of the Belgrade City Administration, and had been closely involved in the suppression of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia since it was banned in 1920. At the conference, Jovanoviƒá supported the motion of the Polish delegates to extend the activities of the International Criminal Police Commission to cooperation against international communism. He also supported the candidature of the director of the German Gestapo, Reinhard Heydrich, to be president of the Commission, and had discussions with Gestapo officials about the fight against international communism. In January 1937, Jovanoviƒá again travelled to Berlin, this time with Milan Aƒáimoviƒá, the Belgrade City Administrator, who was also a confidant of the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, Milan Stojadinoviƒá. The two Yugoslavs met with Reichsf√ºhrer-SS and Chief of German Police in the Reich Ministry of the Interior, Heinrich Himmler, and Heydrich, and agreed on cooperation and the exchange of police liaison officers between Yugoslavia and Germany. In early January 1938, SS- Sturmbannf√ºhrer (SS-Major) Hans Helm was appointed as a police attach√© to the German diplomatic mission in Belgrade. Helm was a protege of the senior Gestapo official, Heinrich M√ºller, and his appointment to the position was encouraged by Jovanoviƒá and Aƒáimoviƒá, whom he had met when they visited Berlin. The German ambassador, Viktor von Heeren, was a former member of the diplomatic corps of the pre-Nazi Weimar Republic, and was wary of Helm and his role, and concerned about what impact the Gestapo official would have on Germany's relationship with the Stojadinoviƒá government. In December 1938, Aƒáimoviƒá was appointed as Minister of the Interior in the Stojadinoviƒá cabinet, but in early February of the following year, Stojadinoviƒá fell from power, and Aƒáimoviƒá also lost his portfolio. At the same time, Jovanoviƒá was transferred to an advisory role in the Ministry of the Interior. However, both men maintained their contact with Helm, with Jovanoviƒá allegedly permitting a secret German Abwehr (military intelligence) radio to be installed in his home. Helm maintained contact with several Germanophile officials within the Belgrade City Administration, including a White √©migr√© Russian, Nikolaj Gubarev, an agent with the anti-communist Section IV of the Belgrade General Police. Helm cultivated Gubarev as an informant, part of an intelligence network he established throughout the country to collect political and military information, including information about British and French intelligence services operating in Yugoslavia. Helm's connection to Gubarev was known by the intelligence staff of the Supreme Command of the Royal Yugoslav Army, and as a result, in late 1939, Gubarev was transferred away from Belgrade. In addition to his intelligence work, Helm also collected commercial information, helping a German company obtain a concession to explore for oil in Yugoslavia ahead of British interests. On 27 September 1939, the Gestapo and its parent organisation, the Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police, or SiPo), was placed under the umbrella of the new Reich Main Security Office (, RSHA), now commanded by Heydrich, and the Gestapo became Amt (Office) IV of the RSHA, with M√ºller as its chief. Helm was under strict instructions not to deal with any people or organisations that were in opposition to the Yugoslav government. This responsibility fell to SS- Sturmbannf√ºhrer Karl Kraus, who belonged to Amt VI of the RSHA, the Ausland- Sicherheitsdienst (Foreign Intelligence Service, or Ausland-SD). Kraus arrived in Belgrade soon after the RSHA was formed, under the cover that he was an economic adviser to the German Transportation Bureau in Belgrade. The German Transportation Bureau was an organisation established to promote the interests of German transportation companies, including the Deutsche Reichsbahn (German State Railway), the airline Deutsche Lufthansa, and the shipping lines Hamburg America Line and Norddeutscher Lloyd. The director of the German Transportation Bureau was the official representative of the Nazi Party in Yugoslavia, Franz Neuhausen. Kraus was responsible for organising fifth column activities among the ethnic Germans of Yugoslavia, and ran lectures for them at the former Czechoslovakian embassy in Belgrade. Neuhausen used his considerable influence to assist Kraus in his duties. On one occasion in April 1940, Kraus and his assistant, SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Adolf Nassenstein, were travelling to Dubrovnik on the Adriatic coast without permission from the Yugoslav authorities and were arrested by the Yugoslav police in Mostar. They were charged and orders were issued for their expulsion from Yugoslavia. Neuhausen arranged for their release and for the charges to be dropped and the expulsion orders cancelled. Kraus cultivated a network of informants which included members of the Yugoslav government, the fascist Yugoslav National Movement (, Zbor) of Dimitrije Ljotiƒá, the Russian White √©migr√© community, and ethnic Germans. One of Kraus' most significant informants was Tanasije Diniƒá. In the spring of 1940, Nassenstein was transferred to Zagreb to consolidate contacts among Croatian separatists and counter the work of the British and French intelligence services there. The Tripartite Pact and the coup d'√©tat Following the 1938 Anschluss between Germany and Austria, Yugoslavia came to share a border with the Third Reich and fell under increasing pressure as her neighbours aligned themselves with the Axis powers. In April 1939, Italy opened a second frontier with Yugoslavia when it invaded and occupied neighbouring Albania. At the outbreak of World War II, the Yugoslav government declared its neutrality. Between September and November 1940, Hungary and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact, aligning themselves with the Axis, and Italy invaded Greece. From that time, Yugoslavia was almost completely surrounded by the Axis powers and their satellites, and her neutral stance toward the war became strained. In late February 1941, Bulgaria joined the Pact. The following day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia. Intending to secure his southern flank for the impending attack on the Soviet Union, Adolf Hitler began placing heavy pressure on Yugoslavia to join the Axis. On 25 March 1941, after some delay, the Yugoslav government conditionally signed the Pact. Two days later, a group of pro-Western, Serbian nationalist Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force officers deposed the country's regent, Prince Paul, in a bloodless coup d'√©tat, placed his teenaged nephew Peter on the throne, and brought to power a \\"government of national unity\\" led by General Du≈°an Simoviƒá. The coup enraged Hitler, who immediately ordered the country's invasion. When the coup occurred, Helm was visiting Berlin, and Kraus was in Belgrade. Establishment alt=a black and white photograph of two men in uniform Immediately following the coup, Heydrich summoned SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Walter Schellenberg, the acting head of the Ausland-SD, and ordered him to compile a list of all Yugoslavs who were opposed to Nazi Germany, so they could be arrested during and after the pending invasion. This list was assembled hastily and contained a number of errors, but quickly came to comprise over 4,000 names. Heydrich then appointed SS-Standartenf√ºhrer (SS-Colonel) Wilhelm Fuchs to lead Einsatzgruppe Yugoslavia (EG Yugoslavia), consisting of police and security detachments, which would be responsible for arresting those on the list. Fuchs had been the head of a SD detachment in occupied Poland. On 1 April, Fuchs went to Vienna, where he gathered about 60 SD and Gestapo officials, including experts in Yugoslavian affairs such as Helm and SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Wilhelm Beissner, who was head of the Yugoslav section of the Ausland-SD office in Berlin. When the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia commenced on 6 April, Fuchs and the main body of EG Yugoslavia were in Graz with the German 2nd Army, and a smaller Einsatzkommando (EK) led by SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Jonak was with German troops preparing to invade Yugoslavia from Romania. On 8 April, Fuchs and his men were in Maribor, and commenced arresting people on the list. However, the rapid success of the invasion meant that by 13 April, he was in Zagreb, so he quickly formed a second EK under Beissner to operate in the newly created Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH). Map showing the partition of Yugoslavia after the Axis invasion German forces entered Belgrade on 12 April, two days later, Jonak and his EK had arrived, where they were met by Kraus, who had weathered the bombing of Belgrade in the basement of the former Czechoslovakian embassy. The next day, the remainder of Fuchs' EG Yugoslavia arrived in the capital. The young King Peter and his government fled the country on 15 April, and Yugoslav forces surrendered unconditionally two days later. On that day, Heydrich arrived in Belgrade and met with Fuchs and the rest of the EG Yugoslavia staff, including Helm and Kraus. Heydrich explained that Germany and its allies were partitioning Yugoslavia. Some Yugoslav territory was annexed by its Axis neighbors, Hungary, Bulgaria and Italy. The Germans had engineered and supported the creation of the NDH, which roughly comprised most of the pre-war Banovina Croatia, along with rest of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and some adjacent territory. The Italians, Hungarians and Bulgarians occupied other parts of Yugoslavian territory. Germany did not annex any Yugoslav territory, but occupied northern parts of present-day Slovenia and stationed occupation troops in the northern half of the NDH. The German-occupied part of Slovenia was divided into two administrative areas that were placed under the administration of the Gauleiters of the neighboring Reichsgau K√§rnten and Reichsgau Steiermark. The remaining territory, which consisted of Serbia proper, the northern part of Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat was occupied by the Germans and placed under the administration of a German military government. This was due to the key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it, and its valuable resources, particularly non-ferrous metals. Heydrich appointed Helm as head of the Gestapo in the occupied Serbian territory, and Kraus as the chief of EK Belgrade, with Fuchs remaining as head of EG Yugoslavia, with primary responsibility for the German-occupied territory of Serbia. Fuchs was also temporarily responsible for the three EKs established within the NDH, headquartered at Zagreb, Sarajevo and Osijek. Jonak was given responsibility for exploiting the Yugoslav archives on behalf of the RSHA. Operations Heydrich returned to Berlin on the same day, and EG Yugoslavia immediately got to work, establishing EK Belgrade in the district prison on King Alexander I Street, and sending SS-Sonderkommandos (ad hoc task forces, or SS-SKs) into the interior of the occupied territory on various tasks. One of these SS-SKs, commanded by SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Karl Hintze, located the Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Gavrilo V, whose name was on the list given to Fuchs. He was sheltering in Italian occupied Montenegro at the Ostrog Monastery, and was arrested and transferred to the Belgrade prison. The same SS-SK seized hundreds of millions of Yugoslav dinar notes and some gold that the fleeing Yugoslav government had been unable to take with it. Within the NDH, EK Sarajevo was established under SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Alfred Heinrich, and in Bulgarian annexed Skoplje another EK was established under SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Rupert Mandl. In Hungarian-annexed territory, SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer Karl Pamer led another EK at Novi Sad, and in the ethnic German-administered Banat, SS- Obersturmf√ºhrer Zoeller set up his EK initially at Panƒçevo, and later moved it to Veliki Beƒçkerek. In the first weeks of the occupation, EK Belgrade's SS- Obersturmf√ºhrer Fritz M√ºller led a SS-SK in searching for those on the list, but he lacked the manpower for the task, and relied heavily on the Abwehr and Geheime Feldpolizei (Secret Field Police), to locate and arrest the wanted people. This search for wanted persons was the main initial task of EG Yugoslavia, and resulted in the sending of many arrested people to the Gestapo in Graz, or to concentration camps in the Third Reich. The roundup included diplomatic staff in various posts, including Berlin, despite this being a breach of diplomatic immunity. Documents obtained from the Yugoslav embassy in Berlin by Schellenberg's men indicated that the Yugoslav military attach√©, Pukovnik (Colonel) Vladimir Vauhnik, had been obtaining information from the top echelons of the Wehrmacht, as he had advised Belgrade of detailed information about the Axis invasion two days before it began. As soon as the invasion was over, Kraus became aware that former Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragi≈°a Cvetkoviƒá was seeking to return to power under German authority. Based on his work in Yugoslavia before the invasion, Kraus wrote a report recommending against this course of action.

It was built in 1872. The synagogue burnt down during the pogrom of 1905, but in 1913-1914 the building was restored. In 1935, the synagogue was closed for worship. After World War II the building was again transferred to the local Jewish community. Soldier Synagogue has the status of an object of cultural heritage of regional significance.  History  In 1862, retired Jewish soldiers established Jewish Prayer Society in Rostov-on-Don. On May 31, 1862 Yekaterinoslav province government gave to society a permission to rent a separate room for worship rituals. The project of Choral Synagogue was approved by Rosotov authorities on June 4, 1872, and in the same year the building was constructed. According to some reports, the money for the construction of synagogues were donated by Rostov merchant Joseph Markovich Elitser. It is presumed that the architect of the synagogue was Ernst Ernestovich von Shulman, and the building contractor ‚Äï Moisey Leontyevich Geronimus. The synagogue building was reconstructed several times. In 1881, in the east part of it there was attached a three-story brick building. In 1891, to the south wall of the synagogue there was also attached a two-storey building, the ground floor of which housed a school for children of poor soldiers, and the second floor was occupied by Prayer school. Synagogue was seriously damaged by fire during the anti-Jewish pogrom in 1905. It was restored only in 1913-1914, when the necessary funds were collected. The author of the reconstruction project was Petersburg architect Yakov Germanovich Gevirts. Worship in the synagogue resumed on March 29, 1914, on the day of Passover. In 1935, the synagogue was closed for worship. The building housed a chemical factory. During the war, these enterprises were evacuated from the city. In 1943, after the liberation of Rostov-on-Don synagogue was taken again by the Jewish community. Official permission to use the building by the Jewish community was sanctioned on April 14, 1945. In 2005 a major overhaul of the synagogue was implemented. Corner dome with stars of David that were lost in the 1940s were restored. Reconstruction works were completed by the end of the year and on 26 December synagogue was opened.  Architecture  The architecture of Soldier Synagogue has elements of Art Nouveau and Oriental styles. The building has a complex configuration plan. Three parts of building volume are reduced to north-south axis. Light openings in the top of the bindings are patterned, stylized with gothic rose.

Akinmusire's empathy with tenorist Smith gives an updated Miles Davis/Wayne Shorter atmosphere to jolting faster pieces such as Jaya, and the bass and drums pairing nails everything with steely relish.\\" Will Layman of PopMatters noted \\"Kudos to Blue Note president Bruce Lundvall for getting Ambrose Akinmusire and his band into the studio.

It was built by Pierre Le Marinier towards the end of Louis XIII‚Äôs reign and served as a family residence. Only minor changes were made in the following years and it was not even damaged during the French Revolution. Around 1830, the House of Montmorency had the building renovated and partially changed. Later on, the estate passed into the hands of the House of Hunolstein and finally, in the first quarter of the 20th century, it passed into the possession of the Dreux-Br√©z√© family, whose descendants are still the owners of the ch√¢teau today. Some areas of the ch√¢teau, which is located about two kilometers south of the center of Cany-Barville, were classified as a \\"monument historique\\" and preserved as cultural heritage on April 14, 1930. On December 7, 1990, further parts of the estate became part of cultural heritage management.  History  The land on which the ch√¢teau was built in the 17th century was formerly part of the Seigneurie of Barville, which had been in the possession of the Le Marinier family since the end of the 16th century. In 1626, Pierre Le Marinier was appointed Lord of Barville. On August 18, 1634, he then went on to buy the adjacent Seigneurie Cany from Adrien de Breaut√© and united the two lordships to form the new Seigneurie Cany. In 1640, he started the construction of a ch√¢teau in Louis XIII style. Even though it was built on the land of the former Seigneurie Barville, it was named after the Seigneurie Cany. The ch√¢teau replaced the family‚Äôs former residence in Barville, which was less representative and more modest consisting of a residential building, a stable, a cowshed, a carriage house, some barns, a dovecot, a woodshed, a building where the wine press was located, and various other buildings. A description dated from 1700 shows that this residence still existed at the beginning of the 18th century. The new ch√¢teau was constructed within six years. It is not known which architect provided the plans for the new building. Possibly, it was Fran√ßois Mansart, however, this has not yet been proven. The end of construction was passed on in a report which recounts the visit of Nicolas de Paris to the chapel of Barville in 1646. At that time, Nicolas de Paris, a vicar general of Fran√ßois II de Harley, was the archbishop of Rouen. On May 13, 1624, after the construction of the main building had been finished, Pierre Le Marinier bought the adjacent barony of Caniel from Jacques de La Taille for 16,500 livres With the death of Pierre Le Marinier in 1662, his son Balthazar Le Marinier not only inherited the ch√¢teau but also a large amount of real estate. Balthazar Le Marinier married Genevi√®ve der Becdeli√®vre in 1663 and sold the ch√¢teau and the Seigneurie Cany (excluding the barony of Caniel) to his father-in-law Pierre III de Becdeli√®vre, Marquis de Qu√©villy, on June 3, 1683. Pierre IV, Pierre III de Becdeli√®vre's son, repurchased the barony of Caniel in June, 1713. Following the death of Pierre IV, who did not leave any children, in 1726, he was succeeded by his nephew Claude. In 1728, Claude's younger brother Louis became the owner of the castle. Louis' son, Pierre Jacques Louis, inherited the estate in 1740. 20 years later, he commissioned Chaussard, a Parisian architect, to change or finish the working quarters located south of the ch√¢teau as well as the French formal garden including two parterres, and various ponds and canals. In 1711, the ch√¢teau and the Lordship fell into the hands of Louis' grandchild Anne Louis Roger, who died on June 26, 1789. He passed Ch√¢teau Cany on to his daughter Armande Louise Marie, who married Anne Christian de Montmorency- Louxembourg on January 18, 1789. During the French Revolution, the property of aristocrats who had left the country was confiscated. This caused Anne Louis Roger to divorce her husband in 1792 in order to save her property, despite the emigration of her husband. However, she and her sister were arrested and imprisoned during the French revolution. Ch√¢teau Cany was eventually confiscated anyway and served as a prison. Eventually, Armande could convince the authorities to return the family property in 1795. After Anne Christian de Montmorency-Luxembourg was omitted from the list of aristocrats that had emigrated, the couple re-married and inhabited Ch√¢teau Cany themselves from 1802 onwards. Ch√¢teau Cany at the end of the 19th century Around 1830, their son Anne Edouard Loius Joseph de Montmorency-Luxembourg had the entire estate renovated and the interior modernized. This included the restoration of the fa√ßade and the redesign of the garden into a landscape garden. At that time also the main stairway, which is accessible from two sides, was constructed at the southern front of the main building . Antoine-Nicolas Louis Bailly provided the plans for it. As the marriage between Edouard and L√©onie de Croix de Dadizeele did not produce a son, the daughters inherited the fortune and divided up the property. Anne-Marie Josephe, the older sister of the two, inherited Ch√¢teau Cany and procured it for her husband Antoine d'Hunolstein. Because her grandchild, Anne-Marie d'Hunolstein, married Louis de Dreux-Br√©z√© in 1926, the estate fell into the hands of his family. 2011, Laure Normand took possession of the estate, which had previously been in the possession of her father Antoine de Dreux-Br√©z√©. Since then she and her husband have been managing the business. The family has not lived in the ch√¢teau itself for more than 30 years but occupied one of the former working quarters southwest of the main building. Until 2006, annual horse driving trials organized by the √âcole Sainte Jeanne d'Arc took place in the park of the estate. The main building has been transformed into a museum for interior design, but is currently (as of October, 2016) closed for renovations. The park can be viewed for a small fee in July and August of every year.  Description  The castle is situated in the valley of the river Durdent in the midst of a park, which has geometrically shaped areas of water fed by the Durdent and covers 30 hectares. In earlier times the complex marked the crossing of two roads, about 50 kilometers northwest of Rouen: the road from F√©camp to Dieppe and that from Yvetot to Veulettes-sur-Mer.  Architecture  A 280-meter-long avenue leads lineally from the west to a paled gate, which bears the coat of arms of the Becdeli√©vre family. It is one of four gates which grant access to the large courtyard, which covers about 68 √ó 151 m2 and is located south of the castle. It consists of several rectangular lawns, which are separated from each other by symmetrically designed paths. The southern end of the courtyard forms a semicircle, which is bounded by a wide ditch. Two elongated and symmetrically designed sections of the building form the eastern and western side walls of the yard. These wings were once used for economic purposes. They date back to 1702 and are thus younger than the main castle. In former times the buildings were used as royal stables and carriage houses. North of these wings two detached and three-axled pavilions are located. The buildings were put up around 1700 and mark the southern corners of the ditch which surrounds the residential building. The eastern pavilion once served as the palace chapel and the western one was used as a repository. Their slate-tiled roofs were renewed in 2010, last in 1890. S√ºdansicht des Logis The residential building is located on a rectangular island and is surrounded on all sides by an 11.5 meter-wide ditch. At the south side the island can be accessed via a brick bridge built in 1782, which at that time had replaced the drawbridge. The residential building covered the whole north side. There is no main courtyard in front of the main building as was usually the case, but instead a graveled promenade, which is surrounded by a stone balustrade. The two-storied castle was built with regional materials and is typical of the Louis XIII style. Its design is determined by the colors of its building materials. Red bricks were used for the walls, bright cut stone for window and door frames and dark slate for the roofs. In French this kind of stonework design is called brique-et-pierre. The castle was built from 1640 to 1646 and since then has barely been changed, which contributes to its very uniform appearance. The castle consists of a seven-axled Corps de Logis, which is bounded on the north and the east by short pavilion-like wings having two axes and two floors. All three parts of the building have slate-tiled hip roofs, the roofs of the side wings being higher than the roof of the central wing. All window openings have segmental arches with a closer. The windows of the raised ground floor are furnished with a triangular gable. The upper floors of the side wings are decorated with round arches. The brick walls of the spaces between the windows are rendered in a bright color. The three central arches of the Corps de logis converge at the height of the roof under a rounded arch. A double-flight staircase leads to the middle entrance at the southside of the raised ground floor. The staircase is shaped like a horseshoe and has stone balusters.  Interior  A lot of the furniture dating back to the 17th and the 18th century has been preserved and is now part of the museum for interior design in the castle. The completeness of the collection is remarkable, since often, the furniture of French castles was sold during the French Revolution and ended up in various places all over the country. The most impressive pieces that are presented to visitors include various family portraits, Asian porcelain and a lavishly designed state bed. The most important works of historical art, however, are the various tapestries dating back to the 15th and 16th century, which the count of Hunolstein had had restored and which were presented in an exhibition by the Parisian Mus√©e des Arts d√©coratifs in 1880. The former working quarters, including some storage units, the wine cellar, the servants' day room and the castle kitchen, in which the old utensils and dishes are displayed, are located on the ground floor of the main building. Two staircases situated in the side wings connect the ground floors with the upper floors. It is believed that they date from the 18th century when they replaced former, less intricately designed staircases. detail of a Flemish tapestry On the raised ground floor of the main building, the drawing rooms are located. In the east side wing, there is an apartment, while the west side wing houses an extensive library of 4000 works. In the Corps de logis, three bordering rooms can be found; one big room in the center flanked by two smaller parlors. The green parlor (French: salon vert) has panels in r√©gence style containing elements of Rococo art and various motifs from hunting and music. It might formerly have served as a music room. The second parlor served as a dining room and has white panels in Louis XVI style. The top floors of the two pavillons on the sides of the building contain further apartments with the same floorplans as those located on the raised ground floor of the pavillon to the east. The Corps de logis on this floor consists of 4 adjoining rooms connected by a long corridor. Valuable Flemish tapestries can be found in this room. The following tapestries are displayed: * a set of three tapestries depicting virtues and vices as well as biblical figures * a tapestry depicting historical scenes, although, the identity of the persons displayed is not certain. * three matching tapestries containing motifs from the history of Psyche (a character in Amor und Psyche) from the time of the reign of Charles VI of France or Charles VII of France. * a tapestry depicting a room in a palace, where the clothing of the people in the room dates back to the reign of Louis XI. * a tapestry dating back to the beginning of the 16th century which depicts the departure of a hunt.

The game has a simple interface for easy seeding, watering and growing of plants for three different locations. Also the game was programmed so that the growing process could continuously occur even when the computer was off. A French version of the game was also released with the title \\"Le Jardin Enchant√©\\". Gameplay The player does botany in the game first by going from a gardening shop to get some seeds. Some of the plants in the game are entirely fictional, but fun to grow. Each seed type can be planted in an open hole in the ground, then watered with a watering can. The player may choose the time settings for plants to grown from realistic timing (1 day per growing stage) to very fast timing (1 second per growing stage). Plants can also be removed with the trowel tool. There is also a minigame to catch a gopher and avoid the skunk. Finally the player save the garden and create a new one at any time. There three scenes where the player can grow plants. The first scene is a Suburban Home, where flowers can be grown and when fully bloomed can be cut with the shears tool and taken to the Flower Shop to be neatly arranged in a jar. The second scene is a Farming Field, where vegetables and a few flowers can be grown. When the vegetables are ripe they can be harvested and taken to the Market to be weighed and sold. The third scene is a Medieval Castle, where flower rows and bushes can be grown. When the bushes are fully grown, they can be cut into interesting shapes with the shears tool.

His Neo-Confucianist views were influential at court and together with his colleague Wei Liaoweng he was instrumental in making Neo-Confucianism the dominant political philosophy of his time. Life and career Zhen was born in Pucheng (now part of Fujian province). His original family name was Shen (), but was changed to Zhen () owing to the naming taboo of Emperor Xiaozong. He earned his jinshi qualification in 1199. He held a number of court positions, including Prefect of Quanzhou, Vice Minister of Rites, Minister of Revenue and eventually Vice Counsellor. He was also appointed to the Hanlin Academy. During the early part of his political career Zhen enjoyed the patronage of the Prime Minister Han Tuozhou, despite the latter's opposition to the Neo-Confucianist school of thought that Zhen represented (based on political rivalries with the Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi). It was not until Han Tuozhou's death that Zhen started to openly advocate the positions of Zhu Xi. Zhen was widely regarded among his peers as the successor to Zhu Xi's teaching, and was able to overturn the ban on the Cheng-Zhu school implemented during Han's premiership. During the reign of Emperor Lizong, he was known for his uprightness and integrity. Shi Miyuan, then the prime minister, saw Zhen as a potential threat to his political monopoly and removed him from the imperial court. Zhen had not returned to the central government until Shi passed away. During this time, he served as government official in various counties while gaining positive reputation. He died in the year of 1235, several years after his return to the court.History of Song.vol 437. Philosophy Zhen was a student of Zhan Tiren (himself a student of Zhu Xi's school), but adapted Zhan's philosophy to incorporate doctrinal elements of Daoism and Buddhism, modernising it and making it more palatable to the politicians of his day. He also included elements of Lu Jiuyuan's \\"School of the Universal Mind\\", despite the rivalry between this school and Zhu Xi's. As a result, Neo-Confucianism became the primary philosophy of the Song court. His works continued to be influential long after his death; more than a century later, Song Lian was recommending Zhan's work to the Hongwu Emperor, the first of the Ming dynasty, who was so impressed that he had the text of Zhan's Expanded Meaning of the Great Learning copied onto the walls of his palace so he could review it daily. The Sinologist Wm Theodore de Bary regarded Zhen's Heart Mind Classic as the quintessential expression of the Heart-Mind school of Neo-Confucianism, considering it to be Confucian equivalent to the Heart Sutra. In this work, Zhen advocated strict personal discipline and an ascetic lifestyle, focused on personal morality and social reform. He believed that the moral rectification of one's own spirit was the foundation of correct rulership, and felt that it was the duty of the court to encourage the ruler's efforts in personal moral improvement. Zhen's short primer Instructions for Children expounds his view on education, showing that he felt the purpose of education was to replace the wild nature of childhood with the dignity and respectability of adulthood as quickly as possible. Taking the form of a selection of short aphorisms and instructions, it was a popular text in schools for many years, though it fell out of favour after Western pedagogical methods were introduced to China. Zhen also touched on literary criticism with his Writings of the Orthodox School, which addressed literature from a Daoist perspective. Unlike other literary critiques of the time, which classified writings in to as many as 100 categories, Zhen felt that there were only four major categories of literature: instruction, discussion, narration and poetry.

The Army and Air Force equivalents were Superesercito and Superaereo, which were subordinate to Comando Supremo the Supreme Command of the Italian armed forces.  History  The plan to centralise control of naval operations began in November 1934. The Supermarina headquarters at Lungotevere Flaminio in Rome, was completed in 1938 and was inaugurated by Benito Mussolini on 14 October. When the capital was declared an open city, in 1943, Supermarina moved to Santa Rosa on the Via Cassia, about from Rome. The Santa Rosa headquarters remains the seat of Commander in Chief Naval Fleet (CINCNAV). From 10 June 1940 to 8 September 1943, Supermarina supervised all Italian naval operations in the Battle of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the oceans. The head of Supermarina should have been the chief of staff of the Navy, the de facto commander was the deputy chief of staff. At the start of the war, the Chief of Staff of the Navy State was Admiral Domenico Cavagnari and the head of Supermarina was Admiral Odoardo Somigli. On 10 December 1940, Cavagnari was replaced by Admiral Arturo Riccardi and Admiral Inigo Campioni became Deputy Chief of Staff. In July 1941, Admiral Luigi Sansonetti became Deputy Chief of Staff. Supermarina was divided into several sections responsible for functions like decryption, strategic moves and communications. Orders issued by Supermarina to the units and commands were taken in accordance with Comando Supremo. The commander of an Italian battle squadron had little discretion to depart from orders received from Supermarina and when circumstances changed he had to wait for new instructions from Supermarina. This centralisation caused serious problems, when to situations evolved quicker than Supermarina could react. Later in 1940, Supermarina granted commanders more discretion over tactics but maintained strict orders not to engage superior enemy forces, which restrained the initiative of the commanders, to avoid losses that could not be replaced. After 8 September 1943, Supermarina issued orders for the execution of the clauses of the Armistice of Cassibile, the transfer of all seaworthy ships into Allied- controlled ports and the scuttling or sabotage of ships unable to sail, to avoid their capture by the Germans and then ceased operations on 12 September 1943, following the German capture of Rome.

This volcanism is linked to the subduction of the Antarctic Plate beneath the South America Plate and the Scotia Plate. Monte Burney is formed by a caldera with a glaciated stratovolcano on its rim. This stratovolcano in turn has a smaller caldera. An eruption is reported for 1910, with less certain eruptions in 1970 and 1920. Tephra analysis has yielded evidence for many eruptions during the Pleistocene and Holocene, including two large explosive eruptions during the early and mid-Holocene. These eruptions deposited significant tephra layers over Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego.  Name  The volcano is named after James Burney, a companion of James Cook. It is one of the many English language placenames in the region, which are the product of the numerous English research expeditions such as these by Robert FitzRoy and Phillip Parker King in 1825-1830.  Geography and geomorphology  Monte Burney is on the northwest Mu√±oz Gomera Peninsula. This area lies in the Patagonian region of Chile, which is known for its spectacular fjords. The volcano lies in the commune of Natales northwest of Punta Arenas, and approximately southwest of Puerto Natales. The area is unpopulated and remote.  Regional  The Andes feature about four areas of volcanic activity from north to south: the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone, the Southern Volcanic Zone and the Austral Volcanic Zone. Aside from the main belt, so-called \\"back-arc\\" volcanism occurs as far as behind the volcanic arc. These volcanic zones are separated by gaps lacking volcanic activity. Volcanism in the region occurs because of the Southern Volcanic Zone and the Austral Volcanic Zone. These contain about 74 volcanoes with post- glacial activity; they include both monogenetic volcanoes, stratovolcanoes and volcanic complexes. Llaima and Villarrica are among the most active of these volcanoes. The Southern and Austral volcanic zones are separated by a gap without volcanic activity, close to the Chile Triple Junction. The strongest volcanic eruption in the region occurred 7,750 years before present at Cerro Hudson volcano, which deposited tephra all over southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. This eruption probably caused a major depopulation of Tierra del Fuego, the temporary disappearance of long-range obsidian trade, and a change in the prevalent lifestyles of the region.  Local  Monte Burney seen from space Monte Burney is the most southern stratovolcano of the Austral Volcanic Zone. Six Quaternary volcanoes form this long volcanic arc. The Antarctic Plate subducts beneath the South America Plate and the Scotia Plate at a pace of about , causing the volcanism. The young age of the subducting crust (12-24 million years old) gives the volcanic rocks a unique chemical composition including adakitic rocks. The movement between the South America Plate and the Scotia Plate is taken up by strike-slip faulting. In terms of composition, Lautaro, Aguilera and Viedma form one group distinct from Burney, and Reclus lies between these two. southeast of Monte Burney lies Fueguino, a volcanic field with possible historical activity in 1820 and 1712. Fueguino is the southernmost Holocene volcano in the Andes. Large explosive eruptions have occurred at Aguilera, Reclus and Burney but due to the long distance between these volcanoes and critical infrastructure they are considered a low hazard. A wide caldera lies in the area, which is partly filled by pyroclastic flows. Some of these flows extend outside the caldera. On the western rim of the caldera, the high Monte Burney volcano developed. It has its own summit caldera, and a steep wall on the northern side with uncertain origin. This volcano is glaciated, with a glacier extending between of altitude. The total glacier volume is about and there might be rock glaciers as well. The volcano also shows traces of a sector collapse towards the south-southwest. Flank vents are also found and generated lava and pyroclastic flows. The rim of the larger caldera is taken up by a ring of lava domes. Glacial erosion has left a rugged landscape, which close to the volcano is smoothed by deposits coming from the volcano. The landscape east of the caldera is buried by pyroclastic flows, and some outcrops in them may be remnants of a pre-Burney volcano.  Composition  The flank vents have erupted andesite and dacite, belonging to a potassium-poor calcalkaline series. Such a limited range of composition is typical for these volcanoes but might reflect the small amount of research conducted on them. Tephras of rhyolitic composition were generated by Monte Burney during the Pleistocene, according to compositional data. Holocene eruptions have near-identical composition. Minerals found in Burney rocks include amphibole, plagioclase and pyroxene; foreign components include clinopyroxene and olivine crystals as well as granite xenoliths stemming from the Patagonian batholith. Magnesium-poor adakites have been found at Monte Burney. Fueguino volcanic rocks also include adakites but these are richer in magnesium. These adakitic magmas reflect the subduction of a relatively hot and young Antarctic Plate. In the case of Monte Burney, these magmas then underwent some fractionation during ascent, as it was retarded by the tectonic regimen, which is somewhat compressive.  Climate  The climate of the Patagonian region is influenced both by the close distance to Antarctica and by the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies. Polar cold air outbreaks, cool ocean upwelling, orographic precipitation and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current further affect the regional climate. About four stages of glaciation have been recognized in the area during the Pleistocene, although the glacial history is poorly known. Monte Burney was glaciated during the last glacial maximum. During the early Holocene, glaciers retreated quickly then slowed down during the Antarctic Cold Reversal. A slight expansion is noted during the Little Ice Age.  Eruptive history  Eruptions occurred at Monte Burney during the Pleistocene. Two eruptions around 49,000 ¬± 500 and 48,000 ¬± 500 years before present deposited tephra in Laguna Potrok Aike, a lake approximately east of Monte Burney; there they reach thicknesses of and respectively. Other Pleistocene eruptions are recorded there at 26,200 and 31,000 years ago, with additional eruptions having occurred during marine isotope stage 3. Holocene tephras from Monte Burney have also been found in this lake. Radiocarbon dating and tephrochronology has evidenced Holocene activity at Burney. 2,320 ¬± 100 and 7,450 ¬± 500 BCE large Plinian eruptions with a volcanic explosivity index of 5 generated the MB2 and MB1 tephras, respectively. These tephras have volumes exceeding for MB1 and for MB2. The MB2 eruption may have formed the summit caldera as well as tephra deposits exceeding of thickness east of the volcano. It probably reached Antarctica as well, as tephra layers in the Talos ice core in East Antarctica show a tephra layer of approximately the same age and composition to MB2. Soil acidification from tephras of the MB2 eruption lasted for millennia after the eruption on the basis of stalagmite data, and lake and peat sediments indicate that this soil acidification caused a decay of the Nothofagus vegetation in the area of Seno Skyring. Vegetation changes at Lago Lynch may have also been caused by the Burney eruption but there climate change is considered to be a more likely driver. A sulfate spike in an Antarctic ice core around 4,100 ¬± 100 years before present may have been caused by MB2. The MB2 ash spread in a southeasterly direction in comparison to the easterly MB1 ash. These ashes have also been found at Lake Arturo, the first discovery of them in the Argentine Tierra del Fuego. Further findings were made at Ushuaia, Brunswick Peninsula, and a number of other sites. Tephras from Monte Burney and other volcanoes are important for tephrostratigraphy in the region of the Andes. The date of the MB2 eruption is also given as 4,260 years before present. Other dates are 8,425 ¬± 500 years before present for MB1 and 3,830 ¬± 390 or 3,820 ¬± 390 for MB2, both by radiocarbon dating. Further eruptions occurred 90 ¬± 100, 800 ¬± 500, 3,740 ¬± 10, 7,390 ¬± 200 BCE, and 1,529 ¬± 28, 1,944 ¬± 29, 10,015 and 1,735 years before present. The last two were small eruptions. Tephra from an eruption that occurred about 2,000 years before present reached a thickness of in a peat bog away from Monte Burney. One tephra around 1805 BCE found at the Siple Dome in Antarctica may be linked to Monte Burney but the timing of the tephra is problematic. Two tephras at Fiordo Vogel and Seno Skyring have been linked to Monte Burney; they are dated 4,254 ¬± 120 and 9,009 ¬± 17 - 9,175 ¬± 111 years before present. The younger of these two eruptions influenced sedimentation in these water bodies and the adjacent vegetation. Reports from natives, mentioned in 1847, of a volcano at the end of a bay that makes the ground tremble probably refer to Monte Burney, which is visible on clear days from . In 1910 a researcher concluded that the volcano had been active in postglacial time, given that pumice formations found around the volcano would not have survived glaciation. Only one historical eruption is known from Burney, which occurred in 1910. This eruption has a volcanic explosivity index of 2, and was observed by a merchant ship. This eruption appeared to coincide with an earthquake and tsunami on 24 June 1910 in the area. An unconfirmed report of an eruption in 1920 exists, as well as reports of a flash of light and earthquakes during the night of 24 June 1970. No reports of such activity were identified in the contemporaneous newspaper ', however. Shallow seismic activity occurs to this day at Monte Burney.  Research history  The mountain was already known before 1871; a book written in that year by Robert Oliver Cunningham records the following travel report mentioning Monte Burney: The appearance of the mountain was considered \\"majestic\\" in 1899. Eric Shipton explored the area in 1962, and after a failed attempt in 1963 climbed Monte Burney on the 10th of March 1973, reaching its summit together with Peter Radcliffe and Roger Perry. Auer in 1974 did correlate some tephras on Tierra del Fuego with Monte Burney, one of which was later linked to Reclus. In 2015 the Chilean geological agency SERNAGEOMIN began setting up volcano monitoring equipment on Monte Burney, the first volcano in the Magallanes Patagonia region to be monitored.

The most common side effects are dyskinesia (difficulty controlling movement), constipation, increased blood creatine kinase, hypotension/syncope, and decreased weight. Opicapone, works to restore the levels of dopamine in the parts of the brain that control movement and coordination. It enhances the effects of levodopa, a copy of the neurotransmitter dopamine that can be taken by mouth. Opicapone blocks an enzyme that is involved in the breakdown of levodopa in the body called catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). As a result, levodopa remains active for longer. This helps to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as stiffness and slowness of movement. In June 2016, it was authorised for use in the European Union. It was authorised for use in the United States in April 2020. Medical uses In the EU, opicapone is indicated as adjunctive therapy to preparations of levodopa/ DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors (DDCI) in adults with Parkinson's disease and end-of- dose motor fluctuations who cannot be stabilised on those combinations. In the US, opicapone is indicated as adjunctive treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experiencing \\"off\\" episodes. The COMT inhibitor opicapone is used as an additive to a combination of levodopa and a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor to treat patients with Parkinson's disease experiencing end-of-dose motor fluctuations, if they cannot be stabilised with this drug combination. Contraindications This drug is contraindicated in people with cancers that secrete catecholamines (for example epinephrine), such as phaeochromocytoma or paraganglioma, because as a COMT inhibitor it blocks catecholamine degradation. Other contraindications are a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis, and combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors that are not used as antiparkinsonians, because of possible drug interactions. NMS and associated rhabdomyolysis have been rarely observed under the older COMT inhibitors tolcapone and entacapone. This typically occurs shortly after the beginning of a COMT inhibitor add-on therapy when the levodopa dose has been reduced, or after discontinuation of a COMT inhibitor. Opicapone is contraindicated in people with concomitant use of non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or people with pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, or other catecholamine secreting neoplasms. Side effects People taking opicapone very commonly (18%) experience dyskinesia. Other common side effects (in 1 to 10% of patients) include dizziness, strange dreams, hallucinations, constipation, dry mouth, orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure), and muscle spasms. Apart from spasms, these side effects are also known from tolcapone and entacapone. As with entacapone, no relevant liver toxicity has been found in studies. This is in contrast to the first COMT inhibitor tolcapone, which could cause ‚Äì in some cases lethal ‚Äì liver insufficiency. Overdose No specific antidote is known.  Interactions  Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) are another class of drugs blocking catecholamine degradation. Therefore, their combination with opicapone can result in increased catecholamine concentrations in the body and corresponding adverse effects. Combining the antiparkinson MAO inhibitors selegiline or rasagiline with opicapone is considered safe. Potentially, there are also interactions with drugs being metabolised by COMT (for example isoprenaline, epinephrine, dopamine, or dobutamine), tricyclic antidepressants and antidepressants of the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor type. Possible pharmacokinetic interactions are with substrates of the liver enzyme CYP2C8, such as repaglinide, and the transporter protein SLCO1B1, such as simvastatin. Pharmacology Mechanism of action Opicapone blocks the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) effectively (>90% at therapeutic doses), selectively and reversibly, and only outside the central nervous system. It dissociates slowly from COMT, resulting in a duration of action longer than 24 hours despite its short blood plasma half-life. As COMT and DOPA decarboxylase are the main enzymes for degrading levodopa, blocking the two effectively increases its concentrations in the bloodstream. More levodopa reaches the brain, where it is activated to dopamine. Pharmacokinetics reduced derivative (BIA 9-1079), and the inactive glucuronide (BIA 9-1106). The substance is quickly absorbed from the gut, but only to about 20% of the applied dose. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after 1 to 2.5 hours. When in the bloodstream, it is almost completely (99.9%) bound to plasma proteins, but apparently to different binding sites than warfarin, digoxin and other drugs with high plasma protein affinity. It is mainly metabolised to the sulfate, which accounts for 67% of the circulating drug after a single dose, and a methylated derivative, which accounts for 21%. Minor metabolites are a reduced derivative (<10%) and a glucuronide. All of these metabolites are inactive except the reduced derivative. Opicapone is eliminated with a terminal half-life of 0.7 to 3.2 hours. It is mainly excreted via the faeces (67%), and in form of the glucuronide also via the kidney (13%). The sulfate has a much longer half-life of 94 to 122 hours. Opicapone sulfate is transported by SLCO1B1; the possibility that it blocks this transporter has not been excluded. Opicapone itself and the sulfate are also transported by a number of other proteins, but given the low concentrations of the free substances in the blood plasma, this is very unlikely to give rise to drug interactions. Opicapone is a weak inhibitor of the liver enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9. The only CYP interaction found in studies that is somewhat likely to be relevant is that with repaglinide, which is metabolised by CYP2C8. The metabolism of warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, is not measurably affected. History Opicapone was authorised for medical use in the European Union in June 2016. In February 2017, its developer Bial sold exclusive marketing rights for the United States and Canada to Neurocrine Biosciences for an initial payment of . Opicapone was authorised for medical use in the United States in April 2020. Opicapone was approved based on evidence from two clinical trials (Trial 1/ NCT01568073, and Trial 2/NCT01227655) of 522 participants with Parkinson's disease (PD) whose symptoms were not well controlled while receiving their regular PD treatment. Trial 1 was conducted at 104 sites in 19 European countries, and Trial 2 was conducted at 69 sites in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, Czech Republic, Estonia, India, Israel, South Korea, Russia, South Africa and UK. There were two 12-week trials conducted in Parkinson's disease (PD) participants with inadequate control of their Parkinson's symptom (\\"off\\" time) while receiving carbidopa/levodopa PD medications. Participants were randomly selected to receive either opicapone or a placebo capsule once a day. Neither the participants nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given until the trial was completed. In all of the trials, the participants kept daily diaries of the number of hours of \\"off\\" time for the three days before the evaluation visit. The benefit was evaluated by measuring the change from baseline in total daily \\"off\\" time in opicapone- and placebo-receiving participants.

It is located in the district of Amadiya and the historical region of Barwari. The village is mostly inhabited by Assyrians. In the village, there are churches of Mar Sawa and Mart Shmuni. Etymology The Syriac and Kurdish names of the village, Ain Nuni and Kani Masi, respectively, both translate to \\"spring of fish\\". Ain Nuni is derived from \\"ain\\" (\\"spring\\" in Syriac) and \\"nuni\\" (\\"fish\\" in Syriac), whilst Kani Masi is a combination of \\"kani\\" (\\"spring\\" in Kurdish) and \\"masi\\" (\\"fish\\" in Kurdish). History Clay vessels dated to between 1415 and 1290 B.C were discovered during an archaeological survey in the area of Ain Nuni. The church of Mar Sawa was constructed in the 10th century, and underwent restorations in 1742. In 1850, 20 Nestorian families inhabited Ain Nuni, and were served by one functioning church and one priest as part of the diocese of Berwari. Prior to the First World War, Ain Nuni was inhabited by approximately 350 Assyrians. The village was ransacked by Ottoman Turkish and Kurdish forces in the spring of 1915, amidst the Assyrian genocide, but the villagers survived by fleeing under the leadership of Agha Petros to the vicinity of Urmia in Iran. In the winter of 1915-1916, whilst in Iran, 120 villagers died, c. 20 were killed, and 10 women were abducted. The villagers eventually returned after seven years. A school was constructed in 1928, and the village became the centre of a sub-district in 1934. 70 families populated Ain Nuni in 1938. Ain Nuni was inhabited by 420 Assyrians in 1957. At the onset of the First Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War in 1961, Kurdish rebels led by Mustafa Barzani attacked the village and killed a bishop, two priests, and over 15 men. Assyrians from nearby villages repelled the Kurds, and the surviving villagers took refuge in larger towns, and returned at the war's end in 1970. KDP forces seized Ain Nuni from Iraqi National Defence Battalions in September 1987 during the Iran-Iraq War and occupied it for six days. On 27 February 1988, the village was destroyed and its population of 180 Assyrian families was forcibly evacuated by the Iraqi government during the Al-Anfal campaign. 20 families returned after the establishment of the Iraqi no-fly zones in the aftermath of the 1991 uprisings in Iraq, however, in the following year it was reported that Kurds from neighbouring villages had illegally seized 5000 m2 from the villagers of Ain Nuni. The Turkish Armed Forces established a military base close to Ain Nuni in 1996 as part of the Kurdish-Turkish conflict. The Kurdistan Regional Government illegally confiscated 30,000 m2 from an Assyrian in the village in 2003 to construct an office for the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), and the village was given the name Kani Masi as part of its policy of Kurdification. In early 2009, 23 displaced Assyrians, with 9 families, resided at Ain Nuni. The Supreme Committee of Christian Affairs constructed 58 houses, a church, and hall, and provided two electrical generators by 2011. It was reported that the church of Mar Sawa, built by the Supreme Committee of Christian Affairs, had been poorly constructed and its fa√ßade was at risk of collapsing. In 2012, the village was inhabited by 500 adherents of the Assyrian Church of the East. Ain Nuni was struck by Turkish airstrikes on 5 September 2018. Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militants clashed with the Turkish army near Ain Nuni on 12 December 2018. The village was shelled by Turkish artillery on 19 March 2019, and resulted in damage to three houses. Militants attacked the Turkish military base near the village on 19 March 2020, killing six Turkish soldiers, and injuring four others.

Biography  The ensemble was founded in 2002 by Jay Bernfeld, viola da gamba, and Patricia Lavail, recorder. Its name refers to the rebirth of the Phoenix and illustrates the ensemble‚Äôs desire to revive forgotten scores, often in original juxtapositions. Fuoco E Cenere is singled out by its repertoire ranging from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 20th century. More than a thousand years of music that have been recorded on 10 discs. The ensemble appears in various forms, both instrumental and vocal, ranging from 2 to 10 artists. The adventure began in 2002 with \\"Fantasy in Blue\\", a program featuring works by Purcell and Gershwin, with mezzo-soprano Rinat Shaham. The CD was hailed by Le Monde as \\"a real knockout\\". Petrarch‚Äôs 700th birthday (2004) was marked by a tribute program with Guillemette Laurens. In 2006, Canta Napoli was a journey through 400 years of Neapolitan songs and its great singers. In 2007, Fuoco E Cenere‚Äôs interpretation of Marco da Gagliano‚Äôs La Dafne was awarded an Orph√©e d'Or by the Acad√©mie du Disque Lyrique. The ensemble first theatrical endeavor Je Suis Ton Labyrinthe was staged by David Lippe in 2008, during a residence at the International Institute of Puppetry of Charleville-M√©zi√®res. A mix of live music and object theater, the production starred Isabelle Poulenard and Guillemette Laurens and was recorded on the Arion label as Umana e Inumana. Pulcinella was created in 2009 in collaboration with the Neapolitan puppeteer master Bruno Leone, and allowed the music of Pergolese to meet the art of burattinaio. This program was presented at the International Museum of Puppetry in Sicily and at the Cit√© de la Musique in Paris. Compl√®tement Toqu√© was created in 2013 during a residence at the Th√©√¢tre de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines and has been performed more than 35 times in Europe and North America. This musico-culinary fantasy staged by V√©ronique Samakh was conceived as a nod to the recognition of the culinary and gastronomic know-how of France, raised to the rank of World Heritage by Unesco. The CD Judith & Esther, divine destinies (2014) highlights the universal stories of two biblical heroines. The concert performances benefit from the on stage participation of illustrator Fred Bayle. In 2015, Fuoco E Cenere began a collaboration with Canal + for its original creation, the TV series Versailles, featuring the ensemble‚Äôs musicians both on screen and on the soundtrack for the three seasons. This collaboration inspired a program of the same name, reflecting the omnipresence of music at the Court of Louis XIV. In 2017, Jay Bernfeld paid tribute to a comrade of four decades with a CD covering 25 years in the life of Marin Marais. Fuoco E Cenere performs both in France and internationally with appearances under the auspices of Early Music Vancouver, Froville Festival, Montreal Baroque Festival, Music at St Paul's in Delray, Festival Via Stellae, La Dame des Aulnes, Music and Beyond in Ottawa, Montansier Theater in Versailles, Riches Musicales de la Rotonde, Musik + in Austria, Festival Midis Minimes in Belgium, St Michel en Thi√©rache Festival, Reims Opera, Folles Journ√©es de Nantes... and others.

Biography  Youth and formative years  Jacques Martin was born on 24 June 1906 in Sainte-Colombe, Rh√¥ne where his father was teaching. His grandfather was a methodist minister. From 1923 to 1927, he studied at the Protestant Faculty of Theology in Paris.Page on Jacques Martin on the \\"Anonymes, Justes et Pers√©cut√©s durant la p√©riode Nazie dans les communes de France\\" website, last accessed on 12 September 2016 There he became friends with Andr√© Trocm√©, who was a few years older than him. He also met another student, Henri Roser, whose militant pacifist and internationalist ideas shook French Protestant society of that time. Jacques Martin then became a pacifist himself, and wished to contribute personally to international reconciliation, starting with France and Germany. He crisscrossed Germany walking through the 1925 summer. As a member of the French branch of the World Student Christian Federation (WSCF, which is casually referred to as the ‚ÄúF√©d√©‚Äù), he took part in the 1926 German gathering of the WSCF. The same year he took charge of the editing of ‚ÄúCahiers de la R√©conciliation ¬ª (at the time a simple information bulletin which would be taken over and developed by Henri Roser from November 1927 on). In 1927, he took part in an \\"international reconciliation youth camp\\" in Vaumarcus, Switzerland, studied one semester in Berlin in 1929, where he got in touch with German pacifist Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze. In 1930, he welcomed Gandhi in Paris. From 1930 to 1932 he was the secretary of the WSCF.  Conscientious objector  In spite of his pacifist convictions, Jacques Martin performed military service in 1927-1928 - out of care for his father who had just been shaken by the loss of two sons. However, in December 1930, he returned his military papers, specifying that, as a Christian, he could not bear arms. In 1932, he refused to take part in a training session of the military reserve force and he was consequently arrested, tried and condemned to 12 months in prison on 11 October 1932. On 23 janvier 1934, Jacques Martin married Jacqueline √âli√© in Al√®s. In the summer of 1934, the young couple was expecting its first child when a new call-in letter arrived for a new follow- up military training, which he again refused to attend. He is arrested in the midst of the ‚ÄúF√©d√©‚Äù‚Äôs summer camp, and condemned to another 18 months in prison in February 1935. He was released in January 1936 and again briefly imprisoned in 1937, 1938 and 1939. His only companions on this harsh road of conscience objection were at this stage a protestant theology student, Philippe Vernier and a protestant primary school teacher Camille Rombault.Jean-Paul Cahn, Fran√ßoise Knopper, Anne-Marie Saint-Gille, De la Guerre juste √† la paix juste: Aspects confessionnels de la construction de la paix dans l'espace franco-allemand (XVIe-XXe si√®cle), Collection Histoire et civilisations, Presses Universitaires Septentrion, 2008, 313 pages, , p.168 His failing health ensured his definitive exemption from military service before the start of WWII. Jacques Martin turned each of his trials into a platform to advertise for conscience objection. His defence counsel was solicitor and socialist MP Andr√© Philip, who called upon leading intellectuals like Jean Gu√©henno or Marc Sangnier and upon representatives of the French Human Rights League. As early as 1928, Martin had temporarily given up on his career in church ministry because of the staunch opposition of institutional protestantism towards his pacifist and anti-militaristic positions. In 1938, still unable to become a pastor, he accepted a position of administrative and human resources director in a silk stockings manufacturing plant in Ganges, H√©rault.  War years  In the wake of the first Vichy anti-Jewish legislation by Marshall P√©tain‚Äôs government on 3 October 1940, Jacques Martin decided jointly with Ganges‚Äô pastor √âlie Gounelle to call for a regional meeting of all Protestant pastors in the area, in order to pray and reflect on the new situation, including the apparent support apparently extended to the Vichy government by the church authorities ‚Äì including, at that early stage, by the president of the Protestant Federation of France, pastor Marc Boegner. According to Jacques Martin's own account, the day was ‚Äúdedicated to the problem of anti-Semitism or rather to anti-Semitism and the Bible‚Äù. A second such meeting, in November 1942, would be organised to respond to the new situation created by the roundups of 26 August 1942 in the southern zone of France. In both of these meetings, Jacques Martin shared a very well-informed and accurate documentation which allowed pastors to prepare themselves for resistance to the anti-Semitic policy of the Vichy regime. At the same time, the Martins had joined the CIMADE in close cooperation with Madeleine Barot. They intervened in several ways: supplying packages with food or warm clothes for the Gurs internment camp internees, sheltering fleeing Jews and routing them towards safe caches or appropriate underground escape routes, forging identity cards and ration tickets for the hidden Jews. They also hid Jacques‚Äô brother-in-law, pastor Andr√© Trocm√© when he had to go underground in their family house in Dr√¥me. On 22 June 1944, Jacques Martin was reported to the police by his direct neighbour. He was arrested by the Milice and detained in Montpellier‚Äôs prison. Strangely, the local Resistance managed to negotiate his release in exchange for a flock of 1,000 sheep. He was freed three days before the liberation of his area. During the war years he became friends with historian Jules Isaac who had sought refuge in Ganges.  Lay and clerical ministries  After the war, Jacques Martin was back in touch with the ¬´ Social Christians ¬ª, a mainly protestant movement seeking to join together evangelism and care for the poorer classes of society; after meeting with √âlie Gounelle at ‚ÄúMus√©e Social ‚Äú (a Parisian think tank), he prepared the relaunching of the movement and of its magazine, the ‚ÄúRevue du Christianisme Social‚Äù. He also organised the 25th Christian Social Congress in Paris. In 1948, he participated in the creation of the French branch of the International Council of Christians and Jews, called les Amiti√©s jud√©o- chr√©tiennes (A.J.C. - Jewish Christian Friendships) whose first president was catholic theologian Henri-Ir√©n√©e Marrou, while Jacques Martin was both the first vice-president and the AJC bulletin's editor. While continuing with its commitments with the CIMADE, A.J.C., and Social Christians, Jacques Martin still didn't apply to become a pastor although the institutional opposition had then faded away. (Henri Roser was for instance now in charge of a parish.) He preferred to experience the position of a \\"committed layman\\". From 1947 to 1950, he ran a bookshop in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon where he also taught Latin at the Coll√®ge C√©venol, then from 1950 to 1966 he ran another bookshop in Lyon. On 29 March 1966, he welcomed Martin Luther King Jr. on his visit in Lyon. Finally he felt the need to \\"bind the sheaf\\" and was ordained on 9 January 1966 by the French Reformed Church (after a last hesitation from the institution, as the candidate is already 60!) and took a position with the Geneva state church. He is put in charge of the creation of a new parish in a newly built area of the greater Geneva. This parish is now known as the Centre Communautaire Protestant du Lignon. Having retired in 1973, he still performed pastoral tasks in Mens from 1973 to 1977, and finally took full retirement in the area of Die, still acting as a substitute pastor in case of vacancies). He died in Die on 23 July 2001. His wife had died 5 years earlier on 30 September 1996. They had had six children: Andr√© (1934-1934), Violaine (born 1937), Daniel (born 1937), Amy-Christiane (1939-1945), Jean-Marc (born 1941) et Ariane (born 1950). Distinctions After WWII, he was awarded the Croix de guerre in tribute to his fight \\"to help Compulsory Work Service dodgers, les r√©fractaires, les maquisards and all victims of enemy repression.\\"! On 22 June 1998, Yad Vashem awarded the recognition of ¬´ Righteous Among the Nations¬ª both to pastor Jacques Martin and to his wife Jacqueline.  Contribution and legacy   Clear-sightedness over Nazism and anti-Semitism  Probably unique among pacifists, Jacques Martin was \\"one of the very few\\" who rejected the \\"hopes of a nebulous French-German reconciliation\\" stemming from the Munich agreement and who therefore were immediately \\"in Resistance\\", according to Jacques Martin's own words in 1938: \\"I remain more than ever non-violent. But I do not harbour any confusion between non-violence and non-resistance. Non-violence means placing resistance on another level than the test of military forces. This resistance is necessary‚Ä¶ ¬ª.Letter from Jacques Martin to his father-in-law, 26 October 1938, Violaine Kichenin-Martin Archives, quoted by Patrick Cabanel, op.cit.\\" In a context where justifications of anti- Semitism abound, sometimes even from protestants, Jacques Martin published in August 1939 an article entitled ¬´ Pagan ... and Christian anti-Semitism‚Äù (L‚ÄôAntis√©mitisme pa√Øen... et chr√©tien). In its first part, the article gives a detailed list, country by country, of anti-Semitic persecutions in Europe, while the second part deals with the Christians‚Äô attitude and sometimes responsibility. Referring to the traditional Christian accusation of Jewish deicide, he asks : ¬´ Who does not reject Christ ? Does Christianity not bear the same responsibility than the Jews for the crucifixion of its Master ? Is our own so-called Christian civilisation not bearing more witness of a deeper and more serious rejection and blasphemy than the shouts of a versatile crowd or the calculations of a sanhedrin lost in its clericalism and its pride? ¬ª.Article by Jacques Martin in Revue du Christianisme Social, August 1939, p. 128.  Preparation for anti-Nazi resistance With their two pastoral meeting held in Ganges, Jacques Martin and Elie Gounelle prepared their colleagues to exert solidarity towards the persecuted Jews. ¬´ We had gathered all the pastors of this area of the Cevennes to study this question. These were necessary preliminaries. Caring for the Jews didn‚Äôt happen spontaneously, not even from the camisards‚Äô memory ! A long preparation phase, a reflection were needed first, often in opposition with certain Protestant theological concepts, where Judaism was regarded as a mere preamble to Christianity, whereas there was a real spiritual problem, alongside a humanitarian situation from 1942 onwards ¬ª.Autobiographical text by Jacques Martin, read during the Valleraugue seminar in 1984, quoted by Philippe Joutard, Jacques Poujol & Patrick Cabanel (dir.), C√©vennes, terre de refuge, 4e √©d., 2006 [1987], pp. 239-240. For these meetings, Jacques Martin had gathered very significant documentation, first on the events on the ground which he had ample information about through the Cimade network and through other pastors operating on the ground like Henri Manen, then on the Vichy anti-Semitic laws through articles found in the Swiss Protestant Press and in internal French Protestant churches texts, like the Pomeyrol theses.The Pomeyrol theses were a text written on 16 and 17 September 1941 by twelve members of the Reformed Church of France (ERF), in order to provide theological support for resistance to Nazism, against the spirit of collaboration and defeatism, by calling for spiritual resistance. The text took particular exception of the anti-semitic legislation passed by the Vichy regime, as the Barmen Declaration had done before them. The meeting took place on the premises of the newly established Pomeyrol Community, near Beaucaire in the southern Rh√¥ne valley.  Forerunner of conscientious objection in France  With a few of his fellow Protestant theology students, Jacques Martin was a pionnier of pacifism in France ; in 1923, he was the first editor of the review of Mouvement international de la r√©conciliation (MIR), the French branch of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation.Majagira Bulangalire, Le mouvement international de la r√©conciliation et le probl√®me du pacifisme dans le protestantisme fran√ßais de l'entre-deux-guerres (avec un aper√ßu jusqu'√† 1960) . In: √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes, Section des sciences religieuses. Annuaire. Tome 97, 1988-1989. 1988. pp. 491-493. At his two trials, Jacques Martin was defended by solicitor Andr√© Philip, who also defended Camille Rombault and Philippe Vernier. All these trials for draft dodging made big headlines in 1932 and 1933. Andr√© Philip used them as platforms for conscientious objectors, developing his arguments further at each trial. He called upon pastors such as Marc Boegner, Henri Nick, Andr√© Trocm√© and Charles Westphal and leading intellectuals such as Marc Sangnier, Jean Guehenno and Julien Benda. These trials were a wake-up call for French society and foremost for the French Protestants who not only became more visible on the national scene at this occasion but whose internal opinion was also shifted at the same time. In 1948, the French Reformed Church officially adopted the position that conscientious objection was legitimate and requested the State to grant a legal status to conscientious objectors; the French Catholic Church will wait until 1965 to take the same position.Guy Durand, La D√©sob√©issance civile et nous; √† l'√©cole de Gandhi et Luther King.

Education Expelled from school, he later achieved various qualifications required by the RAF (Royal Air Force), and studied MBA to certificate.  Career  After thirty three years of Royal Air Force service he left as an Engineering Officer. He worked on Nimrod, Tornado jets and lastly as the Chief Engineer on Sea King Search and Rescue helicopters. Between engineering jobs he was the Staff Officer RAF Mountain Rescue Service in charge of teams in Scotland. In this position he took the first RAF team to climb Mt. Everest in 2001. This was a success and the first summit of Everest by an RAF team. Ted, who has always been an outdoors person, joined the RAF Mountain Rescue Service as a volunteer in 1979 as a ‚ÄòTroop‚Äô, and served on several teams before Everest. During Mountain Rescue service he led the first RAF team to climb the North Face of the Eiger. He spent a year exploring in Antarctica where he was a mountain leader, surveyor and cartographer making maps of places no one had ever seen. He made 28 first ascents of mountains there. That was then followed by a period of service with the Royal Navy on HMS Endurance, principally as a marine engineer but also serving with the Royal Marines as their Mountain Leader. In this role he was awarded his coveted ‚ÄòGreen Beret‚Äô for work with the Marines on an Antarctic rescue mission where he led one of the two detachments. For his Antarctic work, he was invested with the Polar Medal by HM The Queen. His last job with the Service was attached to the SAS as the Project Officer for a 100% successful ascent of Everest. He has maintained a 44-year link of service to his old Air Training Corps squadron 2425 in Nottinghamshire throughout and served as a reservist. In his early career Ted was a boxer and was an RAF champion. Mountaineering in all of its forms was always a part of his life. Ted was an avid rock climber, later in Scotland discovering what would become his passion till he died, winter climbing. He was a BASI and Joint Service ski instructor in Alpine and Nordic disciplines and a hang glider pilot.  Mountain Resume From rock and winter climbing Ted went to the Alps and onto the Himalayas, first in 1983 to Manaslu then onto the West Ridge of Everest in 1988. This is where he became involved with oxygen systems. This expedition was unsuccessful on a number of fronts but did sow the seed for the RAF Everest Expedition in 2001. In 1987 he was the Climbing Leader on the phenomenally successful Gimaghella expedition led by Marine Maj. Pat Parsons. This was a new route and first British ascent in good style. Ted did not summit with the RAF Everest team because one of the team members got sick on the summit push. Ted and his partner Dr. Brian Kirkpatrick lost their summit making the rescue. He went back to Everest, this time to the south in Nepal in 2004 to climb the mountain on his own. Using his engineering head he deduced that the greatest aid to staying alive, keeping all fingers and toes, and success was to have a good oxygen delivery system. This was not available so he set out to invent one. This he did one day prior to setting off for the summit. The prototype had a condom inside a Coca-Cola bottle as the core component. People said he would die. One of his cylinders went missing on the mountain. He was left for dead on the summit but was saved by Mingma Sherpa and Andrew Lock. However the speed of his ascent had been noted by other climbers and he was asked by Jagged Globe to make commercial systems (without string or condoms was the condition). One year later and this system became the industry standard.  Post RAF Ted set up business in Nepal and continued to develop and improve the oxygen systems used on Mt Everest and other high mountains. At this time it was considered that 1:10 people attempting Everest would die trying. Some years later he got a letter from the Nepalese Mountaineering Association thanking him for reducing the death rate from 1:10 to less than 1:700 (no typo). The Topout (Topout, to succeed, to summit a mountain or route) system was firmly established. The demand was such that Ted had to leave the Service early to concentrate on this new business. He went onto produce a new cylinder, cylinder valve, regulator and flow controller. Lastly he has built a plant to produce oxygen in Nepal in order to guarantee the quality of the gas that Topout supplies. A request to work with the Everest Skydive Team was taken up to give them a better oxygen system for jumps exiting the aircraft level with the summit of Everest. This was an outstanding success. The Topout Aero skydive system went on to become the industry standard some years ago and a number of world records have been set. This continues to evolve and now in the Military guise is MTOS, Military Tactical Oxygen System. As part of this new work Ted trained as a skydiver and earned one world record. He worked with Red Bull on the Mt Blanc project. Ted was a Science and Engineering Ambassador with a remit to stimulate and encourage (mainly) young people into science and engineering. He was an acclaimed public and motivational speaker. He has delivered talks in: UK, USA, Nepal, France and Italy where he lived in the Dolomites. In Nepal he was involved with several charity organizations inc: Duke of Edinburgh and was a trustee of an orphanage. He wrote a column in Nepal called Outside In where he told of the visitors' views of Nepal with the aim of making things better. He spoke to, and worked with the industry in Nepal and tried to influence events.  Mountains Continuing work on the evolution of various mountaineering oxygen systems has required big mountains to be climbed. Since Everest in 2004, Ted climbed: Makalu, Kangchenjunga, Lhotse, Lobuche East, and Ama Dablam. Ama Dablam was unique in that he parachuted into the Base Camp setting a world record then went onto climb the mountain. He was an avid skier on his home turf in Italy and a passionate mountaineer especially for winter climbing. He died descending Monte Civetta, one of the highest mountains of the Dolomites in the province of Belluno (Italy), on 20 August 2018.

The village is west of the town of Keighley and north of Oakworth village. The village is in the council ward of Keighley West. History Laycock is mentioned in the Domesday Book as having two Carucates of land and was originally part of the Oakworth township, before becoming part of Keighley in the 13th century. The name Laycock is the same as Lacock, which derives from the Old English meaning, stream or watercourse; Laycock village is on Laycock Beck, which feeds into North Beck a tributary of the River Worth. The village is the setting for William Sharp (also known as Old Three Laps) who was jilted by his bride in 1807. He apparently took to his bed in Whorles Farm near to Laycock for the rest of his life, which ended 49 years later in 1856. One local historian said that Sharp was a victim of an age when mental illness and its treatment was not well understood. In his book Through Airedale from Goole to Malham, Speight mentions that Laycock is one of the handful of locations throughout Airedale where the village had a Maypole. The rite of dancing around the Maypole was rescinded in an act put through Parliament by Charles I in 1644, where it was labeled as \\"a heathenish vanity.\\" Laycock overlooks the hamlet of Goose Eye, which is just south of the village. Goose Eye is famous for its independent brewery and pub. Like many places in this region (Bingley, Haworth for example) the two villages have a selection of cobbled (or \\"setted\\") roads. TLC buses operate a circular service from Keighley through to Stanbury and Haworth which passes through Laycock. This runs to just four services per day Monday to Saturday with no service on Sundays. Laycock has a primary school on Laycock Lane (the main road through the village) which was rated as 'Good' by Ofsted in 2014. There are just under 100 pupils at the school with an age range of 4-11. The village hall was built in 1927 and regularly hosted the Bronte Blues Club events between 2007 and 2015. The Blues club events attracted many famous names over the years such as Andy Fairweather-Low, Doug MacLeod, Hamilton Loomis and Sherman Robinson.

It has straight grey-green leaves, a 30‚Äì50 cm tall stem, and large showy flowers in late spring or mid-summer that come in shades of pink, from white, lilac, pale lavender and grey-purple. It is veined and dotted pink or maroon. It has a signal patch that is deep maroon and a sparse and brown, purple-brown or reddish beard. Description Iris lortetii is thought to resemble various other irises such as Iris sari, Iris gatesii, and Iris susiana,John Weathers and has been called perhaps the most beautiful Iris in the world. It has a short, stout rhizome, that is brown and fibrous. They grow just under the surface of the soil and form little complex networks. It has grey-green leaves that are straight and sword-shaped. It can grow to between long, and wide. The leaves are larger than those of Iris susiana, (an iris in the same region) and they hide the flower stem. It is deciduous and disappears completely during the dormancy period in winter. It has a flowering stem that is between tall. It has spathes that are long with lanceolate and pale green valves. It carries a solitary flower that blooms in late spring or mid-summer, between April and May. The large flowers are in diameter. The very large showy flowers are variable in colour. They can come in shades of pink, from white, to lilac, pale lavender, and grey-purple. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals) known as the 'falls', and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals, known as the 'standards'. The falls are oblong-obovate shaped and recurved (bent backwards), with maroon, brown, or crimson, lilac to pink dots and veins on a pale blue, lavender, pale cream or yellowish ground. It has a small deep maroon coloured signal patch, and in the middle of the falls, is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which is sparse and brown, purple-brown or reddish in colour. The paler standards are orbicular shaped, with pale lilac veins on a nearly white ground. It has a purplish-brown style with reddish brown lobes, and a long perianth tube. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule, which is pollinated by ants, who also disperse the seeds. Biochemistry In 2006, it was found that the outer integument of I. lorteti and Iris confusa seeds contained a chemical compound, that was toxic to the germinated embryo. Blumentahal also found that the outer integument of I. lorteti and Iris confusa seeds contained a compound toxic to the germinated embryo. Also the iris seeds have a dormancy period of several months, this is due to mechanical resistance of the integument. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count of 2n=20. Taxonomy Iris lortetii It is written in , and in . It is commonly known as 'Lortet's Iris', and it also called 'Samarian Iris', although mainly in Israel. The Latin specific epithet 'lortetii' is derived from Louis Charles √âmile Lortet (1836‚Äì1909) who was a French physician, botanist, zoologist and Egyptologist, he had collected the iris from the Lebanese area of the Upper Galilee, during his travels to Syria in 1880. William Barbey already described Iris lortetii but the name was validly published by Pierre Edmond Boissier in July 1882. It is sometimes incorrectly spelled as Iris lorteti, missing an i at the end of the word. I. lortetii is an tentatively accepted name by the RHS, and it is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 1 December 2004. Iris lortetii var. samariae (Dinsm.) Feinbrun is a known and accepted variant. Distribution and habitat Iris lortetii is native to temperate Asia. Range thumb It is endemic to Israel, Palestine and southern Lebanon, (south of the Litani River) and in Syria. In Israel, it is found in the regions of Upper Galilee, Mount Gilboa, Samarian mountains and Samarian desert. Habitat It grows on well drained, stony terra rossa, or rocky limestone slopes, with open shrubland and sometimes in rock crevices on limestone cliffs. It can also grow in pine forests, or Mediterranean woodlands and shrubland. It can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Conservation Within Israel, Iris lortetii was considered in 2002 as Endangered. The overall population size of the iris is estimated to be less than 10,000 mature individuals and the count is declining. Only four small populations are known at present. The Galilee populations, however, have been growing and expanding since the 1960s. Of the endangered populations, the variety 'samaria' from the northern West Bank is particularly threatened by collection from the wild with the uprooting of its rhizomes for commercial use; at one time it had primarily been a cut flower, sold to customers from the roadside. Large quantities of this plant were collected in the course of the 19th century and then exported to Europe, but the cultivated specimens would die after two seasons of flowering. These short life spans mean that freshly collected rhizomes and plants have regularly been needed to supply the flower industry. The number of individual plants have therefore declined by approximately 10% over the last ten years, and sub-populations are likely to have been lost or become extinct. Other population threats include rapid habitat destruction by afforestation. The rhizomes do not like being crowded or shaded and are difficult to grow with other plants, including those that block their sunlight. Iris populations can be threatened by Quercus calliprinos Webb (the Palestine oak) and Pinus halepensis Miller (the Aleppo pine). In some areas, grazing by herbivorous mammals has aided survival of the iris by reducing other nearby plants. As the iris is protected by the nature conservation laws in Israel, several conservation measures have been proposed to ensure the survival of the remaining populations; these include establishment of an iris reserve and active pollination and reseeding. As the Oncocyclus Irises are difficult to maintain in cultivation, much research has been carried out, especially at the Van Tubergen Nurseries in Haarlem, Netherlands. Keren Kayemet LeIsrael (KKL-JNF) carried out a study in 2012, about growing the iris from seed. Over 3,000 seeds were gathered from all the known indigenous populations, and then scientists sprouted them in greenhouse conditions with the goal of planting them in the wild later on, in the Tel Aviv University Botanical Garden. The mature plants will be planted at selected sites on KKL-JNF lands over the next three years of the study. Various thinning treatments will be carried out, in order to ensure sufficient quantities of light for healthy plants. In the southern hills of Lebanon, the status of the populations of Iris westii and I. lortetii are not known; it has been too dangerous to investigate them due to the extensive placement of explosive mines during the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon between 1985 and 2000. Cultivation I. lortetii is deemed one to be one of the most difficult irises to cultivate in its class. It is hardy to European Zone H4, and USDA Zones 2 to 9. It prefers positions in part shade to full sun, in slightly acidic soils (with a pH level between 5 and 7.5) that are a mix of sand and clay. Like many other irises, it should be kept moist while in growth but completely dry during dormancy (winter time), and high-nitrogen fertilizer should not be given to it. In places where it is not hardy, the plant can be stored in the late summer and fall at 23 ¬∞C, which mimics the hot and dry climate of their natural Mediterranean habitat; however, the rhizomes will lose between 30 and 60% of their weight during storage. Aphid Dysaphis tulipae can be found on the plant. Propagation Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. It was found that the force required to break seed coat is 133.2 MPa (Blumenthal et al., 1986). Blumenthal et al. (1986) found different germination rates among species, from 1% to 60% seed germination in the first year for Iris lortetii Barbey and Iris atropurpurea. Also, the pressure needed to pierce the seed coat of the two species, I. lortetii and I. atropurpurea, was 135 and 77 atmospheres, respectively. Hybrids and cultivars Iris lortetii var. samariae (Dinsm.) Feinbrun is a known variant. It was published in Fl. Palaestina 4: 121 in 1986. It has the synonym of Iris samariae Dinsm., and the common name of 'Samaria Iris', which in written in . Its description differ to Iris lortetii, in several ways such as darker standards, with brownish to purple veins on a cream coloured ground and it blooms in April. Its distribution range is found in Samaria around the city of Nablus (or Schekem) at about 800m above sea level. There is one known cultivar Iris lortetii 'alba' which has pure white flowers. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction. Uses Soon after it was discovered in 1882, a lot of rhizomes were taken for commercial cultivation in Israel. They were exported to Europe for the ornamental plant trade. Unfortunately, the cultivated specimens rarely survived more than 2 seasons, causing a continuous demand for fresh plants and rhizomes. It was also collected extensively for the cut flower industry and was sold in bunches on the side of the road, plants were also moved to decorate the cemeteries in the area. It is still available locally, in Upper Galilee, Israel for sale as garden plants.

He was satirised by a contemporary acting troupe as an ineffectual drunkard (the actors were flogged after Wei made a complaint against this slander). Wei established a school in his home province, where he taught a philosophy based on the Cheng-Zhu school, but influenced by the works of Zhang Shi. Wei was somewhat less rigid in his adherence to the Cheng-Zhu school's precepts than other teachers, and as a result attracted students from other schools of Neo-Confucian thought. He emphasised the connection between nature and morality, and believed that knowledge and capability were innate; despite having a strong moral position and clear stance on personal practice, he was not a great innovator and is generally considered to have promoted the existing teachings of the school rather than creating new concepts within it.

Early life Old was born in Katanning, Western Australia, to Vera Anne (n√©e Cornish) and James William Old. His uncle, Cyril Cornish, was also a member of parliament. After leaving school, Old began working for Goldsbrough Mort & Co., an agricultural retailer. He enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1941, and during the war served on airbases in North-West Australia (including Corunna Downs Airfield) as a wireless operator. After being discharged in 1945, Old returned to Goldsbrough Mort as a manager, working for periods in Perth, Midland, Corrigin, and Moora.

After the election, he was elected deputy chairman of committees in the Legislative Assembly. In May 1975, Ray McPharlin, the NCP leader, withdrew the party from its coalition with the Liberal Party over policy differences. McPharlin was subsequently replaced as leader by Old, and the coalition was resumed. Old became Minister for Agriculture in the new ministry, but was not appointed deputy premier (the traditional position for the leader of the minority party in the coalition) due to Charles Court's belief that he was too inexperienced. Despite Old gaining experience as a minister, he still was not appointed Deputy Premier when the position fell vacant in 1980 and 1982 whilst the Coalition had remained in office. In 1982, when Charles Court was replaced as premier by Ray O'Connor, Old was additionally made Minister for Fisheries and Wildlife. He remained in the ministry until the government's defeat at the 1983 election. Tensions had continued within the NCP after Old's election as leader, and in August 1978 three of its six MPs (Hendy Cowan, Ray McPharlin, and Matt Stephens) left to form their own party, the National Party. The two parties ran candidates against each other in 1980 and 1983, but agreed to merge in 1984, under the name of the National Party. The NCP was not formally wound up until January 1985. Its three remaining members in the Legislative Assembly, Old, Bert Crane, and Peter Jones, refused to join the new unified party, instead switching to the Liberal Party.

It has large upright petals and smaller lower petals, which is unique amongst most iris forms. They come in various shades from white, lavender, mauve, medium purple, violet, dark purple to black. It has a black or purplish black beard on the lower petals. It comes from the region of Transcaucasia, and is found in the countries of Iran, (formerly Persia), Turkey, Armenia and in Azerbaijan. Description I. paradoxa is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial. The rhizomes are slender and usually less than 1 cm in diameter.British Iris Society (1997) It also has secondary roots underneath the rhizomes. It has greenish-gray, or blue-green leaves, that are recurved or falcate (sickle- like) shaped. They are narrow, between wide, and less than 4 cm long. The upright stem grows between long, and hold up to 2 blooms. It blooms in spring, or early summer, between April and June. The flowers are 10 cm in diameter, and come in various shades from white, lavender, mauve, medium purple, violet, dark purple to black. Like other irises, the flowers have 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals, known as the 'standards'. Compared to other irises, the paradoxa or strangeness of the iris, is that in most forms of irises, the standards are smaller than the falls, but on I. paradoxa the falls are much smaller than the standards. The erect standards are broadly obovate, or rounded, and long and wide. They are a pale shade with pale blue or deep blue veining. The smaller falls are a darker colour, blackish-violet, through to pale purple densely overlaid with black-purple veins. They are long and wide. The falls are also covered with blackish, blackish-purple or violet hairs or 'beard' with a pale v-shaped mark in centre. After flowering, it becomes dormant in late summer. The seed capsule produced after flower has not been described. Biochemistry As most irises are diploid, meaning having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. Iris paradoxa has been counted as 2n=20 . Taxonomy Iris paradoxa from Gothenburg Botanical Garden, Sweden Iris paradoxa is classified in the subgenus Iris sub. Iris, Iris sect. Oncocyclus. There is a known form from Turkey called I. paradoxa f. choschab. The Latin specific epithet paradoxa refers to the Greek word for 'unusual',D. Gledhill This is due to being thought being entirely unlike any other species. It was discovered in the Caucus region, and then was first published and described by Steven in 'M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© Imp√©riale des Naturalistes de Moscou' (M√©m. Soc. Imp. Naturalistes Moscou) Vol.5 on page 355 in 1817. It is occasionally called the 'Unusual iris', or 'Velvet Iris' in America.United States Department of Agriculture Forms Iris paradoxa f. choschab from Gothenburg Botanical Garden, Sweden There is a known form called I. paradoxa f. choschab . It was published in Fl. Iran. Vol.112 on page 31 in 1975. Originally Iris paradoxa f. choschab was thought by Johannes Marius Cornelis Hoog to be a variety of I. paradoxa, called I. paradoxa var. choschab and then published in Gard. Chron. III, 29: 104 in 1901, before being downgraded to a form in 1975. It can be found near Lake Van, close to the town of Ba≈ükale, and it is common around the village of Ho≈üap, known for its Ho≈üap Castle, G√ºrpƒ±nar District, Van Province, Eastern Anatolia, Turkey. 'Choschab' was an old version of the Aramaic name of the castle, meaning 'good water' or 'beautiful water'. The village of Ho≈üap is now known by the Turkish name of 'G√ºzelsu'. The form is thought to be most used in cultivation. It has white standards, or pale lilac, lightly veined with blue. The beard is black and covers the upper half of the falls and the style arms are cream, speckled reddish brown. The internal tepals (\\"petals\\") are lined with purple on a white (choschab form) or purple to mauve (paradoxa form) background. Ecology Males of Xylocopa valga (a type of carpenter bee) have been observed pseudo-copulating on the reduced, velvety petals of the plant in Leriksky area, near Gosmaljan, Azerbaijan. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate Western Asia. It is found in the region of Transcaucasia, and in the countries of Iran, (formerly Persia), Turkey, Armenia and in Azerbaijan, (including in the Nakhchivan region). It grows on arid, stony hillsides and they can be found at altitude between above sea level. Cultivation I. paradoxa can be easily grown in an Alpine house., or they can be in placed in rock gardens, which should have a summer drought. They grow well in full sun with mildly acidic to mildly alkaline soils (of ph levels between 6.1 - 7.8). The flower and stem, (if removed from the plant) may have a shelf life of two to three days. Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. I. paradoxa has been listed with Iris orientalis and Iris spuria subsp. musulmanica as halophyte (salt-tolerant) plants.M. Ajmal Khan, Benno Boer and Munir Ozturk (Editors) Cultivars and crosses Iris paradoxa has been used in various breeding programmes and various cultivars have been produced including: 'Atrata', 'Choschab', 'Jolfa Form', 'Medwedewi', 'Mirabilis', 'Paradoxa' and 'Paradoxa Albo-Lutescens'.

She was murdered in the early hours of the morning of 12 July 2002 as she walked home from a night out with friends.Convicted murderer Omar Benguit offered hope of release, Bournemouth Echo. Omar Benguit was arrested for the murder of Jong-Ok Shin on 22 August 2002, by Dorset Police, and was later convicted after a second re-trial in 2005 at Winchester Crown Court. Omar was sentenced to life imprisonment and has had two failed attempts at the Court of Appeal. His first appeal was in 2005 and second was in 2014.Omar Benguit appeal fails as murder conviction upheld, BBC News He now remains at a category A prison in England and still maintains his innocence.  Murder of Jong-Ok Shin  On Friday 12 July 2002, at around 2:50 am, 26-year-old Jong-Ok Shin was murdered on Malmesbury Park Road, Bournemouth.Man convicted of Oki murder innocent, says legal expert, Bournemouth Echo. It is known that the Korean student was walking home following a night out with friends at a popular student wine bar, The Bank. Shin was discovered by residents of a nearby house who called for an ambulance. Shin later died in hospital as a result of three stab wounds to the back, with an approximately 14‚Äì15 cm blade. The knife used during the attack has never been recovered. Despite the police responding promptly to the report of the attack, there was no forensic evidence obtained at the scene. Residents in the street reported that the night was quiet, although one witness said he could hear an argument between a man with a foreign accent and a woman followed by low groans from the woman. Other residents reported hearing a vehicle with a loud exhaust making a U-turn and driving off. The car however was traced to another resident living in the street. Omar Benguit was arrested on 22 August, almost six weeks after the murder, after being named as the killer by a police informant. Beverly Brown, a heroin addict and prostitute, claimed that she was with Omar and two other males on the night of the murder. The two other males were later named as Nicholas Gbadamosi and Delroy Woolry. Brown says she had been forced by the males to drive them around, when Omar told her to pull over near to Shin, who was walking along Malmesbury Park Road alone. Brown alleges that Benguit approached Shin and asked her to come party with them and when she refused, he stabbed her. However, much controversy surrounds this statement.  Trials   First Trial  After being charged with the murder of Jong-Ok Shin, Omar Benguit and Nicholas Gbadamosi stood trial. Benguit for the murder of Shin and Gbadamosi for assisting Benguit. Both of the males also stood trial for the rape of Beverly Brown, occurring later in the morning of 12 July. It is worth noting that Delroy Woolry was named by Beverley Brown as also being in the car that night, and being an active participant in the gang rape of her later that morning. However, Woolry was deported back to his country of birth Jamaica, allegedly because his visa had expired. Woolry has never been on trial for these charges as, despite the serious nature of Beverley Brown's allegations, he was never extradited. The jury cleared Gbadamosi of the rape charges. The Jury of the first trial failed to deliver a verdict of either Benguit murdering Shin or Gbadamosi assisting him. The Jury had also failed to reach a verdict on the rape charge against Benguit.  Second Trial  In 2004, a re-trial was held on the basis of the charges which the jury had been unable to reach a verdict on in the first trial. During this trial, it came to light that Gbadamosi had in fact been caught on a speed camera during the time the alleged rape took place. This again highlights the weakness of Beverly Brown's statement. However, at the end of the trial, the jury only acquitted Benguit of the rape charge and Gbadamosi of assisting Benguit in the murder of Shin. Whilst remanded in custody for the duration of both trials, Benguit had suffered a series of brutal attacks. In spite of the lack of forensic evidence and CCTV, and the accounts of the main witness being proved false with the discovery of the speed camera footage, the jury again failed to reach a verdict for Benguit regarding the murder of Shin.  Third Retrial  With Gbadamosi acquitted, Benguit was the only suspect left. In order to secure this third re-trial, permission had to be sought from the director of public prosecutions. The trial took place in 2005 and eventually, Benguit was found guilty of the murder of Shin. Again, Beverly Brown was used as the main witness, in spite of her questionable reliability. All the other witnesses that the prosecution relied on were convicted drug addicts and prostitutes. All evidence from these witnesses was purely circumstantial. Despite their heavy reliance and dependence on Class A drugs, the witnesses had, apparently perfect memory. It was at the conclusion of this trial that Mr Benguit was found guilty of murder by the jury and sentenced to life imprisonment by Mrs Justice Hallett at Winchester Crown Court.  Appeals   First Appeal  On 12 July 2005, three years after the murder, Benguit's first appeal of his conviction took place in the Court of Appeal.Portsmouth, Making a murder innocence project working to clear killer Omar Benguit's name. The first ground of appeal, made by Anthony Donne, was that the ruling to allow a second retrial was wrong. The second retrial was allowed on the grounds that it was in the public's interest to obtain a conviction, however his defence argued that it was unjust. The second ground for appeal was the allowance of evidence from two witnesses who had apparently at some point in the past seen Benguit carrying a knife, similar to that used in the murder. The defence also wished to draw attention to the fact that Beverly Brown's evidence should not have been admissible in the second retrial as it had been proved to be unreliable. She had given a number of different versions about the offence, including lying in her first and second statements on her own admission. Donne argued that due to the lack of forensic evidence and reliance on hearsay evidence of admitted drug addicts, the ruling to allow a second retrial was wrong.Regina v Omar Benguit (2005). The appeal was dismissed as the Court of Appeal concluded that the decision made by the judge, Mrs Justice Hallett, to allow a second retrial was correct. The process of the second retrial was not unjust nor prejudicial. Anthony Donne QC stood as Benguit's counsel in the appeal but had not represented him at any previous trials.  Second Appeal  In 2012 the Criminal Cases Review Commission referred Benguit's case to the Court of Appeal, following a successful application to the review body, and on 9 April 2014 the appeal took place. The evidence used by Benguit's defence team was that Beverly Brown, the lead witness, had appeared on the ITV show the Jeremy Kyle Show, giving a different account of the crime than what she gave in the original trials. The credibility of Brown was tested before the jury, and it was concluded that although Brown exaggerated her account of the crime, the essence of the crime never changed and the appearance was not done for financial gain. The judges concluded that Brown's account had \\"significant circumstantial support\\" from other witnesses. It was also argued by the defence that an Italian man, Danilo Restivo,Danilo Restivo killing third case claim, The Guardian. convicted of two other murders who was living in the area at the time, was a more likely suspect for the crime. It was suggested that the murder of Shin resembled similarities between Restivo's other murders. Restivo murdered Elisa Claps on 12 September 1993 and Heather Barnett, who was killed in her home on 12 November 2002. However, the judges argued that there were numerous differences between the murder of Miss Claps and Mrs Barnett, and that of Miss Shin.Appeal ruling over Bournemouth student murder, Heart.Omar Benguit murder appeal dismissed, itv.Student killer's a case reviewed as Danilo Restivo is made a suspect, Bournemouth Echo. The court did recognise that the case was not supported by any forensic evidence, however it was argued that there was ‚Äòsignificant circumstantial support‚Äô against Benguit. This included previous convictions for carrying a knife, blood found on his clothing after the crime and an apparent confession made by Benguit to stabbing a student in Charminster. Lady Justice Rafferty, Mr Justice Cranston and Mr Justice Stewart dismissed the appeal.Regina v Omar Benguit (2014).  Beverley Brown  Beverly Dawn Brown is perceived as a principal witness in the murder of Jong-Ok Shin, after accusing Benguit, Gbadamosi and Woolry of the murder. In her statement to the police, she described how she had been driving the three males that night when they had asked her to pull over. She then stated that Omar had exited the vehicle, stabbed Shin and returned to her car. She was subsequently interviewed several times regarding the murder of Miss Shin, apparently with the intent to find information to be used in the conviction trial of Omar Benguit. Brown was known to be a drug addict (and a prostitute), which may partially explain her changing story of what allegedly happened that night, and her serious allegations against Benguit and the other two men. A relevant example of a misleading statement provided by Beverly is her appearance at the Jeremy Kyle's TV show, when she revealed an idea of seeing Omar Benguit performing/executing the murder act ‚Äì this information significantly differed from that given during the trials where she said she had not witnessed the murder of Shin.Omar Benguit - Jeremy Kyle Show Witness, Beverly Dawn Brown. Brown also accused Benguit and Gbadamosi of raping her in the early hours of the morning after the murder, however both were found not guilty of this in the second trial.  Danilo Restivo  During the second appeal, Benguit's defence suggested that the true murderer of Oki-Shin was Danilo Restivo, who has since been found guilty of two murders. In May 2002, Restivo arrived in England from Italy and moved to Bournemouth. On 12 November 2002, Heather Barnett was found dead in her home as result of a head injury. There had been an attempt to remove her head, resulting in a bad injury to her neck. There was also a lock of hair placed in her right hand, however the hair found was not from the victim. In March 2010, the body of Elisa Claps, who had disappeared in 1993, was found in a church in Italy. In addition, a clump of hair had been cut from her head and placed in her hand shortly after her death. The Italian investigators found DNA and other evidence that indicated that Restivo was the murderer of Claps. Following the discovery of DNA linking Restivo to the murder of Heather Barnett, he was put on trial for murder and got sentenced to a whole life sentence in 2011. On appeal, his sentence was reduced to 40 years. Restivo is currently in prison in England, and unlikely to ever be released from custody as he would be deported to Italy immediately upon release to serve a life sentence for the murder of Elisa Claps.Danilo Restivo convicted of Elisa Claps murder in Italy, BBC News. However, Restivo has also been accused of committing the murder of Jong-Ok Shin on 12 July 2002 in Bournemouth. A clump of hair was found at the very spot where the victim had been stabbed, which threw suspicion onto Restivo. Just before the 2nd appeal in 2014 Dorset police produced a witness statement for the first time from a woman who had apparently been identified from the hair and who stated that she had lived opposite the crime scene. She recalled using a mobile hairdresser 12 years earlier and implied that she may have deposited the clump of hair in the rubbish bins which somehow was blown to the spot where the victim was stabbed. Other reasons that may link Restivo to the murder of Jong- Ok Shin include the finding of a balaclava in Restivo's possession. Shin described her murderer to have been wearing a mask before she was taken to hospital. Furthermore, an identical knife to that used to attack Shin was found in Restivo's bag when he was arrested in 2004 for another offence. Finally a man resembling Restivo carrying a satchel was seen on CCTV near the crime scene at six minutes past the time of the murder. This evidence was not relied on by Benguit's barrister Rag Chand who was dismissed from the case by Benguit's family following the court of appeal decision.

Philip Styles (London, 1945), pp. 62‚Äì65. History There has been a church on the site since at least 1286. The current church was built in 1875 and has views south over the river Avon, Warwickshire and the Cotswolds. It was built by the Conway family (the owners of the manor of Binton) and mainly paid for by the wife of Francis Seymour, 5th Marquess of Hertford. One 19th-century rector of the church had stated that the village's inhabitants were mainly agricultural workers and thus unable to contribute to the costs of maintaining the church, meaning he had to seek contributions from the local gentry instead. Signs of the original church remain, however. A picture of the original church can be seen at the back of the current church. There is a 15th-century font and cover and a mediaeval parish chest with three locks and bound with iron bands. Furthermore, there is a stained-glass window in memory of Sir John Greville, who died in 1444 and was an MP in seven Parliaments. He is buried at All Saints Church, Weston-on- Avon. The window depicts the arms of the Greville family of Milcote. There is also a piece of wood depicting the royal coat of arms. It must date from 1714‚Äì1801 as it includes the white horse of Hanover. Finally, by the gate to enter the churchyard, there are steps built into the wall, so as to avoid using the gate. The purpose of these was for people arriving to church by horseback could easily dismount, there is still a ring by these steps where the horses would be tied. The Scott Window The Scott Window, panel 4 (detail): searchers erect a memorial cairn The main feature of the church of St Peter is a memorial window by Kempe (1915), dedicated to Robert Falcon Scott and his co-explorers who died in their failed attempt to return from the South Pole. The window shows four scenes of the 1912 expedition. Scott had married Kathleen Bruce, sister of the Reverend Lloyd Harvey Bruce, Binton's rector 1906‚Äì24. Scott frequently visited the Rectory (now The Grange). Alongside the window is a memorial cross for the Revd Bruce, with a bronze sculpture of Christ designed by Kathleen. The church has one bell, cast by Henry Bagley of Chacombe in 1669.

Early life  The Chiaramonti family was noble and wealthy, claiming to have originated in Clermont and moved to Italy in the fourteenth century. Pope Pius VII (1742‚Äì1823) was from the same family. The son of a doctor, Scipione studied at the University of Ferrara, lodging first at the house of Cardinal Alessandro d‚ÄôEste and later associating with the circle of Cardinal Curzio Sangiorgi. In 1588 he married Virginia Abbati, with whom he was to father twelve children (including at least seven boys). In 1592 he met Galileo, passing through Cesena on his way to Pesaro, who described him as 'very gifted in mathematics'; the same year he graduated in philosophy. He spent a short period in Faenza where, in 1598 he wrote a treatise on mathematical problems in artillery; in 1601, he was hired, at annual salary of 340 scudi, as \\"interpreter of natural philosophy to the academy of Perugia\\" and also received an annual allowance of 400 ducats from Cardinal Alessandro d'Este. He was highly regarded by the Cardinal's half-brother, Cesare d'Este, Duke of Modena whom he served as mathematician and advisor, and who took two of his sons, Virginio and Niccol√≤, as his pages. He was for a time also in the service of Cardinal Cinzio Passeri Aldobrandini. Some time between 1610 and 1614 he composed a treatise on stage scenery.  Opposition to Tycho Brahe  In 1618 three comets appeared over Europe, and Chiaromonti dedicated his first printed work, Discorso della cometa pogonare dell'anno MDCXVIII to Cesare d'Este. He thus entered into a scientific polemic on the nature of comets that involved Orazio Grassi and Galileo; while Galileo held that they were most likely optical illusions rather than heavenly bodies, Chiaramonti argued that comets were made of 'elemental substance', did display parallax and were definitely sublunar. Just as Galileo sought to interpret the phenomenon of comets in a way which supported Copernican heliocentrism, Chiaramonti explained it with the intention of supporting the traditional geocentric model. Chiaramonti was such a determined defender of classical astronomy that he rejected even the Tychonic system, which was by then commonly accepted among Jesuit scholars and other astronomers who did not agree with the views of Copernicus. Chiaramonti's second and more significant venture into this scholarly field came with his 1621 work Antitycho which opposed the argument of Tycho Brahe that comets were celestial bodies following an orbit above the Moon. In this work Chiaramonti tackled not only Tycho but Grassi, devoting 10 of the work's 65 chapters to refuting his arguments about comets. When Johannes Kepler received a copy of Antitycho, he replied with Shieldbearer for Tycho. Despite the fundamental difference of views with Chiaramonti, Galileo maintained cordial relations with him at this time, referring to him positively in The Assayer as having conclusively proved the falsity of Tycho's model of the universe. Galileo's views may have hardened after Chiaramonti replied to Kepler's Shieldbearer in 1626 with his Apologia pro Antitychone. In this he reiterated what Benedetto Castelli described as \\"ridiculous and impossible\\" opinions on comets and stars. Mario Guiducci scorned him as a \\"cold, insipid Perpiatetic\\" who needed \\"a good ironing.\\" In contrast, Chiaramonti's standing in Church circles continued to rise, and he served as a consultant to the Holy Office in Cesena. Many conservative churchmen in Rome were convinced that they had found in him the champion who would overcome dangerous innovations and restore traditional certainties. As Guiducci reported to Galileo, some believed that Chiaramonti would prove able to resolve the question of the earth's movement in favour of Ptolemy. The poet Pier Francesco Minozzi praised him in verse as ‚Äòthe Aristotle of our times.‚Äô  'Enemy of Astronomers'  In 1627 Chiaramonti was elected to the chair in philosophy at the University of Pisa with an annual salary of 700 ducats, where he remained until 1636. In 1629 he applied to the more prestigious university of Bologna to teach mathematics, but his appointment was blocked, with particularly strong opposition from Galileo's friend Cesare Marsili, who described him as \\"such an enemy of astronomers\\" (\\"tanto nemico degli astronomi\\"). In 1628 Chiaramonti published another attack on both Tycho and Copernicus, De Tribus Novis Stellis. This was concerned with three transient 'new stars' in 1572, 1600 and 1604. His purpose was to refute arguments that these were actual stars rather than sublunary events. The publication of Galileo's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems in Italian in 1632 and then in Latin in 1635, dealt a serious blow to Chiaramonti's scientific credibility. In the dialogue, arguments that he had used in past were placed in the mouth of Galileo's idiot character Simplicius in such way that, as Chiaramonti himself commented, only a \\"scempio\\" (\\"disgrace\\", \\"total mess\\") like Simplicio could possibly believe them. The character of Salivati firmly rebuts these points, dismissing \\"Antitycho\\" as a work hardly meriting serious attention, and referring to existence of sunspots, which not only darken the surface of the Sun, but cast a shadow on the whole of peripatetic philosophy. Chiaramonti is explicitly named in the \\"Dialogue\\", and Salviati says that as he is not present to answer his questions, he invites Simplicio to respond in his place. Simplicio does so, quoting verbatim from Chiaramonti's De Tribus Novis Stellis. Chiaramonti responded to Galileo almost at once with a dialogue of his own, the Difesa di Scipione Chiaramonti da Cesena al suo Antiticone (1633). In this he argued a position that \\"is neither well presented [i.e. by Salviati to Simplicio].... nor is it answered by him.\\" Chiaramonti rewrote this entire section of Galileo's Dialogue, challenging Galileo's logic and inserting responses in the Salviati-Simplicio conversation to indicate what he would have said in place of Simplicio's weak replies. Galileo's supporters were scathing about this book, but Galileo was unable to respond to it publicly. In October 1632 he had been summoned to Rome for questioning by the Inquisition following the publication of his \\"Dialogue\\" and in April 1633 his trial began. One of his judges was Cardinal Francesco Barberini, nephew of the Pope, and Grand Inquisitor, to whom Chiaramonti had dedicated his Difesa. In a letter to √âlie Diodati on 25 July 1634 Galileo complained that in the Difesa, Chiaramonti had allowed himself to be drawn into writing 'exaggerated' and 'reckless' things which, outside of present circumstances, could easily have been refuted.  Later disputes  In 1635 Chiaramonti published a work of political philosophy, Della Ragion di Stato which examined at great length different possible definitions of the terms 'reason' and 'state' and considered the dilemmas of statecraft and morality. The following year he left his position at Pisa, was unsuccessful in soliciting a chair at the University of Padua (which he wanted to secure without competition and with a salary of more than 600 sequins), and retired to Cesena. Here he devoted much of his time to an 887-page history of his native city, Caesenae historia, which was published in 1641. The remainder of his attention returned to the territory of scholarly disputes; :it:Giovanni Camillo Glorioso had criticised his De Tribus and in 1636 Charamonti published a refutation, Examen censurae Gloriosi, to which Glorioso replied the following year Castigatio examinis. To this Chiaramonti responded in turn with Castigatio Ioannis Camilli Gloriosi aduersus Scipionem Claramontium Caesenatem (1638). Glorioso's final contribution to this dispute was his Responsio (1641). As he died soon after, this allowed Chiaramonti the last word, which he took with a volume of more than 500 pages, summarising his Aristotelian positions on a wide range of topics, his Opus Scipionis Claramontis Caesenatis de Universo (1644). No less acrimonious was his dispute with Galileo's friend Fortunio Liceti, founded on the same wish to defend Aristotle against any modern observation or experiment. This polemic was opened by Chiaramonti in 1636 and was fought by exchange of pamphlets until 1648. While pursuing these extended arguments, Chiaramonti produced a number of systematic treatises which reaffirmed classical Aristotelian thinking, and in 1643, the year after Galileo's death, he published an attack on his views in Antiphilolaus.  Later life  Chiaramonti's wife died in 1644; there is an account that at the age of eighty he remarried to a much younger wife, but the consensus is that soon after he widowed, he joined the Capuchin order to which four of his sons already belonged, and erected at his own expense a church dedicated to Saint Philip and Saint Cecilia. He died in Cesena on 3 October 1652.  Works     References  Italian philosophers 1565 births 1652 deaths Galileo Galilei ","title":"Scipione Chiaramonti"},{"id":"52837044","text":"S. M.

Sorrow and Parachute. Biography Wally Waller was born Alan Edward Waller in Barnehurst and grew up in neighbouring Bexley, then in Kent. In the early 1960s, Wally Waller played the rhythm guitar in Bern Elliott and the Fenmen, a five-piece beat and rhythm and blues band. They had a Top 20 hit with their cover of \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\" in December 1963. When lead singer Bern Elliott left the band, early in 1964, the other four continued as The Fenmen, releasing a few singles with strong vocal harmonies, such as their cover of \\"California Dreamin'\\" in 1966. Their last single, \\"Rejected\\", featured one of the first songs penned by Waller as an A-side. In the early months of 1967, Wally Waller joined Pretty Things as a bass player, replacing John Stax. At the same time, Jon Povey, the Fenmen's drummer, became the Pretty Things' keyboardist. Waller was a childhood friend of lead singer Phil May, and they started writing songs together for the Things' third studio album, Emotions, released in 1967. Their musical partnership continued on the next two albums, the rock opera S.F. Sorrow (1968) and its follow-up Parachute (1970), the latter being entirely written by May and Waller. Wally Waller left the Pretty Things in 1971 to take up a job as producer for EMI at the invitation of Norman Smith. As a producer, he worked for Barclay James Harvest and Marcus Hook Roll Band, among others. He also produced the Pretty Things' Freeway Madness under the alias \\"Asa Jones\\", since the Things were then signed on Warner Bros. He contributed the song \\"Over the Moon\\" to the album and sang lead, also singing backing vocals on several other songs. He joined again the Pretty Things from 1978 to 1981 and from 1994 to 2008.

The authorities were forced to raise the volume on the loudspeakers playing lamentation songs after some in the crowds took up cries of using name of former presidential candidate, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, who has been under house arrest since 2011. Some of the chants were aimed at Russia, Iran's ally in the Syrian conflict. Video clips on social media showed mourners shouting \\"Death to Russia\\" (which was also shouted during the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests after Russian President Dmitry Medvedev became the first foreign leader to congratulate Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on his re-election) and \\"the Russian Embassy is the den of espionage,\\" as they passed the embassy's complex in the heart of Tehran. People also called for the release of hunger strikers in Iranian prisons.

It was led by Viceroy Dom Constantino de Bragan√ßa and resulted in the capture of the capital, Nallur. The king of Jaffna, Cankili I, managed to escape and regained the capital through a pact that he made with the Portuguese. He subsequently incited a peoples' rebellion against the Portuguese, resulting in their withdrawing their forces from Nallur. The Jaffna Kingdom, however, lost its sovereignty over Mannar Island and its main town, Mannar.  Background  The massacre of about 600 to 700 Christians in Mannar in 1544 by Cankili I enraged Catholic priests, who complained to the Portuguese authorities in Goa. The Portuguese did not carry out any reprisals, however, as they were facing hostilities in India. The complaint eventually reached the King Jo√£o III, who ordered his forces at Goa to punish the King of Jaffna for his actions. There was a delay in carrying out the order. When Dom Constantino left Portugal in 1558, Queen Catherine instructed him to execute the king's order, which had been delayed for various reasons. She ordered that the king of Jaffna should be punished especially for the Mannar massacre and the continuing persecution of Christians.  Battle  Dom Constantino sailed in September 1560 from Goa to Jaffna with 20 galleys, 10 galiots, and 70 ships. The forces consisted of 1,200 soldiers; that small number of troops was unfit to carry out the planned invasion. The forces reached the shore of Colombuthurai, where they were met by the Jaffna forces of 2,000 soldiers led by a prince. The heavy artillery barrage from the Portuguese ships inflicted significant casualties on the Jaffna forces, and as a result, the Portuguese forces were able to reach land and advance on the capital. The capital was located on an open plain and fortified by stones and sands, with some strong bastions provided with artillery and much infantry. The capital fell to the Portuguese and the king withdrew his forces to a small fort in Kopay. Before the next day's dawn, the palace was set afire and the king escaped to the Vanni region. A group of Portuguese soldiers followed in an attempt to capture him, but were unsuccessful.  Pact  Acknowledging that he was not in a position to repel the enemy forces, the king sent Dom Constantino to sue for peace. The viceroy seized the opportunity, as he had limited troops and was short of food and ammunition. The provisions of the pact signed between the warring parties were as follows: * The king and his son were allowed to continue to rule the kingdom * Control of Mannar Island and the western shore would be ceded to the Portuguese * Jaffna forces were not permitted firearms and other explosive weapons * Jaffna was not allowed to employ foreign forces * Portuguese forces were permitted to remain in Jaffna * The hidden treasury of the father of the Kotte king was to be handed over to the Portuguese * Every year a certain number of elephants would be provided to the Portuguese as a tribute * Catholic missionary work was not allowed to be disrupted * A prince and two Mudaliyars would be retained by the Portuguese to secure the provisions of the pact See also *Portuguese invasion of Jaffna kingdom (1591)  References   Further reading  978 06 464 54283 Battles involving the Jaffna kingdom Battles involving Portugal 1560 in Asia 16th century in Sri Lanka Jaffna kingdom (1560) Conflicts in 1560 ","title":"Portuguese invasion of Jaffna kingdom (1560)"},{"id":"52837232","text":"5th Kaluga Regiment of Emperor Wilhelm I (5-–π –ø–µ—Ö–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–π –ö–∞–ª—É–∂—Å–∫–∏–π –ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ –í–∏–ª—å–≥–µ–ª—å–º–∞ 1-–≥–æ –ø–æ–ª–∫)-Regiment of the period of the Russian Empire.

The hatchery operated from 1895 to 1960, producing fish stock for headwater tributaries of the Connecticut River and St. Lawrence River in northern New England and New York. The surviving facilities of the hatchery, now adaptively reused for other purposes and in private ownership, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. History The St. Johnsbury Federal Fish Culture Station was established by an Act of Congress in 1891, to establish and propagate populations of lake trout and salmon in upland tributaries of the Connecticut and St. Lawrence Rivers in northern New England and New York. A site was selected on the west bank of the Sleepers River, a tributary of the Passumpsic River on the outskirts of St. Johnsbury, Vermont, and the facility began production in 1895. The property included water rights on the river, and a freshwater spring that over time proved inadequate to meet the facility's needs. with The facility was nearly closed due to budget cuts in 1934, but remained open due to a cooperative arrangement between federal and state governments. Issues with the high summertime water temperature of the Sleepers River (which affected production of stock requiring lower temperatures) and the inadequacy of its cold-water springs, prompted the decision to close the facility in 1959. It ceased production in 1960, and was sold into private ownership in 1961. Most of its rearing ponds have been filled in, although subsurface plumbing survives, as does its dam, about upriver from the remaining buildings. Those buildings underwent restoration in 2001-02 and have been put to other uses. Surviving facilities The station facilities are located about northwest of downtown St. Johnsbury, and are sandwiched between the Sleepers River and United States Route 2, just north of the latter's junction with Interstate 91. They are at the southern end of Emerson Falls Road. The main hatchery building is a particularly fine example of Shingle style architecture, designed by Herbert Von Bayer, an architect working for the US Fish and Wildlife Service. It is two stories in height, and has a prominent pyramidal turret at one corner, with an arched porte-cochere adjacent. Located nearby is the former superintendent's residence, built in 1898 to a design by local architect Lambert Packard. Behind the house stands a c. 1900 carriage barn. The grounds in the area also include filled or partially-filled ponds and raceways for managing waterflow through the facility, as well as subsurface plumbing.

For some reason RCA Victor (possibly considering it as a single candidateJorgensen, Elvis Presley A Life in Music: The Complete Recording Sessions.

Over many years he was a prominent radical. Personal life Beal was born in Chelsea, London, and worked as an auctioneer and land agent. His father was a tradesman, with a Yorkshire background. He initially worked as a solicitor's clerk, and then for an upholsterer.s:Eminent English liberals in and out of Parliament/James Beal With a successful career in business, he later had offices at 209 Piccadilly (1866), and 20 Regent Street. His side interests in radical politics led him into pamphleteering, and were diverse. Early activism Through the Metropolitan Parliamentary Reform Association, Beal met Francis Place and the Chartist carpenter George Huggett. He took part in the campaign against the taxes on knowledge. Beal became an active reformer in the 1850s, and was a prominent political figure in the constituency from 1852. His early efforts there were thwarted by the Liberal Registration Society, which successfully brought in Sir John Villiers Shelley, 7th Baronet as candidate for Westminster, at the 1852 general election. With the bookseller Charles Westerton as ally, and local Chartist figures, Beal ran a vigorous and populist campaign for William Coningham, to no avail. Subsequently Sir George DeLacy Evans held the seat, to 1865. Municipal reform Charles Westerton, Beal's ally, was elected to the London Metropolitan Board of Works in 1864. That year, Beal brought up 14 charges against the Board of Works, which are mostly now not considered well-founded. His scatter-gun approach included accusations of improper behaviour aimed at three Members of Parliament: Frederick Doulton, Sir William Jackson, 1st Baronet and Meaburn Staniland. Doulton was in the end tarnished by scandal in some opaque dealings, and resigned as MP. Beal himself belonged to the select vestry of St James, Westminster, at the period the local government body for the civil parish. He became an advocate of the merging of London's vestries into municipal boroughs, coextensive with parliamentary constituencies. He invited John Stuart Mill to become a parliamentary candidate, and chaired the Westminster Liberal Electoral Committee that promoted Mill's successful 1865 candidacy for Westminster. The Metropolitan Municipal Association was founded by Beal in 1866, and Mill represented its views in parliament. In 1867 Beal had assistance from John Malcolm Forbes Ludlow in preparing bills. In the meantime, the Tory William Henry Smith made preparations that came to fruit in the 1868 general election, Beal later considering that the Liberals in Westminster had not engaged on the issues that mattered most to voters, the animation of election meetings ceasing after the days of the Anti-Corn Law League. With Charles Buxton, Beal opposed the dominant position of the City of London Corporation in local government, under the slogan \\"the Juggernaut of Guildhall\\". Joseph Firth Bottomley Firth in 1876 described him as \\"the father of Municipal Reform in London\\". Bottomley Firth and Sir Charles Dilke were Chelsea neighbours of Beal, and together took up municipal reform with him. The Marxist H. M. Hyndman in 1887 criticised the \\"middle-class standpoint\\" of this group, suggesting that Beal would be happy to have the Duke of Westminster as Mayor of a Greater London. Other interests In 1855 Beal attacked primogeniture. He supported \\"free trade in land\\" with Cobdenite arguments, as became common at this period; and promoted freehold land societies, and building societies. In 1861 he was advocating the replacement of income tax, to the London Financial Reform Association. His preference was for a land tax. Beal ran utilities campaigns, intending to improve the consumers' lot in the supply of gas and water. He was active against the gas companies from 1857 to the passing of the Metropolitan Gas Act 1860. The outcome did not satisfy Beal, and in 1875 the Metropolitan Municipal Association sent a deputation to Sir Charles Adderley, President of the Board of Trade; further legislation was proposed. The gas companies played for time, but in 1876 three of the largest amalgamated. For water, its quality from the health point of view, and the regularity of supply, were ongoing issues. The main debate at mid-century, however, was over who should run the system and at what cost. A clash on 10 April 1855, concerning an election for churchwardens at St Barnabas, Pimlico, led Beal into a court case on ritualism, against Rev. Robert Liddell. Liddell was a Tractarian advocate of music, in particular, to bring solemnity into the liturgy. A consistorial court decision by Stephen Lushington, on 5 December 1855, found in favour of Beal, with Charles Westerton, who were trying to limit ritual objects. The judgement was partially reversed on appeal. During the 1874 general election Beal himself was induced to come forward as a candidate for Westminster, on a thorough secular and egalitarian platform. He encountered the rival Liberal Sir Thomas Buxton, 3rd Baronet, with views more orthodox for the party. In the end Beal withdrew. In 1880 he supported John Morley's candidature at Westminster, which was unsuccessful. Beal was a member of the City Guilds Reform Association. In 1882 he gave evidence to the City of London Livery Companies Commission.'Evidences, 1882: Mr. James Beal', in City of London Livery Companies Commission. Report; Volume 1 (London, 1884), pp. 115‚Äì142. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/livery-companies- commission/vol1/pp115-142 [accessed 11 January 2017]. His interests in this area included the control of charity funds, with an eye on defraying the expenses of an educational system. In 1875, he chaired a meeting for Thomas Holloway, discussing what became Royal Holloway College. He acted for Holloway also on behalf of Holloway Sanatorium. Later life The Metropolitan Municipal Association did not in the longer term have a broad base of support, and in 1881 was absorbed into the London Municipal Reform League. In 1888 Beal was elected to the London County Council, representing Fulham, and standing, as did Firth who was also successful, for the Progressive Party. He was one of the small minority who opposed Lord Rosebery as chairman of the Provisional Council. He himself became chairman of its water committee. There he brought London's water supply under municipal control, an ambition he had harboured for two decades.

It is based on spread spectrum modulation techniques derived from chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technology. It was developed by Cycleo of Grenoble, France and acquired by Semtech, the founding member of the LoRa Alliance.  Features  LoRa uses license-free sub-gigahertz radio frequency bands like 433 MHz, 868 MHz (Europe), 915 MHz (Australia and North America), 865 MHz to 867 MHz (India) and 923 MHz (Asia). LoRa enables long-range transmissions (more than 10 km in rural areas) with low power consumption. The technology covers the physical layer, while other technologies and protocols such as LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) cover the upper layers. It can achieve data rate from 27 Kbps to 0.3 Kbps depending upon the spreading factor. In January 2018, new LoRa chipsets were announced, with reduced power consumption, increased transmission power, and reduced size compared to older generation. LoRa devices have geolocation capabilities used for trilaterating positions of devices via timestamps from gateways. LoRa and LoRaWAN permit long-range connectivity for Internet of things (IoT) devices in different types of industries. Range extenders for LoRaWAN are called LoRaX. LoRa PHY LoRa uses a proprietary spread spectrum modulation that is similar to and a derivative of chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulation. The spread spectrum LoRa modulation is performed by representing each bit of payload information by multiple chirps of information. The rate at which the spread information is sent is referred to as the symbol rate, the ratio between the nominal symbol rate and chirp rate is the spreading factor (SF) and represents the number of symbols sent per bit of information. LoRa can trade off data rate for sensitivity with a fixed channel bandwidth by selecting the amount of spread used (a selectable radio parameter from 7 to 12). Lower SF means more chirps are sent per second; hence, you can encode more data per second. Higher SF implies fewer chirps per second; hence, there are fewer data to encode per second. Compared to lower SF, sending the same amount of data with higher SF needs more transmission time, known as airtime. More airtime means that the modem is up and running longer and consuming more energy. The benefit of high SF is that more extended airtime gives the receiver more opportunities to sample the signal power which results in better sensitivity. In addition, LoRa uses forward error correction coding to improve resilience against interference. LoRa's high range is characterized by high wireless link budgets of around 155 dB to 170 dB. LoRaWAN Since LoRa defines the lower physical layer, the upper networking layers were lacking. LoRaWAN is one of several protocols that were developed to define the upper layers of the network. LoRaWAN is a cloud-based medium access control (MAC) layer protocol but acts mainly as a network layer protocol for managing communication between LPWAN gateways and end-node devices as a routing protocol, maintained by the LoRa Alliance. LoRaWAN defines the communication protocol and system architecture for the network, while the LoRa physical layer enables the long-range communication link. LoRaWAN is also responsible for managing the communication frequencies, data rate, and power for all devices. Devices in the network are asynchronous and transmit when they have data available to send. Data transmitted by an end-node device is received by multiple gateways, which forward the data packets to a centralized network server. The network server filters duplicate packets, performs security checks, and manages the network. Data is then forwarded to application servers. The technology shows high reliability for the moderate load, however, it has some performance issues related to sending acknowledgements.

History In the first publication in 1957 on the (what is now called) pseudo Jahn‚ÄìTeller effect (PJTE), √ñpik and Pryce showed that a small splitting of the degenerate electronic term does not necessarily remove the instability and distortion of the polyatomic system induced by the Jahn‚ÄìTeller effect (JTE), provided the splitting is sufficiently small (the two split states remain ‚Äúpseudodegenerate‚Äù), and the vibronic coupling between them is strong enough. From another perspective, the idea of vibronic admixture of different electronic terms by low-symmetry vibrations was introduced in 1933 by Herzberg and Teller to explore forbidden electronic transitions, and extended in the late 1950s by Murrell and Pople and by Liehr. The role of excited states in softening the ground state with respect to distortions in benzene was demonstrated qualitatively by Longuet- Higgins and Salem by analyzing the œÄ electron levels in the H√ºckel approximation, while a general second-order perturbation formula for such vibronic softening was derived by Bader in 1960. In 1961 Fulton and Gouterman presented a symmetry analysis of the two-level case in dimers and introduced the term \\"pseudo Jahn‚ÄìTeller effect\\". The first application of the PJTE to solving a major solid-state structural problem with regard to the origin of ferroelectricity was published in 1966 by Bersuker, and the first book on the JTE covering the PJTE was published in 1972 by Englman.R. Englman \\"The Jahn‚ÄìTeller Effect in Molecules and Crystals\\", Wiley-Interscience, (1972). The second-order perturbation approach was employed by Pearson in 1975 to predict instabilities and distortions in molecular systems;G. Pearson, \\"Symmetry Rules for Chemical Reactions. Orbital Topology for Elementary Processes\\", Wiley: New York, 1976. he called it \\"second-order JTE\\" (SOJTE). The first explanation of PJT origin of puckering distortion as due to the vibronic coupling to the excited state was given for the N3H32+ radical by Borden, Davidson, and Feller in 1980 (they called it \\"piramidalization\\"). Methods of numerical calculation of the PJT vibronic coupling effect with applications to spectroscopic problems were developed in the early 1980s A significant step forward in this field was achieved in 1984 when it was shown by numerical calculations that the energy gap to the active excited state may not be the ultimate limiting factor in the PJTE, as there are two other compensating parameters in the condition of instability. It was also shown that, in extension of the initial definition, the PJT interacting electronic states are not necessarily components emerging from the same symmetry type (as in the split degenerate term). As a result, the applicability of the PJTE became a priory unlimited. Moreover, it was shown by Bersuker that the PJTE is the only source of instability of high-symmetry configurations of polyatomic systems in nondegenerate states (works cited in Refs.I. B. Bersuker, \\"The Jahn‚ÄìTeller effect\\", Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, 2006.), and degeneracy and pseudodegeneracy are the only source of spontaneous symmetry breaking in matter in all its forms. The many applications of the PJTE to the study of a variety of properties of molecular systems and solids are reflected in a number of reviews and books J. K. Burdett, \\"Molecular Shapes. Theoretical Models of Inorganic Stereochemistry\\", Wiley: New York, 1980.R. Hoffmann, \\"Solids and Surfaces: A Chemist‚Äôs View of Bonding in Extended Structures\\", VCH: New York, 1988.), as well as in proceedings of conferences on the JTE. Theoretical background General theory The equilibrium geometry of any polyatomic system in nondegenerate states is defined as corresponding to the point of the minimum of the adiabatic potential energy surface (APES), where its first derivatives are zero and the second derivatives are positive. If we denote the energy of the system as a function of normal displacements QŒ± as E(QŒ±), at the minimum point of the APES (QŒ±=0), the curvature K of E(QŒ±) in direction Q, K = (d2E/dQŒ±2)0 (1) is positive, i.e., K > 0. Very often the geometry of the system at this point of equilibrium on the APES does not coincide with the highest possible (or even with any high) symmetry expected from general symmetry considerations. For instance, linear molecules are bent at equilibrium, planar molecules are puckered, octahedral complexes are elongated, or compressed, or tilted, cubic crystals are tetragonally polarized (or have several structural phases), etc. The PJTE is the general driving force of all these distortions if they occur in the nondegenerate electronic states of the high-symmetry (reference) geometry. If at the reference configuration the system is structurally unstable with respect to some nuclear displacements QŒ±, than K < 0 in this direction. The general formula for the energy is E = <œà0Hœà0>, where H is the Hamiltonian and œà0 is the wavefunction of the nondegenerate ground state. Substituting E in Eq.(1), we get (omitting the Œ± index for simplicity) K=K0 \\\\+ Kv (2) K0=<œà0(d2H/dQ2)0œà0> (3) Kv=-Œ£n<œà0(dH/dQ)0œàn>2/[En-E0] (4) where œàn are the wavefunctions of the excited states, and the Kv expression, obtained as a second order perturbation correction, is always negative, Kv<0\\\\. Therefore, if K0>0, the Kv contribution is the only source of instability. The matrix elements in Eq. (4) are off- diagonal vibronic coupling constants, F0n= <œà0(dH/dQ)0œàn> (5) These measure the mixing of the ground and excited states under the nuclear displacements Q, and therefore Kv is termed the vibronic contribution. Together with the K0 value and the energy gap 2‚àÜ0n=En-E0 between the mixing states, F0n are the main parameters of the PJTE (see below). In a series of papers beginning in 1980 (see references in ) it was proved that for any polyatomic system in the high-symmetry configuration K0>0, (6) and hence the vibronic contribution is the only source of instability of any polyatomic system in nondegenerate states. If K0 >0 for the high-symmetry configuration of any polyatomic system, then a negative curvature, K =(K0 \\\\+ Kv)< 0, can be achieved only due to the negative vibronic coupling component Kv, and only if Kv> K0. It follows that any distortion of the high-symmetry configuration is due to, and only to the mixing of its ground state with excited electronic states by the distortive nuclear displacements realized via the vibronic coupling in Eq. (5). The latter softens the system with respect to certain nuclear displacements (Kv<0), and if this softening is larger than the original (nonvibronic) hardness K0 in this direction, the system becomes unstable with respect to the distortions under consideration, leading to its equilibrium geometry of lower symmetry, or to dissociation. There are many cases when neither the ground state is degenerate, nor is there a significant vibronic coupling to the lowest excited states to realize PJTE instability of the high-symmetry configuration of the system, and still there is a ground state equilibrium configuration with lower symmetry. In such cases the symmetry breaking is produced by a hidden PJTE (similar to a hidden JTE); it takes place due to a strong PJTE mixing of two excited states, one of which crosses the ground state to create a new (lower) minimum of the APES with a distorted configuration. The two-level problem The use of the second order perturbation correction, Eq. (4), for the calculation of the Kv value in the case of PJTE instability is incorrect because in this case Kv>K0, meaning the first perturbation correction is larger than the main term, and hence the criterion of applicability of the perturbation theory in its simplest form does not hold. In this case, we should consider the contribution of the lowest excited states (that make the total curvature negative) in a pseudodegenerate problem of perturbation theory. For the simplest case when only one excited state creates the main instability of the ground state, we can treat the problem via a pseudodegenerate two-level problem, including the contribution of the higher, weaker-influencing states as a second order correction. In the PJTE two-level problem we have two electronic states of the high-symmetry configuration, ground Œ≤ and excited Œ≥, separated by an energy interval of 2Œî, that become mixed under nuclear displacements of certain symmetry Q=QŒ±; the denotations Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥ indicate, respectively, the irreducible representations to which the symmetry coordinate and the two states belong. In essence, this is the original formulation of the PJTE. Assuming that the excited state is sufficiently close to the ground one, the vibronic coupling between them should be treated as a perturbation problem for two near- degenerate states. With both interacting states non-degenerate the vibronic coupling constant F in Eq.(5) (omitting indices)is non-zero for only one coordinate Q=QŒ± with Œ±=Œ≤√óŒ≥. This gives us directly the symmetry of the direction of softening and possible distortion of the ground state. Assuming that the primary force constants K0 in the two states are the same (for different K0 see [1]), we get a 2√ó2 secular equation with the following solution for the energies Œµ¬± of the two states interacting under the linear vibronic coupling (the energy is read off the middle of the 2Œî interval between the initial levels): Œµ¬±= (1/2)Q2¬±[Œî2+F2Q2](1/2) (7) It is seen from this expressions that, on taking into account the vibronic coupling, F‚â†0, the two APES curves change in different ways: in the upper sheet the curvature (the coefficient at Q2 in the expansion on Q) increases, whereas in the lower one it decreases. But until (F2/K0)<Œî the minima of both states correspond to the point Q = 0, as in the absence of vibronic mixing. However, if (F2/K0)>Œî (8) the curvature of the lower curve of the APES becomes negative, and the system is unstable with respect to the Q displacements (Fig. 1). The minima points on the APES in this case are given by ¬±Q0=[F2/K02-Œî2/F2]1/2 (9) From these expressions and Fig. 1 it is seen that while the ground state is softened (destabilized) by the PJTE, the excited state is hardened (stabilized), and this effect is the larger, the smaller Œî and the larger F. It takes place in any polyatomic system and influences many molecular properties, including the existence of stable excited states of molecular systems that are unstable in the ground state (e.g., excited states of intermediates of chemical reactions); in general, even in the absence of instability the PJTE softens the ground state and increases the vibrational frequencies in the excited state. Comparison with the Jahn-Teller effect Fig. 1. Energy profiles in a two-level PJTE (lower - b) versus the JTE (upper - a) in a single distortion coordinate Q. The two branches of the APES for the case of strong PJTE resulting in the instability of the ground state (when the condition of instability (11) holds) are illustrated in Fig. 1b in comparison with the case when the two states have the same energy (Fig. 1a), i. e. when they are degenerate and the Jahn‚ÄìTeller effect (JTE) takes place. We see that the two cases, degenerate and nondegenerate but close-in-energy (pseudodegenerate) are similar in generating two minima with distorted configurations, but there are important differences: while in the JTE there is a crossing of the two terms at the point of degeneracy (leading to conical intersections in more complicated cases), in the nondegenerate case with strong vibronic coupling there is an ‚Äúavoided crossing‚Äù or ‚Äúpseudo crossing‚Äù. Even a more important difference between the two vibronic coupling effects emerges from the fact that the two interacting states in the JTE are components of the same symmetry type, whereas in the PJTE each of the two states may have any symmetry. For this reason the possible kinds of distortion is very limited in the JTE, and unlimited in the PJTE. It is also noticeable that while the systems with JTE are limited by the condition of electron degeneracy, the applicability of the PJTE has no a priori limitations, as it includes also the cases of degeneracy. Even when the PJT coupling is weak and the inequality (11) does not hold, the PJTE is still significant in softening (lowering the corresponding vibrational frequency) of the ground state and increasing it in the excited state. When considering the PJTE in an excited state, all the higher in energy states destabilize it, while the lower ones stabilize it. Fig. 2. Illustration of the origin of the PJTE in terms of added covalence bonding by distortion: (a) when the Fe atom in metalloporphyrins is in the porphyrin-ring in-plane position, the net overlap of its dz2 orbital with the near-neighbor nitrogen pz orbitals is zero by symmetry, and these orbitals do not contribute to the bonding; (b) the out-of-plane displacement of Fe results in their non-zero overlap producing a covalence contribution to the bonding For a better understanding it is important to follow up on how the PJTE is related to intramolecular interactions. In other words, what is the physical driving force of the PJTE distortions (transformations) in terms of well-known electronic structure and bonding? The driving force of the PJTE is added (improved) covalence: the PJTE distortion takes place when it results in an energy gain due to greater covalent bonding between the atoms in the distorted configuration. Indeed, in the starting high-symmetry configuration the wavefunctions of the electronic states, ground and excited, are orthogonal by definition. When the structure is distorted, their orthogonality is violated, and a nonzero overlap between them occurs. If for two near-neighbor atoms the ground state wavefunction pertains (mainly) to one atom and the excited state wavefunction belongs (mainly) to the other, the orbital overlap resulting from the distortion adds covalency to the bond between them, so the distortion becomes energetically favorable (Fig. 2). Applications Examples of the PJTE being used to explain chemical, physical, biological, and materials science phenomena are innumerable; as stated above, the PJTE is the only source of instability and distortions in high-symmetry configurations of molecular systems and solids with nondegenerate states, hence any phenomenon stemming from such instability can be explained in terms of the PJTE. Below are some illustrative examples.  Linear systems  PJTE versus Renner‚ÄìTeller effect in bending distortions. Linear molecules are exceptions from the JTE, and for a long time it was assumed that their bending distortions in degenerate states (observed in many molecules) is produced by the Renner‚ÄìTeller effect (RTE) (the splitting of the generate state by the quadratic terms of the vibronic coupling). However, recently it was proved (see in the review ) that the RTE, by splitting the degenerate electronic state, just softens the lower branch of the APES, but this lowering of the energy is not enough to overcome the rigidity of the linear configuration and to produce bending distortions. It follows that the bending distortion of linear molecular systems is due to, and only to the PJTE that mixes the electronic state under consideration with higher in energy (excited) states. This statement is enhanced by the fact that many linear molecules in nondegenerate states (and hence with no RTE) are, too, bent in the equilibrium configuration. The physical reason for the difference between the PJTE and the RTE in influencing the degenerate term is that while in the former case the vibronic coupling with the excited state produces additional covalent bonding that makes the distorted configuration preferable (see above, section 2.3), the RTE has no such influence; the splitting of the degenerate term in the RTE takes place just because the charge distribution in the two states becomes nonequivalent under the bending distortion. Peierls distortions in linear chains. In linear molecules with three or more atoms there may be PJTE distortions that do not violate the linearity but change the interatomic distances. For instance, as a result of the PJTE a centrosymmetric linear system may become non-centrosymmetric in the equilibrium configurations, as, for example, in the BNB molecule (see in ). An interesting extension of such distortions in sufficiently long (infinite) linear chains was first considered by Peierls.R. E. Peierls \\"Quantum theory of solids\\", Oxford, Clarendon, 1955. In this case the electronic states, combinations of atomic states, are in fact band states, and it was shown that if the chain is composed by atoms with unpaired electrons, the valence band is only half filled, and the PJTE interaction between the occupied and unoccupied band states leads to the doubling of the period of the linear chain (see also in the books ). Broken cylindrical symmetry. It was shown also that the PJTE not only produces the bending instability of linear molecules, but if the mixing electronic states involve a Œî state (a state with a nonzero momentum with respect to the axis of the molecule, its projection quantum number being Œõ=2), the APES, simultaneously with the bending, becomes warped along the coordinate of rotations around the molecular axis, thus violating both the linear and cylindrical symmetry. It happens because the PJTE, by mixing the wavefunctions of the two interacting states, transfers the high momentum of the electrons from states with Œõ=2 to states with lower momentum, and this may alter significantly their expected rovibronic spectra.  Nonlinear molecules and two-dimensional (2D) systems PJTE and combined PJTE plus JTE effects in molecular structures. There is a practically unlimited number of molecular systems for which the origin of their structural properties was revealed and/or rationalized based on the PJTE, or a combination of the PJTE and JTE. The latter stems from the fact that in any system with a JTE in the ground state the presence of a PJT active excited state is not excluded, and vice versa, the active excited state for the PJTE of the ground one may be degenerate, and hence JT active. Examples are shown, e.g., in Refs., including molecular systems like Na3, C3H3, C4X4 (X= H, F, Cl, Br), CO3, Si4R4 (with R as large ligands), planar cyclic CnHn, all kind of coordination systems of transition metals, mixed-valence compounds, biological systems, origin of conformations, geometry of ligands‚Äô coordination, etc., etc. In fact it is difficult to find a molecular system for which the PJTE implications are a priori excluded, which is understandable in view of the mentioned above unique role of the PJTE in such instabilities. Three methods to quench the PJTE have been documented: changing the electronic charge of the molecule, sandwiching the molecule with other ions and cyclic molecules, and manipulating the environment of the molecule.

As mentioned above, there are molecular systems in which the ground state in the high- symmetry configuration is neither degenerate to trigger the JTE, nor does it interact with the low-lying excited states to produce the PJTE (e.g., because of their different spin multiplicity). In these situations the instability is produced by a strong PJTE in the excited states; this is termed ‚Äúhidden PJTE‚Äù in the sense that its origin is not seen explicitly as a PJTE in the ground state. An interesting typical situation of hidden PJTE emerges in molecular and solid state systems with valence half-filed closed shells electronic configurations e2 and t3. For instance, in the e2 case the ground state in the high-symmetry equilibrium geometry is an orbital non-degenerate triplet 3A, while the nearby low-lying two excited electronic states are close-in-energy singlets 1E and 1A; due to the strong PJT interaction between the latter, the lower component of 1E crosses the triplet state to produce a global minimum with lower symmetry. Fig. 3 illustrates the hidden PJTE in the CuF3 molecule, showing also the singlet-triplet spin crossover and the resulting two coexisting configurations of the molecule: high-symmetry (undistorted) spin- triplet state with a nonzero magnetic moment, and a lower in energy dipolar- distorted singlet state with zero magnetic moment. Such magnetic-dielectric bistability is inherent to a whole class of molecular systems and solids. Puckering in planar molecules and graphene-like 2D and quasi 2D systems. Special attention has been paid recently to two-dimensional (2D) systems in view of a variety of their planar-surface-specific physical and chemical properties and possible graphene-like applications in electronics. Similar-to- graphene properties are sought for in silicene, phosphorene, boron nitride, zinc oxide, gallium nitride, as well as in other attractive subjects like 2D transition metal dichalcogenids and oxides, and there is a number of other organic and inorganic 2D and quasi-2D compounds with expected similar properties. One of the main important features of these systems is their planarity or quasi-planarity, but many of the quasi-2D compounds are subject to out-of-plane deviations known as puckering (buckling). It was shown, as expected, that the instability and distortions of the planar configuration (as in any other systems in nondegenerate state) is due to the PJTE. Detailed exploration of the PJTE in such systems allows one to reveal the excited states that are responsible for the puckering, and suggest possible external influence that restores their planarity, including oxidation, reduction, substitutions, or coordination to other species. Recent investigations have also extended to 3D compounds.  Solid state and materials science  Cooperative PJTE in BaTiO3-type crystals and ferroelectricity. In crystals with PJTE centers the interaction between the local distortions may lead to their ordering to produce a phase transition to a regular crystal phase with lower symmetry. Such cooperative PJTE is quite similar to the cooperative JTE; it was shown in one of the first studies of the PJTE in solid state systems that in the case of ABO3 crystals with perovskite structure the local dipolar PJTE distortions at the transition metal B center and their cooperative interactions lead to ferroelectric phase transitions. Provided the criterion for PJTE is met, each [BO6] center has an APES with eight equivalent minima along the trigonal axes, six orthorhombic, and (higher) twelve tetragonal saddle-points between them. With temperature, the gradually reached transitions between the minima via the different kind of saddle-points explains the origin of all the four phases (three ferroelectric and one paraelectric) in perovskites of the type BaTiO3 and their properties. The predicted by the theory trigonal displacement of the Ti ion in all four phases, the fully disordered PJTE distortions in the paraelectric phase, and their partially disordered state in two other phases was confirmed by a variety of experimental investigations (see in ). Multiferroicity and magnetic-ferroelectric crossover. The PJTE theory of ferroelectricity in ABO3 crystals was expanded to show that, depending on the number of electrons in the dn shell of the transition metal ion B4+ and their low spin or high spin arrangement (which controls the symmetry and spin multiplicity of the ground and PJTE active excited states of the [BO6] center), the ferroelectricity may coexist with a magnetic moment (multiferroicity). Moreover, in combination with the temperature dependent spin crossover phenomenon (which changes the spin multiplicity), this kind of multiferroicity may lead to a novel effect known as a magnetic-ferroelectric crossover. Solid state magnetic-dielectric bistability. Similar to the above-mentioned molecular bistability induced by the hidden PJTE, a magnetic-dielectric bistability due to two coexisting equilibrium configurations with corresponding properties may take place also in crystals with transition metal centers, subject to the electronic configuration with half-filled e2 or t3 shells. As in molecular systems, the latter produce a hidden PJTE and local bistability which, distinguished from the molecular case, are enhanced by the cooperative interactions, thus acquiring larger lifetimes. This crystal bistability was proved by calculations for LiCuO2 and NaCuO2 crystals, in which the Cu3+ ion has the electronic e2(d8) configuration (similar to the CuF3 molecule). Giant enhancement of observable properties in interaction with external perturbations. In a recent development it was shown that in inorganic crystals with PJTE centers, in which the local distortions are not ordered (before the phase transition to the cooperative phase), the effect of interaction with external perturbations contains an orientational contribution which enhances the observable properties by several orders of magnitude. This was demonstrated on the properties of crystals like paraelectric BaTiO3 in interaction with electric fields (in permittivity and electrostriction), or under a strain gradient (flexoelectricity). These giant enhancement effects occur due to the dynamic nature of the PJTE local dipolar distortions (their tunneling between the equivalent minima); the independently rotating dipole moments on each center become oriented (frozen) along the external perturbation resulting in an orientational polarization which is not there in the absence of the PJTE  References  Condensed matter physics Inorganic chemistry Solid-state chemistry ","title":"Pseudo Jahn‚ÄìTeller effect"},{"id":"52837605","text":"The Caracol State Park () is a small state park in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. It contains the dramatic Caracol Falls, a major tourist attraction. Location The Caracol State Park is in the municipality of Canela, Rio Grande do Sul. It has an area of . It is from the municipal seat. The park is in the Serra Ga√∫cha in the northeastern part of the state. The average elevation is . The Caracol Fall on the Arroio Caracol has a free fall of , and is the main tourist attraction. History In prehistoric times the region of the park was occupied by Kaingang, collectors of fruit and seeds, and hunters. The first European explorers gave the region the name \\"Canela\\" from a caneleira (cinnamon) tree under which they made their camp. The Wassen family of Germany arrived in 1863 and began farming and raising livestock. The area has a pleasant climate and natural beauty of canyons, rivers and waterfalls. Hotels and vacation homes were built in the region, starting in 1900, before the town of Canela had been built. Apart from vacationers, the economy depended on trade in cattle, pigs and their products, which were taken for sale to Porto Alegre and neighboring municipalities. A logging industry developed, exploiting the huge forest of araucaria pines, and accelerated when the railway arrived in 1924. A pulp mill was built beside a tributary of the Arroio Caracol, which crosses the park, affecting the water quality. This and the destruction of the forests drove the tourists away. Many species of animals were also driven out, including the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), which was hunted in the false belief that it killed cattle. The state government declared that the land covered by the park was of public utility in 1954. After legal expropriation the area was transferred in 1968 to the State Tourist Office of Canela. The Caracol State Park was established in 1973 with an area of , of which is state-owned. Environment The climate is temperate, with rain distributed throughout the year. The average temperature is in the summer and in winter, occasionally falling to as low as . Snow falls in July and August. Above the escarpment of the Caracol Falls the vegetation is montane rainforest and araucaria forest. Below the escarpment the vegetation is submontane seasonal deciduous forest. The park also contains savanna grasslands. The araucaria forest was devastated by logging from the 1920s to 1950s, but some specimens with trunks up to in diameter are still found near the edge of the escarpment. The vegetation is now regenerating, and Arauc√°ria angustifolia is forming an emergent stratum above a canopy of trees such as Pinho-bravo, Bugre and Capororoca. The large numbers of visitors create some environmental problems, including destruction of seedlings, litter, and so on. However, generally the environment is recovering and wild animals are returning to their habitats. Areas are set aside for visitors to use for picnics and leisure, and other areas are set aside as refuges. Thousands of tree seedlings have been planted to speed up recovery. The region was recommended for permanent preservation as a refuge for deer, and mainly pre√°s. 30 species of mammals have been recorded, including veado mateiro, bugio-ruivo, gato-do-mato-pequeno, coati, otter and pre√°. 130 species of bird have been recorded. Tourism Sonho Vivo Station The park receives about 2,500,000 visitors annually. It is the most popular tourist destination in the southern region of Brazil after the Igua√ßu National Park. As of 2014 there was an admission fee of R$12 per person. The park provides barbecue grills for visitors in an area with tables and benches, many covered, with nearby toilets. There is a large grassy area for sports. Beside the park entrance there are craft shops, a restaurant and toilets. A cable car provides a panoramic view of the falls. The cable cars have closed cabins and come from Switzerland. They are operated by a private company, and there is a fee for the ride. There are two belvederes from which the waterfall can be viewed, one with free admission, the other slightly higher and with an entrance fee. The glassed-in platform is reached by an elevator. The Ecological Observatory gives one of the best views. There is a stairway with 927 steps leading to the base of the waterfall. The Loboguar√° Project, established in 1991, is based in the park and supports low impact ecological tourism and environmental education. The Loboguar√° Project gives courses on the park's environment, observation, interpretation and practical ecology actions. There are four interpretive trails, a center of environmental education in an old house built of araucaria pine wood by the Wassen family, and an amphitheatre. As of 2014 the environmental center seemed to have been abandoned. The trails are unsuitable for people in poor physical condition, who may instead pay to take the small train ride from the Sonho Vivo Station.

Representing a significant expansion of the Railroad Street Historic District and the St. Johnsbury Main Street Historic District, it captures the historical tension and competition between Main Street and Railroad Street for primacy as the town's most important civic and commercial areas. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The town of St. Johnsbury was settled in the late 18th century, and was at first organized primarily on a high terrace above the Passumpsic River, where its Main Street is now located. This area developed as a residential and civic hub, with some commercial development, in the first half of the 19th century. The arrival of railroad lines in the 19th century prompted major development in the \\"lower district\\", now Railroad Street, as a commercial center organized around the railroads. During the second half of the 19th century this development competed with Main Street for economic primacy, and elements of a commercial corridor began to take grow on Eastern Avenue, the main through road between Main and Railroad Streets. Railroad Street benefited from the ongoing railroad activity, while Main Street benefited in no small measure from the activities of the Fairbanks family, whose Fairbanks Scale Works, located northwest of Main Street on the banks of the Sleepers River, was the town's largest employer. with The historic district is geographically roughly an H shape, reflecting its historical development. The eastern leg is Railroad Street, running north-south from Portland Street to Depot Square. This area includes the Railroad Street Historic District, centered on the junction of Railroad and Eastern, but is primarily extended to the north. The western leg is on Main Street, extending from Mt. Pleasant Street in the north to Vine Street in the south. These are joined by the main east-west through corridor, which includes Eastern Avenue between Main and Railroad, and extends west of Main on Western Avenue to Barker Street. The Railroad Street area has a fine collection of late 19th and early 20th-century commercial architecture, while the Main Street area is more diverse, with a large measure of housing and civic buildings. Fully one quarter of the buildings on Main Street were designed by a single architect, Lambert Packard, who also designed some of the buildings on Railroad Street and Eastern Avenue. The Main Street area is also home to two of St. Johnsbury's best-known institutions, the St. Johnsbury Atheneum, a National Historic Landmark, and the Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium; both of these were created through the philanthropy of the Fairbanks family.

Sweeney Store, Barn, Livery and Hall were a trio of historically important commercial buildings on Vermont Route 105 in East Charleston, Vermont. Dating as far back as 1860, the general store, bank barn, and combination livery and community hall have been a center of community activity since their construction. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Of the three buildings, only the store is still standing. Description and history The J.S. Sweeney Store is located prominently in the center of the village of East Charleston, on the south side of Vermont 105 opposite the village's other principal public building, the Plymouth Congregational Church. It is a 2-1/2 story wood-frame structure, with a front gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade has a wider first floor than second, with a two-story recessed porch extending across its width, supported by square paneled posts with Doric capitals. The porch continues over the left-side extension of the ground floor, where it is sheltered by a shed-roof extension of the main roof. The interior is divided into a retail space on the ground floor, and residences above. with The village of East Charleston was founded on the banks of the Clyde River in 1820, and grew as a small lumber town. Most of the village's 19th-century buildings were destroyed by a fire in 1921, of which only the church and the store now survive. The present store was built about 1880, and is of a style typical for northern Vermont general stores: two stories with the proprietor's residence above the shop, a two-story porch, and modest Greek Revival styling. Other buildings that survived the fire included a c. 1860 bank barn and livery stable, the latter of which had a community hall on the second level. The livery served as a major stop on a stagecoach route, and the hall is documented to have been used for community events and meetings. These buildings were located west of the store; although they survived the 1921 fire, they were demolished sometime after the property was listed on the National Register in 1992.

It is an orally administered inhibitor of ALK and ROS1, two enzymes that play a role in the development of cancer.  Medical uses  Lorlatinib is approved in the US and in Europe for the second- or third-line treatment of ALK-positive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Contraindications  Lorlatinib must not be combined with strong inducers (i.e. activators) of the liver enzymes CYP3A4/5 if it can be avoided, as serious cases of liver toxicity have been observed under combination with the CYP3A4/5 inducer rifampicin. on Lorbrena.  Side effects  The most common side effects in studies were high blood cholesterol (84% of patients), high blood triglycerides (67%), edema (55%), peripheral neuropathy (48%), cognitive effects (29%), fatigue (28%), weight gain (26%), and mood effects (23%). Serious side effects led to dose reduction in 23% of patients and in termination of lorlatinib treatment in 3% of patients.  Interactions  Lorlatinib is metabolized by the enzymes CYP3A4/5. Therefore, CYP3A4/5 inducers such as rifampicin, carbamazepine or St John's wort decrease its concentrations in the blood plasma and can reduce its effectiveness. Additionally, the combination of lorlatinib with rifampicin showed liver toxicity in studies. Inhibitors of these enzymes such as ketoconazole or grapefruit juice increase lorlatinib plasma concentrations, leading to higher toxicity. Lorlatinib is also a (moderate) CYP3A4/5 inducer, so that drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes are broken down more quickly when combined with lorlatinib. Examples include midazolam and ciclosporin. Interactions via other enzymes have only been studied in vitro. According to these findings, lorlatinib may inhibit CYP2C9, UGT1A1 and several transport proteins, induce CYP2B6, and has probably no relevant effect on CYP1A2.  Pharmacology   Mechanism of action  Lorlatinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor of ALK and ROS1 as well as a number of other kinases. It is active in vitro against many mutated forms of ALK. Pharmacokinetics  Lorlatinib is cleaved to the metabolite M8 (top left), which makes up 21% of the circulating substance, and an undetected metabolite (given in brackets). Other phase I metabolites are given in the bottom row. Most of these metabolites, as well as the original substance, undergo glucuronidation. The drug is swallowed in the form of tablets. It reaches highest blood plasma concentrations 1.2 hours after a single dose, or 2 hours after ingestion when taken regularly. Its absolute bioavailability is 80.8%. Intake with fatty food increases its availability by 5%, which is not considered clinically significant. When in the bloodstream, 66% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. Lorlatinib is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Lorlatinib is inactivated by oxidation, mainly through CYP3A4, and by glucuronidation, mainly through UGT1A4. Other CYPs and UGTs play a minor role. Lorlatinib and its metabolites are excreted with a half-life of 23.6 hours after a single dose; 47.7% into the urine (of which less than 1% in unchanged form), and 40.9% into the faeces (9.1% unchanged).  Chemistry  Lorlatinib is a white to off-white powder. It has high solubility in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid and very low solubility at a pH over 4.5.  History   Clinical studies  Several clinical trials are ongoing. A phase II trial comparing avelumab alone and in combination with lorlatinib or crizotinib for non-small-cell lung cancer is expected to be complete in late 2017. A phase II trial comparing lorlatinib with crizotinib is expected to be complete in mid-2018. A phase II trial for treatment of ALK- positive or ROS1-positive non-small-cell lung cancer with central nervous system metastases is not expected to be complete until 2023. Preclinical studies are investigating lorlatinib for treatment of neuroblastoma. In 2017, Pfizer announced that lorlatinib was shown to have activity against lung and brain tumors in people with ALK or ROS1 positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.  Approval  In 2015, FDA granted Pfizer orphan drug status for lorlatinib for the treatment of NSCLC.http://drugspider.com/drug/lorlatinib In 2018, the FDA approved lortalinib for second- or third-line treatment of ALK- positive metastatic NSCLC. In February 2019, the European CHMP of EMA recommended the granting of a conditional marketing authorisation. In May 2019 the European Commission approved lorlatinib for the 28 countries of the EU, also as a second- or third-line treatment.

Early life and education  Layng was born at the Grammar School House, Cumberland Street, Macclesfield, Cheshire; she was the eldest of two daughters of Alfred Edward Freestone Layng and Ada Mary Coates. Alfred Layng was widowed in 1883 and in March 1884 he took up the post of headmaster of King Edward VI School in Stafford, Staffordshire, taking his daughters with him.Gilmore, C.G.

He is primarily known for his multimedia approach including installations, audio works, sculptures, works on paper, real-time activities and his artist books.Fourgeaud, Nicolas. 2010. Vittorio Santoro, La lenteur de l‚Äôesprit. In: art21, Paris, Nr. 25, pp. 9-17, Paris. , PDF  Education  Essentially an autodidact, Santoro has attended the International Center of Photography (NYC) and the programs at Watermill Art Center with Robert Wilson (Long Island, NY).  Work  Plateau (Antim√©ridien/Postm√©ridien), 2016, Sculpture Santoro initially developed a literary practice in Italian (his parents emigrated from Sicily, Italy, to Switzerland before his birth.) In 1985, he published the collection of poems entitled La Voce e le Mani, Progetto per una poesia inumana (Lalli Editore, Poggibonsi). His work with the medium of language continues to this day and was even reinforced after meeting with artist Jenny Holzer in the early 1990s. In the mid-1990s, he increasingly turned to photography as a means of expression.Groos, Ulrike. 2006. Between ‚ÄúMerely‚Äù Seeing and ‚ÄúAlready‚Äù Reading. In: Vittorio Santoro, Everything‚Äôs Not Lost, Revolver, pp. 31-34, Frankfurt a. Main. In close collaboration with the American writer Paul Bowles, he publishes The Time of Friendship / Ten Photographs (Memory/Cage Editions, Zurich, 1995). He then gradually expanded the spectrum of media towards sculpture, installation and video/film. Images, space, signs, sounds and language are intertwined in works such as F. Dostoyevsky: C. and P., Page 67 (Penguin Popular Classics), divided vertically, 2007/2011, Untitled (Mask), 2007, Monologism As Poetry, 2009, Reciprocal Scrutiny (bordereau), 2009, Gagarin, I-II, 2012, Good-bye Darkness, IV, 2010, and In/Voluntary Movement Diagram (Josef K.), 2014.Fl√ºckiger, Gabriel. 2014. Vittorio Santoro. In: Kunstbulletin, N¬∞5/14, p. 73, Zurich. His works are based in everyday observations, but go beyond them to show latent historical, aesthetic, sociopolitical, or even metaphysical realities. His characteristically intricate visual sensibility conceals a tension between the referential possibilities of objects and the choreographic nature of their placement in context. For each work Santoro chooses specific ways to manipulate conventions to desired effects believing that creativity is an ongoing process of continual change and reaction. In an artist statement for the installation Reciprocal Scrutiny (bordereau), 2009, shown at Galerie Xippas in Paris, the artist has stated: ‚ÄúI like to think that the different elements of the work will serve as triggers and incite the viewer to form connections between the literary, political, historical and perceptual sources. And, furthermore, encourage a rigorous parlay between one‚Äôs own subjectivity and an ‚Äòimpassive‚Äô art object. This interplay between abstract data, geometric and linguistic forms, historical facts and fictional information can be negotiated and interpreted in any number of ways. I would enjoy that the piece would dilate like a web of associations, interferences and allusions. The center of the project space remains empty and my interest is to explore what, in this vacuum, might now be possible.‚Äù Artist's statement, 2009, official website, PDF In 2017, it was nominated for the prestigious Prix Marcel Duchamp 2017. He proposes the installation Une porte doit √™tre ouverte ou non ferm√©e, 2017, presented at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. It is a sort of initiation ritual itinerary in two parts; one at the museum the other disseminated through elements in the city. The viewer is invited to experience the piece in a quest for its relationship to the world and to itself. His work is represented by Counter Space, Zurich.

It was the 1930s that was the decade in which many common plastics were discovered, some in the UK. On 27 March 1933 Reginald Gibson and Eric Fawcett (with Francis Arthur Freeth FRS and Sir Michael Perrin) discovered polyethylene (polythene) at ICI's Winnington Research Laboratory at Winnington, Cheshire; John Crawford, at the Explosives group of ICI at Ardeer, North Ayrshire near Stevenston, produced a commercial synthesis of poly(methyl methacrylate), also known as Perspex with production beginning in 1934. Polythene is the world's most widespread polymer, and was first produced by ICI from 1939; many plastic bottles are made from LDPE. Polystyrene was invented in Germany in 1937. PTFE was discovered in America (New Jersey) in 1938 by Roy J. Plunkett when at DuPont. PET beverage bottles were introduced from 1973. PEEK was developed by ICI in 1977.

The opening event was devised by creative director Sean McAllister and writer Rupert Creed. It consisted of installations in eight locations across the city of Hull and marked the beginning of the city's period as UK City of Culture, a four-yearly event. By the end of the opening event on 7 January, over 300,000 people were reported to have visited the event and positive reactions were reported in national and local media. Locations during the opening event The headline location was a multimedia sound and light installation in Hull's Queen Victoria Square, entitled We Are Hull and devised by Zsolt Balogh with a soundtrack by Dan Jones.Part of the We Are Hull installation projected onto Hull City Hall * On Whitefriargate, a main shopping street running from Queen Victoria Square, were a number of shop window installations including a recreation of a family caravan holiday, a recreation of a well known second hand and gift shop from the city, and a fake news agents - the Amuse Agents - assembled by Preston Likely and featuring adverts and flyers for fake events with many in-jokes for Hull residents.

On 8 January 2017, a rotor-bade was installed in Queen Victoria Square as part of the Look Up series of installations. The blade was manufactured by Siemens at its factory on Alexandra Dock, Hull and was in place until 18 March. The installation, known as Blade, was not announced in the programme and was a surprise to the general public until the small hours of Sunday 8 January, when the giant artefact was slowly driven through the centre of the city and put in place. In an installation devised by artist Nayan Kulkarni, the blade is set at an angle so that the tip is above the ground, allowing double decker buses to pass underneath. The installation was the first in a series to be known as Look Up, a programme of temporary artworks created for the city‚Äôs public spaces and places. After the blade was installed in Victoria Square it was discovered that there was no planning permission for the structure, required because it was to be in place for more than 28 days. City of Culture chief executive Martin Green said that because the installation was a surprise it had been agreed that planning permission would be sought retrospectively. Bowhead Throughout the initial three-month season, Hull Maritime Museum displayed a multimedia installation depicting a Bowhead whale (otherwise known as a Greenland Right Whale.) The installation was designed by students from Hull School of Art and Design with music by students from Hull University. The installation brought visitors face to face with a digitally rendered whale as if they were looking through the screens of the exhibit into the whales' habitat. Whaling was once an important part of the economy of Hull, and this event was a nod towards that heritage. The City Speaks This is an interactive light artwork that is installed on the River Hull tidal barrier. Members of the public speak into a microphone and their words are transcribed onto the west tower of the barrier. Creative Communities Programme Melville Street flats illuminated for I Wish To Communicate With You As well as the many projects commissioned from professional artists, the whole City of Culture year supported sixty community projects encouraging local people and groups to develop their own events and work. During the first season one of the most dramatic was an installation called I wish to communicate with you which simply placed coloured filters into the lights of blocks of flats, transforming them into a large scale light installation. Weeping Window The second temporary installation in Queen Victoria Square is Weeping Window a sculpture featuring thousands of ceramic poppies cascading from a window of the Maritime Museum. It commemorates those who died in the First World War and especially those in the Merchant Navy and Royal Navy. The artist was Paul Cummins, designed by Tom Piper, and was officially opened on 25 March 2017. The installation is part of the Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red on display at The Tower of London in 2014.  Press coverage  By the end of the opening event on 7 January, over 300,000 people were reported to have visited the event and positive reactions were reported in national and local media. The day after the opening, some tabloid newspapers chose to focus on isolated examples of bad behaviour seen by their reporters, instead of on the actual launch event. These reports led to a swift rebuttal by local sources, including the police commander who reported that there had been no arrests, injuries or serious incidents.

This can either occur during the private phase of these unicorn companies, or in an initial public offering. A unicorn company being one which is valued at, or above, $1 billion US dollars. Factors of bubble growth This increase in billion dollar startups is due to investors' readiness to funnel money into equity holdings in startups, with the total investment by venture capital firms rising from $68 billion in 2014 to $77.3 billion in 2015, and from $48 billion in 2014. Venture capitalists and academics are warning that given the lack of change in startup's overall profitability and future cash flows, the rise in valuations are unsustainable and unjustified. Startups are performing financially the way they always used to, but with greater resources. For example, a Harvard survey of venture capitalists found 91% of venture capitalists think that unicorns are overvalued. The efficiency in the use of the resources therefore is diminished and signals lower profitability for the future. These higher burn rates leading to lower profitability will decrease investors' gains in the next 5 to 10 years. The negative impact on venture capital firms will leave investors less inclined to further invest and invest in new companies. This decline is already manifesting itself in the number of startups with unicorn status and the total valuation of unicorns. Growth in recent years The number of unicorns worldwide has more than doubled since 2015 with a total of 87 at the end of 2015 and 208 at the end of 2016. After doubling from 2014 to 2016, the number of unicorns peaked and 2016 saw a dip relative to 2015 of 21 unicorn startups, 21 out of 208 representing a decline of more than 10%. The total valuation dropped from $1.3 trillion to $761 billion signifying a 41% decrease in value in the startup economy. The warnings and risk mitigating attitude led by prominent sources in the venture capital industry such as Y Combinator and Andreessen Horowitz have led to more strictly measured investment strategies. United States The United States has the largest startup economy in the world with over 400,000 new companies created each year which makes it the most susceptible and the driver of the startup bubble. 14% of Americans in the labor force work for small or startup businesses. A shrinkage of this sector of the economy would impact 27 million Americans. While these numbers mean that entrepreneurship has brought about millions of jobs and has strengthened the US economy relative to the rest of the world, the size of the sector means that the Unicorn Bubble could harm millions of employees. Asia The Asian startup ecosystem is the fastest- growing in the world. $42 billion were invested by venture capital firms and the main entrepreneurship hubs in India and China had 10% growth in startups and 50% growth in venture capital activity respectively. The US is investing dozens of billions into Asian startups and vice versa. Given the global flow of startup investments, a slowdown in the US or Asian startup world will cause a slowdown for the other region as well. Potential aftermath If the startup ecosystem and venture capital industry are indeed in a bubble, the collapse of the bubble would come about due to underperformance of unicorns invested in, leading to reduced profits for venture capital companies. The reduced profitability will lead to less means and inclination of investors to fund startups and an overall less startup-friendly economy. Primarily, this will hurt the startups and venture capital institutions as well as their employees. However, less investment and less interest in founding new companies will also hurt worldwide economic growth and innovation in the near future. Prevention Increased moderation in funding from venture capitalists and angel investors as well a focus on frugality from startup teams are widely accepted as a solution the startup bubble. The underlying reason for the bubble lies in rapidly rising average valuations and funding activities, while most startups remain unprofitable. This cannot be changed. Most startups will always be unprofitable at the point of funding and use funding to increase revenues and more importantly profitability. However, it is possible to reduce risk for venture capital companies and mitigate factors contributing to the bubble by being less generous in deal sizes and using stricter measures when providing valuations. In addition, reducing burn rates is key to startups' overall stability and ability to live up to expectations.

Following the 2015 extended play, CollXtion I. CollXtion II is the second of a planned five CollXtions, following CollXtion I, each being a unique multimedia experience that will include GIFs (particularly called \\"X Visuals\\"),http://alliex.com/gif which are featured in her YouTube videos, a comic detailing an abstract autobiography, and song stems to allow fans to make their own creations.  Background  CollXtion II had been teased by Allie X since the original release of CollXtion I. One of the first statements mentioning the album was made on Twitter, following the release of the song \\"Never Enough\\", which fans assumed would be the lead single. On 3 February 2016, the song \\"Old Habits Die Hard\\" was released, originally as a non-album single available for free download, but was later included in the album's tracklist, as Allie X had promised to include the song once it hit 1 million plays on Spotify. During a question and answer session on social media site Tumblr, Allie X stated that the overall theme for CollXtion II would be \\"longing and being lost\\". On 13 May 2016, after the release of \\"Too Much to Dream\\", Allie X announced the project CollXtion II: …Ñnsolved, which saw her release a collection of demos and songs on Spotify over the course of the summer, in order to shortlist the songs her fans wanted to see on CollXtion II. The songs released through the project were \\"Too Much to Dream\\", \\"Purge\\", \\"All the Rage\\", \\"Casanova\\", \\"That's So Us\\", \\"Misbelieving\\" and \\"Alexandra\\" along with the non-album single \\"Old Habits Die Hard\\". Out of these, only \\"Old Habits Die Hard\\", \\"Casanova\\" and \\"That's So Us\\" were remastered and included on the album's final track list. The project officially ended on 6 November 2016.  Composition  The album opens with \\"Paper Love\\", a mid-tempo synthpop song. Allie X stated that the reason behind the song being the first track on the album is because she felt as if it was a great introduction. \\"It feels like the beginning of something exciting,\\" she stated in a video released on YouTube, in which she breaks down the creation of \\"Paper Love\\". \\"Paper Love\\" is lyrically about a lover, who is perceived as the right one, but ends up being not the person they once seemed to be, yet the love towards them doesn't want to die. \\"['Paper Love' is about] when you find yourself getting into [a romantic situation] that you know will rip you up and you do it anyway,\\" Allie X said about the single. \\"[The term] 'paper love' [means] the kind of love that is too fragile and violent to work but still feels smooth and sexy and sharp and you can't help going forward with it. Like, 'Watch my heart turn to pulp!' It's like knowing [a situation] is going to hurt so good.\\" The song includes a drop, built around a guitar riff and a whistle tone. \\"When I started to make a demo around the riff, I really started to hear a more modern [percussion], the kind of dancehall thing that's happening a lot in music,\\" she said about the composition of the track. \\"I really liked the idea of having a drop, I've never really done a proper drop in any of my songs before.\\" Allie X describes the album's tracks as representing pieces of her. \\"Whether it'd be a dream, a fantasy or my interpretation of reality,\\" she said about the tracks. \\"Paper Love\\" and many of the other songs are about that part of myself that is kind of impulsive and self-destructive, and the kind of guys I dated for a while. I know that now that I'm older a lot of that I've grown out of, but other parts I haven't [grown out of] so much. It definitely is a piece of the me that I am now.\\"  Release and promotion  On 23 February 2017, Allie X announced that the album would be released on 9 June 2017. She also stated she would be embarking on a tour, preceding the album's official release. Dates were announced in New York City, Toronto, Chicago, Los Angeles and London. Due to popular demand from fans, she later added Paris and Milan to the roster. Before the announcement of the release date, Allie X opened a CollXtion II hotline, which would play snippets of certain songs on the album to anyone who called. The first snippet played was \\"Paper Love\\", followed by \\"Need You\\", \\"True Love Is Violent\\" and \\"Simon Says\\".  Singles  \\"Old Habits Die Hard\\" was released as the lead single on February 6, 2016. It was originally never intended to act as the lead single and would instead be a standalone single that wasn't not included on the CollXtion II: …Ñnsolved tracklist, but after the release of CollXtion II: …Ñnsolved, it was released as the lead single of CollXtion II. Which meant that ‚ÄúOld Habits Die Hard‚Äù along with \\"That's So Us\\" and ‚ÄúCasanova‚Äù were the only songs that were remastered, with all three having their original versions and album reworked versions being released as the first, second and fifth singles off of CollXtion II. Upon the release, it garnered critical acclaim from critics. \\"That's so Us\\" was released on September 16, 2016 as the second single. It was met with positive reviews upon release. Originally included on CollXtion II: …Ñnsolved along with \\"Casanova\\", but both were later remastered and released as official singles off of CollXtion II. \\"Paper Love\\" was the album's third single, which was released digitally on 28 April 2017. Avery Stone from Noisey gave the track a favourable review, describing Allie X as \\"sugary-voiced\\", saying she doesn't \\"dwell on it\\". \\"Instead, the track surges forward with a whistling hook over a slinky, swaggering guitar riff‚Äîand you want more. The song echoes the situation‚Äîyou're right back where you started.\\" \\"Need You\\" was released as the forth single from the album on 26 May 2017. The song includes the guest collaboration of Michigan-based band Valley Girl. It was launched as instant grat with the pre-order of the album on May 26. The finalized version of \\"Casanova\\" was packaged together with pre-orders of the album, which began on 23 February 2017 and was widely misreported as the album's lead single. It was later released as the fifth official single from the album, in a new version featuring American singer V√©rit√©. A piano demo was included on the set of CollXtion II: …Ñnsolved along with \\"That's So Us\\" but we're both remastered and released as official singles off of CollXtion II along with \\"Old Habits Die Hard\\" after the release of CollXtion II: …Ñnsolved.

Geologically these highlands are described as a horst and are sometimes referred to as the Danakil Horst or Danakil Block. They were formed by geological faulting which has occurred since the Miocene epoch. There is Precambrian basement rock underlying the region and in coastal Eritrea Precambrian and Mesozoic rocks are exposed. The basement rock of the alps has become overlaid with flood basalt since the Oligocene epoch. About 20 million years ago the Afar rift zone opened up. This resulted in the alps breaking away from the Ethiopian plateau to which they had previously been attached and drifting to the east/northeast. The Danakil Alps contains many volcanic edifices, such as those forming the Nabro Volcanic Range. The largest of the Nabro Volcanic Range edifices are the Mallahle, Nabbro, and Dubbi.

Retrieved 10 January 2017. It is a heat pipe technology demonstrator in which the heat pipes contain low toxicity fluid. Thermal Exchange has been designed by Argotec in collaboration the Italian Space Agency (ASI). Polytechnic University of Turin participated in the project with the development of a prototype of the electronics and software. On April 4, 2016, the experiment was conducted nominally on board the International Space Station by the American astronaut Timothy Kopra.\\"The experiment ARTE successfully conducted on board of ISS\\" (Press Release).

Blog NASA Gov ‚Äì 4 April 2016. Retrieved 10 January 2017.  History  In 2012 Argotec started research in the field of passive heat transfer for the internal development of a device called a heat pipe. This technology is known in the scientific field, but at the moment in Europe there are very few producers and Italy is limited to the purchase of foreign products. Argotec developed a numerical model in order to design a device that can maximize the performance thanks to the optimal combination of external geometry (diameter and length of the tube) and internal geometry (grooves). On board the International Space Station, heat transfer is mainly performed by active systems. Regarding heat removal, internal loops have been installed that collect heat generated by crew and equipment. They transport the heat to external loops, which then transfer the heat to surface (radiators) from which it is radiated towards deep space. The active systems are able to work across a range of operating powers because the application parameters can be changed during the operations by a controller. On the other hand, they have complexity that in space is often reflected in a greater involvement of resources (mass and time of the astronaut) and in a higher probability of malfunction. The goal is then to design a competitive system in terms of performance that is also as simple as possible. Therefore, the ARTE project was born in order to realize a new payload: Thermal Exchange. The goal is to test heat pipes on board the ISS. The fluids selected are low toxicity fluids: this is the reason why these fluids can be used inside the Internal Space Station in which astronauts work. At the moment, some heat pipes are currently used on the ISS but they are installed externally because they contain ammonia. If this fluid were used for internal devices, in the event of a leak it would create a catastrophic hazard to the astronauts. Additionally, a leak could cause a permanent loss of one or more ISS modules. On March 23, 2016, Thermal Exchange arrived on board the International Space Station delivered by the Cygnus (spacecraft) CRS OA‚Äì6, an Orbital/ATK vehicle. The experiment was conducted by the American astronaut Timothy Kopra on April 4, 2016.\\"ARTE: next stop International Space Station\\" (Press Release). Argotec. 23 March 2016. Retrieved 10 January 2017.ASI: \\"Thermal exchange experiment\\" ‚Äì 23 March 2016. Retrieved 10 January 2017. The same as ISSpresso, the Argotec team supported operations from their Mission Control Centre. Thermal Exchange was utilized again by the Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli during his VITA mission started on July 28, 2017. On September 14, 2016 at 11.30, Italian hour, the Italian astronaut successfully conducted this experiment onboard the International Space Station.  Objectives  During extensive research lasting 4 years, Argotec developed an internal numerical model able to identify the best geometry for heat pipe internal grooves provided the thermal operating range. The model has been validated both with a campaign of analysis and tests on Earth, and with the experiment conducted on board the Station. Thanks to the tests done on board the International Space Station, proprietary heat pipes have been qualified for use in Space. A long term objective is the design of a system of heat pipes containing fluids of low toxicity more efficient than an active system that is currently used on the ISS. It is not only space that benefits from research conducted on heat pipes: thanks to ARTE two patents were filed for technologies used on Earth and they have started new heat exchange projects, one of them is called \\"HEAT\\" project.  Design and qualification  After the selection of the optimal geometry for the heat pipes, and the most appropriate fluids for the particular conditions on the Station, the engineers worked on the design of a payload able to independently carry out an experiment on board the ISS. The availability of resources in terms of power on the International Space Station was very important to the selection of the fluids. In fact, the payload was installed inside the Microgravite Science Glovebox (MSG), a glove box containing a cooling plate used to collect the heat carried by the heat pipes during the experiment. As with every project for the ISS, the Thermal Exchange design has found applicable the requirements as defined by the NASA ISS program. The engineers conducted reviews with the ISS Payload Safety Review Panel to demonstrate the payload met the safety requirements with respect to the astronauts and the ISS systems. A sequence of tests has been performed to demonstrate the compatibility with the MSG at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama. The data collected during the tests performed inside the MSG mockup represent part of the Baseline Data Collection (BDC) that the team created to define heat pipe performance. The analysis of the data obtained on board increases the knowledge of the behaviour of heat pipes, and it has resulted in articles for scientific publication. Some publications have already been presented to the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) (2014 and 2015) and AIDAA (2015) conferences.

It is an inhibitor of Lyn and Bcr-Abl. It reached phase II clinical trials in 2010.  Development  Imatinib was the first Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitor and was highly successful in treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, which had previous had no effective treatment. With the emerging resistance to imatinib treatment, alternative treatment was highly sought after. Bafetinib was created as an attempt for a more potent drug than imatinib, with efficacy against various point mutations in the Bcr-Abl kinase, with fewer adverse effects and with narrower kinase spectra, namely just Lyn and Bcr-Abl. In the search for a substance that fit the criteria mentioned, the crystal structure of imatinib bound to Abl was examined. This revealed a hydrophobic pocket around the phenyl ring adjacent to the piperazinylmethyl group of imatinib. Attempts to utilize this pocket to increase efficacy led to the addition of various hydrophobic groups including single fluoro, bromo and chloro substituents. Finally a trifluoromethyl group at position 3 was found to give the best results, with approximately 36-fold improvement over imatinib. The addition of a hydrophobic group now needed to be countered to sustain the solubility of the substance. Closer examination of the crystal structure of imatinib-kinase complex revealed Tyr-236 was in close proximity to the pyridine ring of imatinib, suggesting there was little or no room for a larger group there. With that in mind a more hydrophilic pyrimidine ring was substituted for the pyridine, which was found to increase solubility while leaving efficacy the same or even slightly greater. Finally to improve the hydrogen bonding of the piperazine ring of imatinib with Ile-360 and His-361, pyrrolidine and azetidine derivatives were introduced. The most promising substance from these final modifications was labeled NS-187. The FDA granted NS-187 orphan drug status in 2007 for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Binding Bafetinib in its binding site Due to the structural similarities of imatinib and bafetinib, their binding to Bcr-Abl is also quite similar. The only notable difference comes from the hydrophobic interaction between the trifluoromethyl group and the hydrophobic pocket created by Ile-293, Leu-298, Leu-354, and Val-379. This group can also be linked to bafetinib's specificity for Lyn, as the binding site there is almost identical to that on Bcr-Abl. Bafetinib is effective both against most imatinib resistant mutations (not including T315I) and some dasatinib resistant mutations. Bafetinib also has more affinity for Bcr-Abl than nilotinib (but less than dasatinib) but only targets Bcr-Abl and Src family kinases Lck and Lyn; with unrivalled specificity which suggests the probability of fewer adverse effects.  Clinical trials  Bafetinib was in phase II clinical trials for treatment of leukemia in 2010.

It has spring blooming flowers that come in shades from burgundy, dark brown to dark violet and purple. They have yellow or dark 'beards' and flower over sword-like grey-green leaves. It is normally found in the desert sands between the countries of Jordan and Israel. Description I. petrana has a small brown rhizome. It has waxy, sword-like leaves that are greyish green. These may reach up to tall and can form small low tufts. The plant can reach up to between tall. Normally, the stalk of the plant holds a flower head high above the foliage, raising it to pollenisers. The plant blooms early in the year, between March and April. It also can bloom as early as February, after the spring rains. The large flowers are between in diameter, and come in dark shades ranging from dark brown or burgundy through to dark violetElsa Sattout (UNESCO Office Cairo and Regional Bureau for Science in the Arab States) or dark purple. In certain lights the flowers appears to be nearly black. Like other irises, it has two pairs of petals: three large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls', and three inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The upright standards are obovate or unguiculate (claw-like) in shape, with dark veining. The falls are oblong or ovate shaped with a signal patch that is virtually black. In the middle of the falls, there is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which is mostly orange, yellow, or dark-tipped on a cream ground. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule. The seeds are 3 mm in size and the wind disperses them from the seed capsules. The elaiosome (fleshy coating) of seeds of the iris are rolled by the wind along the soil surface near the plant and collected later by ants. The seeds have arils (a coating) which the ants seem to prefer.Yitzchak Gutterman Biochemistry Most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It was counted in 1980 by Awishai & Zohary. It has a chromosome count of 2n=20. The genetic relationships among seven iris species (Iris germanica, I. petrana, Iris atrofusca, Iris nigricans, Iris vartanii, Iris aucheri and Iris edomensis) were studied by using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Taxonomy It has the common name of Petra iris, and it is written in the Hebrew script as ◊ê◊ô◊®◊ô◊° ◊î◊†◊í◊ë . It is named after Petra (the historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan). Other plants similarly named are Kickxia petrana Danin (now known as Nanorrhinum petranum (Danin) Yousefi & Zarre), and Origanum petraeum Danin. It was found in Ziza, Katrani (about halfway between Ma'an, Syria and Amman) in Palestine, then first described and published by John Edward Dinsmore in Fl. Syria, Palest. & Sinai, Edition 2 on page 599 in 1933. In 1939, it was downgraded and thought to be a synonym of Iris nigricans, but in 1986 Naomi Feinbrun-Dothan in her book Flora Palaestina Vol. 4, she returned it back to a species. This was confirmed by DNA analysis in 2006. They are still sometimes misnamed as I. nigricans (and called the black iris). In the 1970s, a population of irises was found in Yeruham, Israel and botanist Avishay proposed that they were new and named them I. hieruchamensis. He did not formally publish his opinions, and later Feinbrun concluded they were the same species as found in the Negev desert. It is listed in Encyclopedia of Life. and it was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate Asia. Range thumb It is found in southern Jordan, (near the town of Tafilah) and also in Israel, mainly the Negev desert. It is also found on the eastern side of Wadi Araba in the Dead Sea basin (which is between Jordan and Israel).Aziza Chaouni (Editor) Habitat I. petrana grows mainly in the desert, on sandy loess plains and the stabilized sand fields above neogene (created) sandstone. It is also found in the marginal lands by the edge of the desert. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Conservation In Jordan, Iris petrana, Iris atrofusca and Iris vartanii are all threatened species. Since the 1950's, there has been a drastic decline in the population size and the number of iris plants found in the wild. The attractive flowers were picked in the wild, and uncontrolled grazing by animals also damaged plants. In Jordan, various developments have threatened its existence and destroyed various habitats. In Israel, it has been included on the endangered species list. It is included in the Red Book of Endangered Plants in Israel by Avi Schmid, Gadi Polk and Uri Fergman-Sapir. It has now been limited to one region, close to the town of Yeruham. The protected site Yeruham Iris Nature Reserve was created. It covers about 15 acres of almost total desert with just some spring foliage dotted here and there. Within the reserve, controlled grazing by animals has encouraged plant growth, but destructive grazing must be kept to a minimum, especially where the leaves of the irises and flowers have been eaten. It is not on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Synecology Within the Yeruham Iris Nature Reserve, it grows with mounds of Echiochilon fruticosum, the blue Siberian lily Ixiolirion tataricum and a hyacinth relative called Leopoldia longipes subsp. negevensis. It is normally found in groups of plants, with 20 or more flowers, all blooming at the same time. Cultivation It requires well-drained soil and not too much water at any time, especially in the summer (after flowering). If it receives too much water or moisture, it becomes susceptible to various viruses. Propagation Irises can generally be propagated by division, or from seed. Iris atrofusca and I. petrana can also be propagated in vitro from calli from flower bases, leaf bases and anthers. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also, handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske  References  Other sources * Al-Eisawi, D.M., 1986.

The \\"Bell Award\\", given by the American Economic Association each year to economists who promote the success of women in the profession, is named for her.  Personal life and education  Bell grew up in Framingham, Massachusetts and studied economics at Mount Holyoke College. She married, and at the end of the war, both she and her husband moved to London for graduate school. She completed her doctorate at the London School of Economics in 1949, and, newly divorced and the mother of a young daughter, returned to live with her parents. She took a job at nearby Wellesley College. In 1953, she married Nelson Bell, a Wellesley, Massachusetts small business owner. The couple were known for entertaining Wellesley students, and her students were inspired by her example of having both a family and a successful career.  Career   Employment  She took a job as an assistant to John Kenneth Galbraith at the federal Office of Price Administration, responsible for price controls during World War II, after graduating from Mount Holyoke College. She took at job at Wellesley College after receiving her doctorate at the London School of Economics. Bell retired from teaching in 1989, due to hearing loss, but continued writing columns for The Boston Globe until the year 2000.  Author and researcher  Bell wrote two books on consumer economics, Consumer Choice in the American Economy (1967) and The Economics of the Ghetto (1970), as well as numerous journal articles on human capital, income distribution and the economic data. In her role as the founding chair of the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession for the American Economic Association she began surveys of women in the economics profession that continue to the present day. = Selected Works =  *  Mentorship  Bell encouraged many of her Wellesley female students to pursue careers in economics and business, and to tell later students about their successes. Along with fellow economics professor Marshall Goldman, she started the \\"FEM files.\\" These referred to \\"Former Economics Majors,\\" with whom she kept in touch, and asked to describe their experiences to other alumnae of the department. Her encouragement, and the network of alumnae she mentored, helped Wellesley graduates succeed. The model she established sent a disproportionate number of Wellesley graduates into careers in economics and business. At least 58 of her students received doctorates in economics while she was a professor at Wellesley, and another 30 were enrolled in such programs at the time of her retirement.  Advancing women in economics  After a group of graduate students, including Francine Blau and Heidi Hartmann, demanded to know why so few female economists were on the program for the American Economic Association Annual Meetings in 1971, Bell undertook a survey of all the employed female members of the AEA who had completed their graduate degrees at least ten years prior, to demonstrate to AEA president Kenneth Arrow the number of female economists willing and able to present papers at these meetings. Bell was then named chair of a new Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession (CSWEP). Under her leadership CSWEP began surveying graduate programs in economics to find out the numbers of female graduate students and female faculty, to demonstrate the numbers of qualified women for positions in economics. The committee's pressure also led to changes in the job market for economists from networks of male professors to open hiring, including the publication of \\"Job Openings for Economists\\", a public listing of open positions in the field. Bell Award In 1998, as part of the 25th anniversary of CSWEP, the American Economic Association established an annual award named for Carolyn Shaw Bell, given to economists who promote the success of women in this profession.

All Saints‚Äô is part of the Diocese of Newcastle and within the Newcastle Central Deanery. It has served the community of Gosforth since being consecrated in 1887. The building is an example of Gothic Revival architecture constructed between 1885 and 1887. The tower is later, of 1896, and has a ring of ten bells. The interior has Victorian wood carvings by Ralph Hedley, an organ by Harrison & Harrison and stained glass windows depicting the saints throughout the ages. Alongside the church building is an Edwardian church hall, a garden of remembrance and church green. History Various historians have indicated that the parish church of St. Nicholas in South Gosforth was built on the remains of a Saxon Church and is the earliest church in the district. In 1882, the Revd Frederick Wood Bindley, the new vicar of St. Nicholas began major restoration on the church, prompting questions about the size of the parish church. In the nineteenth century the population of the original parish increased from just over a thousand to an estimated six thousand, with the development of farming, mining and trading communities to the west of the Great North Road. A committee was formed to plan the construction of a new church, and William Cochrane, a mining engineer, was appointed as honorary secretary. The church was designed by the diocesan architect Robert J. Johnson and the press claimed that the people of Gosforth could now boast that they possessed ‚Äúone of the finest modern churches in the north of England‚Äù. The church was consecrated as All Saints on 2 October 1887. In later years, All Saints became the mother church of four more churches in Gosforth. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described All Saints as \\"a good, competent example of the large late Victorian ecclesiastical building\\". The church has a Grade II listing.

Swinney served as president of the American Bankers Association and later as president of the First National Bank of Kansas City (now a part of the Bank of America). Swinney served on the Kansas City School Board from 1894 until 1918. Swinney was also a philanthropist who created, in 1944, the Edward F. Swinney Trust whose mission is \\"to be used for the furtherance and development of such public charitable and public educational purposes in the State of Missouri\\". The Swinney Recreation Center bears his name.  Early Life  Swinney was born in Marysville, Virginia on August 1, 1857. He attended Blackburg University from 1872-1875.  Career  Swinney moved to Fayette, Missouri shortly after graduating university to pursue a career in banking. In Fayette, Swinney was hired as a grocery delivery boy, which consisted of long hours and pay of $20 a week. Despite these strenuous working conditions, he kept a positive attitude and developed a work ethic that would attribute to his future successes. After working for the grocery store for about five years, he got a job working for a dry goods store, which gave him a $5 pay raise. On August 15, 1878, Swinney was given the opportunity to work at a bank in Fayette, which launched his career as a successful banker. Swinney worked at the Fayette Bank for four years before he accepted a higher position in Rich Hill, Missouri. Eventually, he was offered the position to become a cashier at their new location in Colorado City, Texas. Swinney returned to Missouri on March 1, 1887, where he became a cashier at the First National Bank in Kansas City, Missouri. He was elected president of the First National Bank in 1890. Swnney quickly built a reputable and respected name for himself within the financial community.  Philanthropy  Swinney was a philanthropist and was involved in many local organizations. He was particularly interested in public education, and he sat on the Kansas City Board of Education from 1894 until 1918. He also funded the Edward F. Swinney Trust, which helps develop public charitable and educational projects in Missouri.  Personal Life  Swinney married his wife, Ida Lee, in Howard County, Missouri on November 14, 1882. The couple had two children, Edna S and Lee Thomson, who were both adopted. Swinney died in his apartment at 8:45am following weeks of health complications.

There is still a low secure unit on site managed by the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust. History The site was selected at Prestwich Woods and acquired from Oswald Milne, a solicitor, in 1847. The hospital was designed by Isaac Holden, a Manchester architect. It was built of red brick with stone quoin decoration and officially opened, with 350 patients, as the Second Lancashire County Lunatic Asylum in January 1851. Two extra wards were completed in 1864 and an annex was built in 1883. By 1903 it was accommodating 3,135 patients making it the largest asylum in Europe. Montagu Lomax, assistant medical officer at the hospital between 1917 and 1919, exposed the inhuman, custodial and antitherapeutic practices there in his book The Experiences of an Asylum Doctor, which led to a Royal Commission, increased central control and ultimately the Mental Treatment Act 1930.BA Towers The management and politics of a public expose: the Prestwich Inquiry 1922 J Social Policy (1984) 13: 41‚Äì61TW Harding, \\"Not worth powder and shot.\\" A reappraisal of Montagu Lomax's contribution to mental health reform British Journal of Psychiatry (1990) 156: 180‚Äì187 The National Asylum Workers' Union organised a strike of 200 employees at the hospital in 1918.

It originally comprised over 50,000 headwords listed in their spelling form, each of which was given one or more pronunciations transcribed using a set of phonemic symbols based on a standard accent. The dictionary is now in its 18th edition. John C. Wells has written of it \\"EPD has set the standard against which other dictionaries must inevitably be judged\\". History The precursor to the English Pronouncing Dictionary was A Phonetic Dictionary of the English Language by Hermann Michaelis and Daniel Jones, published in Germany in 1913. In this work, the headwords of the dictionary were listed in phonemic transcription, followed by their spelling form, so the user needed to be aware of the phonemic composition of a word, in order to discover its spelling. A typical entry, given as an example in the preface, was 'explanation'. The user therefore had to have recognized the phoneme sequence , before they could discover the spelling form of the word. This format did not find favour and a German-British work was in any case not likely to do well at the time of the First World War. * Editions 1 to 13: Jones published the EPD in 1917 with the publishing house Dent. Dent continued to produce the EPD until 1989. Some editions appeared under the title Everyman's English Pronouncing Dictionary. * Edition 14: Jones died in 1967, and the work of editing the EPD was taken up by his pupil Alfred C. Gimson. Since the dictionary was produced by traditional typesetting until the 15th edition, any substantial revision involved considerable work and expense, but Gimson introduced a new style of phonemic transcription for the 14th edition, published in 1977. When the cost of producing a completely new edition was judged prohibitive, a revised version of the 14th with a supplementary annexe adding about 1000 words was published in 1988; Gimson's colleague Susan Ramsaran was his assistant editor for this work and completed it after Gimson's death in 1985. Subsequently, the rights to the EPD were acquired by Cambridge University Press. According to his autobiography, John C. Wells was approached by Dent to succeed Gimson as the editor, only to decline the offer because Dent was \\"not prepared to make the major changes that [Wells] considered necessary\\" and compile an entirely new pronunciation dictionary to be published by Longman. * Editions 15 to 18 (the Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary): Peter Roach became principal editor for the 15th edition. It was decided to add American pronunciations throughout, and James Hartman was appointed the American editor. The publishers moved to computer-based production, using optical scanning and character recognition of the preceding edition to compile a digital database ready for editing. The revision began in 1992, initially with Karen Stromberg as editorial assistant and subsequently with Jane Setter. More than 18,000 words were added and the new (15th) edition was published in 1997. The 16th edition was published in 2003, the 17th in 2006 and the 18th (current) edition in 2011. For the 17th and 18th editions, Jane Setter was one of the editors. For the 18th, John Esling replaced James Hartman as the American editor. In 2015 an electronic version of the 18th edition appeared: this is an app available for use on Apple's iPhone and iPad, sold through the Apple iStore. An Android version appeared in 2017. Model accent All editions have been based on a single accent (or a single American and a single British accent in the case of the 15th to 18th editions). The American accent is named GA (General American), but the British standard accent has been given different names at different times. *SSE ('Standard Southern English', in Michaelis and Jones): \\"The pronunciation represented is that generally used by persons of culture in the South of England. This form of pronunciation is chosen not because it is intrinsically superior to any other, but because it is that generally found most useful by those studying the English language\\" (p vii) *PSP ('Public School Pronunciation', EPD editions 1 and 2): the pronunciation is \\"that most usually heard in everyday speech in the families of Southern English persons whose menfolk have been educated at the great public boarding schools\\". *RP ('Received Pronunciation', EPD editions 3 to 14) *BBC ('BBC Pronunciation', EPD editions 15 to 18) Transcription conventions In all editions the transcription used is essentially phonemic, but the symbols and the conventions for their use have varied from time to time. *Symbols in editions 1-13, edited by Jones: this form of transcription is characterized especially by the use of the length mark (\\"Àê\\") as the sole differentiation between pairs of long and short vowels such as feet and fit, Luke and look (thus ). *The Gimson symbols (14th edition): in this system, there is some redundancy but a clearer demonstration of the phonetic quality of vowels as the long/short vowel pair are distinguished both by symbol shape and by the use of the length mark. Thus feet and Luke are distinguished from fit and look . *Symbols used in 15th to 18th editions: these are essentially the same symbols as those devised by Gimson, but with the addition of the symbol for the \\"happY\\" vowel and the corresponding symbol for an unstressed close back rounded vowel (these symbols are not strictly phonemic). For the representation of American pronunciation the editors devised a transcription that retained a close similarity to the English symbols. However, the GOAT vowel is transcribed for GA; \\"rhotic\\" symbols are used for the vowel in the first syllable of survive and for the vowel in bird . For the benefit of non- American users, the convention of the diacritic is used to indicate probable 'tapping' or 'flapping' of , thus 'better' (again, this is not a strictly phonemic transcription). Audio material At the time of the publication of the 16th edition, a CD-ROM disk (compatible with Windows but not with Apple computers) was produced which contains the full contents of the dictionary together with a recording of each headword, in British and American pronunciation. The recorded pronunciations can be played by clicking on a loudspeaker icon. A \\"sound search\\" facility is included to enable users to search for a particular phoneme or sequence of phonemes. Most of the recordings were made by actors or editorial staff. The recordings were completely revised for the 18th edition.

She also holds a Master of Theological Studies degree from Saint Meinrad Seminary and School of Theology in Saint Meinrad, Indiana, which she completed in 2010. Prunty and her husband, Marshall, have three daughters - Kaci, Lindsay, and Hillary. Marshall Prunty, a doctor, was unsuccessful in three attempts to capture the 15th district seat in the Kentucky House. Prunty was raised in the Methodist church, but converted to Roman Catholicism as an adult. She served as director of the Office of Youth Ministry for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Owensboro, resigning in 2016 to seek public office. Political career In 2016, Prunty filed as a Republican to challenge incumbent Democrat Brent Yonts for his seat representing Kentucky's 15th district in the state House of Representatives. She said her primary impetus for running was the passage of more pro-life legislation. Her other stated priorities as a candidate were to reduce regulations, particularly those affecting small businesses and the coal industry; improving the quality and lowering the cost of healthcare, especially for veterans; reforming adoption law; and strengthening protections for religious freedom and gun rights. In the November 8, 2016, general election Prunty defeated Yonts by a vote of 10,597 to 7,973. Yonts told The Messenger-Inquirer, \\"It wasn't me, it was Trump,\\" noting that over half of the 15th district voted a Republican straight ticket, with presidential candidate Donald Trump at the top of the ballot. Prunty's election was part of a Republican landslide in Kentucky that saw the party take control of the state House for the first time since 1921. Including Prunty, 17 Republican challengers unseated Democratic incumbents in the election, turning a 53-47 Democratic majority into a 64-36 Republican majority.

On December 3, 1993, Mek was murdered in a gang shooting by the Wah Ching gang, at a pool hall in El Monte, California. The murder was caught on camera by four surveillance cameras installed within the hall. After the murder, the Asian Boyz declared war on the Wah Ching. As a result, it influenced a number of other gang murders and shootings in the LA area, and created a strong feud between both Asian gangs. Authorities claim the murder inspired a chain reaction of gang violence which led to ten other murders in the LA area. Murder On Friday, December 3, 1993, 18-year-old Lea Mek, nicknamed \\"Kicker\\", went to a pool hall located in a working-class area in the San Gabriel Valley, in El Monte, California. The pool hall was a hangout spot for the gang he was a part of, the Asian Boyz. Mek carried a .45 caliber pistol with him on the night of the shooting and he had a history of weapons and violence. Not long after his arrival, around twenty members of a rival Asian gang called Wah Ching arrived at the hall. Mek reportedly started \\"mad- dogging\\" them, staring the gang members down and boasting in front of them. He allegedly walked around and flashed his pistol on multiple occasions in an effort to intimidate the rival gangsters. Some of the gangsters left, but a number stayed behind as Mek continued to mock them. Mek turned his back momentarily and was then wrestled to the floor by Wah Ching gang member, 19-year-old Chieu Luong Yang (), nicknamed \\"China Dog\\". Yang wrestled Mek to the floor and he and several other Wah Ching gang members tried to drag Mek outside. Asian Boyz gangsters in the pool hall attempted to help Mek by attacking them with pool cues. One Asian Boyz gangster tried to fire at the Wah Ching with a pistol resting on a pool table, but the gun jammed. Mek was still held down on the floor and his gun was taken from him by Yang. At this point, another Wah Ching gang member entered the hall and opened fire with a pistol, sending people inside the hall running and screaming. People inside the hall took cover behind pool tables, while Mek was dragged outside. Yang peered into the pool hall and opened fire at Asian Boyz gang members with the gun he had stolen from Mek. Mek managed to break free outside and attempted to tackle Yang but failed to do so. He ran into the hall and tried to take cover behind one of the pool tables. Yang however shot at him and followed him into the hall. Mek was shot five times in his body as he took cover behind a pool table. Yang chased after him and fired two shots into Mek's head as he lay on the floor. Yang then fled and Mek died a short time later. Aftermath Officer Greg Carroll from the El Monte Police Department was the first to arrive on scene. The hall still smelt of gunpowder and it was silent inside, with people still cowering behind pool tables in shock over the shooting. At the time of the shooting, the hall was filled with around fifty people, some of whom were children. Four hidden surveillance cameras recorded the incident in black and white. The cameras recorded no audio however. Yang was identified as the killer because of the video tapes and was captured at a later date. He was sentenced to life in prison for the murder. The other shooter was also captured and sentenced to 10 years in jail on condition he plead guilty to the crime, which he did. The murder of Mek is a key incident between the Wah Ching and Asian Boyz. It caused even more tension and rivalry between the two gangs. Authorities claim the murder inspired a chain reaction of gang violence which led to ten other murders in the LA area. Six months later, the Asian Boyz carried out a revenge hit by performing a drive-by shooting on the Wah Ching at a San Marino High School graduation party, which led to the deaths of two Asian youths. In popular culture Footage of the crime has been shown on documentaries and was broadcast widely in the media at the time of the incident. Footage of the murder has been shown on programs such as Gangland, Anatomy of Crime and Banned from Television. Due to there being no audio, sound effects of gunshots were added to the footage.

Cleo is a member of the show's established McQueen family and was introduced as the younger sister of Porsche (Twinnie- Lee Moore) and Celine McQueen (Sarah George), who arrived in late 2014. Actress Jennifer Metcalfe, who plays Mercedes McQueen, suggested that more McQueens should be introduced, as she knew the show was losing two members of the family. Mulkerrin had previously auditioned for the role of Phoebe Jackson, however this role was later given to Mandip Gill. Upon learning she had been cast as Cleo, she gave up her job as a waitress and relocated to Liverpool, where the show is filmed. She made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 26 January 2015. Cleo is portrayed as being studious, sensible and witty. She leaves her boarding school to be with her family in Hollyoaks village. Shortly after, she is given her first love interest in Harry Thompson (Parry Glasspool), who struggles with his sexuality while dating her. Cleo is central to a long-running sexual abuse storyline, in which she is manipulated and abused by her stepfather Pete Buchanan (Kai Owen). The cast and crew worked with child protection charity NSPCC on the storyline, while Mulkerrin met with abuse survivors during her research. During the storyline Cleo is also involved in a car crash stunt, and takes the blame for killing Rachel Hardy (Jennifer Brooke) to protect her friend Holly Cunningham (Amanda Clapham). She later develops feelings for Rachel's fianc√© Nathan Nightingale (Jared Garfield). Cleo's second issue-led storyline saw her taking heroin, following Nathan and Celine's deaths. Producers later paired the character with trainee priest Joel Dexter (Rory Douglas-Speed). The relationship has faced several obstacles, including a motorbike crash, Joel's recommitment to the Church, a kidnapping, and pregnancy. Cleo's third issue- led storyline saw her develop bulimia nervosa in December 2017. For her portrayal of Cleo, Mulkerrin won the Best Newcomer accolade at the 2015 Digital Spy Reader Awards. In 2017, she earned a nomination for Best Female Dramatic Performance at The British Soap Awards. She has been longlisted for Best Actress at the Inside Soap Awards twice. Television critics praised Mulkerrin's performance during the abuse storyline. Others have enjoyed Cleo's relationship with Joel, and one stated she was the best member of the McQueen family. Creation and casting In May 2014, Daniel Kilkelly of entertainment website Digital Spy reported that three new members of the McQueen family were in the process of being cast. The show's executive producer Bryan Kirkwood stated, \\"Towards the end of this year we're going to meet an extended branch of the McQueen family. There are going to be some colourful new faces to help them reclaim their crown at the heart of the show.\\" Kirkwood later explained that the idea for the new McQueens came from actress Jennifer Metcalfe, who plays Mercedes McQueen. She knew the show was losing Mercedes' sister, Carmel McQueen (Gemma Merna), and she herself was taking a break. Kirkwood and Metcalfe are both \\"passionate\\" about the McQueens and looked at other famous soap families, like the Mitchells from EastEnders, and realised there could be many other McQueens out there. Two months later, it was announced that actresses Twinnie-Lee Moore and Sarah George had been cast as Porsche and Celine McQueen, nieces of established character Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber- Lane). Kilkelly's colleague, Sophie Dainty reported that Porsche and Celine would eventually be joined by their younger sister, but casting details had not been confirmed at the time. On 1 January 2015, Kilkelly announced that actress Nadine Rose Mulkerrin had been cast in the role of Porsche and Celine's sister, Cleo McQueen. Mulkerrin gave up her job as a waitress for the part and relocated to Liverpool, where the show is filmed. Mulkerrin originally auditioned for the role of Phoebe Jackson three years prior to securing the part of Cleo, but the role went to Mandip Gill. She later stated that securing the role of Cleo felt like \\"fate\\", as she had been auditioning for the show for a while and wanted to be involved in Cleo's upcoming sexual abuse storyline. Development Characterisation and introduction Describing her character, Mulkerrin stated: \\"Cleo is a typical McQueen ‚Äì she's not usually a rebel. But she's got McQueen blood running through her, so there's a lot more to come from Cleo. Just watch this space!\\" Mulkerrin also said that Cleo was very studious, into her books and also very witty. When asked if she shares any similarities to her character, Mulkerrin admitted that Cleo was smarter than she was, as Mulkerrin is the ditzy member of her friendship group. But she said that they were both sensible and would stay home to revise, while they were in school. The actress also thought Cleo was very different to her sisters, and said that while Cleo loves them, they would often bicker. A writer for the official Hollyoaks website commented that Cleo slowly gets used to living in a house full of \\"alpha females\\" and branded her \\"a drama-free McQueen\\". Mulkerrin added that Cleo would have a \\"turbulent time\\" following her return home to see her family, and would face some old demons. The character's hair is often styled into a bun. In 2017, Mulkerrin branded her character \\"the dreary McQueen\\" and \\"a little nanna\\". An Inside Soap columnist reported that Cleo's introduction would give viewers an insight into Porsche and Celine's backstory and their lives before they moved to the village. Cleo's first scenes saw her arrive in Chester in the back of a van. After leaving her boarding school, Cleo hitches a lift and manages to convince a passing beautician to drive her to Chester, after saying that her sisters would buy some of the beautician's stock. Mulkerrin commented that Cleo arrives in \\"typical McQueen style\\". Porsche and Celine are happy to be reunited with their sister, while Mulkerrin said it was good for Cleo to be with her sisters again, following several tragedies within the family. She also said Cleo had missed Porsche and Celine. Cleo is enrolled at Hollyoaks High and finds herself in trouble with the headmaster Patrick Blake (Jeremy Sheffield) on her first day. Mulkerrin explained that Cleo is \\"really clever\\" and was away on a scholarship, so when she spots Dylan Jenkins (James Fletcher) and Nico Blake (Persephone Swales-Dawson) spray painting a school wall, she points out that they have missed out an apostrophe and adds it in. Patrick catches Cleo and she finds herself in \\"a whole heap of trouble\\". Relationship with Harry Thompson Parry Glasspool (pictured) plays Cleo's first love interest, Harry Thompson. When Harry Thompson (Parry Glasspool) returns to the village in February 2015, he begins a relationship with Cleo. During his first day at Hollyoaks High, Harry befriends Cleo when he needs help. He later flirts with her and Cleo \\"quickly warms to him\\", as she feels flattered by his attentiveness. Shortly after, Harry kisses Cleo's cousin John Paul McQueen (James Sutton) and he struggles with his sexuality. When his friend Zack Loveday (Duayne Boachie) mentions that John Paul has been showing extra attention to him, Harry kisses Cleo in front of their classmates to prove his interest in her. However, an angry Cleo pushes him away and says Harry has made \\"a mockery\\" of her, leaving him to make it up to her. Glasspool thought Harry did genuinely like Cleo, saying \\"She's the first friend he made when he arrived. I think Harry does have feelings for her, but at the same time, you do get a sense that he's using her just to distract people and keep up an image. Harry does seem to be fond of Cleo and he does really like her, but it'll be interesting to see how it works out for both of them. I suppose it is a bit mean leading her on if he's not really interested!\\" With Harry struggling with his sexuality, he realises that he cannot commit to the relationship and breaks up with Cleo, who is \\"distraught\\" by the development. Cleo handles Harry's rejection poorly and hopes that they can sort things out and reconcile. The couple later reunite. When Cleo gets a job at the local coffee shop, she and Harry have a playful whipped cream fight. Her stepfather Pete Buchanan (Kai Owen) sees her with Harry and reports her to Jack Osborne (Jimmy McKenna) for unprofessional behaviour. Cleo suddenly breaks up with Harry and he becomes convinced that she is dating another man. Harry spies on Cleo, but dismisses his suspicions when she meets up with Pete. Cleo's sister Porsche tries to convince her to give her relationship with Harry another chance. She then embarrasses Cleo by attempting to get her and Harry back together, but it does give Cleo a chance to talk with Harry and he agrees to have a coffee with her. Cleo learns that Harry was hurt when she ended their relationship and he thinks that there was more to her reason for the break up. Cleo later spots a \\"half-naked\\" Harry in the street and invites him out for a drink. An Inside Soap writer noted that there was an obvious chemistry between them. During their night out, Cleo suddenly remembers that she has organised a date with her stepfather, ending her chances of reuniting with Harry for good. Sexual abuse On 12 June 2015, Kilkelly (Digital Spy) reported that as part of the show's long-running, issue-led storyline focusing on sexual abuse within the McQueen family, Cleo's stepfather Pete Buchanan (Owen) would form \\"an inappropriate relationship\\" with her. Mulkerrin learned about the storyline during her audition for Cleo and knew it would be \\"pretty heavy\\". The cast and crew worked with child protection charity NSPCC on the storyline and led a campaign titled \\"No More Secrets\\", which encourages victims to speak out. Mulkerrin was passionate about the storyline and wanted to do it justice. She thought that if one person watched the show and decided to speak out, then they had done their job well. On-screen, Cleo's sister Porsche tells her family that Pete sexually abused her when she was 15, but they do not believe her. Pete then reunites with their mother Reenie McQueen (Z√∂e Lucker) and acts as a stepfather to her daughters, which allows him to start manipulating Cleo. Mulkerrin explained that there would multiple layers to Cleo's story and that it would push the boundaries. She continued, \\"Cleo turns 18 during this story, so then it raises questions of whether she's an adult who's consenting to this. It's not as simple as her being abused or being a victim.\\" Kai Owen (pictured) plays Cleo's abusive stepfather, Pete Buchanan. During an interview with Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap, the actress revealed more details on Cleo and Pete's fictional backstory. She explained that Cleo was groomed from the age of thirteen by Pete, which caused her to think that what they have is normal. She thinks that they are in a loving relationship and has no idea that she is being abused. When Ellis pointed out that Cleo appeared reluctant to be alone with Pete, Mulkerrin replied that Cleo is not comfortable with the physical side of their relationship. She continued, \\"She doesn't get any pleasure from having sex with Pete ‚Äì they're not equals like they would be in a normal relationship.\\" When Pete wants to be alone with Cleo, she goes along with it because she loves him and does not want him to leave the family. Mulkerrin also told Ellis that Cleo was very jealous of Pete and Reenie's relationship, and she asks Pete to choose who he wants to be with. Cleo wants their relationship to be public knowledge, but Mulkerrin doubted that she could go through with telling her mother the truth. Pete targets Jade Albright (Kassius Nelson), as he sees that she is also a vulnerable teen that needs \\"rescuing\\". Pete befriends Jade after helping her with her school work and asking about her life. Owen commented that Pete wants to get close to Jade, but he also uses her to make Cleo jealous. When Cleo learns about Pete's new friendship, she confronts him and he \\"brushes it off straight away\\". Pete assures Cleo that Jade is just a child and he was just helping her with her school work. Owen pointed out, \\"We've seen time and time again that Pete can manipulate Cleo and easily get her back onside.\\" Cleo becomes increasingly unsettled by the idea of Pete marrying her mother and wants to tell everyone about their affair. She also feels betrayed by Pete's closeness to Jade and his plans to go through with the wedding. She threatens to reveal their relationship and stop the wedding, so Pete tries to talk her round in an alleyway, but they are seen by Cleo's former boyfriend Harry Thompson. Harry confronts Cleo on her own and she reveals that she is in a relationship with Pete. Shortly after Pete and Reenie are married, Harry interrupts the ceremony and tells everyone the truth about Cleo and Pete. Porsche believes Harry straight away. Pete is later injured in a car accident and Cleo visits him the hospital in secret. She wants \\"to keep that connection going\\" and it shows that Pete still has control over her. She also refuses to talk to the police when Reenie and Porsche invite them to the McQueen home. Harry learns that Cleo is visiting Pete and tells her to stop, but when she ignores his plea, he tells her family. Pete later asks Cleo to get rid of a key he has hidden under a floorboard, and viewers learn that it is for a storage unit where Pete has kept all of the correspondence and photographs documenting their relationship. Mulkerrin told Alison Gardner of What's on TV that Cleo realises that she has been abused when she finds photos of Jade among the items. She confronts Jade at the college and Jade describes how Pete called her special bought her gifts, which is what he did with Cleo. Mulkerrin called the moment that Cleo realises the truth \\"really sad.\\" Pete gets close to Cleo again and they plan to run away together. After receiving good test results, Cleo reconsiders her plan to run away with Pete and asks if they can wait until she has sat her A levels. An angry Pete is not happy with the change of plan. To take her mind off the situation, Cleo attends the Space Ball, while Pete attempts to reach her on her phone. Cleo eventually decides that she should leave with Pete. While she is attending school for the last time, Holly Cunningham (Amanda Clapham) discovers Cleo's passport and travel tickets. She puts them in her locker and refuses to hand them over to Cleo. Pete orders Cleo to get the documents back and their conversation is overheard by Nathan, who warns Holly. However, they discover Cleo has already broken into Holly's locker and taken back the documents. As Cleo meets up with Pete, Holly, Nathan and John Paul arrive on the scene. John Paul pulls Cleo away and punches Pete in the face, but Pete punches him back. Cleo is conflicted as she feels protective of her cousin, but she is also protective of Pete. In October 2015, the show's series producer Iain McLeod announced that the storyline would culminate in a trial during 2016. McLeod also confirmed that Pete would not be killed off by the show's Gloved Hand Killer, as they wanted Cleo to reveal the truth about the abuse in \\"the correct way\\" in the hope that Pete would be dealt with by the justice system. Mulkerrin confirmed the trial would show viewers that a victim can get justice if they speak up, while Cleo would go through \\"a range of emotions.\\" The actress also stated that she had met with abuse survivors and learned that it would be \\"a long process\\" for Cleo. As the trial begins, Pete still has control over Cleo and he makes her think they have a future together. They stay in contact via a private online chat site, where Pete continues to manipulate Cleo, who still loves him. Cleo's family try to make her see that she is being abused and the way Pete has treated her is not normal, but this causes her to go into denial. Cleo thinks that nobody understands what she and Pete have. Pete belittles Cleo in court and tries to make her seem like a bad witness when he brings up a recent car crash which she took the blame for. During the episode broadcast on 28 June 2016, Pete was found guilty of child grooming and sexual activity with a child. The trial initially seems to be going in Pete's favour, but after Cleo speaks with Myra, she is convinced to tell the truth about her relationship with Pete. Cleo reveals when she first had sex with Pete, and hands over messages they exchanged and a photograph of them in bed together while she was underage. Following the verdict, Pete was take to prison. The conclusion to the trial marked Owen's final scenes in Hollyoaks. The abuse storyline was revisited in 2017, after Cleo learned Celine was dead. Cleo contacts Pete, as she needs someone to talk to in the wake of her sister's death. Pete uses a contraband phone to send text messages to Cleo and keep in touch with her. Car crash and Nathan Nightingale In March 2016, Cleo is involved in a car crash. She is a passenger in the car driven by Holly, who has been drinking, when it crashes into Nathan Nightingale (Jared Garfield) and his fianc√©e Rachel Hardy's (Jennifer Brooke) car. Nathan manages to free Cleo from the wreckage, but Rachel is killed during an explosion. Cleo takes the blame for the accident, so Holly is not punished for drink-driving. Clapham told Carena Crawford of All About Soap that Holly feels guilty about Cleo taking the blame. She constantly tells Cleo that she does not have to and insists that she will hand herself in. Holly struggles to forget what happened and turns to Cleo for reassurance. She later grows closer to Nathan and Cleo sees him put his hand on Holly's knee. Cleo then confronts Holly and wonders why she is still covering for her. As the storylines continue, Cleo begins to feel isolated. She feels that Holly has betrayed her, her family have other priorities, and the rest of the village thinks she is a murderer. Cleo's stepfather Pete Buchanan uses this to manipulate her further. Holly later develops feelings for Nathan and kisses him. As the day of the trial arrives, Nathan is \\"desperate\\" for Cleo to face justice for killing Rachel, while Celine and Myra notice that there is tension between Cleo and Holly. Outside the courthouse, Cleo suddenly begins to panic due to the pressure. Cleo is given community service instead of a prison sentence, which causes a \\"furious\\" Nathan to tip a bin over her. The truth about the car crash comes out during Pete's trial for abusing Cleo. The defence team ask Cleo if she was really the driver of the car that killed Rachel. Cleo had told Pete the truth about covering for Holly, and he uses his knowledge of the incident against her. A few weeks later, Cleo and Nathan share a \\"heart-to-heart\\" and bond over their recent troubles with Pete and Rachel. They eventually agree that they should move on, leading to speculation that there could be a romance between them in the future. The show's social media accounts came up with the portmanteau \\"Clathan\\" for the couple. Cleo and Nathan continue to bond when she is given a job at his family's pub. But when she notices that Holly is struggling and Nathan's behaviour towards her is not helping, Cleo encourages him to forgive Holly or risk losing her friendship. Nathan develops feelings for Cleo. When he receives an anonymous message inviting him to an event at the Loft, he assumes it is from Cleo and is surprised when Lisa Loveday (Rachel Adedeji) makes advances towards him. Nathan's sister encourages him to tell Cleo how he feels at her 18th birthday party, but she rejects him when he attempts to kiss her. She later sets Nathan up with Lisa and they begin dating. However, Cleo later realises that she does have feelings for him. Mulkerrin commented, \\"It is that blurred line where you really love someone as a friend and start to realise that you are attracted to them on another level.\\" She also thought that Cleo decided to \\"play Cupid\\" with Nathan and Lisa, as she did not think she and Nathan were ever going to get together. Celine encourages Cleo to write Nathan an email telling him about her feelings. Mulkerrin described the email as \\"sweet and honest\\" and said Cleo has no intention of sending it, but then she discovers Celine has done it for her. Lisa grows jealous of Nathan and Cleo's close friendship. She also knows Cleo has feelings for Nathan, so she is \\"furious\\" when she discovers Nathan has set up a cinema night for Cleo. Lisa tells Cleo to stay away from Nathan and she also asks Nathan to choose between her and Cleo. Mulkerrin thought Cleo and Nathan shared some similarities, saying that they were \\"on the same wavelength\\". She also branded them both \\"cute\\", \\"sweet\\" and \\"geeky\\". She also thought they would make a good couple, saying \\"I'm a sucker for romance, so I'm completely backing 'Clathan', as the fans call them! Cleo knows they have a proper connection ‚Äì but things are going to get worse for her before they get better...\\" Shortly after Celine's funeral, Cleo's family encourage her to tell Nathan how she really feels about him. However, just as she gets to the Dog in the Pond, Cleo witnesses Nathan fall to his death. Cleo's friendship with Lisa suffers as a result, and they later fight. Mulkerrin told a writer for the show's official website that Cleo really regrets helping Lisa and Nathan get together. Celine's death and heroin use In late 2016, Cleo's sister Celine is murdered by Cameron Campbell (Cameron Moore). Her body is found weeks later and Cleo struggles in the wake of the discovery, as she tries to accept Celine is dead. Without her mother and older sister Porsche around, it falls to Cleo to arrange Celine's funeral. Mulkerrin described Cleo as feeling \\"alone and vulnerable\\" without her mother and sisters, but the other McQueen relatives look out for her. Nana McQueen (Diane Langton) and Cleo's cousin Bart McQueen (Jonny Clarke) also return to the village for the funeral. Mulkerrin commented that Bart is \\"a bit of a bad egg\\" and it was not a positive thing for the family to have him around. The actress admitted to feeling nervous while filming the scenes, especially when she had to shoot Cleo's monologue, in which Cleo remembers all the things she and Celine used to get up to when they were younger. Cleo breaks down at the end of her speech, and Mulkerrin said that she just cannot believe that Cameron could have killed Celine. The service ends with Celine's family and friends throwing white feathers in the air. Mulkerrin explained that it was an homage to Celine's saying \\"If you see a white feather, there's a guardian angel nearby.\\" Cleo's next issue-led storyline saw her taking heroin, along with Bart. The storyline marks the beginning of \\"a downward spiral\\" for the character. Mulkerrin felt \\"lucky\\" upon receiving such a serious plot, saying \\"It's a new challenge for me ‚Äì and for Cleo it's been caused by a build-up of things. She's still grieving for her sister Celine and also for Nathan, who died right in front of her eyes.\\" In the weeks leading up to Cleo taking heroin, she is seen drinking a lot of alcohol to numb her pain, but she believes Bart when he says heroin makes you forget everything. Mulkerrin thought Cleo's actions showed that even the good characters can make bad decisions, and she hoped that her younger fans would see Cleo's downfall and realise how dangerous taking heroin is. Mulkerrin carried out research into how the drug effects people. She also had to consider how Cleo would be feeling during her comedown in scenes set the following day. She confirmed that the storyline would be ongoing and Cleo would be tempted to take heroin again, as it is easily accessible to her through Bart. Cleo later overdoses and is rushed to hospital by Joel Dexter (Rory Douglas-Speed) and Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas). She is tempted to return to the drugs den with Bart's encouragement. But when she catches him stealing money from Carmina McQueen's (Harlow Jones) christening cards, she feels guilty and confesses to her family that she has taken heroin. Bart flees the house when the McQueens direct their anger towards him for getting Cleo hooked on drugs. Mulkerrin thought Cleo would like to help Bart, but he was potentially beyond help. She also pointed out that he had not been very nice to Cleo, having got her into taking drugs in the first place and then leaving her when she had her overdose. Months later, Cleo relapses when she is rejected romantically by Joel. Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson) finds her passed out in a drugs den as he makes a drugs delivery. Seeing Cleo makes it \\"very real\\" to Darren and he tries to quit delivering drugs for Shane Sweeney (Michael Salami). Cleo begs Darren not to say anything about her using drugs, while Shane later supplies heroin to her. Relationship with Joel Dexter While she is grieving for her sister, Cleo receives support from Joel, a trainee Catholic priest. She opens up to him and they soon become friend. Mulkerrin commented that Cleo thinks Joel is \\"one of the good guys\\". Goldie McQueen (Chelsee Healey) becomes the first to realise that Cleo has a crush on Joel. During a night out at The Loft, Cleo, Goldie and Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) meet Joel and Warren. When Cleo gets drunk and embarrasses herself, Joel offers to walk her home. Cleo misreads the situation and attempts to kiss him. Mulkerrin joked that Cleo wants what she cannot have. After Joel returns from a retreat, Cleo visits him and is concerned by his odd behaviour and mentions of Bart. Joel admits to feeling safe with Cleo and they kiss. However, after Warren suggests that Cleo spend more time with his son, Joel rejects her and \\"cruelly\\" tells her to leave him alone. Of Cleo's feelings for Joel, Mulkerrin said \\"She tells Joel she loves him, but she knows he has restrictions as a man of the cloth. Her feelings may or may not be unrequited\\". Cleo and Joel continue to grow closer and she hopes that he will leave the Church for her. When she sees Joel meeting with a heroin dealer, she worries about him and becomes determined to help him. Cleo suggests they clean Joel's motorbike to help him take his mind off of drugs. In the middle of the cleaning, Cleo suddenly reveals that she has feelings for Joel. Mulkerrin called it \\"a really sweet scene\\" and thought the viewers would have liked it, as many of them had expressed their wishes for the characters to develop a romantic relationship. Cleo and Joel decide to leave the village and be together. Mulkerrin hinted that their trip would not end well and confirmed that there would be a big stunt, which would have repercussions for everyone involved. Cleo is thrown from the bike when it collides with a car carrying several of the teenage characters. She rolls down a hill and is not found by the paramedics. When Joel comes round, he realises that she is not at the hospital and goes back to find her. Cleo goes into cardiac arrest in the ambulance and Joel begs God to save her in return for him recommitting to the Church. Cleo attempts to move on from Joel with village newcomer Brody Hudson (Adam Woodward). Brody flirts with Cleo and she agrees to go on a date with him. Joel sees them together and ends up confronting Brody about his intentions towards Cleo. She later tells Joel to back off. Brody and Cleo kiss, but nothing comes of their brief romance. Joel and Cleo are brought together again when Cleo is kidnapped by Shane Sweeney. Shane learns that Joel and Darren Osborne have teamed up and plan to report him to the police, so he uses Cleo as a pawn to get revenge. Mulkerrin told Inside Soap's Laura Heffernan that while Joel and Cleo's relationship is \\"quite frayed\\", he still goes to save her. Shane holds Cleo hostage at an abandoned boiler room and when Joel reaches her, Shane locks him in too. Cleo also knows Shane has a gun, so she feels that they are in a \\"life-and-death\\" situation. Cleo and Joel reconcile and consummate their relationship. Darren eventually rescues Cleo and Joel, and Shane gives chase. When he manages to grab Cleo, Joel \\"charged himself\\" at Shane and caused them to both fall over a cliff edge. While Joel suffers minor injuries, Shane appears to be dead and they leave him. Cleo and Joel later report the incident to the police, but upon returning to the beach, Shane's body is gone. The incident prompts Joel to leave the Church to be with Cleo. After receiving a postcard from her sister Porsche, Cleo thinks she and Joel should have a holiday. They soon plan a trip to Tanzania so Joel can carry out some volunteer work. Holly soon notices that Cleo has lost enthusiasm about the trip and later finds her crying. Cleo reveals that she is pregnant with Joel's baby. Mulkerrin explained that Cleo is \\"overwhelmed, she's scared, and she's apprehensive\\", as she is still a teenager and has not been with Joel for long. Cleo chooses not to tell Joel straight away and she confides in Myra and Nana instead. Joel soon overhears them talking about the pregnancy, leaving Cleo feeling guilty for not telling him sooner. Mulkerrin admitted to being \\"really excited\\" about the storyline, as she had previously played a young mother in Waterloo Road and enjoyed working with babies. However, Cleo later chooses to have an abortion. She is prompted to make her decision when Joel is arrested for Bart's murder. He then reveals that Warren killed Bart. Bulimia nervosa The character's third issue-led storyline started airing in December 2017. Cleo develops bulimia nervosa after learning Joel is now in a relationship with Sienna Blake. At home, she binges on food and then makes herself sick. Mulkerrin said Cleo's bulimia is caused by her feeling \\"like an outsider\\", and the binging helps her feel like she is still in control. The show is working with the charity Beat on the storyline and they hope to increase awareness of the topic. Mulkerrin met with a bulimia sufferer and carried out her own research, so that she can portray the scenes as accurately as possible. Cleo's bulimia battle comes to a head during her wedding to Joel, which occurs in a special episode airing on World Mental Health Day. The episode sees Cleo talking about her day with psychiatrist Farrah Maalik (Krupa Pattani). Farrah has to stop Cleo and ask her to tell the truth, as it is shown that she is lying in a hospital bed. Cleo has developed a \\"skewed and idealistic view on events\\", so while she thinks the day went well, in reality she woke up full of \\"self-loathing\\", had a run, purged after eating a bacon sandwich, covered up her numerous injuries, and had to pin her wedding dress to fit. Shortly after saying their vows, Cleo collapses to the ground and is told that she has suffered a heart attack. Reception For her portrayal of Cleo, Mulkerrin was voted Best Newcomer at the 2015 Digital Spy Reader Awards. Of her win, Daniel Kilkelly stated, \\"Joining a soap and being handed the biggest issue-based storyline of the year is no easy challenge, but young Hollyoaks actress Nadine Mulkerrin did herself proud this year ‚Äì with truthful and sensitive performances as abused teen Cleo McQueen.\\" Mulkerrin was included in the longlist for Best Actress at The British Soap Awards 2016. The following year, she received a nomination for Best Female Dramatic Performance. Mulkerrin was also included on the longlist for Best Actress at the 2017 Inside Soap Awards. In 2018, Mulkerrin earned a nomination in the Best Female Dramatic Performance category at The British Soap Awards 2018. She also received another nomination for Best Actress at the Inside Soap Awards 2018, and another nomination in the Best Soap Actor (Female) category at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards, where she came in third place with 15.2% of the total vote. Cleo's bulimia story also received a nomination under the Best Soap Storyline category; it came in seventh place with 7.7% of the total votes. Anthony Langford, writing for NewNowNext, thought the Harry and Cleo pairing was \\"cute\\" and that they were a \\"likeable\\" couple. However, as Harry was gay, Langford did not think their relationship would end happily, saying \\"Cleo is the clingy type and can be a bit unstable. I don't think she's going to take it very well when the truth comes out.\\" Michael Cregan of Inside Soap praised Mulkerrin's performance. He highlighted Cleo's attempt to stop Reenie from drinking as \\"an outstanding scene\\" and said \\"We've always been a fan of Zoe Lucker, but young Nadine Mulkerrin gives her a run for her money. The following year, another contributor to Inside Soap praised Mulkerrin and Nicole Barber-Lane for their performances during Pete's trial, saying \\"They share a powerful scene where Cleo finally realises the truth.\\" Duncan Lindsay of Metro praised the sex abuse storyline, writing \\"Our hearts ached for Cleo and her vulnerability, we screamed at the television as Pete convincingly groomed her and the emotional and raw reactions around the revelations and accusations of abuse among the McQueens were jaw-droppingly powerful.\\" When Cleo begins taking heroin, Johnathon Hughes of Radio Times branded her \\"the good girl gone bad\\". Hughes also noticed that there was \\"a distinct spark\\" between Cleo and Joel. Sally Brockway from Soaplife commented that Cleo had \\"a habit of falling hopelessly in love with inappropriate men.\\" Laura Morgan, writing for Digital Spy, included Cleo and Joel in her feature on the eight characters to watch out for. She noted that the couple \\"look friggin' awesome together\\" and found their relationship \\"intriguing\\", as Joel was hiding secrets from Cleo. Coryon Gray, writing for TVSource Magazine, called Cleo \\"the best of the McQueen bunch.\\" He thought that due to her \\"unassuming\\" personality, she was easy to miss, so her family did not realise how much she was struggling when she began using heroin. Gray stated, \\"My guess is that they've left Cleo to her own devices simply because she's usually so strong- willed, so independent and keen on doing things her own way. When it comes to Cleo, one can usually trust her to be okay but she's so far from okay right now.\\" Gray was also a fan of Cleo and Joel, dubbing them \\"forbidden lovers\\" and naming their relationship as one of his favourites. He added that the pairing was \\"already much more intriguing than Cleo and sweet but boring Nathan could have ever brought to the table.\\" Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy pointed out that Cleo has experienced \\"her fair share of turmoil\\" since joining the soap and described her sexual abuse storyline as \\"harrowing\\".

It originated on the foothills of Vesuvius, in Campania in southern Italy. It may also be known as the Pecora di Poggiomarino, for the comune of Poggiomarino in that area. Its conservation status is not clear.  History  The origins of the Turchessa are unknown. It apparently originated in the foothills of Vesuvius, in Campania in southern Italy, in the area of Sarno in the province of Salerno and Avella in the province of Avellino, but is now distributed mainly in the provinces of Avellino and Benevento. Like the Laticauda, distributed in the approximately the same area, and the Barbaresca breed of Sicily, it appears to result from the hybridisation of local breeds with Barbary (or Barbarin) sheep of Maghrebi origin. These may have been brought to the area by the Bourbon king Charles VII of Naples. It has been suggested that the Turchessa is a synonym of the Laticauda, which, however, is a broad-tailed breed. The Turchessa is one of the forty-four autochthonous local sheep breeds of limited distribution officially recognised by the Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali, the Italian ministry of agriculture. A herd- book is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep-breeders. In 2007 the total number for the breed was reported as 4; in the same year the FAO classified its conservation status as \\"critical\\". Further research into numbers and distribution is needed. A small number are kept by the Consorzio per la Sperimentazione, Divulgazione e Applicazione di Biotecniche Innovative of Benevento.  Characteristics  The Turchessa is hardy, frugal, and well adapted to the poor pasture of its mountain environment. It is white, often with dark markings to the face and lower legs. The coat is thin and open. The hooves are strong, and are often black. Males are usually horned; the horns are spiralled.  Use  The Turchessa is kept mainly for milk production.

He played twenty-five first-class matches for New South Wales between 1889/90 and 1899/00. Newell, a right-arm off-spin and medium-pace bowler, was the most successful bowler in Sydney grade cricket in 1892-93, when he took 60 wickets for Glebe at an average of 5.43. At the end of that season he took 6 for 25 and 4 for 27 for New South Wales in a low-scoring match against Queensland that Queensland won by 17 runs. His best innings figures for New South Wales were 8 for 56 against Victoria in 1897-98. In November 1907 Newell was living with his wife in the Sydney suburb of Woollahra and working as a clerk in the Postal Department. He had been receiving medical treatment for a nervous condition, and had had to take a break from playing cricket, when he disappeared while walking his dogs. He was assumed to have died, but in early 1911 a friend in Sydney received a letter from him, sent from Valparaiso, Chile, where he had been living for some time under an assumed name.

Interested in the empirical observation of natural phenomena, his early work integrated the viewer's image with prerecorded information. He has been described as a \\"pioneer in video research [...] with an almost scientific attention for taxonomies and descriptions of ecological systems and environments\\". His seminal work Wipe Cycle ‚Äìco-produced with Ira Schneider in 1968‚Äì is considered one of the first video installations in art history. Gillette and Schneider exhibited this early \\"sculptural video installation\\" in TV as a Creative Medium, the first show in the United States devoted to Video Art. In October 1969, Frank Gillette and Michael Shamberg founded the Raindance Corporation, a \\"media think-tank [...] that embraced video as an alternative form of cultural communication.  Biography   Life and education  Frank Gillette was born in 1941 in Jersey City, NJ. He attended Columbia University ‚Äìdropping out after two years‚Äì and studied painting at Pratt Institute in New York ‚Äìdropping out also after two years. He lives with the artist Suzanne Anker in Manhattan and East Hampton, NY.  Video Art pioneer  Gillette was one of the first artist to explore video as a vehicle for social and political change. Described as an \\"abstract painter turned media activist\\", Frank Gillette's fascination with Marshall McLuhan's ideas made him connect with Paul Ryan ‚Äìwho was McLuhan's assistant at the Center for Media Understanding at Fordham University in the Bronx. During the spring of 1968, Ryan facilitated access to four Portapack video cameras, that Gillette (and others) used to make alternative television.  Raindance Corporation  Raindance Corporation was conceived in 1969 by Frank Gillette to \\"promote and disseminate ideas about video as a radical alternative to centralized television broadcasting\\". In October 1969, Frank Gillette, Michael Shamberg, Louis Jaffe, and Marco Vassi registered Raindance as a Delaware corporation ‚Äìin an ironic reference to the mainstream organization Rand Corporation.. Raindance was later joined by Phyllis Gershuny and Beryl Korot, who worked producing the publication Radical Software.  Awards and recognition  Frank Gillette is the recipient of fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation (1983) and the Guggenheim Foundation (1979), as well as grants from the New York State Council on the Arts (1970, 1972, 1974) and the National Endowment for the Arts (1976, 1980). He was artist-in-residence at the American Academy in Rome in 1984-85.  Selected works   Keep, 1968  4-channel video, black and white, 20 min each.  Wipe Cycle, 1969  Video installation with one CCTV camera, six videotape recorders (two playback prerecorded material and four record and playback time-delay loops), nine television monitors of which one is a receiver, one audio tape deck, and one automatic switcher, 9¬Ω x 8 x 2 ft. Built for the exhibition TV As A Creative Medium, Howard Wise Gallery, New York. Wipe Cycle (1969) is a seminal video installation by Frank Gillette and Ira Schneider that transposes present-time demands as a way to disrupt television‚Äôs one-sided flow of information. Consider an example of the \\"earliest uses of real-time closed-circuit video technology in an art gallery\\", Wipe Cycle \\"expanded the relation of the audience to the artwork, from passive receptors to actual participants\\". In the exhibition TV as a Creative Medium (1969), this installation was constructed in front of an elevator so that each visitor was immediately confronted with his or her image. The monitors also featured two videotapes and a television program. The installation made visitors part of the information. It was programmed in a highly complicated fashion: in four cycles, images wandered from one monitor to another delayed by eight or sixteen seconds, while counter-clockwise a gray light impulse wiped out all of the other images every two seconds. Gillette and Schneider sought to \\"create a experience that would break the conventional single-screen TV perspective by providing a complex mix of live images and multiple viewports\\".  The Rays, 1970  Video, black and white, 20 minutes. Produced with Paul Ryan.  Hark! Hork!, 1972-1973  Video, black and white, sound, 19:25 min.

Tetragramaton, 1973  Video, black and white, 138 min. Six videotape playback decks, one audio deck, 30 television monitors, 10 (h) x 20' (diameter) x 25 minutes. Six different prerecorded channels of video information are simultaneously displayed on the monitors, with two different channels displayed on each stack of ten in the illustrated arrangement. Taking its title from the four consonants of the ancient Hebrew name for God, Tetragramaton contemplates the relationship between man, technology, and ecological systems.  Muse, 1974  Three- channel video, black and white, 26:00 min each. Characteristic of much of Gillette's work‚Äîwhich treats video as a field of light, movement and reflection‚ÄîMuse extends beyond optical sensation to engage the viewer in metaphysical contemplation.  Quidditas, 1974-1975  Video, color, sound, 19:00 min. Originally designed as a three-channel work, Quidditas is a study of Cape Cod's woodland and coastal landscapes.  Rituals for a Still Life, 1974-1975  Video, black and white, sound, 24:54 min. A stunning graphic composition of form and surface, Rituals for a Still Life links Gillette's video and collage work. Here he constructs a series of enigmatic collages that have as their background a television monitor showing his videotapes.  The Maui Cycle, 1976  Three-channel video installation, color, sound, 45:40 min. In this three-channel work, Gillette employs systematic formal strategies to chart the rich texture and aura of the Hawaiian landscape.  Mecox, 1976-77  Three-channel video installation, color, sound. 18:06 min (each channel). Rhythmically composed, Mecox is an artificial system that gracefully charts the patterns of a natural ecosystem. In this three-channel work, Gillette presents a microcosm of Mecox Bay, a salt marsh on Long Island, by reconstructing it within a contained aquarium  Symptomatic Syntax, 1981  Video, color, sound, 27:20 min. Symptomatic Syntax is a recreation of an ecological environment in which natural forms ‚Äî leaves, flower petals, butterfly wings ‚Äî form an ever-changing, visually compelling series of compositions. Riverrun, 2017-2018  Three-channel video installation, color, sound. Riverrun (2017-2018) is a three-channel video installation by Frank Gillette. The work focuses on humans‚Äô experience with the natural world positions through art historical genres. Each channel is titled individually and has a slightly different duration, creating variations in time when projected: Still Life (left, 23:29 min), Counter-Statement (center, 23:28 min), and Landscape (right, 24:00 min). This is the most recent large scale video installation by the pioneer video artist. Riverrun was premiered at the exhibition Frank Gillette: Excavations and Banquets (February 9 ‚Äì April 21, 2019) at the Everson Museum of Art, Syracuse, New York, and is in its permanent collection.

She was eight years old when the Gulf War began and was forced to evacuate with her family to move to America. Her little brother was born in America, and when the war began the American Embassy came looking for and rescued Mustafa and her family. After coming to America, she grew up in Philadelphia and learned English in an English-as-a-second-language class. Her first job was working in a 7-Eleven store owned by her father. She got into tech when she was 24 and interned at a tech consultancy firm while in the entrepreneurship program at Temple University in Philadelphia. She worked her way up at the firm and was offered a job by the company owner, Skip Shuda, after she graduated from college.

Mustafa came up with the idea of ROAR for Good when she was 30 years old and traveling in Spanish countries for six months. While traveling, she was told horror stories about women who had been sexually assaulted or harassed, and when she returned from her trip, she found out her neighbor had been severely beaten and raped. These stories made her realize the prevalence of violence against women, and she wanted to do something about it.

Over the course of his career he became involved in the internal power struggle over the Holy Roman crown. In 1627, he received the Spanish version of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Biography Harrach was born in 1570: he was the second child of Leonhard IV Graf von Harrach and Maria Jacobea Gr√§fin Hohenzollern. In 1590, he bore the flag of Charles II at his funeral. He served as the chamberlain of Archduke Ernest of Austria. On 11 August 1595, he was appointed by emperor Rudolf II to the Lower Austrian Regimentsrathe. At the time of an internal power struggle between Rudolf and his brothers, he used his position in the Imperial Court to supply Ferdinand II (who resided in Graz) with vital information about the other pretenders to the Imperial crown. In 1601, he was appointed to the position of Imperial chamberlain. In 1608, he played an instrumental role in Matthias's seizure of the titles of Archduke of Austria, King of Croatia and King of Hungary. From 1614 until 1617, he served as an imperial ambassador in various states within the empire. On 26 September 1617, he became the cosignatory of the Treaty of Madrid (1617) along with Venetian ambassadors Giustiniani and Contarini, the treaty officially ended the Uskok War between the two states. In 1620, he was sent as an Imperial envoy to the court of Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria. He then became a member of emperor Ferdinand's Geheimrat (Privy Council), he joined the \\"Spanish faction\\" of the council centered around Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg. In January 1625, his castle in Bruck an der Leitha was exempt from provincial taxation. On 25 August, he was granted the right to establish a private mint which he operated together with House of Liechtenstein. In 1627, Philip IV of Spain awarded him the Order of the Golden Fleece. On 16 May 1628, Harrach died in Prague, his body was subsequently transported to the Harrach family mausoleum located in the Augustinian Church, Vienna. Family His marriage to Maria Elisabeth Freiin von Schrattenbach the daughter of Eggeberg, produced 6 sons and 3 daughters. His sons Johann Karl and Max served in the Imperial army and were killed in action during the course of the Thirty Years' War, dying unmarried. Ernst Adalbert (born 1598) became the Archbishop of Prague, heading the recatholicization in Bohemia. Franz Albrecht served as a diplomat, his marriage to Anna Magdalena Freiin von J√∂rgen produced no children. Leonhard and Otto Friedrich were the founders of two lines of succession. His eldest daughter was married to count Max von Waldstein cousin of Albrecht Wallenstein. His two younger daughters Elisabeth and Maximiliana were married to Imperial Generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein and his comrade Adam Erdmann Trƒçka von L√≠pa respectively. Harrach's death and Eggeberg's resignation negatively influenced Wallenstein's popularity within the Imperial court, facilitating an internal purge orchestrated by Wallenstein's opponents. Wallenstein and Trƒçka were both murdered during the purge's culmination the Eger Bloodbath. Notes ;Footnotes ;Citations References Constantin von Wurzbach: Harrach, Karl.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. Adverse effects In the clinical trials that lead to emapalumab's FDA approval, the most commonly reported adverse effects were infections (56%), high blood pressure (41%), infusion reactions (27%), and fever (24%). Serious adverse effects occurred in about half of the subjects studied in the clinical trial that led to its FDA approval. Pharmacology Mechanism of action In the setting of HLH, over-secretion of IFN-Œ≥ is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Emapalumab binds and neutralizes IFN-Œ≥, preventing it from inducing pathological effects. Pharmacokinetics Like other antibody-based medications, which are made of amino acid chains called polypeptides, emapalumab is broken down into smaller peptides via the body's normal catabolism. Society and culture  Legal status  The FDA awarded orphan drug status in 2012, and breakthrough therapy designation in 2016 on the basis of preliminary data from the phase II trial. In July 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the refusal of the marketing authorization for emapalumab. Research The research name of emapalumab was NI-0501. A phase II/III trial began in 2013 and is ongoing . The trial targets patients under the age of 18 who have failed to improve on conventional treatments.

Plot Framing sequence Directed by Sofia Carrillo The anthology is framed by stop-motion-animated segments depicting a walking dollhouse with a blinking doll face on it. A doll hand separate, but also living, moves from its drawer and scurries around collecting items the dollhouse finds. Within its interior, various objects and items are shown including: a cabinet where bugs and moths enter acting as a stomach of sorts, a room with living sewing needles that make tiny tapestries, and a room with a morphing apple that seems to act as the dollhouse's heart. Eventually, the dollhouse finds a small blackbird (whether it is stuffed or an actual dead bird is ambiguous). The dollhouse places the bird into a baby doll and upon it crying immediately removes the bird and enters a room with an unconscious girl. The girl has a small door on her chest and the dollhouse places the bird inside it. After a while, the girl awakens, pleasing the dollhouse. The Box Written and directed by Jovanka Vuckovic, based on the short story by Jack Ketchum While riding on a train with his mother Susan, a young boy, Danny, sees an old man with a red box; the old man describes it as \\"a present\\" and allows Danny to look inside.

She spends the day frantically trying to conceal David's body from Lucy, nanny Carla, and neighbor Madeleine. She finally buys a panda costume off of a man who comes to sing Lucy a birthday song, and hides the body in the costume. During the party, Mary does not have time to move the costumed body and is forced to set it up on a seat at the table. Carla bumps the costume, causing it to collapse into Lucy's birthday cake.

She is called into Andy's school to meet with the principal regarding an incident in which Andy tore off a classmate's fingernails. The principal apologizes to Cora that she had to witness an \\"outburst\\" from the classmate's mother, and tells Cora that her son is remarkable. Cora is deeply unnerved that her son appears to have entranced his superiors. Cora's mailman Chet hints that Andy is not necessarily her distant former husband's (an actor) son. Andy - whose voice has changed and finger and toenails have become claws - confirms her suspicions: he is transforming into the spawn of Satan, something she has worried about since before his birth. Andy, embracing his father's power, forces Cora to bow down to him as Satan enters the house to reclaim him, but she then embraces and quickly tells her son the reason they went into hiding, and asserts that she refuses to give up Andy to his father. Andy, moved, chooses her over his destiny. The two hold each other tight as their bones crack and blood seeps from their noses and mouths until they die from Satan's assault.

The film, like the novel, is set in the Cape Town seaside suburb of Muizenberg. It was directed by Meg Rickards and starred, among others, Christia Visser, Nse Ikpe-Etim, Brendon Daniels, Dann-Jacques Mouton, Quanita Adams and Lee anne Van Rooi. The screenplay was also written by Tracey Farren. It was shot by Dutch director of photography Bert Haitsma and edited by Linda Man. It was produced by Kim Williams and Paul Egan. Plot Tess tells the story of sassy twenty-year-old who sells her body on Cape Town's streets. She survives by popping painkillers by the bunch and through her wry humour. But her life turns upside down when she falls pregnant. Though Tess tries to run, her past torments her. She begins to question her own sanity. Tess fights back, fighting her demons, searching for the truth.

She‚Äôs a young woman who is undergoing a tumultuous journey: facing the truth of her childhood, coming to terms with it and moving forward with her inner dignity intact. She is so unflinchingly honest that your skin itches; you feel her suffering like a punch in the gut and her catharsis like a purging of your own emotional closet. \\"We have shot a film that inhabits Tess on every level; where the cinematography, sound design and music are all about her experience of the world. We wanted to get into her eyes, to feel what she is feeling. Most of the film is handheld, because we want to create the feeling that the camera is present with the actors, moving, reacting and breathing with them. \\"Stylistically we were inspired by the organic, \\"honest\\" quality of films such as Fish Tank (dir. Andrea Arnold) and Biutiful (dir. Alejandro I√±√°rritu), while working in a very different setting and with an extremely different set of social realities. We have used exclusively found locations, bathed in intense African light and colour. The editing style prioritises emotional arc rather than continuity.

The building's architect, Paul Thiry who also designed the Century 21 Exposition complex in Seattle, used Modern design incorporating the Wilkeson sandstone quarried a few tens of miles away and used in the state capitol and other buildings. It was the last monumental building added to the capitol campus and one of the few departures from the Olmsted Brothers' 1928 campus plan. It was described as \\"among the most important regional archetypes of mid-century architectural design and thought...a textbook on how Washingtonians looked at the future in the 1950s\\". It was named for Joel M. Pritchard, a U.S. Congressman from Washington and the state's Lieutenant Governor. Thiry won the American Institute of Architects/American Library Association Library Building Award for the design, the first such award to be presented. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. After the 2001 Nisqually Earthquake, the damaged state capitol building was evacuated, and the library collection and staff were moved out of the building for occupation by other activities. As of the 2010s it was occupied by the Code Reviser and other administrative staff. Public art Up to 2.5 percent of the building's construction cost was reserved for public art. The pieces placed at the library immediately after construction included Du Pen Fountain, a sundial by John W.

Based in Tumwater, it is a service of the Washington Secretary of State and was founded in 1853 as the Washington Territorial Library. The library has a collection of 2.25 million physical items and other online resources available to residents of the state. History The Washington Territorial Library was established on March 2, 1853, with the signing of the Organic Act by President Millard Fillmore to create Washington Territory. The law included an appropriation of $5,000 for the territory library that was used by appointed Territorial Governor Issac Stevens to buy and ship 2,130 volumes from New York City to Olympia. The first shipment of books departed from New York City on May 21, 1853, aboard the Invincible, which traveled around Cape Horn and South America to San Francisco. The books were transferred to the Tarquinia and arrived in Olympia on October 23, 1853, a few weeks before Governor Stevens arrived from his overland trip and took office. The library was opened to public use beginning in 1855, after an amendment to the territorial library law was passed by the territorial legislature. Prior to achieving statehood on November 11, 1889, the Territorial Library reported a collection of 10,448 volumes. The new state legislature passed a bill creating the state library on March 27, 1890. The state library's collection was organized under the Dewey Decimal Classification system in 1898, and a card index was created in 1901. The library occupied the Joel M. Pritchard Building on the State Capitol campus in Olympia from 1958 until it was damaged by the 2001 Nisqually earthquake and evacuated. At its greatest extent in the 1990s, the library contained 547,000 books, periodicals, and documents. The library was moved to a temporary location in Tumwater in December 2001, while the Pritchard Building underwent already-planned renovations and served as the temporary chambers for the state senate. The general collection was downsized by 260,000 books, which were donated to local libraries. The state government proposed closing the state library as part of its 2002 budget, saving $9 million in annual expenses, but the library was saved by eliminating the state library commission and merging operations with the Office of the Secretary of State effective July 1, 2002. The state government attempted to eliminate the state library a second time in December 2002, with collections transferred to local universities and colleges, but was saved by downsizing its staff and reorganizing under the Office of the Secretary of State. The library has since expanded its digital collections, which include scanned copies of older state newspapers and books. In 2019, the state legislature approved a $2 fee on recorded documents to fund the construction of a new library and archives building in Tumwater. The $108 million project would construct a joint facility on the South Campus near the former state library. The Washington State Archives are currently housed in a building on the capitol campus that was constructed in 1962 and deemed too small to hold the state's records.

It takes its name after Marienlyst House, a neighboring former royal summer retreat, which was part of it from its foundation in 1859 until 1896. Facilities include a restaurant, bar, wellness area and a casino. The Danish national football team stays at the hotel in connection with home matches and training sessions. History Marienlyst Spa Hotel in 1860, illustration from Illustreret Tidende In the second half of the 19th century, the √òresund coast became a popular summer destination for wealthy citizens from Copenhagen. J. S. Nathanson, a broker from Helsing√∏r, rented Marienlyst House from Helsing√∏r Municipality with the intention of opening a spa hotel. His inspiration came from visits to spa towns in Germany. As a publicity stunt, to profit from nearby Kronborg Castle's reputation as the home of Hamlet, he renamed a natural spring in the cliff behind the house Ophelia's Spring and constructed Hamlet's Grave nearby. Marienlyst Spa (Marienlyst Kur- og S√∏badeanstalt) opened on 1 June 1858. Nathansen also charged the architect Niels Peder Christian Hols√∏e with the design of a new hotel building but went bankrupt before it had been completed and the project was there taken over by Helsing√∏r Municipality. The new hotel building was inaugurated on 22 June 1861 with J. W. Briggs as operator. When Sarah Benhard was in Copenhagen in the summer of 1880 to perform in Adrienne Lecouvreur at the Royal Theatre, she vusuted Hotel Marienlyst to see the Tomb of Hamlet and Ophelia's Spring. Hotel Marienlyst's original building seen on a detail from a painting from 1891 The hotel was acquired by a private consortium in 1883. The hotel was expanded with a new hotel and restaurant building as well as a building used for theatre and concerts. Rge spa hotel was frequented by both Danish and international high society. King Christian IV's brother, Prince Hans, stayed in the hotel's room 15 in the summer time several years in a row and the king visited it at several occasions. Alexander III of Russia visited it for lunch. Old advertisement for Hotel Marienlyst The connection between the hotel and the former royal residence ended in 1896. The spa hotel was acquired by master butcher Anders Jensen in 1897. He became alderman of the butchers' guild in Copenhagen in 1906 where he would expand his hotel business with the construction of Palace Hotel in 1908. In 1998, Jensen launched an invited architectural competition for the expansion of his new spa hotel. The competition was won by Richard Bergmanns and the extension was built in 1898-1900. A new residence was built in 1915 yp design by the architect Poul Hols√∏e. The hotel was acquired by C.C. Klestrup in 1929. It was later purchased by Aage Stentoft and reopened after a comprehensive refurbishment on 12 May 1943. Stentoft had to flee the country due to his involvement with the resistance movement. Stig Lommer's Hornb√¶k Eevue used the theatre building in the summer of 1844. The German occupying forces confiscated the building in April 1945. After the liberation on 5 May, the hotel was used for housing German refugees until 1947. The hotel went through several crises in the 1980s and 1990s. Somce 2008, the Danish national football team has stayed at Hotel Marienlyst in connection with home matches and during training sessions. The hotel was damaged in the storm Bodil in 2013.

A foremost citizen of Douglas, he was a tall commanding figure who was in constant demand as a speaker on formal (and informal) occasions. Blessed with a vivid memory, it was said that he could recall the coronation festivities in Douglas for King George IV, King William IV and Queen Victoria. It was said of him that he always took a benevolent attitude to the poorer citizens of the Island, and was a trustee of various charitable bodies. He took a principal part in the founding of the House of Industry in Douglas, and it was a source of immense pride to him that he was instrumental in persuading Queen Victoria to become a subscriber to its upkeep, the queen contributing the sum of ¬£25 annually. Another charitable cause to which he was associated was the hospital when it was situated in Fort Street, Douglas, the committee of which he was chairman for many years. In addition he was a generous subscriber to the Douglas Coal FundManx Sun. Saturday, 23 December 1905 Page: 11 and the Ladies Soup Dispensary. In 1897 he was also instrumental in raising money for the dependents of nineteen miners who lost their lives the Snaefell Mine Disaster. Samuel Harris was appointed as a trustee to the estate of Henry Bloom Noble following the death of Noble in 1903, being in part responsible for the more than ¬£250,000 which Noble had left to Manx charities in his will. He was also a trustee of the will of the recluse Peter Baume who also bequeathed the bulk of his estate to the Manx people.Isle of Man Times.

In Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2014, it was ranked 161st out of 175 countries. The previous year, it was at 163rd out of 177 countries. This marked a decline from its 2012 ranking, 150th out of 174 countries. In 2013, Guinea-Bissau scored below the averages for both Africa and West Africa on the Mo Ibrahim Foundation‚Äôs Index of African Governance. The Heritage Foundation stated that corruption is characteristic of the Bissau-Guinean government and economy. Government mismanagement in Guinea- Bissau, according to Transparency International's 2014 report on the country, has ‚Äúcreated an environment conducive to corruption on a grand scale.‚Äù There is a culture of impunity, and citizens have no right to access information. Much of the corruption in Guinea-Bissau is related to the fact that the country is a hub of international drug trafficking. ‚ÄúAbject poverty, state collapse, lack of means and endemic corruption,‚Äù states one source, ‚Äúhave made Guinea Bissau a heaven for the Colombian drug lords.‚Äù Background U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady with President Jos√© M√°rio Vaz A Transparency International report on Guinea-Bissau notes the systemic instability and mismanagement of the government, as testified to by the fact that none of its presidents has ever completed an entire term in office. A former Portuguese colony and ‚Äúone of the most fragile states in Africa,‚Äù the nation won its independence in 1974 and has experienced several coups in the decades since then. In recent times, low economic growth has made it difficult for government officials to manage patronage networks and compensate cronies, thus feeding the growth of other forms of illegal self-enrichment, notably trafficking in drugs and weapons. These trafficking networks have made the country a hub for illegal commerce. There was some improvement in corruption between 2008 and 2011. Then, in 2012, the government was overthrown in a military coup, which brought an end to attempts to curb corruption and introduce other reforms. In 2014, voters elected Jos√© M√°rio Vaz to the presidency. Drug trafficking The country has been a drug-trafficking hub since around the turn of the 21st century, and many of its political and military leaders are deeply involved in the drug trade. Illegal narcotics from Latin America make their way to Europe by way of Guinea-Bissau, which the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) considers the world's only ‚Äúnarco-state.‚Äù As of 2007, Colombian drug cartels had, for the past three years, been using Guinea-Bissau as a major transit point for European trafficking. At that time, according to the US DEA, 800‚Äì1000 kg of cocaine were being flown nightly into Guinea-Bissau with an additional amount coming in by sea. Latin American cocaine barons, Der Spiegel has explained, look for corrupt nations in convenient geographic locations, as ideal for trafficking drugs. Authorities in Guinea-Bissau who seek to curb the drug traffic lack the most basic equipment, such as vehicles and radios, and often have insufficient gasoline supplies. The country has no able or willing force for law and order, creating the ideal hub for narco-trafficking. It also has poorly enforced border, unmonitored airfields, and a weak civilian government. In addition, it virtually never extradites anyone, as evidenced by the case of murderer and hijacker George Wright, who after his conviction in the U.S. worked for years in Guinea-Bissau as a basketball coach. Government The government's fiscal operations are characterized by a lack of transparency, of predictability, of budgeting control, collusion among government and key personnel, and of external controls over public spending. High-ranking officials in the country have accumulated ‚Äúunprecedented wealth and influence‚Äù and enjoy a high degree of impunity. Political corruption consists largely of involvement in narcotics trafficking. This involvement, according to Transparency International, has overhauled patronage systems in Guinea-Bissau, ultimately lessening the state's role in corruption scheme, weakening the government as a whole. President Under the constitution, the President has extremely broad powers, including lawmaking authority and the ability to appoint judges. This makes it easy for him to abuse his power and accumulate wealth at the expense of the people. Critics have argued that the president's power should be limited in specific ways while the prime minister's, parliament's, attorney general's, the judiciary's powers are strengthened and reinforced. Critics have also called for a merit-based civil service. Military, police, and security forces Guinea-Bissau's security and law-enforcement sectors are vulnerable to corruption and interference by politicians. Inadequate pay scales for members of the police and correctional services make them more vulnerable to corruption. Criminality and brutality among Bissau-Guinean security forces are well documented, as are cases of senior officials bypassing police authority by releasing prisoners and confiscating cocaine. An unclear situation involving jurisdiction results in institutional conflicts, especially where criminal investigations are concerned. Members of the police, security forces, and military are all involved in aiding and abetting the drug trade. For example, the military is engaged in leasing airbases and naval yards to drug traffickers, who have also rented islands to build front companies to mask plane movements. Also, the drug trade has helped breed a culture of intimidation and violence within the military. Judiciary The judiciary lacks adequate resources and training and also lacks independence. It does not pursue corruption charges. No one in the country has ever been prosecuted for or convicted of money laundering. The public largely distrusts the nation's court system, due to the high costs of seeking justice and the lack of ethics, that leads people to solve disputes outside the legal system. Judicial corruption is a discouragement to business, according to roughly a quarter of companies that responded a World Bank 2006 Enterprise Survey. A 2001 Amnesty International report suggested that the dismissal of several Supreme Court judges and clerks were related to judicial decisions that displeased the government. Impact on business In a 2006 World Bank survey, 44% of firms said that corruption was a major hindrance to business. In 2008, 27.6% of firms in Guinea-Bissau had been asked for bribes at least once; in Africa as a whole, the figure was 22.3%, and in the entire world, the figure was 17.4%. In the same year, fully 48.9% of firms in Guinea-Bissau said they had given ‚Äúgifts‚Äù to win government contracts, as compared to 31.1% of firms in Africa generally. Almost two-thirds of firms in the country said they had been expected to bribe public officials in order to accomplish certain ends. For manufacturers operating in Guinea-Bissau, bribes could reach up to 4.4% of costs. Anti-corruption efforts Guinea-Bissau has few institutions or laws that are intended to fight corruption. Like other countries in Lusophone Africa, it lacks a formal ethics code, has an inadequate number of external auditors, and has weak quality control. The Committee Against Corruption, created in 1995, was intended to address and prevent acts of corruption within the government and elsewhere. The Court of Accounts, the leading audit institution, was introduced in 2006 to audit the accounts and budget of the Ministry of Finance. Guinea-Bissau has ratified several United Nations Conventions combatting corruption as well as the African Union's Convention on Corruption. In 2008, Guinea-Bissau was found to be non-compliant with 34 of the 49 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) statutes, which cover such matters as due diligence and the criminalization of terrorism financing. In 2009, the country reformed its procurement system in conformity with West African Economic Monetary Union guidelines. This reform involved the establishment of a new regulatory body, the formation of a public procurement department, the institution of an audit unit to vet the central unit's procurement transactions, and the introduction of a new procurement infrastructure. A new system for managing public expenditure, instituted in or shortly before 2010, helped control government expenses by obliging every government office to submit an annual budget and progress reports to parliament. As of 2011, the country planned a comprehensive set of anti-corruption reforms. After the 2012 military coup, however, reform efforts were ended. Some drug arrests have been made, including arrests of military officials, but defendants have not been successfully prosecuted. In March 2012, former Procurator General announced investigations into the murders of President Jo√£o Vieira and the Commander of the military, General Tagme Na Waie, had halted due to difficulty in gathering evidence. In August 2015, President Jose Mario Vaz dismissed Prime Minister Domingos Pereira and the members of his cabinet, accusing them of corruption, nepotism, and obstruction of justice. The UN and GIABA helped establish Guinea-Bissau's Financial Intelligence Unit, but its resources are too limited for it to be able to exercise its functions. U.S. actions In April 2013, the US arrested the head of Guinea-Bissau's navy in international waters on drug-trafficking charges. He was receiving commissions of $1 million per ton for facilitating the shipment of illicit drugs into the US and Europe. In the same year, a US grand jury indicted the head of Guinea-Bissau's armed forces for trafficking cocaine and weapons.

It allows anyone to host their own server node in the network, and its various separately operated user bases are federated across many different servers. These nodes are referred to as \\"instances\\" by Mastodon users. These servers are connected as a federated social network, allowing users from different servers to interact with each other seamlessly. Mastodon is a part of the wider Fediverse, allowing its users to also interact with users on different open platforms that support the same protocol, such as PeerTube and Friendica. Mastodon has microblogging features similar to Twitter, or Weibo, although it is distinct from them, and unlike a typical software as a service platform, it is not centrally hosted. Each user is a member of a specific, independently operated server. Users post (by defaultNumerous servers use a larger character limit.) short messages called \\"toots\\" for others to see, and can adjust each of their post's privacy settings. The specific privacy options may vary between sites, but typically include direct messaging, followers only, public but not listed in the public feed, and public and posted to the public feed. The Mastodon mascot is a brown or grey woolly mammoth, sometimes depicted using a tablet or smartphone. Each operating server has its own code of conduct, terms of service, and moderation policies. This differs from centrally hosted social networks by allowing users to choose a specific server which has policies they agree with, or to leave a server that has policies they disagree with, without losing access to Mastodon's social network. Functionality and features Mastodon servers run social networking software that is capable of communicating using the ActivityPub standard, which has been implemented since version 1.6. A Mastodon user can therefore interact with users on any other server in the Fediverse that supports ActivityPub. The Mastodon Mascot Since version 2.9.0 Mastodon offers a single column mode for new users by default. In advanced mode Mastodon approximates the microblogging user experience of TweetDeck. Users post short-form status messages for others to see. On Mastodon, these messages can include up to 500 text-based characters, an extension of Twitter's 280-character limit, although numerous Mastodon servers forked the source code to allow a larger character limit. Posts are called \\"toots\\" instead of \\"tweets\\", as is the case on Twitter. Users join a specific Mastodon server, rather than a single website or application. The servers are connected as nodes in a network, and each server can administrate its own rules, account privileges, and whether to share messages to and from other servers. Many servers have a theme based on communal interests, such as Internet memes or technology. It is also common for servers to be based around a particular locality, region, or country. The social media software includes a number of specific privacy features. Each message has a variety of privacy options available, and users can choose whether the post is public or private. Public messages display on a global feed, known as a timeline, and private messages are only shared on the timelines of the user's followers. Messages can also be marked as unlisted from timelines or direct between users. Users can also mark their accounts as completely private. In the timeline, messages can display with an optional \\"content warning\\" feature, which requires readers to click on the content to reveal the rest of the message. Mastodon servers have used this feature to hide spoilers, trigger warnings, and not safe for work (NSFW) content, though some accounts use the feature to hide links and thoughts others might not want to read. Mastodon aggregates messages in local and federated timelines in real-time. The local timeline shows messages from users on a singular server, while the federated timeline shows messages across all participating Mastodon servers. Users can communicate across connected Mastodon servers with usernames similar in format to full email addresses. In early 2017, journalists like Sarah Jeong distinguished Mastodon from Twitter for its approach to combating harassment, one of Twitter's largest issues. Mastodon uses community-based moderation, in which each server can limit, or filter out undesirable types of content. For example, mastodon.social and several other servers ban content that is illegal in Germany or France, including Nazi symbolism, Holocaust denial and discrimination. Servers can also choose to limit, or filter out messages with disparaging content. Mastodon's founder Eugen Rochko believes that small, closely related communities police toxic behavior more effectively than a large company's small safety team. Users can also block and report others to administrators, much like on Twitter. In September 2018, with the release of version 2.5 with redesigned public profile pages, Mastodon marked its 100th release. Then, at the end of October, Mastodon 2.6 came out, introducing the possibilities of verified profiles and live, in-stream link previews for images and videos. Since January 2019, it is possible to search for multiple hashtags at once, instead of searching for just a single hashtag, as was the case before the release of version 2.7. Version 2.7 also has more robust moderation capabilities for server administrators and moderators, while accessibility, such as contrast for users with sight issues, has also been improved. The ability for users to create and vote in polls, as well as a new invitation system to manage registrations have been integrated in April 2019. Since the release of Mastodon 2.8.1 in May 2019, images with content warnings are, by default, blurred instead of completely hidden. The most significant addition to Mastodon's functionality in June 2019 has been an optional single- column view in version 2.9. This view is now displayed by default to all new users, although it can be changed to the original column-based view in Mastodon's preferences. In August of 2020 Mastodon 3.2 was released. It included a redesigned audio player with custom thumbnails and the ability to add personal notes to one's profile. Technology Mastodon is written as a free, web-based software for federated microblogging, which anybody can contribute code to, and which anyone can run on their own server infrastructure, if they wish, or join servers run by other people within the fediverse network. Its server-side technology is powered by Ruby on Rails and Node.js, and its front end is written in React.js and Redux. The service is interoperable with the decentralized social networks and platforms which use the ActivityPub protocol between each other. Since version 3.0, Mastodon dropped previous support for OStatus. Client apps for mobile devices, desktop computers, and web browsers interacting with the Mastodon API have been released for a range of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. Adoption Introductory video explaining Mastodon While Mastodon was first released in October 2016, the service began to expand in late March and early April 2017. The Verge wrote that the community at this time was small and that it had yet to attract the personalities that keep users at Twitter. The global use has risen from 766,500 users as of 1 August 2017, to 1 million users on 1 December 2017. In November 2017 artists, writers and entrepreneurs such as Chuck Wendig, John Scalzi, Melanie Gillman and later John O'Nolan joined in. Another spike in popularity came in March, through April 2018, due to the concerns about user privacy raised by the #deletefacebook effort. Mastodon, along with a number of other alternative social media sites, saw a large uptick in membership, gaining thousands of new members in the period of a few hours compared to dozens in days prior, following Tumblr's announcement of intent in early December 2018 to ban all sensitive content from their site. Many left-leaning Indian users shifted to Mastodon from Twitter after complaining that Twitter moderated only the accounts of lower castes.  Forks  In 2017, Pixiv launched a Mastodon- based social network named \\"Pawoo\\". However, the service was acquired by another Japanese company, Russell, in 2019. In April 2019, computer manufacturer Purism released a fork of Mastodon named Librem Social. Gab, a controversial social network with a far-right user base, changed its software platform to a fork of Mastodon and became the largest Mastodon node in July 2019. Gab's adoption of Mastodon allowed Gab to be accessed from third-party Mastodon applications, although four of them blocked Gab shortly after the change. In response, Mastodon stated that it was \\"completely opposed to Gab‚Äôs project and philosophy\\", and criticized Gab for attempting \\"to monetize and platform racist content while hiding behind the banner of free speech\\" and for \\"paywalling basic features that are freely available on Mastodon\\". In October 2019, the Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corporation released a fork of Mastodon named Civiq.Social.

He was a key figure in historic civil rights events taking place in Mississippi, including the Jackson Woolworth‚Äôs sit-in of 1963 and the Freedom Summer project in 1964. Rev. King held the position of Chaplain and Dean of Students, 1963‚Äì1967, at Tougaloo College in Jackson, Mississippi. At this critical juncture of the civil rights movement, historian John Dittmer described King as ‚Äúthe most visible white activist in the Mississippi movement.‚Äù As Tougaloo College chaplain, King collaborated with many of the key figures in the civil rights movement, including Bob Moses and others from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Medgar Evers of the NAACP, James Farmer and David Dennis of CORE, Dr. Martin Luther King of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and activists from the Mississippi COFO (Council of Federated Organizations), including Fannie Lou Hamer, Lawrence Guyot, and John Salter. King was also a co-founder of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), a member of the Democratic National Committee, and a delegate to three Democratic National Conventions. He and other surviving MFDP delegates were honored at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston on the 40th anniversary of their efforts to end racial discrimination in the Democratic party. Early life King was born on September 20, 1936, in Vicksburg, Mississippi, to Ralph Edwin King Sr. and Julia Wilma Tucker King. His father, whose family came from West Virginia and Louisiana, was an engineer with the Mississippi River Commission. His mother‚Äôs family had deep roots in the antebellum history of Mississippi. King‚Äôs great-grandfather had served under General Robert E. Lee, and his grandfather, J.W. Tucker, was sheriff of Warren County, Mississippi. As a youngster growing up in historic Vicksburg, King was deeply moved by stories of the deprivation his family suffered during what was called the ‚ÄúYankee torture‚Äù of the besieged city near the end of the Civil War. Ed spent many hours at the Vicksburg battleground, reflecting on the great costs of war. While still in his teens, he was drawn to pacifism and became an admirer of Mahatma Gandhi. Later, he recalled that pacifism came to him much earlier than more progressive attitudes about race. A good but not overly distinguished student, King was never subjected to standardized testing until his senior year at Carr Central High School. Suffering a sinus infection while taking the SAT test, he was convinced he‚Äôd done poorly and would never be admitted to Millsaps College, a popular destination for high achievers. ‚ÄúTwo weeks later I learned I had won a scholarship,\\" King said, \\"having probably placed second or third in the state.‚Äù Education Millsaps College (1954‚Äì1958) While still in high school, King attended church youth meetings at Millsaps College, a Methodist liberal arts school in Jackson. He never considered going to any college other than Millsaps, where, as a student, he was to witness firsthand the depth of white resistance to the Supreme Court‚Äôs landmark desegregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education. As an undergraduate at Millsaps, King attended all-white Citizens' Councils meetings and was dismayed to see how white moderates were forced into silence. He also participated in interracial meetings at nearby Tougaloo College, where he met Medgar Evers and other prominent black civil rights leaders. Other important influences for King at Millsaps were sociology chair Ernst Borinski (a refugee from Nazi Germany), vocal critic of segregation George Maddox, and philosophy chair Robert Bergmark. Boston University (1958‚Äì1963) After graduating from Millsaps in 1958, King left Mississippi to attend Boston University School of Theology, where he became a regular participant in interdisciplinary meetings of religious, pacifist, and civil rights activists. In December 1958, he met Martin Luther King Jr. in Montgomery, Alabama, starting a friendship that led to his involvement in the planning of the 1960 civil rights sit-ins with Rev. Jim Lawson of the Fellowship of Reconciliation. It was in Montgomery in March 1960 that Ed King was first arrested for acts of civil disobedience. King received two degrees from Boston University: Master of Divinity (1961) and Master of Sacred Theology (1963). Other education King also attended the University of Michigan (summer 1956) and Harvard Divinity School (on a Merrill Fellowship, 1966). Activism Roots of dissent Like the majority of middle-class white Southerners of his era, King was raised to embrace a noblesse oblige attitude toward blacks. He would later describe this as ‚Äúa practice that manifested itself in occasional donations of used clothing or holiday baskets of food or a comfortable paternalism that allowed many whites to believe that their duties‚Äîas Christians or otherwise‚Äîtoward their black neighbors had been satisfied.‚Äù Early arrests In March 1960, Ed King took leave from his seminary studies to volunteer in Montgomery, Alabama, where, on behalf of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, he helped organize secret interracial meetings where black students could mingle with white ministers and students from Huntingdon College. At this point, King preferred to work behind the scenes, building bridges between blacks and whites. He had made it clear to the Fellowship that he didn't want to take part in sit-ins or other activities that could result in his arrest‚Äîand bring notoriety that would prevent him from becoming the pastor of a white church in Mississippi. But the course of events led in another direction. While attending a lunch-time meeting at the black-owned Regal Cafe, King was arrested along with 20 other people‚Äîincluding Rev. Ralph Abernathy‚Äîby police targeting activists affiliated with the SCLC. The local press played up the presence of \\"northern agitators\\" at the restaurant, including a young minister from Boston. Represented in court by civil rights attorneys Fred Grey and Clifford Durr, all of the arrested were found guilty of \\"disturbing the peace.\\" Native white southerners, Durr and his wife convinced King that the arrest and imprisonment of white ministers would be of great benefit to the civil rights movement. When the national media picked up on the story, repercussions from the arrest were felt by King‚Äôs family in Vicksburg, who were horrified to see a photo of their son on the Today show. Years later, King wrote, \\"My father was calm but angry as he condemned my foolishness and the people who had 'misled' me.\\" White Methodist church leaders in Mississippi told the Kings that their son was under the influence of liberal Communist teachers who had infiltrated the seminary at Boston University. Others in the community believed King's parents were also culpable. ‚ÄúAlthough his parents did not share King‚Äôs beliefs and remained segregationists themselves, they were the subject of attacks by the Citizens' Councils and the John Birch Society. Neighbors and fellow church members shunned the couple.‚Äù A second arrest in Montgomery followed on June 7, this time the result of a deliberate action planned by King and attorney Fred Grey. King invited Rev. Elroy Embry, a black Methodist clergyman, to dine with him at the Plantation Dining Room in the Jefferson Davis Hotel, where the younger man was staying. Alerted to the meeting, the police arrested the two ministers, both of whom were subsequently convicted of disorderly conduct and trespassing. King and Embry were each sentenced to two weeks of service on a prison work gang. (A local newspaper published a photo of Ed King wearing the striped work clothing routinely issued to prisoners.) The arrests and King‚Äôs growing involvement in civil rights activities effectively ended any hopes the young minister might have had of serving a white Methodist church in his home state. Tougaloo College With their hopes of a future in Mississippi in doubt after his arrests, Ed King and his wife Jeannette, a Jackson native, considered putting down roots in Massachusetts. But events unfolding around the admission of James Meredith to Ole Miss inspired the couple to return to Mississippi to take part in a growing civil rights movement that was now centered in their home state. In 1962, Ernst Borinski alerted King that the chaplaincy of Tougaloo College was vacant and urged him to apply for the post. Medgar Evers was more direct about the opportunity: ‚ÄúYou have to come back because we need you, because this, my friend, is your calling.‚Äù Any resentment over hiring a white Southern man as the chaplain of a predominately black student body was deflected by King‚Äôs history as a civil rights activist who was willing to put himself at risk. His arrests for defying Jim Crow laws made him a relevant candidate: ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt have done it [become Chaplain] if I had not had a prison record,‚Äù King later wrote. As chaplain, King expected that he would provide background support for student activists, but once again he was propelled into a more active role by events that made Tougaloo the unofficial capital of the civil rights movement in Mississippi. Jackson Woolworth‚Äôs sit-in In 1963, King played a part in an act of civil disobedience that gave the movement some of its most iconic images. On May 28, he and a small group of Tougaloo students and faculty drove 10 miles to downtown Jackson, joining multiracial demonstrators attempting to dine at a whites-only lunch counter in the Woolworth's store near the Governor‚Äôs mansion. As one of several demonstrations planned with guidance from Medgar Evers of the NAACP, the sit-in was a small-scale challenge to the Jim Crow custom of denying black Americans their most basic rights. King had been assigned the role of ‚Äúspotter,‚Äù so he could avoid arrest and provide regular, live telephone reports to John Salter and Evers, who were monitoring the action from the Jackson NAACP office. Wearing his ministerial clerical collar (often called a bullet-proof vest by members of SNCC), King stood behind three black students, Anne Moody, Pearlina Lewis, and Memphis Norman, who had volunteered to sit at the lunch counter. News of the sit-in spread quickly, and soon a large crowd of whites descended on the store. The mob crowded the aisles near the counter, screaming obscenities, dumping condiments on the students, and even punching and kicking demonstrators. As the confrontation escalated, King phoned Evers to report what was happening at the counter. The police gathered outside the building made no attempt to curb the violence. The only people taken into custody were several whites picketing outside (including King‚Äôs wife Jeanette, arrested for blocking the sidewalk). At one point, King went outside to confront Police Captain John Lee Ray and plead for the police to protect the demonstrators. Ray refused, claiming that the Supreme Court‚Äôs desegregation ruling prevented officers of the law from interfering unless a store manager requested help. King rushed back into the store to ask management to intervene, but was unable to find anyone who would admit to being in charge. He then phoned Tougaloo College's president, Dr. A.D. Beittel, who in turn asked national church leaders to help bring Woolworth‚Äôs corporate executives into the conversation. The situation wasn‚Äôt defused until three hours later, when local management finally closed the store on orders from the national headquarters in New York City. A few weeks later‚Äîand just six days after the assassination of Medgar Evers in Jackson‚ÄîEd King and John Salter were injured in a suspicious car crash‚Äîvictims of what official police records called a traffic accident. The crash shattered King's jaw, causing disfiguring facial damage that would require numerous surgeries over the next 12 years. Freedom Vote and campaign for Lieutenant Governor In 1963, very few black citizens were registered to vote in the American South. To demonstrate that black Americans were willing and able to participate in the electoral process, civil rights activists invited the state‚Äôs black population to participate in the Freedom Vote, a non-binding mock election scheduled to take place in parallel with the 1963 Mississippi gubernatorial race between two white establishment candidates, Paul B. Johnson Jr. and Rubel Phillips. In October 1963, SNCC organizer and voting rights activist Bob Moses asked King to become the Freedom Vote candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi and running mate of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) candidate for Governor, black pharmacist Aaron Henry. King and Henry campaigned side by side at traditional sites of Mississippi political rallies, including the base of the Washington County Confederate Memorial statue near the courthouse in Greenville. Over 80,000 black Mississippians participated in the mock election, casting votes at local churches, beauty parlors, and a handful of black-owned service stations across the state. SNCC was joined by Al Lowenstein in promoting the campaign and enlisting students from Stanford and Yale to help after local staff had been jailed. The Freedom Vote successfully demonstrated the desire of black Americans to vote when free from the fear of harassment by whites. Freedom Summer Building on the success of the Freedom Vote, King become a leading organizer of Freedom Summer (1964), a volunteer campaign to help black Mississippians reclaim their right to vote, a basic civil right they were denied by Jim Crow societal barriers built into the voter registration process and other discriminatory laws and regulations. Over 1,000 volunteers from all over the country‚Äîmostly white college students‚Äîcame to Mississippi to help canvas black communities, encouraging people to register and instructing them in the process. As local organizers for Freedom Summer and the MFDP, Ed and Jeannette King were heavily involved with the voter registration initiative, the formation of Freedom Schools, and the MFDP challenge to the legitimacy of the Mississippi Democratic party, which limited participation to whites at a time when blacks made up 40 percent of the state‚Äôs population. To extend its reach to the local black population, the project set up Freedom Houses to shelter volunteers and established community centers in small towns throughout Mississippi. Historian John Dittmer observed that by the summer of 1964, Ed King had become \\"the most visible white activist in the Mississippi [civil rights] movement, and he paid a heavy price for honoring his convictions.\\" Since becoming a civil rights activist, King had been arrested and jailed, beaten, and even hospitalized with injuries related to an attempt on his life. Ed King actively worked to disrupt and desegregate white churches that had helped create the conditions that made Freedom Summer necessary. He believed that \\"[i]f white moderates, stirred by a Christian conscience ‚Ä¶ began to support any kind of change in racial patterns in Jackson ‚Ä¶ then the door was open, not just the church door, but the door to the possibilities of moderate, gradual change in all Mississippi.\\" King‚Äôs focus was on getting white moderates across the state involved while preventing an eruption of racial violence in response to the federally-mandated integration of public schools scheduled for the fall of 1964. MFDP challenge at the 1964 Democratic National Convention Recognizing that state officials had made it almost impossible to register black voters as members of the traditional Democratic party, civil rights activists shifted their focus to building the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), through an alternative signup process that made registration simple and safe. By registering with the MFDP, black Mississippians were spared from having to submit to a literacy test designed to humiliate them, or trying to register at courthouses where white segregationists controlled the process. On August 6, 1964, the MFDP held a statewide convention in which membership decided to mount a challenge to the credentials of the Mississippi Democratic party by naming their own alternate slate of electors to attend the Democratic National Convention scheduled to take place in Atlantic City, New Jersey, later in the month. Ed King was elected as National Committeeman and a member of the MFDP leadership, along with Victoria Gray, Lawrence Guyot, Fannie Lou Hamer, and Aaron Henry. Despite unrelenting pressure from the White Citizens‚Äô Council and other Jim Crow supporters, the MFDP elected 68 delegates to the Democratic National Convention. (Of the four whites on the delegate list, three were connected to Tougaloo College.) Soon after arriving In Atlantic City, the MFDP challenged the right of the Mississippi Democratic party's delegation to participate in the convention because the delegates had been elected illegally, as part of a segregated process violating both party regulations and federal law. The MFDP asked the Credentials Committee to seat its own slate of delegates instead of the white-only regulars. At the official hearing, MFDP speakers included Fannie Lou Hamer, Aaron Henry, Ed King, Martin Luther King, and Rita Schwerner. Hamer gave an emotionally charged speech, describing how her attempt to register as a voter resulted in the loss of her job, eviction from her home, and a savage beating‚Äîa testimony that galvanized voters across the nation, bringing considerable pressure upon the Democratic party. Despite evidence that most Democrats favored ousting the regular delegates, party leadership feared that delegations from other Southern states would bolt the party if the MFDP challenge was successful. The political jockeying was intense. At the same time the Credentials Committee was meeting, MFDP delegates Aaron Henry and Ed King were closeted in a hotel room with COFO (Council of Federated Organizations) chair Bob Moses, trying to fashion a compromise with Hubert Humphrey, Walter Reuther; the attached image here is NOT of Walter Reuther, however! Bayard Rustin, Martin Luther King, and Andrew Young. In an effort to defuse the controversy, party leaders, acting on behalf of President Lyndon Johnson offered the MFDP two at-large seats to be filled by Aaron Henry and Ed King. Believing it was paternalistic of Johnson to name the two at-large delegates instead of allowing the delegates to vote on the two-seat proposal and choose who should represent them, Ed King offered a counterproposal that gave MFDP delegates more of a voice at the convention. \\"In his comparatively mild manner, he [King] pushed for a modification in the compromise: Break the two at-large votes in half, then apportion the four half-votes to Henry, King, Fannie Lou Hamer, and another Negro woman, Victoria Gray.\\" Humphrey rejected the proposal, insisting that President Johnson was adamantly opposed to allowing an ‚Äúilliterate woman‚Äù (Hamer) to speak on the floor of the Democratic Convention. Afterwards, Aaron Henry said about the offer: \\"Now, Lyndon made the typical white man's mistake: Not only did he say, 'You've got two votes,' which was too little, but he told us to whom the two votes would go. He'd give me one and Ed King one; that would satisfy. ‚Ä¶ But now, what kind of fool am I, or what kind of fool would Ed have been, to accept gratuities for ourselves?\\" The MFDP delegation refused the offer and left the convention rather than be forced to accept token representation. National media condemned the MFDP for being na√Øve and unready for political participation, insisting that the time was past for protest. MFDP National Committeeman and delegate to DNC From 1964 to 1968, King served as MFDP National Committeeman with Victoria Gray as Committeewoman, on the Democratic National Committee. He was also served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1968 and 1972. In 2004, at the Democratic National Convention held in Boston, Massachusetts, delegates recognized the 40th anniversary of the MFDP challenge by honoring Fannie Lou Hamer, Ed King and the other \\"outlaw\\" delegates who championed desegregation of the Democratic party. 1966 Third District Congressional race In 1966, Ed King was nominated as MFDP candidate for the Third District Congressional seat. Rev. King ran against incumbent John Bell Williams as part of another interracial ticket with Rev. Clifton Whitley. Ed King received 22 percent of vote, the best showing of any MFDP candidate that year. Delta Ministry In 1967, King left Tougaloo to devote himself to the Delta Ministry, the church group he founded to support the Freedom Summer initiative. The Delta Ministry would grow into a longer-term project promoting the economic development of the Mississippi Delta region. Methodist Board of Missions In 1970, King joined the Methodist Board of Missions (later known as Global Ministries) as a special envoy giving lectures and sermons in New York and India, where he and his family lived during 1971 while King was involved with nonviolence development research at the Mahatma Gandhi Peace Foundation in New Delhi. ACLU leadership From 1973 to 1977, King served as president of the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi and a member of the ACLU‚Äôs National Board. Recent years King continues to lecture extensively on his experiences during the civil rights movement and is a frequent participant in political seminars. He has spoken at universities and churches throughout the U.S., as well as in Afghanistan and Moscow. He also assists in worship services at Galloway United Methodist Church in Jackson. Ed King's Mississippi: Behind the Scenes of Freedom Summer In 2014, Ed King collaborated with Trent Watts on Ed King's Mississippi: Behind the Scenes of Freedom Summer, a book documenting civil rights activities in Mississippi during 1964. In addition to King's personal accounts of pivotal events in his home state, the book includes dozens of previously unpublished photographs taken by the minister, including informal images of Martin Luther King Jr., Andrew Young, and Mississippi civil rights workers.  In popular culture  Rev. Ed King has been portrayed in several dramatic treatments of landmark events associated with the civil rights movement.  Play  King appears as a character in All the Way, a Robert Schenkkan play depicting the first year of Lyndon Johnson's presidency, with an emphasis on events surrounding the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. After successful passage of the historic legislation, Johnson's bid to retain the White House in the 1964 presidential election is complicated by turmoil at the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, where the upstart Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party bids to unseat the all-white, official delegation that claims to represent the state. All the Way captured the 2014 Tony Award for Outstanding Play, and Bryan Cranston, in the role of Lyndon B. Johnson, won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. Ethan Phillips portrays Rev. King in a pivotal scene in which Hubert Humphrey presents the President's compromise solution that gives the renegades two at-large seats at the convention. > EDWIN KING I don‚Äôt, uh, feel comfortable being the representative here in > place of the grass-roots leadership. Maybe I should step aside, let Mrs. > Hamer take my place. SENATOR HUBERT HUMPHREY The President is insisting on > your presence Edwin because he wants an interracial delegation! EDWIN KING > I‚Äôm sure that Mrs. Hamer has to be a part of this. SENATOR HUBERT HUMPHREY > The President has said that he will not let that illiterate woman speak on > the floor of the Democratic convention.  Film  All the Way is a 2016 drama based on the historic events of 1964, the first year of the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson. Originally broadcast on HBO, the film was directed by Jay Roach and adapted by Robert Schenkkan from his original play of the same name. Bryan Cranston reprised his role as Johnson from the 2014 Broadway production of the play. Gregory Marcel portrays Rev. Ed King in a version of the scene from the play in which Hubert Humphrey offers the President's compromise solution to the renegade delegation.  Awards  * John F.

As such, she earned the first doctorate secured by a woman and was the first university-trained Greek woman to become a teacher. Always an advocate of women's education, she wrote articles in journals and magazines, as well as proposing laws to the Hellenic Parliament for educational reform. As a school inspector, she traveled throughout Greece and made an extended trip traveling throughout the United States to study educational systems. Early life Sevasti Kallisperi was born in 1858 in Athens to Nicholas and Marigo Kallisperi. Her father, originally from Kalymnos, was an officer in the Greek War of Independence and after the establishment of the modern Greek state held several prominent positions, including Inspector of the Public Schools of Samos (1830), where he founded several primary schools; judge of Athens (1844); and the Prefect of Messenia (1855). The couple had three children and were staunch supporters of education. Kallisperi's brother George would also become a soldier and later served in the 1897 Greco-Turkish War. Kallisperi was enrolled in the Hill Girls' School, a highly regarded, private girl's school. At the time, the Greek government position was that girls need not be educated and public schools were open only to male students. What few private schools were available provided courses designed to teach girls how to manage a home and be wives and mothers. If they attended a private secondary school, women's courses had a shorter duration than instruction in public secondary schools for boys and upon completion were granted a diploma, which did not meet university entrance requirements. The diploma issued only allowed women to participate in social work and as teachers. After graduating from Hill with her diploma, Kallisperi was privately tutored to ensure that her preparation was equivalent to male students' training. In 1884, she applied to enter Athens University and though not in favor of women's higher education, Kallisperi was allowed to take the entrance examination for philosophy. The examination was conducted by ten professors of the university. After passing the exam, the Ministry of Education refused to validate the signatures of the instructors who had conducted it, thus denying Kallisperi's entrance to the university. Appealing the process, the mayor of Athens validated the signatures and granted her a public high school diploma, but her entrance to the university was still denied. She applied for a scholarship to further her education abroad, but the government had no funds to grant the request. In 1885, her father agreed to send her to The Sorbonne in Paris. Arriving in Paris, Kallisperi had to pass another examination and was then admitted to the department of philosophy. She graduated 1891, with a doctorate degree, becoming the first Greek woman to earn a university degree. She graduated with honors in her class of 139 students, in which she was the only woman. After completing her degree, Kallisperi completed internships in schools of S√®vres and Cambridge, before returning to Greece. Career In 1892, upon her return to Greece, Kallisperi was employed at the Arsakeio school as a French instructor. Between 1895 and 1898, she also taught Greek at the school. During the same time frame, Kallisperi privately taught girls in her home in ethics, history, Greek and French literature, and psychology. In 1895, she resigned her post at Arsakeio and accepted a position as an education inspector for girls' schools, traveling throughout Greece. She was the only woman inspector in the country. She began publishing articles on methods to improve education, which included proposals for training both teachers and providing skills for other trades in addition to basic education. In 1897, The Family Journal published her paper, Œ†ŒµœÅŒØ ŒºŒµœÑŒ±œÅœÅœÖŒ∏ŒºŒØœÉŒµœâœÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ≥œÖŒΩŒ±ŒπŒ∫ŒµŒØŒøœÖ ŒïŒ∫œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒµœÖœÑŒπŒ∫Œøœç œÉœÖœÉœÑŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ (For reforming of the women's educational system). That same year, Kallisperi joined with other feminists to found the Union for Women's Education and began publishing in such journals as Thalia and Euridice. She expanded on these ideas in 1899, submitting two bills to parliament urging improved education for women and in 1904 at the First Hellenic Educational Conference proposed that practical skills such as beekeeping, silk worm farming, gardening and others. In 1906, she was sent by the Greek government as a delegate to the triennial World Woman's Christian Temperance Union convention in Boston. Part of her trip to the United States was to be spent evaluating public schools in Boston, Philadelphia and New York for ideas which might be brought to bear in Greece. She remained in the United States for five years, visiting Greek communities in Ohio, Colorado and Utah to study agricultural trade schools, before returning to Washington, D. C. to attend the 1908 Mother's Congress. Returning to Greece, Kallisperi wrote articles for publication and drafted laws to improve the educational system in Greece. In addition to her calls for improvement in education, she also wrote analyses of ancient Greek literature, translated foreign plays, as well as writing poetry and publishing her memoirs. Death and legacy Kallisperi died in 1953 at her home in Athens. Between 1907 and 1919, Kallisperi and her brother George bought 4 adjacent lots in Athens and erected several buildings upon them, beginning with a neoclassical house begun in 1911. Upon Kalisperi's death, she willed the home to the Greek Government to establish a foundation to help girls' education. The government never created the foundation and the property stood abandoned for several decades, until it was taken over by the Halandri High School for Girls. Later the property passed to the Municipality of Halandri and in 2010 the process began for the property to be declared a protected monument. The status was finally approved in 2012.

GNMT improves on the quality of translation by applying an example- based (EBMT) machine translation method in which the system \\"learns from millions of examples\\". GNMT's proposed architecture of system learning was first tested on over a hundred languages supported by Google Translate. With the large end-to-end framework, the system learns over time to create better, more natural translations. GNMT is capable of translating whole sentences at a time, rather than just piece by piece. The GNMT network can undertake interlingual machine translation by encoding the semantics of the sentence, rather than by memorizing phrase-to-phrase translations.  History  The Google Brain project was established in 2011 in the \\"secretive Google X research lab\\" by Google Fellow Jeff Dean, Google Researcher Greg Corrado, and Stanford University Computer Science professor Andrew Ng. Ng's work has led to some of the biggest breakthroughs at Google and Stanford. In September 2016, a research team at Google announced the development of the Google Neural Machine Translation system (GNMT) and by November Google Translate began using neural machine translation (NMT) in preference to its previous statistical methods (SMT) which had been used since October 2007, with its proprietary, in-house SMT technology.Google Switches to its Own Translation System, October 22, 2007 Google Translate's NMT system uses a large artificial neural network capable of deep learning. By using millions of examples, GNMT improves the quality of translation, using broader context to deduce the most relevant translation. The result is then rearranged and adapted to approach grammatically based human language. GNMT's proposed architecture of system learning was first tested on over a hundred languages supported by Google Translate. GNMT did not create its own universal interlingua but rather aimed at commonality found in between many languages, considered to be of more interest to psychologists and linguists than to computer scientists. The new translation engine was first enabled for eight languages: to and from English and French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish in 2016. In March 2017, three additional languages were enabled: Russian, Hindi and Vietnamese along with Thai for which support was added later. Support for Hebrew and Arabic was also added with help from the Google Translate Community in the same month. In mid April 2017 Google Netherlands announced support for Dutch and other European languages related to English. Further support was added for nine Indian languages: Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada at the end of April 2017.  Evaluation  The GNMT system is said to represent an improvement over the former Google Translate in that it will be able handle \\"zero-shot translation\\", that is it directly translates one language into another (for example, Japanese to Korean). Google Translate previously first translated the source language into English and then translated the English into the target language rather than translating directly from one language to another. A July 2019 study in Annals of Internal Medicine found that \\"Google Translate is a viable, accurate tool for translating non‚ÄìEnglish-language trials\\". Only one disagreement between reviewers reading machine-translated trials was due to a translation error. Since many medical studies are excluded from systematic reviews because the reviewers do not understand the language, GNMT has the potential to reduce bias and improve accuracy in such reviews.  Languages supported by GNMT  As at October 2020 the number of languages supported by Google Translate rose to 109 with Kyrgrz, Belariusan , Latin , Maltese and Sudanese now included #Afrikaans #Albanian #Amharic #Arabic #Armenian #Azerbaijani #Basque #Belarusian #Bengali #Bosnian #Bulgarian #Burmese #Catalan #Cebuano #Chichewa #Chinese (Simplified) #Chinese (Traditional) #Corsican #Croatian #Czech #Danish #Dutch #English #Esperanto #Estonian #Filipino #Finnish #French #Galician #Georgian #German #Greek #Gujarati #Haitian Creole #Hausa #Hawaiian #Hebrew #Hindi #Hmong #Hungarian #Icelandic #Igbo #Indonesian #Irish #Italian #Japanese #Javanese #Kannada #Kazakh #Khmer #Korean #Kurdish (Kurmanji) #Lao #Latvian #Lithuanian #Luxembourgish #Macedonian #Malagasy #Malay #Malayalam #Maltese #Maori #Marathi #Mongolian #Nepali #Norwegian (Bokm√•l) #Pashto #Persian #Polish #Portuguese #Punjabi #Romanian #Russian #Samoan #Scots Gaelic #Serbian #Sesotho #Shona #Sindhi #Sinhala #Slovak #Slovenian #Somali #Spanish #Sundanese #Swahili #Swedish #Tajik #Tamil #Telugu #Thai #Turkish #Ukrainian #Urdu #Uzbek #Vietnamese #Welsh #West Frisian #Xhosa #Yiddish #Yoruba #Zulu  See also  *Example-based machine translation *Rule-based machine translation *Comparison of machine translation applications *Statistical machine translation *Artificial intelligence *Cache language model *Computational linguistics *Computer-assisted translation *History of machine translation *List of emerging technologies *List of research laboratories for machine translation *Neural machine translation *Machine translation *Universal translator  References   External links  *Google‚Äôs Neural Machine Translation System: Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation *The Advantages and Disadvantages of Machine Translation *Statistical Machine Translation *International Association for Machine Translation (IAMT) *Machine Translation Archive by John Hutchins.

Voice against Casteism Satyendra Murli a journalist with Doordarshan passionately spoke of double standards in the media. He argues, \\"If so-called lower caste or Dalit journalists raise their voice against the casteism, they are accused of being casteist and the ones actually perpetuating this casteism actually become national journalists\\" He strongly urged journalists to stand together on issues of casteism and reservation. Controversies Satyendra Murli was criticised for raises issues relating to women had only shared a cartoon showing Mahatma Gandhi with a few women in the month of June 2012 on his Facebook account but soon a case was lodged against him under various sections charging him of insulting the Father of the Nation. He raised women issues, he wrote a comment under the cartoon, ‚ÄòAre Indian women not awaken this much that they could raise voice against exploitation. Soon, Congress led Rajasthan state government committee lodged a case (dated 6 June 2012) under sections 67, 67 A of IT Act, 4 and 6 of Indecent Representative of Women (Prohibition) Act and 292 of Indian Penal Code against Satyendra Murli. He sent a clarification to the police. However, the police raided his house. In his absence, they tortured his family persons and took his bike. On 24 November 2016, Doordarshan journalist Satyendra Murli, claimed that the Prime Minister‚Äôs ‚Äòlive‚Äô address had actually been pre-recorded and edited. At a press conference held at the Press Club of India in New Delhi, Satyendra Murli alleged that Narendra Modi misled the citizens of the country by recording the announcement and took a unilateral decision to demonetise notes, which made up over 85 per cent in circulation. He has filed an RTI requesting this information be made public. According to Satyendra Murli, Modi's 8 November address was not live, but recorded and edited. It had been written many days before the RBI's proposal (not decision), on the subject at 6 p.m. of 8 November and the briefing of the Cabinet by Modi at 7 p.m. Modi's address was broadcast at 8:15 p.m. with a live band, to create the impression that the decision had been taken suddenly, and the public would believe that the matter had been kept fully secret, but it was certainly not so. Whether the Government of India rules under Transaction of Business Rules, 1961 and the RBI Act, 1934, have been followed, is a moot question.

The unit originates as Shabiha, a criminal organization that has operated in Latakia Governorate since the 1980s, and only adopted its current name and appearance in 2015. Since then, the Lions of Hussein reportedly continued their \\"criminal activities on the side\\".  History   Muhammad al-Assad's Shabiha  The Lions of Hussein began as the personal gang of Muhammad Tawfiq al-Assad, a native of Qardaha and member of the wider Al-Assad family. In the 1980s, the group ran smuggling networks throughout Latakia, dealt in contraband as well as drugs, and was reportedly involved in kidnappings, extortion and theft. Between 1989 and 1994, they operated as government-sanctioned Shabiha, with Mohammed amassing millions of Syrian pounds and becoming notorious and feared as smuggler and ‚Äúhighway robber (ŸÇÿ∑ÿπ ÿßŸÑÿ∑ÿ±ŸäŸÇ; qata‚Äô al-tariq)‚Äù. According to a Syrian opposition source, the activities of the group became so excessive that Bassel al-Assad had Muhammad and some of his aides thrown into prison, though they were eventually released on the orders of Bashar al-Assad. As the Syrian economy opened up, Muhammad adopted a more legal persona, entered business and bought a PhD for himself, though kept his criminal network and fief around Qardaha. After the outbreak of the civil war in 2011, Muhammad led the recruitment of new members for Shabiha militias in Latakia. According to an opposition source, Muhammad and his men committed various unspecified atrocities in course of the conflict, causing frictions among the powerful Alawite families of Latakia. Many clans feared possible rebel reprisals due to the actions of the Shabiha, and in October 2012 this reportedly caused an armed dispute between Muhammad and a member of the Khayyir family. Initially affiliated with the al-Bustan Association, Muhammad's private militia started to closely cooperate with the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in 2014. Counting about 1,000 fighters at the time, the group mostly fought in northern and eastern Latakia, and was responsible for the protection of Qardaha. Muhammad was eventually killed on 12 March 2015, when he was either ambushed and shot by a rival or killed during another dispute. After his death, his followers reportedly brought his body to the frontline at Doreen in northern Latakia and went on to claim that he had died fighting rebels. A Free Syrian Army senior commander however denied that rebel forces had killed Muhammad. According to a Syrian Army soldier Muhammad had been killed just after the government had asked him to form a paramilitary unit.  Reorganization under Hussein's leadership  After Muhammad's death, his son, Hussein Tawfiq al-Assad, took control of the criminal network and its armed contingent. He went on to rebrand and reorganize it as official paramilitary unit, and around late June/early July 2015 officially \\"founded\\" the \\"Lions of Hussein Brigade\\". According to regional expert Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, the new name of the group could be understood as referring both to Hussein Tawfiq al- Assad himself as well as Imam Husayn ibn Ali. The reorganization aimed at reducing the group's previous negative image that had resulted from its association with Muhammad's criminal activities. According to 2017 reports by the Austrian Armed Forces' Truppendienst magazine and a Clingendael Institute researcher the militia became part of the Russian-backed and Republican Guard- led 4th Corps. A commander of the Lions of Hussein later denied any affiliation with the 4th Corps or Russia. The Lions of Hussein consequently fought for the government in various war zones, participating in the Palmyra offensive (July‚ÄìAugust 2015) against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the Al-Ghab offensive (July‚ÄìAugust 2015), the offensive to recapture Marj al-Sultan airbase in late 2015, and the 2015‚Äì16 Latakia offensive. Meanwhile, the unit reportedly continues its \\"criminal activities on the side\\". Around February 2016, the unit underwent another reformation and reconstitution, adopting a new name: \\"Guardians of Syria Forces - Lions of Hussein\\". This was due to the group absorbing 200 fighters who had links to the Russian forces in Syria. At the time, the militia was stationed near Kinsabba, and enjoyed the public support of various Alawite sheikhs. By March, the Lions were active in eastern Aleppo. The Lions of Hussein also launched a recruitment campaign in June 2016, promising recruits 50,000 Syrian pounds ($230) for fighting in the Latakia region, and 80,000 pounds ($360) for fighting in Palmyra. Furthermore, the group continued to strengthen its ties to the Revolutionary Guard, developing an \\"official affiliation\\" with it during 2016. It also joined the Latakia branch of the Iranian-backed Local Defence Forces. Alongside other units of the Local Defence Forces, the Lions of Hussein helped to break the Siege of Deir ez-Zor, closely cooperating with the Tiger Forces during the battle for the city in late 2017. Following the Eastern Syria campaign (September‚ÄìDecember 2017)'s conclusion, the group was among the units left to secure Mayadin and Abu Kamal Districts against remnants of ISIL. Equipment The Lions of Hussein are considered to be \\"well armed\\"; their primary weapons appear to be AKMs and AK-74s, while they employ technicals as improvised fighting vehicles. The group also possesses heavy weapons, such as RPG-7s, 9K111 Fagot or 9M113 Konkurs rocket launchers and at least one tank.

William de Lindholme) is a legendary figure in English folklore, who lived in a hermitage on an island (an area now called Lindholme) in the middle of the Hatfield Chase, today located in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster. Many differing tales were told about William, from him being born a Giant, to him being either a Satanic Magician or a Righteous Monk. What can be extracted is that William was a real hermit, living in the Lindholme waste, likely where Rangjung Yeshe Gomde Tibetan Buddhist Centre now stands.  Earliest Reports  The earliest report of William comes from the will of John Symson of Fish Lake, dated to March 23, 1407, in which he bequeaths 7 pence to the hermit of Lindholme. According to the Yorkshire Archaeological Journal, the MSS of Dr. Nathaniel Johnston, which number over 100 volumes, contain information and references to the occupant of the hermitage at Lindholme. The diary of Rev. Abraham De La Pryme contains the following section about William: July 28, 1697 ‚ÄúHaving been in Yorkshire this last week, I met with diverse learned and ingenious gentlemen, who told me a great many observable things. It was upon Hanson‚Äôs house at Hale‚Äôs Hill, Woodhouse, that St. William a‚Äô Lindholme set his wagon. One Hanson lived there then. Look and see when the Hansons lived, and you may find perhaps when William a‚Äô Lindholme lived.‚Äù Investigative research done by William Brockhurst Stonehouse, published in his 1839 book \\"The History and Topography of the Isle of Axholme\\", uncovered that the burial stone of William of Lindholme was no longer there, however his burial place was still at that time visible. The stone having been broken down and used as cobblestone by a previous owner of the land. The burial stone was described by Antiquarian George Stovin, whom, according to an August 31, 1727 letter printed in the Gentleman's Magazine, exhumed William's body, he stated that the stone was 8¬Ω feet in length, 3 feet in breadth and 8 feet in thickness. He also described an altar on the opposite side of the island made of hewn stone. He also stated that upon exhuming his body they uncovered a skull, tooth and hip bone from a very large human, as well as the remains of a bag of hemp seed and a large beaten copper plate with two chevrons on it. He is held to have thrown the \\"thumb stone\\" and \\"little- finger stone\\" from Lindholme to Wroot, some three miles distant.

In 1875, he was elected probate judge of Edgefield County, South Carolina by the Republican Party which was in control of local politics there. In the fall of 1876 he was elected county sheriff, but was not granted the position. In 1877, reconstruction ended in that portion of South Carolina and Bouey and fellow black appointee, circuit court clerk Jesse Jones were pushed out of their positions. Bouey accused Matthew Butler of threatening to kill him, Paris Simpkins and Lawrence Cain in a speech during Butler's successful United States Senate campaign.1877 Congressional Record, Senate, page 759 Leaving politics, he then was ordained by the Macedonia Baptist Church in Edgefield Court House, South Carolina.

Ethics Office Director Walter Shaub Resigns, Saying Rules Need To Be Tougher. July 6, 20171:01 PM ET was the director of the United States Office of Government Ethics. As of July 19, 2017, he joined the Washington D.C.-based election law organization the Campaign Legal Center (CLC) as Senior Director, Ethics.  Career  Early career Shaub graduated from South Lakes High School in Reston, Virginia. He earned a B.A. degree in history from James Madison University, then earned his J.D. degree from American University Washington College of Law. From 1997 to 2004 he was an attorney in federal agencies including the Office of Government Ethics, the main office of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the Office of General Counsel of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Regional Counsel's office. In 2004, he became an attorney at the Shaw, Bransford, Veilleux and Roth law firm. Office of Government Ethics In 2006, Shaub joined the Office of Government Ethics to become the attorney in charge of the Presidential nomination program. He held this position for two years before becoming the Deputy General Counsel in 2008. In 2013, he was appointed by President Barack Obama to a five-year term as the director of the Office of Government Ethics. As Director, Shaub was outspoken with concerns about the Trump administration during the transition period before he took office. He delivered a speech on January 11, 2017 regarding concerns with the president-elect's refusal to divest his assets and, instead, place them in trust managed by his sons. Shaub was also the author of a series of tweets published on the Office of Government Ethics Twitter account, which gained media attention for breaking from the account's typically serious tone to mimic Donald Trump's tweeting style and congratulate him on his announcement that he would divest himself of his business assets. On April 28, 2017, Shaub issued a data call directing the White House, agency ethics officials, Inspectors General, and the White House to produce copies of the ethics waivers given to ex-lobbyists in the executive branch. Writing on behalf of the administration on May 17, 2017, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney sent Shaub a letter that seemed to question OGE's authority to collect the requested ethics records. Mulvaney sent copies of his letter to every General Counsel and every designated agency ethics official in the executive branch. On May 22, Shaub responded by sending a ten-page letter reasserting OGE's authority to collect ethics records, including ethics waivers, to Mulvaney, Shaub copied the same individuals Mulvaney had copied and added the inspectors general, as well as the six members of Congress responsible for government oversight, On May 26, Mulvaney sent a second letter denying that his first letter had questioned OGE's authority and, this time, providing the information requested by Shaub's original data call. Thereafter, on May 30, the White House complied with Shaub's data call by posting its waivers online. On August 1, Senators Chuck Grassley, Dianne Feinstein and Gary Peters sent a bipartisan letter to Mulvaney demanding that the White House continue releasing its waivers on a continuing basis. On September 21, OGE's acting Director, David Apol, issued a memorandum declaring that the White House would comply with this congressional request. On October 19, the White House released a second batch of waivers on its website. On July 6, 2017, Walter Shaub submitted his resignation, effective July 19, 2017, saying that ethics rules should be tighter. Campaign Legal Center After resigning as OGE director, Shaub joined the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan organization of election-law experts located in Washington DC. He serves as the Senior Director, Ethics. In that position Shaub said of the United States and the Trump administration, \\"[we] are pretty close to a laughingstock at this point.\\" In an interview with Judy Woodruff of PBS, Shaub was highly critical of the Trump Administration. He described, \\"the White House that has set a tone from the top that ethics doesn't matter.\\" He was highly critical of naming an acting director, to avoid the Senate confirmation process. Shaub is concerned that, under Trump, the United States government will be seen as a kleptocracy. Shaub maintains that Trump uses his hotels and other properties for government business, which Shaub maintains amounts to free advertising. Shaub said, \\"His actions create the appearance of profiting from the presidency, and the appearance here is everything, because the demand I'm making is so much more than 'have a clean heart'. It's: 'Have a clean heart and act appropriately,'\\"Trump makes US seem a 'kleptocracy', says ex- ethics chief Walter Shaub The Guardian Shaub has vocally supported the need for the investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. elections to remain independent of White House interference by President Donald Trump and his associates. On December 15, 2017, Shaub issued a warning to Trump, saying that \\"firing Mueller is a red line he must not cross.\\"  References   External links  * 1971 births Living people James Madison University alumni Obama administration personnel Trump administration personnel Washington College of Law alumni ","title":"Walter Shaub"},{"id":"52841400","text":"Richard Tomlins may refer to: * Richard Tomlins (politician) (1563‚Äì1650), Member of Parliament for Ludlow * Richard Tomlins (merchant) (1564?‚Äì1650), founder of the Readership in Anatomy at Oxford * Richard Tomlins (judge) (died after 1660), Baron of the Exchequer 1649‚Äì1660 ","title":"Richard Tomlins"},{"id":"52841419","text":"Ernst St√∂hr (1860‚Äì1917) was an Austrian painter, graphic artist, writer and amateur musician; one of the founding members of the Vienna Secession.  Biography  His father, Karl (1825‚Äì1909), was a violin maker and his uncle, Ludwig St√∂hr (1836‚Äì1902), who lived with his family, was a music teacher, composer and Director of the Sankt P√∂lten Musikvereins. As a child, he showed an aptitude for painting, poetry and music and was uncertain which one to pursue. He eventually chose painting and began his studies in 1877, at the University of Applied Arts Vienna. His multiple talents made him a popular guest in local society. He was displeased with the stiffly formal training at the University, however, and in 1879, switched to the Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied with and August Eisenmenger. Once again, he found himself at odds with his teachers, who were too wedded to the Romantic style. He persevered until 1887, when he began travelling between Sankt P√∂lten, Melk and Wochein, where his cousin, Friederike, ran a hotel. Eventually, financial problems forced him to return to Vienna. The St√∂hr-Haus in Sankt P√∂lten In 1895, he organized a successful exhibition of works by the recently deceased Theodor von H√∂rmann, an early critic of the Academy. The following year, he became a member of the K√ºnstlerhaus Wien. There, he joined the circle of young artists known as \\"Die Jungen\\", centered around Gustav Klimt. In 1897, he and seventeen other artists left the K√ºnstlerhaus to form the Vienna Secession. Over the years, he was a regular contributor to Ver Sacrum, the group's official publication. Later career and the loss of his family In 1898, he married Friederike and opened a studio in Wochien. That same year, he designed the fa√ßade for a house his brother Hermann (a doctor) was building in Sankt P√∂lten; now preserved as the St√∂hr-Haus. Later, he bought his own printing press to experiment with printing techniques. The 12th issue of Ver Sacrum was entirely his work. In 1902, he wrote the preface for the catalog accompanying the Secession's \\"\\". During this time, he was invited to become a guest member of the Hagenbund. Shortly after that exhibition, his beloved uncle, Ludwig, died and he went through a period of severe depression. In 1904, his mother became seriously ill and he returned to Sankt P√∂lten to help care for her. After she died, his father suffered through a long illness and died in 1909. Both events were followed by worsening episodes of depression, prompting him to seek relief in religion and philosophy. In 1915, Italy entered World War I, which placed Wochein within the war zone. His paintings, always rather melancholy, began to reflect his increasing despair; dealing largely with hopeless situations and death. In early 1917, he was taken to a hospital in Tulln an der Donau, but was released in a few weeks. Upon his release, he returned to Sankt P√∂lten, went to the family home, and hanged himself in the kitchen.
