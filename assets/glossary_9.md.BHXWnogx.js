He was the former chairman and CEO of the Ackerley Group media company. He was also the owner of the Seattle SuperSonics basketball franchise from 1983 to 2001 and the Seattle Storm basketball franchise from 2000 to 2001. History Born in Des Moines, Iowa in 1934, Barry Ackerley began his career in the advertising industry selling space for the magazine Better Homes & Gardens. In 1964, he approached a wealthy family in Wichita, Kansas, and asked for their financial assistance in acquiring billboards. The family agreed and, as a minority shareholder in the venture, Ackerley purchased billboards in Fresno and Bakersfield, California. Over the next four years, Ackerley purchased additional billboards in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose, California. By 1968, the billboards in northern California had generated enough income to provide Ackerley with the start-up capital he had lacked in New York five years earlier. He sold his interest in the venture back to his benefactors and, with a new partner, parlayed the proceeds toward the establishment of an outdoor advertising company, Golden West Outdoor Advertising. Golden West, had billboards in Sacramento, California, and in Colorado until 1974, when Ackerley purchased his partner's share in the company then sold the company to Gannett Company. With the money garnered from the sale to Gannett, Ackerley, after a brief return to the Northeast to work for an advertising firm, relocated to Seattle, Washington, in 1975 and purchased Seattle-based Foster & Kleiser from Metromedia Inc. and Obie Outdoor Advertising based in Eugene, Oregon. The acquisition of these two outdoor advertising companies formed the beginnings of Ackerley's new company, named Northwest Communications, Inc. in 1975 initially, and renamed Ackerley Communications, Inc. the following year. From there the new company would begin to acquire broadcast television stations and radio stations in the early 1980s. After mainly transitioning to a broadcast media company, the company would be sold to sold to Clear Channel CommunicationsFCC approves Clear Channel (now known as iHeartMedia) purchase of Ackerley Group in 2001 for $1.1 billion. =Seattle SuperSonics= In 1983 Ackerley purchased the Seattle SuperSonics of the National Basketball Association from original owner Sam Schulman. Ackerley began exploring new options for an arena. Heavy relocation rumors began to circulate, amongst them a potential move to San Diego or possible sales to groups in other markets like Milwaukee or Toronto. In 2018, Ackerley's son Chris would say that the family was always committed to keeping the team in Seattle, and that \\"in each case, we stood on our principles that this is a Seattle community asset.\\" Briefly, the Ackerleys talked about building an arena east of Lake Washington near the mall in Bellevue. They would eventually purchase land in the SoDo District near the Kingdome, some of which included the site that would become the Mariners' current home, T-Mobile Park. Ackerley approached the city about a public contribution to the new arena, but the city was reluctant over fears the city-owned Coliseum would become obsolete. They offered to help finance a renovation of the Coliseum, but the team owner declined. To sweeten the offer, Ackerley sold city leaders on the idea that the new arena in SoDo could also attract an NHL club. The city, along with Denver, had been conditionally granted an expansion NHL franchise in 1974 to begin play in the 1976‚Äì77 season. The NHL briefly flirted with relocating the Pittsburgh Penguins to Seattle (and the California Golden Seals to Denver) to address a troubled market and fill the expansion commitment, but ultimately kept the team there. Eventually, the Seattle franchise award was rescinded altogether when the potential ownership group was unable to secure the funds for the expansion fee. In July 1990, the city council approved a deal for a privately-owned $100 million facility to be built on the Ackerley land in SoDo, despite objections over traffic and parking by the Seahawks and Mariners in the neighboring Kingdome. The city's contribution would be to waive about $31 million in tax revenues (about $1 million per year) to potentially be collected on admissions fees at the new arena. It would also pay $2 million for street improvements around the proposed site, including a pedestrian walkway over South Royal Brougham Way. Ackerley also agreed to sign a 30-year lease for the Sonics and to build an 1,800-stall parking garage. Ackerley appeased the Seahawks' concerns, noting the arena would be empty during any NFL games. The Mariners unsuccessfully continued to object, even enlisting then-Major League Baseball commissioner Faye Vincent and then-American League president Bobby Brown to speak before the council ahead of their final vote. During negotiations, Ackerley had asked for a provision to reduce the seating at the Coliseum by 9,000 seats so the older arena couldn't compete with the new building, but the city would not agree. Another selling point of the new arena were luxury suites, a means to attract corporate money and sponsorship that was then an emerging new revenue stream for sports team owners. Ackerley's financing and agreement with the city hinged on the ability to sell the 70 proposed luxury suites. Ackerley also committed to submitting an expansion application to the NHL by a September 15, 1990 deadline as part of the arena deal. His son Bill would head the expansion effort, while a competing group led by Microsoft executive Chris Larson and former Seattle Totems player then coach Bill MacFarland was preparing their own application. With the Ackerley application already submitted, the two groups would merge with Larson and MacFarland being primary points of contact with the NHL. Then owner of the Seattle Thunderbirds, Bill Yuill, also joined the group. Larson and MacFarland, along with Barry Ackerley and Bill Lear, Ackerley's financial advisor, were set to make a presentation to the NHL's Board of Governors on December 5, 1990. At the meeting, Ackerley and Lear asked to meet with the board first, promptly withdrew their application, and left. Larson and MacFarland were stunned to learn of the development but were unable to pursue any recourse as their names were never on the submitted application. Thought to play a factor in Ackerley's decision were the significant demands by the NHL for an expansion team: a $50 million expansion fee that was more than any NHL club was valued at the time; a $5 million down payment that would be forfeited if 10,000 season tickets weren't sold in the first year ‚Äì the Sonics had never sold more than 9,000 season tickets; season tickets needed to produce at least $9 million annually, which would've made the tickets the second most expensive for a team in the area at the time; a 20-year lease with a \\"substantial\\" share of arena revenues from concessions, parking, and ad signage; priority status for postseason arena dates; and a secured $5 million line of credit in case the league had to take over ownership of the team at any point. Ackerley would not sacrifice Sonics revenues for a hockey team in which he would be a minority investor. Seattle would eventually get a NHL team in 2018 when the Seattle Kraken were approved to begin play in 2021. In June 1991, nearly a year after the city agreed to the arena deal, Ackerley announced that the project would not move forward. Increasing project costs, legal disputes, and inability to secure construction financing were cited as reasons to drop the project. Only around 30 of the 70 luxury suites were sold and the Ackerleys were unable to find a corporate buyer for naming rights. Ackerley Communications profits were down, which also contributed to the financing difficulties. A state Supreme Court case brought by Seattle Center employees challenged the constitutionality of the arena deal, while potential lawsuits from the Mariners and trade show organizers and possible legal challenges to environmental review of the project loomed. Seattle Center Arena was extensively remodeled in 1995 for the Sonics. In 2000, Ackerley and his wife Ginger launched the Seattle Storm of the WNBA. Both the SuperSonics and Storm were sold in 2001 to Howard Schultz. =Death= Ackerley died on March 21, 2011, two days after suffering a stroke.Former Seattle SuperSonics owner Barry Ackerley diesFormer Sonics owner Barry Ackerley dies References 1934 births 2011 deaths American media executives American sports businesspeople Seattle SuperSonics owners American philanthropists People from Des Moines, Iowa University of Iowa alumni 20th-century American businesspeople ","title":"Barry Ackerley"},{"id":"31271161","text":"Limnaecia hemidoma is a moth of the family Cosmopterigidae.

Background  Following large scale protests across the country, what would soon become part of the organized opposition in Libya gained control over most of the Nafusa mountains. Gharyan was soon captured by the rebels however as part of the offensive to retake control of Libya from the rebels, Gaddafi quickly dispatched units to regain control. During the night between the 1 and 2 March, loyalist forces came into the town, under the cover of darkness. On the morning of 2 March, the rebels realised that the town was overrun by government troops. Soldiers had a list of opposition members and started to round up all of the rebels in Gharyan. Gharyan had been retaken by the government. Following the defeat of Gaddafi forces in Yafran and Kikla, rebel forces began to make preparations for an attack on Gharyan. On 6 July, Rebels captured Al-Qawalish and advanced on Asabah. However a Gaddafi counterattack was able to hold them back and temporarily recaptured Al- Qawalish. The battle On 13 August, rebel forces attacked Gharyan. It was reported that the rebels were initially successful as Gaddafi forces retreated, however they later regrouped and attacked. On 14 August, the Rebels stated that they controlled \\"70 percent\\" of the city.Al Jazeera Libya Live Blog. August 14, 2011 - 18:38 Entry A fighter in Al-Qawalish said he heard that loyalist troops were retreating from Gharyan. On 15 August, the rebels claimed they had \\"full control\\" of the city. A spokesman for the rebel military council in the Nafusa Mountains asserted, \\"Gharyan is fully in the hands of the revolutionaries. They crushed the Sahban Brigade, the main command center for Gaddafi in the Western Mountains. They took the brigade's heavy and light weapons.\\" On 16 August, governmental spokesman Moussa Ibrahim stated that governmental troops would soon retake Gharyan, implicitly supporting the rebel account that Gharyan had been taken. Reuters confirmed that Gharyan was in rebel hands, with rebel forces positioned in the city centre with a T-34 tank. On 17 August, continued fighting in the city was reported. On 18 August, loyalists fully withdrew from the city, which was confirmed by a Reuters correspondent. The loyalists had retreated north to 'Aziziya.

In the United States, various states have \\"banned Sharia law,\\" or passed some kind of ballot measure that \\"prohibits the state‚Äôs courts from considering foreign, international or religious law.\\" these include Alabama, Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Dakota and Tennessee. In Canada, Sharia law is explicitly banned in Quebec, upheld by a unanimous vote against it in 2005 by the National Assembly,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-gives-thumbs-down-to- shariah-law-1.535601 while the province of Ontario allows family law disputes to be arbitrated only under Ontario law. United States =Constitutional prohibitions and accommodations= Because of the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution, no religious tradition can be established as the basis of laws that apply to everyone, including any form of sharia, Christian canon law, Jewish halakha, or rules of dharma from Eastern religions. Laws must be passed in a secular fashion, not by religious authorities. The Free Exercise Clause allows residents to practice any religion or no religion, and there is often controversy about separation of church and state and the balance between these two clauses when the government does or does not accommodate any particular religious practice (for example blue laws that require stores to be closed on Sunday, the Christian holy day). Direct consultation of any religious law, including any form of sharia, is relatively rare in U.S. jurisprudence and is generally limited to circumstances where the government is accommodating the religious belief of a specific person. This occurs mainly in matters of arbitration and family law. For example, the law may allow parties to submit a dispute for binding arbitration to a mutually agreed-upon religious authority; mandatory arbitration by a specified or mutually-agreed arbitrator is also a common clause in commercial and labor union contracts. Couples with the same religious beliefs may wish to construct marriage contracts and conduct divorces in concordance with those beliefs, and people may also wish to arrange wills and other financial matters in accordance with their own religious principles. If presented as evidence, devotion to peaceful religious principles, along with many other aspects of personality, is commonly considered when judging the character of a person before the law, for example during sentencing or a parole hearing. Despite the Free Exercise Clause, the 1878 Supreme Court decision in Reynolds v. United States (which concerned the conflict of the Mormon practice of polygamy with anti-bigamy laws) affirmed that secular laws still apply when they contradict religious practices, unless a superseding law establishes a right to a religious accommodation. The American Bar Association has opposed legislation banning foreign law or sharia as unnecessary, given that existing safeguards against foreign law already protect against rules that are contrary to American foreign policy, including discrimination on the basis of gender and religion. =Background of controversy= In June 2009, a family court judge in Hudson County, New Jersey denied a restraining order to a woman who testified that her husband, a Muslim, had raped her. The judge said he did not believe the man \\"had a criminal desire to or intent to sexually assault\\" his wife because he was acting in a way that was \\"consistent with his practices.\\" A state appeals court reversed his decision. Advocates of the ban in the U.S. have cited this case as an example of the need for the ban. As of 2014 more than two dozen U.S. states have considered measures intended to restrict judges from consulting sharia law. Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, South Dakota, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Alabama have \\"banned sharia,\\"i.e., passed foreign law bans. In 2010 and 2011 more than two dozen states \\"considered measures to restrict judges from consulting Shariah, or foreign and religious laws more generally\\". As of 2013, all but 16 states have considered such a law. In November 2010, voters in Oklahoma approved a ballot measure to amend the state constitution to ban sharia from state courts. The law was then updated to include all foreign or religious laws.Tanya Somanader Oklahoma‚Äôs New Bill To Block Sharia Law Will Now Ban All Religious Law, Hurt Businesses at ThinkProgress.org blog of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, March 22, 2011 The law was challenged by an official of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

According to him, the purpose of the anti-sharia movement is not to pass legislation banning sharia law in the courts but \\"to get people asking this question, ‚ÄòWhat is Shariah?‚Äô‚Äù. In 2011, Republicans Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich and Michele Bachmann warned about what they saw as the threat of shariah law. During the lead-up to Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign 2012, he described sharia law as a \\"mortal threat\\" and called for its ban throughout America.Newt Gingrich: I'd Support A Muslim Running For President Only If They'd Commit To Give Up Sharia Huffington Post.

Randy Brinson, the president of the Christian Coalition of Alabama, criticized the ban in Alabama, calling it \\"redundant and a waste of time\\". Historian Justin Tyler Clark argues that the rise of an anti-Sharia movement in the US, more than a decade after the September 11 attacks, is in part a reaction to increasing political correctness in the American society. Clark compares the phenomenon to the 19th century anti-Catholic movement in the US, which, he writes, rose largely in reaction to changes in middle-class American etiquette, interpreted by the nativists as encroachment of an alien ideology on their own social norms. According to Sadakat Kadri, the ban on sharia laws notwithstanding, \\"the precepts of Islamic law ... have judicial force in the United States already\\", among Muslims who have had a dispute settled by Muslim conciliators. The 1925 Federal Arbitration Act allows Muslims, Christians, Jews, etc. to use religious tribunals to arbitrate disagreements and \\"the judgments that result are given force of law by state and federal courts\\". The statute \\"preempts inconsistent state legislation\\", such as laws to ban sharia. For American Jews who choose to obey its rulings, a Beth Din (Rabbinical court) \\"may not merely decide the legal rights of devout Jews; in some cases, it may formally forbid believers from pursuing complaints through the secular judicial system without prior authorization from a rabbi. And Muslims can also have their inheritance, business, and matrimonial disputes sorted out by Islamic scholars, who attempt to decide them according to the sharia.\\" While the US Congress could in theory repeal the act, it could not ban arbitration by Muslims while leaving other religious conciliators free to continue their work. \\"Any reform would have to impact equally on all faith communities, and it is not only Muslims who would object if federal legislators presumed to do that.\\" Canada Sharia was explicitly disapproved in Quebec, as expressed by a unanimous motion against it in 2005 by the National Assembly. In Ontario there was a \\"heated 20-month controversy\\" after Toronto lawyer Syed Mumtaz Ali declared in 2004 that an \\"Islamic Institute of Civil Justice\\" would begin \\"arbitrating family matters on the basis of sharia law\\", accompanied by a warning that Muslims who did not submit cases to Islamic arbitration panels were (according to Ali) not \\"good Muslims.\\" In 2005, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty stated, \\"There will be no sharia law in Ontario. There will be no religious arbitration in Ontario. There will be one law for all Ontarians.\\" This referred to McGuinty's plan to rescind the 1991 Arbitration Act, which made arbitration decisions according to religious laws enforceable in Ontario courts. Opposing Ali were \\"anti-tribunal\\" forces of \\"politically savvy women's groups, some of them composed of Muslim women\\", who feared women's equality rights being violated. In 2006, the province of Ontario banned arbitration of family law disputes under any body of laws except Ontario law, in part to prohibit arbitration under religious laws. Western Europe =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, Sharia has also become a political issue. A \\"One law for all\\" campaign seeks to ban sharia councils and arguing this is \\"the only way to end discrimination suffered by Muslim women\\". In 2015, the Conservative Party Home Secretary Theresa May called for an investigation into the application of sharia law in England and Wales if Conservatives win the General Election. A day later the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, told a radio interviewer, he was opposed to \\"a Sharia system running in parallel with UK justice.\\" The issue arose in 2008, when the former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams 'suggested it was \\"inevitable\\" that elements of Sharia would be incorporated in British law.' Since then, \\"Sharia courts\\" have \\"never been far from tabloid headlines\\", according to Myriam Francois-Cerrah. As of 2014, there were reported to be around 85 \\"shariah courts\\" in the UK, Islamic Sharia Council Leyton, East London operated by two rival services ‚Äì Islamic Sharia Council and the newer, smaller, less strict Muslim Arbitration Tribunal. The councils/tribunals provide arbitration that is voluntary but legally binding, are \\"officially mandated\\" and set up outside the court system like another non-secular arbitration institution, the longstanding rabbinical tribunals. The council/tribunals are defended as providing an essential service for pious Muslims who would simply work with non-government mandated Sharia councils if the government abolished the mandated ones. But they are also criticized for taking the man's side in rulings, for example advising women to forfeit their mahr (marriage dower) in exchange for a divorce.bbc.com: \\"Are Sharia councils failing vulnerable women?\\", 6 April 2013 According to legal historian Sadakat Kadri, the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal has \\"no jurisdiction over criminal matters or cases involving children.\\" A UK-trained lawyer sits \\"on all its panels, and every decision\\" is subject to judicial review ‚Äì \\"meaning that it was subject to reversal if it disclosed unfair procedures, human rights violations, or any other step that ordinary court considered contrary to the public interest.\\" According to Kadri, British Muslims neither know nor care about the criminal penalties of Sharia law (tazir and hudud) but seek much less controversial services. In addition to the sharia law of the councils and tribunals, there have also been reports of \\"vigilante sharia squads\\" in some places, such as Whitechapel, East London. The legal system of the United Kingdom treats these squads as criminals. =Germany= Sharia law is part of Germany's private law through the regulations of the German international private law.http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/crossing-borders-with-shariah- the-role-of-islamic-law-in-german-courts-a-722477.html Its application is limited by the order public. In September 2014, a small group of Muslims wearing mock police uniforms patrolled the streets of the western German city of Wuppertal. They \\"reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol\\". Following the incident the Interior Minister Thomas de Maizi√®re told the daily newspaper Bild, \\"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil.\\"https://www.bild.de/politik/inland/salafismus/bundesregierung-alamiert- ueber-wuppertaler-scharia-polizei-37561412.bild.html The leader of the \\"police\\", Salafist Sven Lau, responded by saying the \\"sharia police\\" \\"never existed\\" and he only wanted to \\"raise attention\\" to sharia. The Central Council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. =Greece= The issue of the supremacy of sharia has arisen in Greece where a Muslim woman (Chatitze Molla Sali), was left her husband's estate in his will (a Greek document registered at a notary‚Äôs office) when he died in March 2008. Her in- laws immediately challenged the bequest with the local mufti (a Muslim jurist and theologian) in the name of sharia law, \\"which forbids Muslims to write wills\\" (Islamic law rather than the inheritee determining who gets what from the estate of the deceased). Molla Sali took the dispute to a civil court where she won, but in October 2013, the Greek Supreme Court ruled against her and \\"established that matters of inheritance among the Muslim minority must be resolved by the mufti, following Islamic laws\\", in accordance with the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne between Greece and Turkey. Sali has appealed the decision to the European Court of Human Rights. Muslim-majority countries Although Turkey is a Muslim-majority country, since Kemal Atat√ºrk's reforms and the creation of the Republic of Turkey, Sharia law was banned in 1924 and new westernized civil and penal codes were adopted in 1926.

Background Originally from South Australia, Duigan grew up supporting the Adelaide Crows and playing junior football for Pembroke School in Adelaide and also was a junior player at the Walkerville Football Club. Throughout his junior career, he was troubled by injuries and had a hard time stringing a series of games together until after the age of twenty.

He appeared in a total of 87 senior games for the Redlegs during that time,Morgan, K, The Messenger, \\"Legs pair's dream AFL call-up,\\" 18 November 2010, Retrieved 23 March 2011. and was the club's vice-captain in 2010.Davis, E.

AFL career Duigan left Norwood at the end of 2010, intending to travel to Sudan for a year to do volunteer work. However, he also nominated for the AFL draft, and was drafted by the Carlton Football Club with its fifth selection (#70 overall). The selection surprised many, as it was very rare at the time for a player as old as Duigan (26), and without previous AFL experience, to be drafted. Duigan was given guernsey number 34. Playing in defence, Duigan impressed for the Blues during the pre-season, and he made his senior AFL debut in the club's first round match against Richmond.Windley, M., Herald Sun, \\"Carlton to play three debutants against Richmond in season opener\\", 23 March 2011, Retrieved 23 March 2011. He immediately became a regular in the Carlton backline in the 2011, and was noted for both his ability and his courage. He played twenty-two games for the year and won Carlton's Best First Year Player award. He played sixteen matches in 2012. In 2013, Duigan was elevated to the club's five-man leadership group, however struggled to retain his place in the team on form, playing only three home-and-away matches for the year. He was famously brought into Carlton's elimination final team as an emergency after Brock McLean was injured at the very end of the warm-up, and kicked four goals as Carlton overcame a 32-point deficit to defeat in front of a record crowd of 94,690. Duigan had intended to continue playing in 2014, but after struggling with an ongoing knee injury during the first month of the pre-season, he announced his retirement on 9 December 2013. Post-AFL career In 2014, Duigan moved Geraldton, Western Australia to take a role with mental health services provider Youth Focus. He also took a role as coach, with ambitions to play should his knee heal sufficiently, with the Towns Football Club in the Great Northern Football League.

The term \\"complete\\" is also used without qualification, with differing meanings depending on the context, mostly referring to the property of semantical validity. Intuitively, a system is called complete in this particular sense, if it can derive every formula that is true. Other properties related to completeness The property converse to completeness is called soundness: a system is sound with respect to a property (mostly semantical validity) if each of its theorems has that property.  Forms of completeness  =Expressive completeness= A formal language is expressively complete if it can express the subject matter for which it is intended. =Functional completeness= A set of logical connectives associated with a formal system is functionally complete if it can express all propositional functions. =Semantic completeness= Semantic completeness is the converse of soundness for formal systems. A formal system is complete with respect to tautologousness or \\"semantically complete\\" when all its tautologies are theorems, whereas a formal system is \\"sound\\" when all theorems are tautologies (that is, they are semantically valid formulas: formulas that are true under every interpretation of the language of the system that is consistent with the rules of the system). That is, :: models_{mathcal S} varphi to vdash_{mathcal S} varphi.Hunter, Geoffrey, Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First-Order Logic, University of California Pres, 1971 For example, G√∂del's completeness theorem establishes semantic completeness for first-order logic. =Strong completeness= A formal system is strongly complete or complete in the strong sense if for every set of premises Œì, any formula that semantically follows from Œì is derivable from Œì. That is: :: Gammamodels_{mathcal S} varphi  to Gamma vdash_{mathcal S} varphi. =Refutation completeness= A formal system is refutation-complete if it is able to derive false from every unsatisfiable set of formulas. That is, :: Gamma models_{mathcal S} bot to Gamma vdash_{mathcal S} bot. Here: sect. 2.2.3.1, p.33 Every strongly complete system is also refutation-complete. Intuitively, strong completeness means that, given a formula set Gamma, it is possible to compute every semantical consequence varphi of Gamma, while refutation-completeness means that, given a formula set Gamma and a formula varphi, it is possible to check whether varphi is a semantical consequence of Gamma. Examples of refutation-complete systems include: SLD resolution on Horn clauses, superposition on equational clausal first-order logic, Robinson's resolution on clause sets. Here: sect. 9.7, p.286 The latter is not strongly complete: e.g. { a } models a lor b holds even in the propositional subset of first-order logic, but a lor b cannot be derived from { a } by resolution. However, { a, lnot (a lor b) } vdash bot can be derived. =Syntactical completeness= A formal system is syntactically complete or deductively complete or maximally complete if for each sentence (closed formula) œÜ of the language of the system either œÜ or ¬¨œÜ is a theorem of . This is also called negation completeness, and is stronger than semantic completeness. In another sense, a formal system is syntactically complete if and only if no unprovable sentence can be added to it without introducing an inconsistency. Truth-functional propositional logic and first-order predicate logic are semantically complete, but not syntactically complete (for example, the propositional logic statement consisting of a single propositional variable A is not a theorem, and neither is its negation). G√∂del's incompleteness theorem shows that any recursive system that is sufficiently powerful, such as Peano arithmetic, cannot be both consistent and syntactically complete. =Structural completeness= In superintuitionistic and modal logics, a logic is structurally complete if every admissible rule is derivable.

A knee injury kept him out of the side for the entirety of 1996 but still made headlines when he was charged with affray following a brawl with nightclub security. He did not return until midway through the 1997 season and at the end of the year was again in trouble, this time for urinating on two women at the \\"Saloon Bar\\" in South Yarra.Herald Sun, \\"Footy's dark side\\", 20 March 2004, Trevor Grant Fined for both incidents, Collingwood lost patience with him and he was traded to Richmond. The trade saw Brad Smith and Jamie Tape go to Collingwood, while Richmond received James as well as the draft pick which was used to get Andrew Kellaway. James spent four seasons at Richmond, playing seven games in 1998 and ten more in 1999. He was a regular fixture in the side for the second half of the 2000 AFL season but another knee injury, suffered during the final round match against Carlton, would mean he missed another year of football, in 2001. He nominated for the 2001 AFL draft and was secured by the Western Bulldogs with the 83rd and final pick of the draft. His appearance for the Bulldogs in the opening round of the 2002 season, at Docklands, was to be his last AFL game and he scored a behind with his only possession. Before the end of the season, James left the Bulldogs and finished the year in the Bendigo Football League. He was a member of Gisborne's 2002 premiership team and in 2003 kicked over 100 goals playing at full-forward for the Doutta Stars of the EDFL. In 2004 he played with Lalor in the Diamond Valley Football League and was again prolific as a forward, kicking 114 goals to top the league's charts. He was at Albion in 2005 and kicked over 100 goals for the third successive season of regional football.Bendigo Advertiser, \\"James reaches century\\", 20 July 2009, Luke West. Continuing the pattern of one season club stints, James was with RDFL club the Sunbury Kangaroos in 2006. During the finals series that year he was reported for threatening behavior towards an umpire and suspended for 15 weeks. This kept him out of action for much of 2007 but the following year he played some good football at Stanhope. He kicked 130 goals in the 2009 HDFL season with North Bendigo and had another prolific year up forward in 2010 at Kilmore.

Currently, the school provides business and accounting subjects as well as the introductory of science subjects and computer fundamentals. The first batch graduated in the academic year of 2008‚Äì2009 with 51 students including male and female, and at the moment the school consists of two branches; one is located in Mogadishu, the capital of the state, and the other center in Middle Shabelle Region in central zones of Somalia.

During the Third Reich, she also photographed for eugenicist publications and was commissioned to document the new autobahn and the workers constructing it. Career Born in Wetterburg, now part of Bad Arolsen, Erna Dircksen studied painting at the Kunsthochschule Kassel from 1903 to 1905, and photography at the Lette-Verein from 1910 to 1911.Anne Maxwell, Picture Imperfect: Photography and Eugenics, 1870‚Äì1940, Brighton, Sussex / Portland, Oregon: Sussex Academic Press, 2008, , p. 194.Ute Eskildsen et al., ed., Fotografieren hie√ü Teilnehmen: Fotografinnen der Weimarer Republik, Catalogue of exhibitions at Museum Folkwang Essen, Fundaci√≥ \\"La Caixa\\", Barcelona, Jewish Museum, New York, D√ºsseldorf: Richter, 1994, , n.p.

By 1918 she had a growing reputation, particularly for her nude photography, and was increasingly using a highly realistic style. Already in 1911, she had become interested in portraying the country people of Germany, after accidentally photographing a blacksmith and a farmer while on holiday. In her writings she later expressed a highly romantic view of rural life and contempt for urban life.Carmen B√∂ker, \\"Das vermessene Gesicht\\", Berliner Zeitung 23 July 2005 Sarah Jost, \\"Unter Volksgenossen. Agrarromantik und Gro√üstadtfeindschaft\\", in Menschenbild und Volksgesicht, pp. 105‚Äì20, p. 110 Beginning in 1917, she made a series of photo-portraits of Germans of different regions, a selection of which won first prize at an exhibition in Frankfurt in 1926. On the strength of this she was able to publish some of them in the Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung in 1930.Grimm, p. 42. =Das deutsche Volksgesicht= Lendvai-Dircksen published her portraits of rural Germans as Das deutsche Volksgesicht (The Face of the German Volk) in 1932. It was continued in multiple volumes portraying different regions of the ReichRichard T. Gray, About Face: German Physiognomic Thought from Lavater to Auschwitz, Detroit, Michigan: Wayne State University, 2004, , , p. 396. beginning in 1942, both under that title and as Das germanische Volksgesicht (The Face of the Germanic Volk), now including volumes on, for example, Flanders and Norway. =Autobahn= Under the Third Reich she received state commissions, notably one from Fritz Todt for portraits of autobahn construction workers, originally commissioned for the Schaffendes Volk exhibition of 1937 as part of Todt's effort to have the best photographers in the Reich artistically reproduce the new autobahn.Claudia Gabriele Philipp, \\"'Die sch√∂ne Stra√üe im Bau und unter Verkehr'. Zur Konstituierung des Mythos von der Autobahn durch die mediale Verbreitung und √Ñsthetik der Fotografie\\", in Reichsautobahn: Pyramiden des Dritten Reichs. Analysen zur √Ñsthetik eines unbew√§ltigten Mythos, ed. Reiner Stommer with Claudia Gabriele Philipp, Marburg: Jonas, 1982, , pp. 111‚Äì34, p. 117 Ulrich H√§gele, \\"Erna Lendvai-Dircksen und die Ikonografie der v√∂lkischen Fotografie\\", in Menschenbild und Volksgesicht, pp. 78‚Äì98, p. 78 Todt specifically required her to \\"photographically [depict] the visages of his Reich autobahn workers from the various regions of the Fatherland\\".Cited in Philipp, p. 117 from Lendvai-Dircksen's introduction to the second edition of the book: \\"[Er wollte] das Antlitz seiner Reichsautobahnarbeiter aus den verschiedenen Gegenden des Vaterlandes fotografisch dargestellt sehen\\". The book appeared in 1937 and in a revised edition in 1942. Presumably Todt chose her on the basis of her work in Das deutsche Volksgesicht, and the autobahn book follows a similar plan, following the course of the construction from North Germany south into the Alps, and in each region following illustrations of the landscape and the autobahn, especially the bridges, with depictions of local men working on the project.Philipp, pp. 120‚Äì21. Her pictures of the new bridges emphasise the stonework and the aesthetics of the arches, in some cases using compositional techniques reminiscent of New Objectivity, in others situating the gigantic constructions in nature and in tradition, suggesting their lengthy future existence; in one image, a farmer ploughing with a team of oxen is shown beneath an autobahn bridge.Philipp, pp. 125‚Äì27. Those of the workers, which dominate the book, heroicise them by depicting them individually, in tight close-up and from beneath; she makes use of the \\"cult of the beautiful body\\" as in Leni Riefenstahl's Olympia.Philipp, pp. 121‚Äì22.Maxwell, p. 199. Only occasionally does she pose them looking at the camera, and she rarely shows their tools and then only as illustrations of strength or elements of the composition; she also emphasises hand-work, giving the impression the autobahn was built using very little heavy machinery.Philipp, pp. 122‚Äì24. Captions such as \\"After years of unemployment, I am once again earning honest bread for seven sons and a daughter\\" emphasise the importance of the autobahn as a means of reducing unemployment and ignore the reality of forced labour and the bad conditions in the workers' camps reported by eyewitnesses in favour of the propaganda message.Philipp, pp. 121, 123: \\"Nach Jahren der Arbeitslosigkeit schaffe ich f√ºr sieben S√∂hne und eine Tochter wieder ehrliches Brot\\". =Volk und Rasse= She was also the main photographer of children for the eugenicist periodical Volk und Rasse, posing them in traditional dress and under harsh lighting to clearly capture their desirable racial characteristics.Maxwell, p. 189; Plate 7.10, p. 190. =Later career= In 1943, to escape the bombing of Berlin, she moved to Upper Silesia; in 1945 she lost her archives fleeing from there, and settled in Coburg,Claudia Gabriele Philipp and Horst W. Scholz, Photographische Perspektiven aus den Zwanziger Jahren, Dokumente der Photographie 4, exhibition catalogue, Hamburg: Museum f√ºr Kunst und Gewerbe, 1994, , p. 208 Frauenobjektiv: Fotografinnen 1940 bis 1950, ed. Petra Rosgen, exhibition catalogue, Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Cologne: Wienand, 2001, , pp. 51‚Äì52. where from the 1950s she began to concentrate on landscape photography in colour. Her postwar work is housed in the Agfa Foto- Historama in Cologne. =Exhibitions and honours= In addition to the Frankfurt show in 1926 at which she won first prize, Lendvai-Dircksen's portraits were exhibited at the Pressa in Cologne in 1928, and a touring exhibition of the series visited various German cities beginning in autumn 1933. The same year, she was accorded a special exhibition in Erfurt by the Gesellschaft Deutscher Lichtbildner (Society of German Photographers, predecessor of the Deutsche Fotografische Akademie). After the war she exhibited in Coburg and Stuttgart in 1953 and in Cologne in 1958, and landscapes by her were featured at the Cologne Photo-kina in 1960.Claudia Gabriele Philipp, \\"Erna Lendvai-Dircksen (1883‚Äì1962): Pr√§sentantin einer weiblichen Kunsttradition oder Propagandistin des Nationalsozialismus?\\", in Frauen und Macht: der allt√§gliche Beitrag der Frauen zur Politik des Patriarchats, ed.

Wolf Strache and Otto Steinert, Stuttgart: Dr. Wolf Strache, 1968, , p. 151 Critical reception Lendvai-Dircksen's portraits of farmers suited the Nazi ethos except that in her initial publication, almost all her subjects were old, and indeed she clearly portrayed the damage to their bodies as a sign of authenticity.Maxwell, p. 195. She later widened her focus to include children. She never, however, photographed sport, whether for technical reasons or because of her personal philosophy.Maxwell, p. 200. Although Lendvai-Dircksen has been referred to as \\"brown Erna\\" for the promotion of Nazi ideals in her work under the Third Reich, her portrait photography can be compared to the work of Dorothea Lange or Walker Evans as documentation of impoverished people, and Margaret Bourke-White also photographed labourers in a heroic light. As pointed out by Berlin photographic curator Janos Frecot in the catalogue of an exhibition at the Albertina which included her work, her portraits and those of others at the time can be seen as applications of the same ethnographic principle as portraits of people in faraway cultures; similarly, Leesa Rittelmann has shown that the same principle of characterising a country by the physiognomies of its people, although a throwback to 19th-century theories,Or even earlier; Gray, p. 354 judges her views about the \\"authenticity\\" of rural people as expressed in their faces to be \\"identical in many ways\\" to those of Johann Kaspar Lavater in the second half of the 17th century. was shared by Weimar-era photographers such as the progressive August Sander, in his Antlitz der Zeit (Face of Our Time).Leesa Rittelmann, \\"Facing Off: Photography, Physiognomy, and National Identity in the Modern German Photobook\\", Radical History Review 106 (2010) 137‚Äì61 (abstract) Private life Dircksen was married from 1906 to 1910 to Adolf G√∂schel, with whom she had a daughter, and from 1913 to 1924 to the Hungarian composer Erwin Lendvai.Eskildsen et al., n.p.

Do√±a Patricia raised ten children, some of whom helped change the course of history. At age 49, she uprooted her life in 1824 to help her husband Mart√≠n De Le√≥n establish the predominantly Mexican De Le√≥n's Colony. She contributed her inherited assets to the founding of the colony, and helped establish a school and a church. From the onset, she worked to instill a sense of Mexican and Spanish culture in the colony. After the death of her husband, Do√±a Patricia assumed the role of head of the family. Recorded Texas Historic Landmark number 6539 placed at Evergreen Cemetery in 1972 acknowledges Patricia de la Garza De Le√≥n's contribution to Texas. Recorded Texas Historic Landmark number 6543 placed at Church and Bridge Streets in 1936 denotes the home of Patricia de la Garza De Le√≥n and Don Martin De Le√≥n's home in Victoria. Early life Do√±a Patricia de la Garza De Le√≥n was born in 1775 in Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas, Mexico, to a wealthy family headed by her father Felipe de la Garza. Marriage and children In 1795, she married Mart√≠n De Le√≥n and settled with him at his ranch in Cruillas. Mart√≠n sold wild mustangs, mules and cattle in New Orleans. The couple's first child Fernando was born at the Cruillas ranch in 1798. The couple moved their base of ranching operations in 1799 to San Patricio County, Texas, where three more children were born. Daughter Candelaria was born in 1800, son Silvestre in 1802, and daughter Guadalupe in 1804. The Spanish government granted the family land on the east bank of the Aransas River, north of Corpus Christi in 1805. Son F√©lix was born there in 1806 and son Agapito in 1808. While at this location in 1807, Mart√≠n De Le√≥n registered the family's cattle brand, the first registered brand in what would become Texas. The family moved to south of the Nueces River in 1810, where daughter Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s (Mar√≠a) was born that year. Indian depredations increased as the Spanish government withdrew troops. The family moved northward to just outside San Antonio where three daughters were born. Mar√≠a del Refugio (Refugio) arrived in 1812, Agustina in 1814 and Francisca in 1818. Establishing Victoria, Texas On April 13, 1824, the provisional Mexican government granted Mart√≠n De Le√≥n an empresario contract to settle forty-one Mexican families on the lower Guadalupe and Lavaca rivers. At age 49, with her four adult children and six minor children, Patricia de la Garza De Le√≥n uprooted her life to become her husband's partner in the founding of De Le√≥n's Colony. She gave her inheritance of $9,800, plus another $300 valuation of cows, horses, and mules, in order to help get the colonization off the ground. At Victoria, Do√±a Patricia transplanted cultural traditions of Mexico and Spain to the community. The De Le√≥n family lived in a log home with a dirt floor. Nevertheless, Do√±a Patricia filled it with imported furniture provided to her from her family in Mexico. The family kept domestic servants, and the home became a community gathering place. She discouraged her children from using guns, for fear they would be perceived as bandits. She sent her children and grandchildren to school in Mexico and Spain. When Jos√© Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Carbajal platted the town, she made sure land was set aside for a school and a church. Her donation of $500 in gold helped to build and furnish the church. Death of Martin De Le√≥n Mart√≠n De Le√≥n died of cholera in 1833, and left an estate worth $500,000. Fernando took over the colony responsibilities of his father. Do√±a Patricia managed the family assets and continued her civic work. Exile The De Le√≥n extended family, like many Mexicans, were opposed to the regime of Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna. Texas independence was a separate issue. As the issue did with other Mexicans living in Texas, it divided the De Le√≥n extended family, some of whom helped change the course of history in both Texas and Mexico. Divided loyalties among the Mexicans made them subject to suspicion and prejudice from the new Republic of Texas government and military establishment.Chance (2006) p.42 Candelaria's husband Jos√© Miguel Aldrete was 1835 state land commissioner of Coahuila y Tejas. Aldrete joined several Texas insurgent groups to resist Santa Anna. Refugia married Jos√© Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Carbajal in 1832. Initially, he teamed up with Fernando De Le√≥n and Peter Kerr, to trade livestock for munitions to help his old friend and mentor Stephen F. Austin. Carbajal, however, felt his loyalties lay with the Mexican people, not the Texas cause. He moved across the Rio Grande and waged guerilla warfare in Mexico against Santa Anna's political machine. Do√±a Patricia loaned Carbajal $6,000 for his cause.Chance (2006) p.154 Fernando later became aide- de-camp to provisional Texas governor James W. Robinson. Maria had one daughter with her husband Mexican politician and military officer Rafael Manchola. He died of cholera in 1832 or 1833. Augustina married Pl√°cido Benavides, who opposed Santa Anna's dictatorship, but felt Texas should remain part of Mexico. Benavides led a unit of Tejano fighters at the Battle of Goliad. He was recruited by Stephen F. Austin for the 1835 Siege of B√©xar to drive Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos out of Texas. Silvestre fought beside his brother-in-law Pl√°cido at the Siege of B√©xar. Benavides earned himself the sobriquet of the \\"Texas Paul Revere\\" for his 1836 journey from San Patricio to Goliad to Victoria, warning residents of the approaching Mexican army. Do√±a Patricia's youngest son Agapito was murdered in 1836. In 1972, Recorded Texas Historic Landmark number 6538 was designated in recognition of Agapito De Le√≥n. On July 20, 1836, Brigadier General Thomas Jefferson Rusk ordered Mexican families in the Victoria area to be evacuated in an attempt to stem any assistance being given to Santa Anna. The Carbajal, Benavides and De Le√≥n families left for New Orleans, forced to abandon their money and possessions.Chance (2006) p.43 In Louisiana, they lived in poverty, and then moved back with Do√±a Patricia's family in Soto la Marina. She was able to sell 25,000 acres of land near Garcitias Creek for $10,000 in 1837. Silvestre De Le√≥n returned to Victoria in 1842 to try and reclaim the family's property, and was murdered by persons unknown. Do√±a Patricia returned to Texas in 1844, only to find her assets had been redistributed among new settlers. In the new climate, she had lost her social standing in the community. She devoted the rest of her life in service to the local Catholic church.  Death  Do√±a Patricia died in 1849, and is buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Victoria, Texas. Before her death, she had donated the original De Le√≥n homestead to the Catholic Church. She also donated altar vessels and a gold monstrance. Saint Mary's Catholic Church occupies the site of the De Le√≥n homestead.

The film was sponsored by the owners of The Times, and depicts the preparation and production of a day's edition of the newspaper. The film is notable for the fact that it went unreleased (apart from a small number of private screenings for the sponsor and critics). The Second World War broke out while it was in production, and the explanation for The Fourth Estate having been buried most commonly given by historians of the Documentary Movement is that following the film's completion, the Ministry of Information were reluctant to sanction its release on the grounds that it depicted life in peacetime London, which would no longer be accepted by viewers as realistic. However, Rotha himself claimed that the film's sponsor was reluctant to release The Fourth Estate in the belief that it implicitly criticised The Times from a leftist perspective, portraying it as the mouthpiece of the establishment. Another point of interest is that Carl Mayer, the Jewish and prominent Weimar screenwriter, who by this time was living in Britain as an exile from the Nazis, acted as a 'scenario consultant' to the film.

James has lived in Kansas City's Union Hill neighborhood. As mayor, he was known for wearing bow ties.  Early life, education, and career  James grew up on the East side of Kansas City, at 44th Street and Montgall Avenue. He graduated from Bishop Hogan High School in 1969. There, he was the lead singer of the Amelia Earhart Memorial Flying Band (later renamed Manchester Trafficway) from 1965 to 1970. The band was the opening act for Jefferson Airplane when it performed in Kansas City. In 1971 James joined the Marines and served as a military policeman in California, Japan, and the Philippines; he was honorably discharged in 1975. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Rockhurst College in 1980, graduating cum laude. In college, he joined the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Thereafter, he attended law school at the Syracuse University College of Law from 1980 to 1981, but then transferred to the University of Minnesota Law School, where he received a juris doctor degree in 1983, again graduating cum laude. After law school, James returned to Kansas City and joined the law firm of Blackwell Sanders Matheny Weary & Lombardi as an associate; in 1990, he became the firm's first African-American partner. In 1993, he and Nancy Kenner left to form their own firm, Kenner & James, P.C., specializing in personal injury, medical malpractice, and nursing home negligence. In 2002 he left to start the Sly James Firm, where he continued to specialize in personal injury and other civil litigation, as well as mediation. Between 1992 and 2002, he served as a member, secretary, and later the president of the Missouri Board of Law of Examiners. In 2003 he served as president of the Kansas City Metropolitan Bar Association. In 2012 Newsweek / The Daily Beast included James in its list of most innovative mayors for his work in turning Kansas City into the \\"Silicon Prairie,\\" spurring its entrepreneurial development and for partnering with Google to bring their ultra-high speed broadband network to the city.  2011 mayoral election  In 2010, despite having held no previous public elected office, James announced his candidacy for mayor of Kansas City in the city's 2011 non-partisan election. In February 2011, he finished first in the primary with 27 percent of the vote; Kansas City attorney and Platte County resident Mike Burke finished second with 26 percent, and incumbent mayor Mark Funkhouser finished third, with 21 percent. The race for the general runoff election on March 22, 2011, between James and Burke was described as low-key and cordial. Whereas James had been endorsed by the Kansas City Star, Burke had been endorsed by former mayors Charlie Wheeler, Richard L. Berkley, and Kay Barnes. Ultimately, with only 21 percent of the City's registered voters voting, James defeated Burke by 54 percent to 46 percent. James celebrated his victory at the American Jazz Museum in Kansas City's 18th and Vine District. James became the second African-American mayor in Kansas City's history after Emanuel Cleaver. https://www.kceb.org/useruploads/Past_Election_Results/3_22_11_GEMS_ELECTION_RESULTS.pdf 2011 Plaza shooting incident On August 13, 2011, James and entourage were touring the Country Club Plaza to investigate a request from Highwoods Properties (which manages the buildings in the Plaza) about imposing a 9 p.m. curfew on the Plaza because of unruly teens gathering there at night. During the tour about 11:30 p.m. gunfire broke out near 47th Street and Wyandotte Avenue, about 50 yards from the mayor.

He won with 87.3% of the vote.  2016 White House visit  On January 21, 2016 James made an appearance during the White House daily briefing. Josh Earnest, the White House Press Secretary at the time, is a native of Kansas City. Although he is a non-partisan mayor, during his speaking time, James said that \\"Kansas City has done quite well under this administration\\". James also complimented Barack Obama's role in preserving race relations within Kansas City. Kansas City's role in startups, such as Google Fiber, was boasted, along with the 2015 World Series victory of the Kansas City Royals.  2018 bleaching of homeless meals  On November 4, 2018, Kansas City health officials seized chili, sandwiches, and soup being distributed to homeless people by the community organization Free Hot Soup. The meals were later soaked in bleach to prevent the homeless from consuming them. James defended the practice, arguing that the city had been unable to determine whether the meals were safe to eat.

Co-starring in the film are Jimmy Clanton, Sandy Stewart, and Chuck Berry. The film has also been released as Johnny Melody, The Swinging Story and The Swinging Story of Johnny Melody. Plot summary Chuck Berry performs \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" over the opening titles. We meet a young singer (Jimmy Clanton) who goes by the stage name of Johnny Melody. After a few opening performances, Berry and Alan Freed (playing themselves) discuss their discovery of Johnny, whose fate once hinged on the toss of a coin, with Freed intimating that Johnny nearly ended in jail. Berry demands to know the rest of the story. Alan relates that Johnny was once a choir boy from an orphanage. After a practice, the choir director expresses his contempt for rock and roll and leaves. A moment later, he returns to find the kids performing \\"Ship On A Stormy Sea\\" with Johnny, who has no last name, in the lead. He stops the song and says that he'll call the other kids' parents, but since Johnny has no parents, he is dismissed and will be sent back to the orphanage. Instead, he gets a job as an usher in a theater, but is fired on his first day for dancing in the aisle to Jo Ann Campbell's \\"Mama Can I Go Out\\". During the performance, Alan freed announces a talent search for a singer to be re-named \\"Johnny Melody\\". At the theater door, Johnny meets his old friend from the orphanage, Julie Arnold (Sandy Stewart). She wants him to call her to re-connect, but he tells her he has no money for dates and is saving to record a demo record. Freed then tells Johnny that the talent search was only a publicity stunt by his agent. At a recording studio, Julie records a demo of \\"Playmates\\". On her way out, she meets Johnny again, and sings back- up on his recording of \\"My Love Is Strong\\". The record is one of many sent to Freed, but Berry, hearing something special in it, urges that it be given strong consideration. But Johnny has failed to include contact information, and his subsequent call to Freed's office fails to get through. Johnny and Julie begin to fall in love, and he wants to get her a special pin for Christmas. After pawning his trumpet, he still doesn't have enough, and he determines to break the jewelry store window with a brick. In the meantime, Freed has begun playing Johnny's record on his radio show to overwhelming response, and has started a public search for Johnny. After hearing the show, Julie rouses Freed and they trail Johnny to the area of the jewelry store, at one point flipping a coin to decide in which direction to look. They find Johnny just as he throws the brick. Freed sends Johnny away with Julie and diverts the police by pretending to be a drunk who tossed the brick. This brings us back to present, and Johnny and Julie are married.

During its take-off run, Piper PA-23 Aztec G-AYDE of McAlpine Aviation entered the active runway without permission. Although the pilots of the One-Eleven tried to take avoiding action, a collision between the two aircraft occurred, killing the pilot of the Aztec and injuring his passenger. The pilots of the substantially damaged One-Eleven successfully aborted the take-off and the aircraft was evacuated using emergency slides, with no casualties. The Aztec was written off, but the One-Eleven was repaired and returned to service. Four recommendations were made following the accident. Accident Flight 95 was an international charter flight from Luton, Bedfordshire, UK, to Munich-Riem, West Germany. At 15:19 Greenwich Mean Time, the One-Eleven received permission to taxi to holding point Delta where it was to await clearance. At 15:24 GMT, permission was granted for the One-Eleven to enter runway 08/26 and backtrack along Runway 08, where the aircraft was to hold at the threshold awaiting permission to take off. The One-Eleven reported it was entering Runway 08/26 between 15:25:14 and 15:25:23. At 15:25:32, the Aztec reported that it was ready to taxi. Information was given to the pilot of the Aztec that the wind was from 300¬∞ at and the pilot was offered a choice of runway 08 or runway 26 for take-off. He chose runway 26. At about 15:26, the Aztec was instructed \\"Cleared to Alpha Two Six\\", This was non-standard phraseology; the correct instruction should have been \\"Cleared to holding point Alpha, Runway Two Six\\". This non-standard phraseology was a causal factor in the accident. In the meantime, the One-Eleven had received clearance to take off at 15:25:24 and reported that it was rolling at 15:27:31. At 15:27:49, the Aztec was asked to report when it was ready for take-off, to which the reply was that it would be ready in 30 seconds. The Aztec then entered the active runway. The passenger on board the Aztec, who was also a pilot himself, queried the pilot via the intercom as to whether or not the aircraft had been cleared to enter the runway. He did not receive an answer, and by this time the aircraft had entered the runway. At this point, the One-Eleven had reached a speed of during its take-off run. The first officer was flying the aircraft. The captain, seeing the Aztec enter the runway from the left and realising it was not going to stop, took control of the aircraft. He fully opened both throttles and steered the aircraft to the right whilst attempting to lift the port wing over the Aztec. The passenger in the Aztec saw the One-Eleven approaching and ducked before the collision occurred, but was unable to warn the pilot of the impending collision. The port wing of the One-Eleven sliced through the cabin of the Aztec, killing the pilot instantly and injuring the passenger. The Aztec lost the top of the cabin and its propellers were damaged, while the outer of the One-Eleven's port wing was substantially damaged, resulting in fuel leaking from the tank contained therein. Use of full reverse thrust and maximum braking enabled the take-off to be successfully aborted within the remaining runway length, with the damaged One- Eleven stopping beyond the point of collision. As there was a risk of fire from the leaking fuel, the commander ordered an emergency evacuation of the aircraft. Although the rear doors opened as intended and the evacuation slides deployed, both forward doors required considerable force to open them before all on board could evacuate the aircraft. No injuries were sustained in the evacuation. The investigation subsequently was able to replicate the difficulty in opening both forward doors on the One-Eleven. It was discovered that inadequate guidance from the manufacturer of the escape slides meant that they were incorrectly stowed. One door had an incorrect part fitted. A warning was issued to all One-Eleven operators and the relevant aviation authorities concerning this issue. After the accident, some airline pilots called for general aviation aircraft to be banned from using Luton, a view which was not supported by the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators Aircraft =BAC One-Eleven= The BAC One-Eleven 518 involved was registered G-AXMJ, c/n H204, and was built in February 1970. Following the accident, the aircraft was repaired and returned to service. In February 1975, it was re-registered G-BCWG before entering service with Monarch Airlines.the aircraft was re- registered to avoid its being impounded at overseas airports in lieu of user charges owed by the then bankrupt Court Line The aircraft was subsequently sold on to Philippine Airlines, which had it re-registered RP-C1189. =Piper Aztec= The Piper PA-23 Aztec involved was registered G-AYDE, c/n 27-3807. Manufactured in 1967, it had previously been registered N6516Y in the United States, before being sold to McAlpine Aviation in 1970. Investigation The accident was investigated by the Accidents Investigation Branch. The final report was issued on 26 February 1975. The cause of the accident was found to be that the pilot of the Aztec entered the active runway without permission. Non-standard phraseology by the controller at Luton was found to be a contributory factor. The ground markings and signage at Luton were found to be compliant with the legislation then existing. No stop bars or stop lights were provided, nor were they required by law. The pilots were not informed by radio of each other's movements, so may have been unaware that the runway was being used for departures in both directions. Although the radio installation on the Aztec conformed to legislation then existing, its arrangement was criticised as the passenger/co-pilot could not hear in his headset transmissions made by the pilot. Four recommendations were made; three concerning the operation of Luton Airport and one concerning the radio installation in aircraft.

His roles in the midfield and as a utility began to diversify in late 2015 after Malthouse's departure from the club; and after being elevated to the club's leadership group, he had a break-out year as a two-way tagger in 2016, increasing his attacking output as well as continuing to be a dependable tagger. Personal life Curnow's younger brother Charlie is also a footballer at the Carlton Football Club, being drafted to the club in 2016.

It is the subject of an essay by Dan North in Sights Unseen: Unfinished British Films, edited by him, and is referenced by Stephen Fry, employed as a script rewriter for the film, in his book The Fry Chronicles: An Autobiography. About a quarter of the script was shot and it is extensively archived at the Bill Douglas Centre for the History of Cinema and Popular Culture at the University of Exeter. Plot Stephen Fry characterises the film as The film tells the story of a gossip-columnist Clare who enjoys a privileged life on the fringes of high society. However she gets into trouble over an indiscreet story she writes and falls from favour. She is rescued by William, a Cambridge don. Cast Clare was to be played by Anne Louise Lambert and William by Anthony Higgins, who had already starred opposite Lambert in The Draughtsman's Contract. Simon Callow and Gary Oldman were also cast. It was to be Oldman's screen debut though none of his scenes were shot. Script The script went through several incarnations. It began as a 1979 treatment by Frances Lynn entitled Frantic: A Story About a Gossip Columnist whose characters included a certain Romo Dolonski, a Polish film director out on bail for abducting a 12-year-old girl. This sharp and bitchy treatment formed the basis for subsequent scripts. By then Boyd was working in America and engaged the Tolkin brothers, Michael Tolkin and Stephen Tolkin, to take the treatment over and provide a US-based script for Universal Studios. However Universal Studios found the script too 'arty and European' and pulled out, which left Boyd free to take the project elsewhere. By this time he had returned to the UK and decided to reset the script in London as it had begun, eventually hiring Fry to do the rewrite. Finance At the Cannes Film Festival in May 1982, Boyd was introduced to Alan Shephard representing the Martini Foundation. This foundation, based in Liechtenstein and led by Raymond Lanciault, had allegedly sold up their vermouth interests and wanted to diversify into films. Boyd struck a deal with the foundation in which the foundation would finance four of his films at $5 million each for a $600,000 introduction fee and a 50% share in the profits. The initial $5 million for Gossip was to be provided in the form of certificates of deposit at a mutually agreed Dutch bank. The agreement was signed 6 July 1982, the day after Boyd received the final script from Fry. Production A huge Andrew McAlpine designed night-club set was constructed at Twickenham Studios, financed by a third-party ¬£100,000 loan while Boyd awaited the Martini money, and shooting began on 25 October 1982. In the event the Martini money never arrived and the production was shut down on 14 November 1982. Aftermath Most production members did not get paid, although the Tolkin brothers and Stephen Fry had been. At September 1983 liabilities stood at ¬£1,162,000 and Boyd was effectively blackballed by the unions until these were cleared. Boyd did not make another film for three years as a result. Boyd's production company, Boyd's Co, went into receivership in 1991.

Its purpose was to return two hybrid battleship-aircraft carriers and four escort ships to Japan from Singapore, where they had been based since November the previous year. The movement of the Japanese force was detected by the Allies, but all attempts to attack it with submarines and aircraft failed. Nevertheless, as a result of the intensifying Allied blockade of Japan, the Ise-class battleship-carriers and their escorts were among the last IJN warships to safely reach the country from the Southwest Pacific before the end of the war. Before departing Singapore, the Japanese ships, which were designated the Completion Force, were loaded with supplies of oil and other important raw materials. This formed part of an effort to run increased quantities of supplies through the Allied blockade of Japan before the country was cut off from its empire. The Allies had learned of the Completion Force's composition and goals through intelligence gained from decrypting Japanese radio signals, and plans were developed for coordinated attacks on it by submarines and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) aircraft. As part of these preparations, 26 submarines were eventually positioned along the ships' expected route. The Completion Force sailed on 10 February 1945 and was sighted leaving port by a Royal Navy submarine. However, attempts by it and several United States Navy submarines to attack between 11 and 14 February were unsuccessful. More than 88 USAAF aircraft attempted to bomb the Completion Force on 13 and 14 February, but were unable to do so because of bad weather. A further submarine attack on 16 February did not damage any of the Japanese ships. As a result, the Completion Force reached its destination of Kure in Japan on 20 February without having suffered any casualties. Despite this success, the Japanese Government was forced to discontinue its efforts to ship oil from Southeast Asia to Japan in March due to the heavy losses Allied submarines were inflicting on oil tankers, and all the ships of the Completion Force were sunk in or near Japanese home waters before the end of the war.  Background  During 1944, Allied submarine attacks effectively cut off the supply of oil from Southeast Asia to Japan and greatly reduced Japanese imports of other commodities. By this stage of the war, the oil reserves in Japan had been largely depleted. U.S. Navy submarines sank many Japanese warships during 1944, including the battleship , seven aircraft carriers, two heavy and seven light cruisers.Blair (2001), pp. 816‚Äì817 In early 1945, the Japanese Government assessed that all convoy routes from the south would eventually be cut, and attempted to supplement the supplies of oil brought in by tankers by loading drums of oil on freighters. Several IJN aircraft carriers were also used to transport drums of oil from Singapore to Japan.Prados (1995), p. 703 On 11 November 1944, the two Ise- class hybrid battleship-aircraft carriers‚Äî and , which were grouped as Carrier Division 4 and under the command of Rear Admiral Matsuda Chiaki‚Äîsailed from the Japanese home islands to join the main body of the IJN in the Southwest Pacific.Whitley (1998), p. 199Hackett et al. (2011) This deployment was made to both reinforce the remaining elements of the IJN in the area and place the ships near a source of fuel.Willmott (2002), p. 200 During their voyage from Japan, each of the battleship-carriers was loaded with about of munitions for the units defending Manila in the Philippines. Due to heavy Allied air attacks on Manila, the two warships unloaded their supplies in the Spratly Islands from 14 November. They sailed for Lingga Roads near Singapore on the 20th of the month and arrived there two days later. The Allies learned from intelligence gained by decrypting Japanese radio signals that the battleship- carriers had sailed. Allied submarines were ordered to keep watch for the ships, but did not intercept Ise or Hy≈´ga during their voyage to Singapore.Prados (1995), p. 701 The two battleship-carriers were deployed to Cam Ranh Bay in Indochina during December and returned to Singapore on 11 January 1945. The U.S. Third Fleet raided the South China Sea between 10 and 20 January in search of the Japanese fleet, but did not locate Ise or Hy≈´ga.  Preparations  In early February 1945, Ise, Hy≈´ga and an escort of smaller warships received orders to sail to Japan in what was designated Operation Kita. The goal of this operation was to return some of the IJN warships in the Southwest Pacific to Japan loaded with important supplies.Lacroix and Wells (1997), p. 650 The ships selected to accompany the battleship-carriers were the light cruiser (which became part of Carrier Division 4 from 10 February) and destroyers , and .Lacroix and Wells (1997), pp. 650‚Äì651 Carrier Division 4 and its escorts was designated the Completion Force (ÂÆåÈÉ®Èöä Kan-butai). The ships of the Completion Force departed the Lingga Roads on 6 February and began loading their cargoes in Singapore the next day. Shortly before docking, Ise sustained a small amount of damage when she struck a mine which had been dropped by Allied aircraft. During the Completion Force's period at Singapore all six ships were loaded with supplies and Ise received temporary repairs. Hy≈´ga embarked 4,944 drums of aviation gasoline as well as 326 drums of standard gasoline and 440 oil field workers. Ise was loaded with 5,200 drums of aviation gasoline and 551 oil workers; each of the battleship-carriers also embarked of rubber, 1,750 short tons of tin and of other metals.Lacroix and Wells (1997), p. 651 ≈åyodo was loaded with of tin, of tungsten, 70 tons of aviation gasoline, of rubber, of zinc and of mercury. A further of rubber and tin was split among the three destroyers. Through code breaking, Allied intelligence was aware of the Completion Force's composition and objectives. Allied signals intelligence units carefully monitored radio transmissions in the Singapore region, and the resulting \\"Ultra\\" intelligence provided details of the two battleship-carriers' movements to Singapore, preparations to return to Japan and planned route.Blair (2001), p. 846Holmes (1979), p. 201 The commander of Allied submarines in the South-West Pacific Area (Task Force 71), Rear Admiral James Fife, Jr., placed a high priority on stopping Ise and Hy≈´ga from reaching Japan, and stationed 15 submarines along their expected route.Blair (2001), pp. 846‚Äì847 A plan for coordinated attacks on the ships by the U.S. Navy and USAAF was developed.Craven and Cate (1953), p. 492 At the time, the U.S. Seventh Fleet was assigned four battleships in Filipino waters to guard the Allied beachhead at Lingayen Gulf in Luzon against attacks by the Japanese forces based at Lingga Roads and the Inland Sea until the USAAF forces in the region were strong enough to assume this responsibility.Morison (1959), pp. 176‚Äì178 As of early February, the USAAF units in the Philippines were focused on supporting the United States Army‚Äìled Philippines Campaign and attacking Japanese facilities in Formosa. An intensive campaign against Japanese shipping in the South China Sea had been planned, but was yet to begin.Craven and Cate (1953), pp. 470, 491‚Äì492 Voyage The Completion Force's approximate route between Singapore and JapanBlair (2001), pp. 826, 848 The Completion Force sailed from Singapore on the evening of 10 February. The timing of its departure was set by a long-term forecast of bad weather for the voyage to Japan. The British submarine observed the ships leaving port and attempted to attack them on 11 February, but was driven off by a Japanese aircraft. Following this action, Tantalus radioed a contact report to Fife's headquarters.Blair (2001), p. 847 The four U.S. Navy battleships at Lingayen Gulf sailed on 10 February bound for U.S. bases in the Pacific where they were to receive repairs and undertake preparations ahead of their role supporting the invasion of Okinawa. The ships left the Philippines area on 14 February without having played any part in efforts to intercept the Completion Force.Morison (1959), p. 178 U.S. Navy submarines unsuccessfully attempted to attack the Japanese ships on 12 February. At about 1:45 p.m., detected the Completion Force at a distance of using her radar and transmitted a contact report. An hour later, made radar contact with the Japanese ships at a range of . Over the next 14 hours the submarines Blackfin, Charr, , and attempted to reach a position where they could attack the Japanese ships, but were unable to do so. A group of submarines to the north‚Äîcomprising , and ‚Äîwas unable to reach a position where they could attack the Completion Force. USAAF patrols made contact with the Completion Force on 12 February; following this, it was tracked almost continuously by radar-equipped Army Air Forces and U.S. Navy aircraft. On the morning of 13 February, a force of B-24 Liberator heavy bombers and 40 B-25 Mitchell medium bombers escorted by 48 P-51 Mustang fighters was dispatched from several bases on the islands of Leyte and Mindoro to attack the Japanese ships. While the aircraft successfully rendezvoused near the Completion Force, heavy cloud cover kept them from spotting any of the ships. As radar-directed blind bombing was prohibited to avoid accidental attacks on the Allied submarines in the area, the strike force returned to its bases without attacking.Craven and Cate (1953), pp. 492‚Äì494 On the same day, the Australian destroyers and departed Lingayen Gulf and proceeded to a position about west of Manila where they were held in readiness to rescue the crews of any aircraft downed while attacking the Completion Force.Gill (1968), p. 599 More submarines attempted to attack the Japanese force on 13 February. A group of three boats‚Äîcomprising , and ‚Äîwas deployed along its route, and Bergall sighted the Japanese ships at 12:30 p.m. The submarine was submerged at the time and attempted to maneuver into a firing position, but could not get any closer to the ships than . Nevertheless, it fired six torpedoes at the Japanese force, all of which missed. Blower attempted a submerged attack, firing five torpedoes at one of the battleship-carriers and ≈åyodo; all missed. and , the northernmost submarines that Rear Admiral Fife had deployed, encountered the Completion Force during the afternoon of 13 February. Bashaw sighted the Japanese ships as they emerged from a rain squall at 3:15 p.m., but one of the battleship-carriers spotted the submarine and launched an aircraft to attack it. Bashaw was forced to dive when the battleship-carrier began shelling it with her main battery, and neither it nor Flasher was able to intercept the Completion Force. During this period the other submarines in the area continued to chase the Japanese ships but did not regain contact with them.Blair (2001), pp. 847‚Äì849 An air attack was attempted against the Completion Force on 14 February. The number of B-24s, B-25s and escorting P-51s dispatched on this day was smaller than the force which had been used on 13 February, as the Japanese ships were now beyond the range of aircraft based at Leyte. Once again, cloud cover over the Completion Force prevented the Allied aircraft from sighting the Japanese ships, and they were unable to attack due to the prohibition on radar-aimed bombing. This was the USAAF's last attempt to bomb the Japanese force. As a result, the only successes gained by the USAAF aircraft involved in the operation were to shoot down a Mitsubishi Ki-57 \\"Topsy\\" transport plane near the Completion Force on 13 February as well as several fighters in the area of the ships between the 12th and 14th of the month.Craven and Cate (1953), p. 494 The two Australian destroyers were released for other duties on 15 February. Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood‚Äîthe commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's submarine force‚Äîfollowed the unsuccessful attempts to intercept the Completion Force in the South China Sea, and stationed a further eleven submarines along its projected route between the Luzon Strait and Japan.Blair (2001), p. 849 The Completion Force reached the Matsu Islands at the northern end of the Formosa Strait in the evening of 15 February, and anchored there for five hours. The Japanese ships resumed their journey to Kure via Korea and the Shimonoseki Strait at midnight, and the destroyers and were attached to the force for part of the day.Lacroix and Wells (1997), p. 652 At 5:07 am on 16 February, intercepted the Completion Force south of the Chinese city of Wenchow and fired six torpedoes at one of the escorts, but all missed. At this time the Japanese ships were sailing at a speed of . None of the other American submarines made contact with the Japanese force as it sailed to the east of where they had been positioned by Lockwood. The Completion Force finished its entire voyage in about 10 days; after slipping the Allied patrols it anchored off Chusan Island near Shanghai from 9:06 p.m. on 16 February until 7:00 a.m. on 18 February, when it sailed for Sanzenpo Harbor near Sacheon on the southern coast of Korea. It arrived there at 4 p.m. that day, and anchored overnight. The Completion Force departed Sanzenpo Harbor at 7 a.m. on 19 February and reached the Japanese island of Mutsurejima at 4 p.m. that day. After anchoring overnight, the Completion Force docked at Kure at 10 a.m. on 20 February. The ships of the Completion Force were among the last Japanese warships to reach the home islands from the Southwest Pacific.  Aftermath  The Allied naval commanders were disappointed by the failure of the 26 submarines directed against the Completion Force to inflict any damage on the ships. Fife concluded that this was due to the Completion Force's high speed, the poor weather conditions at the time of the operation and the Japanese ships being fitted with equipment that enabled them to detect submarines' radar signals. In a letter to Lockwood, he wrote that the failure of the submarines under his command \\"was a bitter pill to take and I make no alibi\\". Lockwood attributed the decision to deploy his submarines too far to the west on faulty intelligence, and told Fife that \\"our dope certainly went sour at the last moment. Perhaps I depended too much on it\\". The use of freighters and warships to carry oil was successful in increasing Japanese oil imports, and the total level quality of oil which reached the country during the first quarter of 1945 was greater than the amounts achieved in late 1944. Nevertheless, Allied submarines sank the majority of the merchant tankers that attempted to sail from Southeast Asia to Japan during February, and in March the Japanese ceased attempting to import oil from this source. Following the departure of the Completion Force, the only major seaworthy Japanese warships remaining in the Southwest Pacific were the heavy cruisers and as well as the light cruiser . These three cruisers did not attempt to return to Japan, and all were sunk by Allied submarines and destroyers between April and June.Blair (2001), pp. 852‚Äì855 After reaching Japan, Ise and Hy≈´ga were assigned to bolster the anti- aircraft defenses of the city of Kure and its naval base. Due to shortages of fuel and aircraft, the ships did not put to sea again, and both were sunk during the U.S. Navy's attacks on Kure between 24 and 28 July 1945. ≈åyodo became part of the Kure Training Force and remained in port until she was sunk on 28 July. The three destroyers also failed to survive the war; Asashimo and Kasumi fell victim to American carrier aircraft while escorting the battleship during Operation Ten-Go on 6 April, and Hatsushimo sank after striking a mine near Maizuru on 30 July.Nevitt (1998), IJN Asashimo: Tabular Record of MovementNevitt (1998), IJN Hatsushimo: Tabular Record of MovementNevitt (1998), IJN Kasumi: Tabular Record of Movement  See also  * The Channel Dash was conducted by the German Kriegsmarine in February 1942; it was a successful operation to return both battlecruisers along with an escort group including the , to German waters from France, using the heavily patrolled English Channel. *Operation Scylla, a minor-scale operation carried out by the Italian Royal Navy in July 1943.

Several sections of rebuilt local roads were incorporated into the Ferguson Highway, with the final link being completed through the thick forest of Temagami. The highway was officially opened on July 2, 1927, and was named in honour of Premier George Howard Ferguson. It quickly became an important access route to settlements and tourist areas in Northern Ontario. Throughout the following 30 years, the Ferguson Highway was extensively bypassed by the current routing of Highway 11.  History  Postcard photo of the Ferguson Highway circa 1940. This portion of the highway is now known as Wilson Lake Road. Although it was named for the man who campaigned to premiership on the promise of building the road, the Ferguson Highway was an inevitable extension of the Muskoka Colonization Road that came to be known as part of it. ;The Muskoka Road Construction of the Muskoka Road began at a portage site at the mouth of the Severn River where a harbour known as Washago was established. In 1858, work began on a trail north towards the survey line of the Peterson Road. Thomas J. McMurray established Bracebridge in the spring of 1861 at the northernmost point of the Muskoka Road where it intersected the Peterson Road.Parry Sound: Gateway to Northern Ontario. p. 47 The road was completed as far as Utterson in 1862. Over the next decade, work progressed on the northward extension of the Muskoka Road through Vernon Lake, Huntsville and the unsurveyed territory north to Emsdale, eventually reaching Burk's Falls in 1878. Between 1881 and 1887, the route was pushed to Sundridge, where an existing road connected to South River, at which point work concentrated on opening up access roads to nearby railway stations and resources. It would take a quarter-century for construction to resume on the road. In 1912, work began south from North Bay towards Powassan. Upon the completion of that section, the remaining between Powassan and South River was built. In 1916, it became possible for the first time to drive from Toronto to North Bay without travelling through Pembroke. ;Onwards to Cochrane Facing north along the Ferguson Highway through Temagami, shortly after being designated as part of Highway 11 In June 1923, Howard Ferguson campaigned to victory, with one of his pledges being the construction of a trunk road from North Bay to the farmland of New Liskeard and the mineral resources of Kirkland Lake and Cochrane. By then, a gravel road had already been constructed between Latchford and New Liskeard. This road started as a connection between the communities of Latchford and Cobalt, the latter of which was already connected with nearby Haileybury. In 1912, following the passing of the Northern and Northwestern Development Act, which allocated funding towards the development of trunk roads, it was gravelled north of Cobalt and extended to New Liskeard. After Ferguson's victory, construction began immediately on two sections. The first section was a gravel road built south from Latchford to Temagami; the second was a road, mostly gravelled, built north from New Liskeard to Cochrane via Earlton, Englehart, Dane, Swastika, Matheson, Monteith and Porquis Junction. Both were complete by 1925. The Latchford‚ÄìCobalt section was also given a gravel surface that year. In 1926, the final south of Temagami to North Bay way opened to traffic, having taken the longest to construct through the impenetrable Temagami Forest. The fully gravelled North Bay to Cochrane Trunk Road was ceremoniously opened by William Finlayson, the Department of Lands and Forests, on July 2, 1927,Myers gives July 1 as the ceremony date, but both Shragge and the historical plaque commemorating the route indicate July 2. and named in honour of Ferguson. The route was later assumed as an extension of Highway 11 throughout June 1937, following the amalgamation of the Department of Northern Development into the Department of Highways on April 1.  Route description  Today, the vast majority of the Ferguson Highway has been bypassed by the provincial highway network; however a select few sections were incorporated into the alignment of Highway 11, while others remain as portions of, from south to north, Highway 11B, Highway 562, Highway 571, Highway 573, Highway 112, Highway 66 and Highway 668. The remaining sections have either become local access roads or have been abandoned and subsequently consumed by nature. = Wilson Lake Road = Wilson Lake Road is a gravel road in the municipality of Temagami, Northeastern Ontario, Canada. It runs in a north-south direction, connected on both ends by Highway 11. Named after nearby Wilson Lake, it is about long. Wilson Lake Road was originally part of the Ferguson Highway, which has been replaced by Highway 11. By 1940, the portion of Ferguson Highway comprising Wilson Lake Road was bypassed.Temagami fishing vacation in Ontario - fish Temagami lakes Highway 11 is now situated on the east side of Jumping Cariboo Lake. Even though the Ferguson Highway was created for people to travel, most visited Temagami by train until the highway was improved in the 1950s. An old bridge built as part of the Ferguson Highway still stands on the road.

The Living Art Museum is committed to presenting, collecting and preserving works by Icelandic and international artists and in engaging with the discourse on contemporary art practices.  History  N√Ωl√≥ was founded by a group of twenty-six artists in 1978 as the first artist-run, non-profit organisation in Iceland. It began initially as a collection to preserve and archive artworks by a younger generation of artists that were otherwise ignored by the art public and authorities at the time; the founders were a diverse group of artists at various stages within their careers, and mainly associated with the fluxus movement and conceptual art. January 5, 1978 marks the inaugural meeting where the Living Art Museum Association was established and the initial foundations for its roll were set in place. Since that founding year N√Ωl√≥ has maintained the original goal to create a platform for progressive exhibitions and critical discussions on experimental art practices, but has also remained inherently flexible as necessary within smaller, mainly volunteer-based organisations. Equal weight has been given to exhibiting and collecting works by both Icelandic and international artists. On January 5, 2008 N√Ωl√≥ celebrated the 30th anniversary of its founding, marked by the publication of N√Ωlistasafni√∞ / The Living Art Museum: 1978-2008. In 1981 the Living Art Museum Gallery was founded and N√Ωl√≥ became a venue for exhibiting art along with collecting. This new role took some prominence over collecting and helped to make N·∫èl»Ø a foremost venue for performance during the 1980s. Originally the collection began in a 30 m2, rented space at Mj√∂lnisholt 14, Reykjav√≠k. N√Ωl√≥ then occupied a 200 m2 ground floor space in an alley at Vatnsst√≠gur 3b, where another storey was added in October 1983. In 1989 Islandsbanki purchased the building and terminated the lease, forcing N√Ωl√≥ to move the museum's holdings in a rented storage space at √ûingholtsstr√¶ti 6. A year later Vatnsst√≠gur 3b was purchased and N√Ωl√≥ occupied 560 m2 there until 2001. Between 2001 and 2004 the organisation had a brief stay at Vatnsst√≠gur 3 and in 2006 moved to Laugavegur 26. In early June 2014 the museum moved with its collection, archives and research facilities to V√∂lvufell 13-21 in Brei√∞holt, a suburb of Reykjav√≠k. For nearly three years N√Ωl√≥ had a temporary gallery space on the top floor of this location, in a former bakery. In early 2017, the Living Art Museum moved to the second floor of The Marshallhouse, downtown Harbor area in Reykjav√≠k. The house was a former herring factory and has been renovated by Architects Kurt og P√≠. N√Ωl√≥ shares the building with Kling & Bang, artist run gallery and Studio √ìlafur El√≠asson.  Focus  School visits to the N√Ωl√≥ gallery N√Ωl√≥ focuses on contemporary art, with the aim of providing a base for artistic creativity and experimentation in the visual arts. Along with producing 6 to 8 exhibitions in the gallery space each year, N√Ωl√≥ also promotes artistic expressions in various forms such as performance, screenings, school visits and workshops to increase program variability. In this way, the museum promotes a critical approach to visual art, while opting to question and reflect on its own current direction and activities at all times. The Living Art Museum does not represent individual artists, but throughout the years has been indisputably important to promoting artists within a nurturing, supportive and non-hierarchical relationship. N√Ωl√≥ is a small institution with an inherent flexibility, which allows the museum to constantly reconsider and revise existing ideas and experiment with new solutions, while attempting to find ideal circumstances for the artists working within it.  The board  N√Ωl√≥ is managed by a board of five members and a secondary board of three members, who are voted in on a yearly basis. Each member can serve for up to two years and with work done mainly on a voluntary basis. N√Ωl√≥ evolves under the influence and characteristics of each successive board and therefore maintains a fluid relationship with developing concerns in the field of visual arts. The range in perspective on contemporary culture offered through the individuals serving on the board at any given time ensures N√Ωl√≥ maintains a role in these discourses, keeping the museum‚Äôs engagements challenging and current.  The collection  N√Ωl√≥'s collection consists of approximately 2,300 artworks from 1950 to the present. The collection has been acquired through donations by artists who have exhibited or members that have been included as part of the history of the museum. Originally artists and members were required to contribute two works upon becoming a member with an annual donation following that, which means that over the past 35 years the museum has acquired a diverse collection of works by artists from abroad and within Iceland. This requirement ensured the growth of the collection, but has also highlighted questions and/or issues related to the role of a collection, storage and space requirements, along with archival and preservation practices. N√Ωl√≥ holds a considerable collection of artist books and prints, as well as documents that speak to the context and history of the works in the collection. Icelandic artists such as Kristj√°n Gu√∞mundsson, R√≥ska, Sigur√∞ur Gu√∞mundsson, Hildur H√°konard√≥ttir, √Åsta √ìlafsd√≥ttir, Birgir Andr√©sson, Brynhil√∞ur √ûorgeirsd√≥ttir, Egill S√¶bj√∂rnsson, Finnbogi P√©tursson, R√∫r√≠, √ìlafur L√°russon, R√∫na √ûorkelsd√≥ttir, Tumi Magn√∫sson, Ragna Hermannsd√≥ttir, Hreinn Fri√∞finnsson, Ragnar Kjartansson, Magn√∫s P√°lsson, Hulda Vilhj√°lmsd√≥ttir, The Icelandic Love Corporation, Finnbogi P√©tursson, and Helgi √ûorgils Fri√∞j√≥nsson are included, along with works by international artists such as Dieter Roth, Carsten H√∂ller, Dorothy Iannone, Douwe Jan Bakker, John Cage, Franz Graf, John Armleder, Joseph Beuys, Matthew Barney, Meredith Monk, Richard Hamilton and Robert Filiou. N√Ωl√≥'s collection can be accessed online at Sarpur, the collection database.  Archives  The archive at N√Ωl√≥ is a diverse collection of papers and documents connected to the museum and exhibition history, that was not a planned process, but rather arose out of the necessity to do so. Consisting of catalogues, audio and video files, letters, photographs, films, and recorded meeting notes among other things, the archive is continuously growing and being filled in. With accessible information about the artists, exhibitions, and other events occurring in relation to the museum, it serves as a source for research and a timeline of the organisation's history. As part of the 2008 anniversary program N√Ωl√≥ began a set of parallel initiatives for the organization and archiving of documents from the history of artist-run spaces and artist performance in Iceland. This ongoing Performance Archive and Archive of Artist-run Initiatives project is in creative collaboration with the Reykjavik City Archive, the Icelandic Art Academy, the National Broadcasting Service of Iceland, and The Film Museum of Iceland, with an aim to make the history of local artist initiatives accessible for future research and preservation. This initiative is an important effort in connecting N√Ωl√≥ and the history of contemporary art in Iceland with alternative ideas, concepts, theories, and perspectives on cultural history.  Archive of artist-run initiatives  A large part of the N√Ωl√≥ archive is built upon documentation of independent, artist-run spaces in Iceland. A variety of artist-run spaces have originated and been operated in Iceland over the last 35 years; all around the country, and in mobile and static forms. The common ground for these independent spaces has been in their role as a platform for progressive, experimental art, exhibitions of international artists and interactions between different groups in society and the art community. The abundance and productivity of artist-run spaces in Iceland has received international attention and these organisations have been considered very dynamic and influential. The reasons as to why artists decide to create their own platforms for engagement may be rooted in a need for processes of creative collaboration; many seeing these initiative as a part of their individual practice, along with an alternative outlet for expression. These types of organisations also arise out of a need for self- organisation where there may be a lack of infrastructure and specialization in specific fields of art, which provides the possibility of open space for new approaches. As an artist-run organisation, N√Ωl√≥ is not an exception in this case and is ambitious to embrace the history of local artist-run initiatives, while continuing to collect documentation on current and future spaces.  Performance archive The archiving of performance work documentation began at the beginning of 2008 and is currently still active. The results of this process were presented at N√Ωl√≥ as a contribution to the Reykjavik Art Festival. For this occasion an informative booklet, with texts and images of the projects was printed. The N√Ωl√≥ performance archive initially included documentation of 20 performance works from the period 1978-1981. Recently the documentation of 46 performances have been added to the collection. The process and collection has been made in close relation to the artists in question, and those who have used performance extensively in their art practice. Many local artists work with performance as a medium, but for only a few it is a center medium. The aim of this project is to preserve performance documentation and performance-related works, and to establish N√Ωl√≥ as a central museum for performance in Iceland.  Publications  N√ùLISTASAFNI√ê / The Living Art Museum: 1978-2008 - The museum has collaborated on and published numerous catalogues on artists and exhibitions, including an extensive retrospective publication on the history of N√Ωl√≥ in Icelandic and English titled, N√ùLISTASAFNI√ê / The Living Art Museum: 1978-2008, edited by Tinna Gu√∞mundsd√≥ttir. The publication was produced on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the museum, January 5, 2008, and celebrates N√Ωl√≥'s exhibitions, accomplishments and transformations over time. The purpose behind the publication was to create a holistic journal and source of historical information by way of making the archives and documents accessible to interested parties. This overview contains all basic information concerning the goings-on within the museum from the day of its foundation - as a political art venue, a venue for contemporary art and as a place where works are collected and preserved. The layout, designed by √Årmann Agnarsson, aims to make this information interesting and accessible, while providing a foundation of the history of the Living Art Museum. Archive on the Run Archive on the Run - In 2009 N√Ωl√≥ initiated the Uppspretta project, which later produced the publication Archive on the Run. Uppspretta was intended to examine the museum‚Äôs operations, providing insight into shaping the future vision following the intense process of registering and evaluating the museum‚Äôs collection and possibilities, also centered on the 30th anniversary in 2008. The process included work meetings where artists, curators and individuals with ties to the museum, based locally and in the Nordic countries, discussed their thoughts and interpretations relating to N√Ωl√≥. The result was a discussion in four parts hosted by the Iceland Academy of the Arts, which focused on the possibilities of museums and exhibition venues using N√Ωl√≥ as a focal point. \\"Archive on the Run\\" is intended to be a critical platform from which the future of N√Ωl√≥ is reconsidered, discussed and analyzed on different grounds, stemming from its context and history. The publication contains various ideas based on the following discussion subjects: The Challenges of the Gift Based Collection, The Tension between the Collection and the Exhibition Venue, Cultural authority and alternatives to stagnation, and The Association and the community. Contributing writers include Amy Howden- Chapman, Bjarki Bragason, Bergsveinn √û√≥rsson, Birta Gu√∞j√≥nsd√≥ttir, Elena Tzotzi, Gunnd√≠s √ùr Finnbogad√≥ttir, Maja Bekan, Gunnhildur Hauksd√≥ttir, Huginn √û√≥r Arason, Ingunn Fj√≥la Ing√æ√≥rsd√≥ttir, Katr√≠n Inga J√≥nsd√≥ttir, Krist√≠n √ìmarsd√≥ttir, Oddn√Ω Eir √Üvarsd√≥ttir, and Unnar √ñrn. The publication is edited by √Årmann Agnarsson, Gunnhildur Hauksd√≥ttir, Gunnd√≠s √ùr Finnbogad√≥ttir and Unnar √ñrn Au√∞arsson. S7 ‚Äì Su√∞urgata >> √Årb√¶r (not in service) is a publication based on the cross-disciplinary artist initiative Gallery Su√∞urgata 7, which ran between 1977-1982. The gallery was organised by young artists who at the time hosted a variety of cultural events including exhibitions, film screenings, concerts and performances, as well as instigating a platform for critical dialogue with the publication and art magazine, Svart √° hv√≠tu or Black on White in English. The project brings together two different institutions, the artist-run Living Art Museum and Reykjavik City Museum. The Living Art Museum holds original documents about the gallery in its Archive of Artist-run Initiatives, while Reykjav√≠k City Museum has preserved the building since 1983, when it was relocated after the gallery operation ended. The book was published in collaboration between the Living Art Museum and The Reykjav√≠k City Museum on the occasion of the exhibition S7 ‚Äì Su√∞urgata >> √Årb√¶r (not in service), which was part of the Reykjavik Arts Festival 2014, and edited by Bergsveinn √û√≥risson, Gunnhildur Hauksd√≥ttir, Hei√∞ar K√°ri Rannversson & Unnar √ñrn Au√∞arsson. √Ån titils / Untitled follows the exhibition Rolling Line, the opening exhibition of the Living Art Museum in the Marshall House, 18 March ‚Äì 11 June. The publication includes a large selection of archive material from √ìlafur's studio, acquired by the museum last year as a gift on behalf of the artist by his family. The book also includes an introductory text by Halld√≥r Bj√∂rn Run√≥lfsson, and interviews with √ìlafur's friends and contemporaries, including Hreinn Fri√∞finnsson, Hildur H√°konard√≥ttir, Kees Visser, Kristj√°n Gu√∞mundsson, Magn√∫s P√°lsson, N√≠els Hafstein, R√∫r√≠, Sigur√∞ur Gu√∞mundsson and √û√≥r Vigf√∫sson. The artist's own voice also comes through in fragments of interviews taken with √ìlafur and closely connected to a chronology following the life of the artist. This is the first time that a book is published on √ìlafur L√°russon's work.  Collaborators  The Museum has collaborated closely with various institutions on different projects and initiatives. On publications N√Ωl√≥ has collaborated with M√°l og Menning Publications, √öt√∫rd√∫r Publications, and Skaftfell - Center for Visual Art. Over the years collaboration with a large number of art organizations (e.g. British Council, Mondriaan Foundation, Nifca, IASPIS, former DCA) have taken place, as well as with numerous museums and galleries. N√Ωl√≥ is supported and funded by the members of the Living Art Museum, The Ministry of Education, Science and Culture and Reykjavik City Council. The National Museum of Art, The Reykjav√≠k Art Museum, The Icelandic Academy of the Arts, the Reykjav√≠k Municipal Archives, and The National Broadcasting Service (R√öV) have also collaborated on various projects. The Living Art Museum is a member of the Sequences Art festival and the Reykjav√≠k Art Festival.

In 1700‚Äì1701 he spent one year in F√ºrth, in order to proofread and manage the publishing of the manuscripts of the Zoharic commentary of his pupil Mordecai Ashkenazi. One year later, he and a group of followers settled in the Holy Land. Rovigo came from a wealthy Modena family, and was dedicated throughout his entire life to studying, collecting, and publishing Kabbalistic manuscripts.Scholem, Gershom. \\"Rovigo, Abraham ben Michael.\\" Encyclopaedia Judaica.

He was a close friend of Benjamin ben Eliezer Ha-Kohen Vitale of Reggio with whom he had studied Kabbalah in Venice under Moses Zacuto. Scholem also mentions in several places the correspondence about Sabbatean affairs he maintained with Meir bar Hiyya Rofe between the years 1674 and 1678 as a very important source for the history of the Sabbatean movement.Scholem, Gershom, Sabbatai Sevi: The Mystical Messiah: 1626‚Äì1676, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1973, p. 771.

Ferdinand recognized Z√°polya as John I, King of Hungary and ruler of two-thirds of the Kingdom, while Z√°polya conceded the rule of Ferdinand over western Hungary, and recognized him as heir to the Hungarian throne, since Z√°polya was childless. But in 1540, just before Z√°polya's death, his wife bore him a son, John Sigismund Z√°polya, and the agreement failed. John Sigismund was elected King of Hungary as John II by the Hungarian nobility.

The hill-streams of Cooch Behar carry debris and silt from the Himalayas and are shallow. During the monsoons the speed of flow of the rivers almost doubles and the rivers overflow the banks causing floods and devastation. The Raidak I and II, and Sankosh are the major rivers causing floods in the Tufanganj I and II CD blocks. The Tufanganj II CD block is bounded by the Alipurduar II and Kumargram CD blocks in Alipurduar district on the north, the Gossaigaon Revenue Circle/ Tehsil in Kokrajhar district and Agamoni revenue circle/tehsil in Dhubri district of Assam on the east, the Tufanganj I CD block on the south and west. The Tufanganj II CD block has an area of 265.69 km2. It has 1 panchayat samity, 11 gram panchayats, 141 gram sansads (village councils), 54 mouzas, 53 inhabited villages and 1 census towns. Bakshirhat police station serves this block. Headquarters of this CD block is at Chhota Laukuthi. There are 11 Gram Panchayats under Tufanganj-II Development Block/Panchayat Samity. Gram panchayats of Tufanganj II block/ Panchayat samity are: Barokodali I, Barokodali II, Bhanukumari I, Bhanukumar II, Falimari, Mahiskuchi I, Mahiskuchi II, Rampur I, Rampur II, Salbari I and Salbari II.

Marwari, Rajbansi, Munda, Rabha, Rajasthani, Assamese and Koch were the mother- tongues of smaller proportion of the population. People with other mother-tongues formed 6.9% of the population. The proportion of those whose mother-tongue was Bengali declined from 96.1% in 1961 to 90.3% in 2001 and the proportion of those with other mother tongues increased from 0.2% in 1961 to 6.9% in 2001. According to the West Bengal Official Language Act 1961 and the West Bengal Official Language (Amendment Act) 2012, the Bengali language is to be used for official purposes in the whole of West Bengal. In addition to Bengali, the Nepali language is to be used for official purposes in the three hills subdivisions, namely Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong, in the district of Darjeeling, and Urdu is to be used for official purposes in district/subdivision/ block/ municipality where the population speaking Urdu exceeds 10% of the total population. The English language will continue to be used for official purposes as it was being used prior to the enactment of these laws. The West Bengal Official Language (Second Amendment) Bill, 2012, included Hindi, Santhali, Odiya and Punjabi as official languages if it is spoken by a population exceeding 10 per cent of the whole in a particular block or sub-division or a district. Subsequently, Kamtapuri, Rajbanshi and Kurmali were also included in the list of minority languages by the West Bengal Official Language (Second Amendment) Bill, 2018.However, as of 2020, there is no official / other reliable information about the areas covered. Census 2011 provides language data only at the district and above level. In the 2011 Census of India, Hindus numbered 159,830 and formed 85.60% of the population of Tufanganj II CD block.

A German fighter-bomber dropped a single bomb on the school at 12:30pm, killing 38 children (32 killed at the school and 6 more died in hospital) and 6 staff and injuring another 60 people. Many were buried for hours under the rubble. The attack The German attack was part of a raid by 28 Focke-Wulf Fw 190A-4U3 fighter-bombers escorted by Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters, which took off at noon from an airfield in German-occupied France. The planes were to attack any targets of opportunity in what the Germans called a Terrorangriff (\\"terror raid\\"). The German pilot who attacked the school was Hauptmann Heinz Schumann (born 29 November 1914, killed in action 8 November 1943) from Jagdgeschwader 2. He was flying a Focke-Wulf Fw 190A-4 carrying a single 500 kg SC500 bomb. It is debated whether Schumann deliberately targeted the school, or simply attacked what looked like a large factory (the school was several stories high). The report mentions that a large building was targeted and destroyed in the raid and noted as a block of flats. Goss also says that the RAF had bombed Berlin three days before this terror-raid which was a retaliation raid demanded by Hitler. Due to inefficiencies of the warning system, the air raid siren had not sounded by the time the German planes arrived. Many children were having their lunch and the attack destroyed the area of the school where they were eating. Witness reports suggest the attacking planes first flew past the school and then bombed it on a second run. Another plane is alleged to have also strafed the playground and local streets. In the same raid four barrage balloon sites were destroyed in Lewisham, a large gas holder in Sydenham was set alight, a Deptford power station suffered three direct hits, and the President's House at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. Deaths and memorials Memorials to the victims of the Second World War and of the bombing of Sandhurst Road School, Catford. The bomb killed (either immediately or later in hospital) 24 pupils and 2 teachers in the dining room. Five more children were killed on a staircase and nine in second floor classrooms. The blast also destroyed the staff room killing three teachers and another was killed in a science room. Roughly 60 others were injured. The teachers who died were: Mrs Connie Taylor, Mrs Ethel Betts, Mrs Virginia Carr, Miss Mary Jukes, Miss Gladys Knowelden and Miss Harriet Langdon. Of the 38 children and 6 teachers killed by the bombing, 31 children and 1 teacher were buried together at Hither Green Cemetery in a civilian war dead plot. The mass grave has a rectangular stone surround that contains a raised tablet with inscription. The burial was conducted by the Bishop of Southwark Bertram Simpson, and over 7,000 mourners attended. The school now has both a stained glass window and a memorial garden commemorating the event. Aftermath Shortly after the raid, an inquiry into the events surrounding the attack and the responses of the emergency services was held at Lewisham Town Hall. It was noted that local Civil Defence services arrived at the school quickly and special thanks were made to volunteers, the Heavy Rescue Squads, REME soldiers billeted at St Dunstan's College and Canadian forces from Bromley Wood. Some issues were raised about how the police were unable to control parents at the school digging for their children, but given the nature of the incident this was noted to have been virtually impossible to stop.

Formed in 1940, the battalion served in the Middle East where it fought in Syria and Palestine before taking part in the fighting around El Alamein. In 1943, the battalion returned to Australia and subsequently took part in the fighting against the Japanese in New Guinea in 1943‚Äì1944. Their final campaign came in mid-1945, when they took part in the Battle of Tarakan during the Borneo campaign. The battalion was disbanded in early 1946. History The 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion was raised for service during World War II as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) in May 1940 and drew the majority of its initial intake of personnel from Sydney, New South Wales. The concept of pioneer battalions had originally been explored by the Australians during World War I, when five such battalions were formed and utilised as support troops assigned at divisional level on the Western Front. Notionally organised along a traditional infantry structure, pioneer battalions consisted of a headquarters and four companies, and were expected to serve to undertake minor engineering tasks during combat in order to free up trained engineers for more complex tasks. Four such units were raised during World War II to provide engineer support to the 2nd AIF‚Äôs four infantry divisions, and within the divisional structure, the pioneers were administered as corps troops under the direction of the divisional engineer commander. After undertaking training in various locations in New South Wales, in March 1941 the battalion was moved to Darwin, Northern Territory, to undertake garrison duties. At that time they were assigned to the 7th Division and they remained in the north of Australia until September when they were transported to Sydney. Two months later they embarked on the Queen Mary, bound for the Middle East. They disembarked in Egypt in November and after spending some time in Palestine, they were sent to Syria to undertake garrison duties following the completion of the campaign against the Vichy French forces there. Following this, the battalion was transferred to the 9th Division after the decision was made to bring the 7th Division back to Australia in early 1942 in response to Japan's entry into the war. In July 1942, the 9th Division was moved from Syria to Egypt and between August and November, the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion took part in the fighting around El Alamein, temporarily being assigned to the 24th Brigade when the 2/28th Battalion was virtually destroyed following an unsuccessful attack on Ruin Ridge. In early 1943, the battalion returned to Australia as the 9th Division was brought back from the Middle East to deal with the threat posed by Japan's entry into the war. After this, training was undertaken on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland before the 2/3rd were committed to the fighting in the New Guinea campaign around Lae in September 1943. The battalion's main involvement in the campaign was to carry out manual tasks such as unloading and carrying stores. Later, during the Huon Peninsula campaign, they landed at Scarlet Beach, north of Finschhafen, where they served in a defensive role and helped to turn back a Japanese counter-attack before undertaking various construction tasks around Sattelberg. Soldiers from the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion's D Company moving along a track on Tarakan In March 1944, the battalion was withdrawn back to Australia for rest and reorganisation. They subsequently spent over a year training in Queensland before taking part in the fighting on Tarakan during the Borneo campaign in mid-1945, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Anderson. During the landing on Sadau, in the Balagau Strait, the battalion's personnel manned machine-guns on the landing craft that brought the Australians ashore. Following this, the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion undertook engineering tasks around the beachhead. As the Australians advanced along the Anzac Highway towards the Japanese airfield, the battalion was withdrawn from construction tasks and put into the line as infantry. On 4 May, they were assigned to support the 26th Brigade and after relieving the 2/23rd Battalion, they commenced patrolling operations around the Tarakan town and the adjacent oilfields. The following day they launched an attack against Japanese positions located on two hills dubbed \\"Helen\\" and \\"Sadie\\" by the Australians. By 14 May, with artillery and air support, these positions were captured and two days elements of the battalion were able to advance through the Japanese lines, reaching the mouth of the Amal River on the coast. It was during the fighting on \\"Helen\\" in early May that one of the battalion's soldiers, Corporal Jack Mackey, performed the deeds that resulted in him being posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. The fighting on Tarakan came to an end in mid-June when organised Japanese resistance was overcome. Small pockets of Japanese troops remained at large, however, and so mopping up operations were undertaken throughout June and into July until these groups began to surrender due to their increasingly desperate shortage of food. During this time, the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion conducted barge patrols between Tarakan and the neighbouring islands, as well as undertaking foot patrols in the south of the island. On 15 August, following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Japanese surrendered and the war came to an end. Upon the completion of hostilities, the demobilisation process, which had begun to a limited extent in July, gained impetus. As a part of this, individual personnel were repatriated back to Australia, or transferred to other units for subsequent service, however the battalion remained in Borneo, undertaking garrison duties, and did not return to Australia until January 1946, when they were subsequently disbanded. Throughout the course of its service the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion lost 97 men killed in action or died of wounds or on active service. A further 262 men were wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one Victoria Cross, two Military Crosses, one Distinguished Conduct Medal, five Military Medals and 22 Mentions in Despatches. After the war, the functions of the pioneers were subsumed into traditional infantry battalions, which each raised a platoon of assault pioneers within their support companies. As a result, no pioneer battalions have been re-raised in the Australian Army since the end of World War II. Battle honours The 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion received the following battle honours: * Capture of Lae, North Africa 1942, El Alamein, South-West Pacific 1943‚Äì45, Finschhafen, Defence of Scarlet Beach, Siki Cove, Borneo, Tarakan. Commanding officers The following officers served as commanding officer of the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion: * John Alexander Anderson, * Alfred Victor Gallasch, * William Charles Douglas Veale.

Hasamba Third Generation) is a television series that broadcast on the IsraelI channels HOT3 and Arutz HaYeladim. Background: The original series A group of girls and boys set up a secret society called \\"Hasamba\\"; their adventures take place, first during the British Mandate and the struggle for statehood of Israel, and then as they battle their country's enemies: infiltrators, spies, criminals and other offenders. Though suspenseful, the writing is entertaining, with humor, as well as informative. It emphasizes loyalty, friendship, dedication, and courage. Yaron Zahavi (the handsome guy) and his deputy, Tamar (the pretty girl), are the first leaders of Hasamba. Later they are replaced by Yoav Tzur and his deputy, Rachel, Which are not mentioned in the series. The format of each story is similar: Hasamba's leader explains the situation and delegates tasks to each member. One member is captured and successfully escapes with help from the outside. The bad guys are punished and there is a happy end. Their secret meeting place is a real location in Tel Aviv, known as \\"The Electric Cave\\", which upon returning from a long stay abroad, the author discovered to be destroyed for the sake of building the Tel Aviv Hilton Hotel. All in all were published 44 books in the series, when the last one (\\"Hasamba's heroes beat again!!\\") Was written in 1994, the year of death of Mossinson. Hasamba books, especially the first sixteen books, were very popular among the youth and adults in the first two decades of Israel, and constituted an integral part of Israeli culture at that time. Plot The series tells the story of a group Hasamba, over 50 years after the creation, when they are around the age of 70. Tamar and Yaron married and they had a son named Uri, who was killed for some reason (so they think). Their granddaughter, Renen, lived with them after the death of her father. The real story on Renen's father, was Discovered in the first episode: Sunny Zorkin, CEO of Israel's largest cellular communications company, \\"Zorcom\\", grabbed it after guarding state secrets. In a failed attempt to change his memoirs, escaping one of the scientists in order to Tamar Zehavi the information was shelved her all that much years. Sonny sends a group of kidnappers to abduct the Tamar. Yaron, who finds it, tries to unify Hasamba. Thus the 70-year-old Hasamba gets dragged back into the action one by one. But they're not alone: Several guys and girls of the younger and fresher generation: Yuval, Luda, Iggy, Chofni and Renen find themselves involved and become Hasamba's third-generation counterparts.

Her work focuses on her life and experience as a springboard for meditations on the human condition where origins and identity in relationship to the individual in society are explored through scientific, psychological, and conceptual art themes. Chris Twomey works in series using a variety of mediums ‚Äì film, photography, painting, sculpture, digital media, sound, and installation - which can incorporate one or all these elements. Biography Twomey‚Äôs family moved around the country frequently: Chicago, IL, Nyack, NJ, Teaneck, NJ, Greenville, SC, Hixon TN, Rochester NY, before settling in Wyckoff NJ. Twomey attended Reed College in Portland OR, and eventually graduated with honors from Ramapo College in NJ with a BA in Sculpture in 1976. She attended Pratt Institute and obtained an MFA degree in 1979. In 1976, after receiving her bachelor's degree, Twomey originated an art performance group called ‚ÄúPerformance People,‚Äù inspired by other multi-media, conceptual artists like Meredith Monk, Vito Acconci, and Laurie Anderson. Twomey used film-making techniques to document the performances, becoming a filmmaker in the process. Later, immersion in art films contributed to a sensibility where subject matter, sound, time-based mediums and montage-like visuals were consistently utilized. This resulted in the creation of many short super-8 films in which Twomey used herself, as well as singing and composing many of the soundtracks. In a review of Twomey's retrospective exhibition at the Ramapo College Art Galleries, Daniel Rothbart wrote: > \\"Get Ahead, a film from this series, plays on themes of transformation, > gender-bending identity, sexual aggression, patriotism and other themes. > Twomey is the subject throughout, her head framed tightly by the camera, > smiling, singing sweetly and combing her hair (while \\"Get Ahead\\" is chanted > in a layered audio track composed and sung by Twomey).\\" Residencies at the Experimental TV Center and a grant from the Media Bureau at the Kitchen Center for Video and Film fueled Twomey's interest in filmmaking possibilities. > \\"In the 1970s, Twomey was deeply involved with filmmaking, creating works > that reflect the experimental ethos of period. Works like Get Ahead, What‚Äôs > the Point, Feed Us and Fun and Games suggest a dialogue with figures like > John Cage, Robert Wilson, Dick Higgens, Jonas Mekas, Stan Brakhage and Maya > Deren. These short films adopt surrealist juxtaposition, overlays, and > animation techniques to reflect some of the contradictions of female > experience.\\" --Eleanor Heartney Graduating from Pratt Institute in 1979 with an MFA, majoring in New Forms, as well as winning a 1978 Ford Foundation Grant for her multi-layered portapak video entitled Unmoved, Twomey later concentrated on exploring narrative filmmaking. She completed shorts ‚ÄúPhenelzine Sulfate‚Äù with support from the Hy Goldman Fund 1979, and One Way, which won a 1980 Creative Artists Public Service Grant sponsored by the New York State Council on the Arts and was exhibited at Museum of Modern Art. =Film and television career= After receiving an MFA, Twomey went to work full-time in film and television from 1984-1991. Twomey won a National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences award as editor of \\"Channel 2 The people\\" and shared many other film industry awards while editing for CBS News \\"48 Hours.\\" One of the few documentary videotape editors at \\"48 Hours\\" in NYC to become a producer, Twomey became a music producer for reporter Mark McEwen at CBS This Morning. During these years she also completed 4 full-length feature film screenplays ‚Äì ‚ÄúLast Monarch‚Äù 1991, ‚ÄúLove Vindiloo‚Äù 1987, ‚ÄúRed Bayou‚Äù 1986, ‚ÄúThe Comets Eye‚Äù 1983. In 1991 she won an American Film Institute Directing Internship and interned under director, Martha Coolidge, on ‚ÄúLost in Yonkers‚Äù written by Neil Simon. Photography and installation After having her first child in 1991 (Twomey had the last of her three children in 1998)\\" Twomey left the film business to resume a career as an artist with a full time studio practice, using baby images as provocative subject matter to challenge sentimental cliches. \\"Chris Twomey who often works with photography and computers, had submitted a large oil gridded into dozen rows of 16 squares, each filled with a tiny oil painting of a baby.\\"Baby Quilt\\" looks like a freehand contact sheet - an odd reversal for conventional influence pathways.\\" In 2004,‚ÄúOmni Series, Art and Genetics in a Digital Age,‚Äù a first solo show using the political/sociological subject of stem cell research, was exhibited at Tribes gallery in NYC. CNN‚Äôs Jeanne Moos created a story segment of the show that aired on Anderson Cooper 360. In 2006, Tribes Gallery exhibited Madonna Series, another multi-media installation, receiving reviews in Art in America, ‚ÄúASCI,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Scientist‚Äù and NYArts Magazine. Madonna Series was informed by classical Renaissance paintings, but used DNA as spiritual cosmology with working American Mothers and their children as subject matter. Subsequent solo exhibitions include ASTRAL FLUFF: Carnal Bodies in Celestial Orbit at CREON Gallery NYC 2010, Westbeth Gallery NYC 2010, and HP Garcia Gallery NYC 2011. In 2007, Chris Twomey and Peggy Cyphers founded Broadthinking, a curatorial project exhibiting innovative art which visually promoted progressive concepts exploring ideas for continued existence in the face of war, ecological destruction and inequity. \\"at Broadway Gallery in Soho is a compilation of installations of eleven individual artists metamorphing natural or waste products into creating (infusing) another form of existence or new life in the materials.\\" \\"Spearheading the 21st century's love affair with media, along with, and ahead of, the many artist who have recently discovered the potency of performance, film, sound, and manipulated photography, Twomey has a particularly innovative penchant for melding the celestial with the carnal, the ethereal with the scientific, the sublime with the cerebral.\\"‚Äù Astral Fluff:Carnal Bodies in Celestial Orbit (installation detail CREON Gallery 2010 In an interview about ‚ÄúAstal Fluff: Carnal Bodies in Celestial Orbit,‚Äù 2010 Twomey describes her process: ‚Äú‚Ä¶(in the installation) I have two elements here, these fluffy celestial shapes that are in the (installation), as well as the very corporal, earthly and grounded endurance oriented actions of being human and all the things we do every day (in the DVDS).

Israeli forces boarded the ship on 4 November and imprisoned Murphy and all the other activists on board, with one of them saying this was carried out in a \\"violent and dangerous\\" manner. Israel deported Murphy on 11 November. In 2012, Murphy set up the website ScamBridge.org for people wishing to share their experiences of the government's JobBridge scheme. In June 2013, he travelled to Istanbul, Turkey, to speak with activists participating in the Gezi Park protests. Murphy stood for re-election at the 2014 European Parliament election, at which he lost his seat. During the campaign he put his election posters on display before the official campaign start date, a move which risked fines of up to ‚Ç¨150,000. He said \\"people wouldn't be bothered\\" and defended the move as a response to Fianna F√°il candidate Mary Fitzpatrick, who had also put up her posters early. D√∫n Laoghaire‚ÄìRathdown County Council and South Dublin County Council forced him to remove them. During the campaign, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) upheld a complaint against the Irish state broadcaster RT√â which excluded Murphy from a report on the findings of a Sunday Business Post/Red C opinion poll on a news programme which they aired on 3 May 2014. D√°il √âireann: 2014‚Äìpresent Murphy was elected to D√°il √âireann for the Anti- Austerity Alliance, at the 2014 Dublin South-West by-election. As a TD for the Anti-Austerity Alliance and member of the Socialist Party, Murphy took a leading role in the We Won't Pay campaign, an anti-water charges organisation advocating non-payment. He spoke at many rallies and protests against both the charges and the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition government. His role during a protest against T√°naiste Joan Burton, in Jobstown, Dublin on 15 November 2014, brought criticism from some quarters after Burton's car was blocked, and she was unable to leave it for over two hours. Afterward, Murphy distanced himself from the actions of some protesters but defended the right to peaceful protest. On 9 February 2015, he was arrested by Garda√≠ at his home, in relation to the Jobstown protest, and taken into custody along with three other anti-austerity activists. He was released without charge that afternoon. On 12 August 2015, Paul Reynolds reported on RT√â's Nine O'Clock News bulletin that Murphy and others would be charged and that trials would occur in the Circuit Court, where penalties are harsher, instead of the District Court.Iffy leaks On 15 September 2015, Murphy was served a summons by the Garda√≠ on charges of false imprisonment of Joan Burton and her assistant. On 29 June 2017, Murphy and five other defendants, including Solidarity Councillors Kieran Mahon and Mick Murphy, were found not guilty of all charges. Murphy was re-elected to D√°il √âireann for the Dublin South-West constituency at the 2016 general election, as a member of the AAA‚ÄìPBP grouping. He left the Socialist Party in September 2019, but did not leave the parliamentary group (known since 2017 as Solidarity‚ÄìPeople Before Profit). On 30 September 2019, Murphy announced a new political group called RISE (Radical Internationalist Socialist Environmentalist). Murphy was re-elected at the 2020 general election.

He led the team that performed the first full face transplant in United States and the third overall in the world. Biography Pomahaƒç's parents were a chemical engineer and a school teacher. The family lived in the industrial city of Ostrava, today's Czech Republic, in a small three-room apartment, and used to spend weekends at their weekend house in Mor√°vka, a municipality in the Moravian- Silesian Beskids mountain range. As a teenager, Pomahaƒç became a passionate chess player, devoting as many as 40 hours a week to his hobby. He was inspired by Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov and made it to the major chess league in the country. Palack√Ω University Faculty of Medicine After finishing high school in Ostrava, Pomahaƒç became a student at the Palack√Ω University of Olomouc Faculty of Medicine. During the 6 years study, Pomahaƒç went on exchange to Boston, United States, which influenced his subsequent career choice. Pomahaƒç left for the USA immediately after finishing his studies in the Czech Republic in 1996. He was employed at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, where he worked for 90‚Äì120 hours a week. In 2000, Pomahaƒç married Hana Augustinov√°, an eye doctor and also a Palack√Ω University of Olomouc graduate. Together with their two children they live in Dover, a small village not far from Boston. They visit the Czech Republic once a year, when their children undergo Czech language tests in a school. =Face transplants= Face transplant recipient Jim Maki (left) with Bohdan Pomahaƒç Although face transplants were not the centre of his research work, by 2004 he became increasingly interested in the subject and devoted much of his free time to it. Great incentive came when Pomahaƒç met Isabelle Dinoire, the first person to undergo partial face transplant in 2005 in France. Dinoire told him that if the face had not been accepted, she was ready to undergo the procedure again. When Pomahaƒç asked another patient why he sought repeated surgery, he told the doctor: ‚ÄúI just want a cab to stop when I‚Äôm at the curb.‚Äù Brigham and Women's Hospital In 2007 Pomahaƒç became the head of the hospital's burn trauma centre and also head of the team specializing in facial transplants. On 9 April 2009 Pomahaƒç performed the second partial face transplant in the USA (and seventh in the world). During a 17-hour operation, a surgical team led by Pomahaƒç, replaced the nose, upper lip, cheeks, and roof of the mouth - along with corresponding muscles, bones and nerves - of James Maki, age 59. Mr. Maki's face was severely injured after falling onto the electrified third rail at a Boston subway station in 2005. In May 2009, he made a public media appearance and declared he was happy with the result. This procedure was also shown in the eighth episode of the ABC documentary series Boston Med. After that procedure was successfully completed, the Defense Department awarded a $3.4 million grant to the hospital in December 2009 to fund five face transplants, according to Col. Janet Harris, director of the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Program for the Army Medical Research and Material Command. On 22 March 2011 Pomahaƒç performed the first full face transplant in the USA (and third in the world, after full face transplants in Spain and France) on Dallas Wiens, 25, who was injured by an electric shock that removed his face. Pomahaƒç led the team of physicians, nurses and anaesthesiologists for more than 15 hours to replace Mr Wiens's nose, lips, facial skin, muscles of facial animation and the nerves that power them to provide sensation. Two other patients are already on the list for other operations funded by the Defense Department. They are Mitch Hunter of Indianapolis, an Army veteran who was in a car crash after his Army stint, and Charla Nash, a Connecticut woman who lost her hands, nose, lips and eyelids in 2009 when she was mauled by a chimpanzee.  Historical connections to transplantations  Pomahaƒç studied at the Palack√Ω University of Olomouc Faculty of Medicine. The University conducts practical education in Olomouc hospital, where the world's first successful human organ transplant was performed by Eduard Konrad Zirm in 1905. Brigham and Women's Hospital, where Pomahaƒç works, was the place of the second successful human organ transplant performed by Joseph Murray in 1954. = Etymology = \\"Pomahaƒç\\" means \\"helper\\" and forename \\"Bohdan\\" means gift of a god or given by a god in the Czech language.

Description Buddleja tibetica is a deciduous shrub of very sparse habit, growing to < 3 m high, more in diameter. The flowers appear before the leaves at the nodes of the previous year's growth, during March in the UK. The faintly scented flowers form compact sessile or subsessile clusters, initially dark purple, they rapidly turn pale on opening, ultimately becoming white. The distinctive leaves are < 10 cm long, and broadly lanceolate, though there is considerable variation in both size and shape; the upper surface covered with a tomentum which persists for several months, bestowing a greyish-white bloom. Cultivation Lord Wigram grew his plant in his moat garden at Windsor Castle, and it is from this plant that all the other known specimens in the UK were derived. Still very rare in cultivation, the shrub was propagated in 2007 by Peter Moore of the Longstock Park Nursery, NCCPG National Collection holders, near Stockbridge in Hampshire. The seed is infertile, and cuttings are difficult to strike; hardwood cuttings can occasionally be rooted in 100% perlite, and softwood cuttings can be struck in June under mist. Hardiness: USDA zones 8-9. Notable plants The oldest and largest specimen in cultivation is to be found in one of the outer gardens of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Grown from a cutting from the specimen at Crathes Castle in 1942, its longevity has been attributed to the comparatively dry climate of Edinburgh (average rainfall 676 mm per annum, compared with 1650 mm for Scotland as a whole) , and location against a wall.

Kumasi Central Market is in the rain forest bioregion of Ashanti on the Ashantiland Peninsula. Kumasi is approximately north of the Equator and north of the Gulf of Guinea. Kumasi is popularly known as \\"The Garden City\\" or \\"heart beat\\" of Ashanti and the Ashantiland Peninsula because of its many beautiful species of flowers and plants. The Kejetia market is the largest single market in West Africa. It has over 10,000 stores and stalls. About the market Right in the heart of Kumasi is one of West Africa's largest open air markets. It is bordered to the north by the Kumasi Cultural Centre and to the north west by the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. The southern part of the Kejetia market forms a border with Adum, the commercial centre of the cty. Virtually everything that one wants to purchase from a market can be found at Kumasi Central Market. Kejetia market ranges from gold jewelry and diamond jewellery handcrafted by the Ashantis, food, Ashanti kente clothing fabrics and footwear by Printex, spices, grains, and toiletries. If a person is traveling with someone, it is necessary to stay close since it is very easy to lose one another and easy to lose one's way. Kejetia market is a great place to buy fabric such as the Ashanti people's kente clothing, and see a huge Kejetia market, full of everyday hustle and bustle.  Redevelopment of the market  Due to the spontaneous development of uncontrolled sprouting of vendors, uncountable fire outbreaks the government set out a well thought through redevelopment plan of the entire Kejetia market enclave. The redevelopment was to undertaken in three major phases. = PHASE 1 = The first phase of the redevelopment started in 2015 and was valued at a cost of US$259,425,000 by the John Dramani Mahama government. The first phase of the project, included an ultra-modern market with 8,420 stores, a clinic, a police station, a social and recreational centre, ICT centre and a post office, a fire post, banks and a day-care centre. It was completed in late 2018. = PHASE 2 = Sod cutting for the phase two redevelopment of the Kumasi Central Market was done by Nana Addo Dankwah and Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, the Asantehene on 2 May 2019 for work to commence. The phase two is estimated to cost 248 million financed by Deutsche Bank of Germany with credit guarantee from UK Export finance to be completed within a time frame of 48 months When completed the market will have 6500 leased stores commercially, 5,400 stores closed, 800 kiosks, 50 restaurants, 40 livestock stores, 210 fish monger and butcher spaces and community facilities of 1,800 square meters. It is estimated to cover a total area of 172,197 square meters. Market management The huge human and vehicular traffic in and around the Kejetia market makes its management and law enforcement very difficult. Various methods of ensuring peace and order in the area are employed include the formation of a city guard group. The members of the group act as the Kejetia market's law enforcement authority. They handle basic traffic direction duties, anti-hawking activities, etc. However, they refer all cases that are beyond the jurisdiction to the Kejetia Police Personnel who have a station in the market. In 2010, the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly through the market managers Freko FD Ltd installed CCTV cameras around the market, with the aim of strengthening security at the station. The move was expected to clamp down on hoodlums, who ply their trade in areas including the Kumasi Central market, PZ-Adum, Zoological gardens and its environs. Fires National Fire and Rescue Service fire engines Fire outbreaks have historically been the major destroyer of the Kejetia market. The Kejetia market has had several outbreaks that have resulted in the destruction of stores, stalls and their wares. The destruction in most cases runs into several millions of cedis. One outbreak occurred on 19 September 2001, when a blazing hail of fire gutted over 150 stores at the old Kejetia market. It took the intervention of the Kumasi City Fire Service to fight the fire from spreading to other stores. The cost of items destroyed was not readily assessed. The cause was attributed to illegal electrical connections performed by workers of a private developer.

On 19 February 2014 the PLATO mission was selected in place of the other candidates in the programme, including EChO. EChO would have been the first dedicated mission to investigate exoplanetary atmospheres, addressing the suitability of those planets for life and placing the Solar System in context. EChO was intended to provide high resolution, multi-wavelength spectroscopic observations. It would have measured the atmospheric composition, temperature and albedo of a representative sample of known exoplanets, constrain models of their internal structure and improve our understanding of how planets form and evolve. It would have orbited around the L2 Lagrange point, 1.5 million km from Earth in the anti-sunward direction. SPEChO Following PLATO's M3 selection, a proposal to add EChO on the joint Japanese-European SPICA far- infrared telescope emerged. The proposed EChO instrument on SPICA (SPEChO) is a spectrometer covering light wavelengths from 5 to 20 micrometres, and will observe exoplanet atmospheres utilizing transit spectroscopy. As long with a potential to recover the original scientific goals from EChO, SPEChO will enable SPICA to conduct specialized exoplanetary science studies.

The bomb was placed near a bus stop, and detonated when Egged bus No.74 passed the station. The explosion killed 2 people, a British national: 59-year-old Mary Jean Gardner, a Scottish Christian Bible translator who was studying Hebrew at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Rothberg International School and Hodaya Asulin who died 6 years later on 22 November 2017, she was 14 at the time of the bombing. The bombing also injured 39 people. The attack was condemned by officials of Israel, the Palestinian Authority, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Spokespeople for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas, in contrast, praised the attack. The Israeli Police said the bombing was a \\"terrorist attack.\\" The perpetrators were not immediately identified. The Palestinian Authority brought in for questioning two Palestinian Islamic Jihad leaders, related to Israeli claims that the organization's Al-Quds Brigades were responsible for the attack. In September 2011, Israel arrested four Hamas militants, one of whom is an Israeli permanent resident from Jerusalem. The four are currently on trial by an Israeli military court for their role in the bombing. Background Two weeks before the attack, a pipe bomb exploded in a garbage bag on a traffic island in southern Jerusalem. A municipal sanitation worker lost his hand in the blast. Jerusalem had not suffered any serious terrorist attack since 2008, and has not experienced any suicide bombing attacks in 7 years, as a result of effective prevention. Jewish Week columnist and Jerusalem resident Carol Ungar remarked the attack ended \\"a decade of quiet, of voluntary amnesia\\" for adults as well as period where children could grow up without any knowledge of such events. Attack On 23 March 2011, around 15:00, an explosive device was placed in a bag next to a bus station in downtown Jerusalem, near where many passengers await their bus. The explosive device contained between one and two kilograms of explosives, and was packed with shrapnel. David Amoyal, owner of a nearby kiosk, who noticed the suspicious bag had been placed near the bus station, immediately told a group of people nearby to evacuate the site, and attempted to alert the police. A few minutes after 15:00, while Amoyal was attempting to alert the police, the device exploded near Egged bus # 74, which was passing the site and which absorbed the force of the blast. The explosion injured 39 people. In addition, it killed Mary Jean Gardner. She was a Scottish 56-year-old student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Rothberg International School, who absorbed most of the blast and later died of her wounds in the Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital. Gardner was a Christian Bible translator, who had for 20 years translated the Bible into the If√® language in the African nation of Togo. Danny Ronning of the Home for Bible Translators said he was certain that because Gardner absorbed the majority of the bomb's shrapnel, she shielded and saved the lives of three children.

The Blockade of Germany (1939‚Äì1945), also known as the Economic War, was carried out during World War II by the United Kingdom and France in order to restrict the supplies of minerals, metals, food and textiles needed by Nazi Germany ‚Äì and later Fascist Italy ‚Äì in order to sustain their war efforts. The economic war consisted mainly of a naval blockade, which formed part of the wider Battle of the Atlantic, and included the preclusive buying of war materials from neutral countries to prevent their sale to the enemy. There were four distinct phases of the blockade. The first period was from the beginning of European hostilities in September 1939 to the end of the \\"Phoney War,\\" during which the Allies and Axis Powers both intercepted neutral merchant ships to seize deliveries en route to the enemy. The blockade was rendered less effective because the Axis could get crucial materials from the Soviet Union until June 1941, while harbours in Spain were used to import war materials for Germany. The second period began after the rapid Axis occupation of the majority of the European landmass which gave them control of major centres of industry and agriculture. The third period was from the end of 1941 after the beginning of hostilities between the United States and the Empire of Japan. The final period came after the tide of war finally turned against the Axis after heavy military defeats up to and after D-Day, which led to a gradual withdrawal from the occupied territories in the face of the overwhelming Allied military offensive. Historical background At the beginning of the First World War in 1914, the United Kingdom used its powerful navy and its geographical location to dictate the movement of the world's commercial shipping. Britain dominated the North Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and, due to its control of the Suez Canal with France, access into and out of the Indian Ocean for the allied ships, while their enemies were forced to go around Africa. The Ministry of Blockade published a comprehensive list of items that neutral commercial ships were not to transport to the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire). This included food, weapons, gold and silver, flax, paper, silk, copra, minerals such as iron ore and animal hides used in the manufacture of shoes and boots. Because Britain and France together controlled 15 of the 20 refuelling points along the main shipping routes, they were able to threaten those who refused to comply, by the withdrawal of their bunker fuel control facilities. In World War I, neutral ships were subject to being stopped to be searched for contraband. A large force, known as the Dover Patrol patrolled at one end of the North Sea while another, the Tenth Cruiser Squadron waited at the other. The Mediterranean Sea was effectively blocked at both ends and the dreadnought battleships of the Grand Fleet waited at Scapa Flow to sail out and meet any German offensive threat. Late in the war a large minefield, known as the Northern Barrage, was deployed between the Faroes and the coast of Norway to further restrict German ship movements. Britain considered naval blockade to be a completely legitimate method of war, having previously deployed the strategy in the early nineteenth century to prevent Napoleon's fleet from leaving its harbours to attempt an invasion of England‚ÄîNapoleon had also blockaded Britain. Germany in particular was heavily reliant on a wide range of foreign imports and suffered very badly from the blockade. Its own substantial fleet of modern warships was hemmed into its bases at Kiel and Wilhelmshaven and mostly forbidden by the leadership from venturing out. Germany carried out its own immensely effective counter-blockade during its war on Allied commerce (Handelskrieg), its U-boats sinking many Allied merchant ships. By 1917 this had almost swung the war the way of the Central Powers. But because Britain found an answer in the convoy system, the sustained Allied blockade led to the collapse and eventual defeat of the German armed forces by late 1918. = Build-up to World War II = In 1933 Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany and, following the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the Anschluss with Austria and the later occupation of Czechoslovakia, many people began to believe that a new 'Great War' was coming, and from late 1937 onwards Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's chief economics advisor, began to urge senior government figures to put thought into a plan to revive the blockade so that the Royal Navy ‚Äì still the world's most powerful navy ‚Äì would be ready to begin stopping shipments to Germany immediately once war was declared. Leith-Ross had represented British interests abroad for many years, having embarked on a number of important overseas missions to countries including Italy, Germany, China and Russia, experience which gave him a very useful worldwide political perspective. His plan was to revive the original World War I blockade but to make it more streamlined, making better use of technology and Britain's vast overseas business and commercial network so that contacts in key trading locations such as New York, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo, Rome or Buenos Aires could act as a vast information gathering system. Making use of tip-offs provided by a vast array of individuals such as bankers, merchant buyers, waterfront stevedores and ship operators doing their patriotic duty, the Navy could have priceless advance knowledge of which ships might be carrying contraband long before they reached port. Chamberlain, Daladier, Hitler, Mussolini, and Ciano pictured before signing the Munich Agreement, which gave the Sudetenland to Germany. Initially the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, was not keen on the idea and still hoped to avoid war, but following his appeasement of Hitler at Munich in September 1938, which was widely seen as a stopgap measure to buy time, he too began to realise the need for urgent preparations for war. During the last 12 months of peace, Britain and France carried out a vigorous buildup of their armed forces and weapons production. The long-awaited Spitfire fighter began to enter service, the first of the new naval vessels ordered under the 1936 emergency programme began to join the fleet, and the Air Ministry made the final touches to the Chain Home early warning network of radio direction-finding (later called radar) stations, to bring it up to full operational readiness. A joint British‚ÄìFrench staff paper on strategic policy issued in April 1939 recognised that, in the first phase of any war with Germany, economic warfare was likely to be the Allies' only effective offensive weapon. The Royal Navy war plans, delivered to the fleet in January 1939 set out three critical elements of a future war at sea. The most fundamental consideration was the defence of trade in home waters and the Atlantic in order to maintain imports of the goods Britain needed for her own survival. Of secondary importance was the defence of trade in the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean. If Italy, as assumed also declared war and became an aggressive opponent, her dominating geographical position might force shipping to go the long way around the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa), but it was hoped to contain her with a strong fleet in the Mediterranean. Finally, there was the need for a vigorous blockade against Germany and Italy. =Pre-war situation in Germany= In Germany, where Hitler had warned his generals and party leaders that there would eventually be another war as early as 1934, there was great concern about the potential effects of a new blockade. In order to force Germany to sign the Treaty of Versailles, the original blockade was extended for an additional nine months after the end of the fighting in October 1918. This course of action, which Hitler called \\"the greatest breach of faith of all time\\", caused horrendous suffering among the German people and led to over half a million deaths from starvation. Germany also lost its entire battle fleet of modern warships at the end of the war and although new ships were being built as fast as was practical ‚Äì the battleships and had been launched but not yet completed ‚Äì they were in no position to face the British and French navies on anything like equal terms. The Great Depression in an international perspective. Triangles mark points at which nations suspended gold convertibility and/or devalued their currency against gold. Greatly deficient in natural resources, Germany's economy traditionally relied on importing raw materials to manufacture goods for re-export, and she developed a reputation for producing high quality merchandise. By 1900 Germany had the biggest economy in Europe and she entered the war in 1914 with plentiful reserves of gold and foreign currency and good credit ratings. But by the end of the war, though the UK also lost a quarter of its real wealth, Germany was ruined and she had since then experienced a number of severe financial problems; first hyperinflation caused by the requirement to pay reparations for the war, then ‚Äì after a brief period of relative prosperity in the mid-1920s under the Weimar Republic ‚Äì the Great Depression, which followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929, which in part led to the rise in political extremism across Europe and Hitler's seizure of power. Although Hitler was credited with lowering unemployment from 6 million (some sources claim the real figure was as high as 11m) to virtually nil by conscription and by launching enormous public works projects (similar to Roosevelt's New Deal), as with the Autobahn construction he had little interest in economics and Germany's 'recovery' was in fact achieved primarily by rearmament and other artificial means conducted by others. Because Germany was nowhere as wealthy in real terms as she had been a generation earlier, with very low reserves of foreign exchange and zero credit, Hjalmar Schacht, and later Walther Funk, as Minister of Economy used a number of financial devices ‚Äì some very clever ‚Äì to manipulate the currency and gear the German economy towards Wehrwirtschaft (War Economy). One example was the Mefo bill, a kind of IOU produced by the Reichsbank to pay armaments manufacturers but which was also accepted by German banks. Because Mefo bills did not figure in government budgetary statements, they helped maintain the secret of rearmament and were, in Hitler's own words, merely a way of printing money. Schacht also proved adept at negotiating extremely profitable barter deals with many other nations, supplying German military expertise and equipment in return. The Nazi official who took the leading role in preparing German industry for war was Hermann G√∂ring. In September 1936 he established the Four Year Plan, the purpose of which was to make Germany self-sufficient and impervious to blockade by 1940. Using his contacts and position, as well as bribes and secret deals he established his own vast industrial empire, the Hermann G√∂ring Works, to make steel from low-grade German iron ore, swallowing up small Ruhr companies and making himself immensely rich in the process. The works were located in the area bounded by Hanover, Halle and Magdeburg, which was considered safe from land offensive operations, and a programme was initiated to relocate existing crucial industries nearest the borders of Silesia, Ruhr and Saxony to the more secure central regions. The great Danube, Elbe, Rhine, Oder, Weser, Main and Neckar rivers were dredged and made fully navigable, and an intricate network of canals was built to interlink them and connect them to major cities. While the armed forces were being built up, imports were reduced to the barest minimum required, severe price and wage controls were introduced, unions outlawed and, aware that certain commodities would be difficult to obtain once the blockade began, deals were made with Sweden, Romania, Turkey, Spain, Finland and Yugoslavia to facilitate the stockpiling of vital materials such as tungsten, oil, nickel, wool and cotton that would be needed to supply the armed forces in wartime. Heavy investment was made in ersatz (synthetic) industries to produce goods from natural resources Germany did have, such as textiles made from cellulose, rubber and oil made from coal, sugar and ethyl alcohol from wood, and materials for the print industry produced from potato tops. There were also ersatz foodstuffs such as coffee made from chicory and beer from sugar beet. Germany also invested in foreign industries and agricultural schemes aimed at directly meeting their particular needs, such as a plan to grow more soya beans and sunflower instead of maize in Romania. The American journalist William L. Shirer, who had lived in Berlin since 1934 and who made regular radio broadcasts to the US for CBS, noted that there were all kinds of shortages even before the war began. In contrast to Britain, where rationing came much later and was never as severe, such was the need for metal that park railings were already being taken away to be melted down for scrap, and Shirer found that there were no oranges in his hotel restaurant. On 10 August 1939 Nazi officials privately admitted to Shirer that, after the conquest of Poland, the other eastern Balkan states of Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia also had to be occupied, after which Germany would be self-sufficient and no longer need fear the Allied blockade. On 24 August 1939, a week before the invasion of Poland which started the war, Germany announced rationing of food, coal, textiles and soap, and Shirer noted that it was this action above all which made the German people wake up to the reality that war was imminent. They were allowed one bar of soap per month, and men had to make one tube of shaving foam last five months. Housewives soon spent hours standing in line for supplies; shopkeepers sometimes opened otherwise non-perishable goods such as tinned sardines in front of customers when they were bought to prevent hoarding. The clothing allowance was so meagre that for all practical purposes people had to make do with whatever clothing they already possessed until the war was over. Men were allowed one overcoat and two suits, four shirts and six pairs of socks, and had to prove that the old ones were worn out to get new. Some items shown on the coupons, such as bed sheets, blankets and table linen could in reality only be obtained on production of a special licence. Although the Nazi leadership maintained that the Allied strategy of blockade was illegal, they nevertheless prepared to counter it by all means necessary. In an ominous foreshadowing of the unrestricted submarine warfare to come, the Kriegsmarine (navy) sent out battle instructions in May 1939 which included the ominous phrase \\"fighting methods will never fail to be employed merely because some international regulations are opposed to them\\". First phase Hitler invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, and Britain and France declared war two days later. Within hours the British liner was torpedoed by off the Hebrides with the loss of 112 lives, leading the Royal Navy to assume that unrestricted U-boat warfare had begun. Although France, unlike Britain, was largely self-sufficient in food and needed to import few foodstuffs, she still required extensive overseas imports of weapons and raw materials for her war effort and there was close co-operation between the two allies. As in World War I, a combined War Council was formed to agree strategy and policy, and just as the British Expeditionary Force, which was quickly mobilised and sent to France was placed under overall French authority, so various components of the French navy were placed under Admiralty control. In Britain it was widely believed that the bombing of big cities and massive civilian casualties would commence immediately after the declaration. In 1932 the MP Stanley Baldwin made a famous speech in which he said that \\"The bomber will always get through\\". This message sank deeply into the nation's subconsciousness, but when attacks did not come immediately, hundreds of thousands of evacuees gradually began to make their way home over the next few months. Scapa Flow was again selected as the main British naval base because of its great distance from German airfields, however the defences built up during World War I had fallen into disrepair. During an early visit to the base, Churchill was unimpressed with the levels of protection against air and submarine attack, and was astounded to see the flagship putting to sea with no destroyer escort because there were none to spare. Efforts began to repair the peacetime neglect, but it was too late to prevent a U Boat creeping into the Flow during the night of 14 October and sinking the veteran battleship with over 800 fatalities. The cruises of the Admiral Graf Spee and Deutschland, 1939. Although U-boats were the main threat, there was also the threat posed by surface raiders to consider; the three \\"pocket battleships\\" which Germany was allowed to build under the Versailles Treaty had been designed and built specifically with attacks on ocean commerce in mind. Their strong armour, 11 inch guns and speed enabled them to out-match any British cruiser, and two of them, the and the had sailed between 21 and 24 August and were now loose on the high seas having evaded the Northern Patrol, the navy squadron that patrolled between Scotland and Iceland. The Deutschland remained off Greenland waiting for merchant vessels to attack, while the Graf Spee rapidly travelled south across the equator and soon began sinking British merchant ships in the southern Atlantic. Because the German fleet had insufficient capital ships to mount a traditional line of battle, the British and French were able to disperse their own fleets to form hunting groups to track down and sink German commerce raiders, but the hunt for the two raiders was to tie down no less than 23 important ships along with auxiliary craft and additional heavy ships to protect convoys. At the start of the war a large proportion of the German merchant fleet was at sea, and around 30% sought shelter in neutral harbours where they could not be attacked, such as in Spain, Mexico, South America, United States of America, Portuguese East Africa and Japan. Twenty-eight German bauxite ships were holed up in Trieste and, while a few passenger liners, such as the New York, St Louis and Bremen managed to creep home, many ended up stranded with goods deteriorating or rotting in their holds and with Allied ships waiting to capture or sink them immediately if they tried to leave port. The Germans tried various ways of avoiding the loss of the ships, such as disguising themselves as neutral vessels or selling their ships to foreign flags, but international law did not allow such transactions in wartime. Up to Christmas 1939, at least 19 German merchant ships scuttled themselves rather than allow themselves to be taken by the Allies. The pocket battleship Graf Spee herself was scuttled outside Montevideo, Uruguay, where she sought repairs to damage sustained during the Battle of the River Plate, after the British spread false rumours of the arrival of a vast naval force tasked to sink her, an early success for the Royal Navy. =Contraband control= The day after the declaration, the British Admiralty announced that all merchant vessels were now liable to examination by the naval Contraband Control Service and by the French Blockade Ministry, which put its ships under British command. Because of the terrible suffering and starvation caused by the original use of the strategy, a formal declaration of blockade was deliberately not made,TIME, 18 September 1939, Vol. XXXIV, No. 12. but the communiqu√© listed the types of contraband of war that was liable for confiscation if carried. It included all kinds of foodstuffs, animal feed, forage, and clothing, and articles and materials used in their production. This was known as Conditional Contraband of War. In addition, there was Absolute Contraband, which constituted: * All ammunition, explosives, chemicals or appliances suitable for use in chemical warfare * Fuel of all kinds and all contrivances for means of transportation on land, in water or the air * All means of communication, tools, implements and instruments necessary for carrying on hostile operations * Coin, bullion, currency and evidences of debt The Royal Navy selected three locations on home soil for Contraband Control: Weymouth and The Downs in the South to cover the English Channel approaches, and Kirkwall in Orkney to cover the North Sea. If ships were on government charter or sailing directly to Allied ports to unload cargo or passengers, they would not be detained any longer than was necessary to determine their identity, but if on other routes they were to stop at the designated contraband control ports for detailed examination. Ships proceeding eastward through the English Channel with the intention of passing the Downs, if not calling at any other Channel port, should call at Weymouth for contraband control examination. Ships bound for European ports or en route to the North of Scotland should call at Kirkwall. Three further British contraband inspection facilities were established at Gibraltar to control access into and out of the western Mediterranean, Haifa at the other end of the Mediterranean in Northern Palestine, and Aden on the Indian Ocean coast of Yemen at the southern entrance to the Red Sea to control access into the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal. To patrol the Mediterranean and the Red Sea access to the Indian Ocean, Britain would work together with the French, whose own navy was the world's fourth largest, and comprised a good number of modern, powerful vessels with others nearing completion. It was agreed that the French would hold the Western Mediterranean Basin via Marseilles and its base at Mers El K√©bir (Oran) on the coast of Algeria, while the British would hold the Eastern Basin via its base at Alexandria. The Allies had practical control over the Suez Canal which provided passage between the eastern Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean via Port Said at the northern entry to the canal. The canal, built largely by French capital, at that time came under British jurisdiction as a result of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936. Contraband control at sea. The whaler from , with a boarding party of twelve men armed with revolvers, is lowered prior to inspecting a merchant ship. The party would check the ship's papers and navigation certificate to ensure that it was not engaged in supplying the enemy. The work of the actual inspection of cargoes was carried out by customs officers and Royal Naval officers and men who, together with their ships, were assigned to Contraband Control for various periods of duty. The job of Control Officer required great tact in the face of irate and defiant neutral skippers, particularly Dutch and Scandinavians who had a long tradition of trade with Germany. Contraband Control patrols dotted all practical sea routes, stopping all neutral ships, and making life very difficult for any who tried to slip by, forcing them into ports and laying them up for days before inspection, in some cases ruining perishable goods. Control ports were often very overcrowded, teleprinters constantly sending out cargo listings and manifests to be checked against import quota lists. Even for innocent ships, a delay of a day or two was inevitable; Contraband Control officers were under instructions to be extremely polite and apologetic to all concerned. Neutral captains often expressed utter astonishment and bemusement at the level of British advance knowledge of their activities, and soon realised it was hard to hide anything. Although numerous attempts were made to bypass the blockade, the net was extremely hard to avoid, and most neutral captains voluntarily stopped at one of the eight Allied Contraband Control ports.TIME, 8 January 1940, Vol. XXXV, No. 2. =Ministry of Economic Warfare= The job of co-ordinating the various agencies involved in the blockade was carried out by the Ministry of Economic Warfare (MEW), which in the last few weeks before the outbreak of war had been set up by Frederick Leith-Ross. Leith-Ross had not been put off by Chamberlain's initially lukewarm reception to his plan to revive the blockade, but had in fact spent the time after Munich to continue his preparations regardless. Leith-Ross recruited shrewd bankers, statisticians, economists and experts in international law and an army of over 400 administrative workers and civil servants for his new ministry. It was their job to compile and sift through the raw intelligence being received from the various overseas and other contacts, to cross-reference it with the known data on ship movements and cargoes and to pass on any relevant information to Contraband Control. They also put together the Statutory List ‚Äì sometimes known as the 'blacklist' ‚Äì of companies known to regularly trade with, or who were directly financed by, Germany. In mid-September the Ministry published a list of 278 pro-German persons and companies throughout the world with whom British merchants and shipowners were forbidden to do business, subject to heavy penalties. When shipments from these companies were detected they were usually made a priority for interception. One lesson that was learnt from World War I was that although the navy could stop ships on the open seas, little could be done about traders who acted as the middleman, importing materials the Nazis needed into their own neutral country then transporting it overland to Germany for a profit.The War Illustrated, 5 April 1940. Leith‚ÄìRoss spent the months before the war compiling a massive dossier on the annual quantities of materials the countries bordering Germany normally imported so that if they exceeded these levels in wartime, pressure could be brought on the authorities in those countries to take action. Diplomats from the Scandinavian nations, as well as Italy and the Balkan countries, who were also major suppliers to Germany, were given quota lists of various commodities and told they could import these amounts and no more, or action would be taken against them. A ship stopping at a Control port raised a red and white flag with a blue border to signify that it was awaiting examination. At night the port authorities used signal lights to warn a skipper he must halt, and the flag had to stay raised until the ship was passed. Arrangements for boarding and examining ships were made in the port 'Boarding Room', and eventually a team of 2 officers and 6 men set out in a fishing drifter or motor launch to the ship. After apologising to the captain for the trouble, they inspected the ship's papers, manifest and bills of lading. At the same time the wireless cabin was sealed so no signals could be sent out while the ship was in the controlled zone. After satisfying themselves that the cargo corresponded with the written records, the party returned ashore and a summary of the manifest, passengers, ports of origin and destination was sent by teleprinter to the Ministry. When the ministry's consent was received, the ship's papers were returned to the captain along with a certificate of naval clearance and a number of special flags ‚Äì one for each day ‚Äì signifying that they had already been checked and could pass other patrols and ports without being stopped. If the Ministry found something suspicious, the team returned to examine the load. If part or all the cargo was found suspect the ship was directed to a more convenient port where the cargo was made a ward of the Prize Court by the Admiralty Marshall who held it until the Court sat to decide the outcome, which could include returning it to the captain or confirming its confiscation to be sold at a later time and the proceeds placed into a prize fund for distribution among the fleet after the war. A disgruntled captain could dispute the seizure as illegal, but the list of banned goods was intentionally made broad to include \\"any goods capable of being used for or converted to the manufacture of war materials\\". In the first four weeks of the war, official figures stated that the Royal Navy confiscated 289,000 tons of contraband and the French Marine Nationale 100,000 tons. The Germans responded with their own counter-blockade of supplies destined for Allied ports and published a contraband list virtually identical to the British list.TIME, 25 September 1939, Vol. XXXIV, No. 13. All neutral traffic from the Baltic Sea was to pass through the Kiel Canal for inspection, but with a fraction of the naval forces of their enemies, the action was more in defiance, but it was destined to have a big impact on neutral Scandinavian shipping, who among other materials supplied Britain with large quantities of wood pulp for explosive cellulose and newsprint. Germany began by targeting the Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish pulp boats, sinking several before Sweden shut down its pulp industry and threatened to stop sending Germany iron ore unless the attacks ceased.TIME, 9 October 1939, Vol. XXXIV, No. 15. Germany then began seizing Danish ships carrying butter, eggs and bacon to Britain, in breach of a promise to allow Denmark to trade freely with her enemies. Up to 21 September 1939 over 300 British and 1,225 neutral ships had been detained, with 66 of them having cargo confiscated. In many cases these cargoes proved useful for the Allies' own war effort ‚Äì Contraband Control also intercepted a consignment of 2 tons of coffee destined for Germany, where the population had long been reduced to drinking substitutes not made from coffee beans at all. When the manifest of the Danish ship Danmark, operated by the Halal Shipping Company Ltd, was inspected, the recipient was listed as none other than \\"Herr Hitler, President Republique Grand Allemagne\\". From the beginning of the war to the beginning of October the daily average number of neutral ships stopping voluntarily at Weymouth was 20, out of which 74, carrying 513,000 tons, were examined; 90,300 tons of contraband iron ore, wheat, fuel oil, petrol and manganese were seized. Even more was done at the other two contraband stations at Orkney and Kent. =Shipping shortage= At the beginning of the war, Germany possessed 60 U-boats, but was building new vessels quickly and would have over 140 by the summer of 1940. While Britain could call on impressive flotillas of battleships and cruisers for direct ship to ship confrontations, these heavy vessels were of limited use against U Boats. Britain now retained less than half the total of 339 destroyers she had at the height of the battle in 1917 when the U-boats almost forced Britain to consider surrender. Orders were immediately placed for 58 of a new type of small escort vessel called the corvette which could be built in 12 months or less. Motor launches of new Admiralty design were brought into service for coastal work, and later, a larger improved version of the corvette, the frigate was laid down. To free up destroyers for oceangoing and actual combat operations, merchant ships were converted and armed for escort work, while French ships were also fitted with ASDIC sets which enabled them to detect the presence of a submerged U Boat. The massive expansion of ship building stretched British shipbuilding capacity ‚Äì including its Canadian yards ‚Äì to the limit. The building or completion of ships that would not be finished until after 1940 was scaled back or suspended in favour or ships that could be completed quickly, while the commissioning into the fleet of a series of four new aircraft carriers of the , ordered under an emergency review in 1936 and which were all finished or near completion, was delayed until later in the war in favour of more immediately useful vessels. Great efforts went into finishing the new battleships and before the Bismarck could be completed and begin attacking Allied convoys, while the French also strained to complete similarly advanced battleships, the and the by the autumn of 1940 to meet the Mediterranean threat of two Italian battleships nearing completion. To bridge the gap during the first crucial weeks while the auxiliary anti-submarine craft were prepared, aircraft carriers were used to escort the numerous unprotected craft approaching British shores. However this strategy proved costly; the new carrier was attacked by a U-boat on 14 September, and while it escaped, the old carrier was not so lucky, being sunk a few days later with heavy loss of life. Ships leaving port could be provided with a limited protective screen from aircraft flying from land bases, but at this stage of the conflict, a 'Mid-Atlantic Gap', where convoys could not be provided with air cover existed. Churchill lamented the loss of Berehaven and the other Southern Irish ports, greatly reducing the operational radius of the escorts, due to the determination of the Irish leader √âamon de Valera to remain resolutely neutral in the conflict. In the first week of the war, Britain lost 65,000 tons of shipping; in the second week, 46,000 tons were lost, and in the third week 21,000 tons. By the end of September 1939, regular ocean convoys were in operation, outward from the Thames and Liverpool, and inwards from Gibraltar, Freetown and Halifax. To make up the losses of merchant vessels and to allow for increased imports of war goods, negotiations began with neutral countries such as Norway and the Netherlands towards taking over their freighters on central government charter. =Navicert= Elsewhere, the blockade began to do its work. From Norway, across and down the North Sea, in the Channel and throughout the Mediterranean and Red Sea, Allied sea and air power began slowly to bleed away Germany's supplies. In the first 7 days of October alone, the British Contraband Control detained, either by confiscating neutral cargoes or capturing German ships, 13,800 tons of petrol, 2,500 tons of sulphur, 1,500 tons of jute (the raw material from which hessian and burlap cloth is made), 400 tons of textiles, 1,500 tons animal feed, 1,300 tons oils and fats, 1,200 tons of foodstuffs, 600 tons oilseeds, 570 tons copper, 430 tons of other ores and metals, 500 tons of phosphates, 320 tons of timber and various other quantities of chemicals, cotton, wool, hides and skins, rubber, silk, gums and resins, tanning material and ore crushing machinery. Two months into the war, the Ministry reintroduced the 'Navicert' (Navigational Certificate), first used to great effect during World War I. This system was in essence a commercial passport applied to goods before they were shipped, and was used on a wide scale. Possession of a Navicert proved that a consignment had already been passed as non-contraband by His Majesty's Ambassador in the country of origin and allowed the captain to pass Contraband Control patrols and ports without being stopped, sparing the navy and the Ministry the trouble of tracking the shipment. Violators, however, could expect harsh treatment. They could be threatened with Bunker Control measures, refused further certification or have their cargo or their vessel impounded. Conversely, neutrals who went out of their way to co-operate with the measures could expect 'favoured nation' status, and have their ships given priority for approval. Italy, though an ally of Hitler, had not yet joined the war, and its captains enjoyed much faster turnarounds by following the Navicert system than the Americans, who largely refused to accept its legitimacy. =U.S. reaction to the British blockade= Passenger ships were also subject to Contraband Control because they carried luggage and small cargo items such as postal mail and parcels, and the Americans were particularly furious at the British insistence on opening all mail destined for Germany. By 25 November 1939, 62 U.S. ships of various types had been stopped, some for as long as three weeks, and a lot of behind-the-scenes diplomacy took place to smooth over the political fallout. On 22 December the US State Department made a formal protest, to no avail. On 30 December the Manhattan, carrying 400 tons of small cargo, sailed from New York to deliver mail to Italy, but was stopped six days later by a British destroyer at Gibraltar. Although the captain went ashore to make a furious protest to the authorities with the American Consulate, the ship was delayed for 40 hours as British Contraband Control checked the records and ship's manifest, eventually removing 235 bags of mail addressed to Germany. In the U.S., with its tradition that \\"the mail must always get through\\", and where armed robbery of the mail carried a mandatory 25-year jail term, there were calls for mail to be carried on warships, but the exercise ‚Äì as with all such journeys ‚Äì was repeated on the homeward leg as Contraband Control searched the ship again for anything of value that might have been taken out of Germany. On 22 January the UK ambassador was handed a note from the State Department calling the practice 'wholly unwarrantable' and demanding immediate correction. But despite the British Foreign Office urging the Ministry of Economic Warfare to be cautious for fear of damaging relations with the US, the British claimed to have uncovered a nationwide US conspiracy to send clothing, jewels, securities, cash, foodstuffs, chocolate, coffee and soap to Germany through the post, and there was no climbdown. =Gruss und Kuss= From the war's beginning, a steady stream of packages, many marked Gruss und Kuss (\\"greetings and kisses!\\") had been sent from the United States through neutral countries to Germany by a number of US-based organisations, euphemistically termed 'travel agencies', advertising special combinations of gift packages in German-language newspapers.TIME, 5 February 1940, Vol. XXXV, No. 6. Despite high prices, one mail company, the Fortra Corporation of Manhattan admitted it had sent 30,000 food packages to Germany in less than three months, a business which exceeded US$1 million per year. The British said that, of 25,000 packages examined in three months, 17,000 contained contraband of food items as well as cash in all manner of foreign currency, diamonds, pearls, and maps of \\"potential military value.\\" When a ton of air mail from the Pan American Airlines (PAA) flying boat American Clipper was confiscated in Bermuda, the American government banned outright the sending of parcels through the US airmail. During this period, the Italian Lati Airline, flying between South America and Europe was also used to smuggle small articles such as diamonds and platinum, in some cases, concealed within the airframe, until the practice was ended by the Brazilian and US governments and the airline's assets in Brazil confiscated after the British intelligence services in the Americas engineered a breakdown in relations between the airline and the Brazilian government. The US travel agencies were eventually closed down along with the German consulates and information centres on 16 June 1941. =Phoney war= During the early months of the war‚Äîthe Phoney War‚Äîthe only place where there was substantial fighting was at sea. News of the successes achieved by the men of Contraband Control were rarely out of the newspapers, and provided useful propaganda to shore up civilian morale. In the first 15 weeks of the war the Allies claimed to have taken 870,000 tons of goods, equal to 10% of Germany's normal imports for an entire year. This included of petrol and enough animal hides for 5 million pairs of boots, and did not take account of the loss to Germany from goods that had not been shipped at all for fear of seizure. German preparations to counter the effects of the military and economic war were much more severe than in Britain. On 4 September a tax of 50% was placed on beer and tobacco, and income tax went up to 50%. For months previously, all able-bodied people in cities had by law to carry out war work such as filling sandbags for defenses and air-raid shelters, and it was now made an offense to ask for a raise in salary or to demand extra pay for overtime. On 7 September wide-ranging new powers were granted to Heinrich Himmler to punish the populace for 'Endangering the defensive power of the German people'; the next day a worker was shot for refusing to take part in defensive work. The new legislation, frequently enforced by the Peoples Court, was made deliberately vague to cover a variety of situations, and could be very severe. In time it would lead to the death penalty for such crimes as forging food coupons and protesting against the administration. Shirer recorded in his diary on 15 September that the blockade was already having a direct effect. It had cut Germany off from 50% of her normal imports of nickel, cotton, tin, oil and rubber, and since the war's beginning she had also lost access to French iron ore, making her extremely reliant on Sweden for this vital material. Germany now looked to Romania for a large part of the oil she needed and to Soviet Union for a wide range of commodities. In fact, apart from allowing Hitler to secure his eastern borders and annihilate Poland, the Nazi-Soviet Pact brought Germany considerable economic benefits. As well as providing refueling and repair facilities for German U-boats and other vessels at its remote Arctic port of Teriberka, east of Murmansk, the Soviets ‚Äì 'Belligerent Neutrals' in Churchill's words ‚Äì also accepted large quantities of wheat, tin, petrol and rubber from America into its ports in the Arctic and Black Sea and, rather than transport them over the entire continent, released identical volumes of the same material to Germany in the west. Before the war total US exports to Soviet Union were estimated as less than ¬£1m per month; by this stage, they were known to exceed ¬£2m per month. From the outset, although they had formerly been hated enemies, large- scale direct trade took place between the two countries because both were able to offer something the other wanted. Germany lacked the natural resources Soviet Union had in abundance, whereas Soviet Union was at that time still a relatively backward country in want of the latest technology. By the end of October 1939 the Soviets were sending large quantities of oil and grain in return for war materials such as fighter aircraft and machine tools for manufacturing in a deal valued at 150 million Reichmarks a year. The Germans maintained an aggressive strategy at sea in order to press home their own blockade of the Allies. Lloyd's List showed that by the end of 1939 they had sunk 249 ships by U-boat, air attack, or by mines. These losses included 112 British and 12 French vessels, but also demonstrated the disproportionate rate of loss by neutral nations. Norway, a great seafaring nation since the days of the Vikings had lost almost half its fleet in World War I, yet now possessed a merchant navy of some 2,000 ships, with tonnage exceeded only by Britain, the US, and Japan. They had already lost 23 ships, with many more attacked and dozens of sailors killed, while Sweden, Germany's main provider of iron ore, had lost 19 ships, Denmark 9, and Belgium 3. The Netherlands, with 75% of her commercial shipping outgoing from Rotterdam to Germany, had also lost 7 ships, yet all these countries continued to trade with Germany. Churchill was endlessly frustrated and bemused by the refusal of the neutrals to openly differentiate between the British and German methods of waging the sea war, and by their determination to maintain pre-war patterns of trade, but stopped short of condemning them, believing that events would eventually prove the Allies to be in the right. He commented; :At present their plight is lamentable and will become much worse. They bow humbly in fear of German threats of violence, each one hoping that if he feeds the crocodile enough the crocodile will eat him last and that the storm will pass before their turn comes to be devoured. What would happen if these neutrals, with one spontaneous impulse were to do their duty in accordance with the Covenant of the League [of Nations] and stand together with the British and French Empires against aggression and wrong?. The neutral commerce which Churchill found most perplexing was the Swedish iron ore trade. Sweden provided Germany with 9m tons of high grade ore per year via its Baltic ports, without which German armaments manufacture would be paralyzed. These ports froze in the winter, but an alternative route was available from the Norwegian port of Narvik from which the ore was transported down a partially hidden sea lane (which Churchill called the Norwegian Corridor) between the shoreline and the Skjaergaard (Skj√¶rg√•rd), a continuous chain of some 50,000 glacially formed skerries (small uninhabited islands), sea stacks and rocks running the entire 1,600 km length of the west coast. As in World War I, the Germans used the Norwegian Corridor to travel inside the -wide neutral waters where the Royal Navy and RAF were unable to attack them. Churchill considered this to be the 'greatest impediment to the blockade', and continually pressed for the mining of the Skjaergaard to force the German ships to come out into the open seas where Contraband Control could deal with them, but the Norwegians, not wishing to antagonise the Germans, steadfastly refused to allow it. Even so, by early October the Allies were growing increasingly confident at the effectiveness of their blockade and the apparent success of the recently introduced convoy system. A convoy of 15 freighters arrived in British ports unscathed from Canada bringing half a million bushels of wheat, while in France more important ships arrived from Halifax in another convoyed group. The French claimed that of 30 U-boats sent out in Germany's first major offensive against Allied shipping, a third had been destroyed, and Churchill declared that Britain had seized 150,000 more tons of contraband than was lost by torpedoing. In mid-October Adolf Hitler called for fiercer action by his U-boat crews and the Luftwaffe to enforce his counter-blockade, and warned the Allies of his new 'secret weapon'. Neutral ships were warned against joining Allied convoys, Scandinavian merchants were ordered to use the Kiel Canal to facilitate the German's own Contraband Control and the US City of Flint, which had rescued survivors of the Athenia became the first American ship captured as prize of war by the Germans, although the episode proved farcical and the ship was eventually returned to its owners. =Minenkrieg= Hitler's 'secret weapon' of the time was the magnetic mine. The Germans had used mines against freighters from the beginning, but now began laying a new type, which did not need to make contact with a ship to destroy it, off the English coast, using seaplanes to drop them in British harbours, channels and estuaries too narrow or shallow for submarines to navigate. They ranged from small mines dropped dozens at a time to large one-ton versions dropped by parachute on shoal bottoms which were almost impossible to sweep, equipped with magnetic triggers activated by a steel hull passing above. Over the next few days many ships of all sizes blew up in waters close to shore, mostly by explosions under or near the keels although the waters had been swept. Six went down in the mouth of the Thames, and the new cruiser was badly damaged at the mouth of the Firth of Forth. The British urgently set to work to find a defence against the magnetic mine and began preparations to recreate the Northern Barrage, established between Scotland and Norway in 1917 as a safeguard against increasing U-boat attacks. In his war speech to the Empire, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain declared: \\"Already we know the secret of the magnetic mine and we shall soon master it as we have already mastered the U-boat\\", but shortly afterwards two more ships were sunk, bringing the week's total to 24. Evidence that at least part of Germany's attack was with illegal floating mines came when a British freighter was sunk at anchor off an east coast port, when two mines came together and exploded off Zeebrugge, and when a large whale was found near four German mines on the Belgian coast with a huge hole in its belly.TIME, 4 December 1939, Vol. XXXIV, No. 23. Over the weekend of 18‚Äì21 November six other neutral ships were sunk off the English coast, including a 12,000 ton Japanese liner. Eventually, a method of de-magnetising ships, known as degaussing was developed, which involved girding them in electric cable, and was quickly applied to all ships. Other means of minesweeping were also developed, whereby the mines were exploded by patrolling ships and aircraft fitted with a special fuse provocation apparatus. =Export ban= From early December 1939 the British began preventing German exports as a reprisal for the damage and loss of life caused by the German magnetic mines. Chamberlain said that although he realised this would be detrimental to the neutrals, (Norway got nearly all its coal from Germany) the policy was in strict adherence to the rules of law and that whereas Germany's use of mines and submarine warfare had already caused many innocent deaths regardless of nationality, no loss of life had been caused by the exercise of British sea power. Before the war, 70% of Germany's export trade was with European countries, mostly the Netherlands, France and England, but the Ministry estimated that Germany's remaining annual exports were worth ¬£44m to South America, ¬£19m to the Far East, ¬£15m to the US, and that although nothing could be done to prevent the overland exports to Scandinavia, Italy, Russia and the Balkans, it was believed that German sea trade could be reduced by 45% by the measure. Angry at the British export ban, the German Government accused the British of having deliberately sunk the Simon Bolivar, lost on 18 November with the loss of 120 people, including women and children. They advised neutrals to shun British waters and trade with Germany, declaring that because of the defensive minefields and contraband control, British waters were not mercantile fairways subject to the Hague Convention regulating sea warfare, but military areas where enemy ships of war must be attacked. Prompted by Germany, all the neutrals protested, but the overall effect was to slow the flow of neutral shipping to a standstill. The Nazi leadership later grew bullish at the apparent success of the mine strategy and admitted they were of German origin, stating that \\"our objectives are being achieved.\\" In Berlin, William Shirer recorded in his diary that there were signs of a rush to convert currency into goods to guard against inflation, but that although the blockade now meant that the German diet was very limited, there was generally enough to eat and people were at that point rarely going hungry. However, it was no longer possible to entertain at home unless the guests brought their own food and though restaurants and cafes still traded they were now very expensive and crowded. Pork, veal and beef were rare, but in the early months there was still adequate venison, wild pig and wildfowl shot on estates and in forests. Coal was now very difficult to obtain however, and although sufficient crayfish were imported from the Danubian nations to allow an enjoyable festive meal, people went cold that Christmas. In fact, Germany produced large volumes of very high quality coal in the Saar region, but much of it was now being used to produce synthetic rubber, oil and gas. There were reports that Germany, which badly needed to raise foreign currency had been trying to export bicycles and cars to adjacent countries without tyres. The average German worker worked for 10 hours a day 6 days a week; but although he may have had enough money to buy them, most items were not available, and shops displayed goods in their windows accompanied by a sign saying 'Not For Sale'TIME, 16 December 1940, Vol. XXXVI, No. 25. Such was the belief in the supreme strength of the Royal Navy that some thought that the blockade might now be so effective in restricting Germany's ability to fight that Hitler would be forced to come to the negotiation table.TIME, 22 January 1940, Vol. XXXV, No. 4. Meanwhile, at the beginning of 1940 there were still 60 German merchant ships alone in South American harbours, costing ¬£300,000 per month in port and harbour dues, and Hitler eventually ordered them all to try to make a break for home. Up to the end of February 1940 about 70 had tried to get away, but very few reached Germany. Most were sunk or scuttled, and at least eight foundered on rocks trying to negotiate the way down the unfamiliar and hazardous Norwegian coast. The Germans tended to prefer to sink the ships themselves rather than allow the Allies to capture them, even at risk to those aboard. Such was the case of the Columbus, Germany's third-largest liner at 32,581 tons, and the Glucksburg, which ran herself ashore on the coast of Spain when sighted. Another, the 'Watussi', was sighted off the Cape by the South African Air Force and the crew immediately set her on fire, trusting the aircrew to bring aid to the passengers and crew. That winter was harsh, causing the Danube to freeze and heavy snow slowed rail transport, stalling Germany's grain and oil imports from Romania. The UK, having deprived Spain of her exports of iron ore to Germany entered into a deal to buy the ore instead via the Bay of Biscay, along with copper, mercury and lead to enable the Spanish, who were on the verge of famine, to raise the foreign exchange she needed to buy grain from South America to feed her people. =1940= On 17 January 1940 the Minister of Economic Warfare, Ronald Cross said in a speech in the House of Commons: :We have made a good start, we must bear in mind that Germany does not have the same resources she had some 25 years ago. Her resources in gold and foreign currency are smaller; her stocks of industrial raw materials are far smaller. At the end of four and a half months, Germany is in something like the same economic stress she was in after two years of the last war. Despite newsreels showing the effectiveness and power of the Nazi Blitzkrieg, which even her enemies believed, Germany was unable to afford a prolonged war. In order to buy from abroad without credit or foreign exchange (cash), a nation needed goods or gold to offer, but the British export ban prevented her from raising revenue. In World War I, even after two years of war Germany still had gold reserves worth 2.5m marks and over 30 billion marks invested abroad, giving her easy access to exports.TIME, 29 January 1940, Vol. XXXV, No. 5. By this early stage of World War II, her gold reserves were down to around half a billion marks and her credit was almost nil, so any imports had to be paid for by barter, as with the high-technology equipment sent to Russia or coal to Italy. In February 1940 Karl Ritter, who had brokered huge pre-war barter agreements with Brazil, visited Moscow and, despite finding Stalin an incredibly fierce negotiator, an increased trade deal was eventually signed between Germany and Russia. It was valued at 640 million Reichmarks in addition to that previously agreed, for which Germany would supply heavy naval guns, thirty of her latest aircraft including the Messerschmitt 109, Messerschmitt 110 and Junkers 88, locomotives, turbines, generators, the unfinished cruiser and the plans to the battleship . In return Russia supplied in the first year one million tons of cereal, ¬Ω million tons of wheat, 900,000 tons of oil, 100,000 tons of cotton, ¬Ω million tons of phosphates, one million tons of soya beans and other goods. Although the Germans had been able to find numerous ways of beating the blockade, shortages were now so severe that on 30 March 1940, when he was gearing up for his renewed Blitzkrieg in the west, Hitler ordered that delivery of goods in payment to Russia should take priority even over those to his own armed forces. After the fall of France Hitler, intending to invade Russia the following year, declared that the trade need continue only until the spring of 1941, after which the Nazis intended to take all they needed. As more U-boats were commissioned into the German navy, the terrible toll on neutral merchant shipping intensified. After the first 6 months of the war, Norway had lost 49 ships with 327 men dead; Denmark 19 ships for 225 sailors killed and Sweden 32 ships for 243 men lost. In early March, Admiral Raeder was interviewed by an American correspondent from NBC regarding the alleged use of unrestrained submarine warfare. Raeder maintained that because the British blockade was illegal, the Germans were entitled to respond with 'similar methods', and that because the British government had armed many of its merchant ships and used civilians to man coastal patrol vessels and minesweepers, any British ship sighted was considered a legitimate target. Raeder said that neutrals would only be liable to attack if they behaved as belligerents i.e. by zig-zagging or navigating without lights. The paradox with this argument ‚Äì as the neutral countries were quick to point out ‚Äì was that Germany was benefiting from the very same maritime activity they were trying so hard to destroy. On 6 April, after the sinking of the Norwegian mail steamer Mira, the Norwegian Foreign Minister Professor Koht, referring to 21 protests made to belligerents about breaches to her neutrality, made a statement about the German sinking of Norwegian ships by U-boats and aircraft. \\"We cannot understand how men of the German forces can find such a practice in accordance with their honour or humanitarian feelings\\". A few hours later another ship, the Navarra was torpedoed without warning, with the loss of 12 Norwegian seamen, by a U-boat which did not stop to pick up survivors. =Intensification of the blockade= Despite impressive statistics of the quantities of contraband captured, by the spring of 1940 the optimism of the British government over the success of the blockade appeared premature and a feeling developed that Germany was managing to maintain and even increase imports. Although the MEW tried to prevent it, neighbouring neutral countries continued to trade with Germany. In some cases, as with the crucial Swedish iron ore trade, it was done openly, but elsewhere, neutrals secretly acted as a conduit for supplies of materials that would otherwise be confiscated if sent directly to Germany. A third of Dutchmen derived their livelihood from German trade, and Dutch traders were long suspected of acting as middle men in the supply of copper, tin, oil and industrial diamonds from America. Official figures showed that in the first 5 months of war, the Netherlands' imports of key materials from the US increased by ¬£4.25m, but also Norway's purchases in the same area increased threefold to ¬£3m a year, Sweden's by ¬£5m and Switzerland's by ¬£2m. Prominent in these purchases were cotton, petrol, iron, steel and copper ‚Äì materials essential for waging war. While some increases may have been inflationary, some from a desire to build up their own armed forces or to stockpile reserves, it was exactly the type of activity the Ministry was trying to prevent. American companies were prevented from openly supplying arms to belligerents by the Neutrality Acts, (an amendment was made on 21 September in the form of Cash and Carry) but no restrictions applied to raw materials. During the last 4 months of 1939, exports from the US to the 13 states capable of acting as middlemen to Germany amounted to ¬£52m compared to ¬£35m for the same period in 1938. By contrast, Britain and France spent ¬£67m and ¬£60m in the same periods respectively, and according to a writer in the New York World Telegram, exports to the 8 countries bordering Germany exceeded the loss of US exports previously sent directly to Germany. But by far the biggest hole in the blockade was in the Balkans. Together Yugoslavia, Romania and Bulgaria annually exported to Germany a large part of their surplus oil, chromium, bauxite, pyrites, oil-bearing nuts, maize, wheat, meat and tobacco. Germany also made big purchases in Greece and Turkey and viewed the region as part of its supply hinterland. Before the war, Britain recognised Germany's special interest in the region and took a very small percentage of this market, but now, via the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation they used their financial power to compete in the Balkans, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, underselling and overbidding in markets to deprive Germany of goods, although Germany was so desperate to maintain supplies that they paid considerably over the normal market rate. As elsewhere, Germany paid in kind with military equipment, for which they were greatly aided with their acquisition of the Czech Skoda armaments interests. Germany was almost entirely dependent on Hungary and Yugoslavia for bauxite, used in the production of Duralumin, a copper alloy of aluminium critical to aircraft production. The British attempted to stop the bauxite trade by sending undercover agents to blast the Iron Gate, the narrow gorge where the Danube cuts through the Carpathian Mountains by sailing a fleet of dynamite barges down the river, but the plan was prevented by Romanian police acting on a tip-off from the pro-German Iron Guard. Despite their declared neutrality, the politically unstable Balkan nations found themselves in an uncomfortable position, surrounded by Germany to the North, Italy to the West and Soviet Union to the East, with little room to refuse German veiled threats that, unless they continued to supply what was requested, they would suffer the same fate as Poland. Romania, which had made considerable territorial gains after World War I, exported a large proportion of the oil from its Ploie»ôti site to Britain, its main guarantor of national sovereignty. Romania's production was about equal to that of Ohio, ranked 16th producer in the US, then a major oil-producing nation. The largest refinery, Astra Rom√¢nƒÉ, processed two million tons of petroleum a year but, as Britain's fortunes waned from the beginning of 1940, Romania turned to Germany using its oil as a bargaining tool, hoping for protection from Soviet Union. On 29 May 1940 it stopped sending its oil to Britain, and signed an arms and oil pact with Germany; Romania was soon providing half her oil needs. Britain was able to arrange alternative supplies with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Agreement, signed on 28 August 1940. The British Supreme War Council met in London on 28 March to discuss ways to intensify the blockade. According to The Economist, in April 1940 the war was costing the UK¬£5m per day out of total government expenditure of ¬£6.5 ‚Äì 7m per day. This was during the phoney war, before the fighting on land and air had begun. The Prime Minister said that, while it was out of the question to purchase all exportable surpluses, concentration on certain selected commodities such as minerals, fats and oil could have a useful effect, and announced a deal for Britain to acquire the entire export surplus of whale oil from Norway. Later Britain signed the Anglo-Swiss Trade Deal, and negotiations for war trade agreements were also concluded with Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Commercial agreements were negotiated with Spain, Turkey, and Greece, aimed at limiting material to Germany. A reconstruction of the Operation Gunnerside team planting explosives to destroy the cascade of electrolysis chambers in the Vemork heavy water (deuterium) plant. Chamberlain also indicated that steps were being taken to stop the Swedish iron ore trade, and a few days later the Norwegian coast was mined in Operation Wilfred. But perhaps the most important measure taken at this time was the setting up of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) As Professor William MacKenzie recounts in his book The Secret History, the official government history of the organisation written in 1946 with access to SOE files later destroyed, but classified until 2000, its origins go back to March 1939 following the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. It was set up by Lord Halifax with funding from the Secret Vote authorised by Prime Minister Chamberlain. In July 1940 Winston Churchill asked the Lord President (Neville Chamberlain) to define its structure and the document held at Kew CAB66/1 Extract 2 thereafter became known as the Charter of SOE. This Charter also defined the relationship of various organs of state including the security and police services with one another and initially the minister was the new Minister of Economic Warfare Hugh Dalton. Though very few people knew of it at the time, the new organisation, the earlier version of which carried out the attempt to dynamite the Iron Gate on the Danube, marked a new direction in the Economic War that would pay dividends later on, providing vital intelligence on potential strategic targets for the offensive bomber campaigns that came later in the war. There were turf wars from time to time with SIS who did not want to risk sources being compromised by SOE sabotage of enemy targets. =Bombing of Germany= Shortly after the German invasion of the Low Countries and France, the British took the first tentative steps towards the opening of a strategic air offensive aimed at carrying the fight to Germany. On 11 May 1940 the RAF bombed the city of M√∂nchengladbach. On the night of 15/16 May 1940, RAF Bomber Command, which until that point had been used for little more than attacking coastal targets and dropping propaganda leaflets, set off on a night time raid on oil production and railway marshalling yards in the Ruhr district. The mining and manufacturing region of the Ruhr, often likened to the 'Black Country' in the Midlands of England, was one of the world's greatest concentrations of metal production and processing facilities as well as chemical and textile factories; the Ruhr was also home to several synthetic oil production plants. So much smog was produced by these industries that precision bombing was almost impossible. As Germany's most important industrial region, it had been equipped with strong air defenses ‚Äì Hermann G√∂ring had already declared, \\"The Ruhr will not be subjected to a single bomb. If an enemy bomber reaches the Ruhr, my name is not Hermann G√∂ring!\\" Because of the smog and the lack of aircraft fitted for aerial photography, the British were unable to determine how effective the raid had been; in fact the damage was negligible. Second phase =Fall of France= The signing of the armistice with France in the Compi√®gne Forest on 24 June 1940 greatly changed the conditions of the Economic War. Hitler assumed control over the whole of Western Europe and Scandinavia (except for Sweden and Switzerland) from the north tip of Norway high above the Arctic Circle to the Pyrenees on the border with Spain, and from the River Bug in Poland to the English Channel. Germany established new airfields and U-boat bases all the way down the West Norwegian and European coasts. On 30 June 1940 German occupation of the Channel Islands began. In early August Germans installed Dover Strait coastal guns. From early July the German air force began attacking convoys in the English channel from its new bases and cross-channel guns shelled the Kentish coast in the opening stages of the Battle of Britain. On 17 August, following his inability to convince the British to make peace, Hitler announced a general blockade of the entire British Isles and gave the order to prepare for a full invasion of England codenamed Operation Sea Lion. On 1 August Italy, having joined the war, established a submarine base in Bordeaux. Its submarines were more suited to the Mediterranean, but they successfully ran the British gauntlet through the Straits of Gibraltar and joined the Atlantic blockade. On 20 August Benito Mussolini announced a blockade of all British ports in the Mediterranean, and over the next few months the region would experience a sharp increase in fighting. Meanwhile, in Spain, which had still not recovered from her own civil war in which over one million died and which was in the grip of famine, General Francisco Franco continued to resist German attempts to persuade him to enter the war on the Axis side. Spain supplied Britain with iron ore from the Bay of Biscay, but, as a potential foe, she was a huge threat to British interests as she could easily restrict British naval access into the Mediterranean, either by shelling the Rock of Gibraltar or by allowing the Germans to lay siege to it from the mainland. Although Spain could gain the restoration of the rock itself and Catalonia under French administration, Franco could see Britain was far from defeated and that British forces backed by its huge powerful navy would occupy the Canary Islands. At this point Franco saw that the Royal Navy had reduced the German navy in Norway to an impotent surface threat, the Luftwaffe had lost the Battle of Britain, the Royal Navy had destroyed much of the French fleet at Mers-el-K√©bir, had also destroyed Italian battleships at Taranto and the British Army was routing the Italian army in North & East Africa. Franco continued to play for time. Franco made excessive demands of Hitler which he knew could not be satisfied as his personal price for participation, such as the ceding of most of Morocco and much of Algeria to Spain by France. Operation Felix failed to materialise. American opinion was shocked at the fall of France and the previous isolationist sentiment, which led to the Neutrality Acts from 1935 onwards, was slowly giving rise to a new realism. Roosevelt had already managed to negotiate an amendment to the acts on 21 September 1939, known as Cash and Carry, which though in theory maintained America's impartiality, blatantly favoured Britain and her Commonwealth. Under the new plan, weapons could now be bought by any belligerent providing they paid up front and took responsibility for delivery, but whereas Germany had virtually no foreign exchange and was unable to transport much material across the Atlantic, Britain had large reserves of gold and foreign currency, and while U-boats would be a threat, the likelihood was that her vast navy would ensure that the majority of equipment safely delivered to port. British attack on the French fleet at Mers-el-K√©bir to prevent it from falling into German hands The US now accepted that it needed to increase spending for its own defense, especially with the growing threat of Japan, but there was real concern that Britain would fall before the weapons were delivered. Despite the success in evacuating a third of a million men at Dunkirk and the later evacuations from St Malo and St Nazaire, the British army left behind 2,500 heavy guns, 64,000 vehicles, 20,000 motor cycles and well over half a million tons of stores and ammunition. To help in the interim, Congress agreed to let Britain have a million mothballed First World War rifles, stored in grease with around fifty rounds of ammunition for each. But, following the British attack on the French fleet at Oran on 4 July to prevent it from falling into German hands, the British were proving they would do whatever was necessary to continue the fight, and Roosevelt was now winning his campaign to convince Congress to be even more supportive of Britain, with the Destroyers for Bases Agreement and with the approval of a British order for 4,000 tanks. =Compulsory Navicerts= Because of Germany's new proximity on the west European coastline and the decrease in shipping traffic, ships which would normally have been used for patrolling the high seas were diverted to more urgent tasks.UK National Archives. Britain discontinued its contraband control bases at Weymouth and The Downs and removed all but a skeleton staff from the control base at Kirkwall to continue searching the few ships bound for Sweden, Finland, Russia and her recently annexed Baltic satellites ( Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania surrendered on 21 June 1940 ). The Navicert system was greatly extended, introducing compulsory Navicerts and ships' warrants in an attempt to prevent contraband being loaded in the first place. Any consignment going to or from ports without a certificate of non-enemy origin and any ship without a ships Navicert became liable to seizure. The lost Dutch and Danish supplies of meat and dairy products were replaced by sources in Ireland and New Zealand. Canada held a whole year's surplus of wheat, while the U.S. reserve was estimated to be the greatest in history, but Britain was suffering very heavy shipping losses as a result of expanding U-boat numbers. Virtually all Dutch and Belgian ships not captured by the Germans joined the British merchant fleet, which together with the tonnage contributed by Norway and Denmark added about one-third to Britain's merchant marine, giving them a large surplus of vessels. To prevent the enemy gaining a route to acquire supplies, the occupied countries and the unoccupied (Vichy) French zone immediately became subject to the blockade, with severe shortages and extreme hardship quickly following. Although the Ministry resisted calls that the embargo be extended to some neutral countries, it was later extended to cover the whole of metropolitan France, including Algeria, Tunisia and French Morocco.UK National Archives. Minutes of Ministry of Economic Warfare Committee report, 1940 =German gains= In course of the Battle of France, the Germans captured 2,000 tanks of various types, including the heavy French Char b and British Matildas, 5,000 artillery pieces, 300,000 rifles and at least 4 million rounds of ammunition. These were all available to be reconditioned, cannibalised or stripped down for scrap by the men of Organisation Todt. Despite attempts to transport it away before capture, occupied nations' gold reserves were also looted, along with huge numbers of artworks, many of which have never been recovered. Occupied countries were subjected to relentless, systematic requisitioning of anything Germany required or desired. This began with a vast physical looting, in which trains were requisitioned to carry to Germany all movable property such as captured weaponry, machinery, books, scientific instruments, art objects and furniture. As time went on other miscellaneous items such as clothing, soap, park benches, garden tools, bed linen and doorknobs were also taken. The looted goods were taken to Germany mainly by trains, which themselves were mostly kept by Germany.TIME, 28 October 1940, Vol. XXXVI, No. 18. Immediate steps were also taken towards the appropriation of the best of the conquered nation's food. Decrees were proclaimed to force farmers to sell their animals and existing food stores, and while in the beginning a percentage of each year's crop was negotiated as part of the armistice terms, later the seizures became much more random and all-encompassing. Next, a blatantly unfair artificial exchange rate was announced (1 reichmark to 20 francs in France) and practically valueless 'Invasion Marks' brought into circulation, quickly inflating and devaluing the local currency. Later, German agents bought non- portable assets such as farms, real estate, mines, factories and corporations. The individual central banks were forced to underwrite and finance German industrial schemes, insurance transactions, gold and foreign exchange transfers etc. The Germans also gained the occupied country's natural resources and industrial capacity. In some cases these new resources were considerable, and were quickly reorganized for the Nazi war machine. The earlier acquisitions of Austria and Czechoslovakia yielded few natural resources apart from 4m annual tons of iron ore, a good proportion of Germany's need. Austria's iron and steel industry at Graz, and Czechoslovakia's heavy industry near Prague, which included the mighty Skoda munitions works at Pilsen were, though highly developed, as heavily reliant on imports of raw materials as Germany's. The conquest of Poland brought Germany half a million tons of oil per year and more zinc than it would ever need, and Luxembourg, though tiny, brought a well-organized iron and steel industry 1/7th as great as Germany's. Norway provided good stocks of chromium, aluminum, copper, nickel and 1m annual pounds of molybdenum, the chemical element used in the production of high speed steels and as a substitute for tungsten. It also allowed them to continue to ship high quality Swedish iron ore from the port of Narvik, the trade which Britain tried to prevent with Operation Wilfred. In the Netherlands, they also acquired a large, high tech tin smelter in Arnhem, though the British, foreseeing the seizure, restricted the supply of raw tin leading up to the invasion, so the amount gained was only around a sixth of a year's supply (2,500 tons) for Germany. But by far the biggest prize was France. German memories of the Versailles Treaty and of the turbulent years of reparations, food shortages and high inflation during the years immediately after World War I caused wealthy France to be treated as a vast material resource to be bled dry, and her entire economy was geared towards meeting Germany's needs. Under the armistice conditions she had to pay the billeting costs of the occupying garrison and a daily occupation indemnity of 300 to 400 million francs. The occupied zone contained France's best industries, with a fifth of the world's iron ore in Lorraine, and 6% of its steel production capacity. Germany's heavily overburdened railway network was reinforced with 4,000 French locomotives, and 300,000 (over half) of her freight cars. Unoccupied France ( Zone libre ) was left with only the rubber industries and textile factories around Lyon and its considerable reserves of bauxite, which because of the British blockade ended up in German hands anyway, giving her abundant supplies of aluminum for aircraft production. Along with the copper and tin she received from Russia, Yugoslav copper, Greek antimony and chromium and its Balkan sources, Germany now had sufficient supplies of most metals and coal. She also had around 2/3 of Europe's industrial capacity but lacked the necessary raw materials to feed the plants, many of them working at low capacity or closed because of RAF bombing, the general chaos and the flight of the populations. From the beginning of the war, Germany experienced massive labour shortages and as time went by the occupied nations labour forces were virtually enslaved, either to work in factories to supply the Reich or sent to Germany to work in the factories or farms there. In Germany herself, there was a chronic shortage of men to work the fields and 30,000 agricultural labourers were brought in from Italy along with thousands of Polish slaves. The pre-war stockpiles of goods were running down and more ersatz substitutes were being used. In addition, Germany remained cut off by the blockade from oversea supplies, such as copper from Chile, nickel from Canada, tin and rubber from the East Indies, manganese from India, tungsten from China, industrial diamonds from South Africa and cotton from Brazil. Germany's Axis partner Italy was now also subject to blockade and, heavily reliant on her for coal, became a net drain, but Hitler's main problem was oil, around 12.5m tons of which were needed per year for total war. Besides the Rumanian supply, his own synthetic industry produced 600,000 tons per year, and another 530,000 came from Poland. Russia was known to have enormous reserves of oil and gas but had chronically underdeveloped extraction systems, and though there was talk of German engineers going to reorganize them, it would take around two years before large quantities would begin flowing.TIME, 14 October 1940, Vol. XXXVI, No. 16. =Battle of Britain= Officers on the bridge of a destroyer, escorting a large convoy of ships keep a sharp look out for attacking enemy submarines during the Battle of the Atlantic in October 1941. Hitler's best chance of beating the blockade was by knocking Britain out of the war. By far Britain's best weapon was her navy, which not only enforced the blockade, but also, despite the attempts of the U-boats and aircraft, continued to largely control the seas and keep her supplied with most of her needs. Her vast empire gave her formidable resources to draw on, excellent foreign credit facilities and gold reserves, and British rationing was nowhere as severe as in Germany. The only rationing introduced immediately at the war's beginning was petrol. Bacon, butter and sugar followed on 8 January 1940, meat on 11 March, with tea and margarine in July. It was not until U-boat successes in the Battle of the Atlantic began severely restricting convoys in late 1940 that rationing became more widespread, and even then many workers and children still had school meals and work canteens to supplement their rations, which made a significant difference to the amount of food they actually received. Photographs of abundant fruit markets, butchers, fishmongers and grocers were placed in foreign publications to prove to American and Commonwealth readers that Britain was not, as the Nazis claimed, starving. Britain did rely on imports for a large proportion of its foodstuffs and, even with the widespread 'Dig for Victory' campaign and the use of women farm workers, could only produce around two-thirds of its needs. An air raid shelter in a London Underground station in London during the Blitz. Prior to the start of the Blitz (bombing of population centres), which eventually killed over 40,000 civilians but which gave British industry the breathing space it needed to provide the fighter aircraft and ammunition to hold off invasion, docks on the south coast such as Southampton, Portsmouth and Plymouth were heavily damaged by German bombing raids; in response as much maritime traffic as possible was directed to the west and north. On 16 August the Luftwaffe claimed to have destroyed Tilbury Docks and the Port of London, which normally handled a million tons of cargo per week. To the Nazis' glee, the skipper of one Brazilian freighter stated that southern Britain was finished and nothing could save her,TIME, 9 September 1940, Vol. XXXVI, No. 11. but although the damage was severe, ships from all parts of the Empire, South America and the Far East continued to unload food and war goods for Britain and to load cargoes for export. With no passenger trade, and with all Scandinavian and continental sea traffic suspended, the port was far less busy than normal, but as many as 35,000 men still filled the warehouses with grain, tobacco, flour, tea, rubber, sugar, meat, wool, timber and leather every day throughout August 1940. British aircraft factories, led by the Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook worked around the clock to greatly increase production and prevent a collapse of the RAF. On 16 September Time Magazine wrote \\"Even if Britain goes down this fall, it will not be Lord Beaverbrook's fault. If she holds out, it will be his triumph. This war is a war of machines. It will be won on the assembly line\\".TIME, 16 September 1940, Vol. XXXVI, No. 12. In an effort to force Britain into submission, the Luftwaffe concentrated its efforts on factories, ports, oil refineries and airfields. By mid-August the attacks were becoming increasingly co-ordinated and successful. On 24 August, at the height of the battle, bombers sent to attack Fighter Command installations and oil refineries on the outskirts of London killed civilians in houses in central London through a navigational error, although many believed the bombing was deliberate. In spite of opposition from the air ministry, Churchill ordered the bombing of Berlin in retaliation, and that night the German capital was bombed for the first time, although there were no fatalities. Britons were pleased as it showed Britain was able to hit back, and the next day Berliners were reported to be stunned and disillusioned; G√∂ring, who had said it would never happen, was ridiculed by both sides. When the bombing continued, the Nazi leadership ordered the Luftwaffe to begin bombing British cities on 7 September in the belief that this would damage civilian morale so much that Britain would sue for peace. The Battle of Britain raged throughout August and September 1940, but the Luftwaffe was unable to destroy the RAF to gain the air supremacy which was a prerequisite for the invasion. At night, aircraft of RAF Bomber Command and RAF Coastal Command flew the short distance across the channel and attacked the shipping and barges which were being assembled in the ports at Antwerp, Ostend, Calais and Boulogne to carry the invasion force across, eventually destroying over 20% of the fleet. Finally, on 12 October, the invasion was called off until spring 1941, although British cities, notably London, Birmingham and Liverpool continued to be heavily bombed for another 6 months. =European food shortages= Despite Germany's industrial gains, food was another matter. Even in peace, Europe was unable to feed itself, and although Germany now held two-fifths of the green fields of Europe, Germans found that despite decrees forcing farmers to sell their produce and livestock and outright requisition, in terms of food the occupied lands represented a net drain on their resources that could not be made good. While Denmark, the 'Larder of Europe', produced massive quantities of bacon, eggs and dairy products, this was heavily dependent on imports of fertilizer from Britain. Before very long, livestock was being slaughtered because of a lack of fodder ‚Äì the pigs so undernourished that they broke their legs walking to slaughter. Danish farmers paid large taxes, and merchant sailors were driven to work as labourers in Germany because of the blockade. Likewise the Netherlands, with its 2.7m cattle, 650,000 sheep, half a million pigs, and huge surplus of butter, cheese, meat, milk, margarine and vegetable oils, depended on Britain for its animal fodder. Much of the arable land had been ruined by opening the dikes during the Nazi invasion and many farmers refused to sell the Germans cattle, but soon there was such a meat shortage that the authorities had to confiscate bootlegged dog-meat sausages. Because the Germans forced Dutch fishermen to return to port before dark there was also a shortage of fish, and although Dutch overseas possessions were among the world's main providers of tobacco, it could not breach the blockade. Steel, iron and wood were so hard to obtain that the work of rebuilding Rotterdam came to a standstill. Life was particularly harsh in Poland. Cholera broke out in concentration camps, and mass public executions added to the estimated 3 million Poles already killed during the invasion. Thousands had already died of cold and from starvation during the first winter of the war and with its sugar beet, rye and wheat systematically stripped away, and with few farmers left on the land, conditions quickly grew worse. Norway, with extensive mountainous areas relied on imports for half its food and all its coal; shortages and hunger quickly affected Belgium which, despite being densely populated and producing only half its needs, was still subjected to the widespread confiscation of food. France, normally able to feed itself, now had an extra 5 million refugees from other countries to care for.TIME, 17 June 1940, Vol. XXXV, No. 25. When the Germans stripped the farms of half a million horses and mules for their army, causing a large drop in agricultural productivity, they also took 11% of remaining food stocks, a million tons. The Germans held 1,500,000 French prisoners of war as hostages, feeding them on bread and soup so thin that grass was added to bulk it up, and most items were now heavily rationed, with a worker entitled to a daily diet of only 1,200 calories; many people rode bicycles into the countryside during the weekend to scavenge for food. German soldiers got double rations, but this was still only a modest daily diet, similar to that served to inmates in American prisons. The Greek counter- offensive against the Italian attack through Albania. The British blockade of the Mediterranean immediately cut Italy off from 80% of its imports. Essential items such as pasta, flour and rice were severely rationed, leading to riots, and any farmer withholding his crops from compulsory storage could be imprisoned for a year. Following their disastrous invasion of Greece from occupied Albania on 28 October 1940, Italian reserves of rubber, cotton, wool and other commodities began to dwindle, and the high prices charged by Germany to haul coal across the Alps from Trieste made heat a luxury. On 11 November Britain scored a major victory against the Italian navy at Taranto, which secured British supply lines in the Mediterranean. Even in the normally plentiful Balkan region there were now food shortages caused by an extremely hard winter in the east and flooding of the lower Danube which devastated the agricultural plains and prevented the planting of crops. In Romania, farm hands were still mobilized into the Army and, along with Hungary and Yugoslavia, she needed all the wheat that could be produced, but the Germans made heavy demands on them, backed up by threats. Until late 1940 Hitler hoped to establish peaceful German hegemony over the Balkans as part of his supply hinterland, but after the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina from Romania in late June, his hand was forced. On 7 October Germany invaded Romania to block the Soviet Army and to get access to the Ploie»ôti oilfields. After Italy's disastrous invasion of Greece on 28 October the British intervened in accordance with the Anglo-Greek Mutual Aid Agreement, occupying Crete and establishing airfields within bombing distance of the Romanian oilfields. In late November Hungary and Romania signed the Tripartite Pact, joining the Axis powers and, although Yugoslavia initially refused to sign, Hitler now had control of the majority of the vast agricultural resources of the Great Hungarian Plain and Romanian oilfields. Britain's Bomber Command continued to attack German strategic targets, but the task of bombing Germany was made much harder by the loss of the French airfields as it meant long flights over enemy-held territory before reaching the target. But the British at this point had no effective means of taking offensive action against the enemy, and began to look towards a renewed bomber strategy. After the German devastation of Coventry, the RAF raided oil refineries in Mannheim city centre on the night of 16‚Äì17 December. This was the first 'area raid', but photography after the raid showed that most of the 300 bombers had missed the target, and that Bomber Command lacked the means of carrying out precision raids. Even so, a bombing campaign offered the only hope of damaging the German economy, and directives at the end of 1940 stated two objectives: precision attack on German production of synthetic oil, and an attack on German morale by targeting industrial sites in large cities. In December 1940 Roosevelt, having won an historic third term as president declared that the U.S. would become the \\"Arsenal of Democracy\\", providing the weapons Britain and her Commonwealth needed without entering the war herself. As 1940 drew to a close, the situation for many of Europe's 525 million people was dire. With the food supply reduced by 15% by the blockade and another 15% by poor harvests, starvation and diseases such as influenza, pneumonia, tuberculosis, typhus and cholera were a threat. Germany was forced to send 40 freight cars of emergency supplies into occupied Belgium and France, and American charities such as the Red Cross, the Aldrich Committee, and the American Friends Service Committee began gathering funds to send aid. Former president Herbert Hoover, who had done much to alleviate the hunger of European children during World War I, wrote: :The food situation in the present war is already more desperate than at the same stage in the [First] World War. ... If this war is long continued, there is but one implacable end... the greatest famine in history. =1941= From the beginning of 1941 the war moved increasingly eastwards. On 28 December 1940 Mussolini appealed for urgent German help in the Greco- Italian War. Germany was also forced to send the Afrika Korps to Libya in early February, led by General Erwin Rommel, to help its Axis partner in its North African campaigns against the British and Commonwealth forces. The Italians were also buckling under a strong British and Indian counter- offensive in Eritrea in East Africa. Because of its strategic position in the Mediterranean close to Sicily and the Axis shipping lanes, the British island of Malta also came under daily enemy bombardment in the Siege of Malta, and by the end of the year the island had suffered over 1,000 bombing attacks to force a surrender. As more U-boats entered service, the weekly toll on Allied merchant ships continued to mount, and by June eggs, cheese, jam, clothing and coal were added to the rationed list. In early January 1941 German officials announced the signing of \\"the greatest grain deal in history\\"TIME, 20 January 1941, Vol. XXXVII, No. 3. between the Soviet Union and Germany. The Soviets, who also concluded a ¬£100 million arms deal with China shortly afterwards, expected criticism from Britain and America; Izvestia newspaper declared; =Humanitarian aid in Europe= In January Herbert Hoover's National Committee on Food for the Small Democracies presented the exiled Belgian Government in London with a plan he had agreed with the German authorities to set up soup kitchens in Belgium to feed several million destitute people.TIME, 10 March 1941, Vol. XXXVII, No. 10. Under the plan, the Germans agreed to supply 1m bushels (1 US bushel = 8 US gallons, about 27 kg for wheat) of bread grains each month, and the committee was to provide 20,000 tons of fats, soup stock and children's food. However, Britain refused to allow this aid through their blockade. Their view, which many in America and the occupied countries supported, was that it was Germany's responsibility to feed and provide for the people she conquered,UK National Archives. Minutes on Commons debate, 1941 and that the plan could not avoid indirectly helping Germany; if aid were given, this would free German goods for use elsewhere. Hoover said that his information indicated that the Belgian ration was already down to 960 calories ‚Äì less than half the amount necessary to sustain life ‚Äì and that many children were already so weak they could no longer attend school, but the British disputed this. Even so, many Americans were appalled by the continuing hardship. There were 16m French Americans alone, and by early March at least 15 different organizations ‚Äì collectively known as the Coordinating Council for French Relief ‚Äì were distributing aid in France through The American Friends Service Committee, while the Quaker Committee also distributed around $50,000 worth of food, clothing and medical supplies a month throughout France. The American Red Cross chartered a 'mercy ship', SS Cold Harbor to take of evaporated and powdered milk and 150,000 articles of children's clothing, 500,000 units of insulin and 20,000 bottles of vitamins to Marseilles and shortly afterwards sent a second, the SS Exmouth, to carry $1.25m worth of relief supplies into unoccupied France. A number of prominent liberals denounced the release of food to France in a letter to United States Secretary of State Cordell Hull. Describing how French industry was working for the Germans and how Hitler had seized 1m tons of French wheat to hold in occupied France, the group believed the move would undermine the blockade and lead to Nazi demands for America to continue feeding other conquered lands. Vichy France's ambassador to the United States, Gaston Henry-Haye, continued to press for a relaxation of the blockade on humanitarian grounds, and the US government found itself in a difficult moral dilemma. The US Foreign Affairs Economist Karl Brandt described how Hitler (and Stalin) used food as a political weapon to destroy internal opposition, reward accomplishment, punish failure and smash their enemies in neutral countries.TIME, 31 March 1941, Vol. XXXVII, No. 13. He described how the 'warrior caste' were given the most, followed by essential workmen (in Berlin, William Shirer and the other foreign journalists were classed as 'heavy labourers' and received double rations) while at the bottom prisoners, Jews and the insane got the least. By this time the Nazis had begun executing otherwise healthy mental patients in German institutions, in part to save on food, and there was a clamour from family members to have their loved ones removed. Brandt said: :Supplies are suddenly cut down regardless of the amount stored to scare the population and extra rations are suddenly granted to boost morale in a bad time. Food statistics are guarded like bomber planes. To the Nazis, food is a beautiful instrument... for manoeuvring and disciplining the masses. By this time there were increasing reports of Vichy French vessels in the Mediterranean running the British blockade from North African ports and ignoring the orders of the British Contraband Control to stop and submit to search.TIME, 7 April 1941, Vol. XXXVII, No. 14. Vichy Vice-Premier Admiral Darlan declared that the Vichy merchant marine had so far brought through the blockade 7m bushels of grain, 363,000 tons of wine, 180,000 tons of peanut oil together with large amounts of fruit, sugar, cocoa, meat, fish and rum. Darlan, who during the battle of France had given Churchill the solemn pledge that the French navy would never surrender to Germany, claimed that the British were reluctant to risk a third bloody clash like those at Dakar and Oran, and that, while they had sunk seven unescorted French food ships, they had never sunk, or even stopped, a French ship escorted by warships. =Lend-Lease= President Franklin D. Roosevelt signing the lend-lease bill to give aid to the UK, China and Greece, 1941. Despite the effects of her blockade, there was no debate about America's resolve to feed Britain herself, and she was able to, with record harvests. But Britain, having already sold ¬£1 billion of her foreign investments and taken on another ¬£3 billion in loans to pay for war materials was now feeling the financial strain of the war. On 11 March 1941 Roosevelt and Congress passed into law the programme of Lend-Lease, which allowed for the sending of vast amounts of war material to Allied countries, and Churchill thanked the American nation for a 'new Magna Carta'. Although America did not enter the war for another nine months, she could no longer claim to be completely neutral and Hitler immediately ordered U-boats to attack US vessels. On 10 April the destroyer , which was picking up survivors from a Dutch freighter that had been sunk detected that a U-boat was preparing to attack, and launched depth charges to drive it away. This was the first direct action between Germany and America of World War II. The next day the US began regular patrols at sea. =Effects on South American trade= The world's blockades had a severe impact on patterns of world trade as a whole. On the outbreak of war, many South American countries expected to make big profits supplying the belligerents as in World War I.TIME, 17 February 1941, Vol. XXXVII, No. 7. Nearly all of Bolivia's copper, lead, tin and silver was exported to Europe, while Uruguay and southern Brazil supplied wool and canned and frozen beef. Argentina had 84% of the world supply of flaxseed, nearly all of which was exported, along with much of its wheat (23% of world supply), its corn (71%) and beef (50%). But with the stalemate of blockade and counter-blockade, total foreign trade actually plummeted and large surpluses piled up. In early February 1941 the main exporting Plata nations (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia) held a conference in Montevideo to discuss ways of improving trade between themselves and the rest of the continent. Apart from some Parana pine, tea and cereals, there was very little inter-Plata trade, and delegates eventually agreed a number of measures, such as easier currency exchange rules, finance for poorer nations, improved transport links between countries ‚Äì particularly those landlocked ‚Äì and lower customs barriers in order to demonstrate that they were not entirely reliant on overseas trade and American dollars to survive. In America herself, while many small businesses which relied on overseas trade were badly affected; because cheaper foreign imports were unavailable, home producers, such as the North Carolina peppermint trade and the handmade glassware industry in Maryland and Pennsylvania now had the entire domestic market to themselves. U.S. cheese- makers began producing substitutes for Norway's Gjetost, the Netherlands' Gouda and Edam, Italy's Asiago and Provolone and the blue cheeses of France and with Belgium and the Netherlands' tulip bulbs cut off, U.S. growers in Michigan, North Carolina and the Pacific Northwest were able to achieve twice the pre-war prices. Experiments also began in Alabama's state prison farm to grow Ramie, a tough, stiff fibre used in gas mantles which was no longer available from East and Southeast Asia.TIME, 9 June 1941, Vol. XXXVII, No. 23. =German invasion of the Soviet Union= For the Nazis, the capture of the Russian landmass, one-sixth of the Earth's surface or , not only provided the Lebensraum they demanded, but also provided the answer to all their raw material problems. On 22 June 1941 Germany invaded the Soviet Union in a three-pronged operation, catching the Soviets completely by surprise. They penetrated deep into Soviet territory, and within a week completed an encirclement of 300,000 Red Army troops near Minsk and Bialystok. The first territories to be conquered included the most productive. Between Baku on the Caspian Sea and Batum on the Black Sea lay the rich oilfields of Transcaucasia, while bordering Poland and Romania was the abundant 'Granary of Russia', Ukraine, about the size of France, of the most fertile agricultural land on earth. Occupying a Chernozem zone of seemingly inexhaustible thick humus, it produced 25% of Russia's wheat, and immense crops of rye, barley, oats, sugar beet, potatoes, sunflowers, flax, maize, tobacco and cotton. The Ukraine was also the main industrial region. Its Donetz Basin provided 80% of Russia's steel, 70% iron, 50% steel, 72% aluminium and 35% of the manganese, as well as being one of Europe's largest coalfields, yielding 67 million tons per year. Russia had had a reputation as a backward, agrarian country, but the communist government was well aware of the dangers of overly relying on the Ukraine and of the need to modernise its industry. The whole face of the Soviet economy was transformed from 1928 onwards by Joseph Stalin's 3 Five Year Plans, and whereas three-fourths of total industry was formerly concentrated around Moscow, St Petersburg, and Ukraine, great new industrial towns had now sprung up all over the union, some, such as Stalingorsk in west Siberia and Karaganda in Kazakhstan, in places where man had previously barely set foot. A prosperous new cotton industry was created in Turkestan, new wheat regions in the centre, east and north, coal came from Siberia, rich mineral deposits from the Urals, Siberia and Asiatic Russia, and immense new oil wells began to flow, not just in the Caucasus, but in the Urals and the Volga valley. During the first six months the Soviets were in complete disarray, and lost whole armies of men, over 70% of their tanks, a third of their combat aircraft and two-thirds of their artillery. Despite the initial defeats, the Soviets were able to relocate large sections of their industry from the main cities and Dnepr River and Donbas regions further east to the Urals and the Siberian wastes beyond, but it would take a great deal of time before they could be reassembled and production returned to normal levels. On 3 July Stalin announced a \\"scorched earth policy\\". As they retreated, everything that could not be moved east would be destroyed. Factories and oil wells were to be blown up, crops burnt and animals slaughtered so that nothing would be left for the Germans to use. =Allied aid to Soviet Union= Ice forming on a 20-inch signal projector on the cruiser whilst escorting an Arctic convoy to Russia. On 2 August 1941 the British signed the Atlantic Charter with the U.S. and extended the blockade to cover Finland, which was now fighting on the side of Germany. Churchill now embraced Soviet Union as an ally and agreed to send arms to make up the shortfall while Soviet industry reorganised itself for the fight. By mid 1942 Britain was providing Soviet Union, via the Arctic convoys with an array of vehicles, artillery and ammunition as part of the Lend Lease programme. In total Britain sent more than 4,500 Valentine, Churchill and Matilda tanks, and 4200 Hurricane and Spitfire fighter aircraft. America also provided significant support, but while Alaska, only from Asia across the Bering Strait was the obvious route for transporting Lend-Lease equipment, it was remote from Contiguous United States. A land route across the roadless expanse of Canada, long discussed, now became vital, and so on 8 March 1942 the American army began construction of the Alcan Highway, a long stretch from Dawson Creek in British Columbia, north-west through Yukon Territory to an existing road on the Canadian/Alaskan border. The highway also allowed the linking up of the Northwest Staging Route, a series of rough Canadian airstrips and radio ranging stations built to convey aircraft from Alberta and the Yukon to Soviet Union and China. In total the US provided Soviet Union with $11 billion worth of goods, including 4,800 Grant and Sherman tanks, 350,000 trucks, 50,000 jeeps, 7,300 Airacobra fighter aircraft, and 3700 light and medium bombers. The Soviets also received 2.3 million tons of steel, 230,000 tons of aluminium, 2.6 million tons of petrol, 3.8 million tons of food and huge quantities of ammunition and explosives. The German attack on Soviet Union prompted the British to attempt an increase in bombing in the belief that the fighter defences would have been thinned out. Attacks on oil targets remained a priority, and successful raids were mounted against Hamburg, Bremen and Kiel in May, with Kiel suffering almost complete production losses. Later attacks on rail transport targets in the Ruhr proved costly because a new radar chain, known as the Kammhuber Line now stretched across the approaches to the Ruhr valley to alert the night fighter defences, which remained considerable. Between May and December the RAF made 105 separate raids over Germany but were unable to make any inroads into industrial capacity and suffered heavy losses in the process. On 22 June 1941 Churchill proclaimed that Britain would bomb Germany night and day, in ever increasing numbers, but because of the size of Germany and because the fleet continued to be eroded by planes going overseas, Bomber Command remained too weak for effective attacks on the German war machine. The new directives called for attacks on rail transport in the Ruhr to disrupt German economy, but this was a stop gap policy; The planes were too small, carried too light a bomb load and navigation was also shown to be faulty. Following losses of 10% during a raid on 7 November the RAF was ordered to conserve and build up its forces for a spring offensive, by which time a new navigation aid known as GEE would be available and the Avro Lancaster heavy bomber would be entering service. Third phase Attack on Pearl Harbor. Photograph taken from a Japanese aircraft during the torpedo attack on ships moored on both sides of Ford Island shortly after the beginning of the attack. A torpedo has just hit USS West Virginia on the far side of Ford Island (center). On the morning of 7 December 1941 the Imperial Japanese Navy launched a massive pre-emptive strike against ships of the US Pacific Fleet at its base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii with simultaneous invasions of the British possessions of Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaya. The next day the war became a truly global conflict as America joined the British Empire in the war against Japan, Germany and the other Axis powers. Like Germany, Japan was heavily deficient in natural resources, and since 1931 had become increasingly nationalistic, building up her military forces and embarking upon a series of ruthless conquests in Manchuria, China and French Indochina to create an empire. Amid increasing reports of atrocities committed by her forces in these lands, such as the Nanking Massacre and the use of poison gas, world opinion turned against Japan, and from 1938 America, Britain and other countries launched trade embargoes against her to restrict supplies of the raw materials she needed to wage war, such as oil, metals and rubber. But the sanctions did not curb Japan's imperialistic mood. Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy in September 1940 and, after the US ordered a total oil embargo on all 'aggressor nations' on 1 August 1941, cutting Japan off from 90% of her oil supply, she looked to the huge reserves in the south Pacific and south east Asia, territories already largely under US, British and Dutch jurisdiction. Japan knew that she could not win a prolonged war against the 'Occidental Powers', but hoped that by striking first at Pearl Harbor to knock out the American Pacific fleet then using her huge reserves of men and machines to occupy the territories she coveted while America was still unready for war, Britain was engaged in all-out struggle with Germany and the Netherlands was herself occupied, she could establish her empire and consolidate herself so firmly that although her enemies would attempt to batter at her defensive line they would eventually be forced to accept the new position and make peace on the basis of the new status quo. In the early months of the war Japan launched a series of stunning conquests in the region, among them Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaysia, Burma and the East Indies, and soon threatened Australia far to the south. Because she was an island, the blockade of Japan was a fairly straightforward matter of sinking the transport ships used to ferry materials from the occupied lands to the home islands, and remained a largely American affair. The Japanese began with a barely adequate 6.1m merchant tons which American submarines and aircraft gradually whittled away until only 1.5m tons remained. The steady toll of attrition against her merchant marine was a major factor in Japan's eventual defeat, but the Allies agreed that the situation was far more complex with Germany, where a range of measures including strategic bombing would be required to achieve final victory. =America joins the economic war= In December 1941 the United States joined the economic warfare system that the British had created and administered over the previous two years. The Board of Economic Warfare, (BEW) which evolved from the earlier Economic Defense Board, was created by President Roosevelt on 17 December 1941. Under the chairmanship of Vice President Henry Wallace, the new department was made responsible for the procurement and production of all imported materials necessary both to the war effort and the civilian economy. The Proclaimed List ‚Äì a US equivalent to the British Statutory List ‚Äì was compiled and, under British direction, the United States Commercial Corporation was formed to begin making preclusive purchases of strategic materials such as chromium, nickel and manganese to supply future Allied needs and to prevent them from reaching the Germans.UK National Archives. Ministry of Economic Warfare minutes from May 1944. From the start there was close co-operation between the parallel American and British agencies, over economic warfare measures, intelligence gathering and the later Safehaven Program. The American Embassy in London acted as the base for the American BEW activities in Europe and was organized in March 1942, \\"to establish a more intimate liaison between the manifold economic warfare activities centered in the Ministry of Economic Warfare and comparable activities in the United States Government.\\" BEW personnel sat on the Blockade Committee on equal terms with their British counterparts, undertaking the routine work of handling Navicerts, ships permits and defining contraband. The embassy division worked with MEW in the development of new war trade agreements and the re- negotiation of existing overseas purchase ‚Äì supply contracts. Together they attempted to persuade the remaining neutrals ‚Äì Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Switzerland, Ireland (and Argentina) ‚Äì that by supplying Germany with the materials it needed they were prolonging the war, and over time a number of measures were tried to pressure these countries into reducing or ending trade with the Axis, with varying degrees of success: =Portugal= Like General Franco in Spain, Portuguese President Antonio de Oliveira Salazar was perceived as pro-Axis but walked a fine line between the two sides, who competed fiercely for Portuguese raw materials, generating huge profits for her economy. Portugal provided Germany with direct overland exports of a wide range of commodities including rice, sugar, tobacco, wheat, potassium chlorate, inflammable liquids and yellow pitch, and Portuguese merchants were also known to be sending industrial diamonds and platinum via Africa and South America. But by far the most important material Portugal had to offer was tungsten. Tungsten carbide was a critical war commodity with numerous applications such as the production of heat-resistant steel, armour plate, armour-piercing shells and high-speed cutting tools. Portugal was Europe's leading supplier of tungsten (and scheelite, another member of the wolframite series of tungsten ore minerals), annually providing Germany with at least 2,000 metric tons between 1941 and mid-1944, about 60 percent of her total requirement. Britain was Portugal's largest trading partner and had the right to force her to fight on her side under a 500-year-old alliance, but allowed her to remain neutral; in return Portugal allowed credit when Britain was short of gold and escudos, so that by 1945 Britain owed Portugal ¬£322 million. Germany was Portugal's second-largest trading partner, initially paying for exports with consumer goods, but after 1942 increasingly with looted gold, which the Allies warned was liable to confiscation after the war. Portugal also allowed Germany generous credit terms, partly because after the fall of France the presence of a direct land route enabled Germany to threaten Portugal with invasion if she curtailed critical exports. The Allies, who also bought Portuguese tungsten, believed that if they could persuade the Portuguese to stop selling the ore the German machine tool industry would very quickly be crippled and she would be unable to continue to fight. Because Portugal depended on the U.S. for petroleum, coal and chemical supplies, the Allies' economic warfare agencies considered achieving their aim by embargoes, but hesitated because they also wanted access to Portuguese military bases on the Azores. =Spain= Since before the war, pro-Nazi Spain had suffered chronic food shortages which were made worse by the blockade. The Allies used a variety of measures to keep Spain neutral, such as limiting her oil supply and making trade deals at critical times to provide her with much-needed foreign exchange to buy food from South America. On 23 November 1940 Churchill wrote to Roosevelt to inform him that the peninsula was now near starvation point, and that a US offer to provide a month by month supply of food might be decisive in keeping Spain out of the war. Spanish companies did important aircraft work for the Germans, Spanish merchants furnished Germany with industrial diamonds and platinum,U.S. National Archives. and General Franco, still loyal to Hitler because of his support during the civil war, continued to supply Germany with war materials, among them mercury and tungsten. Spain, the world's second-largest producer of tungsten after Portugal, provided Germany with 1,100 metric tons of the ore per year between 1941 and 1943 (between them Spain and Portugal provided 90% of Germany's annual 3500 tons requirement). As a result of Allied economic measures and German defeats, by 1943 Spain adopted a more genuinely neutral policy. The Allied strategy with Spain was identical to that of Portugal: buy enough tungsten to satisfy the export need and prevent the rest reaching the enemy by whatever means. Britain and the US again had the option of launching an oil embargo on Spain but hesitated for fear of forcing Franco to side with Germany militarily. =Sweden= German infantry attacking through a burning Norwegian village, April 1940. Sweden had long been Germany's main source of high quality iron ore and ball bearings, and continuation of supplies from the port of Narvik, which the British tried to stop with Operation Wilfred was one of the factors which led to the German occupation of Norway. Allied economic warfare experts believed that without the Swedish exports the war would grind to a halt, but Sweden was surrounded by Axis countries and by those occupied by them, and could have herself been occupied at any time if they failed to give Germany what she wanted. thumbleftIron ore was extracted in Kiruna and Malmberget, and taken by rail to the harbours of Lule√• and Narvik. (Borders as of 1920‚Äì1940.) The U.S. and Britain were sympathetic to Sweden's difficult position and of her attempts to maintain her neutrality and sovereignty by making important concessions to the Nazis, such as continuing to export timber and iron ore and by allowing the Germans use of their railway system, a privilege which was heavily abused. There was a general belief however, that Sweden went too far in accommodating the Nazi regime. In particular, the U.S. abhorred the use of Swedish ships to transport the ore to Germany and of her allowing Germany to transport soldiers and war materials across Sweden and through the Baltic under Swedish naval protection. Sweden received very little by way of imports due to the various blockades, and the Allies tried to use offers of a relaxation to persuade her to reduce her assistance of Germany, which they believed was actively prolonging the war. Churchill himself believed that Sweden could be instrumental in defeating Germany and after the heavy German defeats at Stalingrad and Kursk in 1943 the Russians became vocal in calling on Sweden to do more to aid the Allies. =Turkey= Despite signing a military alliance with Britain and France in October 1939, Turkey, like Sweden, Spain and Portugal spent the war keeping both sides at arm's length while continuing to supply them with their war needs. Despite the German occupation of the Balkans in spring 1941, no military action was taken against Turkey, who in October 1941 began selling Germany large quantities of chromite ore for the production of chromium. The Turkish chromite ore, which like tungsten was an irreplaceable and essential war material, was the only supply available to Germany, who paid using iron and steel products and manufactured goods in order to draw Turkey into her sphere of influence. Turkey still maintained its good relations with the US and Britain despite the trade, which the economic warfare agencies sought to minimize. Via its Commercial Corporation, the US engaged in a preclusive buying programme under British direction of its materials, particularly the chromite ore. It also bought commodities, e.g., tobacco, it did not really need, and sent Turkey's armed forces modern equipment under Lend Lease to replace obsolete equipment, to help maintain her neutrality. In so doing the Allies sought to maintain British influence in Turkey, and when the Allies decided, at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943 to attempt to persuade Turkey to enter the war against Germany, Britain was assigned the role of negotiator. Turkey eventually ended trade with Germany and declared war on her in February 1945. =Argentina= Although most South American republics were sympathetic to the Allied cause, the US State Department was frustrated by the attitude of Argentina from the very beginning. Her government refused to cooperate with US economic warfare measures or to sever financial ties with Germany, her main trading partner. Though during the war she doubled her exports of bully beef to the US and to Britain, with whom she had a history of close ties, the government was openly pro-Nazi, particularly after June 1943, and even conspired to overthrow other Latin American governments and replace them with fascist regimes. German agents were permitted to operate and spread propaganda freely and subsidiaries of IG Farben, Staudt and Co. and Siemens also operated in Argentinian territory, maintaining their links with Germany and supporting Nazi espionage operations in the region. Although the naval blockade, now heavily reinforced by US warships, restricted their efforts, merchants in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires smuggled important quantities of platinum, palladium, drugs, and other chemicals to Germany, and a major aim of the US contraband control was to use US exports to Argentina to put pressure on her government to turn away from Nazi influence and break financial ties. =Switzerland= Switzerland during World War II had the most complex relationship with Germany of all the neutral countries. Expecting hardship, the Swiss government spent heavily in the years prior to World War II on stockpiling food and buying armaments and, anticipating an invasion, kept its forces constantly mobilised. Following the Nazi conquests of mid 1940, the tiny landlocked nation of seven million people, which had remained resolutely neutral since 1815 found itself in a difficult position, with German officials controlling all gateways to the outside world. But despite veiled threats and the constantly strained relations between the two nations, Switzerland was of no strategic importance to Germany, and of far more use as a workshop. Although Swiss citizens largely rejected the Nazis and subscribed to the Internationalist view expressed by the League of Nations, in order to survive and continue to receive imports, Switzerland had little choice but to trade with Germany, for which she was paid largely in coal. Well-known companies such as Oerlikon-B√ºhrle provided guns, Autophon A.G. provided transmitting apparatus, and other companies exported coal-gas generators, ball bearings, bomb sights, ammunition, carbon black, timepieces and rayon for parachutes. Because of her geographic position and trade with Germany, Switzerland was subject to Allied blockade measures throughout, although she remained able to move imports and other exports such as sugar and benzene overland, mainly to Germany and other countries in the neutral zone. In December 1941 an attempt by the Swiss military to purchase American machine-gun cameras was blocked by Britain's refusal to grant a Navicert, and in April 1942 the US Board of Economic Warfare considered quotas for Swiss imports from overseas sources, identifying Swiss commodities which might be bargained for. Firms such as the Fischer Steel and Iron Works at Schaffhausen were added to the blacklists because of their exports, causing them to eventually curtail supply and remodel their plant. Despite the Allied sympathy with Switzerland's position, some individuals and companies actively supported the Nazi cause for financial or ideological reasons. In particular the Swiss were, and continue to be, criticised for the way they aided the shipment of Nazi funds abroad and provided banking facilities for the concealment of looted art treasures and gold, much of it stolen from Jews. In late 1943 safes at a Swiss bank at Interlaken were rented by high-ranking Germans to store funds. Later, high- ranking Nazi officials withdrew their deposits from German banks and transferred large sums to Swiss banks and to the Swedish Consulate at Karlsruhe. Italian and Swiss press reports also stated that many leading Italians banked large sums in Swiss francs in banks in Switzerland. Swiss individuals and financial institutions also acted as third-party go-betweens for transactions by others, such as for contraband shipments of cotton to Italy from the United States via a Portuguese factory, and transactions took place in Zurich which facilitated the trade of mercury between Japan and Spain. During World War II, Zurich industrialist and armaments exporter Emil Georg B√ºhrle began amassing one of the twentieth century's most important private collections of European art. However the collection of around 200 works, which includes medieval sculptures and masterpieces by C√©zanne, Renoir and van Gogh has been mired in controversy since the war because of the unclear provenance of some pieces, leading to the return of 13 paintings to the former French-Jewish owners or their families. (On 10 February 2008 the collection was subjected to what Zurich police declared to be \\"the biggest ever robbery committed in Switzerland and perhaps even Europe\\"). US files show that there was a belief that neutrals that traded with the Axis should be threatened with post-war reprisals, but although the Americans believed that the Swiss trade with Germany justified bombing her, it was also thought that her exports should be cut down without endangering the work of the Red Cross and intelligence work underway in Switzerland. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which was founded in 1863 in Geneva, did a great deal of invaluable humanitarian work, particularly in the worst-affected occupied territories, for example Greece. The children's section of the ICRC sent vitamins, medicine and milk products for children, and in 1944 it was awarded its second Nobel Peace Prize for its work. Switzerland also provided asylum for refugees and persecuted individuals such as Jews and foreign workers forced to work in Germany. Following the collapse of the Mussolini regime, thousands of escaped Allied POWs were given sanctuary and the crews of damaged Allied bombers (both sides regularly invaded Swiss airspace) returning from raids over Germany often put down in Swiss territory and were allowed refuge. Despite the German trade and various measures for food self-sufficiency, Switzerland eventually used up her food stockpiles and suffered severe shortages of fuel through lapses in the German coal supply, increasingly relying on her forests and hydroelectric power. To help keep her people supplied with imports, and despite having no shoreline, the Swiss government developed its own merchant marine, acquiring several vessels that had been impounded for smuggling or withdrawal foreign flags. The ships were based in the Rhine port of Basel, which gave access to the seaport of Rotterdam, until Allied bombing of a German dam interrupted it. =1942= At the start of 1942 the Allies were yet to achieve a major victory. February was an important month. The Germans sank 117 ships in the Atlantic during the first two months of the year, and in Russia Hitler was about to launch a huge offensive to take the Caucasus oilfields. On 9 February Albert Speer became the new head of the German Armaments Ministry. Speer was an inspired choice by Hitler, performing better than could have been expected of him, expertly organising the resources at his disposal, ensuring the speedy repair of bomb-damaged factories and pushing productivity up month after month. On 14 February the British War Cabinet took the decision to adopt area bombing as a means of undermining civilian morale and on 22 February Air Marshal Arthur Harris was appointed head of Bomber Command. The long-awaited Lancaster bomber was at last being delivered to squadrons, along with the new navigational aid GEE. The renewed campaign got under way in early March with a 'saturation raid' by 200 RAF aircraft on the Renault truck and tank works at Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris. 623 French people were killed, mostly workers who had gathered outside to cheer the accurate hits. This was followed by the first of a series of eight raids on Essen which proved a great disappointment. Despite an initial pathfinding force being sent to light up the target area with flares, only one bomb in 20 fell within five miles (8 km) of the town. On the night of 28‚Äì29 March the RAF used incendiaries for the first time to hit factories in L√ºbeck, an old town with many combustible buildings, but although the British considered it a resounding success production was back to normal a week later. More disaster followed on 17 April during a daylight 'precision' raid on the MAN diesel engine factory in Augsburg. There was little effect on production and, with no fighter cover, 7 of the 12 Lancaster bombers were lost, leading to a return to night bombing. =Thousand bomber raid= Heavy investment had been made in building up the bomber force, but faith in its potential was beginning to wane, and Harris realised a major propaganda success was vital to demonstrate his belief that bombers could be decisive in defeating the enemy. Harris began pushing for a mass raid using the magic number of 1,000 bombers, although in fact the RAF barely had that many. At last, using every plane available including trainee crews, the RAF raided Cologne on 30/31 May 1942 with over 1,000 bombers; although over half the city was destroyed and it was seen as a success, the city made a surprising recovery. RAF assaults on medium-sized industrial towns to the east of the Rhine, the Ruhr and Berlin from mid-1942 also did little to weaken Germany economically. From July the B-24 Liberator and Flying Fortress fleets of the United States Air Force (USAAF) took on the role of daytime precision bombing of German arms and communication targets. They began by raiding airfields and railway stations in France and the Netherlands and badly damaged the Heroya aluminium centre near Trondheim in Norway which produced synthetic cryolite, used in the manufacture of aluminium. From mid-November the RAF began a series of 16 massed night raids on Berlin, but though the damage was considerable, the raids were less effective than those on the Ruhr and Hamburg. Essen and Bremen also suffered 1,000 plane raids and upwards of 1,000 tons of bombs. In 1942 the RAF dropped 37,000 tons of bombs on German targets, probably three times the weight dropped on Britain in 1940 and early 1941. On 21 December 1942 the USAAF attacked the Krupp plant in Essen and, although they were unsuccessful at first, demonstrated their intention to paralyse German industry by concentrating on key sectors and persevering until lasting damage was inflicted. Another important target was ball-bearing manufacture, most of which was concentrated at Schweinfurt, which in the months to come, despite the German deployment of smoke screens, mock factories, jamming devices, searchlights and flak in the area received special attention from the USAAF; Albert Speer and Erhard Milch, the Inspector-General of the Luftwaffe, realised that from this point onwards the writing was on the wall. On 25 February 1943 the Allies began a round-the-clock strategic bombing campaign in Europe, and a few days later Bomber Command began the 5-month long Battle of the Ruhr, a massive plan to wear down Germany's industrial capacity. =Blockade runners= Once new supplies of oil, rubber, and tungsten began flowing from the newly occupied Far East, mutually beneficial barter agreements were agreed whereby the Germans would acquire these vital commodities in exchange for the precision tools, blue prints and ball bearings which Japan badly needed. There had already been some trading of silk products early in the European war. Despite the and the land barrier of Russia separating Berlin from Tokyo, by mid-1942 a system of fast blockade runners was set up, the freighters traveling non-stop without showing lights or using their radio to avoid detection. The MEW believed that the first Japanese shipment of rubber reached Germany during the summer of 1942, having initially sailed from Indo-China to West Africa. From there it was transferred to small coastal vessels and ran the blockade to French Mediterranean ports by night. The MEW became concerned at the 'steady trickle' of Japanese blockade runners reaching Europe, which one estimate put at 15 ships by the end of 1942, and on the anniversary of the German and Italian declarations of war on the US, General Tojo expressed his pleasure that Japan was able to contribute the resources captured in the South Pacific to the Axis cause. Other blockade runners were known to be arriving at the French port of Bordeaux, 70 miles inside the Gironde Estuary on the Atlantic coast. The port, also a base for German and Italian submarines, was one of the most heavily defended waterways in Europe, protected by numerous patrol boats, searchlights, shore batteries and thousands of troops. Because of its distance from the sea, a naval excursion was impossible, while the RAF believed that a bombing raid would be far too inaccurate and costly in civilian life and aircraft. The difficulty of stopping the blockade runners became known as the 'Bordeaux Problem', and eventually the British decided that a different, more espionage based approach was needed. On 7 December 1942, Combined Operations launched one of the most famous raids of the war; Operation Frankton, better known as the 'Cockleshell Heroes' mission, in an attempt to sink the ships by sending a 12-man team of Royal Marine Commandos to paddle up the Gironde in canoes to place delayed action bombs on their exposed hulls. Although the commandos displayed exceptional courage and the expedition was essentially successful in that a number of ships were damaged, only 2 men survived, including the leader, Major Herbert Hasler, who had to make their way across 80 miles of France, Spain and Gibraltar back to safety. The remaining 10 men drowned, died of exposure or were captured and interrogated by the Germans before being executed. In addition, excessive secrecy and a lack of communication between Whitehall departments meant that at exactly the same time that Operation Frankton was under way, and without their knowledge, the SOE were in the final stages of their own attempt to destroy the blockade runners by deploying a team of French agents led by Claude de Baissac, posing as painting contractors who planned to carry explosives onto the ships in their baggage. The explosions caused by the commando mission ruined the preparations of the SOE team, who might well have achieved a far more effective destruction of the blockade running vessels but for the Combined Operations raid. Even so, the combined Allied air forces and navies eventually began to track down the blockade runners. In late 1942, an 8,000-ton cargo ship was caught in the Indian Ocean, where it hoisted a neutral flag and initially gave the name of a neutral vessel but misspelled the name. When the Allied warships opened fire the crew scuttled the ship, and 78 Germans were captured. By late 1943 the Germans became so desperate for supplies of key commodities that in one incident they sent a large destroyer force out into the Bay of Biscay to protect ships bringing a cargo into Bordeaux, and lost three vessels (, and ) to Allied action (Operation Stonewall). By May 1944, 15 blockade runners had been sunk and the traffic had virtually ceased apart from submarines carrying very small cargoes. The MEW stated that 45,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of tungsten, 17,000 tons of tin and 25,000 tons of vegetable oils had been destroyed as well as important far-Eastern drugs such as quinine. The Ministry was also of the view that the strong blockade had probably prevented further large amounts from being transported. =Greek famine= The net of births and deaths in the Athens area during the period from 1936 to 1943 illustrates the severity of the famine. By early 1942, the food shortages in Greece, which had been invaded by the Germans in April 1941 along with Yugoslavia, and which was now subject to the blockade, reached the famine proportions foreseen by Hoover. With its economy and infrastructure ruined by the war with Italy, Greece was compelled to pay occupation costs and to grant Germany a 'war loan', and was subjected to the same confiscation of food and raw materials practiced elsewhere. Using its virtually worthless 'invasion marks', more than half of Greece's already inadequate wheat production was \\"sold\\" to Germany along with livestock, clothes, dried vegetables and fruit. Potatoes were fried using Greek olive oil and shipped back to Germany, and the tomato crop was hurried to scurvy-ridden German troops in Africa. One US correspondent commented; \\"Germany worked like a pack of driver ants, picking Greece clean\\",TIME, 9 February 1942, Vol. XXXIX, No. 6. but the corrupt, collaborationist government also controlled the black market in whatever food was still available, causing rampant inflation of the drachma, which saw the price of a loaf of bread, where available, reach $15. There were reports of grave-robbing by people desperate to find the money to feed their families, but in the towns there were none of the staple potatoes, figs, raisins or tomatoes available and it was not long before the population began to die in droves from hunger, cholera, typhoid and dysentery. In September 1941, the Greeks appealed for overseas aid, particularly from Turkey. An official declared \\"We are not asking for food that Turks would eat, but for food they refuse to eat.\\" Collecting the dead in the streets of Athens, first winter of Axis occupation, 1941‚Äì1942 (near Stadiou Av. between the Propylee and the National Library). Despite past enmity between the two nations, Turkey quickly responded, chartering the and, after receiving permission from the British, the ship sailed from Istanbul to Piraeus on 6 October with wheat, maize, vegetables, dried fruits and medicines. Over the next few months, the ship delivered around 6,700 tons of supplies to Greece, but foundered on rocks and sank during her fifth voyage. Despite the humanitarian efforts, by late January 1942 between 1,700 and 2,000 men, women and children were dying in Athens and Piraeus each day, and Italy, which then occupied Greece, was forced to ship 10,000 tons of grain from her meagre domestic supplies, secretly to avoid unrest from her own people. This was still not enough, and eventually international pressure forced Britain to lift its blockade for the first time. In early February, Hugh Dalton of MEW told the House of Commons that Britain and America would send 8,000 tons of wheat to Greece, although there was no guarantee that the relief supplies would find their way to the starving. Dalton said; \\"There is no guarantee, nor would we pay any attention to one given by the Germans. We are in this case running a risk in view of the appalling conditions caused by the Germans in Greece.\\" From that point on, the Greek Orthodox Church, through its charity efforts in the United States and the International Red Cross, were allowed to distribute sufficient supplies to the Greek people, though the total death toll from the famine was at least 70,000, probably much higher.UK National Archives. Ministry of Economic Warfare report By late 1942, there were claims that Germany was paying for deliveries using forged US dollars and had begun to default on its Romania trade, receiving deliveries while not supplying the much-needed machinery and war materials in return. Spanish suppliers of oranges and mandarins also refused to ship deliveries until they were paid. With the gradual turn of the war, a number of neutral countries began to take a stiffer line with Germany, in some cases refusing further credit. =1943= 1942‚Äì43 was another lean year for agriculture in France. Many fertile regions such as the Vexin, the Beauce, and the Brie suffered seriously from drought. The wheatheads were light, straw was short and hay shrivelled in the meadows, causing a lack of animal fodder. In occupied areas, the Germans confiscated 40% of the crop as soon as it became available; the authorities took 40% for the wider population, leaving the farmer with only 20%. In Normandy, Brittany and along the Channel coast, rain spoilt the potato crop and tomatoes and beans did not mature. In other provinces, e.g., Touraine and Burgundy region, the very dry weather left vegetables and even weeds cooked in the ground so people who bred rabbits for meat had to feed them with tree leaves. South of the Loire the weather was more favourable but, with the coming threat of invasion, the Germans were intent on stripping the land so the Allies would be left with nothing and be compelled to bring everything across from England. Hermann G√∂ring proclaimed in a speech that under the Nazi New Order, the Herrenvolk were entitled to deprive the occupied peoples of their food, and that whoever starved it would not be the Germans.TIME, 23 February 1942, Vol. XXXIX, No. 8. Rationing remained fierce. Even with coupons, it was impossible to acquire many items. Maximum prices were fixed for everything, but the black market pushed prices 5‚Äì15 times beyond the official tariff. Cheap restaurants in big towns served dishes comprising turnip or carrot tops made without any kind of fat, and although householders still received a fair ration of rough wine, all spirits were confiscated for industrial use. The MEW continued to receive requests for a partial relaxation of the blockade, often in the belief it would make no appreciable difference to the effect on the enemy, but the pleas were steadfastly refused. The MEW believed that any substantial or widespread relaxation of the blockade would inevitably be exploited by the enemy to his own advantage, and declared that they would \\"not give him that comfort\\". Casablanca Conference With increasing numbers of heavy Lancaster, Stirling and Halifax bombers, which could travel long distances and carry a heavy bomb load, reaching squadrons, Allied leaders increasingly put their faith in the cumulative effect of strategic bombing, but decided at the Casablanca Conference in early 1943 that, as with the British Blitz, the early attempts to disrupt the morale of the German people by saturation bombing of cities had achieved the opposite effect. RAF raids on vehicle factories in Milan, Genoa, and Turin on 2 December 1942 only served to unite the Italian population behind the Mussolini dictatorship, and the plan was dropped in favour of the 'disorganisation of German industry'. Half of German synthetic oil production came from plants in the Ruhr, areas that were highly vulnerable to area attacks, and they became the primary target of Bomber Command from 1943. Fourth phase Following the German defeats at Stalingrad and El Alamein, the war began to swing decisively the Allies' way. With the appearance of more durable destroyers and new light escort carriers which could provide convoys with constant air cover, the 'Mid-Atlantic Gap', where ships could not be provided with air cover, was closed, and from mid-1943 the U-boats were all but defeated in the Battle of the Atlantic, although Contraband Control at sea still continued. German labour shortages grew so acute that Germany relied increasingly on slave labour and demanded prior claim on all available Swiss labour. The French collaborator Pierre Laval promised to send 300,000 more workmen to Germany immediately. Sir Arthur Harris and his USAAF counterpart, Major General Ira Eaker assured Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt that Germany could be bombed out of the war by the end of 1943 on the condition that nothing was allowed to reduce the forces already allocated to the bombardment of Germany. Harris was known for his sharp tongue and lack of remorse for the German civilians being killed by the raids; one of his subordinates said of him. \\"Oh, we love him, he's so bloody inhuman.\\"TIME. 7 June 1943, Vol. XLI, No. 23. Harris believed that the only role for land forces in Europe would be to occupy the Continent after the bombing had defeated Germany. Churchill thought that the experiment of all-out bomber attack was worth trying as long as other measures were not excluded, and while the commanders of the Allied land forces and navies doubted that bombing would defeat Germany, they agreed that the raids would be useful in weakening Germany prior to the invasion of Europe. But only 10% of bombs fell close enough to their targets to be called hits, and heavily bombed installations often had to be bombed again to knock them out. However, attacks on the already strained German railway system did seriously affect military operations ‚Äì in early 1943 around 150 locomotives and many freight cars were being destroyed each month. Photograph of the breached M√∂hne Dam. On the night of 16‚Äì17 May 1943 the RAF carried out the famous Dambusters raid (Operation Chastise) to breach the Mohne, Eder and Sorpe dams which supplied the Ruhr industries with hydroelectric power and fresh water needed for the production of steel. The raid drowned 1,500 people and countless farm animals, but was not as successful as claimed; and half of the 18 bombers were shot down. On 24 July 1943 Hamburg, a major manufacturing centre for Tiger tanks and 88mm guns was virtually destroyed in Operation Gomorrah. Mass attacks a few days later left a large part of the city in ruins, reportedly killing 42,000 people. In comparison with the RAF, the US 8th Air Force was at that point still small, having dropped less than a tenth the bomb tonnage on Germany as the RAF. But it was growing fast, and had begun to achieve good results. 'Bomber' Harris had great faith in American manufacturing ability and believed that it would be the USAAF, not the RAF, who would eventually deliver the final decisive blows to the enemy. On 1 August the USAAF attacked the Romanian Ploie»ôti oilfields in Operation Tidal Wave as part of the Oil Plan to wear down Axis oil supplies. No loss of production was caused, and losses were heavy: 54 out of 177 bombers were shot down. On 14 October 1943 the 8th USAAF carried out the most successful of 16 attacks on the Schweinfurt ball-bearing works but caused only a temporary setback to production and, because the bombers had fighter escort only part of the way, losses were again heavy. This forced a rethink on the self-defending bomber formation and the curtailment of daytime attacks. In November heavy damage was caused by the USAAF to the most important industrial site in Norway, the molybdenum mine at Knaben, from Stavanger.UK National Archives 1943 A Norwegian smelting works was also destroyed by British and Norwegian commandos on 21 November 1943. =Continued German requisitions= After three years of war Britain had spent ¬£10 billion, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kingsley Wood, had to ask the House of Commons to find another ¬£1 billion to continue. USAAF airpower increased, concentrating its efforts on aircraft production and repair plants in France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. By late October 1943, the MEW believed that German productivity was down 30%,TIME, 25 October 1943, Vol. XLII, No. 17. and that half the drop had occurred in the previous six months, but the figures showed the limitations of all bombing, saturation or precision. Many of the installations that had previously been reported as wiped out continued to operate. In early November the MEW published a summary of the position in the occupied lands, giving an assessment of what the Germans were believed to have appropriated from the territories they conquered in 1940 and 1941. The report estimated that more than $12,800,000,000 had been collected from the occupied territories in occupation costs and other direct charges and continued to be collected at a yearly rate of $4,800,000,000. Poland, the country most harshly treated, had suffered the confiscation of all state properties, all central stocks of textiles, food and livestock. 9,000 factories and 60,000 commercial enterprises were taken over for exploitation, and 80% of the 1942 harvest was sent to Germany. Czechoslovakia had lost its grain, its gold reserves, mines, heavy industries and important textile industry. Her total tribute was given as $1,200,000,000. Dutch industry was by now also under complete German control. State expenditures had almost trebled to pay Germany's occupation and other costs and levies. Belgium, whose government was in exile in Britain, had its entire $260,000,000 gold reserves surrendered by the Vichy regime and by the beginning of 1943 the country's entire stock of 1,500 locomotives and 75,000 trucks had been requisitioned. In Yugoslavia, all cars were seized in 1941, and any bicycles that could be found had been taken by 1942. The country had been partitioned and had suffered, like so many others from inflation caused by the occupation mark system. In Norway the Germans requisitioned personal property right down to woollen blankets, ski trousers and windproof jackets, and in Denmark all trade and industry of consequence was now controlled by Germans.TIME, 8 November 1943, Vol. XLII, No. 19. Troops had also begun seizing furniture and household goods to be shipped back for the use of bombed-out German families. Under Albert Speer, industrial factories were being relocated to Czechoslovakia on a considerable scale, and by the end of 1943, despite a lot of damage to towns ‚Äì German figures showed that 6.9m people had been bombed out or evacuated ‚Äì output of war material was greater than ever. In October 1943 the USAAF attacked Ploie»ôti again, but according to German records total loss of petroleum to the end of 1943 had not exceeded 150,000 tons. =1944= By the beginning of 1944 it was clear that the bomber offensive had not delivered the decisive defeat that was promised, and preparations were well underway for the invasion of Europe. Spain, Portugal and Sweden came under renewed pressure to end sales of vital commodities to Germany. In January 1944 the MEW estimated that Spain was still selling Germany 100 tons of tungsten a month. The Spanish Minister for Industry and Commerce defended Spain's position, saying that Spain felt it impossible to deny Germany a commodity which had a very high value in wartime. Britain, who also made considerable purchases of Spanish tungsten, favoured a compromise that would allow Spain to maintain her German tungsten exports at the 1943 level, but the United States demanded a complete ban and the oil embargo was eventually reimposed. Spain agreed to reduce the German exports in May 1944, although the Allies discovered that she continued making clandestine shipments, transporting more than 800 tons of tungsten through to July 1944 and not finally ending the trade until the closing of the Franco-Spanish border in August 1944. Portugal also defended her right to neutral trade, fearing German reprisals such as invasion or the bombing of her cities and shipping if she ceased tungsten shipments; however the US Secretary of State Cordell Hull believed that he could have achieved the objective if he had had wholehearted British support. =Big Week= On 20 February 1944 the USAAF began Operation 'Big Week', a plan to wear down the Luftwaffe arms base to secure Allied air superiority during the invasion. For six days aircraft factories were subjected to constant pounding, with the Americans flying heavily escorted missions against airframe manufacturing and assembly plants and other targets in numerous German cities including Leipzig, Brunswick, Gotha, Regensburg, Schweinfurt, Augsburg, Stuttgart and Steyr. The RAF returned to bomb the same targets by night, and the damage was such that Milch informed Speer that the March 1944 output would be only 30% ‚Äì 40% of February's total. Albert Speer took over aircraft production and managed to perform miracles: the installations were soon back to something like normal capacity, and overall production ‚Äì including synthetic oil production ‚Äì was at an all-time high and still rising. The Luftwaffe had around 40% more aircraft than it possessed a year earlier, the construction of new tanks was sufficient to equip new divisions raised for the defence of western Europe and to make good some of the losses in the east. Although the Allies kept up the round- the-clock pressure, raiding countless lines-of-communications targets in the build-up to the invasion, they were slow to grasp what German commanders were all too aware of ‚Äì that Germany had plenty of tanks and aircraft and their real achilles heel was the oil supply. In early March the USAAF raided the Erkner ball-bearing works, scoring 75 direct hits, stopping production for some time, and commenced the \\"Plan for Completion of Combined Bomber Offensive\\". The objective now became to halve Axis oil production by attacking the Ploie»ôti oilfields and fourteen synthetic-oil plants in order to deprive Germany of the means to keep its military machines operational. On 12 May the USAAF hit East German synthetic oil plants at Leuna, B√∂hlen, Zeitz and Lutzendorf; they were so badly damaged they could supply no oil for several weeks, being hit again later that month before they returned to production. Albert Speer said later that this was a decisive turning point in the war. Meanwhile, as a result of the sustained Allied diplomatic pressure, together with the deteriorating German military position, Sweden began to reduce its trade with Germany. But a September 1943 agreement under which she agreed to end ball-bearing exports failed to include a restriction on sales of the high- quality steel used in their manufacture; this allowed the restrictions to be largely by-passed, and the agreement ultimately had little effect on the German war industry. Allied attempts to stop Turkish sales of chromium had begun to have the desired effect, however. In November 1943 Albert Speer declared that without its Turkish chromium imports, Germany's armaments manufacture would come to a halt within 10 months, and Allied threats to subject Turkey to the same economic warfare measures used against other neutrals eventually persuaded her to cease the exports to Germany by April 1944. Though Germany, with the resources of the conquered territories was still able to produce three times as much steel as Britain,UK National Archives MEW Committee report as a result of military action she was beginning to lose other sources of special metals which could not be replaced. On the eastern front, the Red Army had taken back its manganese mines at Balki, from which the Germans had been getting 200,000 of the 375,000 tons their war industry required each year. In Scandinavia, an important supply of nickel was now prevented from being delivered from Petsamo in Finland, and the mines at Knaben in Norway were no longer providing molybdenum. =Eve of Overlord= During a debate in the House of Lords about the economic war on 9 May 1944, just before D-Day, Lord Nathan told the House: :My Lords, I wish to bring to your minds an almost forgotten Ministry. Back in 1939, in the early days of the war, the Ministry of Economic Warfare was always in the headlines. Then some people thought and some people said that the war could be won by blockade alone without fighting, that Germany would suddenly collapse for lack of fuel, lack of special steels, even lack of food. In a bitter school we soon learnt differently. Even today, though Germany is extremely short of oil, she has enough for actual military operations, and her people are still reasonably well fed. But after those early days we went to the other extreme. Blockade by itself did not do the trick so we put it on one side in our minds. If the early hopes were exaggerated, we must not attenuate the actual achievements. The blockade almost certainly saved us from defeat. It quite certainly made it possible for us to win and has given us the precious time to make ready for the final blow. Some years ago an economic writer put it like this: \\"The blockade won't make Germany crack, but it will make her brittle.\\" Now she is brittle, our armies can crack her. The blockade is more important now at the climax, on the eve of invasion, when the strain is telling, than ever before. The famished people of Europe must now look to the onward sweep of our advancing Armies coming as liberators and bringing bread in their train. Lord Selbourne told the house that the effect of the blockade, which may have been slight at first, had been cumulative, and Germany's greatest lack was now in manpower. While Britain was herself importing tens of millions of tons of supplies per year, the enemy was increasingly forced to use ersatz industries. German civilian motor traffic had practically entirely gone over to producer- gas, which like all ersatz materials was grossly wasteful in manpower, and this, combined with her colossal losses in the field and the need to keep a disproportionately high percentage of its available labour on the land, had produced an acute manpower crisis requiring the use of some seven million foreign slaves in Germany alone. In June 1944 the British finally secured access to the naval bases on the Azores, and the Allies thereafter threatened Portugal with economic sanctions. In turn, Portugal imposed a complete embargo on all tungsten exports to both sides, leaving Germany with only its small supply from Spain, while the Allies had alternative sources in the Far East and South America. =D-Day= As D-Day approached, the Allies prioritised attacks on Ploie»ôti and the artificial fuel sites. German air defences could no longer protect the installations, and on 12 and 20 June the RAF attacked the Ruhr hydrogenation plants and put the eastern plants completely out of action, causing a rapid drop in production; Speer predicted disaster by September if the situation did not improve. From the beginning of Overlord on 6 June, the Allies enjoyed complete control of the skies over the beachhead, and were able to transport adequate oil across the sea via tanker and use of the PLUTO underwater pipeline, while the artificial Mulberry jetties and the capture of small harbours initially enabled them to bring enough ammunition and food supplies ashore. Underground factory in Walpersberg at Kahla in Thuringia for Me 262s. The German armies defending Normandy were badly restricted by their inability to bring up adequate fuel for their tanks and could only make troop and supply movements at night. They were also forbidden by Hitler from withdrawing to better positions a few miles inland, and as a result suffered a relentless barrage of heavy calibre gunfire from British and American battleships moored offshore. German commanders increasingly put their faith in the new Messerschmitt 262 jet fighter and the V-weapons to turn the tide. The first V1 flying bomb was launched against England on 13 June 1944, and soon 120 V1s per day were being fired at London, killing large numbers of civilians. By the end of June over 2,000 V1s had been launched; 40% of bomber resources were being redirected towards 'Crossbow' targets in the hope of destroying the 70‚Äì80 launch sites north and east of the Seine. =Allied supply problems= Red Ball Express ‚Äì Truck in the mud. After the initial success of D-Day and the breakout from the Normandy beachhead which followed, the advance began to slow due to the constant difficulties of keeping the vast armies supplied. The problem was not getting supplies to the continent, but getting them to forward troops, which might be from supply depots. Each division required 600‚Äì700 tons of supplies per day while artillery and mortars used 8 million rounds per month. The speed of advance often meant there was no time to build up an orderly logistical structure and, despite the use of a truck system called the Red Ball Express, for 5 days at the end of August virtually the entire American and British advance came to a complete halt due to a lack of fuel. The supply problem was worsened by the Allies' failure to capture a deep-water port able to unload large ships. The Germans, employing their scorched-earth policy, destroyed all dock facilities as they withdrew from the occupied territories in order to deprive the Allies of any logistical advantages. By early September the only remaining undamaged deep-water port was Antwerp in Belgium, and the SOE, under the direction of the Ministry of Economic Warfare (MEW) was given the task of ensuring it was captured intact. The operation, known as Counterscorch, involved sending radio operators into Belgium to liaise with the resistance, keeping them informed of Allied movements and supplying them with weapons and ammunition. At the allotted moment the resistance seized the port, keeping the Germans out until the Allies arrived, and Belgium was liberated in less than a week, although the port of Antwerp itself was not fully operational and capable of landing large cargoes until after the Battle of the Scheldt in late November. The supply problems also led to disagreements, as each commander pressed for his unit to be given priority. The supreme commander of Allied forces, U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower wanted to advance on a broad front to overcome the West Wall (Siegfried Line), but instead accepted British General Bernard Montgomery's Operation Market Garden, the plan to try to outflank the West Wall and drive into northern Germany to encircle the industrial Ruhr via the Netherlands. Market Garden was a disaster and did not achieve its main objective, while its few territorial gains actually stretched the supply lines even further. =Loss of Balkan ores= By early October the European military and political position had changed enormously and the MEW provided a statement of Germany's deteriorating position.UK National Archives, October 1944 As a result of military operations in Lorraine and Luxembourg, the withdrawal of Swedish ships from trade with German ports, the closing of Swedish Baltic ports to German shipping, and the loss of supplies from Spain, it was estimated that iron ore supplies had been reduced by 65 per cent compared with 1943. In addition, about 45% of pig iron manufacturing had been lost, together with 40% of steel furnace capacity. Supplies of copper from Turkey and Spain had been cut off, and the Germans had lost contact with sources of copper ores at Bor in Yugoslavia and Outokumpu in Finland. Loss of the Yugoslavian and other Balkan mines took away the last supplies of chromium and reduced the supply of lead by approximately 40 per cent ‚Äì the position being worsened by the loss of substantial amounts of scrap which were collected in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. With the loss of high-grade French deposits and the seizure by Marshal Josip Broz Tito's forces of the island fringe of Yugoslavia, Germany's total loss of bauxite was put at around 50 per cent, while the loss of shipments of cobalt from Finland was around 80 per cent of the total quantity with which Germany sustained that part of her synthetic oil production obtained by the Fischer-Tropsch process. =Dutch rail strike= Operation Manna ‚Äì Many Thanks in Tulips. Meanwhile, in an attempt to assist the Allies in their liberation of the Netherlands, the exiled Dutch government called for a national rail strike to further disrupt German operations. The German authorities retaliated by placing an embargo on supplies of food into the western parts of the country. This caused severe hardship. By the time the embargo ended in November 1944 an unusually early and harsh winter had set in, leading to the Dutch famine of 1944. In the Balkans, the Ploie»ôti oilfields were lost to Germany as an oil source from August 1944, and various opposing paramilitary groups and partisans united behind Marshal Tito. With Soviet help they began pushing Axis forces beyond Yugoslav borders, leading to further German losses of food and metals. =End of Swedish trade with Germany= In August 1944 Sweden determined that the danger to its merchant and naval vessels engaged in the iron ore trade to Germany had become too great,TIME, 28 August 1944, Vol. XLIV, No. 9. and ceased exports in exchange for permission to import some of her own stores of cotton and wool shut off by the Allied blockade. In November all Swedish trade with Germany officially ended. After six months of negotiations, Switzerland also agreed to trim by one third her $60m yearly sales of machine goods and precision instruments to Germany and to cut sales of ball bearings to 10% and ammunition to 5% of the 1942 total. By this time, attacks on German fuel installations had been so successful that September's output was 8% that of April, and supplies were soon exhausted, just when fighter production reached its highest level. Allied air commanders next began targeting German transport networks. On 24 September the RAF breached the Dortmund‚ÄìEms Canal ‚Äì an inland waterway linking the Ruhr with other areas ‚Äì with Tallboy bombs, draining a six-mile (10 km) section. The enormous rail marshalling yard at Hamm was badly hit, leaving some 9,000 workers permanently engaged carrying out running repairs. On 12 November the battleship Tirpitz was sunk by RAF Tallboy bombs near Troms√∏, Norway. The ship, known as the 'Lonely Queen of the North' had seen little action through lack of fuel, and spent much of the war moored in a remote fjord. Around this time the RAF began reducing its attacks on synthetic oil production sites because none of the plants were now operating. Only the sites at Leuna and Polotz were still producing any oil, and though in December limited production restarted, further raids quickly put them out of action for good. Once the oil sites were bombed out in late 1944, transport became the primary target. Allied air power was now unstoppable. In late 1944 the German army launched the Ardennes Offensive, an attempt to split the Allied army, recapture Antwerp and force a negotiated peace. Despite early success, caused in part by severe Allied supply shortages, particularly of fuel, the operation eventually petered out. This was the last serious attempt by the German army to regain the initiative on land, although the Luftwaffe launched one final offensive with 800 aircraft against Allied airfields in Belgium, the Netherlands and France early in 1945. =1945= At the start of the war Germany's transport system, comprising modern autobahns, excellent railways and a complex network of interlinking canals and rivers was among the best in the world. But after autumn 1943 the connections between industrial centres made attractive bomber targets which when effectively bombed badly affected the distribution of coal, which formed the basis of most military and industrial operations. Soon large parts of Germany's remaining transport network were paralysed, and the Ruhr became economically isolated from the rest of the Reich. Ultimately it was the sustained Allied bombing of the transport network which broke Nazi resistance. Despite his incredible efforts at continually reorganising production after each setback, from early 1945 Speer admitted defeat in the armaments battle. German industry was now unable to keep up with the high number of 'Top Priority' weapons programmes, such as the production of the V weapons and calls for 3,000 Me 262 jet fighters and bombers per month. However, many factories maintained production right up to the moment Allied forces arrived at the gates. By now the V1 and V2 launch sites were being increasingly overrun, and with the Allies moving towards the Rhine and the Soviet armies rapidly closing in from the east, large numbers of refugees began to congregate in the cities, creating utter chaos. When severe frost and snow came in January, food was declared the main priority, although Germany still maintained the ability to defend its vital installations with formidable numbers of anti-aircraft cannons. From early February 1945 railheads, marshalling yards and transport systems of over 200 small towns, such as Hildesheim and Meiningen in West Germany and Jenbach in Austria were attacked in Operation Clarion. =Safehaven Program= With the war all but won, there were increasing reports ‚Äì mostly based on paranoia and hearsay ‚Äì that Nazi leaders were preparing to escape justiceUK National Archives. and were already preparing the way for the next war by secreting funds in neutral nations and moving resources abroad. From late 1944 onwards there were reports that rich German and Austrian Jews were being allowed to leave the Reich after paying special taxes and surrendering all their belongings to the Nazis. In December 1944 Allied intelligence sources indicated that German firms such as Schering, IG Farben, Bosch and Mannesmann Rohrenwerke were attempting to sell patents to Swedish firms, and large chemical and electrical trusts, particularly IG Farben, were procuring foreign currency to finance Nazi activities abroad. In February 1945 food supplies were reported as being collected in the Austrian and Bavarian Alps for Nazi fortresses and underground factories, and plans were apparently under way for the structural reorganization of the Nazi Party abroad by transferring money into agents' accounts in neutral countries. The Americans had information on a Fritz Mandl, a German national resident in Argentina who in January 1945 was sent several million pesos through the State Bank of Spain to invest for G√∂ring, Goebbels, and Himmler. By June 1945 German inventions were said to be in the safekeeping of the Swedish Aniline Company, with patents having been thrown onto the market through Swedish \\"dummy\\" intermediaries, and detailed information had been gathered on the financial backgrounds of a number of chemical, carbide and dye companies thought to be active as safe havens for Nazi property. The US-led Safehaven Program was launched during the United Nations Conference at Bretton Woods in July 1944, the same venue that prepared the ground for the modern World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). The program provided for immediate measures to prevent any disposition, transfer, or concealment of looted gold or other assets, to deny any safe haven for Nazi looted assets in neutral countries, and for the eventual return of looted artefacts to their original owners. Most neutrals were eventually persuaded to reduce and end trade with Germany. The Swedish Government adopted tightened exchange control regulations in November 1944 and made great progress in identifying German properties and eliminating German influences from its economy. However, negotiations for the return of looted gold allegedly sent to Sweden by Germany as payment for goods dragged on for many years. Allied estimates of the value of looted gold ranged between $18.5 million and $22.7 million, but although the British, US and French agreed that Sweden's gold reserves had increased during the war, they were unable to agree how much ‚Äì if any ‚Äì of these rises were due to looted gold. Sweden eventually agreed to distribute more than $66 million in liquidated German assets as reparations, including a special $36 million fund at the Riksbank to forestall disease and unrest in Germany and to finance purchases essential for the German economy. It also agreed to provide more than $8 million in gold to make up for that amount of Belgian monetary gold sold to Sweden during the War, but negotiations regarding 8,600 kilograms of Dutch gold ($9.7 million) stalled when Sweden argued that the gold had been acquired before the January 1943 London Declaration on looted gold. In April 1955 the Dutch claim was finally proved conclusive, and Sweden returned about $6.8 million in gold. Spain acquired a large quantity of gold from Germany, in some cases via Swiss intermediary companies, and negotiations coincided with Allied efforts to ostracize the Franco regime. A number of other countries also downgraded their diplomatic relations with Spain for having openly supported Hitler, and Spain agreed to return an estimated $25 million in official and semi-official German assets in October 1946. Spain agreed to liquidate some $20‚Äì23 million of private German assets on the understanding she would keep around a quarter of the proceeds, and signed an agreement in May 1946 to return $114,329 (101.6 kilograms) out of about $30 million in looted Dutch gold that the Allies had identified at the Spanish Foreign Exchange Institute. The Allies publicly acknowledged that Spain had not been aware it was looted, and later Spain returned $1.3 million in gold bars and gold coins it had seized from German State properties at the end of the War. Negotiations continued, but with the coming of the Cold War the US softened its approach and released over $64 million in assets frozen since the war, and allowed Spain to use its remaining gold as collateral for private loans. Because of its close financial ties with Germany, Allied representatives were especially keen to achieve Swiss co-operation. Although Swiss-German trade was generally considered to have ceased after November 1944, some companies, such as the Tavaro Munitions factory at Geneva, Switzerland, clandestinely shipped explosives to Germany, and German assets amounting to one billion francs still remained in Switzerland after November 1945. According to Under-Secretary of State Dean Acheson, Switzerland was the last country to fully commit to the aims of Safehaven. In February 1945, an American delegation sent to Switzerland initially thought it had achieved a substantial reduction in Swiss exports to Germany and an acknowledgment of Safehaven objectives for the blocking of German assets in Switzerland. But following subsequent discussions with Reichsbank Vice President Emil Puhl, the Swiss later reneged on this agreement, and through the remainder of 1945 showed an unwillingness to embrace the Allied proposals to turn German assets in Switzerland towards the benefit of ravaged Europe and stateless victims of the Holocaust and other Nazi crimes. However, because of its excellent humanitarian record and protection of Allied POWs and other interests, the Allies ultimately decided against taking extreme measures against Switzerland. Post-war Following the end of the war in Europe in late May 1945, large parts of Europe lay completely smashed. Acute food, housing and medical shortages continued for some time and around 10 million refugees housed in temporary encampments or on the roads. In the two emerging superpowers, Russia and America, post-war productivity rose remarkably by 1948, although the reasons were very different. In Russia, great stimulus was given to emerging industries as a result of frenzied war production, helped in part by advanced industrial plants it took from East Germany after the occupation. America meanwhile, had been under severe depression in 1938, with vast industrial resources lying idle and 20% of the population unemployed. Rearmament, and later war brought these resources to life, which combined with rising investment and an intact infrastructure kept American industry buoyant, although considerable residual unemployment remained. Much the same situation existed in Canada, whose economy was closely tied to America, and who also suffered no fighting within its territory. The war changed the pattern of the international economy, leaving the US in a very strong bargaining position, having managed to free up international trade to its benefit as a consequence of Lend‚ÄìLease, and forcing the British to agree to currency convertibility. Britain's economy was badly hit by the abrupt ending of Lend-Lease a few days after the final defeat of Japan in August 1945. During the war Britain lost many of its lucrative export markets and now confronted an annual balance of payments deficit of ¬£1.2billion. As in World War I, Britain emerged from the war militarily triumphant but economically poorer (rationing did not end until 1953), and economist John Maynard Keynes was sent to America to negotiate a low-interest emergency loan of ¬£3.75 billion to tide Britain over; the final repayment of ¬£45.5m (then about $83m) was made on 31 December 2006. In the former occupied countries, severe inflation ‚Äì caused in part by the large amount of money hoarded during the war, particularly by collaborators ‚Äì caused further spiralling food prices and a persisting black market. A factor aggravating inflation was low productivity, caused in part by a lack of coal. France assumed it would become entitled to large volumes of German coal from the Ruhr as war reparations, but the Americans, who kept France and other countries going with a number of short-term loans and Marshall Aid, began to realise ‚Äì correctly ‚Äì that Europe needed the powerhouse German economy to restart growth and prevent the spread of communism, and refused to agree to reparations, the very thing which led to German resentment after World War I and the rise of Hitler. In Germany herself, the people were left to start again from almost nothing, partitioned into zones which became east and west Germany for many years by the Allied powers, a time sometimes referred to as Hour Zero. Although they faced a massive task, with whole cities to be rebuilt and industries reorganised to peaceful production, within a few years the West German economy achieved a miraculous turn-around, and by 1950 a Wirtschaftswunder (economic miracle) was being proclaimed.The Times newspaper, London, UK. From 1951 onwards, France, West Germany, Italy and the Benelux nations began moves towards the unification of Western Europe with the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the forerunner to the Modern European Union. The ECSC created a common market to co-ordinate the supply of critical commodities to get the wheels of European commerce moving again. The German synthetic-oil programme was so successful and advanced that during the world fuel crisis of the 1970s, caused by conflict and uncertainty in the Middle East, large American industrial concerns such as Dow Chemical, Union Carbide and Diamond Shamrock began to reconsider the Nazi-era technology to see if it might provide a partial solution to their problems.TIME, 18 April 1977, Vol. 109, No. 16. Some 300,000 documents relating to the history of the programme, including plant diagrams, patent descriptions, detailed reports on which catalysts and additives worked best, and monthly reports from the 25 oil from coal plants had fallen into American hands at the end of the war. At the time, crude oil was readily available at $2 per barrel, a fifth of the cost of man-made oil, and there was very little interest in the German documents. They remained in boxed storage at the National Archives in Washington for the next 30 years until chemical engineers began the arduous task of collating all the information and feeding it into a computer at the federally run Oak Ridge Energy Center. Although the US managed to secure alternative non-Arabian oil supplies ‚Äì mainly from Venezuela ‚Äì synthetic oils are widely used today, mainly in specialised areas such as the airline industry and as lubricants. Media representation During the early months of the war ‚Äì the so-called phoney war or Sitzkrieg ‚Äì the activities of the men of Contraband Control were very newsworthy and provided good morale-boosting propaganda. Along with real- life accounts of German attacks on civilian fishing trawlers, news of attempts to defeat the magnetic mine, and official statistics of the monthly totals of seized cargoes, popular titles such as War Illustrated, Picture Post and the American magazine Life served up a weekly diet of photographs and patriotic accounts of the latest British or French war successes, often with captions such as The blockade became part of people's everyday lives, and it was inevitable that this would eventually be reflected in film. Directed by Michael Powell, written by Emeric Pressburger and starring Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson, Contraband (renamed Blackout in the US) was released in May 1940, just before the start of the German attack on France. In much the same style as The 39 Steps, the film centres on the fictitious port of Eastgate (filmed in Ramsgate) where Captain Anderson, a Danish merchant skipper is delayed by the men of the Contraband Control and encounters various enemy spies. It features the classic line \\"Stop that man and woman! His mission is deadlier than that of the enemy in the sky. Her beauty is a dangerous weapon of war!\\" Contraband was also Deborah Kerr's first film, though her scene as a nightclub cigarette girl did not make the final cut. An earlier silent film of the same name had been made in 1925, centred around similar events from World War I. The Big Blockade was written and directed by Charles Frend and made by Ealing Studios in collaboration with the Ministry of Economic Welfare. It was made in 1942 in a similar episodic manner to David Lean and No√´l Coward's In Which We Serve, but featuring gentle light-hearted propaganda, with a series of sketches designed to illustrate how the British blockade was gradually squeezing the life out of the Nazi war effort. The Big Blockade starred John Mills as 'Tom', a member of a bomber crew over Hanover, Leslie Banks as an efficient Ministry of Economic Warfare civil servant, Robert Morley as the Nazi U-boat Captain Von Geiselbrecht, Michael Redgrave as a Russian based in Germany, and various others, such as Will Hay, Ronald Shiner, and Bernard Miles in bit parts.

Built as an inn and tavern around 1770 in the Georgian architectural style in red brick with white wood trim by Henry Fite (1722‚Äì1789), the building became known as \\"Congress Hall\\" when it briefly served as the new nation's seat of government in 1776‚Äì77. Later, following the Revolutionary War, it became known locally as \\"Old Congress Hall\\". The structure was destroyed during the February 7‚Äì8, 1904 Great Baltimore Fire, which started nearby. Nation's capital The Second Continental Congress moved from Philadelphia to Baltimore in the winter of 1776 to avoid capture by British forces, who were advancing on Philadelphia, the new American capital city, during the New York and New Jersey campaign. As the largest building then in forty-seven-year-old Baltimore Town, Henry Fite's six year old tavern provided a comfortable location of sufficient size for the Congress to meet; its site at the western edge of town was beyond easy reach of the British Royal Navy's ships and artillery should they try to sail up the Harbor and the Patapsco River to shell the town. A visitor described the tavern as a \\"three-story and attic brick house, of about 92 feet front on Market Street, by about 50 or 55 feet depth on the side streets, with cellar under the whole; having 14 rooms, exclusive of kitchen, wash-house and other out-buildings, including a stable for 30 horses.\\" Thus, Baltimore became the nation's capital for a two-month period. While meeting here in Maryland on December 27, 1776, the Continental Congress conferred upon General George Washington, (1732‚Äì1799), \\"extraordinary powers for the conduct of the Revolutionary War,\\" a stirring vote of confidence, now a year and-a-half after having commissioned him as head of the newly organized Continental Army, following a series of defeats and retreats since the Virginian assumed command in June 1775, when the Army recruited from local militia surrounded the British in a siege at Boston after the opening skirmishes in April at Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts followed by the June British attack at Breed's and Bunker Hills across the Charles River from Boston. In her 1907 biography of the Fite family, descendant Elizabeth Fite corrected earlier historians who mistakenly reported Jacob Fite as the owner of the house. She explained that while Henry's son, Jacob, lived in the house, he was a child when the building was occupied by Congress and never actually owned the building. After Henry died on October 25, 1789, his estate was distributed among his seven surviving children; the \\"Henry Fite House\\" became the property of his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, and her husband, George Reinicker. George Peabody Philanthropist and international financier George Peabody (1795‚Äì1869), of South Danvers (later Peabody), Massachusetts and New York City, moved to Baltimore in 1816. The \\"Henry Fite House\\" served as his home and office during the next 20 years in the 1820s and 30s, where he directed his growing wide-ranging business, financial and investment empire, which by mid-century had made him the richest man in America. He later endowed the Peabody Institute in 1857, which opened nine years later with the adjoining Library in 1878. Along with the additional educational, cultural and civic programs in the mid-1860s, the Institute and Conservatory were to be built across from the Washington Monument on the Circle at North Charles and East Monument Streets (also known as Washington Place and Mount Vernon Place) in the northern city neighborhood of Mount Vernon-Belvedere formerly known as \\"Howard's Woods\\" on the \\"Belvidere\\" estate and mansion of Revolutionary War commander of the Maryland Line in the Continental Army, Col. John Eager Howard (1752-1827) who donated the land. Later during the decades following his 1827 death, his sons and family cut up and divided the estate building large elaborate substantial townhouses on a grid of streets including Peabody's Institute added north of original colonial era in Baltimore Town. Peabody left Baltimore for New York City and later London in 1837, as more and more of his international financial and business affairs consumed his time. His most famous return to the city was in 1866 (three years before his death) to address the large crowd of Baltimoreans including Baltimore City Public School children gathered on the front steps of his new Institute when it was finally dedicated in an elaborate ceremony after a long interval, interrupted by the Civil War. Royal Farms Arena The former location of the \\"Henry Fite House\\" is currently occupied by the Royal Farms Arena, originally known as the Baltimore Civic Center and from 2003-2013 1st Mariner Arena. Built in 1961‚Äì62 in the western downtown area, with a civic auditorium, arena, convention hall and exhibition galleries, the building became a center of Baltimore's sports and entertainment life. It covers the city block bounded by West Baltimore Street (north), Hopkins Place (east), Howard Street (west) and West Lombard Street (south). Memorial tablet The Maryland Society of the Sons of the American Revolution placed a large, elaborate, polished bronze memorial tablet in front of the \\"Henry Fite House\\" on February 22, 1894, describing the building's brief service to the nation. An inscription on the tablet proclaimed to visitors: \\"On this site stood Old Congress Hall, in which the Continental Congress met\\". Ten years later, only the memorial tablet remained on the corner of the smoking ruins after the Great Fire on February 7‚Äì8, 1904, which devastated most of downtown Baltimore and the waterfront. When the Civic Center (now the Royal Farms Arena) was built on the site, the bronze tablet of 1894 was preserved and mounted on the outside wall facing Hopkins Place, near the northeast corner of the building. During a later remodel, the plaque was moved inside the new glass-enclosed lobby.

Kessler in response to the need to provide educational continuity for the children of German-speaking executives based in the Tri-State area of New York, Connecticut and New Jersey.

In 1978, Mr. Kessler, former president of Carl Zeiss AG, founded a non-profit organization called the \\"German Forum\\".The German Forum The organization's prime goal was to found a school offering German-speaking children an education that would be recognized in their home countries. Kessler's hope was that the institution would be \\"one that would contribute to improving relations between nations.\\"German Outpost Of Education - Page 3 - New York Times The school officially opened on September 8, 1980. On September 23, 1980, Germany's Vice- Chancellor and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hans Dietrich Genscher, led the dedication ceremony. Speaking as the designated representative of the Federal Republic of Germany, he affirmed that the school would primarily provide German-speaking children with an education that would be recognized in their home countries. He also emphasized, however, that the school should not isolate itself, but should integrate into its surroundings and incorporate its American context into its own activities and perspectives. This way, the school would become a bridge and meeting point between Germans and Americans. =Expansion and Enhancement= Beginning with the purchase of its existing school building in White Plains, NY in 1982, GISNY has undergone several changes. To accommodate more students of different age groups, an Upper School was added to the Lower School. The first high school graduation took place on May 15, 1989. By the school's 30th anniversary in 2010, the student body had increased to 350 with a faculty of over 40 teachers. The period between 1997 and 2001 saw the largest of many improvements to the school's facilities with the construction of a state-of-the-art gym complete with a professional rock- climbing wall. In September 2010, the school completed the installment of solar panels on the gym's roof as part of an ongoing effort to reduce its ecological footprint. Today, the solar panels generate, on average, 20% of the school's electricity. There have also been changes to the school's educational program, including the introduction of the twelve-year curriculum, the German International Abitur (Deutsches Internationales Abitur - DIA) (the class of 2017 will be the first to receive this diploma), and more recently a Pre- Kindergarten program for three- and four-year-olds (September 2014). At the Annual Meeting of Members in November 2013, the Corporation approved a proposal to change the name of the school from German School New York to German International School New York, or GISNY for short. The name change became official on September 2, 2014 at a ceremony attended by White Plains Mayor Thomas Roach and German Consul General Brita Wagener.  Academics  right =Lower School= In first through fourth grades, students learn to read fluently and to express themselves clearly in both written and spoken German and English. To establish a solid foundation for the academic rigors of the International Abitur curriculum in the Middle and Upper Schools, most subjects are taught in German. However, all students receive daily individualized English instruction taught by native English-speaking teachers. For students for whom German is not their first language, the school provides German as a Second Language (GSL) support during the school day as well as an optional after-school class. =Middle and Upper Schools= As GISNY students transition from the Lower School to the Middle and Upper Schools, they are welcomed into a new world of challenging academic instruction. In addition to languages, students receive intensive instruction in math, sciences (physics, chemistry, biology), history and social studies (both European and American), economics, geography, art and music. The rigorous International Abitur curriculum, recognized globally for its depth and breadth ‚Äì for example, GISNY students begin studying biology in 5th grade, physics in 7th grade and chemistry in 8th grade ‚Äì prepares students for the world's most selective colleges and universities. GISNY employs highly qualified faculty from the US, Germany, Switzerland and Austria, 90% of whom hold an advanced degree and are considered highly trained experts in their fields. Languages In our Middle and Upper Schools, students take English every year. The English Department offers differentiated instruction based on a student's level of English fluency. Students in Advanced English (native speakers and those who wish to attend a US university) and those taking English elective courses receive instruction from veteran native English-speaking teachers. For students who are less familiar with English, GISNY also offers English as a Second Language (ESL). In addition to German and English, students add either French or Spanish beginning in 6th grade, and as of 10th grade may choose to add the other language in lieu of physics. Additionally, Latin is offered as an elective course beginning in 7th grade. The Bilingual Curriculum Beginning in 5th grade, geography, biology and physical education are taught in both German and English. Music theory and visual arts courses are taught increasingly in English from 5th through 9th grades and exclusively in English from 10th grade on. Also taught in English are American History, which begins in 8th grade, and economics, which begins in 10th grade. The German International Abitur (Deutsches Internationales Abitur - DIA) GISNY confers upon its graduates both the New York State high school diploma and the German International Abitur, known in German as the Deutsche Internationale Abitur, or DIA. The DIA grants students the possibility of attending competitive colleges and universities through the United States, Canada, Great Britain and Europe, providing them with truly global options. The program leading to the International Abitur at GISNY includes the following subjects:Deutsche Schule New York - About our School * German language and literature * English language and literature * European history * American studies/Politics * French language and literature * Spanish language and literature * Latin [optional] * Mathematics * Biology * Chemistry * Physics * Music theory and history * Art studio and history * Physical Education  School Traditions and Clubs Students, faculty and parents take part in several events throughout the school year, such as the participation in the German-American Steuben Parade along Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, as well as the annual Weihnachtsbasar (holiday event) and sporting events. The GISNY literary week also takes place every year, welcoming prominent German and/or American authors and writers to the school. The GISNY is partnered with the Westchester Holocaust and Human Rights Education Center, allowing students to participate in political events and debates with surrounding schools. In addition, the school shares ties with the Alexander von Humboldt German International School of Montr√©al, Canada, the German School Washington, D.C. and the Colegio Humboldt in San Jos√©, Costa Rica, allowing numerous programs between schools.http://dsny.org/RelId/606471/ISvars/default/School_Profile.htm GISNY students are encouraged to participate in school clubs, such as the German School Literary Magazine, Yearbook Club, Human Rights and Environment Club, Biology Club, Model United Nations, Mock Trial, Theater Club, School Choir, Glee Club, School Band, School Orchestra and the Home Economics Club. Students may also choose to additionally take part in various athletics such as Soccer, Basketball, Volleyball, Track and Field, Cross Country, Badminton and Tennis.http://dsny.org/Customized/uploads/Schulleben/AGs%20-%201.%20Hj2011.pdf German Language School at GISNY For over 20 years, GISNY has been home to the German Language School (German: Deutsche Sprachschule), giving students outside the GISNY the opportunity to learn and practice their German language skills in a cultural and international environment.

Memoirs of a Boffin , Chapter 8: Multinational, 1995 In 1957, St Paul's Operatic Society was formed. Its first Music Director was Arthur Gough, the church organist, and the first Stage Director was Doris Hemingway, formerly of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.Stone, David. \\"Doris Hemingway\\", Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, September 1, 2014, accessed September 16, 2016 She and her husband, music director Harry Norris, a former D'Oyly Carte conductor, were already well known to Montreal Gilbert and Sullivan audiences through their association with the Lyric Opera Company, Montreal West Operatic Society and various other musical groups. In 1972, the society was incorporated as a non- profit corporation under the name of St. Paul's Operatic Society Inc. In 1965, Leonard Langmead became stage director of the St. Paul's Operatic Society and served as stage director for nearly 35 years. Marian Siminski has been the company's music director since 1984. =Later history= In 1980, after the dissolution of ties with St. Paul‚Äôs Church, the name of the company was changed to Lakeshore Light Opera Inc. ‚Äì La Soci√©t√© d'Op√©rette Lakeshore Inc. For over 35 years, proceeds from the annual production have been contributed to the Lakeshore General Hospital, through the Lakeshore General Hospital Foundation.

Humo held highest positions in the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1972, Humo and Osman Karabegoviƒá came into conflict with the leadership of the League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina, accusing it for the establishment of \\"undemocratic relations\\" and the introduction of a \\"strong- arm led regime\\". This led to Humo and Karabegoviƒá being stripped of their posts. Biography Humo was born in Mostar on 1 February 1914. He joined the revolutionary movement while he attended high school in gymnasium in Mostar. Because he was expelled from the gymnasium in Mostar, he continued his education in Bihaƒá. Subsequently, he enrolled the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology, where he obtained a degree in world and Yugoslav literature. At the University, he was one of the organizers and participants in actions of the socialist-oriented students. He became a member of SKOJ in 1934 and a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in 1935. He organized students of Bosnia and Herzegovina into the \\"Petar Koƒçiƒá\\" youth society and the \\"Neretva\\" section where members of Communist Party were also active. Humo was one of the most prominent party members before World War II in Yugoslavia. In 1940 he became a member of the Regional Committee of Communist Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was also one of the resistance organizers in Herzegovina against Axis forces. Because he was educated and well read, Humo was nicknamed \\"Kulturni\\" by his comrades. His nickname, \\"kulturni\\" in Serbo- Croatian and Bosnian can loosely be translated as polite, cultured or well- read. Listening to command he moved to Sarajevo and continued his activity there. As the party's Vice-President he participated in the First and Second Assembly of ZAVNOBiH. He was also a member of the AVNOJ. Humo was a founding member of the famous Bosnian newspaper Osloboƒëenje. He served on various party and state positions, including as the President of the Executive Council of PR Bosnia and Herzegovina (de facto Prime Minister). He was proclaimed People's Hero of Yugoslavia on 27 November 1953.

His works include nearly fifty books including several monographs, principally about the waterfowl and cranes. Born in Fargo, North Dakota, he was introduced to the study of birds by a distant cousin who was a game warden. He spent these early years taking part in duck counts. After high school and junior college at Wahpeton, he enrolled at North Dakota State University to major in zoology. He then moved to Washington State University for his master's degree, encouraged by a professor who suggested that he could have a career in ornithology. His master's study was on the impact of the construction of O'Sullivan Dam to wetland habitats. Apart from the data collected and his interpretation, it included his pen sketches. This was published in The Condor and the article attracted the attention of Charles Sibley who invited him to consider a Ph.D. at Cornell University with him. His Ph.D. work was on the phylogeny of six ducks, after which he moved to England at the Wildfowl Trust at Gloucestershire founded by Sir Peter Scott. After the course of two years, he produced his first book, the Handbook of Waterfowl Behaviour published by Cornell University in 1965.

Clinical excellence must be the priority for any health care system. However, the best healthcare systems combine professional (clinical) service excellence with outstanding personal service. Although health care in the United States is touted as the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs largest service industry,‚Äù the quality of the service is infrequently discussed in medical literature. Thus, many questions regarding service excellence in healthcare largely remain unanswered. Service excellence in healthcare is difficult to define and better described as a ‚ÄúI know when I receive it, or perhaps more frequently, I know when I have not.‚Äù According to Robert Johnson (Institute of Customer Service), service excellence has four key elements: delivering the promise of quality healthcare, providing a personal touch, doing a more than adequate job and resolving problems well. In order to achieve these elements, healthcare institutions, in particular, must be concerned with reducing the drivers of dissatisfaction, and providing exceptional healthcare. According to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), exceptional healthcare is defined as ‚Äúdoing the right thing, at the right time, for the right person, and having the best quality result [outcome].‚Äù  Methods to evaluate quality of care  During the past decade, healthcare has been receiving increased attention not only because of unsustainable costs, but also because of an emphasis on quality of care improvement. Institutions are now attempting to measure and compare quality outcomes, as well as report them in both the consumer press and peer reviews literature to the delight of some and the consternation of others. Managers of healthcare delivery systems endeavor to provide the highest possible care achievable. Inherent to this goal is the need for evaluation of the quality of the health services provided. Measuring patient satisfaction is an indirect measure of quality, and can pose some difficult challenges to individuals attempting to assess quality. One difficulty is that in healthcare it is difficult to assess a patient's outcome after receiving care compared to the outcome they would have had with a different provider. The most important problem is establishing a definition of ‚Äúsatisfaction.‚Äù Because the definition of satisfaction can vary from patient to patient, many institutions have created surveys asking patients to rate the quality of the services they have received. This method of evaluation is extremely subjective, and many factors unrelated to the quality of care (the topic of interest) can affect the results. For example, a review of 37 studies addressing different methods of satisfaction evaluation found that phone interview increased the response rate by 30%. Additionally, mailing surveys resulted in more criticism and less satisfaction. Some speculate that this is due to the anonymity and a lack of pressure for socially acceptable responses. Mailing surveys also results in more variability in response than a phone survey with patients either feeling really satisfied or dissatisfied. Even the timing of administration of the survey can have a major effect on the results. The literature of the studies in this area suggests further research needs to be conducted on this topic. Crow et al. also point out that if patients are not constrained by outside factors, the selection of which healthcare facility to receive care in is an objective measurement of a their satisfaction. When satisfaction is low, a service failure has occurred. = Service Failure = Every patient has a basic assumption that the healthcare services they seek, and pay for, will meet their expectations. If these expectations are met then they are satisfied. Moreover, if these expectations are exceeded the patient is delighted, and much more likely to recommend the healthcare institution to friends and family members. However, when these expectations are not met the patient is much more likely to share this disappointment with more than just their immediate circle. Service failures are inevitable, but anticipating service failures can significantly affect patient satisfaction. A measure of a well-managed organization is whether they work hard to plan for, prevent, identify, and correct any and all service failures. These steps are key because if a patient experiences a service failure early in their encounters with a healthcare institutions, it's likely to weigh more heavily on their decisions to return to the healthcare institution. More important, however, is whether the service failure is corrected because patients are not very tolerant of poor service recovery. Meaning, if a patient experiences the same service failure twice it is likely this patient will be lost to the institution forever. A study conducted by Bowen and Johnson suggests that this is true because patients are more angered by the belief that the system in which the service failure occurred remains unchanged than their dissatisfaction with the service itself. In other words, patients are put off by a healthcare organization that makes no efforts to correct its mistakes. Learning the sources of service failures is not only important to the customer, but it is also important to the bottom line. = Sources of Service Failure = Every point in the healthcare experience has a potential to result in a service failure. For example, if a health service takes longer than a patient expects, or if a service does have the outcome the patient was anticipating, a service failure has occurred. Even the setting or environment in which the care is being provided can affect a service failure. Perhaps surprisingly, patients themselves can contribute to service failures by failing to read signage or correctly completing required forms. Finally, rude, untrained, or poorly trained staff members can bring about a service failure. Thus, the service product, setting, delivery system, and staff must be carefully managed to minimize the likelihood of a service failure. If a healthcare institution does not make changes in response to a service failure, it fails twice: * once because it was unable to meet the basic expectations of the patient, and * the second time because it did not resolve the circumstances that lead to the service failure. This can be difficult to accomplish because it is the patient who defines the quality of the experience, and by association the nature and severity of the service failure. However, regardless of the cause of the failure it can lead to Patient Defection. = Patient Defection = Decreasing service failures and focusing on service excellence can decrease patient defection (leaving one healthcare institution for another). Having a solid service recovery plan when service failures do occur is key to ensuing an excellent healthcare experience for every patient. Service failures resulting in patient defection do not only derail the goal of service excellence, but they affect the bottom line. A study performed by Reichheld and Sasser found that reducing patient defection by 5% can raise profits between 25%-85%.  Programs focusing on Service Excellence in Healthcare  Often there is a gap between what an organization wants to do and what the employees actually do, so many times many institutions set up infrastructure to focus on service excellence. In an effort to provide patients with the highest possible quality of clinical care, the National institute of clinical excellence (NICE) was created. This program attempts to provide health professionals in the United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) with the skills they need to provide high-quality cost-effective clinical care by focusing on Service Excellence. These efforts are not unique to the United Kingdom. In Prescription for Excellence, Joseph Michelli gives a detailed review of the steps Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center has taken to provide service excellence in healthcare.  Criticism  Service excellence in healthcare has been found to have unintended adverse effects: * Higher patient satisfaction has been found to be associated with higher overall health care and prescription drug expenditures, and increased mortality. * Focus on patient satisfaction metrics has redistributed resources from medical care to patient amenities, such as \\"valet parking, live music, custom-order room-service meals, and flat-screen televisions. * Scripted interactions, designed to summarize key points in satisfaction questionnaires, make professionals feel robbed of their autonomy * Treating patients as customers can lead to focusing on patients being happy, instead of being well * Service to the customer may take the provider from the typical customer service approach, to striving to provide immediate customer gratification  References  Health care quality ","title":"Service Excellence ‚Äì Health Care"},{"id":"31273401","text":"The Ashton-under-Lyne trolleybus system once served the market town of Ashton- under-Lyne, now in the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside, Greater Manchester, north west England.

It is being studied for a potential role in the treatment of left ventricular systolic heart failure. Systolic heart failure involves a loss of effective actin-myosin cross bridges in the myocytes (heart muscle cells) of the left ventricle, which leads to a decreased ability of the heart to move blood through the body. This causes peripheral edema (blood pooling), which the sympathetic nervous system tries to correct by overstimulating the cardiac myocytes, leading to left ventricular hypertrophy, another characteristic of chronic heart failure. Current inotropic therapies work by increasing the force of cardiac contraction, such as through calcium conduction or modulating adrenoreceptors. But these are limited by adverse events, including arrhythmias related to increased myocardical oxygen consumption, desensitization of adrenergic receptors, and altering intracellular calcium levels. Inotropes are also thought to be associated with worse prognosis. Therefore, the novel mechanism of omecamtiv mecarbil may offer a useful new option for heart failure. Mechanism of action Cardiac myocytes contract through a cross-bridge cycle between the myofilaments, actin and myosin. Chemical energy in the form of ATP is converted into mechanical energy which allows myosin to strongly bind to actin and produce a power stroke resulting in sarcomere shortening/contraction. Omecamtiv mecarbil specifically targets and activates myocardial ATPase and improves energy utilization. This enhances effective myosin cross-bridge formation and duration, while the velocity of contraction remains the same. Specifically, it increases the rate of phosphate release from myosin by stabilizing the pre- powerstroke and the phosphate release states, thereby accelerating the rate- determining step of the cross-bridge cycle, which is the transition of the actin-myosin complex from the weakly bound to the strongly bound state. Furthermore, once myosin is bound to actin, it stays bound dramatically longer in the presence of omecamtiv mecarbil. The combination of increased and prolonged cross-bridge formation prolongs myocardial contraction. Thus, the overall clinical result of omecamtiv mecarbil is an increase in left ventricular systolic ejection time and ejection fraction. There is a slight decrease in heart rate while myocardial oxygen consumption is unaffected. The increased cardiac output is independent of intracellular calcium and cAMP levels. Thus omecamtiv mecarbil improves systolic function by increasing the systolic ejection duration and stroke volume, without consuming more ATP energy, oxygen or altering intracellular calcium levels causing an overall improvement in cardiac efficiency. Clinical trials Experimental studies on rats and dogs, proved the efficacy and mechanism of action of omecamtiv mecarbil. Current clinical studies on humans have shown there is a direct linear relationship between dose and systolic ejection time. The dose- dependent effects persisted throughout the entire trial, suggesting that desensitization does not occur. The maximum tolerated dose was observed to be an infusion of 0.5 mg/kg/h. Adverse effects, such as ischemia, were only seen at doses beyond this level, due to extreme lengthening of systolic ejection time. Thus due to the unique cardiac myosin activation mechanism, omecamtiv mecarbil could safely improve cardiac function within tolerated doses. Omecamtiv mecarbil effectively relieves symptoms and enhances the quality of life of systolic heart failure patients. It drastically improves cardiac performance in the short term; however, the hopeful long-term effects of reduced mortality have yet to be studied. Myosin inhibition Recently, research groups found that omecamtiv mecarbil actually inhibits myosin by enhancing the duty ratio, increasing calcium sensitivity and slowing force development.Swenson AM, et al. Omecamtiv mecarbil enhances the duty ratio of human Œ≤-cardiac myosin resulting in increased calcium sensitivity and slowed force development in cardiac muscle. J Biol Chem. 2017;292:3768‚Äì3778 It may still activate muscle as a whole however despite suppressing the working stroke of myosin.Woody MS, et al. Positive cardiac inotrope omecamtiv mecarbil activates muscle despite suppressing the myosin working stroke. Nat Commun. 2018;9:3838. History The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted in May 2020 a fast-track designation for omecamtiv mecarbil. The designation \\"represents an important milestone in the development of omecamtiv mecarbil,\\" commented David Reese, head of R&D; at Amgen, noting that \\"half of heart failure patients will die within five years of diagnosis, underscoring the urgent need for new therapies for this grievous condition\\".

Early life Margarethe's parents were Prussian nobility. Her father was Lieutenant Colonel Ludolf von Oven of the 115th Guards Infantry Regiment (1st Grand Duchy of Hesse. Her father was killed on 22 August 1914 in the opening weeks of the First World War. Margarethe was raised with three siblings by her mother. Career In 1920, Margarethe began work as a secretary in order to support her family financially. In 1925, she took a position as a secretary in the Defense Ministry and in 1928 she was sent to the military attache's office in Moscow for six months under an assumed name. She was on a secret mission at the time when the Reichswehr and Red Army were still collaborating. From 1930 to 1935 she worked in Berlin at the Reichswehr Ministry. In 1938 she moved to Budapest and later, in 1940, to Lisbon as a secretary in the German military attach√© office. =At the Bendlerblock= In her prewar Berlin days, she had worked as a secretary for Colonel General Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord and Colonel General Werner von Fritsch in the Bendlerblock headquarters of the Defense Ministry. In the summer of 1943, Major General Henning von Tresckow requested that she be transferred to his office, placing complete trust in her because she was his wife's best friend since childhood. Through her relationship with von Tresckow, Margarethe was drawn into the preparations for the 20 July 1944 coup attempt against Hitler known as the 20 July Plot or the Valkyrie Conspiracy. Because von Tresckow was assigned to the Eastern Front, Margarethe was reassigned as a secretary in the headquarters of Army Group Centre, serving as a news headline monitor for the Berlin coup plotters. She also typed the orders and decrees in preparation for the coup. She frequently met with Tresckow and Claus von Stauffenberg during the summer and fall of 1943 outside the Bendlerblock in order to discuss and modify orders and was fully aware of the plot.

Frankfurt am Main: Fischer, , p. 107. =Arrest= After the failure of the assassination attempt on 20 July 1944, Margarethe was jailed for two weeks, but was then allowed to return to her job at the Bendlerblock. Post- war After the war, Margarethe von Oven worked for one year in Switzerland, then returned to Germany and worked as an assistant in a medical practice. In 1954, she was employed in the investment management office for the House of Brandenburg-Prussia. In 1955, she married Wilfred Graf von Hardenberg, brother of Karl Hans von Hardenberg, living in G√∂ttingen until her death. Film portrayals In the 2004 German production Stauffenberg, von Oven is portrayed by actress Stefania Rocca.

History Theatercaf√©en opened in 1900 and is situated opposite from the National Theatre, which had opened the previous year. The restaurant and the hotel was originally owned by the Foss Brewery (Foss Bryggeri). Caroline Boman Hansen (1860‚Äì1956) and Christian Boman Hansen (1868‚Äì1915) took over the lease in 1909, and within only three years they were able to purchase the establishment. Elisabeth C. Brochmann is the current and fourth generation owner. In 1985, she took over the management from her mother Ellen Brochmann. Theatercaf√©en was modernized in 1949, and the restaurant lost some of its distinct ambiance. In 1971, Theatercafeen was again renovated, and this time back to its original Art Nouveau style, under supervision of the architect Hans Gabriel Finne. Parts of the original fixtures and furniture were still intact, and through studies of old photographs it was possible to bring the Theatercafeen back to its original style. Inspiration was also gathered on travels to Paris, Copenhagen, and Stockholm. The floor is made from over 100,000 small pieces of linoleum. The restaurant was again renovated in 2010, and it now features a new bar area and a chambre s√©par√©e. Theatercaf√©en quickly became the meeting point for influential members of the Norwegian art and culture scene, including Sigurd B√∏dker, Sven Elvestad, Herman Wildenvey as well as actors and actresses from the National Theatre. Starting in 1924, portraits of such guests were made and placed on the walls of the restaurant. The tradition has continued, and the collection now contains 81 portraits of authors, actors, painters, photographers, musicians, and composers, all former or current patrons of the house.

Marianne Cohn was a German-born French Resistance fighter. She was born on 17 September 1922 in Mannheim and died on 8 July 1944 in Haute-Savoie. Biography Marianne Cohn was the eldest child of a family of German intellectuals of Jewish descent, but they did not practice Judaism and had little connection to the Jewish community of Germany. The family left Germany, eventually settling in France where Marianne's parents were deported to the Gurs internment camp, as German nationals. She and her sister were taken in by the Jewish Scouts organization, with the opportunity to rediscover their Jewish identity. In 1942 Marianne began to smuggle Jewish children out of France. Threatened with deportation, she was incarcerated at Nice and released three months later. It was during this initial detention in 1943, she wrote her famous poem \\"Je trahirai demain\\" (I shall betray tomorrow): After her release she resumed her underground activities, supervising children before their departure for Switzerland. Later, in January 1944, she began working with Rolande Birgy (see French Wikipedia article), shuttling two or three groups, each with up to twenty children across the southern border, passing through Lyon and Annecy. Birgy had been teamed with Mila Racine (see French Wikipedia article) before she was arrested on 21 October 1943.Je voudrais √©voquer ici le souvenir de quatre de mes camarades de R√©sistance...

Cohn was arrested on 31 May 1944 near Annemasse with a group of twenty-eight children, including Renee Bornstein and incarcerated at the Hotel Pax by the Gestapo. Despite the torture, she did not speak. Her resistance unit formed a plan to free her, but she refused, fearing reprisals on children.Mordecai Paldiel (2012).

GO worked in several media including film and video and participated in over 20 international exhibitions. In January 1985 the group committed an act of 'art terrorism' by smuggling one of its paintings into the International Contemporary Arts Fair in London. The following year it mounted an attack on Cork Street, then the centre of the London art world, splashing grey paint on the windows of a number of galleries. After this, members of the group were arrested and for a time banned from central London. This resulted in them relocating to New York City where they exhibited at The Civilian Warfare Gallery in the East Village. The members of the group were Toby Mott, Daniel Saccoccio, Tim Burke and Paul Spencer.Their activities and attitude towards the traditional British art establishment greatly influenced The Young British Artists from 1988 onwards.  Biography  Police raid on the exhibition Money, Young Unknowns Gallery, London, 1986. A work by GO can be seen held in the left hand of the policeman second-closest to the camera Direct art action, Cork Street, 21 May 1985 After moving to Bow in East London, Toby Mott and childhood friends Daniel Saccoccio, Tim Burke and Paul Spencer formed Grey Organisation in 1982 as a response to the \\"prevailing Thatcherite free market consumerist culture\\". GO's origins can be found in the Punk movement and 1970s' youth politics, the quartet having been members of the Anarchist Street Army. They eschewed the more common anarcho-aesthetic opting instead to dress uniformly in grey suits, with heads shaved in a parody of yuppie and Soviet \\"corporate monoculture\\". On 28 July 1984, GO organised a live concert for Psychic TV. It took place in a derelict circular building in Drayton Park, London and was recorded live and released as Temporary Temple. The same year, GO directed the film Grey Moments. In 1985, GO began a series of direct art- actions; launching attacks on the International Contemporary Arts Fair in London by sneaking paintings into the fair; and an attack on Cork Street covering some of London‚Äôs most famous galleries in grey paint \\"arguably something inherited from the strategies of disobedience of May '68 Paris, culled from the heroism of Guy Debord\\". In a press release GO justified the attacks on Cork Street, describing the galleries established there as \\"boring and lifeless\\" and stating they \\"intended to liven up their lives a bit!\\". The attack took place on Tuesday 21 May 1985, somewhere between midnight and 6am. Members of the Grey Organisation were later arrested, released on bail and banned from central London, but when prosecuted at Well Street Magistrates' court, pleaded 'Not Guilty' and were released without charge.Art Line Magazine (International Art News), Vol, 2 No 9, 1985. Subsequently, in 1986, GO moved to New York to escape further attempts at prosecution.The Guardian, Saturday, 31 May 1986 In 1986, GO took part in the exhibition Money organised by J. S. G. Boggs, the notorious banknote-copying artist, at the Young Unknowns Gallery. The exhibition was raided by police and works, including those by GO, were confiscated.Arena: Money Man ‚Äì On the Road with J.S.G. Boggs (BBC, 15 January 1993 ‚Äì Money Man at the Internet Movie Database) \\"In the England of the 1980s, there were others creating their own vision reacting to the prevailing Thatcherite free market consumerist culture. Psychic Youth, Test Department. Laibach. My own involvement was with the art, filmmaking group the Grey Organization. We parodied yuppie and Soviet corporate monoculture with our uniformed anonymity, shaved heads, white shirts, English suits, making and exhibiting art as product without individual authorship, something inspired from the rigorous orthodoxy of Crass\\". From the essay 'Crass, an education' by Toby Mott, Crass 1977‚Äì1984, PPP Editions, 2011.  Artworks   Fashion and PR  Young members of Red Wedge wearing Grey Organisation t-shirts designed for the Labour Party, 1987. GO‚Äôs image of uniformed anonymity, shaved heads, white shirts, and grey English suits were key to the GO manifesto. They stated that wearing suits afforded them the respect necessary in the 1999, but shunned the wearing of ties stating, \\"We wear no ties. All those who see themselves as dissidents in society do like-wise\\". GO's recognition began to grow outside of the art world when Lynne Franks launched the Grey Organisation into the 1980s' world of PR; modelling for Katharine Hamnett at the Albert Hall and Yohji Yamamoto in Paris; supporting Red Wedge; meeting Neil Kinnock at the Houses of Parliament; and promoting Swatch watches. Red Wedge was underpinned by a party political broadcast in July 1985 aimed specifically at the young vote. It featured clips from Labour-organised rock concerts, including the performances of Billy Bragg, Aswad and the Communards, extracts from Neil Kinnock‚Äôs speeches and interviews with young men and women about the misery of unemployment. The Labour Party also commissioned designers Katharine Hammett, Bodymap and the Grey Organisation to design T-shirts for its Jobs and Industry campaign which largely concentrated on the plight of the young unemployed.Young Conservatives, Young Socialists And The Great Youth Abstention: Youth Participation And Nonparticipation In Political Parties.

Album artwork  De La Soul, 3 Feet High and Rising, album cover by the Grey Organisation In the 1980s, whilst living in New York, GO produced a series of album covers for Tommy Boy Records, including for De La Soul's 3 Feet High and Rising and for the band Information Society; and made music videos for bands such as the Rolling Stones (\\"Mixed Emotions\\"), Public Enemy (\\"Shut 'Em Down\\"), and A Tribe Called Quest (\\"Can I Kick It\\"). In 2013, GO member Toby Mott was scheduled to exhibit a print edition of the original 3 Feet High and Rising album art work, displayed alongside memorabilia such as Mott's original sketch, his gold disc, and other items from his private collection. In an essay written to accompany the exhibition, Mott describes the process of designing the album cover: \\"De La Soul visit our loft where we lay them down on the floor facing up, their heads making a triangle. We photograph them whilst hanging precariously off a step ladder, one idea being that the cover would not have a right way up. CD's have yet to be the dominant musical format so the vinyl album sleeve is our most effective way of making a statement [...] The intent of the design of De La Soul's, 3 Feet High and Rising LP cover is to be new and bright, with the overlaying of the fluorescent flowers and text reflecting a synthetic pop cartoon look [...] This is a move away from the prevailing macho hip hop visual codes which dominate to this day\\".  Identity  GO ID Card, issued 1 February 1984 The GO logo was stamped on everything the group produced, from artworks to manifestos, from clothing to communiqu√©s. The group also issued ID cards to all members, which included a portrait photograph, their names, date of birth, height, eye and hair colour, issue date and finger print.  After the Grey Organisation  When GO disbanded in 1991, Toby Mott pursued a solo career exhibiting at White Columns NYC, The Thomas Soloman Garage, Los Angeles and Interim Art, London.

History The taxon Laevistrombus was introduced in the literature as a subgenus of Strombus by Tetsuaki Kira (1955) in the third printing of the 1st edition of Coloured Illustrations of the Shells of Japan. It comprised two species, Strombus (Laevistrombus) canarium and Strombus (L.) isabella Lamarck, 1822. No type specimen was designated, and Kira gave no formal description or statement of differentiation, as required by the ICZN code to validate the name. In a later version of the book, Laevistrombus was elevated to genus level, but a description was still lacking. R√ºdiger Bieler and Richard Petit (1996) considered it a nomen nudum, and the authorship was transferred to Robert Tucker Abbott (1960), who had provided a proper description and illustrations of Laevistrombus and specified a type species, Strombus canarium L., in the first volume of his monograph Indo-Pacific Mollusca. The currently accepted classification was proposed by Sepkoski (2002), who elevated Laevistrombus to genus level based on palaeontological data.

Unlike some other improvement bodies the RIEPs are notable for having strong governance from networks of councils within each region, this recognises that the local government sector is best placed to lead its own improvement and ensures that the RIEP offer targets the defined needs of the sector. The RIEPs aimed to bring additional skills to local government, to promote improvement and efficiency. History The nine RIEPs were created in April 2008 with a three-year funding package of ¬£185 million from Communities and Local Government. The RIEPs were established following the December 2007 National Improvement and Efficiency Strategy for Local Government, which was produced jointly by the Local Government Group (then called the Local Government Association) and Communities and Local Government.National Improvement and Efficiency Strategy The strategy acknowledged that improvement architecture needed to be better coordinated and closer to the front line in order to be more effective. The RIEPs, made up of networks of councils, were the vehicle for delivering this through using their devolved funding, spreading knowledge and good practice and navigating councils through the maze of improvement support. The RIEPs' three-year funded programme finished at the end of March 2011 and the government did not commit additional funding to support them. The RIEPs' core functions included: *acting as a hub to coordinate and focus resources on supporting councils and partners to deliver excellent local area agreement (LAA) outcomes *supporting improvement and help local authorities to accelerate and add to their efficiency savings *supporting councils in their response to the economic downturn *identifying and share good practice and stimulate innovation *establishing partnerships and networks to address performance issues. In general the RIEPs focussed on critical areas where improving efficiency and performance has the largest impact. Many of the biggest savings have been made in procurement through facilitating consortia and developing improved frameworks, usually housed in procurement hubs, and by using other mechanisms to reduce prices, for example by developing fair pricing tools or setting up eAuctions. RIEPs also worked to drive cashable efficiencies in business transformation and shared services. RIEPs supported transformation projects and invested in providing training to ensure skills remained in the sector. The Local Productivity Programme mapped over 200 examples of shared services, many of which were supported by the RIEPs. Most of the RIEPs have also run successful programmes supporting improvements in children‚Äôs services, adult social care and economic regeneration. They worked with national bodies such as Local Government Improvement and Development (formerly the Improvement and Development Agency) as well as government offices (GOs) and inspectorates. This aimed to ensure that resources were dedicated to prevention and support, particularly peer support, thereby avoiding government intervention. They also worked with LG Group to develop the Local Productivity Programme, helping to define and shape the programme and contributing over 30 (of 100) productivity opportunities that councils could use to increase their productivity. Together the nine RIEPs had saved almost ¬£1bn by April 2011 from an initial outlay of ¬£185m. Over the same period the Audit Commission also found that council performance improved markedly with very few councils being assessed as under performing. The RIEPs have had an important role in supporting councils and partners to work together to purchase collaboratively, share services and to take a multi- agency \\"Total Place\\" approach to tackling serious problems.

Location The tower house complex is located on a small road off the modern road from Clonmel to Cahir; while visible from the main road, it is on private land. It stands on a grassed limestone hillock. History Moorstown Castle was built by James Keating, an ally of the Earl of Ormond. The castle and associated lands passed, under a mortgage agreement, to Robert Cox of Bruff in 1635, and then by marriage to the Greene family. It was bought by Richard Grubb through the Landed Estates Court in 1855. As of 2011, the property remained in private ownership. It is thought that the 17th-century Catholic priest, poet and historian Geoffrey Keating (Seathr√∫n C√©itinn) had family connections with the castle; evidence suggests that he may have been the third son of James FitzEdmund Keating of Moorstown. Structure Moorstown consists of a circular tower house or keep, and a protective walled courtyard or bawn; the bawn was probably built first and the tower house added later. The bawn, built with limestone facing inside and outside, and a rubble core, has two defensive towers, to the southwest and northeast, and a fortified gatehouse with residential space for guards. The four-storey circular tower house found at Moorstown is unusual in Irish architecture, most Irish tower houses being square, but the form is found at several locations in County Tipperary. There is a spiral staircase, and the main living space was on the second floor. The second floor has one larger window; otherwise most of the windows of the building are small. The third floor is believed to have been used to accommodate doves. There are musket loops for defence in multiple locations, and the building has parapets but no battlements. Popular culture Moorstown Castle was one of the Tipperary locations used in Stanley Kubrick's 1975 epic film Barry Lyndon.

The lyrics are based on the Biblical verse in Hosea 6:3.

There is now a movement to bring back certain traditional hymns such as \\"Follow On\\" into current usage. The hymn's music has been adopted for the anthem of the Scottish association football club, Rangers, in their club anthem, \\"Follow Follow\\". There have been disagreements over the Rangers fans' usage of the hymn's music as their anthem with claims such as from the Boys' Brigade complaining that using it and changing the lyrics prevented it from remaining a major hymn in their organization because of the association with Rangers.

The founder of Black Ocean, an independent press, and publisher of its journal Handsome, he is also the author of three collections of his poetry: Your Name Is The Only Freedom (Brave Men Press, 2009), The World Will Deny It For You (Ahsahta Press, 2012), and The Truth Is We Are Perfect (Third Man Books, forthcoming Spring 2015). His articles have been published by The Huffington Post and The Poetry Foundation. In 2010, he was awarded the title Best Poet by The Boston Phoenix in its annual \\"Boston's Best\\" reader's poll.  Personal life  Janaka Stucky was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and spent much of his childhood in an ashram. He was originally named Jonathan, but \\"when he was eight months old, his parents' guru suggested they christen him Janaka,\\" after the ancient king of Mithila, a spiritual leader whose philosophy is chronicled in the Ashtavakra Gita and whose attainment of perfection is mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita (III,20,25). Stucky received a BFA degree from Emerson College, where he co-founded the street poetry collective The Guerilla Poets. He received his MFA degree in Poetry from Vermont College in 2003. From 2002 to 2009, he worked as an undertaker, which, he says, \\"influenced and informed my work a great deal. ... I came to understand the poem as a ritual, a funeral for the constant death of language.\\" He is also interested in boxing.  Writing and career  = The Guerilla Poets = During his senior year at Emerson College, Stucky co-founded The Guerilla Poets, a group which gave spontaneous public poetry performances in non-traditional locations, such as streetcorners, malls, fast-food restaurants, and subways. The group appeared at the People's Poetry Gathering in New York City, where Stucky won a head-to- head haiku competition against established Vermont poet Marc Awodey, impressing Awodey so much that he published a selection of the group's poems, Speak These Words: A Guerilla Poets Anthology (2001), edited by Stucky.https://www.amazon.com/Speak-These-Words-Guerilla- anthology/dp/1930149085 The group subsequently toured in a van across the United States three times, at one point performing as many as thirty shows in twenty days and selling more than nine hundred copies of their book, a large number for a book of poems by unestablished poets. The Guerilla Poets disbanded in 2002. = Black Cat Burlesque, Feast of Flesh, Black Ocean = In 2003 he co-founded the Boston-based horror-themed neo-burlesque troupe \\"Black Cat Burlesque,\\" performing and emceeing under the name J. Cannibal and becoming known as the \\"King of Horror Burlesque.\\" As J. Cannibal, Stucky initiated what grew into a popular semi-annual horror-movie and entertainment night called J. Cannibal's Feast of Flesh. In 2010, for its tenth occurrence, he expanded it into a nine-day horror-film festival, Terrorthon. As of October, 2014, however, he terminated the Feast of Flesh evenings to concentrate more on organizing poetry readings and other literary events. In 2004, Stucky founded Black Ocean, an independent press publishing mostly poetry, with staff in Boston, Chicago, and Detroit, which he continues to run. He is also the publisher of Handsome, the press's annual literary magazine. Black Ocean has published books by Zachary Schomburg, Aase Berg, Brandon Shimoda, and Joshua Harmon, among others. For some time Black Ocean produced Black Cat Burlesque events and J. Cannibal's Feast of Flesh, although as of 2014 it no longer does. Stucky's poems have appeared in Cannibal, Denver Quarterly, Fence, Free Verse, No Tell Motel, North American Review, redivider, The Equalizer, and VOLT. He wrote the introduction to Marc Awodey's 2008 collection of poems and artwork, Senryu & Nudes. In November 2009, Brave Men Press published a chapbook of his poems entitled Your Name Is The Only Freedom.http://eunuchsblues.blogspot.com/2009/11/now-available-from-brave-men- press-your.html In April 2010, readers of the Boston Phoenix named Stucky \\"Best Poet\\" in the paper's annual Boston's Best poll.

It was selected by Catherine Wagner to win the first Ahsahta Press chapbook contest. Randolph Pfaff reviewed the book for apt, the literary journal of Aforementioned Productions: > There are reminders here of the imagery of Paul Celan and Mina Loy, > certainly, but Stucky's consistency of thought creates a throughline of loss > and reconciliation‚Äîand more than anything else, the vast space in between > the two‚Äîthat is all his own.

The operations were considered secret and, as such, were covered by the Official Secrets Act.  Operation  When the radar defence of Great Britain was set up, Robert Watson-Watt and his team created a chain of radar stations around the coastline. The stations were named Chain Home (CH). Radar detection of objects at that time was at its early stages of development and there was a need for a method to combine the different radar information gathered from different stations. Accurate details of incoming or outgoing aircraft were obtained by combining overlapping reports from adjacent radar stations and then collating and correcting them. This process of combining information was called \\"filtering\\" and took place in seven Filter Rooms. Each filter room was attached to a Fighter Command Group.General operation of filter rooms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFN4uE2b9hA&channel;=candyjartv The Filter Room personnel was divided to Plotters, Filterers and Controllers. To avoid errors and delays, clear English was insisted upon. A shortage of fighter aircraft, trained pilots and fuel created a need for filter room personnel to work with great speed. Plotters received radar information by telephone. They displayed it on a gridded map table using various counters. The gridded map indicated a pinpoint position, estimated height, number of aircraft, and whether Identification Friend or Foe (IFF). Plotters were mainly Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) personnel ‚Äî young women who worked eight-hour watches in underground bunkers. Each radar station was allocated with a colour and position plots, numbered one to five, signified time received. Filterer Officers ‚Äî or 'Filterers' ‚Äî filtered the information, correcting it and placing an arrow giving direction and position. The information on each track was displayed on a magnetised metal plaque. The Filterer's job \\"was to decide the moment when a few successive plots, with all their possible inaccuracies, might be considered as a reliable track, fit for the operations room to act on for fighter interception\\".Royal Air Force Signals History, Volume 4 - Radar in Raid Reporting and Volume 5 Fighter Control and Interception (TNA Kew AIR 10/5519 & AIR 10/5520, respectively) Such tracks were indicated by the Filterer placing an arrow on the table showing the position and direction of the raid. The filterers constantly had to make a relatively difficult decision of \\"whether to put down an arrow on the strength of his (her) first guess, or to wait for another plot in the hope that it would confirm or confound his (her) suspicions.\\" Acting quickly gained valuable time but risked fighters taking off on false information. Waiting for more information reduced the chance of interception. Squadron Leader Mike Dean MBE, referring to the filterer's job, explained: \\"The mass of raw information generated by the Home Chain of radars had to be processed before it could be presented to the Operations Room. The complexity of the Filter Room task cannot be overstated. Much depended on the Filterer‚Äôs detailed knowledge of the performance and limitations of each individual radar and their confidence in the ability of the crews on watch. The Filterer‚Äôs ability to correlate the information quickly and assess the probability of the true radar picture underpinned the successful operation of the whole radar system.\\"Squadron Leader Mike Dean MBE, Historical Radar Archive, March 2011 Controllers were senior officers who used reports from the Movement Liaison Section to identify each track as friendly or hostile. The resulting information would then be communicated by phone by a WAAF teller to all who needed to know, including Air Raid Warning Officers, Royal Observer Corps, Ack Ack Artillery, Air Sea Rescue Centres and Group and Sector Operations Rooms who would then order fighter interceptions of the hostile aircraft. Controllers were stationed on a balcony above the filterers. The Controllers were recruited from the London Stock Exchange, typically because they were accustomed to making swift decisions under pressure.  Radar improvements  As radar equipment improved, the Filter Room received additional reports from Chain Home Low (CHL) and Chain Home Extra Low (CHEL), increasing tracking accuracy. In 1944 warnings were given of V-1 flying bombs (doodle bugs) and V-2 rockets.

FOM was formed in December 2003 following the violent death of Eevan Naseem on September 19, 2003 in Maafushi Prison, Maldives and the subsequent unrest in prisons which resulted in twenty people being shot and three killed. The initial aim of FOM was to increase awareness of human rights abuses in the Maldives as a means of building support for long-awaited reforms. FOM worked closely with leading human rights NGOs, media, government bodies and international institutions to ensure a greater awareness of the former government‚Äôs human rights abuses. FOM was founded by David Hardingham. Sarah Mahir acted as the FOM coordinator from 2005 to 2008. Following implementation of human rights reforms after the first free and fair Presidential elections in the Maldives, FOM now works to find and assist UK volunteers to work in the Maldives on specific education, health and development projects. FOM history 2003-2008 The initial focus was on working with NGOs (Amnesty International, Article 19, Reporters Without Borders), the United Nations, political bodies (EU and British parliaments, Foreign Affairs departments, Embassies in Colombo accredited to the Maldives). FOM reported on severe restrictions on freedom of expression, persecution of journalists, arbitrary arrests and torture, in addition to regular reports on political prisoners. Public demonstrations were organised in Europe at trade fairs. There were confrontations with former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom in London and Geneva. FOM travelled to Washington, Brussels and Geneva - bringing the Maldives Human Rights issues to the desks of international human rights NGOs. FOM regularly assisted investigative journalists travelling to the Maldives by providing contacts and support in the Maldives. The FOM Selected Resort Boycott Campaign called for the boycott of resorts in the Maldives that were directly associated with the regime while encouraging visiting those not on the list. This was seen as a new and pragmatic way to highlight pressure on the regime while not adversely affecting the entire economy. FOM staff met regularly with the UK Conservative Party Human Rights Commission and engaged their help to monitor the political and human rights situation in the Maldives closely. Members of the Commission tabled several Parliamentary Questions and Early Day Motions. Assisted in finding support from International Media Support (IMS) for media training in the Maldives (early 2007) and financial assistance and support for Minivan Radio. IMS participated in the International Press Freedom Mission in May 2007. Hill and Knowlton goes to the Maldives FOM were critical of the engagement of the international PR firm Hill and Knowlton by the dictatorship as a means to clean up its image while hindering real reform. On 15 February 2007 FOM held a demonstration outside the offices of Hill and Knowlton in Soho Square, London, to protest about the ‚Äòwhitewashing‚Äô of Gayoom's dictatorship. FOM argued that there had been few real democratic reforms since Hill and Knowlton began the contract with the Government of Maldives. Tim Fallon, a former adviser to then British Prime Minister Tony Blair, was head of corporate affairs at Hill & Knowlton and managed the Maldives account. Christian missionary and Islamic extremist accusations FOM founder David Hardingham was barred from entering the Maldives during the period 2005‚Äì2008 following accusations by the former regime that he was part of an Islamic extremist plot to smuggle weapons into the Maldives. The former regime also accused FOM of being a Christian missionary organisation with links to the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP). A forged letter distributed around the Maldives purporting to be from Hardingham to Mohamed Nasheed, on a Salisbury Cathedral letterhead, described how Hardingham was planning to build a replica of Salisbury Cathedral in the Maldives. Current activities FOM now works to find and assist UK volunteers to work on specific development projects in the Maldives. The main areas covered are in the fields of Education, Health and Sport. FOM works with the Maldives High Commission in London and related Government agencies to source, assist and follow up on volunteer activities throughout the Maldives, with a special focus on areas furthers away from the capital Male‚Äô.

Congleton Museum Trust was established in 1985 by a group of people interested in local history. The museum is located in the Market square of Congleton. History Astbury Log Boat In 1985 a group of local people formed the Congleton Museum Trust. They collected artefacts, raised money and searched the town for premises suitable for a museum. In the mid-1990s, a second group of people, who planned to refurbish Congleton Town Hall with the help of Regeneration Funding, became involved, and a museum was written into the refurbishment plans. The former police station, a Victorian building which was part of the town hall complex, was proposed as the museum. The Heritage Lottery Fund awarded the project over ¬£200,000, and other local and national trusts, businesses and local authorities assisted. Building work started in January 2002, and Congleton Museum opened on 29 July 2002. It was officially opened by the Duke of Gloucester later that year.http://www.congletonmuseum.co.uk/ Collection and exhibits The museum focuses on the history of Congleton and its immediate neighbourhood, with particular emphasis on prehistory, the Civil War, the Industrial age and World War Two. The main display area is on the ground floor. On the first floor there is a research library and map collection and an education room. This is used for exhibitions, school visits, talks and social events. There are also showcases for the display of other items from the collection. The museum's collection includes a 1500BC burial urn, a log boat from the Norman period, and two 17th century coin hoards. The museum houses tableaux illustrating life in the town during prehistoric times, in the Civil War, in the heyday of the textile industry and during the Second World War. Figures from the past tell their stories, and interactive computers fill in the background. Relief maps show the changes over the centuries. The Civil War was particularly significant to Congleton ‚Äì a former mayor of the town, John Bradshaw, was first to sign Charles I's death warrant.

Life Born at Lucca in northern Italy, he was son of Stephen de Vannes of that city. In one of his letters Erasmus calls him Peter Ammonius; and he was related to Andrea Ammonio. It was through the influence of Ammonio, who was Latin secretary to Henry VIII, that Vannes was brought to England, and he became assistant to Ammonio in 1513. Shortly he also worked for Cardinal Wolsey. Ammonio died on 17 August 1517, and Vannes immediately wrote to Wolsey asking for a living. Silvestro Gigli, another native of Lucca who was bishop of Worcester, recommended Vannes to Wolsey, and Lorenzo Campeggio in 1521 sought Vannes's influence to secure his promotion to the see of Worcester. On 12 November 1521 Vannes was presented to the living of Mottram in the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield, and in 1523 he was incorporated B.D. at Cambridge. In 1526 an unsuccessful effort was made to secure for Vannes the bishopric of Lucca, and in October‚ÄìNovember of that year he was in Rome. In July 1527 he accompanied Wolsey on his magnificent embassy to France, and in November 1528 was commissioned with Sir Francis Bryan ambassador to the pope. The main purpose of the mission was to induce the pope to declare Henry VIII's marriage with Catherine of Aragon void ab initio, and with this object Vannes was specially instructed to hire advocates of Henry's cause, to bribe the cardinals, and generally to secure support wherever he could. Other objects of the mission were to withdraw the pope from his alliance with the Emperor Charles V, to discover the real causes of Campeggio's failure to proceed with the divorce question, and to make inquiry into the authenticity of the brief produced by Catherine removing all the disabilities found in the original dispensation for her marriage granted by Pope Julius II. If all other means failed, Vannes was ‚Äòto inquire whether the pope will dispense with the king to have two wives, making the children of the second marriage legitimate as well as those of the first, whereof some great reasons and precedents appear, especially in the Old Testament.‚Äô Vannes reached Florence on 9 January 1529, and was at Rome on the 28th; the mission was, however, a complete failure, and in October following Vannes returned to England. Vannes maintained friendly relations with Wolsey after his fall, which did not interfere with his advancement; on 4 Dec. 1529 he was collated to the prebend of Bedwyn in Salisbury Cathedral, and on the 16th was instituted to the rectory of Wheathamstead, Hertfordshire. On 17 July 1533 he was appointed collector of papal taxes in England, an office soon to become a sinecure; and in the same year he was sent on the king's business to Rome, Avignon, and Marseilles. On 12 May 1534 Vannes was made archdeacon of Worcester; on 22 February 1535 he was admitted prebendary of Bole in York Cathedral; on 22 September 1535 was constituted coadjutor to the dean of Salisbury, who was of unsound mind. He subscribed the articles of religion agreed upon in the convocation of 1536. In 1537 he held the prebend of Compton Dundon in Wells Cathedral, and on 3 February 1540 succeeded to the deanery of Salisbury. In April 1542 he was admitted to the prebend of Cadington Major in St Paul's Cathedral. He also received shortly afterwards the prebend of Shipton-Underwood in Salisbury Cathedral, the rectory of Tredington, Worcestershire; and in 1545 a pension on the loss of his canonry by dissolution at the Priory of St Frideswide, Oxford. Vannes apparently gave up his deanery during Edward VI's reign, but retained his Latin secretaryship, the grant of which was confirmed to him on 12 December 1549. On 19 May 1550 he was sent ambassador to Venice, where he arrived in August; his salary was forty shillings a day. In September 1551 he urged the Council of Ten to restore to Sebastian Cabot the property claimed by him, and on 16 Oct. was given credentials to the senators of his native city Lucca. Sir John Mason described Vannes's conduct as timid; but he was retained in that post by Queen Mary, who also restored to him the deanery of Salisbury. Vannes was at Venice when Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon, died there, and he sent the queen an account of that event. He was recalled in September 1556. He retained his preferments under Elizabeth and died early in 1563. By his will, dated 1 July 1562, and proved 1 May 1563, he left considerable property to his heir, Benedict Hudson alias Vannes. John Leland commemorated his friendship in an ode.

Early years Hardingham was born in South Africa, where his early studies were in Hilton College. The family later moved to the UK in 1982, where Hardingham continued his education at Dauntsey's School, an independent co-educational boarding school in Wiltshire, UK. Career He was founder of the human rights activist organisation Friends of Maldives (FOM). He was also the co-founder of the clandestine opposition radio station Minivan Radio and trustee of the UK registered charity Maldives Aid. He was appointed the Honorary Consul for the Maldives in Salisbury (UK) on 2 July 2009. Hardingham was closely involved with the movement for political reform in the Maldives as a result of his friendship with then opposition activist Mohamed Nasheed (Anni), and former President of the Maldives, whom he met while both of them were at Dauntsey's School. He was an outspoken critic of former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom‚Äôs human rights record during his thirty-year presidency, a record he maintains is confirmed by the many examples of torture undergone by Mohamed Nasheed and many others he had met during the time many opposition activists stayed at Salisbury. Owing to his criticism of the former regime, Hardingham was officially barred from entering the Maldives between 2005 and 2008. During this time, he was accused by the then-government of being both a Christian fundamentalist trying to convert Maldivians and an Islamic extremist involved in a plot to smuggle weapons into the Maldives. Further accusations were made that he and Mohamed Nasheed were conspiring to build a replica of Salisbury Cathedral in the Maldives. Hardingham has visited the Maldives several times since the change of government, but he has, to date, not been officially informed of his status. Neither has he received any further information regarding the allegations. Along with Sarah Mahir and other FOM associates Hardingham confronted Gayoom in the Palais des Nations in Geneva on 16 May 2005. Hardingham asked him why he had been blacklisted from the Maldives and about human rights abuses in the Maldives. There was no response from Gayoom. Following the FOM Selected Resorts Boycott campaign Hardingham was accused of trying to bring about a collapse of the Maldives tourism industry, a charge he strongly denies as he has always argued that the idea of the selected boycott was to apply the restrictions only to those resorts associated closely with the regime while strongly encouraging visits to other resorts and to the Maldives. Hardingham and Sarah Mahir of FOM met regularly with the UK Conservative Party Human Rights Commission and engaged their help to closely monitor the political and human rights situation in the Maldives. Members of the Commission tabled several Parliamentary Questions and Early Day Motions regarding human rights abuses in the Maldives. He was UK crossing coordinator and liaison during Guin Batten's successful rowing crossing of the Zero Degree Channel on 30 March 2010 (between Huvadhoo Atoll and Foammulah Island), a distance of approximately . The Consulate in Salisbury was officially inaugurated at an opening ceremony on 9 July 2010, attended by the Maldives High Commissioner Dr Farah Faizal and local MP for Salisbury John Glen. Hardingham has promoted guesthouse tourism in the Maldives saying that, at a time of growing competition from other luxury destinations, the growth of guesthouse tourism in the Maldives would bring more direct economic benefit to the islanders. Hardingham and FOM colleagues are currently involved in bringing skilled volunteers, starting with teachers and medics, to the Maldives from the UK. Hardingham resigned from his post as Honorary Consul to the Maldives during the coup that led to the overthrow of President Nasheed.

He is also a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Between 2006 and 2012, he worked as an advisor to the former Speaker of the National Council of the Slovak Republic Pavol Pa≈°ka (SMER-SD). In 2004‚Äì2006, Blaha worked for the Communist Party of Slovakia as the Head of its International Department.¬ªWir lehnen Privatisierungen ab¬´, in: junge Welt, 17 June 2006. Additionally, Blaha works as a political scientist at the Institute of Political Sciences at the Slovak Academy of Sciences, and teaches at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Ss. Cyril and Methodius (UCM) in Trnava.  Political activity  Blaha is a member of National Council of Slovak Republic since 2012. Blaha is a self-professed Marxist, but he rejects the former Stalinist regime. He endorses modern Western Marxism, radical democratic movements and culturally liberal positions.http://www.tyzden.sk/casopis/16186/som-marxista/ He is one of the most liberal Members in the SMER-SD parliamentary group in relation to minorities' and human rights issues.http://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/273723/pomoze-smer-homosexualom-dedit- po-sebe-im-nestaci/ However, he argues that in the era of neoliberal globalization the Left must be more substantially focused on socio-economic (redistribution of wealth, cooperative ownership, economic democracy) rather than cultural issues. Nevertheless, he supports and often advocates the liberal Left, or the so called New Left. Politically, he supports classic social democracy with its emphasis on economic issues (Old Left), but he also stands in solidarity with the more radical socialist regimes, including Chavez's Venezuela, Castro's Cuba and Morales's Bolivia. He is known to change his positions often, based on what secures him biggest favour from former Prime Minister, Robert Fico. His biggest inspiration is the Scandinavian social model, especially the one in Sweden. He praises particularly the high progressive taxes and worker's project funds (lontagarfondner). In Slovakia, he promotes the cooperative business model such as the Spanish-Basque Mondrag√≥n Cooperative Corporation. He is a foreign policy realist. His opinions are inspired by the school of international political realism (e.g. the ideas of Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer) and neo-Marxism (especially William Robinson, Immanuel Wallerstein and Antonio Negri). He is one of the biggest critics of U.S. foreign policy. He openly criticized not only the war in Iraq, but also the war in Afghanistan. He also criticized the Western involvement in Libya and Syria. He is a critic of the foreign policy of Israel in relation to Palestine.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSH5poR41k0 He advocates for the rights of Armenians in relation to the Nagorno-Karabakh and criticizes Turkish foreign policy. He endorses many of the ideas of Noam Chomsky and Slavoj Zizek. He is one of the greatest defenders of the Russian Federation in Slovakia since the Ukrainian crisis broke out. He is not an apologist for Vladimir Putin's regime, but he perceives the crisis in Ukraine as a geopolitical clash between the West and Russia, and he rejects the one- sided criticism of Russia and the growing Russophobia in Europe. He openly criticized the Sanctions against russia and he describes Russia as a friendly nation that liberated Slovakia from fascism in 1945. Blaha is very critical towards the European Union, but rejects euroscepticism and nationalism. He considers the EU a neoliberal and elitist project, but he does not see a better alternative for Slovakia than the EU. He supports the fight for a different, better, and more social Europe that will be more left-wing and democratic. In the past, he advocated the project of European basic income, he consistently promotes social economy and cooperatives, and strongly advocates for a \\"Social Union\\". He is the most pronounced critic of the TTIP agreement in Slovakia. He was the first Slovak Member of Parliament to visit the so- called \\"TTIP Reading Room\\". He describes the agreement as synonymous with neo- liberalism and the colonization of the European social model by American transnational corporations, and as the Chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic for European Affairs he actively supports its intense scrutiny. During the Greek crisis in 2015, he openly supported Syriza and defended the arguments of Alexis Tsipras and Yanis Varoufakis. After the breaking-up of Syriza and the agreement between Greece and its creditors, he further criticizes the EU for the \\"rape of Greece\\" and for the imposition of a \\"neo-liberal diktat\\". He remains a supporter of Syriza. Blaha opposed mandatory quota proposals during migration crisis. His arguments are based on human rights (not forcing refugees to be settled in countries in which they do not want to live), on tactical thinking (Central European societies are not ready for shock solutions, they need time and sensitive approach), and on political realism (mandatory quotas in these societies would only favor fascists and the political far-right). He has criticized \\"bleeding-heart liberals\\" for their contempt of the people who are afraid of uncontrolled migration, calling them \\"racists\\" and \\"xenophobes\\". However, he strongly refuses and condemns islamophobia and advocates for the solidarity of Slovakia with the EU, be it material, financial or personal. He is the author of the Declaration of the NC SR, in which all Slovak parliamentary groups declared their opposition to the quotas and emphasized other forms of solidarity, systemic solutions and the fight against right-wing extremists taking advantage of the migration crisis. In the 2016 election campaign, he demonstrated his disenchantment with the EU and stressed the four issues which he sees as the main failures of Europe: Greece, Russia, TTIP and the migration crisis. There were other main themes of his election campaign in addition to the criticism of the European Union ‚Äì resistance to capitalism and exploitation; resistance to Western imperialism and propaganda; fight for peace. Blaha espouses socialism, anti-capitalism, alter-globalism and moderate pacifism. Thus, he is marked as \\"communist\\" and \\"Russian agent\\" by critics. In 2018, he became the head of delegation of the National Council of the Slovak Republic to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which elected him as its Vice-President.  Criticism and controversies  Blaha is known for his aggressive, hateful and polarizing posts on social media and spreading disinformation online. International Press Institute condemned his smear Facebook posts targeted against Slovak female journalists. Slovak Academy of Sciences and Academy of the Police Force condemned his posts on social media which go against the ethical code of the institutions. Security company ESET sued Blaha to protect it's reputation. Court ordered Blaha to erase false posts about ESET. He called a special prosecutor a \\"young snot\\" (while falsely claiming the prosecutor was only 25 years old). Before 2020 parliament election, he spread a hoax accusing rival party of voting corruption. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Blaha spread Chinese propaganda and speculated that the virus might be a U.S. biological weapon. As of July 2020, the Slovak police are investigating Blaha under the law that prohibits denying or approving of genocide or crimes against humanity. Blaha had posted on Facebook about \\"lies about murderous communists and innocent victims\\", claiming that the Communist regime had eliminated gangsters and helped ordinary people.

He was arrested in October 1718 and testified against his crew and captain. Battle of Cape Fear River While waiting out the Atlantic hurricane season in the estuary of Cape Fear River, Ignatius took part in a battle between Bonnet's pirate vessel Royal James and two pirate hunters, the Henry and its accompanying sloop, commanded by William Rhett and commissioned by South Carolina governor Robert Johnson (governor). Both sides ran aground, leaving only the Henry in range of the Royal James. Despite the early advantage belonging to the pirates, changing tides freed the Henry first. Realizing they were trapped and outnumbered, Captain Bonnet ordered the gunpowder magazine blown in order to scuttle the Royal James. This order was belayed by the crew and the pirates surrendered to Rhett. Along with the rest of the pirates, Ignatius Pell was arrested and brought to Charleston, South Carolina on October 2, 1718. Trial and testimony Upon arriving in Charleston Pell was separated from the rest of the crew and held in the provost marshal's house alongside Captain Bonnet and the sailing master, David Herriot. However, Bonnet and Herriot soon escaped, leaving Pell behind for unknown reasons. In the manhunt that followed Herriot was killed and Bonnet quickly recaptured, but the event evidently left an impression on Pell. He turned King's evidence and agreed to testify against the crew of the Royal James and against Stede Bonnet personally. In his testimony he confirmed the acts of piracy made by the crew, though he made a point of exonerating a man named Thomas Nichols, claiming he had been pressed into service against his will and did not engage in the fighting. He also stated that Bonnet was captain in name only, the true authority on the Royal James being quartermaster Robert Tucker. He unsuccessfully attempted to argue that Bonnet was therefore not responsible for the acts of piracy his crew had committed. Due in part to Pell's testimony most of the crew (except Nichols) were convicted and sentenced to death. Despite Pell's efforts to mitigate his crimes, Stede Bonnet was also convicted and hanged December 10, 1718. Pell may have returned to piracy: a newspaper article from 1724 reported Pell in command of a 12-gun pirate vessel of his own off the American east coast.

The college was ranked 4th among the colleges of Assam by Career360 in 2016.https://university.careers360.com/articles/top-arts-science-and-commerce- colleges-in-assam-2016 History Debraj Roy College came into being in the wake of independence of the country around 1949. In the post independence period, there was a surging atmosphere of great joy and excitement all over the country and this tempo was also felt in an isolated and sleepy town like Golaghat. There was a craze for higher education among all sections of the people, particularly the students. At that time, there was only one college at Jorhat for the upper Assam region. Higher education was out of reach for the general students of this educationally backward district. This consideration led some spirited persons of the district to establish a college at Golaghat. The institution may be regarded as the brain child of Ayodhya Prasad Goswami, who was a student leader, Biplobi Bir Sankar Baruah, a revolutionary leader of the freedom movement, Golap Ch. Goswami, Dr. Promodaviram Das, Jadunath Saikia, etc. The college was named after the late Debraj Roy, the founder of Bogidhala Tea & Trading Company, Goalghat, in whose memory his son Surendra Nath Ray, the then M.D. of Bogidhala Tea & Trading Company, donated an amount for the construction of the main building of the college.

Childhood  A member of the House of Trastamara, Henry was the third son of King Ferdinand I of Aragon and Eleanor of Alburquerque, 3rd Countess of Alburquerque. His older brothers were King Alfonso V of Aragon and King John II of Navarre but Henry's main estates were in Castile, left to him by his parents. As a child, Infante Henry came to the Castilian royal court, his paternal uncle, King Henry III of Castile, having secured a place for him in the royal council of Henry's five years younger cousin, King John II of Castile. In 1409, Lorenzo Su√°rez de Figueroa, Grand Master of the Order of Santiago, died. Infante Henry was proclaimed the new Grand Master despite being a child of merely nine years. After the death of his aunt, Catherine of Lancaster, Henry aspired to influence his weak cousin John's reign and get a grip on power.  First marriage  In November 1418, Henry married his first cousin, Infanta Catherine of Castile, the sister of King John II of Castile. The marriage was a part of an agreement by which Henry's older brother Alfonso V married Catherine's older sister Maria and by which Henry's sister Maria married Catherine's brother John II. Marriage to the King's sister increased Henry's power even more, to the point that the King began to consider him a threat and started seeking support in √Ålvaro de Luna.  Struggle for power  In 1420, Henry, with the help of some other noblemen, laid siege to the castle in which John II was residing, claiming that the King had been kidnapped by de Luna and demanding the King's surrender. After a few days, however, he lost the support of the noblemen and had to give up. The Infante was arrested and charged with treason and imprisoned in the Castle of Mora. He was released thanks to the efforts of his brother, after which he fled into exile. After √Ålvaro de Luna was disgraced in 1427, Henry regained some of his former power. He and his wife returned to Castile to claim her inheritance and they were successful; having already been granted the Dukedom of Villena by her brother, they received the rest of her dowry. In 1429, his brothers, the King of Aragon and the King of Navarre, declared war on Castile and had the Duke of Villena's support. The war was avoided thanks to their sister Maria's efforts. Henry then had to flee again, this time seeking shelter in the Kingdom of Naples. Alfonso was there fighting for the crown of Naples. Villena was helping Alfonso when he was imprisoned in August 1435 after a battle along with him and their brother John. They were again liberated thanks to the efforts of their sister, the Queen of Castile. His mother died in 1435, having willed her comital title to Henry. The new Count of Alburquerque returned to Castile one last time in 1438, after an uprising of the noblemen. He took part in the uprising and armed conflicts with his brother-in-law.  Second marriage  In October 1439, his wife Catherine died after suffering a miscarriage. Their marriage was childless and her brother confiscated the Dukedom of Villena which he had given to her. Shortly thereafter, the widowed Infante married Beatriz de Pimentel, by whom he had one child: *Henry of Aragon (1445‚Äì1522), 1st Duke of Segorbe, whose granddaughter Anne was the last member of the House of Trastamara. In 1445, Henry took part in the First Battle of Olmedo, helping his brother, the King of Navarre, against their brother-in-law, the King of Castile. According to one theory, the King of Navarre planned to conquer the southern part of the Kingdom of Castile and proclaim Henry its king. However, Henry was wounded and died of infection a few weeks later.

The station is located on the north side of Stouffville Road (York Regional Road 14) on the east side of the railway, west of Highway 404. It features a single platform with heated shelters and a snow-melting system, a station building, a bus loop, a kiss and ride and 850 car parking spaces. The station building has a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver certification. History Historic Gormley station viewed from the south in the early twentieth century =Historic Gormley station= In 1907 a two-storey station was built by the James Bay Railway, south of the original Stouffville Sideroad. The name of the company changed to the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway, and later to the Canadian Northern Railway and was ultimately merged into the Canadian National Railway in 1923. The Gormley railway station was demolished in the early 1970s. Station Road, which once led to station, is now a narrow dead-end street that gives access to a few homes and businesses from Gormley Road. =Gormley GO Station= The Gormley GO Station was constructed north of Stouffville Road, approximately 600 metres north of the site of the historic train station. A ribbon-cutting ceremony for the station was held on 1 December 2016, and regular service began on Monday 5 December 2016. Construction of the station and its building cost approximately million. The station's construction was originally delayed due to environmental concerns, and started in 2014. A nearby layover train storage facility with capacity of six trains was built simultaneously, and cost about million. The layover facility opened in 2014. Services Gormley Station is served by five southbound train trips to Union Station on weekday mornings, and five northbound trips returning to Gormley on weekday evenings. A handful of additional trips between Gormley and Union Station are operated by GO Transit bus route 61 outside of peak periods.

Warrick (October 5, 1924 ‚Äì November 24, 2000), was an American barn painter, best known for his work painting Mail Pouch tobacco advertising on barns across 13 states in the American Midwest and Appalachian states. Over his 55-year career, Warrick painted or retouched over 20,000 Mail Pouch signs. When he retired, he was the last of the Mail Pouch sign painters in America. The Mail Pouch signs have become iconic and some of Harley Warrick's work has been exhibited by the Smithsonian Institution. Though he was not the first or the only Mail Pouch barn painter, he was the most prolific and famous. Featured in newspapers and magazines, traveling to fairs and festivals to demonstrate his skills, Warrick's fame increased appearing on Good Morning America and On the Road with Charles Kuralt. Early life Warrick was born and raised in Londonderry, Ohio, where his family had a dairy farm. When he returned from service in World War II in 1946, he began painting his family's dairy barn with a team of Mail Pouch sign painters; they suggested he join them. Upon reflection, Warrick decided that it would be better than milking his family's Jersey cows each day so he began painting with the team. Having just returned from the Army, Warrick had no other clothes, so he painted barns for the first week in his uniform. It turned out to be the only job he ever had. Mail Pouch career Warrick trained under a seasoned Mail Pouch barn painter, Maurice Zimmerman, who also painted ads for competitor Red Man tobacco, Simoniz car wax, and Minneapolis Milling Company. Warrick and a partner traveled from town to town, sometimes sleeping in the back of a pickup truck or cheap motel. They were often on the road for months at a time. With the partner painting the black background and Warrick painting the letters, they were able to paint two barns a day, taking about six hours per barn. Warrick painted signs in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, Indiana, New York, Illinois, and Michigan. Warrick used no template or tools, painting the sides of barns entirely by eye. He started with the letter 'E' in 'CHEW' and then add the 'W' and then 'CH'. He once said that he always started with the 'H', 'E', and 'W' as those represented his initials. Harley sometimes deliberately misspelled words to see how many phone calls the tobacco company would get about it. He had said that once in a while, he put three 'C's in 'TOBACCO' just to see if anyone noticed. The Highway Beautification Act of 1965, which prohibited advertising billboards within of an interstate highway, effectively ended the era of painting the sides of barns for advertising. Though nearly all other sign painters went out of business, Warrick continued to work for the Swisher International Group, owner of Mail Pouch Tobacco, painting barns along lesser roads and highways until his retirement in 1991. When the Mail Pouch signs were designated as National Historic Landmarks, they were exempted from regulations against tobacco advertising and Warrick continued to paint. Mail Pouch did not suspend the barn painting advertising campaign until Warrick's retirement. Warrick is cited as an influence on Scott Hagan, who is noted for his barn paintings for the Ohio Bicentennial. Personal life Warrick was married twice and had four children. The travel and time away from home put a strain on his first marriage and his wife gave him an ultimatum: either choose her or the job. Warrick said that he must have liked the job better than he liked her, and they parted. After remarrying, he went out only for a week at a time. When he retired, Warrick continued to paint Mail Pouch signs on the sides of barn- shaped bird feeders and mailboxes that he would make and sell in his workshop in Belmont, Ohio. He died in a Wheeling, West Virginia, hospital in November 2000 of an aneurysm.

It is relatively untouched by commercial use, and thus the area has scientific value as a \\"reference site\\" for spruce-fir forests of the Urals. It also supports spawning habitat for trout and grayling. The main rivers are the Usva River (northern border of nature reserve) and the Vilva River (southern border). There are also some small rivers, that have rapids typical of mountain rivers. The reserve is situated in the Gremyachinsk area of Perm Krai. Topography The reserve covers the Basegi Ridge, which runs north-south, and is divided into three sections (Southern, Middle and Northern Basegi) by steep ravines. The Basegi's geology is stable Lower Paleozoic and Proterozoic quartzite, facing the surface, with lesser amounts of granite and diabase. The main rivers are the Usva River (the northern border of the nature reserve) and the Vilva River (southern border). There is also a network of smaller rivers. Climate and ecoregion Basegi is located in the Urals montane tundra and taiga ecoregion, a region that covers the Ural Mountains in a band that is narrow from west- east, but runs up most of the divide between European and Asiatic Russia. The region is a meeting zones of taiga and tundra tree and plant species. The climate of Basegi is Humid continental climate, cool summer (K√∂ppen climate classification Subartic climate(Dfc)). This climate is characterized by mild summers (only 1-3 months above ) and cold, snowy winters (coldest month below ). Flora and fauna There are more than 250 species of plants in the nature reserve, among them more 45 are rare. Many species of mosses and lichens. 50 species of mammals, more than 180 species of birds, 1 species of reptile, 17 species of fish and 3 species of amphibians. Fauna is typical for taiga. Species, protected by Red Data Book of the Russian Federation, include: *Lichens: Lobaria pulmonaria *Plants: Calypso orchid *Invertebrates: clouded Apollo butterfly and others *Fishes: Hucho taimen and others *Birds: golden eagle, Eurasian curlew, white-tailed eagle, peregrine falcon, black stork, Eurasian eagle-owl and others. The reserve has a large community of shrews, of 6 species. In some years, the body mass of shrews can total over 70% of the total weight of vertebrates in the territory. Ecotourism As a strict nature reserve, the Basegi Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There is an 'ecotourist' hiking route to the top of North Basegi Mountain in the reserve, however, that is open to the public. Permits must be obtained in writing in advance.

Originally built for the study of honey bees and apiculture, today it is primarily used to study native pollinator species and the chemicals and pathogens impacting their populations. This academic building is unique in that it is credited as being the first in the United States to be erected exclusively for the teaching of beekeeping. Prior to the construction of the building, the Massachusetts Agricultural College had maintained a beekeeping program for a number of years as one of the first land-grant agricultural colleges to teach the subject in the United States. In time, techniques in apiculture progressed, leaving beekeeping as no longer simply a hobby, but rather a viable agricultural business. The college's program had remained limited to a single short-course for a number of years but was expanded however, when in 1911, a bill passed establishing the office of \\"state apiary inspector\\".G.L. 1911, 220 ¬ß1, Dr. Burton N. Gates, the man first appointed to this position was also the college beekeeping lecturer at the time, and would oversee the expansion of the program as an asset to the college and a service to the state in the years to come. Construction began on the apiary in February 1911 and with its completion in June of the following year for a total cost of $3000. At the time the building contained a laboratory, a wintering cellar, a wood workshop, an office with a comprehensive library of apicultural books, honey and wax extraction rooms and a two-person apartment used by student tenants. It was also the first structure built in the college orchard, a section of campus now known as the Central housing area. (see map) In the time that Gates was there, research focused mainly on honey production, brood diseases, wax extraction and horticultural pollination in the cucumber and cranberry industries. From 1913 to 1920 the laboratory was also operated by a superintendent, John L. Byard, hired on by Gates to maintain the facilities from day to day as well as perform wax extractions and other services to beekeepers from around the state. Following Gates' resignation in 1918, the school ceased to offer its summer beekeeping school, many of its state extension services, and the college went through several different professors before hiring Frank R. Shaw as the new professor of beekeeping in 1931. With Shaw's retirement in 1969, the laboratory was rededicated to urban and medical entomology research, with the former beekeeping program falling into relative obscurity. At the present time the apiary is used exclusively for research on native pollinator decline and ecology, with the last beekeeping classes taught at the university nearly a decade ago.SPIRE Course Listings, 2001, 2002.

History =Origins of the beekeeping program= Beekeeping class on Sunset Avenue, Amherst. The man in the top left corner is instructor James Fitts Wood. c. 1903. Since the early days of its founding as the Massachusetts Agricultural College, UMass Amherst has maintained apiculture and ecological studies of bees throughout much of its history. In 1870 the first short courses on beekeeping were taught at the college by Alonzo Bradley Esq., an expert on honeybee behavior and the president of the Massachusetts Beekeepers' Association at the time. These lectures were given for several of the years that followed and appear to be \\"the first instruction in the subject given in any agricultural college in this country\\" as indicated by H.T. Fernald in his account of the college's history. Only two decades earlier western Massachusetts had been home to Lorenzo Langstroth, a man considered to be the father of modern apiculture. Although he had spent much of his time developing his innovative hive (now considered an international standard) in Philadelphia, in 1852 he moved to Greenfield, Massachusetts to recover from illness and further his study of honeybee behavior. In the following year he published his widely acclaimed primer, The Hive and the Honey-Bee at the Hopkins, Bridgman & Co. press of Northampton.; this book, having gone through several editions since, has become a mainstay of American beekeeping literature. One of Langstroth's own apprentices, James Fitts Wood, would go on to serve as the lecturer of beekeeping at the agricultural college for several years. During this time he continued to make significant contributions in queen-rearing and became known in the apicultural community for developing a strain of notably docile Italian honeybees. Despite his success in academia and apiculture, Wood unfortunately would not live to see the establishment of the college apiary, he died after a period serious illness on February 15, 1905 at the age of 44. =Construction of the apiary= The idea of a campus apiary was first conceived for the sole purpose of pollinating the campus orchard. However, by the time the facilities had been built, President Kenyon L. Butterfield and his administration had seen and realized a much greater purpose and potential in it than was previously considered. Around this time beekeeping was considered a new business venture which had otherwise been thought of as a hobby or side business of farmers for many decades prior. Dr. Burton Noble Gates Just as much of the pioneer work in beekeeping originated in New England, Massachusetts was one of the first states to create a \\"State Inspector of Apiaries.\\" The man who first led UMass's beekeeping program, a Dr. Burton N. Gates, was also the first to fill this position. As the apiary's first professor, he was originally hired part-time to give a series of lectures as a guest speaker during the spring semester of 1906. This would continue until 1910 when the administration hired him as a permanent faculty member, and concurrently built the new apicultural laboratory, equipped with all modern amenities of its time. They saw the opportunity they had, to further research on the diseases and ecology of the honey bee, something that up to that point had never been pursued so thoroughly by a public organization of higher education. In 1911, ground was broken on the site of the \\"old creamery building\\"It is not known if the college used this building or if it was only a remnant of the original farms that once occupied the campus land. Although no detailed photos have been found at the present time, an early yearbook drawing of the creamery may be found on the Wikimedia Commons. at the foot of Mount Pleasant for the new apiary building and yards, and by June of the following year the building had been completed for a total cost of $3000. At the time of its completion, the grounds contained several species of native nectar- yielding flowers and were home to fifty bee colonies of multiple races. The building itself contained wax and honey extraction rooms, a wintering cellar, an office with an extensive library of beekeeping books, a wood workshop, a laboratory and a two-person apartment occupied by student caretakers. As the apiary became a research laboratory, classroom and an extension service to the state, the demand increased for these services and thus it became necessary to maintain additional hives. It is for these reasons that, in 1913, Dr. Gates hired John L. Byard as superintendent of the apiary. Some of Byard's responsibilities included performing wax extractions, running the college's apicultural exhibit at fairs and maintaining the hive yard from day to day. John L. Byard standing in the hive yard, 1915 He would continue to maintain the building, the equipment and the hives until his death in 1920; professors Henry T. Fernald and Arthur I. Bourne would continue his work until his successor arrived the following year. Gates had been promoted from an assistant to an associate professor in 1915, and had continued to work both as a lecturer and as the apiarist of the experimental station. From 1913 to 1914 he was made president of the National Beekeepers' Association, twice hosting conventions in Amherst concluding the college's winter and spring sessions of the college beekeeping school. However, in 1918 he left Amherst for a professorship at the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph, leaving his former position open for the two years that followed.Burton Noble Gates Collection , Archival & Special Collections,University of Guelph Library Gates' and Byard's duties would be taken up by several different people in the next decade. From 1921 to 1923 all beekeeping and apiology work at the Experimental Station was taken up by Professor Norman Phillips, who soon resigned for a job at a commercial apiary. He was replaced by Professor Morton H. Cassidy, an alumnus of the college, who stayed for 3 more years but ultimately had to resign due to his severe asthma. In 1926, a Mr. Clayton L. Farrar was made instructor of beekeeping. Farrar, a graduate of Kansas Agricultural College, also performed extensive work on several entomology projects as a research assistant before leaving in 1931 to work at a Federal laboratory. =Contemporary history= In the span of only a decade the apiary laboratory had been run by 4 different faculty members until finally, in 1931, a new and more permanent apiology instructor, Frank R. Shaw, was hired. Shaw, a student at the time, had previously been hired on in 1930 as assistant entomologist to the college Experimental Station, but with the resignation of Farrar, his responsibilities would shift as he began to teach courses in beekeeping and pollinator ecology. In 1935, he was made an \\"Instructor in Economic Entomology and Beekeeping\\" while concurrently finishing his Ph.D. of entomology at Cornell University. In 1944, Shaw left to serve in the Second World War. Eventually, he would be promoted from being an instructor to an assistant professor in 1954. UMass would continue to offer beekeeping courses and maintain a beekeeping section of the entomology department right up through the 1970s, however it appears there was never another superintendent hired to replace Byard and much of the extension work to state beekeepers seems to have ceased. Professor Shaw went on to coauthor a comprehensive beekeeping and ecology textbook with UC Davis apiologist John Eckert. This textbook,Eckert, John E. & Frank R. Shaw. Beekeeping. Macmillan Publishing Company: New York, NY. intended to replace the beekeeping text of the same name by renowned apiculturalist E. F. Phillips, would be published for a total of seven editions from 1960 through 1977. Shaw retired in 1969 at the age of 61, he would be the first and last \\"Professor of Beekeeping\\" to do so as the position was abolished immediately after. Following his retirement, a student scholarship fund for the department of entomology was set up by the department in Shaw's name.UMass Endowment Funds, 2008 From the late 1970s through the mid-1990s the laboratory was rededicated to medical and urban entomology, with Professor John Edman running projects on mosquitos as vectors and Professor Ron Prokopy focusing on orchard pest control.Letters, postcards, invoices other correspondence found in the building, December 2010 In 1982, the wintering cellar in the basement of the lab was converted into laboratories, and the workshop was relocated to the garage adjacent to the building that was constructed that same year.2009 Buildings Condition Report, page 7 Since 2005, the Apiary has housed part of the Laboratory of Medical Zoology (LMZ) under direction of Dr. Stephen Rich. LMZ uses the lab space for studies of ticks and mosquito vectors of infectious disease. Research The department of entomology has done several studies in apiculture, chemical ecology, horticultural pollination, and the behavior of honeybee and bumblebee colonies. Although some research was done in the apiary yards, the majority of data had to be collected with higher numbers of colonies at different experimental stations. Today the laboratory is used to conduct research on native pollinator decline for the Managed Pollinator Coordinated Agricultural Project. =Selected publications=   Coursework In the decade following the building's construction, multiple courses were taught in apiculture and honeybee behavior. In 1911, there were 20 college-owned bee colonies as well as several lent by the faculty, and a five course program taught in the summer semester at the college. Within five years the college had assembled 50 hives and an extensive collection of apicultural books and equipment. In the year that followed, a summer beekeeping school was held, composed of five courses taught in previous years with the addition of a class in horticulture: > 1. Practical beekeeping. Lectures: laboratory practice in the general work > of the beekeeper; beekeeping equipment, practices in the preparation of > materials, location of the apiary; commencing with bees, handling of bees, > practice in beeyard procedure; spring manipulation, fall preparation, > wintering; extracted honey production; bee diseases and their treatment, > apiary sanitation; making increase, elements of queen rearing, etc. :, > Associate Professor of Beekeeping :, Superintendent of the Apiary 2. Life > of the honeybee. Lectures. :, Professor of Entomology 3. Special problems > of the beekeeper. Lectures: demonstrations in requeening, the races of bees, > the introduction of queens; swarming and handling swarms, comb honey > production, enemies of bees. :, Professor of Veterinary Science 4. Crops > foraged by bees. Lectures: field excursions. :, Director of the Experiment > Station 5. The relation of bees to the pollination of plants, including > coloration, odor, nectar secretion. Lectures: laboratory work in blossom > structure and dissection. :, Associate Professor of Botany 6. Bees in > horticultural practices; fruit production, market gardening, cranberry > culture and greenhouse cucumber growing; beekeeping as affected by spraying > practices. Lectures: field work. :, Associate Professor of Pomology From the 1920s through the 1970s the laboratory was used mainly for faculty and graduate research, with two courses offered to undergraduate students in introductory and advanced beekeeping as well as a single course offered to the public in the summers. There was a brief time in the spring semesters of 2001 and 2002 that an introductory course in beekeeping was offered, however, with the reorganization of the department of entomology these classes have since ceased. Architecture and landscape Apiary (left), and Butterfield (right); a comparison of the Gambrel roofs A portion of a 1912 campus map, with the Apiary visible in the lower right. The laboratory was the first building constructed in the Central housing area, then the campus orchard; the driveway adjacent to the lab would become what is now Clark Hill Road. Although now encompassed by trees and other academic buildings, the apiary was surrounded by fields and orchards at the time of its construction. Early photographs show the hive yard was originally 2 acres in size, extending several hundred feet south of the property's present-day boundaries in what has since been developed into a residential neighborhood. The building itself was built into the side of Mount Pleasant, with the entire east side of its basement completely covered by the ground. This \\"banked barn\\" design was likely used to allow pallets of beehives to be transported with ease from the yards to the wintering cellar, while alternatively making the temperature of the building more easily controlled for their storage. The building currently has two dormers on opposite sides of the roof, but neither seems to be part of the original structure. Older photos as late as 1918 show the roof without any windows implying they were added at some later date.Apiary , YouMass, University of Massachusetts Amherst Being the building's most prominent design feature, the Gambrel roof would later influence Louis Warren Ross, architect and an alumnus of the college, in his design of the Butterfield dormitory which, for a time, was the only other building on the hill. Since the Apiary and Butterfield Hall are the only two buildings on campus to exhibit this architectural motif, it seems likely that this was incorporated in the latter's design to complement the former.

He first distinguished himself in the suppression of a revolt in Epirus in 1339‚Äì1340, where he was subsequently appointed as governor. A relative of the statesman and emperor John VI Kantakouzenos, he took the latter's side in the Byzantine civil war of 1341‚Äì1347 and in late 1342 received the governorship of Thessaly (and possibly Epirus), which he held until his death in 1348. Biography John Angelos was a relative ‚Äì he is variously qualified as a nephew or cousin, with the latter being more likely ‚Äì of John Kantakouzenos,.. the closest friend and associate of Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos (r. 1328‚Äì1341) and later emperor as John VI (r. 1341‚Äì1354).. The names and identities of John's parents are unknown. The only precise information available is that he was the son-in-law of the protovestiarios Andronikos Palaiologos... In his memoirs, John Kantakouzenos states that he himself raised John Angelos and taught him about warfare. John first appears in 1328, when he was governor of the city of Kastoria, and then ca. 1336/7, when he held the post of governor (kephale) of Ioannina with the title of pinkernes.. Ioannina, like most of the lands of the Despotate of Epirus, had been recently annexed by Andronikos III, following the sudden death of the Epirote ruler John II Orsini in 1335 which left Epirus in the weak hands of the young Nikephoros II Orsini and his mother Anna Palaiologina.. Byzantine rule was generally resented by the local populace,. and in 1339 a revolt broke out in Epirus, which quickly gained ground and succeeded in taking a few key fortresses, including the capital, Arta. Later in the same year, John Angelos was sent by Andronikos III along with the governor of Thessaly, Michael Monomachos, as the vanguard of the Byzantine army into Epirus. The emperor himself and Kantakouzenos followed in spring 1340. The rebels avoided a pitched battle and retired to the fortresses, which one by one fell after sieges or through negotiations, so that the region was subdued by the end of the year. John Angelos was appointed as imperial governor of Epirus with his seat at Arta.; ; . John remained in Epirus as governor until the death of Andronikos III in June 1341. He then left his post and travelled with a delegation of high officials to meet with Kantakouzenos at Didymoteichon. With the outbreak of the civil war in early autumn, he sided with Kantakouzenos and was present at the latter's acclamation as emperor at Didymoteichon on 26 October 1341.; ; . In spring 1342, Angelos followed Kantakouzenos in his abortive campaign to Thessalonica and his subsequent flight to Serbia and the court of its ruler Stephen Dushan (r. 1331‚Äì1346)... Later in the year however, the magnates of Thessaly approached Kantakouzenos and offered their support in the war. After the negotiations were successfully concluded, Kantakouzenos issued a chrysobull appointing John Angelos as governor of Thessaly for life. Although Angelos was later raised to the high rank of sebastokrator and enjoyed a measure of autonomy, his authority was circumscribed: the post was not hereditary, and he functioned strictly as the emperor's deputy.; ; . Angelos ruled Thessaly with success. Taking advantage of the decline of the Catalans of the Duchy of Athens, he made gains in the south, and even managed to extend his authority over Epirus and Acarnania as well, where he seized and placed under house arrest Anna Palaiologina, the scheming widow of John II Orsini and sister of Angelos's own wife. His actions, in the midst of the ongoing civil war, gave Kantakouzenos's cause a much-needed boost... In early 1343, he also participated, at the head of a Thessalian cavalry contingent, in Kantakouzenos's failed attempt to take Thessalonica.. John Angelos continued to govern Thessaly (and possibly Epirus and Aetolia-Acarnania as well) until early 1348, when he died of the Black Death, which ravaged Thessaly and Epirus and caused severe depopulation in 1347‚Äì1348.. The Serbs quickly took advantage of this: Epirus fell to the Serbs under Dushan himself in autumn 1347, while Thessaly was taken within a few months after John's death by the Serbian general Gregory Preljub, who became its new governor on behalf of Dushan.; . Family Little is known of John Angelos's family. He married one of the daughters of the protovestiarios Andronikos Palaiologos, a sister to the queen of Epirus Anna Palaiologina. It is unknown if he had any children, although some writers have posited that the brothers known as the \\"Pinkernaioi\\", active in Epirus at the turn of the 15th century, were his descendants..

He is also remembered as John Mortimer's original inspiration for the fictional barrister Horace Rumpole in Rumpole of the Bailey. The son of George Burge, later of Masterton, New Zealand and stepson of Maude Burge, Burge was educated at Cheltenham College, then at Christ's College, Cambridge as an undergraduate commoner. He was called to the Bar from the Inner Temple in 1932.Who Was Who: A Companion to Who's Who, Containing the Biographies of Those who Died, 1981-1990, A. & C. Black, p. 105The London Gazette, issue 43636, Tuesday, 27 April 1965, p. 4127The Law Times and Journal of Property, vol. 196, Office of the Law Times, p. 30, 1943 He practised in the chambers of R. E. Seaton, Q.C., an established \\"criminal set\\" in Queen Elizabeth Building, Temple, London. He succeeded Seaton as Prosecuting Counsel to the Post Office at the Central Criminal Court in 1943. During the Second World War, Burge reached the rank of Squadron Leader in the R.A.F. In 1963, Burge defended Stephen Ward in the Profumo affair, in the course of which Ward was prosecuted for living on earnings from prostitution. Burge, known as a mercurial Old Bailey junior, never quite recovered from the professional consequences of defending him in the scandal. Ward took an overdose of sleeping tablets near the end of the trial, he was found guilty of some charges in his absence, but died without regaining consciousness. It was Burge to whom Mandy Rice-Davies made her famous reply \\"Well he would, wouldn't he?\\" In 1965, Burge was appointed Queen's Counsel; he was made a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1971, and served as a recorder from 1972 to 1975. Author and fellow barrister John Mortimer stated on several occasions that there were elements of Burge, especially Burge‚Äôs independence and total dedication to often unprepossessing clients, that he incorporated into the famous fictional character Rumpole of the Bailey. Mortimer's 2009 obituary in The Daily Telegraph confirmed that Rumpole was, in part, based on a chance meeting in court with James Burge: He died at age 83, on 6 September 1990 and was cremated in X√†bia, Spain. He had married Elizabeth, daughter of Commander Scott Williams, R.N., of Dorset, in 1938; they had two sons and a daughter.

Three Israeli Jewish civilians were killed in the attack.  The attack  On Monday, 12 October 1953, a Palestinian Fedayeen squad infiltrated into Israel from Jordan. The militants reached the Jewish village Yehud, located about east of Tel Aviv, where they threw a grenade into a civilian house. A Jewish woman, Suzanne Kinyas, and her two children (a 3 year old girl and a 1 and a half year old boy) were killed. The tracks of the perpetrators led to the Palestinian village of Rantis, then under the control of Jordan, located about five miles north of Qibya. The attack shocked the Israeli public, both because of the fact that it was the first terror attack committed in the center of Israel and because the victims of the attack were a woman and her infant children, who were killed in their sleep.  Israeli retaliation  Although the Commander of the Arab Legion (as the Jordanian Armed Forces were known at the time), Glubb Pasha, promised that Jordan would catch the perpetrators and bring them to justice, on the morning of October 13 a decision was made by the Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, and the Chief of Staff Mordechai Maklef, deputy chief of staff Moshe Dayan and acting defense minister Pinhas Lavon, of retaliation in response to the Yehud attack. About 130 IDF soldiers participated in the reprisal codenamed Operation Shoshana (after the three- year-old girl killed in the Yehud attack), which was commanded by Ariel Sharon. The IDF force arrived at the village of Qibya, threw grenades and fired through the windows and doors of the houses. Then blew up 45 houses, a school, and a mosque. About 60 civilians, mostly women and children, were killed.Benny Morris, Israel's Border Wars, 1949-1956: Arab Infiltration, Israeli Retaliation and the Countdown to the Suez War, Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 258-9.

The hill fort comprises the slight earthwork remains of a univallate Iron Age hillfort which now nearly ploughed down. Background Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated \\"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction\\".

Comprising Nick Webb (vocals), Joel Roberts (keys) and Mike Dawson (guitar), the rhythm section was James Moir (bass) and Daniel Thorpe (drums), but now that duty is shared between session musicians.  History  Roberts and Webb had been writing and recording music together since the age of 14, having been influenced by a variety of their father's record collections which included many bands from mo-town and progressive rock. The desire of self production started immediately with Robert's garden shed being transformed into a control room but this could only contain a five piece for so long, and eventually they built their own studio in the town centre, which was situated above a curry house and below a tattoo parlour. Having previously been called Fracture (heavy rock), Foxhead and Passengers, the band decided to settle with a synth rock sound and in early 2008 caught the attention of Simon Williams (who had found and released Coldplay and Keane's first material). With Williams the name Capital was decided. They have been tour support for Athlete and The Airborne Toxic Event. Huw Stevens selected them to play at Latitude Festival; and BBC 6 music's invited them in for an interview and plug of their single \\"Bright Lights\\".

It is situated between two other riverfront parks: Centennial Park on the west and River Heritage Park, a new park that is being developed to the east. The park includes monuments, a bandshell. a baseball stadium and it is one of the terminal points for the Davenport Skybridge. The Riverfront Parkway pass through the park. Other features of the park include picnic shelters, horseshoe pits and river access for fishing. Moored off the park‚Äôs levee is a riverboat casino. History LeClaire Park was established on the riverfront during the mayoral administration of C.A. Ficke in the early 1890s. In 1911 the Levee Improvement Commission was created. It was responsible for developing the city‚Äôs riverfront for recreational, industrial and transportation purposes. It was also to beautify the area. The seawall was extended over a period of years from 1912-1931. LeClaire Park was dramatically improved by the commission from 1912-1914. The John Dillon Memorial was added in 1918, the Municipal Natatorium was built in 1923, the W.D. Petersen Music Pavilion was added the following year, the Municipal Inn in 1929 and Municipal Stadium opened in 1931. Privately funded additions included the Lend-A-Hand Club building in 1923, the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Freight House in 1918 and Union Station in 1924. The President Casino was one of the boats that initiated riverboat gambling in Iowa in the early 1990s. The Lend-A-Hand building and the natatorium have subsequently been torn down. John Dillon Memorial Dillon Memorial The memorial to Judge John Forrest Dillon was paid for through a bequest. The fountain was originally built in the middle of Main Street and the Lend-A-Hand Club and the natatorium were built on the east and west sides of the street respectively. In 1997 after the other buildings were torn down Main Street was closed south of River Drive and a plaza was created. W.D. Petersen Music Pavilion Popularly referred to as the LeClaire Park Bandshell, the pavilion was named for William D. Petersen, a promoter of Davenport‚Äôs riverfront in the late 19th and early 20th century. It annually hosts concerts such as the Mississippi Valley Blues Festival, Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival, Festival of Praise as well as other public events. Municipal Inn The concession stand was the work of the Davenport architectural firm of Clausen, Kruse & Klein. It opened in 1929 and is used to mark the major floods on the Mississippi. The flood of 1993 nearly reached the buildings eaves. The structure was listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties. Modern Woodmen Park Modern Woodmen Park The stadium opened as Municipal Stadium on May 26, 1931. It is situated between LeClaire Park on the east and Centennial Park on the west. The name of the stadium was changed to John O‚ÄôDonnell Stadium, after a local sportswriter, in 1971, and to Modern Woodmen Park after the fraternal insurance company of the same name bought the naming rights in 2007. It has been the home for Davenport based minor league baseball teams, including the Davenport Blue Sox and the teams the area has fielded as a member of the Midwest League. The current team to occupy the stadium is the Quad City River Bandits. It was also the home field for the St. Ambrose University and Assumption High School athletic programs.

It was designed by Atelier LWD, an architecture studio led by Guy Lagneau, Michel Weill and Jean Dimitrijevic. It is named after Andr√© Malraux, Minister of Culture when the museum was opened in 1961. History Architect Guy Lagneau was chosen by Georges Salles, director of National Museums, to undertake construction between 1952 and 1961 of the first major museum built in France after World War II. Lagneau undertook the work in collaboration with Raymond Audigier, Michel Weill and Jean Dimitrejvic. The museum, inaugurated in 1961 by the Minister of Culture, Andr√© Malraux, was one of the key elements of the reconstruction of Le Havre. The museum was recently renovated by Emmanuelle and Laurent Beaudouin. Structure The museum departs from the tradition of closed museums, designed by Lagneau in close cooperation with curator Reynold Arnoult to develop a flexible space in harmony with the marine environment. Facing the sea, the museum is a smooth and transparent assembly of glass and steel posed on a concrete pad. Installed above the roof, the aluminum louver blades were created by the engineer Jean Prouv√©, providing control over the natural light that floods the building. Le Signal,http://www.muma- lehavre.fr/en/collections/artworks-in-context/sculpture/the-signal/henri- georges-adam a concrete sculpture by Henri Georges Adam, frames a fragment of the landscape and strongly emphasizes the exceptional situation of the building at the harbor entrance. The large windows of the Malraux museum let in the highly variable light of the Normandy coast, a light that inspired many of the painters in the museum's collections. Interior view of the museum The light is carefully filtered before flooding inside the building. To the east, opal glass panes attenuate the rays of the morning sun. The facade to the west has three levels of filtration: a wall of glass screens on which horizontal lines have been printed intersects with the vertical lines of pivoted louvers, creating a grid of variable density. When light rays enter horizontally, blinds complete this scheme. On the ceiling, translucent square tiles filter the light reflected by the louver installed above the roof. Inclined blades break the sun and deliver a soft luminosity to the heart of the building. Collection The museum houses a collection of art spanning the past five centuries, with the impressionist painting collection being the second most extensive in France after that of the Orsay Museum in Paris. There are paintings by Claude Monet and other artists who lived and worked in Normandy. There are paintings by Camille Corot, Eug√®ne Boudin (with the largest collection of his works in the world), Eug√®ne Delacroix, Gustave Courbet, Edgar Degas, √âdouard Manet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Gauguin, Alfred Sisley, Camille Pissarro, Paul S√©rusier and √âdouard Vuillard. Modern art is also well represented with works by artists such as Henri Matisse, Albert Marquet, Raoul Dufy, Kees van Dongen, Fernand L√©ger, Alexej von Jawlensky and Nicolas de Sta√´l. There is also an old masters section displaying paintings of Hendrik ter Brugghen, Jos√© de Ribera, Simon Vouet, Luca Giordano, Francesco Solimena, Hubert Robert, John Constable and Th√©odore G√©ricault.http://www.muma-lehavre.fr/en/collections/oeuvres-commentees The collection of Olivier Senn (1864‚Äì1959), given to the museum in 2004, contains more than 205 paintings and many drawings by great masters of impressionism and modern art. Thanks to the donations, MuMa's collection of Impressionist works is today one of France's largest, and the public can now enjoy works by Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley, Degas, Courbet and Corot. =Gallery= File:MuMA - Monet - Soleil d'hiver √† Lavacourt.jpgClaude Monet, Soleil d'hiver √† Lavacourt (1879-1880) File:MuMA - Gauguin - Paysage de Te Vaa.JPGPaul Gauguin, Paysage de Te Vaa (1896) File:MuMA - Corot - Dunkerque, remparts et porte d'entr√©e du port.JPGJean-Baptiste Camille Corot, Dunkerque, remparts et porte d'entr√©e du port (1873) File:Monet-Nymph√©as-Le-Havre.jpgClaude Monet, Les Nymph√©as (1906) File:MuMA - Guillaumin - Paysage de neige √† Crozant.JPGArmand Guillaumin, Paysage de neige √† Crozant (vers 1895) File:MuMA - S√©rusier - Le berger Corydon.JPGPaul S√©rusier, Le Berger Corydon (1913) File:Boudin-Barques-LeHavre.jpgEug√®ne Boudin, Etude pour des barques de p√™che File:Desportes-Gibier-Le-Havre.jpgAlexandre-Fran√ßois Desportes, Nature morte aux fruits et au gibier File:Eug√®ne Boudin, Entr√©e des jet√©es du Havre par gros temps, 1895.jpgEug√®ne Boudin, Entr√©e des jet√©es du Havre par gros temps (1895) File:Edouard Dantan Enterrement d'un enfant √† Villerville.jpg √âdouard Joseph Dantan, Enterrement d'un enfant √† Villerville (1884) File:Etude de ciel, boudin.jpgEug√®ne Boudin, Coucher de soleil au bord de la mer (circa 1888-1895) File:Vuillard-Fen√™tre-LeHavre.jpg√âdouard Vuillard, A la fen√™tre File:Stoskopff-Nature-morte1-LeHavre.jpgS√©bastien Stoskopff, Nature morte aux fruits, fromage et pain File:Hubert Robert - The Fire of Rome - Google Art Project.jpgHubert Robert, The Fire of Rome, 18 July 64 AD File:Eug√®ne Boudin 001.jpgLouis-Eug√®ne Boudin, Dusk over the port of Le Havre File:Hendrik ter Brugghen - De Roeping van Sint Mattheus.jpgHendrik ter Brugghen, The Calling of St. Matthew, File:Monet-F√©camp-LeHavre.JPGClaude Monet, F√©camp, bord de mer (1881) File:La Vague, Gustave Courbet.jpgGustave Courbet, The Wave (1869) File:Les vaches boudin.jpgEug√®ne Boudin, Landscape with Cows (1881) File:Sisley la seine au point du jour 1877.jpgAlfred Sisley, La Seine au point du jour (1877) File:Edgar Degas - After the bath, woman drying herself - Google Art Project.jpgEdgar Degas, After the Bath, Woman Drying Herself (c. 1884‚Äì1886, reworked between 1890 and 1900) References Sources  * Art museums and galleries in France Buildings and structures in Le Havre Museums in Seine- Maritime Art museums established in 1961 1961 establishments in France ","title":"Museum of modern art Andr√© Malraux - MuMa"},{"id":"31275393","text":"Skaun Church (, historically: Venn kirke) is a parish church in Skaun municipality in Tr√∏ndelag county, Norway.

Archaeology career Gopher's work at Qesem with Ran Barkai and Israel Hershkowitz received considerable press coverage. The team claimed to have discovered the oldest homo sapiens remains ever found at the cave near Rosh HaAyin in central Israel. Their paper, published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, states that the human teeth they discovered are between 400,000 and 200,000 years old although it was impossible to definitely identify the particular species of human. In an interview, Gopher said \\"they definitely leave all options open. There's been a tendency for people to get so accustomed to the \\"out of Africa\\" hypothesis that they use it exclusively and explain any finding that doesn't fit it as evidence of yet another wave of migration out of Africa.\\" Gopher and agronomist Shahal Abbo of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have written a book that challenges the scientific consensus over the domestication of wild plants. They contend that the process of domestication was rapid, well-planned and organized, and that several plant species were domesticated in a single location.Israeli Researchers Trying to Force a Major Rethink of Prehistoric Agriculture in Area, Haaretz Fieldwork * 1977-1980 - Excavations with Prof. Ofer Bar-Yosef and Prof. Nigel Goring-Morris of projects in the southern Sinai such as Abu Madi. * 1979 - Excavations at Qadesh Barnea 3 and Negev Highlands. * 1977-1979 - Excavations at Hayonim Cave, Galilee, directed by Prof. Ofer Bar-Yosef. * 1980-1981 - Excavations at Nahal Issaron, Uvda Valley, co-director with Prof. Nigel Goring-Morris. * 1980-1981 - Excavations at Negev Highlands Project co- director with Prof. Nigel Goring-Morris. * 1982 - Excavations at Ain Qadeis, co-director with Prof. S.A.

Tell es- Sultan (, lit. - Sultan's Hill) also known as Tel Jericho () or Ancient Jericho, is the site of ancient and biblical Jericho and today a UNESCO- nominated archaeological site in the West Bank, located two kilometres north of the centre of Jericho. The tell was inhabited from the 10th millennium BCE, and has been called \\"the oldest town in the world\\", with many significant archaeological finds; the site is also notable for its role in the history of Levantine archaeology. History =Natufian hunter-gatherers, 10,000 BCE= The first permanent settlement on the site developed between 10,000 and 9000 BCE. During the Younger Dryas period of cold and drought, permanent habitation of any one location was impossible. However, Tell es-Sultan was a popular camping ground for Natufian hunter-gatherer groups due to the nearby Ein as- Sultan spring; these hunter-gatherers left a scattering of crescent-shaped microlith tools behind them. Around 9600 BCE the droughts and cold of the Younger Dryas stadial came to an end, making it possible for Natufian groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year-round habitation and permanent settlement. Epipaleolithic construction at the site appears to predate the invention of agriculture, with the construction of Natufian structures beginning earlier than 9000 BC, the very beginning of the Holocene epoch in geologic history.Freedman et al., 2000, p. 689‚Äì671. =Pre- Pottery Neolithic, 8500 BCE= Dwelling foundations unearthed at Tell es- Sultan in Jericho Ancestor Statue, Jericho, c. 9000 BC (Replica). Israel Museum. :Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) The Pre-Pottery Neolithic A phase at Tell es-Sultan (ca. 8500 ‚Äì 7500 BCE) saw the emergence of one of the world's first major proto-cities. As the world warmed up, a new culture based on agriculture and sedentary dwelling emerged, which archaeologists have termed \\"Pre-Pottery Neolithic A\\" (abbreviated as PPNA), sometimes called the Sultanian era after the town. PPNA villages are characterized by small circular dwellings, burial of the dead under the floor of buildings, reliance on hunting wild game, the cultivation of wild or domestic cereals, and no use of pottery yet. The PPNA-era town, a settlement of around , contained round mud-brick houses, yet no street planning. Circular dwellings were built of clay and straw bricks left to dry in the sun, which were plastered together with a mud mortar. Each house measured about across, and was roofed with mud- smeared brush. Hearths were located within and outside the homes. The identity and number of the inhabitants of Jericho during the PPNA period is still under debate, with estimates going as high as 2000‚Äì3000, and as low as 200‚Äì300.\\"Jericho\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica It is known that this population had domesticated emmer wheat, barley and pulses and hunted wild animals. The town was surrounded by a massive stone wall over high and wide at the base (see Wall of Jericho), inside of which stood a stone tower (see Tower of Jericho), placed in the centre of the west side of the tell.Ran Barkai and Roy Liran. Midsummer Sunset at Neolithic Jericho. In Time and Mind: The Journal of Archaeology, Consciousness and Culture, Volume 1‚ÄîIssue 3, November 2008, p. 279. DOI 10.2752/175169708X329345 This tower was the tallest structure in the world until the Pyramid of Djoser, and the second-oldest tower after the one at Tell Qaramel. The wall and tower were built around 8000 BCE.O'Sullivan, Arieh., World‚Äôs first skyscraper sought to intimidate masses, Jerusalem Post, 14 February 2011 For the tower carbon dates published in 1981 and 1983 indicate that it was built around 8300 BCE and stayed in use until ca. 7800 BC. The wall and tower would have taken a hundred men more than a hundred days to construct, thus suggesting some kind of social organization and division of labour. The major structures highlight the importance of the Tell for the understanding of settlement patterns in the Sultanian period in the southern Levant. :Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) After a few centuries, the first settlement was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase there was a settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the tell. This second settlement, established in 6800 BCE, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten plastered human skulls, painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features.Ring et al., 1994, p. 367‚Äì370. These represent either teraphim or an early example of portraiture in art history, and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.Janson and Janson, 2003. The architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumb prints to facilitate bounding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room () and a second slightly smaller room () containing internal divisions. The remaining areas are small, and presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish terrazzo-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors. Kathleen Kenyon interpreted one building as a shrine. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fit into this niche. The dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A skull cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; cowries were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in Tell Ramad and Beisamoun as well. Other finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side- notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, burins, scrapers, a few tranchet axes, obsidian, and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also querns, hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, anthropomorphic and theriomorphic clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads. =Bronze Age= The Seven Trumpets of Jericho (watercolor circa 1896‚Äì1902 by James Tissot) depicting the Israelites carrying the Ark of the Covenant in the initial conquest of Canaan :This section deals with the archaeology of Bronze Age Jericho; for the Biblical battle, see Battle of Jericho A succession of settlements followed from 4500 BCE onward, the largest constructed in 2600 BCE. Tell es-Sultan was continually occupied into the Middle Bronze Age; it was destroyed in the Late Bronze, after which it no longer served as an urban centre. The city was surrounded by extensive defensive walls strengthened with rectangular towers, and possessed an extensive cemetery with vertical shaft- tombs and underground burial chambers; the elaborate funeral offerings in some of these may reflect the emergence of local kings. During the Middle Bronze Age Tell es-Sultan was a small prominent city of the Canaan region, reaching its greatest Bronze Age extent in the period from 1700 to 1550 BCE. It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the Maryannu, a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the Mitannite state to the north. Kathleen Kenyon reported \\"...the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna'an. ... The defenses ... belong to a fairly advanced date in that period\\" and there was \\"a massive stone revetment... part of a complex system\\" of defenses (pp. 213‚Äì218).Kenyon, Kathleen \\"Digging up Jericho\\"(London, 1957) The Bronze-Age city fell in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, the calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer dating to 1617‚Äì1530 BCE. Notably this carbon dating 1573 BCE confirmed the accuracy of the stratigraphical dating 1550 by Kenyon. =Iron Age= Tell es-Sultan remained unoccupied from the end of the 15th to the 10th-9th centuries BCE, when the city was rebuilt. Of this new city not much more remains than a four-room house on the eastern slope. By the 7th century Jericho had become an extensive town, but this settlement was destroyed in the Babylonian conquest of Judah in the late 6th century. =Abandonment of the Tell= After the destruction of the Judahite city by the Babylonians in the late 6th century, whatever was rebuilt in the Persian period as part of the Restoration after the Babylonian captivity, left only very few remains. The tell was abandoned as a place of settlement not long after this period. Archaeological excavation Plastered Skull, Tell es-Sultan, Jericho, c. 9000 BC The first excavations of the site were made by Charles Warren in 1868 at the request of the Palestine Exploration Fund. He dug through the mud bricks of the wall without realizing what it was, suggesting there was little of interest at the site. Ernst Sellin and Carl Watzinger excavated Tell es- Sultan and Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq between 1907‚Äì1909 and in 1911, finding the remains of two walls which they initially suggested supported the biblical account of the Battle of Jericho. They later revised this conclusion and dated their finds to the Middle Bronze Age (1950-1550 BC). The site was again excavated by John Garstang between 1930 and 1936, who again raised the suggestion that remains of the upper wall was that described in the Bible, and dated to around 1400 BCE. Extensive investigations using more modern techniques were made by Kathleen Kenyon between 1952 and 1958. Her excavations discovered a tower and wall in trench I. Kenyon provided evidence that both constructions dated much earlier than previous estimates of the site's age, to the Neolithic, and were part of an early proto-city. Her excavations found a series of seventeen early Bronze Age walls, some of which she thought may have been destroyed by earthquakes. The last of the walls was put together in a hurry, indicating that the settlement had been destroyed by nomadic invaders. Another wall was built by a more sophisticated culture in the Middle Bronze Age with a steep plastered escarpment leading up to mud bricks on top. Lorenzo Nigro and Nicolo Marchetti conducted excavations in 1997-2000.

Along with the Trondheim and Troms√∏ bids, it was one of three options for the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports (NIF), who ultimately chose to not bid for the games. Oslo announced the bid in September 2006, and the official proposal report was published in February 2007. Compared to the other Norwegian bids, Oslo‚ÄìLillehammer presented the best infrastructure, transport and accommodation. The bid called for using existing venues for Alpine, Nordic and freestyle skiing, snowboarding, curling and sliding sports, although new venues would need to be built for ice hockey and skating. Major existing venues which would be used included Holmenkollen National Arena, Tryvann Vinterpark and Jordal Amfi in Oslo, and Hafjell, Kvitfjell and Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track in the Lillehammer area. All venues would be accessible by rail, including most of the Oslo venues by the Oslo Metro. The main Olympic Village would be built in Bj√∏rvika and the media center in Lohavn. The bid's major downside was the distance between Oslo and Kvitfjell. The choice of those venues over Norefjell was subject to criticism and debate. Political support for Oslo was lower than for Troms√∏, as the authorities prioritized regional policies in their support for candidates. Background Norway has hosted two Winter Olympics, the 1952 Games in Oslo and the 1994 Games in Lillehammer. Oslo has applied four times previously to host the games, in 1932, 1944, 1952 and 1968. A proposal was also made for Oslo to bid for 1980, but the application was never sent. In 2002, the five municipalities that had hosted the 1994 Olympics stated their intent to apply for the 2014 Winter Olympics. They hoped a new Olympics would stimulate the Oppland and Hedmark region, and focused on the reuse of the existing venues. At the same time, officials from Oslo also stated that they intended to bid for the same or later games. Ahead of the bids for the 2014 Winter Olympics, Troms√∏ launched a proposal. It was seen both as a possibility to develop Northern Norway, and a way to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution of Norway. The proposal was rejected by the Bondevik's Second Cabinet, who stated that there should be more than 20 years between each time Norway hosted the Olympics. They were also concerned about the costs of the project. The opposition supported the Troms√∏ bid, stated it was important for regional development. Gerhard Heiberg, Norway's representative in the International Olympic Committee (IOC), described the project as unrealistic and that a better application would be needed to compete with bids such as Sochi's. The application was finally dismissed by the NIF board in July 2005. On 23 June 2006, the NIF board announced that they planned to apply for the 2018 Winter Olympics, and asked for bids from Norwegian cities wanting to host the games. Oslo city councilor Anette Wiig Bryn announced on 25 August that Oslo planned to bid for the 2018 Olympics. It was the third city to announce it would apply to become the Norwegian applicant for the games, after both Troms√∏ and Trondheim had previously made announcements. The planning was given a municipal grant of 6 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Oslo Mayor Per Ditlev- Simonsen stated that the Oslo bid would include Norefjell rather than the Lillehammer venues. The Oslo and Lillehammer cooperation was announced on 13 September. Venues and infrastructure Holmenkollbakken was proposed to be used for ski jumping. Jordal Amfi, then an outdoor rink, was used during the 1952 Olympics, and was proposed to be used for the curling events in 2018. R√•dhusplassen, with the Oslo City Hall in the background, was proposed as the venue for the opening, closing and medal ceremonies. Holmenkollen National Arena was completely rebuilt ahead of the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011. It features the large ski jumping hill Holmenkollbakken and the normal hill Midtstubakken, along with a cross-country skiing stadium. The large hill and the stadium were both used during the 1952 Olympics.Oslo Municipality (2007): 16 Cross-country sprint were planned located at T√∏yen Park.Oslo Municipality (2007): 19 Biathlon was planned to be located at Lillomarka, where a multi-sport venue was planned built.Oslo Municipality (2007): 17 The snowboard and freestyle events are planned split between Wyllerl√∏ypa, part of Tryvann Vinterpark, and Grefsenkleiva, part of Oslo Skisenter. Both are existing recreational areas for Alpine skiing and snowboard and within the city. Wyllerl√∏ypa was used during the 1952 Olympics for slalom. Jordal Amfi was the only existing ice rink proposed for the Olympics. It was built as an outdoor venue for ice hockey at the 1952 Winter Olympics. The venue would need a major upgrade to be suitable the 2018 Games, for which it was planned to host curling. Valle Hovin was at the time of the application an outdoor speed skating rink. Independent of the Olympic application, plans exist to rebuild it as an indoor venue. Oslo Podium was primarily planned as a national stadium for handball, for which Norway several times has hosted world and European championships, and for which Oslo lacks a suitable venue. It was planned to be located at Hasle and built independent of Oslo hosting the Winter Olympics, but the plans for the venue were canceled in 2009, after the Norwegian Handball Federation had not made up their mind, and Oslo Municipality needed the lot for a school. The venue would have been owned by the federation. Two more new ice rinks were planned, at Stubberud and Mortensrud. The former would feature ice hockey, while the latter would host figure skating and short-track speed skating.Oslo Municipality (2007): 18 Three venues would be located in the Lillehammer area; all three of them were used during the 1994 Winter Olympics. Hafjell would have hosted the slalom and giant slalom tournaments, while Kvitfjell would feature downhill and super-G. Both are regularly used in the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup and Kvitfjell is part of Club 5+. Kvitfjell would need a new downhill course. If IOC requirements changed so a single arena for all Alpine sports was needed, the technical disciplines could be moved from Hafjell to Kvitfjell. Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track, located at Hunderfossen, would feature bobsleigh, luge and skeleton. The track is the only one in Northern Europe. The main Olympic Village would be located in Bj√∏rvika, on waterfront property in downtown Oslo. In addition, a smaller Olympic village would be built in Hafjell. The Oslo village would have 3,000 rooms and 4,500 beds, while the Hafjell Village would have 700 rooms and 1,000 beds. As of 2007, the Oslo region has 10,500 hotel beds and the Lillehammer area 3,200 beds, most of which would be rented by the organizing committee. Additional accommodation capacity could be generated by using 50,000 beds in cabins and rental apartments in the Lillehammer area and 10,000 hotel beds in a distance of from the venues, and the use of cruise ships docked at the Port of Oslo.Oslo Municipality (2007): 15 The media center and international broadcasting center were to be located at Lohavn, with media accommodation being located at Lohavn and Filipstad. All Oslo accommodation and media facilities are part of the Fjord City project. Opening, closing and medal ceremonies in Oslo would be held at R√•dhusplassen, a square in the city center. In Lillehammer, the medal ceremonies would have been located at Stortorget, the main square in the town. {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" +List of venuesOslo Municipality (2007): 20 ! scope=col  Venue ! scope=col  Sports ! scope=col  Status ! scope=col  Previous ! scope=col  Capacity - ! scope=row  Grefsenkleiva  Freestyle, snowboard  New  align=center  ‚Äî  align=right  14,000 - ! scope=row  Hafjell  Alpine skiing  Existing  1994  align=right  35,000 - ! scope=row  Holmenkollen National Arena  Nordic skiing  Existing  1952  align=right  50,000 - ! scope=row  Kvitfjell  Alpine skiing  Existing  1994  align=right  40,000 - ! scope=row  Jordal Amfi  Curling  Existing  1952  align=right  4,000 - ! scope=row  Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track  Bobsleigh, luge, skeleton  Existing  1994  align=right  15,000 - ! scope=row  Lillomarka  Biathlon  New  align=center  ‚Äî  align=right  40,000 - ! scope=row  Mortensrud  Figure skating, short-track speed skating  New  align=center  ‚Äî  align=right  12,000 - ! scope=row  Oslo Podium  Ice hockey  New  align=center  ‚Äî  align=right  10,000 - ! scope=row  R√•dhusplassen  Ceremonies  Existing  align=center  ‚Äì  align=right  30,000 - ! scope=row  Stortorget (Lillehammer)  Ceremonies  Temporary  align=center  ‚Äî  align=center  ‚Äî - ! scope=row  Stubberud  Ice hockey  New  align=center  ‚Äì  align=right  8,000 - ! scope=row  T√∏yen Park  Cross-country spring  Temporary  align=center  ‚Äî  align=right  40,000 - ! scope=row  Valle Hovin  Speed skating  New  align=center  ‚Äî  align=right  10,000 - ! scope=row  Wyllerl√∏ypa  Freestyle, snowboard  Existing  1952  align=right  14,000 } The location of the venues was such that all sites in Oslo would be located on the Oslo Metro or the Oslo Tramway, and the Lillehammer venues would all be located on the Dovre Line. Athletes, officials and VIPs would be transported using buses and dedicated cars on closed-off roads. Oslo's public transport system transported at the time of the application 500,000 people per day, with large vacant capacity between the rush hours.Oslo Municipality (2007): 10 Transport between Oslo and the Lillehammer area would be done using railway, as well as European Route E6 and National Road 4Oslo Municipality (2007): 13 In 2007, travel time by train from Oslo to Lillehammer was 125 minutes, to Hafjell and Hunderfossen 140 minutes, and to Kvitfjell 168 minutes.Oslo Municipality (2007): 14 Oslo Airport, Gardermoen is located between Oslo and Lillehammer; the Airport Express Train has a travel time of 19 minutes to Oslo Central Station, while the regional train uses 105 minutes to Lillehammer. Sandefjord Airport, Torp and Moss Airport, Rygge can both be used as reserve airports. The application states that Oslo plans to build the venues in places were they can be used for recreation after the games. Hafjell, Kvitfjell, Tryvann and Grefsen are privately owned, and for these, commercial operations will resume also after the Olympics. The placement of the venues is part of the municipality's strategy to decrease the differences between the East End and West End of Oslo.Oslo Municipality (2007): 21‚Äì22 Evaluation and outcome Therese Johaug during the women's 30 km at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011 The Oslo bid was one of three submitted to NIF, along with Trondheim and Troms√∏. The three bids were evaluated, based on the same criteria that IOC uses to evaluate bids, by a committee led by Odd Martinsen. They concluded that Oslo was the most suited, followed by Trondheim and Troms√∏. The decision for a Norwegian applicant was taken by the NIF board on 30 March 2007. In the first round of voting, only Geir Kvillum voted for Trondheim. In the following round, both Oslo and Troms√∏ received six votes, and President Odd-Roar Thorsen received the decisive vote. The bid for Troms√∏ was later discarded by NIF; three independent reports all concluded that the town was not suited to host the games, in particular because of lack of suitable transport, accommodation and post-Olympic use of venues. {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" + Voting outcome ! scope=col  City ! scope=col  Round 1 ! scope=col  Round 2 - ! scope=row  Troms√∏  6  6 - ! scope=row  Oslo  5  6 - ! scope=row  Trondheim  1  align=center  ‚Äî } One controversial part of the Oslo bid was the choice of Hafjell and Kvitfjell over Norefjell for Alpine skiing. Norefjell was used for downhill during the 1952 Olympics, and is significantly closer to Oslo than Hafjell and Kvitfjell. Per Ditlev-Simonsen stated that he and the committee originally planned to bid with Norefjell, but that Gerhard Heiberg had recommended that Oslo instead bid with Hafjell and Kvitfjell. IOC President Jacques Rogge later stated that with the distance of between Oslo and the Alpine venues would make it impossible to be selected. In a documentary made by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, it was stated that Heiberg was in favor of the Troms√∏ bid, and recommended Oslo to bid with Hafjell and Kvitfjell to reduce their chances of being selected national candidate. Following the Nordic World Ski Champions held at Holmenkollen in 2011, the debate about Norway hosting the Olympic Games surfaced again. Martin Rimpi, project leader for Troms√∏ 2018, stated after the world championships that it was unlikely that Troms√∏ would be a future candidate. He also stated that if a high-speed railway was built between Oslo and Lillehammer, travel time between the towns would be short enough for IOC to accept a bid.

The lyrics evoke the peaceful Russian countryside, the memory of the millions of lives lost in the Second World War, and the friendly meeting of U.S. and Soviet soldiers on Elbe Day. Russian postage stamp issued in 1999 to commemorate the singer Mark Bernes. The song was first performed by Mark Bernes, who had collaborated with Kolmanovski before. Upon first hearing the song in a recording studio, Bernes disliked the melody and persuaded Kolmanovski to rewrite the music. Bernes performed the song in public on the eve of the 22nd party conference of the Soviet Communist Party in 1961. The following year, delegates to the World Congress for Peace and Disarmament in Moscow received a phonograph record of \\"Do the Russians Want War?\\" sung in English, French, German, and Spanish translations. The song was also sung at the 1962 World Festival of Youth and Students in Helsinki. These two events helped popularize the song around the world. In 1967 the Alexandrov Ensemble performed \\"Do the Russians Want War?\\" on a tour of Italy, Belgium, France, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Just before a performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London, local authorities requested that the ensemble not perform the song, which some Britons regarded as communist propaganda. The ensemble objected to the request and the song was included in the concert program. External links * Mark Bernes: Do the Russians Want War?

City of Torrington, DC, 595 F.Supp. 1521 (1985) was a court decision concerning Tracey Thurman, a Connecticut homemaker who sued the city police department in Torrington, Connecticut, claiming a failure of equal protection under the law against her abusive husband Charles \\"Buck\\" Thurman, Sr. Case In 1982, Tracey Thurman left her husband Charles \\"Buck\\" Thurman after a brief but violent marriage. She took with her their only child, Charles Jr. For eight months, the couple lived apart while Buck harassed Tracy and verbally threatened to kill her. In November 1982, Buck forcibly entered the home Tracey was staying at and removed Charles Jr. Charles Jr. was returned to his mother, but the police refused to accept a complaint of criminal trespass from the homeowner. Four days later, Buck stood in front of Tracey's car on a public street and verbally threatened her. Although there was a police officer nearby, he did not intervene until Buck broke the windshield of Tracey's car with his fist. Buck was convicted of breach of the peace and received a six month suspended sentence with a two year conditional discharge. He was ordered to stay away from Tracey, but within weeks, Buck resumed threatening Tracey. Tracey reported this behavior to police, but no effort was made to arrest Buck. Between January and May of 1983, Buck made numerous threats to Tracey, violating the court order. She reported these threats to police, but no action was taken. On five separate occasions in May 1983, Tracey appeared at the Torrington Police Station requesting the arrest of her husband due to his repeated threats of violence. The police gave Tracey various excuses for their inaction including \\"the officer who has your case is on vacation.\\" On May 6, 1983, Tracey filed for and was granted a restraining order against Buck. On June 10, 1983, Buck arrived at the house Tracey was staying at and demanded to see her. Tracey remained inside and contacted the police. Fifteen minutes later, with no officer in sight, Tracey exited the house to speak to Buck. Twenty five minutes after Tracey's call a single officer arrived. The officer sat in his car while Buck chased Tracey, grabbed her by the hair and stabbed her over twenty times. The officer eventually exited the car and took the knife from Buck, but he made no effort to arrest him. While the officer watched, Buck kicked Tracey in the head several times, breaking her neck. Buck then ran into the house, grabbed Charles Jr. and brought him outside. Buck dropped Charles Jr. on Tracey's limp body and once again kicked her in the head. Roughly forty minutes after the police arrived, Tracey was loaded into an ambulance. Buck threatened Tracey one more time and was finally arrested. Buck was convicted of assault and sentenced to 20 years, but served less than eight years in prison. Tracey Thurman spent eight months in the hospital. She is partially paralyzed to this day. The case was brought by attorney Burton M. Weinstein, well known for his work involving police misconduct, and his associate Judith A. Mauzaka. When the lawsuit was filed in 1984, Tracey Thurman became the first woman in America to individually sue a town and its police department for violating her civil rights, claiming the police had ignored the violence because she was married to the perpetrator.http://articles.courant.com/1992-03-15/news/0000204455_1_domestic- violence-domestic-abuse-family-violence-prevention The case was allowed to proceed in a ruling by Senior Judge M. Joseph Blumenfeld (who had been appointed to the bench by President Kennedy in 1961) New York Times url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/06/obituaries/m-joseph-blumenfeld- judge-84.html. The claim survived a Motion to Dismiss which asserted that it had not asserted a constitutionally based claim of a violation of equal protection. The claim was that either by practice and custom, or the custom over months of failing to address the complaints of a single victim of domestic violence, that the plaintiff as a woman and victim of domestic violence was being afforded differential treatment than other victims of violence, hence making a viable constitutional claim for damages. The Motion to Dismiss was denied, the case was allowed to proceed.https://cyber.harvard.edu/vaw00/thurmanexcerpt.html The district court found that \\"a pattern of affording inadequate protection, or no protection at all, to women who have complained of being abused by their husbands... is tantamount to an administrative classification used to implement the law in a discriminatory fashion.\\" Tracey Thurman was awarded $2.3 million,http://articles.courant.com/1992-03-15/news/0000204455_1_domestic- violence-domestic-abuse-family-violence-prevention but eventually settled for $1.9 million when the city agreed to forgo an appeal. Legacy The Thurman lawsuit brought about sweeping national reform of domestic violence laws, including the \\"Thurman Law\\" (aka the Family Violence Prevention and Response Act) instituted in Connecticut in 1986, which mandates police make arrests in domestic violence cases even if the victim does not wish to press charges. The large financial penalty against the City of Torrington in the Thurman case was widely reported in the popular press and in academic journals. Police departments were forced by financial fear to change how they handled domestic violence. Tracey Thurman's story was later made into a 1989 television movie, entitled A Cry for Help: The Tracey Thurman Story, starring Nancy McKeon as Tracey, Dale Midkiff as Buck, Bruce Weitz as Tracey's lawyer Burton Weinstein, and Philip Baker Hall as presiding Judge Blumenfeld.

Plot  France, 1993. The retired Colonel Raoul Duplan is shot in his home. As the police are baffled, young army officer Galois is brought to help the investigation. Shortly thereafter she receives a letter containing some diary pages of a lieutenant Guy Rossi who served in 1955 in the Algerian war under the command of Duplan and disappeared in 1957 under mysterious circumstances. Every day Galois receives a continuation of the diary in which Rossi describes in detail his ambivalent relationship to Duplan and his dirty methods. As she reads the diary the film flashes back to black-and-white scenes of Rossis' experiences. Rossi witness torture and public executions, and finds himself torn between wanting peace and disgust at the brutal methods being employed to secure it. Rossi inadvertently reveals information to a friend sympathetic to the rebels which may have led to the murder of a shopkeeper who was providing information to the French army. Ordered by Duplan to command a firing squad, he resolves to disobey his superior's orders. It is revealed he left the diary with the friend with the intended final recipient being his father because he feared for his life. A recent appearance on TV of Col. Duplan prompted his friend to finally deliver the letter to Rossis' father, who, when confronted by Galois readily reveals he has been the one sending the diary and that he committed the murder because Duplan expressed no remorse for his son's murder, Duplan justifying himself by saying Rossi was a traitor. The film ends somewhat ambiguously as Galois, as an army officer, lacks the authority to arrest the elder Rossi, and while driving back from the interview, seems moved by the experience and decides to get lunch with her commanding officer instead of immediately returning to the office.

He was the brother-in-law of the celebrated Witch of Kilkenny, Alice Kyteler, and is mainly remembered today for his efforts to shield her from prosecution, and subsequently enabling her to escape punishment, during the Kilkenny Witch Trials of 1324.  Biography  He was born in Kilkenny: the Outlawe or Utlagh family were prominent merchants of Kilkenny city (\\"Utlagh\\" or \\"Utluighe\\" was a medieval Irish word for outlaw, though it was apparently not in common use). His brother William was Mayor of Kilkenny around 1301: William is best remembered as the first husband of Alice Kyteler, a connection which caused Roger trouble in later life.O'Flanagan J. Roderick Lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of Ireland 2 Volumes London 1870 Roger joined the Order of the Knights Hospitallers: they were a military order, and Roger served as a military commander with the English army against the Scots, in which capacity he is said to have given good service to the Crown.Ball F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 John Murray London 1926 He became Prior of the Order's house at Kilmainham in 1317 or 1318 : as such he was entitled to sit in Parliament, where he soon acquired a reputation as an able statesman. He was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1321 and served till 1325; between 1320 and his death in 1341 he frequently acted as Justiciar or Deputy Justiciar. At the same time he was fully involved in the affairs of the Priory of Kilmainham and is said to have done much to increase its revenues.O'Flanagan Lives of the Lord Chancellors He died at the Order's house in County Limerick, which gave its name to the present-day town of Hospital. Hospital, County Limerick, where Roger died in 1341  Kilkenny Witch Trials  In 1324, while he was Lord Chancellor, Roger became both personally and politically involved in the Kilkenny Witch Trials. The Bishop of Ossory, Richard de Ledrede, a noted \\"scourge of witches and heretics\\", accused a number of prominent local citizens of witchcraft; the alleged leaders of the coven were Roger's sister-in-law Alice Kyteler and her son William Outlawe junior.Seymour, St. John D. Irish Witchcraft and Demonology 1913 In the circumstances the Bishop's request that the Chancellor should arrest his own family was a strange one. Roger, who was described by O'Flanagan as a man who was \\"not so credulous as others, or [more] willing to befriend his relatives\\" O'Flanagan Lives of the Lord Chancellors advised that forty days must elapse before an arrest could be made. When the Bishop refused to be persuaded to drop the case he was arrested himself, almost certainly with the Chancellor's connivance, and imprisoned for seventeen days. Undeterred by his imprisonment, Ledrede on his release from prison made a second request that Roger arrest the suspects; at the same time he ignored a summons from the Chancellor to appear and justify putting his diocese under an interdict. Despite Roger's efforts to frustrate the proceedings the Bishop persuaded the Justiciar of Ireland, John Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Knayth, to put the alleged witches on trial. Roger is said to have been present at the trials, but any efforts he made to secure the acquittal of the accused were in vain: all of them were found guilty. Alice managed to escape from prison and flee the country, no doubt with her brother-in-law's help, but William was sentenced to do penance and another of the accused, Petronella de Meath, was burnt at the stake. Petronella's daughter Basilia escaped with Alice.Seymour Irish Witchcraft and Demonology Ledrede now decided to attack the Chancellor himself and in 1328 accused him of heresy. This proved to be a serious error of judgment: Roger was a trusted servant of the Crown and generally respected, and no-one except Ledrede believed that he was guilty of anything but a quite understandable desire to help his family. Roger sensibly insisted on a full inquiry: a Commission of Inquiry was appointed, including most of the senior clergy, magnates and gentry of the Pale, which invited witnesses to appear and make any charges they wished. While some witnesses did testify against Roger, the report of the Commission was that he was a zealous and orthodox champion of the faith.

It was introduced in unpublished work of Eliyahu Rips in about 1991. An R-tree is a uniquely arcwise-connected metric space in which every arc is isometric to some real interval. Rips proved the conjecture of that any finitely generated group acting freely on an R-tree is a free product of free abelian and surface groups . Actions of surface groups on R-trees By Bass‚ÄìSerre theory, a group acting freely on a simplicial tree is free. This is no longer true for R-trees, as showed that the fundamental groups of surfaces of Euler characteristic less than ‚àí1 also act freely on a R-trees. They proved that the fundamental group of a connected closed surface S acts freely on an R-tree if and only if S is not one of the 3 nonorientable surfaces of Euler characteristic ‚â•‚àí1. Applications The Rips machine assigns to a stable isometric action of a finitely generated group G a certain \\"normal form\\" approximation of that action by a stable action of G on a simplicial tree and hence a splitting of G in the sense of Bass‚ÄìSerre theory.

It recognizes that economic growth does not inherently contribute to human development and calls for changes in social, political, and environmental values and practices.  History  In 1984, David Korten, a former regional advisor to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), proposed a people-centered development strategy that incorporated the values of justice, sustainability, and inclusiveness. According to Korten, the prevailing growth-focused development strategy is unsustainable and inequitable. He calls for transformations of our institutions, technology, values, and behavior, \\"consistent with our ecological and social realities.\\" Published in 1989, The Manila Declaration on People's Participation and Sustainable Development sets forth principles and guidelines for enacting these transformations. The concept of people-centered development gained recognition at several international development conferences in the 1990s, such as the Earth Summit in 1992, the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in 1994, and the Summit for Social Development of 1995. The concept was first widely promoted in the United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) Human Development Report in 1990, in which countries' level of development was measured by the Human Development Index (HDI). The UNDP's report deems economic growth a necessary means to achieving sustainable development. Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated in its 1996 official development assistance (ODA) report that the objective of people-centered development is, \\"helping humankind lead an affluent and happy life.\\" \\"Shaping the 21st Century,\\" a report published by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1996, made people-centered development a target policy for all member countries. It stressed the importance of local ownership, participation, and capacity building while attaining economic growth.  Central themes  = Sustainability = Sustainability is an inherent component and explicit goal of people-centered development. People- centered development calls for the establishment of self-supporting social and economic systems, key elements of a sustainable society. In addition to its commitment to people-centered development, the DAC High-Level Meeting in May 1996 made sustainability a concrete development goal, requiring the implementation of national sustainability initiatives by 2005 in order to reverse deforestation, water pollution, and other trends of environmental degradation. The Manila Declaration stated that people-centered development is the only way to achieve sustainable communities. Expanding beyond the environmental scope of sustainability, it advocates small-scale community actions in order to enhance economic self-reliance and create reliable sources of income. It also calls for debt reductions and blames excessive long-term foreign debt financing for the cyclical repayment burdens and policy impositions that inhibit sustainable development. David Korten claims that people-centered development is the only way to develop sustainable communities. He criticized the common development practice of increased economic output through natural resource depletion. Korten also advocates sustainability in the financing of development projects and the relationships of external assistance. He calls on external development partners to support objectives chosen by the people, building communities' capacity to manage resources and meet local needs independently. = Participation = In the context of people-centered development, central elements of participation include: *Democratic processes *Government accountability *Access to relevant information *Gender equality The OECD noted that democratic processes are essential to people-centered development because they allow communities to create their own development goals and influence the decisions that determine their quality of life. Community participation and true democratic process demand that people have the means to hold government officials and public institutions accountable. It requires that governments act as enablers for the peoples' agenda, creating policies that enhance citizen action. Communities must have access to relevant, reliable information in order to make the best decisions for themselves and their communities. The Manila Declaration proposed global monitoring systems to increase peoples' access to relevant information in order for communities to make rational decisions and protect their interests. True democratic processes can only be achieved when men and women are represented equally. People-centered development necessitates equality in the roles of men and women, a systemic problem in many developing nations. The OECD noted several reasons why women are essential to sustainable, people-centered development: #the rate of return on female education investment could be higher than that of any other investment, #the problems brought by poverty affect women more than other groups, #as managers of natural resources, women are key contributors to sustainability = Justice = In the context of people-centered development, elements of justice include: *Local ownership *Sovereignty of the people & government enablement *Employment and income generation The OECD's DAC affirms that the role of external development partners is to enhance developing countries' capacity to meet sustainable development requirements. This strategy emphasizes the need for local ownership so that communities have responsibility and control over their resources in order to benefit themselves and also stresses the role of government as an enabler for the peoples' agenda. According to David Korten, individuals have a greater incentive to pursue sustainable environmental practices when resources are locally owned. In addition, he says that people- centered development \\"rejects the right of one person to self-enrichment based on the appropriation of the resources on which another person's survival depends.\\" Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs adopted a strategy of people- centered development in 1996, citing the concept's growing centrality at international development conferences. It recognized a primary concern of people-centered development ‚Äì whether or not the benefits of economic growth (e.g. increased employment and income) are seen in underserved communities. The Manila Declaration proposed reductions in resource exports in order to address this concern. A reduction in exports would allow communities to meet their local needs first. According to Korten, a share of surplus production should then be used to create high value-added products, providing the optimal benefits to developing communities.

Cardiac arrhythmia is any abnormality in the electrical activity of the heart. Arrhythmias range from mild to severe, sometimes causing symptoms like palpitations, dizziness, fainting, and even death. They can manifest as slow (bradycardia) or fast (tachycardia) heart rate, and may have a regular or irregular rhythm.  Molecular causes of cardiac arrhythmias  The causes of cardiac arrhythmias are numerous, from structural changes in the conduction system (the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, or His-Purkinje system) and cardiac muscle, to mutations in genes coding for ion channels of the heart. Movement of ions, particularly Na+, Ca2+ and K+, causes depolarizations of cell membranes in node cells, which are then transmitted to cardiac muscle cells to induce contraction. After depolarization, the ions are moved back to their original locations, leading to repolarization of the membrane and relaxation. Disruptions in ion flow affect the heart's ability to contract by altering the resting membrane potential, affecting the cell's ability to conduct or transmit an action potential (AP), or by affecting the rate or force of contraction. The specific molecular changes involved in arrhythmias depend on the nature of the problem. Ion channel mutations can alter protein conformation, and so change the amount of current flowing through these channels. Due to changes in amino acids and binding domains, mutations may also affect the ability of these channels to respond to physiological changes in cardiac demand. Mutations resulting in loss of function of K+ channels can result in delayed repolarization of the cardiac muscle cells. Similarly, gain of function of Na+ and Ca2+ channels results in delayed repolarization, and Ca2+ overload causing increased Ca2+ binding to cardiac troponin C, more actin-myosin interactions and causing an increased contractility, respectively. Mutations cause many arrhythmic conditions, including atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter (AFl), and ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib). Arrhythmias can also be induced by altered activity of the vagus nerve and activation of Œ≤1 adrenergic receptors.  Mechanism of action  Celivarone is a non-iodinated benzofuran derivative, structurally related to amiodarone, a drug commonly used to treat arrhythmias. Celivarone has potential as an antiarrhythmic agent, attributable to its multifactorial mechanism of action; blocking Na+, L-type Ca2+ and many types of K+ channels (IKr, IKs, IKACh and IKv1.5), as well as inhibiting Œ≤1 receptors, all in dose-dependent manners. The mechanisms by which celivarone modifies ion flow through these channels is unknown, but hearts demonstrate longer PQ intervals and decreased cell shortening, indicative of blocked L-type Ca2+ channels, depressed maximum current with each action potential with no change in the resting membrane potential, caused by blocked Na+ channels, and longer action potential duration due to K+ channel blocks. Celivarone is therefore described as having class I, II, III, and IV antiarrhythmic properties.  Indications for use  Celivarone displays some atrial selectivity, suggesting it may be most effective at targeting atrial arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. These conditions are characterized by rapid atrial rates, 400‚Äì600 bpm for atrial fibrillation and 150‚Äì300 bpm for atrial flutter. Studies have shown celivarone is capable of cardioversion, maintaining normal sinus cardiac rhythms, being effective in hypokalemic, vasotonic, and stretch-induced atrial fibrillation, as well as ischemic and reperfusion ventricular fibrillation. Since it affects multiple ion channels, it also shows promise in treating genetic forms of arrhythmia caused by several ion channel mutations.  Future research  Celivarone may be an effective antihypertensive therapy, as it inhibits both angiotensin II and phenylephrine induced hypertension in dogs, despite having no affinity for these receptors. Atrial fibrillation is especially common in hypertensive adults so a single drug to combat both problems is desirable. The non-iodinated nature of celivarone means that the harmful side-effects on the thyroid commonly seen with amiodarone therapy are eliminated, making the drug an attractive alternative. Higher oral bioavailability, shorter duration of action, and lower accumulation in body tissues are also benefits of celivarone. Presently, two studies are underway to determine if the effects observed in the animal models are reproducible in a human population.

It is named after F. H. Bradley who discussed the problem in his 1893 book Appearance and Reality. It bears a close kinship to the issue of the unity of the proposition.  Description Bradley raises the problem while discussing the bundle theory of objects, according to which an object is merely a \\"bundle\\" of properties. This theory raises the question of how the various properties that together comprise an object are related when they in fact comprise an object. More generally, the question that arises is what has to be the case for any two things to be related. Bradley's Regress appears to show that the notion of two things being related generates an infinite regress. Suppose, for example, that a respects b. This state of affairs seems to involve three things: a, b, and the relation of respecting. For the state of affairs of a respecting b to obtain, it doesn't, however, suffice that these three things (a, b, and the relation of respecting) exist. They must also be related in some way. What is required, we might say, is that a and b \\"stand in\\" the relation of respecting. But now we seem to have another state of affairs: the state of affairs of a and b standing in the relation of respecting. This state of affairs in turn seems to involve four things: a, b, the relation of respecting, and the relation of standing in. Again, however, for it to be the case that a and b stand in the relation of respecting, it doesn't suffice that these four items exist. They must also be related in some way. What is required, we might now say, is that a, b, and the relation of respecting stand in the relation of standing in. And so on, ad infinitum.  Responses  In Appearance and Reality, Bradley seems to conclude that the regress should lead us to abandon the idea that relations are \\"independently real\\". One way to take this suggestion is as recommending that in the case of a respecting b, we are dealing with a state of affairs that has only two constituents: a and b. It does not, in addition, involve a third item, \\"the relation of respecting\\", to which a and b must then bear some further relation (\\"standing in\\"). A different option is to accept that the regress is real, but to deny that it is a vicious regress.

Biography  Marino Tartaglia was born 3 August 1894 in Zagreb. He completed elementary school and the Royal High School in Split. In 1907 he encountered Emanuel Vidoviƒá, and became interested in painting. He studied drawing with Virgil Meneghello Dinƒçiƒá. In He enrolled in the Architectural School ( Graƒëevna struƒçna ≈°kola) in Zagreb (1908‚Äì1912) where among his teachers were well-known painters: Oton Ivekoviƒá, Ivan Ti≈°ov, Robert Frange≈° Mihanoviƒá and Bela ƒåiko≈° Sesija. In the turbulent times before the First World War, fearing political persecution, he left for Italy, first to Florence, then to Rome, where in 1913 he enrolled in the Instituto Superiore di Belle Arti. He spent a brief time as a volunteer on the Salonika front, but quickly returned to Rome where he worked an assistant to Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, then returned to Florence where he got to know the Futurist artists Carlo Carr√†, Giorgio de Chirico and others. Following the war, he spent time in Split (1918‚Äì1921), then travelled to Vienna, Belgrade, and Paris. Returning to Zagreb in 1931, at the request of Vladimir Beciƒá, Tartaglia started work as a trainee teacher at the Academy of Fine Arts, becoming a lecturer in 1940, associate professor in 1944, and full professor in 1947. He trained several generations of Croatian painters. From 1948 he was a full member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

It was a predecessor to the modern-day republic of The Gambia. Gambia was given independence from Britain in 1965 under the Gambia Independence Act 1964, which unified the British Crown Colony and Protectorate of the Gambia into an independent sovereign state. The British monarch, Elizabeth II, remained head of state of the Gambia, which shared its Sovereign with other Commonwealth realms. The Queen's constitutional roles were mostly delegated to the Governor-General of the Gambia. Governors-general who held office in the Gambia were: #John Warburton Paul (18 February 1965 ‚Äì 9 February 1966) #Farimang Mamadi Singateh ( 9 February 1966 ‚Äì 24 April 1970) After two referenda on the issue, the monarchy was abolished on 24 April 1970, when the Gambia became a republic within the Commonwealth. The first referendum in 1965, with 65.85% in favour and 34.15 against, failed to reach the two-thirds majority needed to pass. The second in 1970 with 70.45% percent of the Gambian people voting in favour of a republic and 29.55% against, was successful. The Gambia adopted a new constitution in 1970 which abolished the monarchy. Dawda Jawara, the prime minister (and head of government) from 1965, became the first President of the Gambia. Queen Elizabeth II did not visit the Gambia between 1965 and 1970. She visited in 1961 (3‚Äì5 December).

Raynham station was located in the village of North Raynham where the line crossed Broadway.

Service was gradually rerouted onto the new branch; Raynham ceased to be a junction in 1932 when rails were removed between the station and Dean Street. The New Haven Railroad ended passenger service to Fall River and New Bedford via Raynham in 1958.

He uncharacteristically places a bet on the horse, to pay for an extravagant promise he has made to contribute to a church reparation fund. He subsequently finds himself in the local police cell for administering, or trying to administer, substances to his sister's horse, substances (unknown to him) adulterated with poison by his butler. He is accused by the local police constable of alienating his wife's affections. In the event, as in most good farces, matters are cheerfully resolved.

Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 Due to its low cost and ease of construction, the Cherokee II is one of the most produced home- built gliders. Design and development The Cherokee was designed by Hall to provide homebuilders with an easy-to-construct and inexpensive aircraft that would give performance at least equal to the Schweizer SGS 1-26, which had flown two years earlier. The Cherokee structure is built from wood and covered in doped aircraft fabric covering. The fuselage features truss construction, with longerons and gussets and a fixed monowheel landing gear. The wing has two spars, with geodetic braces handling the torsion loads and is built with a fixed center section and removable outer wing panels. The wings have spoilers on the top surfaces and use a G√∂ 549 airfoil. As with all plans-built aircraft, builders have made modifications to the design. Some examples have been built with leading edges made from aluminium, cardboard, glass reinforced plastic and plywood and with many different styles of canopy.

He emerged as a brigand leader to become a national hero after his five-year struggle against Italian rule in Ethiopia.  Early Life  Belay Zeleke was a hero and patriot leader who distinguished himself during the Italian occupation of Ethiopia in 1936‚Äì1941. He was born in 1912 in Bichen, Gojjam. His father, Ba≈°≈°a Z√§ll√§q√§ Laq√§w, was a native of L√§mc√§n in Goggam and his mother, W√§yz√§ro Taytu As√§ne, was a native of G√©rru Gonta in W√§llo. B√§lay‚Äôs father was a loyal and close servant of L√©g Iyyasu, who bestowed him the title of Basha, and is said to have had a considerable number of troops under his command. After the fall of L√©g Iyyasu, Basha Zeleke first moved to his wife‚Äôs residence, in Caqq√§ta, and later to L√§mc√§n in Gojjam, and there submitted to Ras Hailu T√§kl√§ Haymanot. After a while, Zeleke killed a man and refused to submit peacefully to Fitawrari √âmbi√Ωal√§, the governor of Biƒá√§na. The Fitawrari marched to L√§mc√§n to arrest Zeleke. In the skirmish that followed, Zeleke was killed in Q√§nto Maryam, and at Bokk√§nna his body was hung on a tree for a day in order to intimidate the local people. This event had a huge impact on the young B√§lay and his entire family and relatives. B√§lay with his brother, √âgg√©gu, and his mother left L√§mc√§n for Caqq√§ta. It was there that B√§lay mastered his father‚Äôs rifle and began his career as a ≈°√©fta (‚Äòbandit‚Äô), cherishing the idea of avenging the blood of his father. B√§lay, √âgg√©gu (later known as Abba Q√§sto) and another companion were operating between L√§mc√§n and Caqq√§ta and, in the lowland areas of the gorge of Abbay. B√§lay‚Äôs company was joined not only by his relatives but also by other brigands, criminals and outlaws who sought refuge in the bush. B√§lay‚Äôs popularity grew after he avenged the death of his father some time in the middle of 1927, and later, looted cattle, captured firearms and defeated local officials. B√§lay was noted for his courage and determination; he was elected the leader of the group in April 1935. The invasion of Ethiopia by fascist Italy changed the precarious situation in Gojjam. B√§lay and his followers, who numbered some 50 at that time, got an opportunity to fight for a good cause and legitimize their rebellion. They tried to mobilize and recruit the local people, both peacefully and forcefully. They ambushed the Italians and attacked them in their fortifications, capturing numerous firearms. Italian attempts to subdue B√§lay Z√§ll√§q√§ through persuasion failed. B√§lay soon emerged as a prominent patriot leader; between 1937 and 1939 most of the districts in Eastern Goggam were gradually brought under his control; he was communicating with patriots in other regions, particularly with Ras Ab√§b√§ Ar√§gay in ≈†√§wa. It has been documented that B√§lay and the other patriots fought in over 23 important battles between 1937 and 1941 at various locations including: Ab√§ra, B√§r√§nta, Biƒá√§na, Caqq√§ta, D√§br√§ W√§rq, D√§g√§n, Dances, Dibisa, Dima, D√©lanta, Gonga, Gubaya, Garso, √ânn√§bse, L√§mc√§n, M√§kan√§ S√§lam, Malka, Somma, Tiq, Waseda, Wa≈°≈°age and Yage. B√§lay bestowed traditional titles and military ranks to the patriots and established his own administration. As Italy was defeated and Hayl√§ S√©llase I returned from his exile through D√§br√§ Marqos on 6 April 1941, B√§lay reportedly had 40,000‚Äì45,000 combatants, who presented themselves in a military parade in front of the emperor, singing war songs and heroic recitals. Hayl√§ S√©llase was impressed and rewarded B√§lay with 12,000 Thalers, and then invited him for a private talk. After the liberation, the history of B√§lay Z√§ll√§q√§ was dramatic. He was appointed the governor of Biƒá√§na, his home province, with the title of D√§ggazmaƒá; he was supposed to keep Gojjam‚Äôs nobility in check. However, B√§lay was disappointed: several districts that were previously under B√§lay‚Äôs control were given to other noblemen. B√§lay‚Äôs adversaries began to disseminate rumours and send reports to Addis Ababa telling that B√§lay refused to accept government orders and revolted against the imperial administration. Troops from Goggam, W√§llo and ≈†√§wa were sent to Biƒá√§na to arrest him. B√§lay decided to resist, and, together with his followers, he fortified himself in Somma. After three weeks of heavy fighting, some of his combatants were killed, some wounded, others weakened, and some defected; finally, B√§lay was arrested, taken to Addis Ab√§ba and sentenced to life imprisonment. Later it was reported that on the way to Goggam after he attempted to escape from custody with other prisoners, he was brought to court again and was sentenced to death. The emperor confirmed the death penalty, and B√§lay was publicly hanged, together with two of his brothers, on 13 January 1945 in Addis Ab√§ba. He was 35 when he died; by four wives, he had three daughters (Y√§rome, Y√§≈°a≈°w√§rq and Y√§≈°imm√§bet) and four sons (Admasu, Go≈°≈°u, Bahru and M√§laku). Second Italo-Ethiopian War When Belay learned that Italians had invaded Ethiopia he decided to fight. Within a few days he found a convoy of the Italian army proceeding from Debre Marqos to Bicheno, where he ambushed and killed most of them and took their weapons. He was successful in most of his further fighting with the Italians in Gojjam, Wollo and Shewa. As his war activities intensified and his followers increased, many began to address him as leul Belay (\\"His Highness Belay\\") and atse begulbetu (\\"King by his own might\\"). Belay bestowed upon his followers the traditional titles, such as qenyazmach, dejazmach, Fit'awrari, and ras. When his brother, dejazmach Ejigu, asked him \\"what title is left for you, as you have given all to your followers?\\", he replied: \\"I need no title as my mother had already called me Belay\\" (in Amharic Belay means \\"one who is superior to others\\"). In April 1941, the British forces led by General Wingate liberated Debre Marqos from Italian occupation led by Italian Commander Maraventano. By April 5, the Italians fled to Shoa, the Debre Marqos fell under the control of ras Hailu Tekle Haymanot who then requested Belay to come to Debra Marqos by offering him his daughter for marriage. Ras Hailu then insisted on meeting Haile Selassie and had a confrontation with the British forces. When Belay arrived in Debre Marqos, General Wingate ordered that he remain outside of the city at gunpoint and Haile Selassie eventually met him. Rebellion After the restoration of independence in 1941, atse Haile Selassie I gave Belay the title of dejazmach and appointed him the governor of Bicheno. He tried to fill the subordinate position with his past comrades-in-arms, but his superiors wanted to appoint judges and other functionaries themselves. When Belay refused to appoint those proteges, the superior Gojjam officials reported this to the Emperor, alleging that Belay was revolting against the Emperor's government. He did not carry out the order even when Haile Selassie summoned the quarrelling parties to Addis Ababa. The Emperor sent an army to arrest him, but Belay resisted by holding out in a fortress on Somma mountain. After losing many men, the Emperor dispatched a delegation to him with a promise that he would pardon him, but after Belay surrendered, he was tried by a special commission and sentenced to death. = Death = Belay's death penalty was confirmed by the Emperor, but changed later to life imprisonment. After a few years in prison he made an escape attempt under pressure from lij Mammo Haile Mikael, an Itallian collaborator who was imprisoned in the compound of the Grand Palace with him. They were re-arrested and brought to justice. Belay was arrested and executed by hanging in Teklehaimanot Square in Addis Ababa along with his brother Ejigu and other rebels on 12 January 1945.  Legacy  Dejazmach Belay Zeleke is remembered as a hero in Gojjam. In order to acquiesce the province, after Belay's hanging, the imperial government changed the taxation policy in Gojjam to the pre-war system. The major road and school in Addis Ababa are named after him: dejazmach Belay Zeleke Street and dejazmach Belay Zeleke Secondary School. There is also a Belay Zeleke road in Bahir Dar.

It is planned to open in late 2023 as part of the first phase of the South Coast Rail project. Middleborough Junction and East Taunton stations were served by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and several predecessors until 1927. In 2009, South Coast Rail planning identified Taunton Depot, just north of Middleborough Junction (Cotley Junction), as a preferred station site. A 2017 re-evaluation of the project recommended an interim route through Middleborough, with East Taunton station located just south of the junction. A construction contract was issued in 2020. Station design The station will be located in the southeast portion of Taunton along the New Bedford Secondary, slightly northwest of the Route 24 expressway. The station driveway (an extension of the existing Industrial Drive) will be reached from Country Drive (Route 140) just north of the Route 24/Route 140 interchange. East Taunton will have a single full- length high-level island platform, long and wide. It will serve the two passenger tracks, with a freight bypass track to the west. Two footbridges ‚Äì one with stairs, the other with ramps ‚Äì will connect the platform to the 363-space parking lot, which includes a turnout for Greater Attleboro Taunton Regional Transit Authority (GATRA) buses. History =Former service= alt=A postcard of a small station at a railroad junction The Taunton Branch Railroad was extended to as the New Bedford and Taunton Railroad in 1840. The Middleborough and Taunton Railroad opened from Middleborough to Cotley Junction (Middleborough Junction) ‚Äì south of Taunton on the New Bedford and Taunton Railroad ‚Äì in 1856. No station was located at the junction, which was in a relatively unpopulated area. East Taunton station on the Middleborough and Taunton was located east at Old Colony Avenue in East Taunton village. The Middleborough and Taunton was acquired by the Old Colony Railroad in 1874, followed by the former New Bedford and Taunton (after several ownership and name changes) in 1879. The Old Colony was in turn acquired by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1893. Local passenger service between Middleborough and Taunton was operated as ‚ÄìPlymouth or ‚ÄìPlymouth trains; it was discontinued in 1927 when service on the Darby Branch ended. East Taunton station was closed; the line was used by New York‚ÄìCape Cod trains until 1964, and commuter rail service to New Bedford via Taunton lasted until 1958. Freight service continued on the Middleboro Secondary and New Bedford Subdivision; the state purchased the former line from Conrail in December 1982. =South Coast Rail= In September 2008, MassDOT released 18 potential station sites for the South Coast Rail project, including two potential East Taunton sites: one just west of Route 24 if trains were routed through Middleborough, and one to the north off Route 140 if trains were routed through Stoughton or Attleboro. The 2009 selection of the Stoughton route included Taunton Depot at the northern site. It was to have an island platform flanked by two passenger tracks, with a freight passing track on the western side. Plans released as part of the Final Environmental Impact Report in 2013 were nearly identical. On June 11, 2010, the state took ownership of the New Bedford Subdivision and several other CSX lines as part of a sale agreement. In 2017, the project was re-evaluated due to cost issues. The new proposal called for early service via Middleborough by 2022, followed by full service via Stoughton by 2030. The 2017 proposal attracted criticism from local officials across the route, including Taunton officials unhappy that the downtown Taunton station would be delayed until 2030. The January 2018 Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report considered several service patterns: serving Taunton Depot and/or Taunton stations with a reverse move on some or all trains, or a new East Taunton station near the previously proposed southern site. The latter option was chosen for lower costs and shorter travel times. Two sites just south of Cotley Junction, and one site at Old Colony Avenue (the former East Taunton station location) were considered. The previously-considered southern site (a former sports complex on Industrial Drive at 1141 County Street) was chosen. The site is adjacent to the interchange between the Route 24 expressway and Country Drive (Route 140). As with the former Taunton Depot plans, the station will have a single island platform with two passenger tracks and a freight passing track. The sports complex was demolished in 2020 to make room for the station and its parking lot. The MBTA awarded a $403.5 million contract for the Middleborough Secondary and New Bedford Secondary portions of the project, including East Taunton station, on August 24, 2020. Construction was expected to begin later in 2020 and take 37 months, with a late 2023 opening.

Early life Charles Victor Jaclard came from a humble working-class family, but, as a precocious student, he was given a good education, obtaining degrees in mathematics as well as medicine. However, during his studies, he became involved in the radical republican opposition to Napol√©on III. After working as a mathematics teacher, he moved to Paris in 1864 to pursue further studies in pharmacology. He soon fell in with the followers of the veteran revolutionary Louis Auguste Blanqui and joined the Blanquists' secret society. In 1865 he helped organise Blanqui's escape from prison to Belgium. That year, Jaclard attended the International Student Congress in Li√®ge, where he gave a speech expounding atheism, materialism and socialism. The speech led the French Council of Universities to ban him from all French universities. First International and exile Jaclard was one of the earliest French Blanquists to join the First International, which had been founded in 1864. Other Blanquists initially remained aloof from the organisation because its French section was dominated by followers of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, whom they considered insufficiently revolutionary. Jaclard, however, seems to have moved easily among the factions of contemporary revolutionary socialism. While he remained involved in the Blanquist organisation, he was on friendly terms with Proudhonist Internationalists like Beno√Æt Malon. In 1866, Jaclard was imprisoned for six months for participating in a demonstration. After his release, he was one of Six Blanquists from Paris who appeared at the 1st General Congress of the International Workingmen's Association held in Geneva, Switzerland from September 3 to 8, 1866. They tried to denounce the French representatives as emissaries of Napoleon III, but were thrown out as unaccredited. In 1868, Jaclard was one of the founding members of the International Alliance of Socialist Democracy in Geneva, an organisation created by the Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. It was affiliated with the International Workingmen's Association (the First International), but Bakunin's International Alliance soon came into conflict with the London leadership of the International Association, dominated by Karl Marx. Jaclard's involvement with the Bakuninist Alliance once again demonstrated his ability to transcend factional disputes; in general, the Blanquists were wary of anarchism. The Paris Commune Jaclard remained in exile in Geneva until the fall of Napol√©on III in 1870. He returned to France to take part in the revolution and in the defence of France against the Germans, who were winning the Franco-Prussian War. In early September 1870, Victor Jaclard seems to have been involved in the uprising of the Lyons Commune, which proclaimed the Republic even before Paris did. Bakunin arrived in Lyons on September 16. Jaclard went on to Paris, charged with establishing a liaison between the Commune of Lyons and the Paris Commune. Sometime earlier, he had met the Russian feminist and revolutionary socialist Anna Vasilevna Korvin-Kurkovskaya (1843‚Äì1887) who, after leaving Russia in 1869 \\"chaperoned\\" by her newly married sister Sofia Kovalevskaya and her husband Vladimir Kovalevsky had clandestinely gone to Paris. Victor and Anna remained in Paris for the duration of the Franco-Prussian war, and played an active part in the Commune. They contributed to several revolutionary journals and acted as representatives of the First International (Victor was among the representatives of the French section, Anna represented the Russian section). Victor Jaclard was elected commander of the 158th battalion of the National Guard and took part in the insurrection of October 31. In November he became deputy mayor of the 18th district (arrondissement); the mayor was the republican Georges Clemenceau. In February 1871, Jaclard ran unsuccessfully as a Socialist-Revolutionary candidate in the elections to the National Assembly. During the 'Bloody Week' Jaclard fought on the barricades at Batignolles and Ch√¢teau d'eau. With the fall of the Paris Commune, Jaclard was captured and imprisoned by Thiers' forces, and condemned to death. Anna managed however to escape the country, to London, where she stayed for a time at the home of Karl Marx. Anna's parents were alerted to the crisis, probably by her sister Sofia and her husband Vladimir Kovalevsky. The father of Anna and Sofia, retired artillery General Vasily Vasilievich Korvin-Krukovsky, came to Paris from Switzerland, and sent a plea for clemency to Thiers though a mutual acquaintance. Thiers replied that he could not liberate the condemned prisoner, but gave some information as to the subsequent whereabouts of the prisoners, who were to be moved through the streets of Paris at a specific time. With this knowledge, on October 1, someone (possibly Vladimir Kovalevsky) rescued him from the armed guard and helped spirit him out of the country, to Switzerland, where he was joined by Anna and her parents, and where, they finally officially married. Second exile Jaclard's recent entanglements with Bakunin apparently did not stand in the way of friendly relations with Marx. In 1874, the Jaclards moved back to Anna's native Russia, where Victor became a teacher of French at a gymnasium for young women. Through Anna he was introduced to Russian Narodnik circles. He contributed to the Russian oppositional journals Slovo and Delo. The couple also maintained friendly relations with Anna's former suitor, Dostoevsky. This demonstrated broad-mindedness on both sides; not only could Anna's past relationship with Dostoevsky have made things awkward, but Dostoevsky was also, by this time, deeply religious and politically conservative. The Jaclards meanwhile were professed atheists, materialists and communists, or, in the Russian terminology of the time, 'nihilists'. Return to France In 1880, a general amnesty of Communards enabled the Jaclards returned to France. Jaclard resumed his association with the Blanquists but, characteristically, also remained on good terms with several other political factions. He seems to have been involved in founding the Marxist French Workers' Party of Jules Guesde and Paul Lafargue while simultaneously maintaining good relations with Clemenceau. While republicans like Clemenceau were shedding whatever socialist sympathies they may once have had and moving into positions of power in the Third Republic, the French Blanquists and Marxists firmly opposed socialist participation in 'bourgeois' republican governments and furiously denounced reformist socialists like Alexandre Millerand who sought power. Jaclard was once again able to straddle that divide. In the 1880s, Jaclard edited the journal La Justice. This was Clemenceau's paper. In 1889 he was elected to the city council of Alfortville, where he had settled after Anna's death in 1887. Apparently, Jaclard's capacity for broad sympathy with all sorts of radical causes led him to sympathize with General Georges Boulanger's campaign for a revision of the constitution in the late 1880s. Many French socialists and republicans suspected Boulanger of monarchist designs, but the General professed himself a sincere republican and social reformer. Jaclard was not the only veteran Blanquist to sympathize with Boulangism; in fact the Blanquist Central Revolutionary Committee had split over it, with Ernest Granger leading the Boulangist minority on a long march to the far right, while √âdouard Vaillant led the anti-Boulangists into an alliance with Marxism. Jaclard, meanwhile, apparently remained on good terms with all concerned. The Second International The First International had expired in the 1870s, due to the factional conflict between Marxists and Bakuninists. The anarchists had kept their own International going for some time, but the socialist International was practically defunct. In the late 1880s, efforts were made to revive it, which led eventually to the creation of the Second International in 1889. Jaclard was actively involved in these endeavours. He was a French delegate to the International congresses of 1889, 1891 and 1893, held in Paris, Brussels and Zurich, respectively. Jaclard was also a member of the Union of Socialist Journalists, serving as its (1843- general secretary. He was also the author of the pamphlet Tactiques Socialistes (1893). Although Jaclard had not spent much of his time practising medicine, he seems to have remained a doctor in good standing in the eyes of his profession. At any rate, the British Medical Journal of May 2, 1903, noted his recent death.\\"Dr. Victor Jaclard, of Paris, who had a stormy career as a politician, and was for a long time associated with M. Clemenceau (himself a member of the medical profession)...\\" British Medical Journal, 1903 Vol. 1 (May 2, 1903), p. 1062. What is striking about Jaclard is his political adaptability and the ease with which he maintained good personal as well as political relations with representatives of very different, and in some cases mutually hostile, ideological tendencies: Blanquism, Proudhonism, Bakuninism, Marxism, Clemenceauvian Radicalism and Boulangism.

Under current plans, the station would open for MBTA Commuter Rail service in 2023 as part of the first phase of the South Coast Rail project. History =Previous stations= A postcard of Assonet station The Fall River Railroad opened from Myricks to Fall River in June 1845, and to South Braintree in December 1846. Two stations were located on the line in Freetown: Assonet at Elm Street, and Crystal Spring (Thwaites) at Copicut Road. Somerset Junction (Millers) - the junction with the Dighton and Somerset Railroad - was located further to the south in Fall River. Service was later consolidated under the Old Colony Railroad and then the New Haven Railroad. Passenger service on the line continued (except for 1949-1952) until September 5, 1958. However, local stops including the two Freetown stops were discontinued well before then, and trains ran nonstop from Fall River to Taunton. The line continued to be used for freight service by the New Haven and its successors Penn Central and Conrail, then finally as the CSX Fall River Subdivision. =South Coast Rail= In September 2008, MassDOT released 18 potential station sites for the South Coast Rail project, including a Freetown station off South Main Street near the Route 24/79 expressway. A 2009 conceptual design called for a single side platform serving one track, with a second track allowing freight trains to pass the high-level platform. Plans released as part of the Final Environmental Impact Report in 2013 were nearly identical. On June 11, 2010, the state took ownership of the Fall River Subdivision and several other CSX lines as part of a sale agreement. In 2017, the project was re-evaluated due to cost issues. A new proposal released in March 2017 called for early service via Middleborough by 2024, followed by full service via Stoughton by 2029. Freetown would have only been built as an infill station during the second phase. By mid-2017, plans called for the first phase to be completed in 2022, and to include stations at Freetown and Battleship Cove in Phase 1 rather than Phase 2. The January 2018 Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report moved the planned station about north, as the previously planned site had been developed for use by a business. The MBTA awarded a $159 million contract for construction of the Fall River Secondary portion of the project, including Freetown station, in May 2020. Service was then planned to begin in November 2023.

She is the author of the famous vals criollo (Creole Waltz) \\"Desde el alma\\" for which she is known as the first widely recognized female Rioplatense Hispanic composer in the world. Family Life Rosita was born in Montevideo on July 9, 1897, as the youngest child of Italian immigrants Michele Mela and Rosa Luciano de Mela, from Rionero in Vulture, Basilicata. She was baptized at the cathedral of Montevideo. Shortly after, the family migrated to Argentina in 1900. They settled in Buenos Aires when Rosita was three years old. On February 23, 1922, she married the young poet and writer Victor Piuma V√©lez who would write the lyrics for all her compositions. Musical influence Rosita showed a great talent for music. At the age of four she could already play the piano by ear. Once in primary school, she never gave up her music studies. She later studied piano in Buenos Aires and ultimately became a professor of piano and concert at the prestigious Thibaud-Piazzini conservatory. Works Throughout her life, she created a body of work that includes tango, waltz, classical and Creole (vals criollo) waltzes, pasodobles, polkas and marches. Among them: \\"Oraci√≥n\\", \\"Tatita\\" and \\"Aquel entonces\\" as well as the waltzes \\"Yo te adoro\\", \\"Por el camino\\", \\"Una l√°grima para pap√°\\", \\"Cuando de ti ya lejos\\" and \\"Aquellos catorce a√±os\\".http://danzadetango.com/articulos-03.html The poems of Rosita were published in newspapers and cultural magazines of her time. Her poems were published in the book \\"Antolog√≠a de poetas j√≥venes\\" (\\"Anthology of Young Poets\\") alongside those of Alfonsina Storni and other famous contemporary poets. She gave many concerts of both classical and popular music in different cultural centers in Buenos Aires, earning medals and awards. She was appointed as a representative of music in a ceremony held at the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. = Desde el Alma = In 1911, at the age of 14, Rosita Melo composed her first and now world-famous Boston-style vals criollo \\"Desde el Alma\\" (\\"From the Soul\\"). Other sources date the composition between 1911 and 1917. Rosita is quoted saying it was the work of an adolescent. The waltz's theme is dedicated to the love of a mother. Her husband, Victor Piuma V√©lez, would write the first set of lyrics for it, years later. By 1921, Roberto Firpo had recorded four instrumental waltzes of Rosita. In 1948, Homero Manzi wanted to include the waltz in the movie \\"Pobre mi madre querida\\", but with different lyrics rewritten by himself which would be sung by Hugo del Carril. V√©lez and Melo initially opposed the idea, and requested that if Manzi wrote new lyrics, V√©lez's name should be included as co-author. Manzi ultimately agreed, the lyrics became famous and the waltz, already a classic by the time, became universally famous. Manzi's lyrics remain the most famous ones and are often reinterpreted in different versions of the song when performed by other musicians: Death After her husband passed away in 1976, Rosita Melo died in Buenos Aires on August 12, 1981 and was buried at the \\"Rinc√≥n de las Personalidades\\" (\\"Corner of Personalities\\") in the Chacarita Cemetery there.

Col. Iceal Hambleton, whose call sign was Bat 21 Bravo, c. 1973 The rescue of Bat 21 Bravo, the call sign for Iceal \\"Gene\\" Hambleton, a navigator aboard an EB-66 aircraft shot down behind North Vietnamese lines, was the \\"largest, longest, and most complex search-and-rescue\\" operation during the Vietnam War. Five additional aircraft were shot down during rescue attempts, directly resulting in the deaths of 11 airmen, the capture of two others, and another airman trying to evade capture. On 2 April 1972, the Easter Offensive, the largest combined arms operation of the entire Vietnam War, was in its third day. An early morning flight of two United States Air Force EB-66 aircraft was led by Bat 20, piloted by Lt. Col. Robert Singletary. Hambleton was a navigator aboard Bat 21. The two aircraft were escorting a cell of three B-52s. Bat 21 was configured to gather signals intelligence, including identifying North Vietnamese anti-aircraft radar installations to enable jamming. Bat 21 was destroyed by an SA-2 surface-to-air missile and Hambleton was the only survivor, parachuting behind the front lines into a battlefield filled with thousands of North Vietnamese Army soldiers. Takhli, Thailand. Hambleton had Top Secret access to Strategic Air Command operations and was an expert in surface-to-air missile countermeasures. The North Vietnamese Army may have possessed information about his presence in Vietnam and his capture would have meant a huge intelligence bonanza for the Soviet Union. Hambleton and 1st Lt. Mark Clark, who was shot down during rescue operations, were finally recovered from behind the front lines on two different nights in covert, night-time rescues carried out by U.S. Navy SEAL Thomas R. Norris and VNN commandos. For their actions in rescuing the two men, Norris was awarded the Medal of Honor and VNN Petty Officer Nguyen Van Kiet was recognized with the Navy Cross. Nguyen was the only South Vietnamese sailor given that award during the war. The Air Force did not put limits on what it took to rescue a downed airman. The direct and indirect cost of rescuing Hambleton was enormous and became a watershed event in Air Force search and rescue. To prevent friendly fire incidents, the Americans imposed a standard no-fire zone within a radius of Hambleton and diverted aircraft to aid in his rescue. It is likely that South Vietnamese soldiers indirectly died as a result of their inability to obtain fire support. The added deaths, loss of aircraft, and length of the rescue operation led the USAF to change the way they planned and conducted search and rescue missions. As a result, they developed new techniques and equipment to improve their ability to rescue downed airmen.  Operational background  Easter or Nguyen Hue Offensive of 1972 At the time of Bat 21's mission, American combat forces had been vastly reduced in South Vietnam under President Richard Nixon's Vietnamization policy. The North Vietnamese Army (NVA) launched the Nguyen Hue Offensive against the South Vietnamese Army and U.S. military on Friday, March 30, 1972. It was their largest attack of the war and was timed to take full advantage of the bad weather typical during monsoon season, offering low clouds and poor visibility. About 30,000 heavily equipped NVA troops from the 304th and 308th Divisions and three separate infantry regiments of the B5 Front crossed the DMZ into I Corps zone across the five northernmost provinces of South Vietnam. In the area between the Cam Lo Bridge and Dong Ha Bridge, the NVA were supported by two tank regiments of 150 Soviet T-54 and PT-76 tanks, 75 tracked anti-aircraft vehicles, an artillery regiment of 47 towed 130mm guns, and the largest concentration of anti-aircraft weaponry of the entire war, including the advanced SA-2 surface- to-air missile (SAM). Their main line of advance was along the axis of the north-south national highway QL-1. When General Creighton Abrams' headquarters in Saigon learned of large NVA movement south of the DMZ, a number of B-52s had been sent on \\"Arc Light\\" missions without escort, but were experiencing significantly increased SAM activity. The 42nd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (42 TEWS) was tapped for assistance. The draw down of troops had left the unit shorthanded and Hambleton was the senior officer among a group of senior navigators. Hambleton assigned himself as navigator on the older EB-66C, which was configured to gather signals intelligence. The newer EB-66E was tasked with jamming SAM radar guidance systems so their missiles could not accurately target the aircraft. The EB-66's mission was to troll for missiles, let them lock on to their aircraft, and then execute a SAM break, a violent turn and dive designed to throw off the pursuing missile. The SA-2 was the size of a telephone pole and carried a proximity fused warhead that was lethal within about , but their guidance systems failed at about 2 Gs, while the EB-66 could achieve 5 Gs in its avoidance maneuver. The crew had successfully pulled a SAM break more than 100 times. The presence of North Vietnamese surface-to-air missiles south of the DMZ had been tracked by Hambleton, but not everyone agreed they were present that far south.  Aircraft shot down  North Vietnamese personnel scramble to ready an SA-2 missile to engage American aircraft.On Easter Sunday, 2 April 1972, two EB-66s (call signs Bat 21 and Bat 22) were flying pathfinder escort for a cell of three B-52, which were given assignments to bomb Mu Gia or the Ban Karai Pass, the two primary access routes to the Ho Chi Minh Trail through Laos. Hambleton was aboard Bat 21, EB-66C serial number 54-0466, over Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province, Vietnam, just south of the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Vietnam. The airmen were surprised by the intensity of the anti-aircraft fire and SAM activity. The NVA 365th Air Defense Division fired two volleys of SA-2 surface-to-air missile at the U.S. planes, but the EB-66s successfully thwarted the first volley. The NVA pointed their Fan Song radar at the B-52s, targeting them unsuccessfully with radar guided anti-aircraft fire. When those missed, the NVA fired two more SAMs optically at Bat 21, only turning on the guidance and radar system after the missiles were launched, which delayed the targeted aircraft's ability to detect and avoid them. When the aircraft crew spotted the missiles, the pilot assumed they had as usual been fired from north of the DMZ. He began a SAM break to the south, away from the direction he assumed the missiles had been fired. One of the EWOs called \\"Negative! Negative!\\", and the pilot flipped the plane over on its other wing. This time the pilot was unable to evade the missiles. The first missile exploded immediately beneath the aircraft striking it at . Hambleton, whose call sign was Bat 21 Bravo, was positioned immediately behind the pilot, who gave the signal for everyone to eject. Hambleton pulled the ejection seat handles and had a moment to make eye contact with the pilot as his seat rocketed out of the dying plane. A moment later, the aircraft was struck by a second SA-2 and exploded. The remainder of the aircraft's six-man crew‚ÄîMaj. Wayne L. Bolte, pilot; 1st Lt.. Robin F. Gatwood, co-pilot; and EWOs Lt. Col. Anthony R. Giannangeli, Lt. Col. Charles A. Levis, and Maj. Henry M. Serex‚Äîwere unable to eject and were listed as missing in action. Their remains were never found. Hambleton was due for some R&R;, and his wife Gwen was planning to meet him in Thailand the next week. She received airplane tickets for her trip on the same day that her husband was shot down. Instead of going to the airport, she collapsed after seeing an Air Force officer and a chaplain walk up her sidewalk. = Surrounded by North Vietnamese = An O-2A Skymaster over Laos, 1970. 602nd Special Operations Squadron. Maj. Jimmy D. Kempton from the 390th Tactical Fighter Squadron was leading a flight of four F-4 Phantoms on a bombing mission when he got SAM warnings. He saw four SA-2 missiles emerge from the clouds about ahead of him and saw one strike Bat 21. At a lower altitude, 1st Lt. Bill Jankowski and Capt. Lyle Wilson in an O-2 (Bilk 34) forward air controller (FAC) aircraft saw Bat 21 explode. Hambleton parachuted into the middle of more than 30,000 troops pouring across the border into South Vietnam. When Hambleton's URC-64 rescue radio beeped, Jankowski responded, and was surprised to learn that Hambleton was above him descending in his parachute. Jankowski followed Hambleton down. Hambleton was concealed by a low fog bank as he landed in a dry rice paddy, unseen by the NVA troops. As Jankowski observed Hambleton land, his aircraft came under heavy antiaircraft fire. He was astonished at the huge number of NVA troops, equipment, and heavy weapons in the area. Hambleton found refuge in a group of bushes in the middle of the rice paddy. NVA troops were less than away. Jankowski fixed Hambleton's location north of the Cam Lo Bridge and just north of TL-88, a major east-west secondary road. Kempton and Jankowski relayed Hambleton's coordinates to King 22, a HC-130 search and rescue (SAR) aircraft operating just south of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã. Recovering Hambleton quickly was essential, as the odds of recovering downed airmen dropped below twenty percent if the aircrew member was on the ground after four hours. But their efforts would be severely hampered by the huge number of troops and large quantity of anti-aircraft fire in the area, some of it supporting the NVA's efforts to capture and protect the Cam Lo Bridge near Hambleton's position. At about the same time that Hambleton was shot down, Capt. John Ripley, adviser to the 3rd Vietnamese Marine Battalion, blew up the key Highway QL-1 bridge over the Cue Viet River, east of Hambleton's position, at ƒê√¥ng H√†. The NVA re-routed thousands of troops, dozens of tanks and other equipment west along TL-88, immediately in front of Hambleton's position, to the Cam Lo River bridge to the west. = Intelligence value = Lt. Col. Iceal Hambleton had more than 20 years of military service. He had served in the Army Air Force as a radio operator during World War II, though not in combat. After World War II, he was recalled to active service by the USAF in the early 1950s. During the Korean War he flew 43 combat missions as a navigator in a B-29 bomber. He then worked during the 1960s on various USAF ballistic missile projects including the PGM-19 Jupiter, Titan I ICBM and Titan II ICBM. He had been the deputy chief of operations for the USAF Strategic Air Command 390th Strategic Missile Wing before the Vietnam War. In April, 1972 he was reassigned from the SAC to TAC and to the 42nd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (42 TEWS), 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, at Korat, Thailand. He was familiar with targeting both SAC missiles and SAC airplanes, was one of the most knowledgeable missile and electronic counter-measures experts in Vietnam, and it is likely that his situation was quickly reported to U.S. intelligence services. Very few Americans remained on the ground in Vietnam, and the NVA made it a point to track particularly valuable personnel, even in Thailand. The North Vietnamese were probably supported by the Russians with decrypting American message traffic and they likely knew exactly who had parachuted into their midst. This ability was likely enabled by the then unknown American spy CWO John Anthony Walker, who had given the Soviets a radio cipher card and other high-value intelligence. Hambleton's capture would be a terrific blow to American airpower around the world and a huge prize for the North Vietnamese and indirectly, the Soviets. Hambleton said after the war that he felt sure if he were captured that he would never have been taken to Hanoi.  Air rescue attempts  A-1H from the 602nd SOS, 1970. Hambleton had received water survival training at Turkey Run, Florida, and escape and evasion training and survival basics at the Pacific Air Command Jungle Survival School in the Philippines. He had shrapnel wounds from his aircraft exploding, a ripped finger, and four compressed vertebra from the force of the ejection. Hidden in a clump of trees in his hole, surrounded by North Vietnamese less than away, Hambleton decided that with only nine months to go until his retirement, he was going to survive and return home. 1st Lt. Richard Abbot flying a FAC O-2 had been shot down offshore shortly before Hambleton, and when Abbot was picked up by the USS Hamner, two Air Force search and rescue Douglas A-1 Skyraiders (Capt. Don Morse in Sandy 07 and his wingman in Sandy 08) from the 1st Special Operations Squadron remained in Hambleton's vicinity. The Sandys immediately scrambled to cover Hambleton's position. When Morse in Sandy 07 first got the call, he thought that, because the aircraft had gone down in South Vietnam, the SAR effort could be accomplished fairly quickly. When he got over Hambelton's position, he was shocked at the amount of ground fire he received. It was more intense than anything he had seen in the war. Some pilots reported that the intensity of the antiaircraft fire was equal to that around Hanoi. Although the U.S. and ARVN forces did not know it yet, the offensive was the largest combined arms attack conducted by the North Vietnamese during the war. Hambleton coolly called in the coordinates of the North Vietnamese around him, watched the ordnance explode, and called in corrections to the FAC above, who relayed the information to the A-1s and the \\"fast movers\\", F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers. FAC pilots after the event were universally amazed at Hambleton's ability to remain calm and call in accurate fire around his position. VNAF UH-1H during a combat mission in Southeast Asia, 1971. Morse called for emergency support, which was picked up by a UH-1H slick (Blue Ghost 39) near Hue, piloted by 1st Lt. Byron Kulland from F Troop, 8th Cavalry, 196th Brigade. Normally based at Marble Mountain Air Facility near Da Nang, Kulland was in the area showing a photographer the developing battle. He had on board with him Capt. Thomas White, the Troop operations officer. After depositing the photographer and White at Phu Bai airfield near Hu·∫ø, White directed Kulland to proceed north and contact the FAC (Jankowski) for information on arrival. White also sent two Cobra gunships, Blue Ghost 28 and 24, and then added Blue Ghost 30, a second Huey. Blue Ghost 39 proceeded across the Song Meiu Giang above the ground towards Hambleton's position with the well-armed Blue Ghost 28 Cobra gunship following about behind and above. Blue Ghost 24 waited at the south side of the Song Meiu Giang for Blue Ghost 30 to catch up. As soon as Blue Ghost 39 and 28 crossed the Song Meiu Giang, Kulland and Rosebeary's aircraft were met by an immediate curtain of North Vietnamese fire from every direction, hurled against them with a strong intensity. Rosebeary in his Cobra Blue Ghost 28 responded with rockets and 40mm fire but both helicopters were struck multiple times. Sikorsky HH-53C during a rescue mission over Southeast Asia Kulland flying Blue Ghost 39 tried to turn back south but only managed to crash-land his stricken aircraft, about east of Hambleton and north of the river in an area full of NVA. When the helicopter smashed into the ground, the only mobile crew member was SP5 Jose Astorga, the door gunner, who had been wounded. He tried but was unable to extract other hurt crew members. Paschall was pinned in the wreckage. Frink, who was seriously wounded, urged Astorga to get out and away from the aircraft. A few moments later advancing North Vietnamese soldiers fired on the wreckage with automatic weapons and the aircraft's fuel tank exploded with the remainder of the crew inside. Astorga was captured but pilots 1st Lt. Byron Kulland and WO John Frink along with SP5 Ronald Paschall were killed. Rosebeary, flying Cobra Blue Ghost 28, called a Mayday but was able to safely exit the area and landed his severely damaged helicopter. His aircraft was totaled. He and Gunner Warrant Officer Charles Gorski were picked up by a HH-53C helicopter (Jolly Green 67), without incident. Rosebeary warned other aircraft against crossing the river. When Morse in Sandy 07 learned that the quick-snatch had failed, he and his wingman Sandy 08 broke off engaging the North Vietnamese and returned to Da Nang. Both Sandys were found to be so damaged they would take several days to repair. At 21:00, Nail 59, a new version of the OV-10A Bronco aircraft equipped with the Pave Nail LORAN radar piloted by Gary Ferentchak, took over FAC duties. The SAR efforts were suspended for the night and the U.S. and ARVN forces remained unaware of the true strength of the NVA offensive. Advised by the FAC to remain in place, Hambleton moved to a safer spot in the jungle and dug a hole to hide in until morning. During the night, Nail 59 and King 27, an HC-130 commanded by Maj. Dennis Constant, stayed. They suddenly found themselves painted by Fan Song radar and narrowly missed getting shot down as well. At 53 years old, Hambleton was not a prime candidate to survive the cold, wet weather conditions. = No fire zone = The Joint Search and Rescue Command (JSARC) was under the direction of the director of aerospace rescue, Col. Cecil Muirhead, who could restrict airspace activity for the use of search and rescue forces. He also commanded all the dedicated assets needed to assist with SAR. Muirhead ordered 24-hour forward air control (FAC) coverage around Hambleton's position to watch over him and soften up the North Vietnamese positions around him. To protect the downed airmen and the search and rescue forces, Muirhead also ordered the 7th Air Force to establish a standard no- fire zone around Hambleton. It prohibited friendly artillery, naval gunfire, or aircraft from engaging any target in the zone without JSARC approval. Three North Vietnamese divisions were attacking and the 3rd ARVN could not reply for several hours with artillery or request tactical air strikes in the area. = More aircraft lost = HH-53B of the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron refueling from a HC-130P over North Vietnam, 1969-70. On 3 April, air search and rescue forces attempted a first light rescue, which can successfully achieve surprise with minimal force. A search and rescue crew took off from the 37th AARS based at Nakhon Phanom, Thailand. It consisted of two HH-53 rescue helicopters, Jolly Green 65 and 67, and two A-1 Skyraiders, Sandy 07 and 08. Sandy 05 and 06 joined them on the scene. The area was covered in a solid overcast, preventing visual control of air strikes by the on-scene OV-10A FAC, Nail 25. Capt. Rocky Smith and Capt. Rick Atchison coordinated the work of several F-4s who were directed to drop CBU-42 anti- personnel cluster bombs around Hambleton to help protect his position. When Nail 25 ran low on fuel, it was replaced by an OV-10 (Nail 38) from the 23rd TASS flown by Capt. William J. Henderson (Nail 38 Alpha) and 1st Lt. Mark Clark (Nail 38 Bravo, and grandson of World War II General Mark Clark). The NVA had a listening post in the area and overheard the American radio traffic. They were very familiar with American SAR tactics and on the second day they began to use the downed flyer as bait. They positioned a number of anti- aircraft and surface-to-air missiles in the area near Hambleton. One pilot reported that \\"SAM calls were driving us into the small arms threat. Ground fire was accurate and well disciplined ... The NVA were very definitely monitoring and jamming our communications.\\" A U.S. Navy OV-10A Bronco from light attack squadron VAL-4 Black Ponies attacks a target with a \\"Zuni\\" rocket in the Mekong Delta, South Vietnam, c. 1969/70. Henderson obtained LORAN fixes on Hambleton's position. Coast Guard Lt. Commander Jay Crowe, an exchange pilot on assignment to the 37th ARRS at Da Nang, was piloting Jolly Green 65. The helicopter broke through the clouds and rapidly dropped into the area where Hambleton was hidden. The aircraft was immediately struck by a wall of North Vietnamese gunfire. Their rounds tore through the aircraft, destroying the instrument panel. Crowe struggled to get the aircraft out of the fire zone, and with his instruments shot up, he had to rely on external visual cues to fly the aircraft. He nursed the helicopter south and was able to get to the Phu Bai airfield. Jolly Green 66 flown by Lt. Colonel Bill Harris followed, only to break through the low ceiling to face ten North Vietnamese tanks and a withering onslaught of ground fire. He fought the controls to bring his rescue helicopter within of Hambleton, his gunners firing the airship's three GAU-2/A 7.62 mm (.308 in) six-barreled miniguns, engaging the North Vietnamese on every side. A pilot flying support, looking for targets to engage, asked, \\"Where's the enemy fire coming from?\\" Harris replied, \\"From !\\" Harris managed to get his badly damaged aircraft to gain altitude, then limp back to safety. Forced to fly in and out of cloud cover at perilously low altitudes, FAC Nail 38,FACs from Da Nang Air Force Based used the call signs Covey and Bilk, while aircraft from Nakhon Phanom used Nail. piloted by Henderson was hit by North Vietnamese fire and shot down. Henderson landed on the north side of the Song Meiu Giang, about from Hambleton. He hid in a bamboo patch until local villagers came looking for him and cut it down. He was taken north and became a POW. Clark parachuted to the ground safely on the south side of river and eluded capture. Later that same day, another UH-1H slick, unrelated to the rescue operation, was shot down in the same area carrying a crew of four. After pinpointing Hambleton's location, the Air Force bombarded the area around him for the next three days. On 4 April, a flight of ten Douglas A-1 Skyraiders, half the total available in all of South Vietnam, attempted to pave the way for a SAR team, and it was badly shot up. Eight of the ten aircraft were damaged, two severely. The damage significantly affected the availability of the Skyraiders. At dusk, Major Jimmy D. Kempton flying F-4D 66-0265 with the 390th TFS (Danang Gunfighters) and a wingman entered from the coast under a descending 500 foot ceiling and dropped BLU 52 SAR ordnance on four sides of Hambleton's location, the last of SAR ordnance on 4 April.As noted in Kempton's flight log book and in his citation for the Distinguished Flying Cross he was awarded for that day. On 5 April, bad weather prevented any SAR activity. On 6 April at 15:15, a third attempt was made to pick Hambleton and now Clark up. Four Douglas A-1 Skyraiders (Sandys 01, 02, 05, and 06) prepared the area around the survivors with extensive bombing and strafing. They were assisted by two HH53C helicopters (Jolly Green 67 and Jolly Green 60) from the 37th Air Rescue Squadron. During the day American fighters flew 52 sorties and four B-52 bombers bombed the area around Cam Lo. On 6 April, 80 SAMs were launched by the NVA in the area around Hambleton. It was estimated that Hambleton and Clark were in the midst of five or six NVA battalions. The NVA air defense seriously challenged American air superiority and blunted the success of close air support in the area. Capt. Peter Chapman volunteered to pilot Jolly Green 67, despite the fact that he was \\"short\\", due to return home very soon. Capt. Boli in Sandy 01 decided they would pick up Bat 21 Bravo (Hambleton) first and Nail 38 Bravo (Clark) immediately after. At 17:10, Sandy 03 joined the group with a full load of white phosphorus that could be used to lay down a smoke screen. Sandy 01 called in additional strikes on targets around Hambleton's position and re-checked the area. North Vietnamese response was limited. Aware that it could be a trap, he nonetheless gave the go-ahead. As Jolly Green 67 crossed the Song Meiu Giang with Jolly Green 60 high and above guarding their approach, Jolly Green 67 began taking fire from all sides. As it approached Hambleton's position, they called for him to pop his smoke and reveal his position. The aircraft was pummeled with automatic weapons and anti-aircraft fire from all quarters. Hambleton hesitated, and the Jolly Green tried to pull away. Despite the best efforts of the remaining aircraft, Jolly Green 67 was critically damaged. Jolly Green 67 flew east at first, further into territory held by the North Vietnamese, before it turned southeast for a few kilometers, when a fire broke out in the left engine. Pieces of the tail rotor struck the main rotor, and the aircraft rolled and crashed on its left side, burning ferociously. No rescue beepers were heard. The entire crew was listed as MIA and presumed killed: Capt. Peter Hayden Chapman II (pilot), Capt. John Henry Call III (co-pilot), TSgt. William Roy Pearson, TSgt. Allen J. Avery (para-rescuemen), TSgt. Roy D. Prater (crew chief), and Sgt. James Harold Alley (combat photographer). The fire consuming the helicopter was so hot it melted parts of the aircraft and continued to burn for three more days. Hambleton's and Clark's spirits sank when they realized that six men died while attempting to rescue them. After a stern sermon from the new on-scene commander Nail 32 Capt. John Van Etten, Hambleton decided, \\"Hell, I'm going to get out of this, regardless.\\" He camouflaged his hole, hiding there for seven nights and six days. He left the hole twice to scavenge for food and was almost caught the second time when he was spotted by a boy and his dog. NVA soldiers searching for him passed within of his hole twice. The SAR task force mission leader, Capt. Fred Boli in Sandy 01, called the rescue off for the time being because it was too dangerous. The remaining aircraft exited to the south across the Song Meiu Giang. The area was just too hot. Hambleton and Clark would have to spend another night behind the front lines. The North Vietnamese, alerted by the American's intense efforts to find the navigator, increased their efforts to find Hambleton. = NVA strength prevents air rescue = All of the SAR teams were experienced in conducting rescues into what they described as \\"hot LZs\\", but the airmen were shocked by the quantity and intensity of the ground and anti-aircraft fire they had faced since the rescue attempt began. This included not only small arms fire and the previously used 23mm, 37mm and 57mm towed guns, but the 85mm and 100mm towed guns, along with the self-propelled, radar-guided 57mm AAA gun. Most surprising to the Americans were the large presence of SA-2 SAMs, and for the first time the use of the Soviet SA-7 Grail shoulder-fired, heat-seeking SAM. Helicopter squadron commander Lt. Col. Bill Harris was upset. He concluded that the air rescue could not be attempted at that time due to the heavy concentration of North Vietnamese forces in the immediate area around Clark and Hambleton. He called Col. Muirhead and told him that they had to find another way. Hambleton was told to sit tight while they worked up an alternative plan. Hambleton had two survival radios, a first aid kit, two kinds of flares, a knife and a .38 caliber revolver, a compass and a map, an empty water bottle, but no food. On the morning of 7 April, 1st Lt. Bruce C. Walker accompanied by naval artillery spotter Marine Lt. Larry F. Potts were flying USAF OV-10A (Covey 282) from 20th Tactical Air Support Squadron. Potts was directing naval gunfire from the destroyer against Soviet-supplied North Vietnamese tanks to protect Hambleton. At 11:05, an O-1 Bird Dog pilot observed a SAM launch and Covey 282 was shot down west of Highway 1 and north of Highway 9. Radio contact was established with both Potts and Walker, and both reported that they were uninjured, but each man was too close to North Vietnamese forces to attempt a rescue. Clark hid on the south side of the Song Meiu Giang, while Walker was about north of Hambleton, who was on the north side of the river about from the town of Cam Lo. Clark evaded capture for a number of days and was in contact with SAR personnel when he warned them away due to the proximity of NVA forces. In January 1992, members of the Joint Task Force for Full Accounting examined war artifacts in the Hanoi military museum and found Bruce Walker's ID card. The disposition and location of Potts, Walker's backseat spotter, are unknown. It was Potts' 25th birthday. Potts was wounded and captured alive, but later died in Quang Binh prison.  Ground rescue  After five days and multiple attempts to rescue Hambleton, five aircraft had been shot down and another 16 seriously damaged, 10 service members had been killed or were missing in action, two were POWs, and two were behind front lines also waiting to be rescued. On 8 April, Gen. Creighton Abrams was briefed on the high losses in the several failed attempts to rescue Hambleton and Clark. He ordered that no further air CSAR would be attempted, but that given Hambleton's Top Secret clearance and knowledge of missiles and counter-measure technology, that every effort should be made to bring him out. USMC Col. Al Gray suggested a covert, land-based rescue operation. and Lt. Col. Andy Anderson, Commander of the Joint Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC, MACVSOG-80) ordered a ground rescue. In Saigon, Navy SEAL Lt. Thomas R. Norris, one of just three SEAL officers and nine enlisted men remaining in Vietnam, had just completed an assignment in the Mekong Delta. He was waiting for orders when the call came in for a commando operation to get Hambleton out. Norris was immediately dispatched to lead an operation to rescue Hambleton. He recruited five Vietnamese Sea Commando frogmen from the Lien Doc Nguoi Nhia (LDNN), Naval Advisory Detachment (NAD) in Da Nang. ARVN Brigadier General Vu Van Giai gave Anderson a Ranger platoon of about 20 men and three M-48 tanks that they used to set up a forward operating base along Highway QL-9 within observation range of the strategic Cam Lo Bridge. But Giai thought that the mission was insane and refused to take responsibility for the mission once they crossed the Song Meiu Giang. Anderson, who spoke Vietnamese, obtained additional intelligence from the headquarters of the 1st Armor Brigade near Dong Ha. = Ad hoc code used = The U.S. rescuers knew that the North Vietnamese were monitoring radio communications and understood English. Clark and Hambleton were several miles apart. A forward air controller told Clark, who was from Idaho, to \\"Get to the Snake, make like Esther Williams and float to Boston.\\" In other words, get to the river and swim east. Hambleton had a much more difficult task‚Äîto bypass North Vietnamese-occupied villages and gun emplacements. His rescuers learned that he was one of the best golfers in the Air Force and that he retained a detailed memory of the golf courses he had played. Improvising a code using a series of specific golf-course holes to guide him through the mine fields sown to protect him and to get him to the Song Meiu Giang, they radioed him, \\"You're going to play 18 holes and you're going to get in the Swanee and make like Esther Williams and Charlie the Tuna. The round starts on No. 1 at Tucson National.\\" Hambleton initially replied, \\"What have you been smoking?\\" But he broke the code. \\"It took me a half-hour to figure out they were giving me distance and direction,\\" Hambleton explained. \\"No. 1 at Tucson National is 408 yards running southeast. They wanted me to move southeast 400 yards. The 'course' would lead me to water.\\" Using the golf-course code, he was directed towards the Song Meiu Giang. To save time, Hambleton passed through the abandoned village that concealed the guns that shot down his would-be rescuers. Although the village had been bombed, he was confronted by a North Vietnamese soldier. Hambleton killed him using a knife in hand-to-hand combat. At one point, he was given directions to a \\"refreshment stand\\" where he would have to \\"tap his own keg\\". Physically exhausted, hungry and dehydrated, Hambleton found a banana plantation where he could tap the tree for drinking water. He got lost briefly, and then fell off a cliff, breaking his arm. The U.S. command in Saigon ordered special high- altitude B-52 bombing raids on nearby targets to divert the Vietnamese from searching for the two men, who were several miles apart. = Commandos cross lines = Lt.Thomas R. Norris and Petty Officer Third Class Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Ki·ªát went more than behind front lines disguised as fishermen in a sampan to rescue Lt. Col Iceal Hambleton. Norris was awarded the Medal of Honor and Nguy·ªÖn was recognized with the Navy Cross for their actions. Anderson now planned to rescue Hambleton and Clark. Norris and Anderson called in air strikes in an attempt to weaken the NVA's resistance, but the NVA answered with mortar rounds and B-40 rockets that struck the team's position. Lt. Col. Anderson, the senior American commander, and Lt. Tho Ngoc Vu, the senior Vietnamese commando, and all of the Vietnamese officers were hurt. The wounded Vietnamese troops had to be evacuated. One commando was killed. Norris was left with five Vietnamese commandos who spoke little English. OV-10 pilot Clark (Nail 38 Bravo) was seriously weakened by five days hiding from NVA forces with little to eat. Since he was closest to the team's position, Norris decided to rescue him first. The rescuer's initial plan was to swim upriver and meet Clark, but Norris tested the current and decided it was too strong. Clark was relayed instructions by the FAC controller overhead to get in the water after dark and float downstream where Norris and his team would intercept him. The rescue team would have to insert along the riverbank, a much more hazardous route. Anderson, Norris, and five Vietnamese commandos set up an overwatch position near the Mieu Giang River, which ran near the positions of both downed airmen. Anderson ordered Norris to take his team no more than forward and wait for the survivors to come to them, but after departing, Norris ignored the order and turned off his radio. Traveling twice that distance upriver, he passed through frequent North Vietnamese patrols, truck, and columns of tanks. Clark floated down the cold river and at about 02:00 to 03:00, Norris could hear his heavy breathing on the river. Norris was about to leave cover to pull Clark to shore when a six-man NVA patrol walked between them. Norris remained hidden, hoping they wouldn't notice Clark's breathing, and knowing that using their weapons would expose the team's position to the hundreds of enemy troops around them. By the time the patrol passed by, Clark had floated on downstream. Norris radioed Clark and instructed him to get out of the river on the south bank. On his own initiative, Norris left his team and swam downstream several hours looking for Clark. Near dawn, he saw some motion and found Clark hiding behind a sampan on the riverbank. Norris had to persuade Clark to follow him and was finally able to re-link up with the rest of his team. Norris delivered Clark to Anderson at the forward operating base. Clark was transported to the last outpost on the Cua Viet River at Dong Ha by an ARVN M113 armored personnel carrier and then flown to Da Nang. On 9 April, Hambleton's eighth day of evading NVA forces all around him, FAC Harold Icke on Bilk 11 kept in constant contact with Hambleton. Icke directed Sandy 01 to drop a Madden survival pack containing food, water, ammunition and extra radios to Hambleton, but it fell away, slightly above him, and he was too weak to climb up to it. Icke and the pilots of two A-1 Skyraiders were shocked to see Hambleton come out his hiding place and stand in the open on a sandbar in the river, waving a white flag at them above. Icke knew Hambleton's mental and physical health were precarious. Unknown to him, Hambleton was considerably weakened, having lost in the 10 days since his jet had been shot down. On 11 April, Hambleton (Bat 21 Bravo) was too weak to move any farther. Norris was well aware of the overwhelming North Vietnamese presence, but decided to proceed upriver again. Hambleton wasn't transmitting on schedule and his occasional radio calls were difficult to understand. Norris could only follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but knew he would have to go to him. North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to destroy them before the team launched their second rescue mission. The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured mortar and artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning. Norris was left with only three Vietnamese commandos. During their search for Hambleton on the night of 12 April, they headed upriver more than , slipping through a massive NVA force. During the night, upon seeing the extremely large number of North Vietnamese forces, two of the commandos declined to advance further, saying they \\"refused to follow an American just to rescue an American\\". Norris convinced them to stay by persuading them that the only way they would get back to safety was to stay with the team. They cautiously searched the river shore for two more hours without success and reluctantly returned to their forward operating base to rest and hope they would be more successful the next night. Icke fixed Hambleton's position during the day so Norris could find him that night. On the night of 13 April, Norris didn't dare take the two ARVN soldiers who had faltered the night before. He was prepared to go alone when Petty Officer Third Class Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Ki·ªát volunteered to go with him. Norris bluntly told Nguy·ªÖn that he wasn't sure either one of them would return. They worked their way slowly upriver until they came upon an empty, destroyed village. They found clothing and an abandoned sampan. Nguy·ªÖn and Norris, who was slightly built, donned Vietnamese clothing and disguised themselves as fishermen. They rowed quietly up river, but even in the pitch dark and dense fog they could see large numbers of North Vietnamese soldiers and tanks on the shoreline. Stopping to check his map at one point, Norris suddenly realized that two NVA soldiers were sitting about away. However, they were asleep. Traveling upriver in the sampam, they broke out of the heavy fog and found themselves about from their starting point, under the Cam Lo bridge. They had passed Hambleton's position more than 30 minutes ago. Turning around, they worked their way south before putting ashore and began to search for Hambleton. They finally found him sitting in a clump of bushes, alive but partly delirious and extremely weakened, having eaten only four small ears of corn in 12 days and having lost since his plane was shot down. He weighed only . Sunrise was coming, and although Norris thought it best to wait until dark to return downriver, Hambleton needed to be evacuated immediately. Despite the risk, Norris and Nguy·ªÖn hid Hambleton in the bottom of the sampan, covered him with bamboo, and started downriver. = Daylight evacuation = After his rescue, Iceal Hambleton is moved on a stretcher before his transfer to a hospital in Da Nang. Their sampan was soon spotted by North Vietnamese troops, some of whom fired at them, but Norris and Nguy·ªÖn could not afford to return fire. They paddled furiously, using the current and dense foliage along the far side of the river to their advantage, and trying to out-distance the soldiers. However, when they rounded a bend in the river, the NVA fired on them with a heavy caliber machine gun. They pulled the sampan to the bank and turned it over to provide some cover. Icke in Bilk 11 overhead called in air support and five U.S. Navy A-4 Skyhawks led by Lt. Denny Sapp from the carrier Hancock killed a number of North Vietnamese troops and provided cover for his final escape. Two A-1 Skyraiders also assisted, dropping both explosives and MK47 smoke bombs, providing a smokescreen. Returning to the river, the three men were soon able to receive support from South Vietnamese forces. Landing on the river bank, they were met by some ARVN soldiers. Hambleton was unable to walk and they carried him back to their bunker. There, an M113 armored personnel carrier carried Hambleton, Norris and Nguyen back to Brigade Headquarters in Dong Ha. News reporters were very aware of the intense rescue efforts to bring Hambleton home. When the rescue team and Hambleton arrived at Dong Ha, a reporter commented to Norris, \\"It must have been tough out there. I bet you wouldn't do that again.\\" Norris replied, \\"An American was down in enemy territory. Of course I'd do it again.\\" From Dong Ha, Hambleton was transported via US Army 571st Dustoff helicopter, Lt. Ken Warner Aircraft Commander (Dustoff 502) to 95th Evacuation Hospital, Da Nang. He was shortly afterward evacuated to the hospital at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines where he recuperated for a month. Norris began to plan for the rescue of Walker, still more than a kilometer behind front lines. Walker managed to evade capture for almost 11 days when on the night of 18 April, without FAC coverage, he moved on his own accord and ran into a local villager who alerted the North Vietnamese. They began tracking him and the next morning the FAC saw NVA very near Walker's position. Walker radioed the FAC that rescue should not be attempted because NVA forces were closing in and he was under fire. Bilk 36, an OV-10A flown by FAC 1st Lt. Mickey Fain, reported that Walker was surrounded by more than 20 NVA soldiers and shortly afterward saw his body lying in the grass. Walker's body was never recovered.  Rescue cost  There were no rules to apply to determine when a search and rescue was no longer cost effective. = SAR priority = The Air Force remained fully committed to finding and bringing back every downed air man, regardless of the cost. Air crew's morale depended on it. Search and rescue was based on the premise that it was necessary \\"to secure the safety of pilots as valuable military assets and to enhance their effectiveness by boosting morale.\\" On 2 June 1972, General John Vogt, commander of the 7th Air Force, sent a huge task force of 119 aircraft to rescue Capt. Roger Locher, an F-4 weapons officer who during Operation Linebacker had been shot down only from Hanoi. When he was picked up by a HH-53 from the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, he was within of the heavily defended Y√™n B√°i Air Base and had eluded capture while covering in North Vietnamese territory for 23 days. There were also political overtones to Hambleton's rescue. \\"U.S. personnel held as prisoners of war constituted a serious political liability to the U.S. government.\\" As many as 90 sorties a day were called in to suppress North Vietnamese forces around Hambleton. In contrast, prior to the Easter Offensive, the number of daily sorties was about 10, and during the action, peaked at about 300. During the multi-day effort to rescue the men, the Americans hit the North Vietnamese with over 800 air strikes in direct support of the rescue. Search and rescue took priority over almost all strike targets. = No-fire zone enforced = To protect the downed airmen and the search and rescue forces, Col. Cecil Muirhead ordered the 7th Air Force to establish a standard no-fire zone around Hambleton shortly after he went down. It remained in effect until 22:00, and while in force it prohibited friendly artillery, naval gunfire, or aircraft from engaging any target within without JSARC approval. The no-fire zone encompassed nearly the entire combat zone of the ARVN 3rd Division including the crucial Cam Lo Bridge. As a result, the South Vietnamese Army in the area was severely hampered in its efforts to stem the NVA offensive against Dong Ha and Quang Tri City. During this six-hour period, thousands of NVA troops pushed into the region, designated Military Region 1. When it was seen that NVA forces were pouring through the gap unimpeded, the no-fire zone was reduced at 22:00 that night, but not before the action generated considerable debate. One ranking adviser commented, \\"When viewed in relation to all the events of the day, a worse decision could not have been made.\\" The 3rd ARVN had lost most of its artillery in the first two days of the offensive, and in fact had surrendered two of their batteries intact to the NVA. Hambleton commented after the war, \\"If the taxpayers and my neighbors knew what it cost to pull me out of there, they'd probably shoot me.\\" Maj. David A. Brookbank, a U.S. Air Force liaison with the 3rd Division, reported, \\"The operation cost the 3rd ARVN dearly.\\" He concluded that the restriction gave the North Vietnamese \\"an opportunity unprecedented in the annals of warfare to advance at will.\\" He stated, \\"It seems logical to assume that many South Vietnamese troops died because air and artillery support were not available.\\" He warned his superiors that the 3rd Division's officers resented the fact that the 7th Air Force would put thousands of South Vietnamese soldiers' lives at risk to rescue one of their own. American response to the NVA operation virtually ground to a halt as air resources were diverted to support the recovery, and for a few days defense of the northern border area was second in priority to rescuing Hambleton. = Casualties = As a direct result of the rescue operation, five aircraft were lost, 11 people were killed, and two were captured. Additional aircraft were seriously damaged. Hambleton wrote from an Air Force hospital after he was rescued, \\"I had to stand by and watch six young men die trying to save my life. It was a hell of a price to pay for one life. I'm very sorry.\\" His rescue was, according to Stars and Stripes, \\"the biggest U.S. air rescue effort of the war.\\" During the Vietnam War, search and rescue forces saved 3,883 lives at the cost of 71 rescuers and 45 aircraft.  Aftermath  The rescue of Bat 21 was a watershed event for the military and led them to find a new approach to high-threat search and rescue. They recognized that, if a SAR mission was predestined to fail, it should not be attempted, and other options, such as special operations, diversionary tactics and other creative approaches tailored to the situation, had to be considered. Recognizing the need for an aircraft that could deliver better close air support, the Air Force accepted the Navy's A-7 Corsair. The military also improved the night capability of helicopters and area denial munitions. = Awards and recognition = John Van Etten (Nail 32) received the Distinguished Flying Cross for his part in this rescue. Jimmy D Kempton received the Distinguish Flying Cross for his BLU-52 suppression mission flown on 4 April, Hambleton received the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal (United States) and a Purple Heart for his actions during this mission. For their heroic actions in rescuing Hambleton behind front lines, Lt. Thomas R. Norris was recommended for and received the Medal of Honor, although he initially declined to submit the paperwork. Norris readily supported the nomination of Petty Officer Third Class Nguyen Van Kiet for the Navy Cross, the highest award that the navy can give to a foreign national. Nguyen was the only South Vietnamese Naval member awarded the Navy Cross during the Vietnam War, and one of only two South Vietnamese to receive the award. Navy investigators reviewed the action, interviewed participants, and recommended Norris for the Medal of Honor. He received it from President Gerald Ford in a White House ceremony on 6 March 1976 attended by Michael Thornton, another Navy SEAL who had saved Norris' life on 31 October 1972. Hundreds of individuals from dozens of units from the Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard assisted in Hambleton's rescue,and participants in the operation received a total of 234 individual medals. In 1975, Clark's and Hambleton's rescue was declassified. = POW release and recovery of the dead = Astorga and Henderson were released in March 1973 after the war ended. The remains of the rest of the crew of Bat 21, Hambleton's EB-66E Destroyer, Bolte, Gatwood, Giannangeli, Levis and Serex, have not been recovered. Gatwood left behind a 13-week-old son he had never seen, Robin F. Gatwood III. The remains of Kulland, Frink and Paschall were recovered and returned to the United States in 1995, where they were buried at Arlington National Cemetery. The bodies of Potts and Walker have not been recovered to date. The remains of the crew members of HH-53C Jolly Roger 67, Chapman, Call, Avery, Prater, Pearson and Alley, were returned to the United States on 1 October 1997. The six were honored on 19 November 1997 in a full military funeral at Arlington National Cemetery and a headstone commemorating all six airmen was placed at the site. Hambleton was unable to attend due to poor health, but a letter from him was read. He wrote, \\"They deserve all the accolades that we, the living, can bestow upon them. Again, I thank them, I honor them, and I will always hold great faith in my heart with them.\\" Clark was present. He told the families of the downed fliers that \\"Each of you played a distinct role and forming the character of these men who so willingly paid a very dear price to help me get out of the jungles of Vietnam. You have my deepest sympathy‚Äîyou and these six brave men.\\" Prater's remains were buried with full military honors on 19 June 2010 by his family. Alley had two weeks remaining on his tour of duty before returning home. He was buried with full military honors in Florida. Avery's remains were buried with full military honors on 6 April 2012. Advancements in DNA testing allowed the Department of Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office to officially identify his remains and release them to his family for service at his final resting place.  In popular culture  Fifteen years after the rescue, the USAF held a symposium at Nellis Air Force Base and invited all those directly involved. John Van Etten, whose call sign was Nail 32, had never met Iceal \\"Gene\\" Hambleton in person. When he stepped on stage and put out his hand to Gene, he said, \\"Hello, Gene, I'm John Van Etten,\\" and Gene replied, \\"No, you're not. ... you are Nail 32, I would recognize that voice anywhere!\\" Two books were written about the search and rescue operation to bring Hambleton out alive: the first was Bat-21 (1985) by William C. Anderson, and the second, published after considerable classified information was released, The Rescue of Bat 21 (1999) by Darrel D. Whitcomb. The Lt. Thomas R. Norris building at Naval Special Warfare Group Two in Little Creek, Virginia was named for Norris. The film Bat*21, starring Gene Hackman as Hambleton, was a dramatized depiction of Hambleton's rescue, based on some of the actual events; Anderson assisted in the screenwriting of the film. Tom Norris' role in the rescue was still secret, and his actions were not depicted in the film. His rescue was featured in the Vietnam episode of the television series Navy Seals: Untold Stories in 2001.

While nutrition was always part of the curriculum at the university, the department was initiated when the School of Public Health was begun in 1963.  Nut Studies The Department of Nutrition is notable for its landmark research on the health and nutrition properties of nuts. Department Chair Dr. Joan Sabat√© discovered the link between nut consumption and protection from the risk of cardiovascular disease. The outcomes of his research were published in 1993 in the New England Journal of Medicine. In 2010, findings from a pooled analysis of 25 intervention trials with nuts, compiled by Dr. Sabat√©, was published by the Archives of Internal Medicine. This confirmed the original research and established that the consumption of nuts improves blood lipid levels and provides heart health protection.http://archinte.ama- assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/170/9/821 The department has conducted research on almonds, peanuts, pecans, walnuts and nuts in general and includes both clinical intervention studies and epidemiological studies. Results from 19 separate inquiries are available at the department website on their nut studies.http://www.nutstudies.org/  Vegetarian Research  The Department of Nutrition at Loma Linda University has dedicated extensive research to examining the nutrition and health effects of plant foods and plant based diet patterns. Research also includes assessing the safety, adequacy and optimacy of vegetarian eating patterns as well as assessing the potential impact of animal vs plant foods on nutrition, microbial contamination and sanitary concerns, and on the environment.http://www.llu.edu/public- health/nutrition/research.page? Every five years, beginning in 1992, Loma Linda University sponsors the International Congress on Vegetarian Nutrition. The 5th congress, held March 4‚Äì6, 2008 was attended by over 700 research and health professionals from over 40 countries. Dr. Joan Sabat√© has chaired the last two congresses and Nutrition Department faculty have served as chair of the scientific program. Proceedings from these congresses have been published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and are available through the congress website.http://www.vegetariannutrition.org/index.html Two vegetarian resources have been produced from department research. Dr. Joan Sabat√© is editor of the book Vegetarian Nutrition. This book contains expert summaries of various aspects of a plant-based diet. It provides not only ethical, moral, and religious viewpoints from different periods of history but also modern perspectives on health promotion and disease prevention. The department has also produced a Vegetarian Food Pyramid, a 4-page brochure that includes guidelines for healthful vegetarian diets, serving guides and other recommended lifestyle habits. Academics The Loma Linda University School of Public Health, Department of Nutrition provides programs leading to the Master of Public Health (MPH) and the Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) degrees. These two degrees include a field practicum component and prepare students to sit for the registration examination of the Commission on Dietetic Registration to become a registered dietitian. The department also offers the Master of Science (MS) degree in nutrition through the Faculty of Graduate Studies in the areas of nutritional science and clinical nutrition.http://www.llu.edu/public-health/nutrition/index.page?

Fall River Station will be built on a line that was once part of the original Fall River Railroad and Old Colony & Newport Railway.  South Coast Rail  In September 2008, MassDOT released 18 potential station sites for the South Coast Rail project, including Fall River Depot off Davol Street. A 2009 conceptual design called for a single side platform serving the west track, with a second track allowing freight trains to pass the high-level platform; a two-story parking deck would be located on the west side of the tracks. Plans released as part of the Final Environmental Impact Report in 2013 were nearly identical. On June 11, 2010, the state took ownership of the Fall River Subdivision and several other CSX lines as part of a sale agreement. In 2017, the project was re-evaluated due to cost issues. A new proposal released in March 2017 called for early service via Middleborough by 2024, followed by full service via Stoughton by 2029. The January 2018 Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report reconfigured the planned parking lot configuration, with surface lots on both sides of the tracks, as part of the previously planned deck site had been developed for use by a business.

The seminary is the first and only Chaldean Catholic seminary outside of Iraq. The seminary is part of the Eparchy of St. Peter the Apostle, a diocese which encompasses 19 of the westernmost states of the United States. The seminary was consecrated by Mar Sarhad Yawsip Jammo on July 25, 2008. Fr. Andrew Younan was appointed as the seminary's rector and Mar Bawai Soro was assigned to the post of spiritual director for those discerning the priesthood. The seminary proper has dorms for as many as 10 men, and there is another building on the land which is the Institute of Mar Abba the Great which is home to a chapel, library, and a classroom. Patron saint: Mar Abba the Great The seminary's patron saint, for whom the Seminary was named, was a convert from Zoroastrianism. The man who would later become the Patriarch of the Church of the East was the secretary of the governor of a Persian province when he met a Christian during one of his journeys. He was so impressed by the Christian's simplicity and humility that he began to talk to him and eventually became a Christian himself. He soon became a monk and made a pilgrimage to visit much of the Western Christian world, including Jerusalem, Egypt, Greece and Constantinople, with his friend Toma, where they were received with great enthusiasm as holy men and fine scholars. Mar Abba became Patriarch in 540, a time of great interior and exterior turmoil in the Church, but despite the disasters before him, he faced his Patriarchate with great brilliance and nobility. He visited every diocese and dealt fairly with any divisions, he revived both monasticism and Christian scholarship, creating educational systems for the simple faithful as well as theological universities, and he returned the Church, through his policies and his personal example, to its original purity and simplicity, all in the course of a 12-year Patriarchate, during most of which he was either in prison or in exile for defying the Zoroastrian authorities. At his Synod in 544, Mar Abba solidified the internal reorganization of the Church of the East and reached out enthusiastically for unity with the Western Church. After his death in February 552, the faithful carried his casket from his simple home across the Tigris to the monastery of Mar Pithyon.

She was launched in 1794 and was in active service until 1811. Her most famous action was the capture of the French brig Ligurienne when shortly after Peterel captured two merchant ships and sent them off with prize crews, three French ships attacked her. She drove two on shore and captured the largest, the 14-gun Ligurienne. The Navy converted Peterel to a receiving ship at Plymouth in 1811 and sold her in 1827. Design and construction Peterel was part of the six-ship Pylades-class of ship-sloops designed by Sir John Henslow. The ship was built by John Wilson & Company of Frindsbury, and measured 365 tons bm with a total length of 105ft 1in. She was initially armed with 16 6-pound guns and 4 ¬Ω-pounder swivel guns and carried a complement of 121 men. She was later re-armed with sixteen 24-pounder carronades on the upper deck, with six 12-pounder carronades on the quarterdeck and two 12-pounder carronades on the forecastle. The ship was ordered on 18 February 1793, laid down in May 1793 and launched on 4 April 1794. She moved to Chatham to be fitted-out and have her hull covered with copper plates between 4 April and July 1794; at her completion she had cost ¬£7,694 to build including fitting. Service Peterel was commissioned in April 1794 under Commander Stephen Church. In October Commander Edward Leveson-Gower replaced Church, only to be replaced in turn in July 1795 by Commander Charles Ogle. Peterel was at this stage assigned to the squadron in the Downs. Commander John Temple succeeded Ogle in January 1796. By 31 May Peterel had joined Horatio Nelson's squadron patrolling off Genoa. On that day Peterel was part of a small squadron under Nelson in that captured six French vessels that were carrying military supplies from Toulon to St. Piere d'Acena for the siege of Mantua. In July she was under the command of Captain Stuart. Stuart and Peterel directed the landing of troops for the capture of Porto Ferrajo on 10 July. Commander Philip Wodehouse had taken command of Peterel by December 1796 when Peterel landed a small party under Lieutenant Thomas Staines on the coast of Corsica. The landing party attacked a Martello tower, which they captured, and threw its gun, a long 32-pounder, over the cliff.The Gentleman's magazine, (September 1830), pp.277-80. Peterels next captain, Commander William Proby, took over in March 1797. In June 1797 Proby authorised Staines to take 20 men in two of the ship's boats to cut out a French privateer that had been preying on merchant vessels off the coast of Tuscany. After a skirmish in which the British had five men wounded and the French lost several dead and wounded, the British took the privateer, which had a crew of 45 men and was armed with two long guns and several swivels. By August Commander Thomas Caulfield had replaced Proby. Under Caulfield's command Peterel was involved in the capture of the French privateer L√©opard on 30 April 1798. Leopard was armed with twelve 6-pounder guns and 14 swivel guns. She had a crew of 100 men and had been on the prowl for 20 days, but without having captured anything. At some later stage she was commanded by Lieutenant Adam Drummond, who was followed by Commander Henry Digby. In September 1798, Digby sailed from Gibraltar to Faro, Portugal, to deliver despatches from Earl St. Vincent for the Lisbon packet. Staines took the six men in Peterels jolly boat to deliver the despatches to the packet when the jolly boat overturned in heavy seas. Four men drowned and Staines and the other man were only rescued after four hours. Digby's replacement in October that year was to be Commander Hugh Downman, but in November Captain George Long was in command, serving with John Duckworth's squadron at Menorca. Capture and recapture Peterel participated in the Capture of Menorca (1798) by the British expedition under Commodore John Duckworth. On 12 November 1798 the Spanish 40-gun frigate Flora, in company with the 40-gun Proserpina and the 34-gun ships Pomona and Casilda, captured Peterel whilst she was operating off Menorca. One of the Spanish ships fired a broadside after she surrendered.Marshall p.81 After removing the prisoners from the ship, the Spanish plundered their clothes and possessions, murdering a seaman who attempted to defend his property. Duckworth detached to pursue the sloop and on 13 November she retook Peterel and her 72-man Spanish prize crew, which was under the command of Don Antonio Franco Gandrada, Second Captain of Flora. Captain James Bowen of Argo put his own prize crew of 46 officers seamen and marines aboard Peterel. Duckworth later appointed his first lieutenant, George Jones, to command Peterel. Most of the clothes belonging to Captain Long and his officers were subsequently recovered.James/Chamier p.197 This charge of ill-usage was officially contradicted in the Madrid Gazette of 12 April, but was, nevertheless, essentially true.Commander George Long received command of the then newly- captured Spanish brig in November 1799. He would die at the siege of Porto Ferrajo in 1801. The Spanish squadron, already being chased the next day by several British ships, completely outsailed their pursuers and returned to Cartagena with the prisoners.Cust p.154 After a detention of 14 days at Cartagena, Lieutenant Staines and his fellow prisoners were embarked in a merchant brig bound to M√°laga; but they did not arrive there until 24 December, a westerly wind having obliged the vessel to anchor off Almeria, where she was detained upwards of three weeks, and her passengers confined on shore during that period.Marshall p.82. From M√°laga, the British were marched to Gibraltar, under a strong escort of soldiers, who treated both officers and men with great brutality, but particularly Lieutenant Staines, who had received a sabre wound in the wrist whilst parrying a blow which one of those soldiers had aimed at his head. On their arrival at the rock, a court-martial was assembled to investigate the circumstances attending their capture by the Spanish squadron; and as no blame could be attached to any individual, the whole of them were sent back to the Peterel immediately after their acquittal. Resumed service On 3 February 1799 Francis Austen, the brother of author Jane Austen and future admiral of the fleet, took command of Peterel. Peterel and Austen shared in the proceeds of the capture on 18 June 1799 of the French frigates , Alceste, and Junon, and the brigs Alerte and Salamine. Under Austen, Peterel captured or cut out from ports an armed galley, a transport brig carrying cannons and ammunition, and some twenty merchant vessels. In May 1799 Peterel carried the news to Lord Nelson at Palermo, Sicily, that a large enemy fleet had passed through the straits of Gibraltar. On the evening of 1 August 1799, at 9 P.M., s boats came alongside Peterel. Austen sent these boats and his own to cut out some vessels from the Bay of Diano, near Genoa. Firing was heard at around midnight and by morning the boats returned, bringing with them a large settee carrying wine, and the Virginie. Virginie was a Turkish-built half-galley that the French had captured at Malta the year before. She had provision for 26 oars and carried six guns. She was under the command of a lieutenant de vaisseau and had a crew of 36 men, 20 of whom had jumped overboard when the British approached, and 16 of whom the British captured. She had brought General Joubert from Toulon and was going on the next day to Genoa where Joubert was to replace General Moreau in command of the French army in Italy.Molland's Circulating Library, \\"Jane Austen's Sailor Brothers. Chapter 6, The Patrol of the Mediterranean\\". Minerve and Peterel shared the proceeds of the capture of Virginie with and . Ligurienne under way. In March 1800, Peterel was sailing near Marseille with the frigate . On 21 March, Peterel spotted a large convoy with three escorts: the brig-sloop French brig Ligurienne, armed with fourteen brass 6-pounder guns and two brass 36-pounder howitzers, the corvette Cerf, of fourteen 6-pounder guns, and the xebec Lejoille, of six 6-pounder guns. Peterel captured a bark of 350 tons and a bombarde (ketch) of 150 tons, both carrying wheat and which their crews had abandoned, and sent them off with prize crews; later that afternoon the escorts caught up to Peterel and attacked. Mermaid was in sight but a great distance to leeward and so unable to assist. Single-handedly, Peterel drove Cerf and Lejoille on shore, and after a 90-minute battle captured Ligurienne, which lost the French commander (lieutenant de vaisseaux Citoyen Francis Auguste Pelabon), and one sailor killed and two sailors wounded out of her crew of 104 men; there were no British casualties. Cerf was a total loss but the French were able to salvage Lejoille. The whole action took place under the guns of two shore batteries and so close to shore that Peterel grounded for a few minutes. Austen recommended, without success, that the Navy purchase Ligurienne, which was less than two years old. In 1847 the Admiralty authorised the issue of the Naval General Service medal with clasp \\"Peterel 21 March 1800\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. On 14 April 1800 Peterel and captured St. Rosalia. Peterel went on to take part in operations against the French forces in Egypt. On 13 August 1800, Peterel was sailing towards Alexandria when she spied a Turkish 80-gun ship of the line totally dismasted and aground near Aboukir Bay, with three Turkish frigates standing offshore, out of range of any French guns on shore. Some of the Turkish crew of the ship of the line had reached the frigates, but the captain and most of the crew had surrendered to the French. Austen sent in a pinnace and ten men who set fire to the Turkish ship to forestall any further French attempts to plunder it, especially of its guns and ammunition.James (1837), Vol. 3, pp.36-7. Commander Charles Inglis officially replaced Austen in June 1800, but apparently did not actually take command until some months later. On 8 March 1801, Peterel, , and another sloop supported the British landing at Abu Qir Bay by stationing themselves close in with their broadsides towards the shore.James (1837), Vol. 3, p.100. Peterel and drove a Greek caicque onshore on 11 March at Tower of Arabs. The vessel was on her way to Alexandria. Because Peterel served in the navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March to 2 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorized in 1850 for all surviving claimants. In July‚ÄìAugust 1802, Peterel was part of a small anti-smuggling squadron under the command of Captain King, of . who further had command of a small squadron on anti-smuggling duties. The other vessels in the squadron were , , and .Naval Chronicle, Vol. 8, p.172. Napoleonic Wars From 29 April 1802 until 1809 Peterel was under Commander John Lamborn. In May 1804, she sailed for Jamaica and Barbados, convoying the West Indies trade, and thereafter remained in the West Indies for some years. She destroyed a small privateer on the Jamaica station on 23 January 1805. The privateer was a felucca, armed with one 4-pounder gun and a swivel gun. She had a crew of 27 men, all except one of whom escaped after they ran her on shore and before Peterels boats arrived to burn her. The privateer had captured an American brig which she had sent into Havana where the brig was sold. On 8 February, Pique captured the Spanish warship Urquixo, of 18 guns and 82 men. Peterel shared in the proceeds. On 13 May Peterell captured the Spanish privateer schooner Santa Anna off Cuba. Santa Anna was armed with one long 18-pounder gun and four 6-pounder guns, and had a crew of 106 men. She had sailed from Santiago de Cuba only the day before and had not yet captured anything. At some point in 1805 or 1806, Peterel captured the ship Hoffnung, in sight of the armed schooner Arab, Lieutenant Carpenter, commander. In early October 1806, Peterel was part of a convoy from Jamaica. Near North Edisto she encountered the French privateer Superbe, of 14 guns and 150 men. The privateer mistook Peterel for a guineaman and attempted to board. Peterel repulsed the attempt and then gave chase as Captain Dominique Houx (or Diron) of Superbe realized his mistake and made his escape. In the skirmish, Lieutenant Maitland of Peterel was killed, and four seamen were wounded. Peterel captured one of the French boarders who reported that a broadside from Peterel had killed some 30 to 40 men on Superbe as she came up to board.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 15, pp.301-2. On 27 October, , under the command of Lieutenant William Fitton, caught up with Superbe in Ocoa Bay after a 50-hour chase. Pitt captured Superbe, with Drake in sight, after Houx ran her aground. Houx and most of his crew escaped, though a number had been killed in the running battle with Pitt. Fate Peterel was fitted as a receiving ship at Plymouth in August 1811 and served in that capacity until 1825. Peterel was put up sale at Plymouth on 11 July 1827, and sold that same day to Joshua Crystall at Plymouth for ¬£730.

Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 Design and development The Annebula design is derived from the Cherokee II, but while retaining the basic Cherokee structure, Leonard incorporated many changes and new features. The aircraft is built from wood and fiberglass, with aircraft fabric covering. The Annebula uses a completely new single-spar wing with Prue-type trailing edge dive brakes. The airfoil is a NACA laminar flow type of varying section over the span, starting at the wing root as a NACA 64(3)-618, becoming a NACA 64(3)-615 by mid-span and then a NACA 4412 at the tip. The wing is constructed from plywood and fiberglass and is responsible for the Annebula's performance increase from the Cherokee II's 23:1 glide ratio to 31.5:1. The Annebula also has more span, wing loading and a higher aspect ratio than the Cherokee II. The fuselage was also extensively redesigned, with a new shaped nose, a new vertical fin with twice the area and a new fuselage shape aft of the wing. Landing gear is a monowheel. Only one Annebula was built. Operational history Completed in 1967, the Annebula is registered as a US experimental amateur-built. By 1983 the sole example had flown over 700 hours and had been used to complete Diamond badge distance and altitude flights. It also once held the Kansas state records for speed attained in , and triangles, goal distance, altitude and altitude gain. Aside from the designer himself, Leonard's three sons have also flown the aircraft.

Career Pasolini, an Italian count and a nephew of Luchino Visconti, worked as an investment banker in England for 12 years. He wished to work on the film The Killing Fields, was interviewed by David Puttnam, and was rejected. When Puttnam went to Bangkok to shoot the film, Pasolini bought his own ticket and presented himself on set seeking work. Puttnam was impressed by this persistence and brought him on board the project. Pasolini subsequently acted as location scout for The Killing Fields (1984), The Frog Prince, and The Mission (1986). He was an assistant director with producer's duties on The Frog Prince (for which he also assisted in translations while shooting in Paris), and The Mission. Pasolini moved to Los Angeles when Puttnam was appointed as head of Columbia Pictures, and was vice president of production, and in 1988 oversaw production of both David Mamet's Things Change and Emir Kusturica's Time of the Gypsies. Later in 1988, Pasolini returned to London and rejoined Enigma Films to serve as associate producer on Meeting Venus (1991), and as producer on A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia for an episode of the TV series Great Performances. In 1994 Pasolini left Enigma and founded Redwave Films as a production company to produce the film Palookaville for which he chose David Epstein to write the screenplay and Alan Taylor to direct, In 1997, Pasolini received international recognition as producer of the film The Full Monty. He conceived the idea for the film and chose Simon Beaufoy to write the screenplay and Peter Cattaneo to direct. In 2000, Pasolini asked Aileen Ritchie to direct the William Ivory film The Closer You Get, and in 2001 produced The Emperor's New Clothes. Pasolini's next film was inspired by a real event. In 2004, in order to get visas granting them access to an international handball tournament being held in Bavaria, 23 Sri Lankan men fooled the German embassy in Colombo into believing they were the Sri Lanka National Handball team. The men then travelled to Germany on the pretext of taking part in the sports tournament, but were in fact seeking to emigrate. They postponed their escape and actually took part in several handball matches held by the Asian-German Sports Exchange Program before vanishing. When Pasolini heard of the incident, he decided to make it into a film to promote discussion on the issue of illegal immigration, and in 2008 he released the critically acclaimed Machan, marking his directorial debut. Following Machan was Pasolini's Redwave Films production, Bel Ami, starring Robert Pattinson, Uma Thurman, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Christina Ricci, which was based upon the novel of the same name by Guy de Maupassant. The film had its world premiere out of competition at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival in February 2012. The 2013 film Still Life, starring Eddie Marsan and Joanne Froggatt, is his second film as director. In 1995, Pasolini married the composer Rachel Portman with whom he has worked on several of his film projects. The two have three children. =Filmography= As producer * Meeting Venus (1991) * Great Performances (1 episode, 1992) (TV) * Palookaville (1995) * The Full Monty (1997) * The Closer You Get (2000) * The Emperor's New Clothes (2001) * Machan (2008) * Bel Ami (2011) * Still Life (2013) As writer/director * The Frog Prince (1986) (third assistant director) * The Mission (1986) (third assistant director) * Machan (2008) * Still Life (2013) * Nowhere Special (2020) Recognition =Awards and nominations= * 1997, Won European Film Award for Best Film for The Full Monty * 1998, Won BAFTA Film Award for Best Film for The Full Monty * 1998, Won Nova Award for Most Promising Producer in Theatrical Motion Pictures for The Full Monty * 1998, Won ALFS Award for British Producer of the Year for Palookaville and The Full Monty * 1998, nominated for Academy Award for Best Picture from for The Full Monty * 1998, nomination for Golden Satellite Award for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Comedy or Musical for The Full Monty * 1998, nominated for Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film for The Full Monty * 1998, nominated for Australian Film Institute Award Best Foreign Film Award for The Full Monty * 2008, Won FEDIC Award at Venice Film Festival * 2008, Won Label Europa Cinemas Award for Best European film at Venice Film Festival for Machan * 2008, Won Audience Award at Kerala International Film Festival for Machan * 2008, Nominated for International Jury Award at S√£o Paulo International Film Festival for Machan * 2009, Won Audience Award for Best Film at Transilvania International Film Festival for Machan * 2009, Won Best Feature FIlm at Palm Beach International Film Festival for Machan * 2009, Won Best Screenplay at Durban International Film Festival for Machan * 2009, Won Golden Iris for Best Film at Brussels European Film Festival for Machan * 2009, Won RTBF TV Prize for Best Picture at Brussels European Film Festival for Machan * 2009, Won Award of the Mayor of the City of Trenƒç√≠n at Art Film Festival for Machan * 2010, Won Best Film of the Year at the Sarasaviya Awards for Machan References External links * 1957 births Living people Filmmakers who won the Best Film BAFTA Award Italian film directors Italian film producers Italian screenwriters Italian male screenwriters Writers from Rome ","title":"Uberto Pasolini"},{"id":"31276740","text":"Top Row (foaled in 1931) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who, during three years of racing, set two track records, one of which was a world record, and won the then world's richest horse race.

The basic idea underlying the two-dimensional Yao graph is to surround each of the given points by equally spaced rays, partitioning the plane into sectors with equal angles, and to connect each point to its nearest neighbor in each of these sectors. Associated with a Yao graph is an integer parameter which is the number of rays and sectors described above; larger values of produce closer approximations to the Euclidean distance. The stretch factor is at most 1/(cos theta - sin theta), where theta is the angle of the sectors. The same idea can be extended to point sets in more than two dimensions, but the number of sectors required grows exponentially with the dimension.

James B. Dudley High School in the town of Greensboro, North Carolina, where the Agricultural and Technical University is located, was named after Dudley in recognition of his work for his community. Early life Dudley was born on November 2, 1859. He was born into slavery; his parents were owned by Edward B. Dudley the Governor of North Carolina from 1836 to 1841. As a slave of the former governor, the governor greatly influenced Dudley. One of the governor's ideals was that everyone should be educated. Dudley took these ideas to heart and they affected his approach for the rest of his life. Education Because most of the schools in the area were shut down after the American Civil War due to insufficient funding, Dudley wasn't able to attend school until 1867 when the Freedmen's Bureau funded a missionary school in his area. Dudley was one of the first students to enroll. He later attended public schools when they opened in his area, and learned Latin. After going through the public school system, Dudley attended the Institute for Colored Youth in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. For college Dudley attended Shaw College in Raleigh, North Carolina. Throughout his education he focused on learning to become an educator. In 1880, at age 21, Dudley passed the North Carolina state exam required to obtain a teacher's certificate. Later he attended Harvard summer school and gained an M.A. from Livingstone College and an LL.D. from Wilberforce University. Employment =Peabody Graded School= Dudley went straight out of college to work as a teacher in 1880. His first teaching position was in a first grade classroom in Sampson County. The following year, due to his success, he was elected principal of Peabody Graded School in Wilmington, North Carolina, still aged only 21. The school at this time was described as being one of two \\"very good public schools for African Americans\\" in the area. He spent the next fifteen years teaching in Wilmington. He was also President of the State Teachers' Association For Negroes for six years. =Other Roles= One of his many side jobs involved editing and publishing the Wilmington Chronicle. He worked with the Chronicle for the fifteen years he stayed in Wilmington. He left the job at the Chronicle when he moved to Guilford County, leading to the closure of the publication. He was also register of deeds in Wilmington for a period of time, and organized the Perpetual Building and Loan Association. For twenty years he was the foreign correspondent for the Grand Lodge of Masons. He also represented the Republican Party at several conventions. In 1896 he was selected to attend the Republican National Convention in St. Louis, Missouri. As an influential person in the Republican Party, as well as having connections with the Farmer's Alliance, he helped to pass a bill in 1891 that led to the establishment of The Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Colored Race, which was later renamed North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. In 1912 Dudley, with the help of the director of the Agricultural Division of the college, Professor J.H. Bluford, organized the Farmers' Union and Co-operative Society. This institution sponsored local unions in each county of the state. The aim of the society, which was described as having raised the living standards of African American farms in the area, was \\"to discourage the credit and mortgage system among Negro farmers in North Carolina; to assist them in the buying and selling of products; to control methods of production and distribution of farm products; and to secure uniform prices.\\" The Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Colored Race In 1895, the North Carolina legislature appointed Dudley to the Board of Trustees for the college. Later that year, he was made secretary of the board, a position he served in until 1896 when the President, John O. Crosby, resigned. At the next meeting of the board, Dudley was voted unanimously to become the second president of the college. While president, Dudley focused on modifying the curriculum towards jobs that were currently available. He wanted the men and women who attended his college to be able to get jobs and \\"raise the standard of living among their people.\\" His additions to the curriculum included the teaching of carpentry; woodturning; bricklaying; blacksmithing; animal husbandry; horticulture and floriculture; mattress and broom making; shoemaking; poultry raising; tailoring; electrical engineering; and domestic science. As well as adding these specific classes, Dudley also added an entire teaching department to the school, that taught students how to be a teacher while placing special emphasis on \\"courtesy, manners, and an appreciation to culture in general.\\" He also added a summer school program. =Agricultural and Technical College= In 1915-1916 the college changed its name to \\"Agricultural and Technical College\\", as part of a major overhaul. The change was provoked by the college being in debt due to not having sufficient students enrolled to support it. Many people in the area wanted \\"a professional or classical education. Especially, many parents wished their sons to become preachers, lawyers, teachers, or physicians.\\" The overhaul was Dudley's approach to addressing all of the problems. He also began offering \\"a course of study suited to the ability and needs of students.\\" Another issue had been that many people opposed the co-educational student body. As a result, when the college re-opened, it was as an all-male college. Death Dudley's career ended while he was president at the college. In early April, Dudley left the college due to sudden severe headaches to go home and rest. For several days Dudley was able to attend to his duties from his home, until he unexpectedly died on April 4, 1925 at the age of 65. Dudley was buried in the Pine Forest cemetery on the northern end of 16th street in Wilmington, his home town.

While the characters in the novels always perceive three of the dimensions as space and one as time, this classification depends entirely on their state of motion, and the dimension that one observer considers to be time can be seen as a purely spatial dimension by another observer. The plot involves the inhabitants of a planet that comes under threat from a barrage of high-velocity meteors known as 'hurtlers', who launch a generation ship that exploits the distinctive relativistic effects present in this universe which allow far more time to elapse on the ship than passes on the home world, in order for the ship's inhabitants to have enough time to develop the technology needed to protect the planet. The three novels deal with a succession of increasingly advanced scientific discoveries, as well as a number of radical social changes in the culture of the generation ship's passengers. Technically, the space-time of the universe portrayed in the novels has a positive-definite Riemannian metric, rather than a pseudo-Riemannian metric, which is the kind that describes our own universe. The first novel of the trilogy, The Clockwork Rocket, was published in 2011, the second, The Eternal Flame, in 2012, and the third, The Arrows of Time, in 2013.

Early life Born in Waupun, Wisconsin, Magdalen Redman grew up in the years before Little League Baseball allowed girls to play, and she had to play sandlot ball with the neighborhood kids. She did not start playing organized softball until age 17 in Oconomowoc, about 37 miles away from Waupun, where she was spotted by an AAGPBL scout. \\"They sent a tentative contract and invitation to spring training in the mail. I remember being told that I had made the final cut‚ÄîI don't remember anything further about a contract,\\" Redman said in an interview. She attended the 1948 spring training at Opa-locka, Florida, and was located to the Kenosha Comets, playing for them for two years before joining the Grand Rapids Chicks from 1950 to 1954. AAGPBL career Unspectacular, but quite effective, Redman enjoyed a solid career during her seven years in the league, being noted by her enthusiastic and great knowledge of the game. In her rookie season she played every fielding position except pitcher. After that she played at infield, mainly at third base, before converting to catcher for the rest of her career. She had a stellar defense, being able to catch low balls and block home plate well, which combined with a strong and secure throwing arm. In 1949 Redman posted the best fielding average among catchers with a .978 mark. Then, she repeated her feat in 1953 after leading all-catchers with a .975 average, helping Grand Rapids win the Championship Series. Her most productive season came in 1954, when she posted a .240 batting average with 39 runs and 20 RBI in 75 games, all career numbers.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League A modest .172 career hitter, she collected a notable .349 on-base percentage while batting .267 with three runs and three RBI in six playoff games. As a catcher, she committed only 40 errors in 1,345 chances for a .970 average. Bill Allington All-Stars When the league was unable to continue in 1955, Redman joined several other players selected by former Fort Wayne Daisies manager Bill Allington to play in the national touring team known as the All- Americans All-Stars. The squad played 100 games, each booked in a different town, against male teams, while traveling over 10,000 miles in the manager's station wagon and a Ford Country Sedan. Besides Redman, the Allington All- Stars included players as Joan Berger, Gloria Cordes, Jeanie Descombes, Gertrude Dunn, Betty Foss, Mary Froning, Jean Geissinger, Katie Horstman, Maxine Kline, Dolores Lee, Ruth Richard, Dorothy Schroeder, Jean Smith, Dolly Vanderlip and Joanne Weaver, among others.The Patriotic Pinch Hitter: Bill Allington's All-American TeamWomen in Baseball: The Forgotten History ‚Äì Gai Ingham Berlage, Charley Gerard.

The seven occurrences with a predicate nominative that have resulted in some of the titles for Jesus are: :* I am the Bread of Life (John 6:35) :* I am the Light of the World (John 8:12) :* I am the Door (John 10:9) :* I am the Good Shepherd (John 10:11,14) :* I am the Resurrection and the Life (John 11:25) :* I am the Way and the Truth and the Life (John 14:6) :* I am the Vine (John 15:1,5) =Without predicate nominative= It is also used without a predicate nominative, which is not very common in Koine Greek, thus it is interpreted it as the reader's own self-declaration as Jesus, declaring Himself God. In John 8:24 Jesus states: \\"For unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins\\", and later the crowd attempts to stone Jesus in response to his statement in John 8:58: \\"Before Abraham was, I am.\\". Many other translations including the ASV have rendered John 8:24 as something like \\"... For unless you believe that I am [he], you will die in your sins.\\". Some consider the phrase in John 8:58 to be grammatically different from that in John 8:24, as the copulative verb can be used with any predicative expression and not only a predicate nominative, such as in \\"·ΩÖœÄŒøœÖ Œµ·º∞Œº·Ω∂ ·ºêŒ≥·Ωº Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ΩëŒºŒµ·øñœÇ ·º¶œÑŒµ\\" (\\"where I am, you also may be\\") in John 14:3. \\"œÄœÅ·Ω∂ŒΩ ·ºàŒ≤œÅŒ±·Ω∞Œº Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒ≠œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ\\" (\\"before Abraham was\\") can be taken as a predicative prepositional phrase, thus \\"·ºêŒ≥œé Œµ·º∞Œº·Ω∂\\" (\\"I am\\") in John 8:58 does not grammatically require a predicate nominative, however it is rather unusual for a present tense verb to be used with a temporal adverb like œÄœÅ·Ω∂ŒΩ in a declarative statement, though there are rare exceptions outside the New Testament. Thus explanations of John 8:58 generally depend on theology and not Greek grammar. =With predicate nominative= There are other times the phrase is used in the New Testament, but with a predicate nominative and/or adjectives in between ·ºêŒ≥œé and Œµ·º∞ŒºŒπ : a centurion in Matt 8:9 and Luke 7:8, Zechariah in Luke 1:18, Gabriel in Luke 1:19, the woman at the well in John 4:26, a man blind from birth in John 9:9 who is healed by Jesus and told to go wash in the Pool of Siloam, Peter in Acts 10:21 and Acts 10:26, Paul the Apostle in Acts 22:3, Acts 23:6, Acts 26:29, Rom 7:14, Rom 11:1, Rom 11:13, 1 Cor 15:9 and 1 Tim 1:15, some Corinthian believer in 1 Cor 1:12 and 1 Cor 3:4, John the Baptist in the negative (Œø·ΩêŒ∫ Œµ·º∞Œº·Ω∂ ·ºêŒ≥·Ωº / I am not) in John 3:28 and Acts 13:25 (compare with Jesus in John 8:23, 17:14,16), and Pilate in a question (ŒúŒÆœÑŒπ ·ºêŒ≥·Ωº ·º∏ŒøœÖŒ¥Œ±·øñœåœÇ Œµ·º∞ŒºŒπ; / Am I [a] Jew?) in John 18:35.Nestle-Aland \\"Novum Testamentum Graece\\", 27th revised edition (a.k.a. \\"NA27\\"), Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, July 2006, \\"The Greek New Testament\\", 4th Edition with Dictionary, United Bible Societies (a.k.a. \\"UBS4\\") Old Testament ·ºêŒ≥œé Œµ·º∞ŒºŒπ also occurs without an explicit or implicit predicate nominative in the Septuagint, but instead either with a prepositional phrase such as in \\"Œº·Ω¥ ·ºÄŒΩœÑ·Ω∂ Œ∏ŒµŒø·ø¶ ·ºêŒ≥œé Œµ·º∞ŒºŒπ ...\\" (\\"Am I in place of God ...\\") Gen 30:2, or with a predicative clause such as in \\"œÄŒ¨œÅŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÄŒ±œÅŒµœÄŒØŒ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøœÇ ·ºêŒ≥œé Œµ·º∞ŒºŒπ ŒºŒµŒ∏' ·ΩëŒº·ø∂ŒΩ\\" (\\"As a foreigner and a sojourner I am with you\\") in Gen 23:4, or with the idiomatic meaning It is I such as in \\"Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œµ·º∂œÄŒµŒΩ ·º∏œâŒ±Œ≤ ·ºÄŒ∫Œøœçœâ ·ºêŒ≥œé Œµ·º∞ŒºŒπ\\" (\\"And Joab said: I hear; it is I.\\") in 2 Sam 20:17. The unique expression of the Tetragrammaton ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î (yhwh) is composed of matris lectionis (supporting first- class vowels) that suggest a verbal cognate noun derived from ◊î◊ô◊î (hayah), the Hebrew copulative otherwise known as the verb \\"to be\\". Translations often render this word in compliance with the tradition of the Septuagint, \\"Lord\\". Later it has been pointed with the vowels of the word Elohim and transcribed as \\"Jehovah\\". Finally the Tetragrammaton was vocalized as Yahweh. But often found in apposition, if not in construct state (there is no way of telling) with elohim, it suggests \\"the being\\" or the \\"I AM\\" of God.

It is planned to be the southern terminus of the Fall River branch of the South Coast Rail project, and will open in 2030 as part of the project's Phase II. The station will have no parking - it is intended for tourists visiting Battleship Cove and the Fall River waterfront, with Fall River station to the north serving commuters - and will be open seasonally. Previous passenger service to Fall River included stations at Fall River Wharf (1847-1937) and Ferry Street (1864-1958). The Wharf station was the terminus of the Fall River Line steamship service. History =Previous stations= The Boat Train at Fall River Wharf station around 1900 The Fall River Railroad opened from Myricks to Fall River in June 1845, and to the Old Colony Railroad at South Braintree in December 1846. In 1847, the Fall River and Old Colony began running the Boston‚ÄìFall River Boat Train, which met Fall River Line steamers from New York at the Fall River Wharf. Wharf station also served the surrounding industrial area. The two railroads merged in 1854; after several name changes, it again became the Old Colony Railroad in 1872. The Old Colony subsidiary Old Colony and Newport Railroad opened between Fall River and Newport in 1864, with an additional station at Ferry Street in Fall River. Newport was the terminal of the steamers until 1869, when they returned to Fall River. In 1872, the Fall River Line became part of the Old Colony system; in 1893, the Old Colony in turn became part of the New Haven Railroad. Steamship service between Fall River and New York ended in 1937, and passenger service between Fall River and Newport ended the next year. Passenger service to Boston, with Ferry Street as the terminal, continued (except for 1949-1952) until September 5, 1958. The line continued to be used for freight service by the New Haven and its successors Penn Central and Conrail, then finally as the CSX Fall River Subdivision. After the state purchased the line in 2010, freight service (which runs only as far south as Ferry Street) was transferred to the Massachusetts Coastal Railroad =New station= In September 2008, MassDOT released 18 potential station sites for the South Coast Rail project, including two sites in Fall River. Fall River station would be a full-time station serving commuters, while Battleship Cove station would be a seasonal station for tourists visiting Battleship Cove and the Fall River waterfront. A 2009 conceptual design called for a single side platform serving one track, with access at the center of the platform from City Gates Plaza. Plans released as part of the Final Environmental Impact Report in 2013 moved the platform about to the south, and added a second track for freight trains to pass the station. In 2017, the project was re-evaluated due to cost issues. A new proposal released in March 2017 called for early service via Middleborough by 2024, followed by full service via Stoughton by 2029. Battleship Cove would have only been built during the second phase. By mid-2017, plans called for the first phase to be completed in 2022, and to include stations at Freetown and Battleship Cove in Phase 1 rather than Phase 2. However, the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report released in January 2018 pushed Battleship Cove back to Phase II.

It is planned to open in 2023 as part of the first phase of the South Coast Rail project. The station will have a single -long side platform on the east side of the single track of the New Bedford Subdivision. History A postcard of Acushnet station The New Bedford and Taunton Railroad opened between its mainsake cities in July 1840, completing a rail route between Boston and New Bedford. Acushnet station, located at Tarkin Hill Road north of downtown New Bedford, served the eponymous town to the east. Service was later consolidated under the New Bedford Railroad (1873), Boston, Clinton, Fitchburg and New Bedford Railroad (1876), Old Colony Railroad (1879), and finally the New Haven Railroad (1893). Passenger service on the line continued until September 5, 1958. However, local stops including Acushnet were discontinued well before then, and trains ran nonstop from New Bedford to Taunton. The line continued to be used for freight service by the New Haven and its successors Penn Central and Conrail, then finally as the CSX New Bedford Subdivision. In September 2008, MassDOT released 18 potential station sites, including a King's Highway station in New Bedford (at the former Acushnet station site). By 2013, plans called for the station to be on the west side of the tracks slightly south of King's Highway, sharing parking with an existing strip mall. In 2017, the project was re-evaluated due to cost issues. The new proposal called for King's Highway station to be part of the first phase. In 2019, the planned site was moved across the tracks due to drainage and land acquisition issues, with the name changed to North New Bedford for clarity. A footbridge may be constructed to provide access from the west side of the tracks. In 2020, the planned name was changed to Church Street. A former industrial building at 387 Church Street was demolished in 2020 to make room for the station and its parking lot. The MBTA awarded a $403.5 million contract for the Middleborough Secondary and New Bedford Secondary portions of the project, including Church Street station, on August 24, 2020; construction was expected to begin later in 2020 and take 37 months.

In 1928 Hurricane San Felipe hit Puerto Rico and destroyed many of the base wooden structures. The Navy left Cayey as a result of the damage from Hurricane San Felipe and moved to Naval Air Station Isla Grande in San Juan. All the land held by the Navy to include Magazine Hill (El Polvorin) were absorbed by the U. S. Army. In 1929 new permanent buildings were constructed at the Henry Barracks. After the Korean War the U.S. Army brought in troops not native to Puerto Rico. They were called \\"Continentals\\" by the locals from Cayey Puerto Rico. By that time the combat troops stationed at Henry Barracks consisted of an artillery battalion and a heavy mortar company. Base Closing In 1953, the U.S. Army reached the conclusion that Henry Barracks would be closed in the near future. A full complement of the Army phased out its presence at the post in 1965 when the base was transferred to the General Services Administration for decommission. Burials ceased at the Henry Barracks military cemetery in 1965 and the graves were moved to the Puerto Rico National Cemetery. Most of the land and buildings were transferred to the University of Puerto Rico and opened the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey campus in 1967 while other facilities were transferred to the municipality of Cayey, Puerto Rico. Most of the land and buildings that was transferred to the municipality of Cayey were turned into sports facilities. National Guard The Military keep one parcel from the Henry Barracks army base for the Puerto Rico National Guard 1st Battalion, 65th Infantry Regiment Headquarters and Headquarters Company, and the 105th Forward Support Company. A heliport, maintenance shop, administration offices and a NGX PX are some of the facilities at the National Guard post use mostly for monthly drills. Army ROTC The University of Puerto Rico at Cayey hosted the U.S. Army Reserve Officers Training Course ROTC program at a site in the former Herry Barracks base. The Army ROTC had an office, several classrooms, an obstacle course and a rappeling tower. After many years in operations the Army ROTC left the UPR Cayey campus in 1997.

Although still shown on some Ordnance Survey mapping, Westmoreland is rarely used by residents as the name of an area of Bath, and is primarily used for electoral purposes within the Bath and North East Somerset unitary authority, electing two councillors.Bath and North East Somerset Councillors The name Westmoreland is probably derived from the house, Westmoreland Place (see 1818 and 1852 maps of Bath), that stood approximately where Westmoreland Street is today. Boundary changes for the electoral wards in Bath most recently took place at the May 2019 elections;Bath and North East Somerset 2018 ward review Westmoreland remained a ward but with altered boundaries. At that election, Westmoreland elected two independents, and was the only ward in the city not to return Liberal Democrats. Confusingly Westmoreland Street, Westmoreland Drive and Westmoreland Road, as well as the former Westmoreland goods station which closed in 1967, are not in the present-day ward, but about half a kilometre away in Oldfield Park ward.Ordnance Survey Election maps Conversely, Oldfield Park railway station and a part of the Oldfield Park residential area, including Moorland Road which is a shopping district, is located in Westmoreland ward. Also in the ward is East Twerton and the one end of the Two Tunnels Greenway. The wards surrounding Westmoreland ward are: Oldfield Park to the east, Moorlands and Southdown to the south, Twerton to the west, and Newbridge and Kingsmead to the north over the River Avon, which forms the ward's northern boundary. Westmoreland has a considerable student population, from the University of Bath and Bath Spa University, both in private rental, and for Bath Spa University students accommodation blocks on former industrial land by the River Avon.
