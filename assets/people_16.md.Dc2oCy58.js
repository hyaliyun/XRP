Backgrounding occurs at backgrounding operations and fattening occurs at a feedlot. Feeder calves are less than 1 year old; feeder yearlings are between 1 and 2 years old. Both types are often produced in a cow-calf operation. After attaining a desirable weight, feeder cattle become live cattle (also called \\"finished cattle\\", \\"fat cattle\\", or \\"fed cattle\\"), that are sold to a packer. Packers slaughter the cattle and sell the meat in carcass boxed form. Feedlots producing live cattle for slaughter will typically purchase 500-850 pound feeder cattle calves and feed to grow the animals into 850-1400 pound cattle. Backgrounding operations will typically purchase 300-600 pound feeder cattle calves and feed to grow the animals into 650-875 pound backgrounded cattle. Backgrounding cattle that achieve weights of 650-700 pounds are suitable for sale to grass feeding operations, whereas those achieving weights of 800-825 pounds are suitable for sale to feedlot operators. Buyers of feeder cattle tend to look for high average gain (in weight) and low feed-to-gain ratio. Depending on circumstances, different feeder cattle buyers will look for different ranges of animal weight and grade. Cattle producers and backgrounding operations balance feeder cattle prices, weights, time taken to fatten, death rates, and other feeder cattle factors against feed prices, live cattle prices, and other operating factors to profit from their operations. United States feeder cattle grades The United States grades feeder cattle that have not reached an age of 36 months on three factors: frame size, thickness, and thriftiness. Frame size evaluates feeder cattle' height and body length as determined by their skeletal size in relation with their age; frame size affects the animals' mature size and weight gain composition as they are fed into fed cattle. A large framed feeder cattle of a given age, breed, and a given degree of thickness will gain more muscle and bone, and less fat, than a smaller framed animal with the same age, breed, and thickness at a given maturity age. In terms of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) grades for cattle carcasses, at a given weight and thickness, large framed cattle (fed from large framed feeder cattle) will have carcasses with higher yield grades, but lower quality grades. If feeder cattle are fed to the same quality grade, Choice (0.50 inch fat at the twelfth rib) for example, large framed cattle of a given thickness have to be fed to heavier weights than smaller framed cattle of the same thickness. Age and breed modifies the precise sizes that segment this grade. Large frame feeder cattle are tall and long-bodied for their age and breed, and steers and heifers of this frame, everything else being constant, are not expected to produce US Choice until they are fed to 1250 pounds and 1150 pounds, respectively. Medium frame feeder cattle are slightly tall and slightly long-bodied for their age and breed, and steers and heifers of this frame, everything else being constant, are not expected to produce US Choice until they are fed to 1100 to 1250 pounds and 1000 to 1150 pounds, respectively. Small frame feeder cattle are shorter and not as tall for their age and breed compared to medium frame feeder cattle, and steers and heifers of this frame, everything else being constant, are not expected to produce US Choice until they are fed to 1100 pounds and 1000 pounds, respectively. Thickness evaluates feeder cattle' muscle development in relation to skeletal size. Bone structure, muscling, and degree of fatness determines differences in thickness. Thicker cattle have higher ratios of muscle to bone. Thickness affects the animals' yield grade as they are fed into fed cattle, and a thick feeder cattle of a given age, breed, and frame size will produce a higher yield grade carcass, than a less thick animal of the same age, breed, and frame size at a given maturity age. If feeder cattle are fed to the same quality grade, Choice for example, thicker feeder cattle of a given thickness have to be fed to heavier weights than less thick feeder cattle of the same thickness. Age and breed modifies the precise sizes that segment this grade. Thickness are graded No. 1 to No. 4 No. 1 thickness cattle must be at least moderately thick throughout their bodies, full in the forearm and the gaskin, and showing a rounded appearance through the back and the loin with moderate width between their legs. No. 2. thickness cattle must be at least slightly thick throughout their bodies, full in the forearm and the gaskin, and showing a rounded appearance through the back and the loin with a slight width between their legs. No. 3 thickness cattle must be at least thin through the forequarter and middle part of the rounds, their forearm and gaskin are thin and their backs and loins have a sunken appearance, and their both front and rear legs are set close together. No. 4 thickness cattle include any cattle with even less thickness than the minimum requirements for No. 3 cattle. No. 1 thickness cattle typically show mostly beef breeding, No. 2 thickness cattle typically show high proportions of beef breeding and slight diary breeding, and so on with lower thickness cattle. Thriftiness evaluates feeder cattle' overall health and expected performance in gaining weight to become a fed cattle. There are no strict guidelines as to grading thrift cattle, rather cattle with apparent health problems are graded as unthrifty and other cattle are categorized as thrifty. The above three factors and their segmented categories combine to form individual grades. For examples, for thrifty cattle, the frame and thickness factors combine to form 12 different grades of thrifty cattle: No. 1; Large Frame, No.2; Large Frame, No. 3; Large Frame, No. 4; Medium Frame, No. 1; Medium Frame, No. 2; Medium Frame, No. 3; Medium Frame, No. 4; Small Frame, No. 1; Small Frame, No. 2; Small Frame, No. 3; and finally Small Frame, No. 4. Cash market factors Price to pay for feeder steers in order to receive average returns for labor, overhead and profit with assumed prices for fat cattle and feed, with typical feeding programs; U.S. Department of Agriculture Health status, and visual indicators of health, can give feeder cattle premiums or discounts when sold in auctions. Feeder cattle with dead hair and mud are often sold at a discount, and those that are classified as \\"stale\\" are sold at a discount. Feeder cattle with other obvious physical indicators that would imply sickness are heavily discounted. The primary sickness encountered in feeder cattle is respiratory sickness. Discounts on sick feeder cattle compensate for the their increased risk of death, and lower performance in weight gain even if they recover. Cattle that looked visually \\"thin\\" or \\"fleshy\\" are generally given discounts or premiums distinct from sickness discounts, as these visual traits do not necessarily indicate sickness and could be advantageous in particular feeding scenarios. Some feeder cattle are sold with some pre-existing health maintenance programs. These programs may include weaning 21 to 45 days before sale, vaccinating for respiratory and digestive diseases, de-horning, castrating, implanting growth implants, treating for external and internal parasites, and starting to switch the feeder cattle to grain-based feed. Lot size, or the number of feeder cattle for sale in a group, in relation to transportation available, weight, and sale location impact feeder cattle prices heavily. Price per weight increase with lot size and reach a maximum when lot sizes approaches truck-load sizes. As lot sizes exceed truck-load sizes, prices level off and eventually decrease. This represents fewer buyers and available transportation for larger lots of feeder cattle. Futures market trading Feeder cattle Futures contracts, traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), can be used to hedge and to speculate on the price of feeder cattle. Cattle producers can hedge future buying and selling prices for feeder cattle through trading feeder cattle futures, and such trading is a common part of a producer's risk management program. Production and marketing contracts for delivering feeder cattle in cash markets could also include feeder cattle futures prices as part of a reference price formula. The contracts are for 50,000 pounds of feeder cattle, and call for cash settlement based on the CME Feeder Cattle Index. The minimum tick size for the contract is $0.00025 per pound ($12.50 per contract). Trading on the contract are subject to price limits of $0.045 per pound above or below the previous day's contract settlement price. If both of the first two listed contract months settle at limit, the daily price limits for all contract months shall expand to $0.0675 per pound on the next business day. If neither of the first two listed futures contract months settle at the expanded limit the next business day, daily price limits for all contract months shall revert to $0.045 per pound on the following business day. =Final settlement based on CME Feeder Cattle Index= Feeder cattle futures contracts are cash settled based on the CME Feeder Cattle Index. The Index inputs are seven-day feeder cattle auction, direct trade, video sale, and Internet sale transaction prices for qualified steers publicly reported from the following twelve feeder cattle producing states: Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming. Qualified steers must be between 700 and 899 pounds, and be in either the Medium and Large Frame #1 or Medium and Large Frame #1-2 feeder cattle grades. Additionally, qualifying steers must not exhibit predominantly dairy, exotic, or Brahman breed characteristics, and must not have an origin outside of the US. The CME Feeder Cattle Index is calculated using prices reported by USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). AMS reports number of cattle sold, average price of sale, and average weight of cattle sold for daily feeder cattle transactions for every US state in 50 pound segments for each grade segment. For example, separate average prices and average weight data are reported for the Medium and Large Frame #1 700-749 pound category, and for the Medium and Large Frame #1 750-799 pound category. The CME Feeder Cattle has eight qualifying reporting segment derived from its qualifying weight and grade standards: Medium & Large #1 steers weighting 700-749 pounds, Medium & Large #1 steers weighting 750-799 pounds, Medium & Large #1 steers weighting 800-849 pounds, Medium & Large #1 steers weighting 849-899 pounds, Medium & Large #1-#2 steers weighting 700-749 pounds, Medium & Large #1-#2 steers weighting 750-799 pounds, Medium & Large #1-#2 steers weighting 800-849 pounds, and Medium & Large #1-#2 steers weighting 849-899 pounds. The CME Feeder Cattle Index is calculated through the following steps: # The number of cattle sold is multiplied by the average weight of feeder cattle sold within each qualifying 50 pound grade category to produce \\"Total Pounds Sold\\" for that category # The number of cattle sold is multiplied by the average weight and the average price of feeder cattle sold to produce the \\"Total Dollars Sold\\" for that category # \\"Total Pounds Sold\\" are added together from the eight qualifying reporting categories of each report, and then reports from all 12 states for the last seven days are added together to produce an aggregated figure # \\"Total Dollars Sold\\" are added together from the eight qualifying reporting categories of each report, and then reports from all 12 states for the last seven days are added together to produce an aggregated figure # The aggregated \\"Total Dollars Sold\\" is divided by the \\"Total Pounds Sold\\" to produce an average dollar paid per pound price, which then becomes the CME Feeder Cattle Index figure Qualifying Cattle sold with certain minor notes are also included in the CME Feeder Cattle Index. =Related derivatives= Derivatives on futures and derivatives on packages of futures contracts, such as options, calendar spread contracts, Trade-at-Settlement (TAS) contracts are also available for feeder cattle futures contracts. Feeder cattle futures prices are a part of the S&P; GSCI commodity index, which is a benchmark index widely followed in financial markets by traders and institutional investors. Its weighting in S&P; GSCI give feeder cattle futures prices non-trivial influence on returns on a wide range of investment funds and portfolios. Conversely, traders and investors have become non-trivial participants in the market for feeder cattle futures. The CME offers a S&P; GSCI Commodity Index futures contract for trading. Feeder cattle futures contracts are often grouped together with live cattle and lean hogs futures contracts as livestock futures contracts. These commodities share many fundamental demand and supply risks, such long feeding periods, weather, feed prices, and consumer sentiment, which makes grouping them together useful for commercial discussions about both the commodities and their futures contracts. Commodity indices have followed this practice and grouped these futures contracts together in livestock futures contracts categories. Gross Margin Financial Instruments Cattle producers purchase feeder cattle to feed into live cattle or fed cattle for sale to slaughterhouses. Depending on the operation, producers purchase corn, soybean meal, and other commodities as feed. The difference between the selling price for live cattle and the costs of purchasing feeder cattle and feed (usually assumed to be corn, regardless of actual mix of feed used) is referred to as livestock gross margin (LGM), feeding margin, or cattle crush (as opposed to production margin, which also includes other production costs). Cattle producers can use existing futures contracts for feeder cattle and corn to fix those production cost components into the future. Traders can purchase those futures and the live cattle futures contract in particular ratios to profit from the difference of selling finished live cattle against the cost of buying the feeder cattle and feeding the cattle. In addition to exchange- traded products, cattle producers can purchase livestock gross margin insurance policy contracts (LGM-Cattle) sponsored by the USDA Risk Management Agency from authorized crop insurance agents. These insurance policy contracts are bundles of exchange-traded options on futures contracts, and prices for these policy contracts refer to exchange-traded futures prices.

S. market hogs were purchased on a carcass merit system that differentiated price based on lean content. The differentials varied, and there was a scarcity of data to indicate whether the price spread was sufficient between good and poor quality pigs. A checkoff- funded task force in 1990 recommended that procedures be established to determine value of pigs based on pounds of quality lean in the carcass. In 1993, the National Pork Producers Council's (NPPC) Lean Value Task Force, funded by the National Pork Board (NPB) and in cooperation with the Pork Committee of the American Meat Institute, developed the Uniform Lean Information Project. In it, the Fat-Free Lean Index, (FFLI) was developed. The intent of the FFLI was to permit pork producers to compare the lean content of their pigs over time and with the pigs of other producers, even though each producer may be marketing to different processors using different technology to estimate carcass lean content. The original FFLI equations were based on carcass separation data collected in university trials from 1970 to 1985 from pigs weighing between 200 and 250 lb.

The school's auditorium and its driveway are named for Anthony Prochilo, who served as principal from 1960 to 1984. As of 2014, the current student body size (9th - 12th grade) is close to 400 students. In the past, the school served a larger student population, including students from a number of other communities that did not have their own high schools. In 1933, for example, the school was also accepting students from Port Jefferson Station, Terryville, Belle Terre, Miller Place, Mount Sinai, Rocky Point, Wading River, Shoreham, Middle Island, West Middle Island, West Yaphank, Ridge, Coram, Selden, and Stony Brook.(reporting that 10 districts considering a merger, Coram, West Middle Island, East Middle Island, Ridge Yaphank, Shoreham, Miller Place, Rocky Point, Sound Beach, and Wading River were currently sending all secondary students to Port Jefferson High School) As surrounding communities began to open their own high schools with the spread of suburban growth into Suffolk County, this practice subsided, and finally ended with the opening of Mount Sinai High School in 1991. The last graduating class outside Port Jefferson from Mount Sinai graduated in June 1992.

Found in tropical Mexico, it was described as new to science by Mexican mycologist Laura Guzm√°n-D√°valos in 2006. The flesh of this mushroom is blue where bruised. Systematics The species was first described by mycologist Laura Guzm√°n-D√°valos in 2006 based on a type collection found on the roots of dead palm in the main city square of Puerto de Veracruz, Veracruz, Mexico. The epithet cyanopalmicola refers to the blue staining fruit bodies and the microscopic similarity to Gymnopilus palmicola. Description The fruit bodies of Gymnopilus cyanopalmicola have yellow, convex to plane caps in diameter, with fibrillose scales that are erect near the center and appressed near the margin. The gills are crowded, ventricose, with adnate to decurrent gill attachment. The stem is long by thick, cylindrical, fibrillose, tapering at the base in larger fruit bodies. It is colored yellowish white, and turns purple, dark reddish or dark brown when bruised or dried. The stipe has a conspicuous but soon fading membranous yellowish-white annulus. The pileus trama is light yellow, similar to the color of the cap. The odor is fungal. The verrucose spores are ellipsoid to oblong, amygdaliform, thick walled, and lack a germ pore and plague, but have a superhilar depression. They typically measure 8.0 - 8.8 (-11.2) x by 5‚Äì6 (6 - 8) Œºm. They are dextrinoid, orange-brown in KOH, not metachromatic, and have cyanophilic ornamentation. Basidia are clear to yellowish, four spored, 26.4 - 37.5 x 6.4 - 7.7 Œºm, cylindrical to clavate, constricted in the middle, with sterigmata 3.2‚Äì4.8 Œºm long. The bases of the basidia have clamp connections. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are clear to yellowish, sometimes with granulose yellow brown contents, narrowly lageniform with a subcapitate to capitate apex, and have dimensions of 21.6‚Äì28 √ó 6.4‚Äì7.6 Œºm, with an apex of 4.8‚Äì7.2 Œºm. The base of the cheilocystidia have clamp connections. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are extremely rare. When present they are clear to yellowish, utriform, 21.6‚Äì26 √ó 7 Œºm, with an obtuse to subcapitate apex that has a diameter of 3.4‚Äì5.6 Œºm. The hymenophoral trama is subparallel, clear to yellowish, with hyphae 3.4 - 14.7 Œºm in diameter and many refractive drops. The subhymenium is cellular and clear, with some elongated inflated elements. The pileus trama is yellowish to brownish, radial, with interwoven zones near the pileipellis, and has hyphae 4.8 - 8.7 Œºm in diameter, with .5 to 2.5 Œºm walls. The cap cuticle is a cutis with prostrate hyphae. The scales are a trichoderm with septate hyphae 7.2 to 23.5 Œºm in diameter, with clamp connections and yellowish brown pigment encrusted in bands. Pileocystidia are absent. Caulocystidia are narrowly lageniform to narrowly utriform, 31 - 44 x 5.6 - 11 Œºm, with a 3 - 7 Œºm capitate to subcapitate apex.

The church features simple Gothic Revival design and a New England-style clapboard white exterior along with nicked wooden benches and wide-plank redwood floors. The wood for the chapel came from the hills around Oakland; the trees were brought over by oxen to be milled in Dublin. It was constructed by the Murray and Fallon families, Irish immigrants from Elphin, County Roscommon who left before the Great Famine and had lived in New York City before joining some of the early wagon trains to the west, including the Donner Party.Bennett, Virginia Smith (1991). Dublin Reflections and Bits of Valley History, p. 24, 50. Dublin Historical Preservation Association, Dublin, CA. But both families parted with the Donner Party at Fort Bridger in Wyoming.

Originally a mission church, the local residents were unable to afford a full-time priest so a member of the Oakland clergy would ride to St. Raymond's once a month by mule to offer Mass. Later the church came under St. Leander's Church in San Leandro, then St. Michael's in Livermore and finally, in 1961 it came within the jurisdiction of St. Augustine's in Pleasanton.Bennett, Virginia Smith (1991).

Dublin Historical Preservation Association, Dublin, CA. The belfry was first added in 1880. In 1966, the church moved to a new, much larger location (also named St. Raymond's Church) and the Oakland Diocese gave the old church to Amador-Livermore Valley Historical Society (ALVHS) to be preserved and restored. ALVHS put the building to many uses, then sold the church to the City of Dublin in 1993. The city was also able to acquire the adjacent Old Murray Schoolhouse and the Dublin Pioneer Cemetery to set up an area deemed the Dublin Heritage Center. The City of Dublin rents the building out for community and private use. The first recorded renovation of Old St. Raymond's Church was 1922, and the most recent soon after the city took possession of the structure. The church's general appearance has remained unchanged since its construction in 1859. Through private donations, a new bell tower was constructed; in 1967 the church's restoration was complete.Bennett, Virginia Smith (1991). Dublin Reflections and Bits of Valley History, p. 15.

Function  Calmodulin (CaM) is recognized as a major calcium (Ca2+) sensor and orchestrator of regulatory events through its interaction with a diverse group of cellular proteins. Three classes of recognition motifs exist for many of the known CaM binding proteins; the IQ motif as a consensus for Ca2+-independent binding and two related motifs for Ca2+-dependent binding, termed 1-14 and 1-5-10 based on the position of conserved hydrophobic residues.

Bolibrukh was the author of about a hundred research articles on theory of ordinary differential equations including Riemann‚ÄìHilbert problem and Fuchsian system.IRMA Lectures dedicated to the memory of Andrei Bolibrukh Work Bolibrukh was born on 30 January 1950 in Moscow and studied at the 45th Physics-Mathematics School in Saint Petersburg. After receiving his mathematical education at the Lomonosov Moscow State University, with Mikhail Mikhailovich Postnikov and Alexey Chernavskii as thesis advisers, he started working on the proof of the existence of linear differential equations having a prescribed monodromic group. He applied modern methods of complex analytic geometry to classical problems about ordinary differential equations and was an expert on Hilbert's twenty-first problem. In 1989, Bolibrukh produced his famous counterexamples which invalidated the Josip Plemelj's 1908 solution of Hilbert's twenty-first problem. Bolibrukh dedicated much of his efforts to the Riemann-Hilbert problem in order to find full necessary and sufficient conditions for given monodromy data to be those of a Fuchsian system. During his short career he served as Deputy Director of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics and professor at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.Chair of Mathematics, MIPT Honours and awards In 1994 Bolibrukh was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences.

He served as Bishop of Alton from 1870 until his death in 1886. Biography Peter Baltes was born in Ensheim, Rhenish Palatinate, Diocese of Speyer (in that time political a part of Bavaria, today divided up between the new German federal-states Rhineland- Palatinate and Saarland). Ensheim is now a township of the Saarland capital Saarbr√ºcken. Peter was the fourth child of the carpenter and tin-smith Andreas Baltes and his wife Susanna n√©e Walljan. In 1833 the family emigrated to the United States, where they settled in Oswego, New York. After attending the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, he studied at St. Mary of the Lake Seminary in Chicago, Illinois and at the Grand Seminary of Montreal in Qu√©bec, Canada, where he was ordained to the priesthood on May 21, 1853. Upon his return to the Diocese of Chicago, Baltes was assigned to Waterloo, Monroe County. He was later transferred to Belleville, St. Clair County, in 1855. While in Belleville, he placed both the local parochial school and the Young Ladies' Academy of the Immaculate Conception under the care of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, and built St. Peter's Church (which later became the cathedral of the Diocese of Belleville). In 1866 he was named vicar general of the diocese and attended the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore as Bishop Henry Damian Juncker's theologian. Following the death of Bishop Juncker in October 1868, Baltes became apostolic administrator of the diocese; during his administration, he obtained from the Illinois General Assembly the passage of a law under which the Catholic congregations and institutions could be incorporated. On September 24, 1869, Baltes was named the second Bishop of Alton by Pope Pius IX. He received his episcopal consecration on January 23, 1870 from Bishop John Henry Luers, assisted by Bishops Augustus Toebbe and Patrick John Ryan, at St. Peter's in Belleville. He held annual spiritual retreats with his clergy, introduced the Gregorian chant and Cecilian music into the diocesan liturgical practices, and condemned Catholic newspapers that challenged his authority. By the end of his tenure, the diocese included 109,000 Catholics, 177 priests, 126 parishes and 77 missions, 13 hospitals, three orphanages, two homes for the elderly, two men's colleges, a boys' high school, nine girls' academies, and 102 parochial schools with 11,000 students. In 1878 Baltes visited his home-village and celebrated also a mass in the Speyer Cathedral of his German home- diocese.Jakob Bisson, \\"Sieben Speyerer Bisch√∂fe und ihre Zeit\\", Pilger Publishers, Speyer, 1956. page 191, 192. Long suffering from diseases of the kidneys, bladder, and liver, Baltes was unable to attend the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1884 due to ill health. After spending a few months in hospitals at New York and Montreal, he returned to Illinois and, after suffering from an inflammation of the liver, later died at age 58.

There are many different types of farm programs, with a variety of objectives and created with different economic mechanisms in mind. Some are meant to benefit farmers directly, while others seek to benefit consumers. They target food prices and quantity of food available on the market, as well as production and consumption of certain goods. Some are meant to benefit farmers directly, while others seek to benefit consumers. They target food prices and quantity of food available on the market, as well as production and consumption of certain goods.  Farm Programs in the United States of America  In United States agricultural policy, the term farm programs is generally meant to include the commodity programs administered by the Farm Service Agency, as well as the other USDA programs that directly benefit farmers. Some examples of the other programs include farm loans, federal crop insurance, the Noninsured Assistance Program (NAP), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), and conservation cost sharing, and the \\"food stamps\\" program of SNAP, which is included in each farm spending bill because it acts as a subsidy, keeping crop prices higher by increasing financial demand for food by about eighty billion dollars per year (in 2014). Farm programs in the United States may seem obscure or confusing because rather than being a unit that was planned together, these programs have been developed through trial and error. Programs have been added or adjusted since the 1930s as problems have been identified with previous versions Glauber, Joseph W.; Sumner, Daniel A.; and Wilde, Parke E. 2017. Poverty, hunger, and US agricultural policy: Do farm programs affect the nutrition of poor Americans? Washington, D.C.: American Enterprise Institute (AEI). https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Effects-of-Farm-Policy-on-Food- Consumption.pdf. In the book ‚ÄúFood Policy in the United States‚Äù (2018), food economist Dr. Parke Wilde offers helpful advice for understanding the tangle that farm programs may seem to be. He suggests identifying whom a policy helps, hurts, and what changes it has on the quantities produced and consumed of the farm products it targets. The book discusses the seven broad categories of farm programs that are summarized below: price supports, supply control, deficiency payments, direct payments, countercyclical payments, insurance, and demand expansion . Price supports: keep the price of a product higher than it would be on the market without government intervention. They must include some kind of enforcement mechanism that keeps prices from lowering to the market level. One form of enforcement is purchase and removal, where the government offers to buy any quantity that farmers want to sell at a specified support price. Another is a nonrecourse loan, where the government offers farmers a loan at a specified loan rate and the farmers then choose between paying the loan back or forfeiting their harvest to the government as full repayment. (a) Helps: domestic farmers (b) Hurts: consumers with a low food budget (c) Effect on product price: raises the prices for farmers and consumers (d) Effect on product quantities: increase Supply control: reduces the quantity planted or sold of a crop, which is intended to lower the supply of the good that is available on the market and raise the price of the good above the market equilibrium. This policy also requires some form of enforcement mechanism, which could be a production quota for domestic farmers or restrictions on international trade. (a) Helps: domestic farmers (b) Hurts: consumers with a low food budget, farmers in other countries (c) Effect on product price: raises the prices for farmers and lowers prices for consumers (d) Effect on product quantities: decrease Deficiency payments: a policy where the government pays the difference between a target price they determine and the price that the buyer is supposed to pay. It only occurs on years when the market price is lower than the target price. (a) Helps: domestic farmers, consumers (b) Hurts: farmers in other countries (c) Effect on product price: raises the prices for farmers and consumers (d) Effect on product quantities: increase Direct payments: decoupled subsidies made directly to farmers, which are payments that do not depend on the current production decisions of a farmer. Instead, they are based on the historical production of the farmer during several recent years but not the current one. In the United States, these kinds of payments were terminated in the 2014 Farm Bill. (a) Helps: domestic farmers (b) Effect on farmers: raises their income Countercyclical payments: another type of decoupled subsidy, which is not based on a farmer‚Äôs current production decisions but rather on their historical production quantities. They are made on years when the market price of a product is comparatively low and are usually supplementary to direct payments and deficiency payments. (a) Helps: domestic farmers (b) Effect on farmers: raises their income Insurance: although farmers could get insurance for their crops from private companies the way it is done for cars or homes, the government understands that those insurance markets are inadequate, and that farmers cannot afford the premiums at market rate. However, risks in farming are very high so the government provides various insurance programs for reducing farmers‚Äô exposure to economic and weather risk. With one type of program, the government subsidizes the premium payment for insurance policies provided by a private insurance company as well as some of the administrative costs of the program. Another type of program provides disaster payments after a natural disaster and does not require a premium from farmers to receive the aid. (a) Helps: domestic farmers (b) Effect on farmers: raises their income Demand expansion: These types of programs seek to increase the quantity that consumers are willing to buy at each price, known in economics as the demand. This raises the price for the products and also the quantity of the product that is consumed. Examples of these programs in the United States include the Renewable Fuels Standard for increasing the demand of corn, commodity checkoff programs for increasing the demand for beef, and export promotion programs for increasing the demand for food products created from corn. (a) Helps: farmers of the product for which demand is expanded (b) Effect on product price: raises the prices for farmers and consumers (c) Effect on product quantities: increase These are some of the mechanisms available to governments for affecting food production, farmer incomes, and food prices in their countries. By affecting what happens locally, countries may also have an effect on what happens internationally. The size of the effect depends on how much of a certain good a country produces and sells on the international market relative to other countries. This makes farm programs potentially controversial, because they offer a way for countries to give their farmers an advantage over those in other countries and also because they can affect agricultural economies abroad.

Agricultural economists have analyzed the distinctions among farm sizes since the field's inception. Traditional agricultural economic theory considered small farms inefficient, a stance that began to be challenged in the 1950s. An overview of research published by the World Bank in 1998 indicated that the productivity of small farms often exceeded that of larger ones. United States Several definitions of the term have been formulated in legislation. In 1977 the US Congress, via the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977, defined a small farm as one with sales under $20,000. At the time these comprised 70% of farms in the US. The Act sponsored additional research on small farming operations by US land grant universities and their extension services and mandated that an annual report on these activities be issued by the US Secretary of Agriculture. A 1997 study by the United States Small Farms Commission defined small farms as those with less than $250,000 in gross receipts annually on which day-to-day labor and management are provided by the farmer and/or the farm family that owns the production, or owns or leases the productive assets. In 2000, such farms accounted for about 90% of the more than 2.1 million U.S. farms, but only about 40% of U.S. farm production. The concentration of production on fewer and larger operations is a longstanding concern among some segments of the agricultural community. Others view these changes as inevitable, and even necessary to maintain the efficiency and competitiveness of the sector. Farm typology analysis by the USDA Economic Research Service divides the small family farm category into five groups: #limited-resource farms; #retirement farms; #residential/lifestyle farms; #farming occupation/lower-sales, #farming occupation/high-sales. =Technology for small farmers= Many farmers are upset by their inability to fix the new types of high-tech farm equipment. This is due mostly to companies using intellectual property law to prevent farmers from having the legal right to fix their equipment (or gain access to the information to allow them to do it). This has encouraged groups such as Open Source Ecology and Farm Hack to begin to make open source agricultural machinery. European Union Debate concerning the role of small farms within the European Union is ongoing. As of 2009, it had not established a formal definition of the term that could be used in its Common Agricultural Policy, although public perception of their possible benefits has led to requests for further studies from the European Commission.

Paglia has been a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, since 1984. She is critical of many aspects of modern culture and is the author of Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson (1990) and other books. She is also a critic of contemporary American feminism and of post-structuralism, as well as a commentator on multiple aspects of American culture such as its visual art, music, and film history. Personal life Paglia was born in Endicott, New York, the eldest child of Pasquale and Lydia Anne (n√©e Colapietro) Paglia. All four of her grandparents were born in Italy. Her mother emigrated to the United States at five years old from Ceccano, in the province of Frosinone, Lazio, Italy.https://youtube.com/pg0hPidLPCk?t=41m37s Paglia has stated that her father's side of the family was from the Campanian towns of Avellino, Benevento, and Caserta. Paglia was raised Roman Catholic, and attended primary school in rural Oxford, New York, where her family lived in a working farmhouse. Her father, a veteran of World War II, taught at the Oxford Academy high school and exposed his young daughter to art through books he brought home about French art history. In 1957, her family moved to Syracuse, New York, so that her father could begin graduate school; he eventually became a professor of Romance languages at Le Moyne College. She attended the Edward Smith Elementary School, T. Aaron Levy Junior High, and William Nottingham High School. In 1992, Carmelia Metosh, her Latin teacher for three years, said, \\"She always has been controversial. Whatever statements were being made (in class), she had to challenge them. She made good points then, as she does now.\\" Paglia thanked Metosh in the acknowledgements to Sexual Personae, later describing her as \\"the dragon lady of Latin studies, who breathed fire at principals and school boards\\". During her stays at a summer Girl Scout camp in Thendara, New York, she took on a variety of new names, including Anastasia (her confirmation name, inspired by the film Anastasia), Stacy, and Stanley. A crucially significant event for her was when an outhouse exploded after she poured too much quicklime into the latrine. \\"That symbolized everything I would do with my life and work. Excess and extravagance and explosiveness. I would be someone who would look into the latrine of culture, into pornography and crime and psychopathology ... and I would drop the bomb into it\\". For more than a decade, Paglia was the partner of artist Alison Maddex. Paglia legally adopted Maddex's son (who was born in 2002). In 2007 the couple separated but remained \\"harmonious co-parents,\\" in Paglia's words, who lived two miles apart. Paglia identifies as transgender and stated that she has \\"never identified at all with being a woman\\". Education Paglia entered Harpur College at Binghamton University in 1964. The same year, Paglia's poem \\"Atrophy\\" was published in the local newspaper. She later said that she was trained to read literature by poet Milton Kessler, who \\"believed in the responsiveness of the body, and of the activation of the senses to literature ... And oh did I believe in that\\". She graduated from Harpur as class valedictorian in 1968. According to Paglia, while in college she punched a \\"marauding drunk,\\" and takes pride in having been put on probation for committing 39 pranks. Paglia attended Yale as a graduate student, and she claims to have been the only open lesbian at Yale Graduate School from 1968 to 1972. At Yale, Paglia quarreled with Rita Mae Brown, whom she later characterized as \\"then darkly nihilist,\\" and argued with the New Haven, Connecticut, Women's Liberation Rock Band when they dismissed the Rolling Stones as sexist.\\"Letter to the Editor\\", Camille Paglia, \\"Chronicle of Higher Education\\", June 17, 1998. Paglia was mentored by Harold Bloom. Sexual Personae was then titled \\"The Androgynous Dream: the image of the androgyne as it appears in literature and is embodied in the psyche of the artist, with reference to the visual arts and the cinema.\\" Paglia read Susan Sontag and aspired to emulate what she called her \\"celebrity, her positioning in the media world at the border of the high arts and popular culture.\\" Paglia first saw Sontag in person on October 15, 1969 (Vietnam Moratorium Day), when Paglia, then a Yale graduate student, was visiting a friend at Princeton. In 1973, Paglia, a militant feminist and open lesbian, was working at her first academic job at Bennington College. She considered Sontag a radical who had challenged male dominance. The same year, Paglia drove to an appearance by Sontag at Dartmouth, hoping to arrange for her to speak at Bennington, but found it difficult to find the money for Sontag's speaking fee; Paglia relied on help from Richard Tristman, a friend of Sontag's, to persuade her to come. Bennington College agreed to pay Sontag $700 (twice what they usually offered speakers but only half Sontag's usual fee) to give a talk about contemporary issues. Paglia staged a poster campaign urging students to attend Sontag's appearance. Sontag arrived at Bennington Carriage Barn, where she was to speak, more than an hour late, and then began reading what Paglia recalled as a \\"boring and bleak\\" short story about \\"nothing\\" in the style of a French New Novel. As a result of Sontag's Bennington College appearance, Paglia began to become disenchanted with her, believing that she had withdrawn from confrontation with the academic world, and that her \\"mandarin disdain\\" for popular culture showed an elitism that betrayed her early work, which had suggested that high and low culture both reflected a new sensibility. Career In the autumn of 1972, Paglia began teaching at Bennington College, which hired her in part thanks to a recommendation from Harold Bloom. At Bennington, she befriended the philosopher James Fessenden, who first taught there in the same semester. Through her study of the classics and the scholarly work of Jane Ellen Harrison, James George Frazer, Erich Neumann and others, Paglia developed a theory of sexual history that contradicted a number of ideas fashionable at the time, hence her criticism of Marija Gimbutas, Carolyn Heilbrun, Kate Millett and others. She laid out her ideas on matriarchy, androgyny, homosexuality, sadomasochism and other topics in her Yale PhD thesis Sexual Personae: The Androgyne in Literature and Art, which she defended in December 1974. In September 1976, she gave a public lecture drawing on that dissertation, in which she discussed Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene, followed by remarks on Diana Ross, Gracie Allen, Yul Brynner, and St√©phane Audran. Paglia wrote that she \\"nearly came to blows with the founding members of the women's studies program at the State University of New York at Albany, when they categorically denied that hormones influence human experience or behavior\\". Similar fights with feminists and academics culminated in a 1978 incident which led her to resign from Bennington; after a lengthy standoff with the administration, Paglia accepted a settlement from the college and resigned in 1979. Paglia finished Sexual Personae in the early 1980s, but could not get it published. She supported herself with visiting and part-time teaching jobs at Yale, Wesleyan, and other Connecticut colleges. Her paper, \\"The Apollonian Androgyne and the Faerie Queene\\", was published in English Literary Renaissance, Winter 1979, and her dissertation was cited by J. Hillis Miller in his April 1980 article \\"Wuthering Heights and the Ellipses of Interpretation\\", in Journal of Religion in Literature, but her academic career was otherwise stalled. In a 1995 letter to Boyd Holmes, she recalled: \\"I earned a little extra money by doing some local features reporting for a New Haven alternative newspaper (The Advocate) in the early 1980s\\". She wrote articles on New Haven's historic pizzerias and on an old house that was a stop on the Underground Railroad. In 1984, she joined the faculty of the Philadelphia College of Performing Arts, which merged in 1987 with the Philadelphia College of Art to become the University of the Arts. Paglia is on the editorial board of the classics and humanities journal Arion. She wrote a regular column for Salon.com from 1995 to 2001, and again from 2007 to 2009. Paglia resumed writing a Salon.com column in 2016. Paglia cooperated with Carl Rollyson and Lisa Paddock in their writing of Susan Sontag: The Making of an Icon, sending them detailed letters from which they quoted with her permission. Rollyson and Paddock note that Sontag \\"had her lawyer put our publisher on notice\\" when she realized that they were investigating her life and career. Paglia participates in the decennial poll of film professionals conducted by Sight & Sound which asks participants to submit a list of what they believe to be the ten greatest films of all time. According to her responses to the poll in 2002 and 2012, the films Paglia holds in highest regard include Ben-Hur, Citizen Kane, La Dolce Vita, The Godfather, The Godfather: Part II, Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, North by Northwest, Orph√©e, Persona, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Ten Commandments, and Vertigo. In 2005, Paglia was named as one of the top 100 public intellectuals by the journals Foreign Policy and Prospect. In 2012, an article in The New York Times remarked that who has been following the body count of the culture wars over the past decades knows Paglia\\". Paglia has said that she is willing to have her entire career judged on the basis of her composition of what she considers to be \\"probably the most important sentence that she has ever written\\": \\"God is man's greatest idea.\\" Views=Feminism= Though Paglia admires Simone de Beauvoir and The Second Sex (\\"the supreme work of modern feminism ... its deep learning and massive argument are unsurpassed\\") as well as Germaine Greer, Time critic Martha Duffy writes that Paglia \\"does not hesitate to hurl brazen insults\\" at several feminists. In an interview, Paglia stated that to be effective, one has to \\"name names\\"; criticism should be concrete. Paglia stated that many critics \\"escape into abstractions\\", rendering their criticism \\"intellectualized and tame\\". Paglia accused Greer of becoming \\"a drone in three years\\" as a result of her early success; Paglia has also criticized the work of activist Diana Fuss. Elaine Showalter calls Paglia \\"unique in the hyperbole and virulence of her hostility to virtually all the prominent feminist activists, public figures, writers and scholars of her generation\\", mentioning Carolyn Heilbrun, Judith Butler, Carol Gilligan, Marilyn French, Zoe Baird, Kimba Wood, Susan Thomases, and Hillary Clinton as targets of her criticism. Paglia has accused Kate Millett of starting \\"the repressive, Stalinist style in feminist criticism.\\" Paglia has repeatedly criticized Patricia Ireland, former president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), calling her a \\"sanctimonious\\", unappealing role model for women whose \\"smug, arrogant\\" attitude is accompanied by \\"painfully limited processes of thought\\". Paglia contends that under Ireland's leadership, NOW \\"damaged and marginalized the women's movement\\". In 1999, Martha Nussbaum wrote an essay called \\"The Professor of Parody\\", in which she criticized Judith Butler for retreating to abstract theory disconnected from real world problems. Paglia reacted to the essay by stating that the criticism was \\"long overdue\\", but characterized the criticism as \\"one PC diva turning against another\\". She criticized Nussbaum for failing to make her criticisms earlier while accusing her of borrowing Paglia's ideas without acknowledgement. She called Nussbaum's \\"preparation or instinct for sex analysis ... dubious at best\\", but nevertheless stated that \\"Nussbaum is a genuine scholar who operates on a vastly higher intellectual level than Butler\\". Many feminists have criticized Paglia; Christina Hoff Sommers calls her \\"Perhaps the most conspicuous target of feminist opprobrium,\\" noting that the Women's Review of Books described Sexual Personae as patriarchy's \\"counter-assault on feminism\\". Sommers relates that when Paglia appeared at a Brown University forum, feminists signed a petition censuring her and demanding an investigation into procedures for inviting speakers to the campus. Some feminist critics have characterized Paglia as an \\"anti-feminist feminist\\", critical of central features of much contemporary feminism but holding out \\"her own special variety of feminist affirmation\\". Naomi Wolf traded a series of sometimes personal attacks with Paglia throughout the early 1990s. In The New Republic, Wolf wrote that Paglia \\"poses as a sexual renegade but is in fact the most dutiful of patriarchal daughters\\" and characterized Paglia as intellectually dishonest. In a 1991 speech, Paglia criticized Wolf for blaming anorexia on the media. Gloria Steinem said of Paglia that, \\"Her calling herself a feminist is sort of like a Nazi saying they're not anti-Semitic.\\" Paglia called Steinem \\"the Stalin of feminism\\". Katha Pollitt calls Paglia one of a \\"seemingly endless parade of social critics [who] have achieved celebrity by portraying not sexism but feminism as the problem\\". Pollitt writes that Paglia has glorified \\"male dominance\\", and has been able to get away with things \\"that might make even Rush Limbaugh blanch,\\" because she is a woman. Paglia's view that rape is sexually motivated has been endorsed by evolutionary psychologists Randy Thornhill and Craig T. Palmer; they comment that \\"Paglia ... urges women to be skeptical toward the feminist 'party line' on the subject, to become better informed about risk factors, and to use the information to lower their risk of rape\\". In an essay critiquing the Hollywood/celebrity fad of \\"Girl Squads\\", made popular in 2015 by pop-icons like Taylor Swift, Paglia argued that rather than empowering women the cliquish practice actually harms the self-esteem of those who aren't rich, famous, or attractive enough to belong to the group, while further defining women only by a very narrow, often sexualized stereotype. She challenged that to be truly empowering, these groups need to mentor, advise, and be more inclusive, for more women to realize their true, individual potential. =French thought= Paglia is critical of the influence modern French writers have had on the humanities, claiming that universities are in the \\"thrall\\" of French post-structuralists; that in the works of Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan and Michel Foucault, she never once found a sentence that interested her; and that post-structuralism has broken the link between the word and the thing, and thus endangers the Western canon. Fran√ßois Cusset writes that Paglia, like other major American public intellectuals after World War II, owes her broader recognition mainly to the political repercussions of polemics that first erupted on college campuses, in her case to a polemic against foreign intellectualism. He says she achieved phenomenal success when she called Foucault a \\"bastard\\", thereby providing (together with Alan Sokal's Social Text parody) the best evidence for Paul de Man's view that theory should be defined negatively, based on the opposition it arouses. However, Paglia's assessment of French writers is not purely negative. She has called Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (1949) \\"brilliant\\" and identified Jean-Paul Sartre's work as part of a high period in literature. Paglia has praised Roland Barthes' Mythologies (1957) and Gilles Deleuze's Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty (1967), while finding both men's later work flawed. Of Gaston Bachelard, who influenced Paglia, she wrote \\"[his] dignified yet fluid phenomenological descriptive method seemed to me ideal for art\\", adding that he was \\"the last modern French writer I took seriously\\". =Politics= Paglia characterizes herself as a libertarian. She opposes laws against prostitution, pornography, drugs, and abortion. She is also opposed to affirmative action laws. Some of her views have been characterized as conservative. She is critical of current transgender discourse and has long rejected what she describes as \\"the political agenda that has slowly accrued\\" around the issue of climate change. In a 2017 interview with The Weekly Standard, Paglia stated, \\"It is certainly ironic how liberals who posture as defenders of science when it comes to global warming (a sentimental myth unsupported by evidence) flee all reference to biology when it comes to gender.\\" Paglia criticized Bill Clinton for not resigning after the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which she says \\"paralyzed the government for two years, leading directly to our blindsiding by 9/11\\". In the 2000 U.S. presidential campaign, she voted for the Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, \\"[because] I detest the arrogant, corrupt superstructure of the Democratic Party, with which I remain stubbornly registered.\\" In the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Paglia supported John Kerry, and in 2008 she supported Barack Obama. In 2012, she supported Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Paglia was highly critical of 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, calling her a \\"fraud\\" and a \\"liar\\". Paglia refused to support either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, indicating in a March Salon column that if Hillary Clinton won the Democratic Party's nomination, she would either cast a write-in vote for Bernie Sanders or else vote for Green Party candidate Stein, as she did in 2012. Paglia later clarified in a statement that she would vote for Stein. In 2017, she stated that she is a registered Democrat who voted for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary and for Jill Stein in the 2016 general election. =Child sexuality= In 1993, Paglia signed a manifesto supporting NAMBLA, a pederasty and pedophilia advocacy organization. In 1994, Paglia supported lowering the legal age of consent to fourteen. She noted in a 1995 interview with pro-pedophile activist Bill Andriette \\"I fail to see what is wrong with erotic fondling with any age.\\" In a 1997 Salon column, Paglia expressed the view that male pedophilia correlates with the heights of a civilization, stating \\"I have repeatedly protested the lynch-mob hysteria that dogs the issue of man-boy love. In Sexual Personae, I argued that male pedophilia is intricately intertwined with the cardinal moments of Western civilization.\\" Paglia noted in several interviews, as well as Sexual Personae, that she supports the legalization of certain forms of child pornography. She later had a change of heart on the matter. In an interview for Radio New Zealand's Saturday Morning show, conducted on April 28, 2018 by Kim Hill, Paglia was asked, \\"Are you a libertarian on the issue of pedophilia?\\", to which she replied, \\"In terms of the present day, I think it's absolutely impossible to think we could reproduce the Athenian code of pedophilia, of boy-love, that was central to culture at that time. ... We must protect children, and I feel that very very strongly. The age of consent for sexual interactions between a boy and an older man is obviously disputed, at what point that should be. I used to think that fourteen (the way it is in some places in the world) was adequate. I no longer think that. I think young people need greater protection than that. ... This is one of those areas that we must confine to the realm of imagination and the history of the arts.\\" Books=Sexual Personae= Paglia's Sexual Personae was rejected by at least seven different publishers before it was published by Yale University Press, whereupon it became a best seller, reaching seventh place on the paperback best-seller list, a rare accomplishment for a scholarly book. 'Paglia called it her \\"prison book\\", commenting, \\"I felt like Cervantes, Genet. It took all the resources of being Catholic to cut myself off and sit in my cell.\\" Sexual Personae has been called an \\"energetic, Freud-friendly reading of Western art\\", one that seemed \\"heretical and perverse\\", at the height of political correctness; according to Daniel Nester, its characterization of \\"William Blake as the British Marquis de Sade or Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson as 'self-ruling hermaphrodites who cannot mate' still pricks up many an English major's ears\\". In the book, Paglia argues that human nature has an inherently dangerous Dionysian or chthonic aspect, especially in regard to sexuality. Culture and civilization are created by men and represent an attempt to contain that force. Women are powerful, too, but as natural forces, and both marriage and religion are means to contain chaotic forces. A best seller, it was described by Terry Teachout in a New York Times book review as being both \\"intellectually stimulating\\" and \\"exasperating\\". Sexual Personae received critical reviews from numerous feminist scholars.See the following:   Anthony Burgess described Sexual Personae as \\"a fine disturbing book\\" that \\"seeks to attack the reader's emotions as well as his or her prejudices\\". =Sex, Art and American Culture= Sex, Art and American Culture: Essays (1992) is a collection of short pieces, many published previously as editorials or reviews, and some transcripts of interviews. The essays cover such subjects as Madonna, Elizabeth Taylor, rock music, Robert Mapplethorpe, the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination, rape, Marlon Brando, drag, Milton Kessler, and academia. It made The New York Times bestseller list for paperbacks. =Vamps and Tramps= Vamps and Tramps: New Essays (1994) is a collection of 42 short articles and a long essay, \\"No Law in the Arena: a Pagan Theory of Sexuality\\". It also contains a collection of cartoons from newspapers about Paglia. Writing for The New York Times, Wendy Steiner wrote \\"Comic, camp, outspoken, Ms. Paglia throws an absurdist shoe into the ponderous wheels of academia\\". Michiko Kakutani, also writing for The New York Times, wrote: \\"Her writings on education ... are highly persuasive, just as some of her essays on the perils of regulating pornography and the puritanical excesses of the women's movement radiate a fierce common sense ... Unfortunately, Ms. Paglia has a way of undermining her more interesting arguments with flip, hyperbolic declarations\\". =The Birds= In 1998, in commemoration of the 35th anniversary of the release of Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds, the British Film Institute commissioned Paglia to write a book about the film. The book interprets the film as \\"in the main line of British Romanticism descending from the raw nature-tableaux and sinister femme-fatales of Coleridge\\". Paglia uses a psychoanalytic framework to interpret the film as portraying \\"a release of primitive forces of sex and appetite that have been subdued but never fully tamed\\".McCombe p.267 =Break, Blow, Burn= Break, Blow, Burn: Camille Paglia Reads Forty-three of the World's Best Poems (2005) is a collection of 43 short selections of verse with an accompanying essay by Paglia. The collection is oriented primarily to those unfamiliar with the works. Clive James noted that Paglia tends to focus on American works as it moves from Shakespeare forward through time, with Yeats, following Coleridge, as the last European discussed, but emphasized her range of sympathy and her ability to juxtapose and unite distinct art forms in her analysis. Christopher Nield remarked that Paglia has \\"a rare gift to capture a poem's mood and scene in terse, spiky phrases of descriptive insight\\" and exhibits brilliance, but also notes that some of her selections from recent writers fall flat. He also praises her pedagogical slant towards basic interpretation, suggesting that her approach might be what is required to reinvigorate studies in the humanities. =Glittering Images= Glittering Images: A Journey Through Art from Egypt to Star Wars (2012) is a series of essays about notable works of art from ancient to modern times, published in October 2012.Book description on Random House website. Writer John Adams of The New York Times Book Review was skeptical of the book, accusing it of being \\"so agenda driven and so riddled with polemic asides that its potential to persuade is forever being compromised\\". Gary Rosen of The Wall Street Journal, however, praised the book's \\"impressive range\\" and accessibility to readers. =Free Women, Free Men= Paglia's Free Women, Free Men: Sex, Gender, and Feminism was published by Pantheon in 2017. It is a series of essays from 1990 onward. Dwight Garner in The New York Times wrote Paglia's essays address two main targets: modern feminism, which, Paglia writes, \\"has become a catchall vegetable drawer where bunches of clingy sob sisters can store their moldy neuroses,\\" and modern American universities, of which she asks, \\"How is it possible that today‚Äôs academic left has supported rather than protested campus speech codes as well as the grotesque surveillance and overregulation of student life?\\" = Provocations = Paglia's fourth essay collection, Provocations: Collected Essays, was published by Pantheon on October 9, 2018.

It received its Royal Charter in 1885 and was one of the founding institutions of the federal University of Wales. Officially known as University College of North Wales (UCNW), and later University of Wales, Bangor (UWB; ), in 2007 it became Bangor University, independent from the University of Wales. History The pre 1926 site of the University College of Wales Bangor The university was founded as the University College of North Wales (UCNW) on 18 October 1884, with an inaugural address by the Earl of Powis, the College's first President, in Penrhyn Hall.David Roberts (2009) Bangor University 1884‚Äì2009, University of Wales Press There was then a procession to the college including 3,000 quarrymen (quarrymen from Penrhyn Quarry and other quarries had subscribed more than 1,200 pounds to the university).The Times, Monday, 20 October 1884; pg. 7; Issue 31269; col F The foundation was the result of a campaign for better provision of higher education in Wales that had involved some rivalry among towns in North Wales over which was to be the location of the new college. The college was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1885. Its students received degrees from the University of London until 1893, when UCNW became a founding constituent institution of the federal University of Wales. During the Second World War paintings from national art galleries were stored in the Prichard-Jones Hall at UCNW to protect them from enemy bombing. They were later moved to slate mines at Blaenau Ffestiniog. Students from University College, London, were evacuated to continue their studies in a safer environment at Bangor. =Post-war= During the 1960s the university shared in the general expansion of higher education in the UK following the Robbins Report, with a number of new departments and new buildings. On 22 November 1965, during construction of an extension to the Department of Electronic Engineering in Dean Street, a crane collapsed on the building. The three-ton counterweight hit the second-floor lecture theatre in the original building about thirty minutes before it would have been occupied by about 80 first-year students. The counterweight went through to the ground floor.The Guardian, 23 November 1965, p. 6. In 1967 the Bangor Normal College, now part of the university, was the venue for lectures on Transcendental Meditation by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at which The Beatles heard of the death of their manager, Brian Epstein. Student protests at UCNW in the 1970s focused mainly on calls to expand the role of the Welsh language. Around this time consideration began of mergers with two colleges of education in Bangor: St Mary's College, a college for women studying to become schoolteachers, and the larger and older Normal College/Coleg Normal. The merger of St Mary's into UCNW was concluded in 1977, but the merger with Coleg Normal fell through in the 1970s and was not completed until 1996. =Name change= The change of name to Bangor University, or Prifysgol Bangor in Welsh, was instigated by the university following the decision of the University of Wales to change from a federal university to a confederal non-membership organisation, and the granting of degree-awarding powers to Bangor University itself. As a result, every student starting after 2009 gained a degree from Bangor University, while any student who started before 2009 had the option to have either Bangor University or University of Wales Bangor on their degree certificate. Main Arts and other Bangor University buildings from Bangor Mountain Under John Hughes's leadership as Vice-Chancellor, there were a number of new developments including the opening of St Mary's Student Village, and the first ever collaboration between Wales and China to establish a new college, which involved Bangor University and the Central South University of Forestry and Technology (CSUFT). In 2014, Hughes attracted ¬£45m of financing from the European Investment Bank, to assist the university in developing its estates strategy. In 2016, the university opened Marine Centre Wales, a ¬£5.5m building on the site of the university's Ocean Sciences campus in Menai Bridge, which was financed as part of the ¬£25 million SEACAMS project, part funded through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). In May 2017, Bangor became the fourth Welsh university to review its cost base with a view to making savings of ¬£8.5m. The university responded and introduced a number of cost saving measures including the introduction of a voluntary severance scheme, and the numbers of jobs at risk was reduced from the initial estimate of 170. In addressing its financial challenges, Bangor University also reorganised some subject areas in 2017, which involved introducing new ways of co-ordinating and delivering adult education and part-time degree programmes, continuing to teach archaeology, but discontinuing the single honours course, and working with Grwp Llandrillo Menai to validate the BA Fine Art degree. Other issues which attracted adverse media comment included the cost overrun and delayed opening of the Pontio Arts and Innovation Centre in 2016, the appointment of Hughes's then wife to a newly created senior management position, the purchase and refurbishment of a house for the vice-chancellor by the university (costing the institution ¬£750,000), the expenses of some senior staff, and the discrepancy between senior management salaries and remuneration for staff working on zero hour contracts. In 2016, Hughes received a 7.5% pay rise and the university confirmed that this was the first increase that the vice- chancellor had received from the university's remuneration committee (of which Hughes himself was a member) since his appointment in 2010, although he would still have received an annual pay rise. From Hughes's takeover in 2010, when Bangor University made a ¬£4.2 million profit, to 2017, the university's nominal income had risen by 12 per cent, but their expenditures by 19 per cent with the university's interests and finance costs (despite very low interest rates) soaring by 747 per cent. In early 2019, an accountant who studied the university's finances on behalf of trade union criticised that the figures suggested spending had been diverted from staff costs to financing building projects. When a new financial crisis as well as allegations of Hughes's racist and sexist harassment against his ex-wife were revealed in late 2018 and the announced closure of the chemistry department and new staff cuts sparked student protest, Bangor University announced Hughes's resignation by December 2018, eight months ahead of his ordinary retirement. Campus and buildings The university occupies a substantial proportion of Bangor and also has part of its School of Healthcare Sciences in Wrexham. =Arts Building= The quadrangle in the main college building on College Road The university was originally based in an old coaching inn, the Penrhyn Arms Hotel, which housed its 58 students and its 12 teaching staff. In 1911 it moved to a much larger new building, which is now the old part of the Main Arts Building. This building, designed by Henry Hare, had its foundation stone laid by King Edward VII on 9 July 1907, and was formally opened by King George V in 1911. The iconic building, which occupies a highly visible position overlooking Bangor, gave the college its Welsh nickname Y Coleg ar y Bryn (\\"The College on the Hill\\"). It included the large Prichard-Jones Hall, named after Sir John Prichard-Jones a local man who became a partner in the London department store Dickins & Jones, and was a substantial benefactor of the building. The building became a Grade I listed building in 1949. A modern extension, completing a quadrangle on the College Road side of the building, was completed in 1969. This is now known as the Main Arts Building. =Halls of residence= The redbrick University Hall, built in a Queen Anne style, was the first substantial block. It was opened in 1897.M L Clarke (1966) Architectural History and Guide, University College of North Wales Online at Bangor Civic Society This building was to become the Welsh-language hall Neuadd John Morris-Jones in 1974, taking its name in honour of Professor John Morris Jones. It is now called Neuadd Rathbone. Neuadd Reichel, built on the Ffriddoedd Farm site, was designed in a neo-Georgian style by the architect Percy Thomas and was opened in 1942 as a hostel for male students. Expansion in the 1960s led to the development of Plas Gwyn in 1963‚Äì64 and Neuadd Emrys Evans in 1965, both on the Ffriddoedd site, and Neuadd Rathbone at the top of Love Lane in 1965. Neuadd Rathbone, designed by Colwyn Foulkes and named after the second President of the college, was originally for women students only. The names of Neuadd Rathbone and Neuadd John Morris-Jones were later exchanged. The building originally opened as Neuadd Rathbone is now known as Neuadd Garth. Accommodation is guaranteed for all first-year undergraduate students at Bangor. There are around 3,000 rooms available in halls of residence, and all the accommodation is within walking distance of the university. There are three residential sites in current use: Ffriddoedd Village, St Mary's Village and Neuadd Garth. Ffriddoedd Village  Ffriddoedd Halls of Residence village with Bryn Dinas Hall in the background The largest accommodation site is the Ffriddoedd Village in Upper Bangor, about ten minutes' walk from Top College, the Science Site and the city centre. This site has eleven en-suite halls completed in 2009, six other en- suite halls built in the 1990s and Neuadd Reichel built in the 1940s, and renovated in 2011. Two of the en-suite halls, Bryn Dinas and Tegfan, now incorporate the new Neuadd John Morris-Jones, which started its life in 1974 on College Road and has, along with its equivalent Neuadd Pantycelyn in Aberystwyth, became a focal point of Welsh-language activities at the university. It is an integral part of UMCB, the Welsh Students' Union, which in turn is part of the main Students' Union. The halls on \\"Ffridd\\" (ffridd [friÀê√∞] is the Welsh word for mountain pasture or sheep path; ffriddoedd [Ààfr…™√∞…îi√∞] is its plural form) include Cefn y Coed, Glyder, Borth, Elidir, J.M.J. Bryn Dinas and J.M.J. Tegfan, all of which were built in the early 1990s; Adda, Alaw, Braint, Crafnant, Enlli, Peris, Glaslyn, Llanddwyn, Ffraw, Idwal and Gwynant, which were all built in the late 2000s; and Neuadd Reichel which was built in the 1940s and renovated in 2011. St Mary's Village  Bryn Eithin overlooks the centre of Bangor and is close to the Science Departments and the Schools of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering. Demolition of the former St Mary's Site halls, with the exception of the 1902 buildings and the Quadrangle, began in 2014 to make way for new halls which were completed in 2015. The halls on this site are Cybi, Penmon, and Cemlyn, which are all self-catered flats; Tudno, which is a townhouse complex; and the original St. Mary's building, with studios and flats. In Welsh, bryn means \\"hill\\" and eithin means \\"gorse\\". College Road College Road has one hall, Neuadd Garth (formerly Neuadd John Morris Jones, before that Neuadd Rathbone), which is a self-catering hall. The site is located close to the Main Arts building in Upper Bangor. Neuadd Garth, after undergoing refurbishment in 2012‚Äì13, is now home to postgraduate students. Neuadd Rathbone (formerly Neuadd John Morris Jones, before that University Hall), which is located on the site, was previously a hall of residence. Private halls A private hall of residence called T≈∑ Willis House (formerly known as Neuadd Willis) is operated by iQ Student Accommodation; which incorporates the old listed British Hotel with a new extension to the rear, and a further hall on the site of the old Plaza Cinema. Other privately owned halls of residence in Bangor include Neuadd Kyffin, Neuadd y Castell, Neuadd Llys y Deon and Neuadd T≈∑ Ni. =Students union= The Former Students' Union Building from Deiniol Road Undeb Bangor is Bangor University's Students' Union and was relocated to the brand new Arts and Innovation centre, Pontio, in 2016. Pontio includes a theatre, a cinema, a studio theatre and social facilities including the Undeb on the 4th floor. The former Students' Union building was situated on Deiniol Road at one end of College Park below the Main Arts building. The Refectory and Curved Lounge were built in 1963 and the main administrative building was added in 1969. The building was known as Steve Biko House from the 1970s to the early 1990s, after Steve Biko. The buildings were renovated in 1997 to create an 1,100-capacity nightclub, Amser/Time, where the previous refectory space was. Demolition of the Union buildings and Theatr Gwynedd began in July 2010. When the original Students' Union building was demolished, the Students' Union was relocated to Oswalds on Victoria Drive, before moving back to its original location on Deiniol Road in 2016. Organisation Bangor University, School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science The Academic Activities of Bangor University are grouped into three colleges: ; College of Arts, Humanities and Business * Bangor Business School * School of History, Philosophy and Social Sciences * School of Language, Literatures and Linguistics * School of Law * School of Music and Media * School of Welsh and Celtic Studies * Centre for Research on Bilingualism ; College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering * School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering * School of Natural Sciences * School of Ocean Sciences * The BioComposites Centre ; College of Human Sciences * School of Education and Human Development * School of Health Sciences * School of Medical Sciences * School of Psychology * School of Sport, Health and Exercise Sciences Academic profile=Research= The university's research expertise in the areas of materials science and predictive modelling was enhanced during 2017 through a collaboration with Imperial College London and the formation of the Nuclear Futures Institute at Bangor with the award of ¬£6.5m in funding under the Welsh Government's Ser Cymru programme. The university-owned ¬£20m Science Park on Anglesey, M-Sparc was completed in March 2018, which will support the development of the region's low carbon energy sector. = Rankings = The 2014 Research Excellence Framework recognised that more than three quarters of Bangor's research is either world-leading or internationally excellent. Based on the university submission of 14 Units of Assessment, 77% of the research was rated in the top two tiers of research quality, ahead of the average for all UK universities. In 2017, Bangor University became the only university in Wales to be rated 'Gold' by the new Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) which means that the university is deemed to be of the highest quality found in the UK, providing \\"consistently outstanding teaching, learning and outcomes for its students.\\" In recent years, Bangor has been rated highly by its students in two independent surveys of student opinion. In the National Student Survey, the university has been consistently ranked highly both within Wales and in the UK higher education sector. In 2017, Bangor University's students placed the university eighth among the UK's non-specialist universities and second among Welsh Universities. For the second year in a row Bangor was awarded Best University in the UK for Clubs and Societies at the 2018 WhatUni Student Choice Awards. It also regained the award for best Student Accommodation which they originally won in 2016. The university was also placed second overall for 'Courses and Lecturers' and retained third place in the category 'University of the Year'. WhatUni award nominations are based on the reviews and opinions of the university's own students. This is the fourth year in a row that Bangor University has won a national WhatUni Award. Student life=Students' union= The students' union provides services, support, activities and entertainment for students. All Bangor University students automatically become members of the students' union unless they choose to opt out. As with most if not all students' unions, a yearly election takes place in which a number of sabbatical officers are elected. These sabbatical officers are held accountable for the actions and decisions of the union, and often work closely with members of the Student Representative Council and other boards. In January 2016 Bangor Students' Union moved into the new Pontio Arts and Innovation Centre, Deiniol Road, Bangor. The New Student Centre provides students with free Sports and Societies, as well as the chance to become a course rep.  Volunteering  The Students' Union offers more than 600 volunteering opportunities in 35 community-based projects, contributing a total of 600 hours to volunteering each week. There is a long tradition of student volunteering in Bangor. The oldest records available detail the organisation of a tea party for local elderly residents in 1952. The Tea Party project continues to run to this day and is SVB's oldest project. In October 2012 Student Volunteering Bangor was awarded the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service. Bangor RAG (Raising and Giving) is a Student Volunteering Bangor project. The committee is made up of two coordinators and a number of committee members, plus several hundred \\"raggies\\". RAG collects money for two local and two national charities, which change every academic year and are chosen by the students. RAG members also regularly attend \\"raids\\" across the country and assist charities with one-off events throughout the year. Their mascot is a tiger named Rhodri RAG. In 1968, raggies surepticiously carved a panda (then the RAG mascot) and the letters 'UCNW' into a chalk hillside in Wiltshire, causing considerable puzzlement in England. =Clubs and societies= There are more than 90 societies and over 50 sports clubs, ranging from academic societies to almost every sport imaginable. Notable sports include football (Bangor University F.C.), rowing (Bangor University Rowing Club), ultimate frisbee (Bangor University Ultimate Frisbee Club), and fencing (Bangor University Fencing Club). =Student newspaper= Y Seren is the official English language student newspaper for Bangor University. Seren provides coverage for important student events such as the sabbatical officer elections and the annual Varsity sports competition. The newspaper is delivered monthly to the Ffriddoedd and St Mary's Villages, as well as to University buildings and local businesses. Seren also has a website, where every issue is archived. The newspaper's offices are located in the Pontio Arts Centre building. =Student radio= Storm FM is the official student radio station for Bangor University and is one of only three student radio stations in the UK with a long-term FM licence. The station is broadcast on 87.7FM from a low-powered FM transmitter based on the Ffriddoedd Site.

It concerns the meeting of two Irishmen, Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus, in 1904 Dublin. Starring Milo O'Shea as Leopold Bloom, Barbara Jefford as Molly Bloom, Maurice Ro√´ves as Stephen Dedalus, T. P. McKenna as Buck Mulligan, and Sheila O'Sullivan as May Golding Dedalus, it was adapted by Fred Haines and Joseph Strick and directed by Strick. Haines and Strick shared an Oscar nomination for the screenplay. Making of the film This was the first film adaptation of the novel, 45 years after its publication. The film was shot on location in Dublin on a modest budget. Although the novel is set in 1904, the film portrays the city as it was in the 1960s. Critical reception Strick earned a BAFTA, Golden Globe and Oscar nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film was entered into the 1967 Cannes Film Festival. It was reportedly jeered at its first screening, but during the second showing, French subtitles in which Molly Bloom described sexual intercourse were seen to have been scrubbed out by a grease pencil, pushing audience sympathies toward Strick who had not been informed of the censorship beforehand.Shivas, Mark (May 7, 1967). \\"Frantic Cannes: Film Festival Comes Unwound\\". Los Angeles Times. Calendar, p. 1, 14. When Strick noticed the deletions during the film's screening, \\"he stood up and yelled out that this film had been censored\\", Strick's son David told the Los Angeles Times. \\"When I went to the projection room to protest, the committee was waiting for me\\", Joseph Strick later recalled. \\"I was forcibly ejected, pushed down the steps and suffered a broken foot. I withdrew the film from Cannes.\\" Reviews from some critics were very positive. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times put the film on his year-end list of the ten best films of 1967, declaring it \\"A faithful and brilliant screen translation of Joyce's classic novel, done with taste, imagination and cinema artistry.\\" Roger Ebert ranked the film second on his own year-end list (behind only Bonnie and Clyde), writing that it \\"went into the minds of recognizable human beings and revealed their thoughts about those things most important to them ‚Äì expressed in the only words they knew.\\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"presuming no familiarity with the novel, the film remains an engrossing experience‚Äîvery often superbly funny, frequently moving, a confrontation not with three but with more than a score of authentic and credible individuals.\\" Champlin's review concluded, \\"'Ulysses' is a remarkable achievement, a further chapter in the maturity of film.\\"Chaplin Charles (May 10, 1967). \\"Joyce's 'Ulysses' Makes Film Transition\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1, 16. Other reviews were negative. The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that \\"Joseph Strick's film version is, quite simply, a debasement of the novel. It could not have been otherwise, and Strick must have known this‚Äîso why bother in the first place? ... What one misses particularly is a sense of the author's presence, without which the book would be nothing‚Äîand without which the film is oddly and insistently impersonal.\\" Pauline Kael described it as \\"an act of homage in the form of readings ... plus slides.\\" Stanley Kauffmann called it \\"a facile and ludicrous reduction.\\"Robert Messenger, \\"Censors of the dirty '60s\\". The Canberra Times, 3 September 2001, p. 12 Rating and censorship  Ulysses was originally rated \\"X\\" in the UK after extensive cuts were demanded by BBFC censor John Trevelyan. However, director Joseph Strick replaced the offending dialogue with a series of screeches and sounds, thus rendering the scenes unintelligible. Eventually the film was released uncut in 1970, and the rating was reduced to \\"15\\" for the video release in 1996. In New Zealand, the film was originally restricted to adults over 21 in gender-segregated audiences.Brittenden, Wayne. The Celluloid Circus: The Heyday of the New Zealand Picture Theatre. New Zealand: Godwit (Random House), 2008, p. 134. The rating was reduced to \\"M\\" (suitable for mature audiences over 16) in the 1990s. In 1967, the film was banned in Ireland for being \\"subversive to public morality\\". The ban was upheld by the Films Appeal Board and placed on the film a second time in 1975. It was eventually lifted in September 2000 at the request of director Strick, although it was screened at the Irish Film Theatre (a private club cinema) in the late 1970s. The first public screening of the film in the country was held in February 2001, with then-censor Sheamus Smith and Strick both in attendance. It went on general release at the IFI from 8 February 2001. Cast The large number of characters in the novel is reflected in the large cast of the film.

History Iowa inventor William G. Dunn (1883‚Äì1968) originally owned a hardware business in Clarinda, Iowa. With the start of World War I, Dunn created the Dunn Counterbalance Company that operated out of the hardware store until he built a factory in Clarinda and renamed his company the Dunn Manufacturing Company. Dunn was responsible for 48 patents, 7 to do with wind power.http://www.dailygate.com/articles/2007/12/19/opinion/07.txt The Dunn Manufacturing Company also built a 3-seat Cruzeaire Monoplane in 1928. In 1936 Dunn teamed up with Cecil Lewis \\"Catfish\\" Parris, a marketing specialist, to form the Parris-Dunn company. The company was formed with Parris as President and Dunn as Vice President to sell a wind driven generator for farms to recharge electrical items. The Dunn Governing Principle was able to use a controllable propellor speed with fewer moving parts than other wind generators. The idea was successful with over 37,000 units created the next year that were sold throughout the USA and foreign countries. Philco Electronics contracted with Parris-Dunn to put their well known name on their \\"Skychargers\\" and marketed the items to their customers. World War II With surplus American arms sent to England and other countries prior to America's involvement in World War II, the American military suffered a severe shortage of rifles. As the U.S. Government decided that wind generators were not a priority item, Parris-Dunn could only manufacture spare parts for the ones in use. When the company sought some war work the government recommended making dummy training rifles with wood and metal that copied the M1903 Springfield.pp.95‚Äì97 Brophy, William S. The Springfield M1903 Rifles 1985 Stackpole Books Parris-Dunn U.S. Training Rifle Mk1 Navy Impressed by the rifles made for the US Army, the US Navy contacted Parris-Dunn in June 1942 to order their own rifles that they insisted have bayonet studs, adjustable rear sights, and working triggers with a clicker mechanism; the weapon becoming the USN MK 1 Dummy Training Rifle. The Navy ordered 190,000 for their first order. A plastic copy of the M1905 bayonet and scabbard was manufactured by the Pro- Phy-Lac-Tic Brush Company who usually manufactured toothbrushes. With walnut in high demand for real rifles, Parris-Dunn used cheaper wood further reducing the cost of the rifles. Over 500,000 rifles were produced with Parris-Dunn being awarded the Army-Navy ‚ÄòE‚Äô Award. Postwar With the end of the war, the training rifles were sold as surplus. From 1943, Parris had approached the company's chief engineer, Maurice Greiman with the idea of Parris-Dunn manufacturing toy weapon popguns of a Western style that shot corks for the use of children and traveling carnivals. Parris had Cowboy models called Cowboy Pla Guns, Trainerifles, and Shootrite guns in larger sizes for adults to practice cork gun marksmanship indoors.http://user.pa.net/~the.macs/PDTOY.html Dunn retired in 1949 with Parris moving the company to Savannah, Tennessee where it remains. During the Civil War Centennial the company manufactured replica cork shooting Civil War muskets and pistols. The company manufactured full size replicas of the M1903 Springfield and smaller sized models for children that featured a working bolt with a dummy bullet, leather sling, the clicker action, and a smaller rubber bayonet similar to the M1 bayonet. In the 1960s Parris used the cork gun design to make several types of BB guns.Beeman, Robert D. & Allen, John B. Blue Book of Air Guns 2007 Blue Book Publications So much of the mail to the Parris Manufacturing Company was missent to Savannah, Georgia that Cecil Parris visited the local post office and had the postmaster add \\"Catfish Capital of the World\\" to the postmark. Kadets of America In 1953 Parris started the idea of Kadet Military Drill Teams that communities could form. Purchasers of Kadet toy weapons would receive a free comic book drawn by Kurt Schaffenberger for Customs Comics Inc. telling the story of an imaginary boy named Bob Duncan who became a Kadet and advanced to the rank of Captain. The comic book featured instructions how to do the American manual of arms and offered the full range of Kadet Trainer Rifles, cork firing weapons, rank insignia, and dress and fatigue uniforms for both girls and boys featuring a white riding helmet. The brochure also featured a Kadet Officer's Training School located on a farm in Savannah and a Kadet song. From 1953 to around 1970 when the programme ended, the Kadets had over 16,000 members.

The Aquino family declined an invitation by government to grant the former president a state funeral.\\"Political Overtones Surround Aquino Funeral\\", New York Times accessdate=2009-08-5 Her funeral was held on August 5, 2009, and her body was buried at the Manila Memorial Park in Para√±aque. She is the first woman and the second President and layman after Carlos P. Garc√≠a to have their wake at the Manila Cathedral. Health=Diagnosis= In December 2007, Aquino experienced periodic fluctuations of blood pressure, difficulty in breathing, hair loss, loss of appetite and a remarkable drop in weight. Some days after, her physician informed the Aquino family that she had vaginal cancer, and by mid-March 2008, she confided the nature of her disease to a close friend, Rev Catalino Ar√©valo. On March 24, 2008, her youngest daughter, television presenter and actress Kris Aquino, disclosed that her mother began to experience cancer symptoms before 2008, difficulty in breathing, persistent cough and loss of appetite. Her only brother, then-senator Benigno Aquino III, was at her side as she made the announcement. Kris also said that the March 19 result of her mother's ultrasound revealed the disease was primarily due to adenocarcinoma, where the cancer started on colon glands. Her spokesperson, Deedee Sytangco, said that her colon cancer was at stage four prior to discovery. While she had initially been informed by physicians that she had only three months to live, Mme. Aquino pursued chemotherapy. Following the announcement, Malaca√±an Palace was saddened at the disclosure, while Senators Francis Escudero and Aquilino Pimentel Jr. also expressed their deepest sympathies. Citizens were shocked because some days before, Aquino had made a public appearance at protests against the Arroyo government. She was known before her confinement to be an avid supporter of NBN-ZTE scandal primary witness Rodolfo Lozada Jr., and actively attended Masses and rallies for him. This included the \\"Mass for Truth and Accountability\\" novena that she helped organise, the first of which began on February 25‚Äìexactly 22 years after her accession as President at the height of the People Power Revolution. On March 23, 2008, during the sixth \\"Mass for Truth and Accountability\\" and the day before Kris' announcement, she was seen attending Easter Sunday Mass in Saint Joseph's College, Quezon City, where she thanked Lozada for \\"his courage and sacrifices for the campaign of truth.\\" On March 25 at approximately 18:00 PHT, Aquino was brought to Makati Medical Center, where she was prepared for chemotherapy. Her son, Benigno III, said that his mother would undergo such unspecified set of procedures before taking chemotherapy. Some sources at the hospital said that the former president would undergo colectomy, cardiopulmonary clearance and blood transfusion as prerequisites for the treatment. Aquino had made some progress in April and her appetite returned. In public remarks made on May 13, 2008, Aquino herself announced that blood tests indicated that she was responding positively to the medical treatment. By July 2009, however, she was reported to be in a very severe condition and kept in hospital due to loss of appetite and chronic baldness. It was announced that Aquino and her family had decided to discontinue the chemotherapy sessions and other medical intervention. Death Aquino died at the Makati Medical Center, at the age of 76 on August 1, 2009 at 03:18 PHT due to cardiorespiratory arrest after complications of colorectal cancer. Her son, Senator Benigno Aquino III, announced her death to the media at 05:00.

Other songs and hymns performed in tribute were \\"Sa 'Yo Lamang\\" (For You Alone) by Piolo Pascual; \\"The Lord's Prayer\\" by Erik Santos; \\"The Impossible Dream\\" by Jed Madela; and \\"Pangako\\" (Promise) by Ogie Alcasid. Martin Nievera and Regine Velasquez performed a duet of \\"The Prayer\\", while Sarah Geronimo sang the People Power Revolution anthem \\"Magkaisa\\" (\\"Unite\\"); \\"Your Heart Today\\" by Filipina singer Maria Teresa Abellare Llamedo Cruzata aka Dulce; \\"Hindi Kita Malilimutan\\" (\\"I Will Never Forget You\\") by Zsa Zsa Padilla; and \\"Bayan Ko\\" (\\"My Country\\") by Lea Salonga. The artists later joined the APO Hiking Society in singing another song from the 1986 People Power Revolution, \\"Handog ng Pilipino sa Mundo\\" (\\"The Gift of Filipinos to the World\\"). The Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra provided musical accompaniment for the service. Aquino's flag-draped casket paused at the steps of Manila Cathedral for departure honours, after which a brass band performed four ruffles and flourishes and the national anthem. It was then mounted onto a flatbed truck ‚Äì similar to the one used for her husband's funeral a quarter century before ‚Äì that was decked in white and yellow flowers arranged in an eight-rayed sunburst evoking the national flag. An honour guard of servicemen from the four branches of the Armed Forces ‚Äì Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Marines ‚Äì stood vigil as the truck-hearse made its way around Plaza Roma fronting the Cathedral, escorted by throngs of mourners. The funeral process then exited Intramuros at Anda Circle and travelled along Roxas Boulevard, with the flag flying from Independence Flagpole at Luneta lowered to half staff in imitation of her husband's own funeral procession. The hearse made its way down Quirino Avenue and the South Luzon Expressway, pausing briefly before the Ninoy Aquino Monument in Makati where crowds sang Bayan Ko and scattered yellow confetti, which was also done during anti-Marcos protests and her 1985 presidential campaign. Aquino's casket arrived at the Manila Memorial Park in Para√±aque, eight hours after leaving the Cathedral. Her immediate family and close associates rode in a caravan of 13 coaches, while mourners and supporters in black and yellow marched beside the hearse and lined the route, chanting her name and flashing the Laban sign (\\"fight\\" made by holding the thumb and forefinger at right angles to form an \\"L\\"). The crowd that lined the funeral route that passed through Manila, Makati, Pasay, and Para√±aque was estimated to be between 1 and 5 people. When the cortege reached Manila Memorial, Aquino was given full military honors, with a two-star general acting as military host and eight, one-star generals as pallbearers. As is customary for a former Commander-in- Chief of the forces, her casket was transferred to a horse-drawn gun carriage for the short trip to the family's mausoleum where her husband Ninoy is interred. Corazon Aquino was buried beside her husband Ninoy at the Manila Memorial Park in Para√±aque, Philippines. Attendance at the burial were originally restricted to Aquino's family and close friends, but the crowd broke through the security barriers after the last of the convoy's coaches entered the gates of Manila Memorial. Though the crowd was inside the memorial park, they maintained a respectful distance from the mausoleum. Bishop Socrates Villegas and Rev Catalino Ar√©valo, SJ gave the final blessing, and as per the family's request, the casket was opened one last time. The plate glass was removed, and after the priests and the Aquino siblings sprinkled the former president's body with holy water, family members queued to give her a parting kiss. The casket was then sealed, the flag was removed, and a final military salute given, with the folded flag presented to Senator Aquino. The pallbearers then pushed the casket into the tomb to the applause of the crowd, after which mourners placed white and yellow flowers inside. As the tomb was being sealed, the congregation sang Bayan Ko again, followed by several Catholic hymns. Aquino's grave marker is in the same style as her husband's: a simple, grey marble plaque with her name, nickname, and the dates of birth and death inscribed in black. Reaction=Domestic= President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who was on a state visit in Washington, D.C. when she was informed about the President Aquino's death, called Aquino a \\"national treasure\\". She cut her trip short to return to Manila for Aquino's wake. Arroyo also announced a 10-day mourning period for the former president, and issued Administrative Order No. 269 authorising \\"official acts and observances‚Äù to help in the funeral. Former President Joseph Estrada said that the country has lost a \\"mother\\" and a \\"guiding voice of the people\\", and described Aquino as \\"Philippines' most loved woman\\". Aquino supported Estrada's removal from office in 2001, but the two supported each other to oppose amendments in the constitution since last year. The Senate has also expressed its grieving with Aquino's death; Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile, who along with Fidel Ramos launched the People Power Revolution, asked the public to pray for her. Minority leader Aquilino Pimentel Jr., who previously served as interior and local government secretary during her administration, had \\"mixed feelings\\" with Aquino's death, saying \\"We shall be forever indebted to Cory for rallying the nation behind the campaign to topple dictatorial rule and restore democracy.\\" An opinion among some Roman Catholics in the country was to push for Aquino's canonisation as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church. =International reaction= President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev in a telegram to President of the Philippines Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo stated, ‚ÄúThe name of Corazon Aquino is associated with a period of profound reforms and the democratic transformation of Filipino society.‚Äù Medvedev also noted that Corazon Aquino showed great interest and sympathy to Russia and prioritised the development of Russian-Filipino relations. International figures expressed their grief, with United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton noting that Aquino was \\"admired by the world for her extraordinary courage\\". White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said that \\"Her courage, determination, and moral leadership serve as an inspiration to us all and exemplify the best in the Filipino nation.\\" Other ambassadors also sent their messages of condolence following her death. Pope Benedict XVI recalled Aquino as a \\"courageous commitment to the freedom of the Filipino people, her firm rejection of violence and intolerance,\\" according to Manila Archbishop Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales. President of South Africa Jacob Zuma called Aquino \\"a great leader who set a shining example of peaceful transition to democracy in her country.\\" Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom said, \\"I am saddened to hear of the death of Corazon 'Cory' Aquino the former President of the Republic of the Philippines.\\" Cory Aquino during a ceremony honoring US Air Force Diplomats from South Africa, Brazil, Turkey, United Kingdom, Iran, Cuba, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Sweden, Thailand, Iraq, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Libya, Mexico, France, and Pakistan, among others, and the representative of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) attended the wake of the former president. *' ‚Äì Brazilian Ambassador Alcides G.R.

Diplomats looked down on the gesture for heads of state given the fact that it was not a state funeral. Ramos-Horta braved a downpour and arrived on Wednesday morning in time for the funeral mass at Manila Cathedral. However, he had to proceed to Manila Memorial Park in Para√±aque ahead of the mourners because he could not sit for long hours due to the wound he sustained from an attempt on his life in East Timor in 2008. *' ‚Äì Ambassador Alistair MacDonald of the delegation of the European Commission to the Philippines led the European Union in expressing grief over the death of Aquino. *' ‚Äì Finnish Ambassador Heikki Hannikainen said that Cory's leadership led to a new era of hope and promise to Filipinos. *' ‚Äì A representative of the territory's Chief Executive Donald Tsang went to the Philippine Consulate to write in the book of condolences. *' ‚Äì President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of the Philippines' nearest neighbour Indonesia said in a statement he was saddened by the news and offered his heartfelt condolences. *' ‚Äì Prime Minister Taro Aso hailed Aquino's contribution to friendly ties between the two countries: *' ‚Äì The wife of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, Wan Azizah, arrived in Manila on the Sunday of the funeral to pay tribute to former Philippine president Corazon Aquino: *' ‚Äì President Dmitry Medvedev in a telegram to Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo stated: ::Medvedev also noted that Corazon Aquino showed great interest and sympathy to Russia and prioritised the development of Russian-Filipino relations. *' ‚Äì Singapore, in a statement from the Foreign Ministry, lauded her as \\"a remarkable woman\\" who worked tirelessly for the betterment of the Philippines. *' ‚Äì Former President Kim Dae-Jung recounted to the Philippine Embassy how the 1986 People Power Revolution that catapulted Aquino to power inspired similar democratic movements worldwide, including his country's own venture into democracy in 1987 following massive rallies. *' ‚Äì Swiss Ambassador Peter Sutter said that Mrs. Aquino conquered the hearts of the Swiss people when she visited Switzerland in June 1988. *' ‚Äì Thailand has sent condolences on the death of former president Aquino who died Saturday after a yearlong battle with colon cancer.

The collections primarily include Fritz Reuter (1810‚Äì1874), who wrote mostly in Low German, and Ida Gr√§fin Hahn-Hahn (1805‚Äì1880), who wrote primarily in High German. During the 19th century these two novelists, with Mecklenburgian roots, were counted among the most widely read authors by the German, as well as the reading public in other countries. Founding The Fritz Reuter Literary Archive came into being during the early 1970s, based on private initiative, and literary interest in Fritz Reuter. Its founder is Hans-Joachim Griephan, journalist and former editor, who originally hails from Mecklenburg. The archive tries to be a gathering and documenting site for Fritz Reuter, his time and his contemporaries. Included as well are authors who influenced Reuter literarily, who see themselves in the tradition of Fritz Reuter, have done research on Fritz Reuter and his time, or have written about Fritz Reuter and his works. Holdings The holdings of the FRLA also include other significant autographs and manuscripts, especially those with ties to Mecklenburg. Beyond those holdings, FRLA includes material by Fritz Reuter and Ida Hahn-Hahn (whole editions of their works, partial editions, translations into foreign languages, essays on their lives, influences, pictures and views pertaining to them, literature of their times, collections of as well as articles from newspapers and magazines).

Starting in January 2011, Wikidot.com began offering a multilingual model on an experimental wiki-basis, by inviting the worldwide community to translate most used commands, help-text and other literals from English to \\"every wished\\" language. After a week, some languages like German, French and Serbian were translated 100% by the community, and Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Finnish, Italian are following now and growing in their completeness. This is now on a site basis and planned for the future is user-based translation so that whoever wants to build a wiki in a special language can do so, even in Klingon. Software and features Originally conceived as a pure wiki, the Wikidot engine today has become more than just a web application framework. It provides page templating, so that the appearance of pages can be changed in one place. It provides page processing (the ListPages module) so that users can create summaries, graphs, lists, and reports. It provides data forms, so that pages can be edited as structured data (and not as a wiki at all). Some of the applications that Wikidot users have recently built are: calendars, chatrooms, issue trackers, blogs, and even MediaWiki emulations. Wikidot.com supports unlimited pages and users. Users can apply SSL encryption, map their wiki to an existing domain (other than wikidot.com), customize privacy settings, assign roles, and interact in wiki-specific forums. A wiki can easily be enriched with content from Flickr, YouTube and other sites by embedding features.Internal Wikis ‚Äì Wikidot.com at www.laptopmag.com Access date: October 11, 2009 Wikidot.com uses a custom wiki engine that has been released as free software under the terms of the Affero General Public License.

It does not have a WYSIWYG editor and the wiki syntax is incompatible with other wiki syntaxes, such as the < and > replaced with \\" and \\". Storage space for free accounts is limited to 300 MB, and free sites still show text advertisements in some cases. Its permissions model is too simple for advanced users. Development of the product goes slowly and a long list of user feature requests is pending. Also, the admin/owner has to decide after the creation of the wiki to which language it will switch the site. This model works fine on a site-basis but not yet on a user-basis. Wikidot community Wikidot expert users have worked together to build large parts of the service. Initially, this was a community site (for supporting new users and discussing solutions), a snippets site (for reusable pieces of code), and a multilingual handbook. At present, there are German, English, Spanish, Italian, French, Turkish, Japanese, Dutch, Polish, Chinese, Indonesian, Romanian and Portuguese Handbooks. Today, the Wikidot user community also makes themes, packages, dashboards, roadmaps, site templates, and reusable applications. In October 2009 Wikidot launched a competition for a new user-designed home page. In many respects Wikidot.com can be considered an \\"open source service\\" as these reusable building blocks are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License. New features can be requested using the Wishlist. Each user has karma, which is an indicator of that user's activity, engagement and experience. The highest karma level indicates that a user is experienced with the Wikidot syntax and is active in the community, and is considered to be a Wikidot Guru, although the system is problematic and may be cheated.  Wikidot interface in other languages  From the very beginning, Wikidot interface was available in English and in Polish. At the beginning of 2011, Wikidot started experimental project \\"Translate Wikidot\\". The project consists in translating Wikidot interface to other languages to make the service more approachable by non- English users, and it is done by Wikidot users on a volunteer basis. The first languages with the finished translation were Serbian French and German, and the translators got one-year free Pro+ accounts as a reward for their efforts. There are also Italian, Finnish, Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc. The project is still ongoing so from time to time, as more features are offered, more text is added, so translators have to visit the Stats page from time to time to check if there is additional text to translate.

The weapon was designed by the Finnish gunsmith Aimo Lahti. 507 weapons were produced in two versions, 7,62 ItKk/31 VKT and an improved 7,62 ItKk/31-40 VKT, between 1933 and 1944. Background In the 1920s Finland was a young state, having just attained independence from Russian Empire. As a result of being part of Russia the vast majority of the armaments of the Finnish army was composed of old Tsarist Russian army equipment, and air defence weapons were few and obsolete. As part of the attempt to improve anti-aircraft armament it was decided to develop purpose-built anti-aircraft machine guns for the army since infantry Maxim machine guns were not adequate for the task. A development plan for 1930-1934 called for 125 heavy 13.2 mm machine guns and 125 7.62 mm machine guns. The task for designing the weapons was given to the gunsmith Aimo Lahti. 7,62 ItKk/31 VKT The prototype of the 7,62 mm anti-aircraft machine gun was finished in 1931 and accepted for use as 7,62 mm kaksoisilmatorjuntakonekiv√§√§ri m 31 or 7,62 ItKk 31 (\\"7.62 mm double anti- aircraft machine gun model 31\\"). 130 weapons were ordered from Valtion Kiv√§√§ritehdas (VKT, the \\"State Rifle Factory\\") in 1933 and first batch of guns was distributed to units on 22 June 1934. A further small batch of 10 guns was produced in 1940, bringing the total to 140. Technically 7,62 ItKk/31 VKT is a Maxim machine gun that has been modified for a higher rate of fire with an accelerator and the use of 250-round disintegrating metallic belts (instead of canvas belts). With these modifications the weapon has a rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute for each gun. The weapon is also air-cooled instead of water-cooled, and has a barrel jacket closely resembling the one in Lahti- Saloranta M/26 light machine gun. At barrel ends are conical flash suppressors. In the twin anti-aircraft machine gun configuration two guns are connected side by side with belt boxes on both sides of the pair and square boxes under both guns for empty shells and belt links. Both guns have cocking handles on the right side and recoil springs on the left; the left hand gun has a modified feed system to allow the belt run from left. Both guns have their own handles which are a mix between a pistol grip and a more usual shovel-handle type used in Maxim machine guns. Each handle has a trigger operated with a forefinger. Support bars protruded from the rear of the weapon that the gunner leaned on to bear the weapon on target. The weapon was used on a 135 cm high cone mount M/31 which, while it worked, was heavy and cumbersome to move. The sight was typical ring sight of the era, with an oval-shaped front sight with two concentric rings while the rear sight was a small peg surrounded by a protective ring. In action the anti-aircraft machine gun had an intended crew of six: commander, gunner, two loaders and two ammunition handlers. Equipment included a transport case for the weapon, spare barrels, locks and springs, toolkit and a wooden transport case for ten spare belt boxes. 7,62 ItKk/31-40 VKT Already in the 1930s it was found that the 7,62 ItKk/31 VKT had some shortcomings. The recoil of the guns tended to cause muzzle climb during shooting, resulting in poor accuracy. During Winter War further problems were found: the mount was heavy and cumbersome, and calibre of the weapon was not powerful enough. This last problem was exacerbated by the fact that the design of a domestic heavy 13.2 mm anti-aircraft machine gun had not proceeded beyond prototype stage; further development of this weapon was stopped soon after. The calibre problem could not be helped, but some of the other problems could be solved and testing of different improvements began already in summer 1939. The most serious problem, the muzzle climb, was solved by modifying the muzzle brake to direct propellant gases only upwards, thus providing a force to counteract the muzzle climb from recoil. However, this unsymmetrical force also necessitated reinforcing the barrels and barrel jackets. Another important improvement was a new sight for the weapon. An additional rectangular bar was fitted between the rear and front sights and the front ring sight was mounted on this bar so that it could be moved back and forth based on the estimated speed of the aircraft. The ring sight was re- designed, with an outer ring for 60¬∞ shooting angle and an inner ring for 30¬∞ angle. The conical mount was replaced with a new tubular tripod mount M/40. The tripod was later further modified to reduce weight. Total modifications are: * Heavier barrel * Heavier barrel jacket with a greater amount of circular cooling openings * Conical muzzle break with openings to direct propellant gases upwards * New sight * Tripod mount On 17 March 1941, 240 weapons were ordered from Valtion Kiv√§√§ritehdas, with a further 82 weapons to be delivered later. However the start of the Continuation War delayed the production, and mass-production did not began in earnest until 1943. A total of 367 weapons were produced, with a majority in 1944. Some guns were not finished in time to take part in the war. Additionally some of the original models were modified for the new standard during repairs. Service history 7,62 ItKk/31 VKT and 7,62 ItKk/31-40 VKT were the most numerous anti-aircraft machine guns used by the Finnish army during World War II. They were used in anti-aircraft machine gun companies and platoons, and later as close defence weapons for anti-aircraft gun batteries. After the war the guns were used in training until the 1960s, and were kept warehoused until 1986, when they were finally declared obsolete. When the guns were removed from inventory there were 467 weapons, of which 41 were in the original 7,62 ItKk/31 VKT configuration. A portion of the guns were given to museums, and rest were scrapped in 1988.

The other two were convicted of ties to armed opposition groups. Iran's former vice president Mohammad Ali Abtahi was sentenced to six years in prison for taking part in the protests. Prisoner abuse Opposition leaders have claimed that the prisoners have been tortured and raped in prison. UN human rights experts, opposition leaders, and world leaders condemned the abuse, which has been compared to Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison. Former Prime Minister and presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi has called the treatment of prisoners on trial \\"medieval torture\\".Torture claim against Iran trial. August 2, 2009 Former chairman of Iranian parliament Mehdi Karroubi has stated that male and female prisoners have been raped in the prison and their genitals torn. In a letter to the head of Assembly of Experts he asked the head of the assembly to investigate abuses. Amnesty International's secretary general has also called for an investigation into allegations of torture and rape in detention.[Independent investigation needed into rape and torture in detention in Iran. August 17, 2009] Iran's police chief, Gen. Ismail Ahmadi Moghaddam, acknowledged that the prisoners had been abused and raped. Ali Larijani, Iran's parliament speaker, has denied that prisoners were abused. In response to denials, several journalists and activists who were detained in the prisons, reported their own personal experience. On August 16, 2009, Fereshteh Ghazi, in an article in Rooz, wrote about her time in prison, describing the torture and sexual violence in Iranian prisons. Additionally, several of the prisoners died while in prison. Authorities claimed that they had \\"pre- existing conditions\\" that led to their deaths, however, examining of the bodies would show signs of torture and broken bones. At least three of the detained protesters have died while in prison at the Kahrizak detention center. One prisoner, 24-year-old Amir Javadifar was clubbed by so badly that he was taken to a hospital and treated before being taken to Evin Prison. He would die while in prison and his father was later called to collect his corpse. Medical reports on his body would show that he had been beaten, had several broken bones and his toenails had been pulled out. Another detainee, Amir Hossein Tufanian, who was in the Kahrizak detention center died while there. After his death, police allegedly demanded that his family pay thousands of dollars for his body. When the family protested that they had no money, they were told they could have it for free if they did not discuss it to anyone. Examinations would show that he had been tortured and had two broken arms. The mysterious death of an Iranian prison doctor on November 10, 2009, continued to raise suspicions. The doctor, Dr. Ramin Pourandarjani, was the only doctor serving at the Kahrizak detention center. He came under scrutiny of the Iranian government when he refused to change the death certificate of Mohsen Rouhalamini, a protester detained at Kahrizakt, to meningitis rather than from torture and beatings. Conflicting reports from Iranian authorities regarding Dr. Pourandarjani's death led to massive outcries from opposition leaders. Many prisoners were raped while detained. In Tehran, at least 37 men and women claim to have been raped by their jailers. Doctors' reports say that two males, aged 17 and 22, died as a result of internal bleeding from being raped. There is some question as to the effectiveness of the confessions to turn public opinion in Iran. One observer has stated that \\"so far,\\" the trials \\"have failed to accrue\\" the \\"fearsome power\\" of the Moscow show trials or earlier public confessions of Iranian secular leftists and MeK guerrillas in 1982, due to broad public support for the prisoners' cause and the \\"subversive\\" power of parodies and criticism of the trials on the Internet.

British Foreign Secretary David Miliband condemned the trial and said that accusing British Embassy staff of stoking the unrest \\"only brings further discredit to the Iranian regime.\\" The Swedish Presidency of the European Union expressed concern over the trial and demanded that the prisoners be released promptly, saying \\"The Presidency reiterates that actions against one EU country ‚Äî citizen or embassy staff ‚Äî is considered an action against all of EU, and will be treated accordingly.\\"Presidency statement on the post-election trial in Tehran Swedish Presidency of the EU ‚Äì August 8, 2009.

He served as Inspekteur des Heeres (Inspector of the Army) 1979‚Äì81.obituary of the Clausewitz-Gesellschaft  Early life  Poeppel was born in Schivelbein, Farther Pomerania (today ≈öwidwin, Poland) and passed his Abitur at a Napola institution in Berlin in 1939.Wirtschaftswoche.de \\"Gelobt sei was hart macht\\" 20 May 2009 Career=Wehrmacht= That year he passed his Abitur, Poeppel joined the Wehrmacht as an officer cadet and served in the Artillerieregiment 32 throughout the Second World War. In 1941 while serving in Serbia, he ordered the massacres of Serbian Jews. By the end of the war, he had attained the rank of Hauptmann (captain), and managed to avoid Soviet captivity.Biography at deutschesheer.de =Post-war= In 1947‚Äì49, he studied at the Pedagogic Institute in Celle, including a semester at the University of Manchester. He started to work as a teacher in 1949 in Wriedel (Uelzen) and became an academic assistant at the Pedagogic University of Osnabr√ºck in 1952. =Bundeswehr= After the founding and organization of the Bundeswehr in 1955, Poeppel volunteered and was reinstated at his former rank of captain. Poeppel passed his general staff training at the F√ºhrungsakademie der Bundeswehr in 1958‚Äì61 and served on the Staff of the I. Korps in M√ºnster. He became Staff Officer to the Generalinspekteure Friedrich Foertsch and Heinrich Trettner and commanded the Feldartilleriebataillon 31 in L√ºneburg. In 1967‚Äì69, he worked at the Federal Ministry of Defense in Bonn. Within the Bundeswehr, Poeppel was known as an advocate of the \\"traditionalist\\" school, which saw the Bundeswehr as a continuation of the Wehrmacht, the Reichswehr, the Royal Prussian Army and ultimately could trace its descent all the way back to the army founded by the Great Elector of Brandenburg in 1640. Against the \\"traditionalist\\" school with its emphasis on the continuity of Prussian-German military history, there were the \\"reformers\\" who argued that the Bundeswehr was a new force unconnected to the past and who placed an emphasis on the discontinuity between the Reich that had existed between 1871-1945 and the new Federal Republic founded in 1949. As such, the \\"reformers\\" argued that the Bundeswehr should not be venerating men such as Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and Admiral G√ºnther L√ºtjens as heroes. Poeppel argued in a memo because the Defense Minister Theodor Blank had stated the intellectual role models for the Bundeswehr were to be Carl von Clausewitz, August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, and Gerhard von Scharnhorst, that in his view that the Bundeswehr was a continuation of the old Prussian Army, and as such figures from the past like Hindenburg and L√ºtjens were to be venerated in the new Bundeswehr. Poeppel (r.) at his retirement next to President Karl Carstens in 1981 On 1 January 1970, Poeppel became the commander of Panzergrenadierbrigade 1 in Hildesheim until 31 March 1973 and until 31 March 1978 of the 6. Panzergrenadierdivision in Neum√ºnster. There he was promoted to Generalmajor. On 1 April 1978 Poeppel returned to Bonn and became the Deputy Inspector of the Army and a year later Inspector (Inspekteur de sHeeres). Poeppel retired on 1 October 1981. In 1983, the American historian Christopher Browning in an article published in Milit√§rgeschichtiche Mitteiblugen entitled \\"Wehrmacht Reprisal Policy and the Mass Murder of Jews in Serbia\\" accused Poeppel of being involved in the massacres of Serbian Jews in 1941. Poeppel was never prosecuted because German law maintained a distinction between murder and being accomplice to murder-the latter defined as killing someone while obeying orders in the service of the state. Only those who killed on their own initiative in the National Socialist era were considered to have committed murder in the legal sense. In 1968, the Bundstag passed a law that retroactively declared the statute of limitations for being an accomplice to murder as expiring within 15 years of the crime. In 1969, it was estimated that because of the new statute of limitations for crime of accomplice to murder that 90% of those Germans suspected of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the National Socialist era now enjoyed legal immunity as these people could argue that they had only committed their crimes while obeying orders. As the massacres that Poeppel had ordered took place in 1941 and all of the evidence indicated that he was merely obeying the orders of his superiors, the statute of limitations for these crimes expired in 1956 and as such he enjoyed legal immunity. Personal life Poeppel was married in 1947 to Edelgard, \\"the girl next door\\" to him in Pomerania, and the couple had two children. Their son, Burkhardt, also became a Bundeswehr officer; their daughter, Susanne studied for an advanced degree at the P√§dagogische Hochschule in Bonn. Poeppel was an able and ardent tennis player all his life.

Coe was born in Waupun, Wisconsin, to Samuel Buel Coe and his wife Mary Jane (n√©e Cronkhite). After his education and training, Coe went on to become a pioneer doctor in the Dakota Territory, a member of the territorial legislature, and close friend of Theodore Roosevelt. Biography When he was very young Coe and his parents moved to Morristown, Minnesota. After graduating from high school, Coe took classes at the University of Minnesota. He supplemented his studies under the tutelage of his father, also a physician, and attending classes at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. He graduated from Long Island College Hospital in New York in July 1880. He moved to Mandan, North Dakota and was among the first physicians to settle in the Dakota Territory.

While in the Dakota Territory, Coe met the young Theodore Roosevelt, who had gone there to regain his health. Their friendship lasted until Roosevelt's death in 1919. He and his wife Viola (Boley) Coe, also a physician, moved to Portland, Oregon in 1890 where they focused on treating nervous and mental diseases, and where he owned and operated the Morningside Hospital.

After retiring from practice in 1920, Henry and his second wife traveled extensively in Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America. He died after a heart attack in Glendale, California. Statues=Oregon= Coe commissioned and donated four statues to the city of Portland in the 1920s. The Alexander Phimister Proctor statue of Theodore Roosevelt, is in the South Park Blocks. Coe knew Roosevelt in 1884-1886 and went on hunting trips with him. Coe paid $40,000 for the statue. The equestrian statue of Joan of Arc, in Laurelhurst, Portland, Oregon, was made from the original molds of Emmanuel Fr√©miet's statue at the Place des Pyramides, which Coe saw on a visit to France. Portland's Arc statue arrived from France in 1924 and was dedicated on Memorial Day, May 30, 1925, honoring the Doughboys of World War I. Two additional statues were in progress but were erected after Coe's death in 1927. One is the statue of Abraham Lincoln by George Fife Waters, commissioned in 1926 and dedicated at its South Park Blocks location on October 5, 1928.

Life He was born at Worcester about 1620, a younger son of Richard Hall, clothier, of Worcester, by his wife, Elizabeth (Bonner), and was apparently educated at the King's School, Worcester; Thomas Hall was his eldest brother. In 1636 he entered Pembroke College, Oxford, but left the university without a degree to take up arms for the parliament against Charles I. He took the Solemn League and Covenant, and became a captain in the parliamentary army. About 1647 he returned to Oxford, and was made a fellow of Pembroke College, proceeding Master of Arts (Oxford) (MA Oxon) on 11 March 1650. He was strongly in favour of monarchy, and wrote bitterly against Cromwell's pretensions with. About 1651 he was committed to prison by the council of state, and remained there for twelve months, still attacking the government in pamphlets. Subsequently he preached in Oxford and the neighbourhood, and about 1657 became chaplain to Edmund Bray, of Great Risington, Gloucestershire. Bray was a royalist, and tried unsuccessfully to present Hall to the rectory of Great Risington, of which he was patron. His views, although Calvinistic, grew into something like conformity with the Church of England, and at the Restoration he made professions of loyalty. In May 1661 he petitioned the government to remove Lewis Atterbury from the rectory of Great Risington, to which Bray had presented him, without effect. He secured, however, preferment at Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, where he was generally popular and taken serious by some but not all. In 1680 he finally became rector of Great Risington on the presentation of Bray. He died in August 1687, and was buried (5 August) in the chancel of his church. On moving to Great Risington he had married. Works Hall was author of '·º© Œ±œÄŒøœÉœÑŒ±œÉŒØŒ± ·ΩÅ Œ±ŒΩœÑŒØœáœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÇ, ... A scriptural Discourse of the Apostacy and the Antichrist, by E.

According to Anthony Wood, he was the anonymous author of 'Lazarus's Sores lick'd' (London, 1650), an attack on Lazarus Seaman, who had recommended submission to Cromwell and the army. Two anonymous pamphlets, entitled respectively 'Lingua Testium, wherein Monarchy is proved to be Jure Divino,' &c.; (Lond.

Ferrara, Weller and others involved have expressed unhappiness with the released version, particularly with the added omniscient narration. (Weller refused to provide this narration, so producers Peter Davis and William Panzer hired actor Reni Santoni instead). Plot George Moran is a former American paratrooper and veteran of the Dominican Republic intervention who now runs a small beachfront motel in Miami. While searching for a Dominican woman named Luci Palma who saved his life in 1965 (and gave him the nickname \\"Cat Chaser\\"), he begins a relationship with Mary DeBoya, the wealthy, unhappy wife of a sadistic former Dominican general. Moran gets involved in a plot by fellow military veteran Nolen Tyner and a former New York policeman, Jiggs Scully, to rip off the general. Moran must elude a number of double-crosses as he and Mary attempt to gain her freedom plus $2 million of the general's money.

She said in 2001: \\"It was the most hateful experience of my life, and I said, if this is what acting is going to be, I will not do it. On the last day of shooting, I said to Abel 'Are you done with me?' He sai, 'Yeah.' I walked in my trailer and shaved my head.

He was a bay stallion bred by Donald Beaton of Levedale, Gloucester, New South Wales. This son of the outstanding campdrafter, Cecil (1899, by Red Gauntlet from Meretha II) from Black Bess by Hukatere (1882) was foaled on 11 November 1918. Beaton took great care in the breeding of his horses requiring horses with ability and stamina, for which he culled heavily. Radium‚Äôs sire, Cecil was so successful that in 1913, his owner, Arch Simpson was asked to leave his champion campdrafter at home in order that other competitors had a chance to win the campdrafting event at Geary‚Äôs Flat Bushman‚Äôs Carnival. Radium was broken in by Archie Grant and Billy Tout when he was a two-year-old, after which he had several trips to the Cooplacurripa area. He began to show his exceptional ability as a stock horse as he developed and matured. Donald Beaton often drove long distances to compete at bushman‚Äôs carnivals with Radium tied behind the buggy. Radium would then compete in the campdraft, often winning and if he was going well, round off his success with an exhibition of campdrafting without a bridle. Starr, Joan. The Horse that Calls Australia Home, Equine Educational, 1996, In circa 1928, Radium was sold to Herb O‚ÄôNeil, who, as a friend of Donald Beaton, had ridden the horse in competitions for Beaton when he had been unable to get away from his property. Herb O‚ÄôNeill competed extensively with Radium, winning over a large area of the state. Just prior to the Second World War (WWII), Radium won a Championship Campdraft at Kempsey, New South Wales with the next ten placings going to Radium‚Äôs sons and daughters. Radium was also highly successful in led contests for the best type of Stock Horse. During WWII, at a Dungog Bushman‚Äôs Carnival over 20 horses were competing in the led stock horse class. In this event Radium received the first placing with the remaining four all being his sons.Gower, Peter.

Quite a few horses had a double cross or were line-bred to this great foundation sire.Guy Fawkes Horses Retrieved on 2009-8-1 His son, Chan was one of the smartest horses seen in a cattle camp and was a good sire. Another son, Dimray foaled in 1938 was a brilliant campdrafter and when retired to stud, he carried on the Radium tradition of producing top stock horses and campdrafters. It was as a sire that Dimray had a tremendous influence with his son Reality, his grandson Rivoli Ray and his great grandson, Cecil Bruce being Hall of Fame inductees. Radium died on 12 November 1947, at 29 years of age, of a genital malignancy. This was the end of the life of a truly great horse, but he was also the foundation of a great line of horses.

The opening of the halt was part of an attempt by the Great Western Railway to encourage more passengers on the line at a time when competition from bus services was drawing away patronage. The possibility of reopening the line through Towersey Halt, which is now part of a long-distance footpath, has been explored by Chiltern Railways, the franchise holder for the Chiltern Main Line which runs through . History Parliamentary authorisation for the extension of the Wycombe Railway's single track line beyond to was given on 28 June 1861.Oppitz, 2000, pages 16-17 was reached by 31 July 1862, and a regular service from via began the next day.Potts, 2004, page 45 By 1933, passenger numbers were dropping as a result of increased bus competition which led the Great Western Railway to introduce railmotors as an economy measure between Princes Risborough and Thame.Oppitz, 2000, page 18 A wooden halt was also opened to the south of the small village of Towersey on the up side of an embankment on the western side of a level crossing spanning the Thame - Towersey - Chinnor road.Simpson, 2001, page 85 No more than long, the halt was supervised by the station master at Thame.Potts, 2004, page 110 As with similar GWR structures, Towersey Halt had very basic facilities: a small wooden pagoda-style passenger waiting shelter, two oil lamps and a running in board showing the station's name on both sides.Mitchell and Smith, 2003, plates 64 and 65 To the east of the halt, Penn Farm had its own siding from the line's opening until 1939.Mitchell and Smith, 2003, plate XVI On the basis of an estimated saving of ¬£34,372, passenger services were withdrawn between Oxford and Princes Risborough from January 1963. However, the track remained in use down to handle oil trains serving the BP depot at Thame. The depot finally closed in October 1991 and the track was dismantled.  Present day  Nothing remains of the halt, but the trackbed running through it has been incorporated into the Phoenix Trail, a long-distance footpath and cycleway. As part of its preparations for its bid to run the Chiltern Railways franchise, Chiltern Railways announced in 2000 that it was looking into the possibility of reinstating passenger services on the line between Oxford and Risborough, the cost of which it estimated at ¬£250m.Oxford Mail, \\"New rail links on the cards\\", 16 August 2000.

A key member of Carlton's defense in a successful era, Jamieson played in 14 finals with Carlton. He was used initially as a wingman following his recruitment from Williamstown, from which he played the 1910 Grand Final, but found a home at full-back when he performed well in that position late in the 1911 season. Jamieson, renowned for his skills when kicking in after a behind, was a VFL representative in 1913. A full-back in the 1914 and 1915 Carlton premiership teams, Jamieson was a hero in the former when he punched the ball away from South Melbourne forward Tom Bollard in the goal square, preventing a last second goal which would have levelled the scores. He broke his arm in the 1916 Preliminary Final and as a result missed the premiership decider that year. The defender had surgery but suffered complications which kept him out of action for four seasons. Despite being 33, Jamieson made a return to VFL football in 1921 and participated in his fourth and final Grand Final, a narrow loss to Richmond. At the start of the 1922 season Jamieson was appointed captain of Carlton, but due to injury had to resign partway through the year.http://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/119688 VFL Record Round 1 1922 page 28http://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/119680 VFL Record Round 11 1922 page 9 After football, he was the proprietor of The Clare Castle Hotel in Rathdowne street, Carlton until 1936.

In her book on Eva Bonnier and Hanna Hirsch/Pauli (1999), Margareta Gynning uses the form Hirsch-Pauli throughout. (Stockholm, 13 January 1864 ‚Äì 29 December 1940, Solna), was a Swedish painter; primarily of genre scenes and portraits. Life Hanna Hirsch was a daughter of music publisher Abraham Hirsch. She was a friend of Eva Bonnier, and they followed each other through the painting school of August Malmstr√∂m, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm. Hanna Hirsch studied in Paris from 1885 until 1887 at the Acad√©mie Colarossi, and shared a studio with Bonnier for part of that time. While working in Paris, she formed a number of close friendships with other women artists from the Nordic countries. She had her portrait of the Finnish artist Venny Soldan (now in the Gothenburg Art Museum) accepted to the Paris Salon in 1887. The portrait is realistic and unconventional for its time in portraying a female artist at work (sitting on the floor with clay in her hands) rather than in proper bourgeois attire. The casual informality of Soldan's expression and pose were \\"interpreted as reflecting the liberated lifestyle of Nordic women in Paris at the time\\"Hansen, exh. cat. p.76-77 and the portrait was also considered indecent and denounced as bohemian. Pauli described the portrait: \\"We had no major debts at the time. The studio was extremely cold and damp; my Finnish friend had to sit wearing a muff when I painted her. In the bedroom the damp ran down the walls, and there was only a small skylight in the roof. The material side of life troubled us very little at all ‚Ä¶ Moreover, my friend and I almost always plodded around in slippers; it saved so on shoe-leather and it was so very comfortable.\\"Gothenburg Museum Catalogue Entry Pauli received a third class medal for her work at the Exposition Universelle (1889) in Paris. She exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. As was the case with most other Swedish artists of her generation, her painting stood closer to the French juste milieu painters than to most impressionists; nevertheless, the thickly applied paint she used to show specks of light on the white tablecloth on her 1887 painting Frukostdags (Breakfast Time) (in Nationalmuseum, Stockholm) provoked one critic to comment that she had probably used the cloth to clean her brushes. In 1887 she married the painter Georg Pauli and travelled with him to Italy for a year. Her lifetime production was sparse and mostly consisting of portraits, painting artists and writers from her and her husband's circle of friends, such as the one of painter Karl Nordstr√∂m (1890; in the Bonnier portrait collection, Nedre Manilla, Stockholm), writer Verner von Heidenstam as Hans Alienus (one of his literary characters, 1896), writer Selma Lagerl√∂f (1932, Nationalmuseum) and the group portrait V√§nner (Friends, 1907, Nationalmuseum) showing writer Ellen Key reading to a group in the home of the Pauli family.

The Council established two principles: * that the organization would be the advocate for problem gamblers and their families * that it would maintain a neutral stance regarding the activity of gambling The National Council's mission is to lead state and national stakeholders in the development of comprehensive policy and programs for all those affected by problem gambling with the purpose of serving as the national advocate for programs and services to assist problem gamblers and their families. It is neither for nor against legalized gambling. The NCPG concentrates efforts on the national level, while the state affiliates work at the state and local level. NCPG's network of state affiliate, individual and corporate members includes leaders in prevention, education, treatment, enforcement, research, responsible gaming and recovery communities. Keith Whyte became the Executive Director of the NCPG in October 1998. He oversees NCPG operations, with a specific focus on legislative advocacy, media relations, research, and public policy. Previously, he served as Director of Research for The American Gaming Association. NCPG programs A large portion of the NCPG funding comes from its membership program. NCPG membership is organized with 3 classes of members: state affiliate, corporate and individual. The NCPG's major programs include the following: * National Problem Gambling Helpline (1-800-522-4700): ensures local problem gambling help is just one call away anywhere in the US. * National Referral Resource: NCPG maintains the only nationwide online directories of certified counselors and inpatient/residential treatment facilities that offer specialized help in problem gambling, plus state-by- state referral resource listings. * Problem Gambling Awareness Month: An annual grassroots campaign in March aiming to raise awareness about problem gambling and to educate the public and healthcare professionals about the availability of help and hope. In 2018, over 200 organizations participated in encouraging stakeholders to ‚ÄúHave the Conversation‚Äù about problem gambling and explore the many meanings of this theme by providing free press releases, screening tools, logo files, wearable messaging and other resources. * National Conference on Problem Gambling: The oldest and largest annual conference of its kind. Approximately 500 regulators, legislators, counselors, researchers, industry executives and recovering gamblers attend each year. Specific in-depth training is provided for all aspects of the field and top researchers present their latest findings. Up to 30 hours of Continuing Education Units may be earned over the 2-day Pre-Conference Workshops and 2-day Main Conference. The location changes each year, hosted by a state Affiliate and offering each region of the country easy access on a rotating basis. * Lottery Holiday Responsible Gaming Campaign: Created in partnership with the International Centre for Youth Gambling Problems and High-Risk Behaviors at McGill University, this campaign encourages adults to be aware of the risks of giving lottery products to minors as holiday gifts because those who start gambling at a young age are more likely to develop a problem later in life. NCPG partners with lottery organizations, providing free resources such as press release samples, social media guidelines and advertising materials, to launch their own independent campaigns. In 2017, 54 U.S. and international lotteries participated in the Campaign. Endorsed by the World Lottery Association (WLA). * NASPL/NCPG Responsible Gambling Verification Program (RGV): In partnership with the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, RGV is an independent review of lottery efforts to plan, implement and sustain their programs in RG in accordance with NCPG standards. Free to NASPL members. * Internet Compliance Assessment Program (iCAP): Independent reviewers assess an internet gambling site's compliance with NCPG's Internet Responsible Gaming Standards, the first such standards developed for the U.S. market. * Responsible Gaming Principles for Sports Gambling Legislation: Provides a basis for new regulations and legislation that may be enacted by individual states to allow sports betting. The principles will help protect individuals, gaming companies, and legislators by assisting the creation of reasonable efforts to prevent harm and provide treatment. * Risk Education for Athletes Program (REAP): educates athletes of all ages about the personal and professional risks involved with gambling and how to be smart in risky situations.

Contner. The movie is a part of the Moment of Truth franchise and deals with the danger of anorexia nervosa among teens.Review summary The New York Times Plot Lexi Archer is a teenager who, after the divorce of her parents, moves with her mother Kathryn and younger sister Jill from Chicago to Seattle. At her new school, she befriends Jennifer Harnsberger, a popular straight A student whom she meets during volleyball tryouts. After her volleyball coach suggests that Lexi should lose a few pounds in order to enhance her athletic performance, she starts to look for ways to diet. When Jennifer admits to being bulimic, they decide to diet and work out together. Kathryn notices that her daughter is eating less and becoming thinner, but she is too occupied with her divorce to realize there is a problem. Lexi becomes adept at hiding the true nature of her eating habits. Meanwhile, Lexi and Jill visit their father in Chicago and try to convince him to reunite with Kathryn, but they soon discover that he is dating a new woman, Jolene. Kathryn begins to suspect an eating disorder when she finds out that Lexi has not had her period in over three months. She consults a gynaecologist, but she tells her that Lexi is at a normal weight. She attributes Lexi's weight loss to the trauma of the divorce. Lexi appeared to weigh more at the doctor's because she clandestinely placed eight bundles of coins on her body to make her appear to be heavier. Meanwhile, she and Jennifer consider being models. They are excited to be contacted by Nick McKay, a photographer, but he is interested only in Jennifer and explains that Lexi is not fit to be a model. Upset, she starts to diet even more and she eventually collapses during a volleyball match. She is hospitalized, diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and is forced to enter a recovery program. Her parents have different opinions about her treatment and start to argue. Nevertheless, she eventually recovers and is released. She admits to her mother that Jennifer has an eating disorder as well, and a worried Kathryn immediately informs Jennifer's mother. Although Pamela dismisses the possibility of her daughter having such a condition, Jennifer feels betrayed when she hears about it and refuses to speak to Lexi, for which she blames her mother. Lexi tries to confront her at a party, but a drunken Jennifer angrily leaves, only to be hit by a car. She is taken to a hospital and dies of a cardiac arrest. Lexi has trouble dealing with her friend's death and relapses with her eating disorder. Devastated, her mother tries to help her, assuring her that Jennifer's death can't be blamed on her. Her father wants her to be hospitalized again, but Kathryn insists she can help Lexi herself. He is successful in getting a court order to hospitalize her, but Lexi is in the end able to recover on her own, encouraged by her mother. The film ends as Lexi participates in a volleyball match, where she sees Jen's spirit who smiles at her, and she wins the match.

It was part of Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred it to Oxfordshire. The village is between Oxford and Faringdon, southwest of Oxford. The parish includes the hamlet of Duxford. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 328. Manor In 1086 the Domesday Book recorded the village as Hentone, Old English for \\"high farmstead\\". In the 12th century the manor passed to the St. Valery family, from whom the village took the second part of its name. In 1332 the manor was acquired by William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton, whose granddaughter Mary de Bohun became the first wife of Henry IV. The manor was subsequently held by John Ramsay, 1st Earl of Holderness, Sir Henry Marten and the Loder family. The oldest part of Hinton Manor House is a late 16th-century Elizabethan building. About 1700 John Loder had it refronted and a new block added to the rear. Additions to the house, including an orangery and a Gothic revival-style wing, were built about 1830. An extra storey was added to one wing about 1860. The house is a Grade II* listed building. Castle The earthworks of a former 11th century motte-and- bailey castle are southwest of the moated manor house. Parish church The Church of England parish church of St Margaret is mid-13th-century. It is cruciform, completed in the late 13th century by the addition of the south transept. Several of the windows and their stained glass are 19th-century. Inside the church are several monuments to members of the Loder family, and one dedicated to the memory of Airey Neave, who lived in the village and has his grave in the churchyard. The church is a Grade II* listed building. The west tower is Decorated Gothic and has a ring of six bells. Abraham I Rudhall of Gloucester cast the second, third and fourth bells in 1709. William Taylor of Loughborough cast the fifth bell in 1843, presumably at the foundry he had at that time in Oxford. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the tenor bell in 1868. John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast the treble bell in 1928. St Margaret's parish is part of the Benefice of Cherbury with Gainfield. The oldest part of the Old Rectory is the rear wing, which is 14th- century. It has three crucks and was built as a hall house. The central part of the house was added in the 17th century, and the front was added about 1840. It is a Grade II* listed building. It is no longer a clergy residence. Former parish school in Hinton Waldrist School The parish school was built in 1850. By 1924 it was an elementary school. It has since been closed and the building converted into a private house.  Amenities  There is a farm shop at Laggots Farm on the High Street selling locally produced vegetables, eggs and meat.

On 4 May 1941, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, ordered General Sir Archibald Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) Middle East Command, to create this force.Lyman, p. 16 RAF Habbaniya was a Royal Air Force station at Habbaniya in the Kingdom of Iraq. From 30 April, the small British garrison at Habbaniya had been under siege by strong Iraqi forces loyal to Rashid Ali. On 1 April, Rashid Ali and his anti-British supporters had staged a coup against the pro-British government of Regent Amir Abdul Illah and relations between the British and the government of Rashid Ali quickly deteriorated until, on 2 May, the British made air attacks throughout Iraq.

The next objective was Kilo 25, a point on the Baghdad road about west of Ramadi. On the advice of Colonel Ouvry Roberts in Habbaniya, the column was to turn south-east at Kilo 25 to avoid a confrontation with an Iraqi brigade thought to be at Ramadi. The column would then skirt Lake Habbaniya and advance on Habbaniya by crossing a new bridge at the village of Mujara. The village had been taken on 10 May and a bridge over the water regulator there was completed by 16 May.

On 16 May, the column reached Kilo 25 and turned off the main road and headed south- east in accordance with Roberts' suggestion. Disaster then struck when numerous vehicles driven by inexperienced drivers sank up to the axles in soft sand. The whole column halted while vehicles were dug out one by one. On 17 May, three Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters attacked an extended column of Kingcol in the desert. Luckily for the British, the fighters had not attacked the previous day when many vehicles were immobilized by the soft sand.Lyman, p. 60 On 18 May, Kingcol arrived in Habbaniya, where elements joined the other elements of Iraqforce in the advance on Fallujah.Lyman, p.19 On 19 May, the Iraqis in Fallujah surrendered. On 22 May, the British forces in Fallujah repulsed an Iraqi counter-attack to re-take the city. On 25 May, the main body of Habforce reached Habbaniya and joined the advance on Baghdad.

Taxonomy Leopardwood was first formally described in 1848 by John Lindley in Thomas Mitchell's Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia. In 1963, George Bentham changed the name to Flindersia maculosa in Flora Australiensis. Distribution and habitat Flindersia maculosa grows on stony hills and sand plains from Hughenden in central Queensland to the Riverina district in south- western New South Wales and from Walgett to Ivanhoe and Broken Hill in that state. Uses Leopardwood is a useful fodder tree in drought periods but as the tree does not recuperate well, it should only be pollarded. The wood of the tree is sometimes used to construct fence posts and pick handles. Nectar from the buds, and gum from the bark has been used to make a sweet drink. The drink from the gum has been used as a remedy for diarrhea. Ecology Larvae of the moth Opodiphthera astrophela feed on the leopardwood tree. An unidentified beetle in the genus Anilara can cause serious damage to the leopardwood tree. The mistletoe Amyema lucasii grows almost exclusively on the F. maculosa. Conservation status Flindersia maculosa is classified as of \\"least concern\\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. =Gallery= Image:Flindersia maculosa00.jpgdrawing by Margaret Flockton Image:Mutawintji4 - Eagle Nest.JPGA wedge-tailed eagle's nest in a fruiting leopardwood tree at Mutawintji National Park Image:Flindersia maculosa Mt Oxley.JPGthumbBark References maculosa Sapindales of Australia Flora of New South Wales Flora of Queensland Trees of Australia Plants described in 1848 Taxa named by John Lindley ","title":"Flindersia maculosa"},{"id":"23822535","text":"Kuarup is a 1989 Brazilian drama film directed by Ruy Guerra.

A glaciated lake filled with liquid peat and moss flooded pit workings trapping more than a hundred miners underground. For several days rescue teams worked non-stop to reach the trapped men. Most were eventually rescued three days later, but 13 died. The disaster was an international media event. Background Knockshinnoch Castle Colliery, which was situated at New Cumnock, was managed by New Cumnock Collieries Ltd. Its shaft was sunk in 1942 on the site of an older pit that had been abandoned almost 60 years earlier. The pit brought prosperity back to a local mining community that had been in decline. The new pit attracted many miners from Lanarkshire. The pit's owners employed a policy of advanced mechanisation making the ‚ÄòCastle‚Äô one of the best equipped and most productive collieries in the Ayrshire coalfield. At the time of the disaster, Knockshinnoch employed approximately 700 men. Coal production was in the region of 4.5‚Äì5000 tons per week. It was mostly extracted from two seams known locally as the ‚ÄòMain Coal‚Äô and the ‚ÄòTurf Coal‚Äô. In 1947 the mine had been taken over by National Coal Board (NCB), Scottish Division. The NCB continued to invest in modern mechanised techniques at the pit. The colliery also boasted a great welfare programme for its employees including a new canteen and pithead baths (which had opened during the first week of September 1950). Collapse On Thursday, 7 September 1950 at approximately 7.30 pm ‚Äì during the afternoon shift ‚Äì a large volume of liquefied peat or moss broke down into the No. 5 Heading section of the 'Main coal' seam in the South Boig district of the mine. The liquid matter had come from a glaciated lake just below the surface. The inrush occurred at the point where the No. 5 Heading (or Drift) was being driven towards the surface at a gradient of 1 in 2. The inrush of liquid rushed back down the incline filling miles of underground workings and sealing off all escape routes to the surface. 135 men were underground at the time. Six working close to the pit bottom managed to escape before they were sealed in by the sludge. Another 116 miners found themselves cut off from the pit bottom. However, a further 13 men were unaccounted for. As the men remained trapped underground, rescue teams began to try and reach them before they were engulfed by the encroaching sludge or they were overcome by the rapidly deteriorating air quality and gas. A telephone line to the surface remained intact, allowing the trapped miners to provide details of their location to their rescuers. British Pathe News described this as \\"a truly remarkable story of how ordinary men worked tirelessly in a race against time and the forces of nature to achieve one of the most dramatic and remarkable rescues ever attempted.\\" After three days, the men were eventually rescued by being led through the old disused gas-filled Bank No. 6 mine workings which ran close to Knockshinnoch. A total of 87 sets of Siebe Gorman Salvus oxygen rebreathers (mainly from fire stations) were used to get the men out. The 13 men trapped close to No. 5 Heading could not be reached. Their bodies were recovered months later. Legacy In 1952, the film The Brave Don't Cry was made about the disaster.

Overview The club began meeting informally at the Albion House in Boston.Mellow, James R. Nathaniel Hawthorne in His Times. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980: 539. Publishing agent and lawyer Horatio Woodman first suggested the gatherings among his friends for food and conversation.Gale, Robert L. A Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Companion. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2003: 210. By 1856, the organization became more structured with a loose set of rules, with monthly meetings held over dinner at the Parker House. The Parker House served as their place of meeting for many years. It was a hotel built in 1854 by Harvey D. Parker.Whitehill, Walter Muir. \\"Review of The Saturday Club: A Century Completed 1920-1956\\" by Edward W. Forbes and John H.

The New England Quarterly, Vol. 1, No. 2 (Apr., 1928), p. 267. The gatherings led to the creation of the Atlantic Monthly, to which many of the members contributed. The name was suggested by early member Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.Broaddus, Dorothy C. Genteel Rhetoric: Writing High Culture in Nineteenth-Century Boston. Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina, 1999: 46.. The original members of the group included Woodman, Louis Agassiz, Richard Henry Dana Jr., and James Russell Lowell. In the following years, membership was extended to Holmes, Cornelius Conway Felton, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and William Hickling Prescott.Gale, Robert L. A Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Companion. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2003: 210‚Äì211. Other members included Ralph Waldo Emerson, Asa Gray, John Lothrop Motley, Benjamin Peirce, Charles Sumner, John Greenleaf Whittier, and others. Invitations to the group were considered a sort of affirmation of acceptance into Boston's high society. Ohio-native William Dean Howells was invited by James Russell Lowell in 1860 and recalled in a memoir that it seemed like a rite of passage. Holmes joked that Howells's presence serve as \\"something like the apostolic succession... the laying on of hands\\". A few years later, Howells was named editor of the Atlantic Monthly, which published many of the works by members of the group.O'Connell, Shaun. Boston: Voices and Visions. Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 2010: 92. In 1884, Oliver Wendell Holmes published a poem titled \\"At the Saturday Club\\" in which he reminisced about the gatherings. By then, many of its members were dead. Ralph Waldo Emerson's son, Edward Waldo Emerson, published two books about the Saturday Club and its members in the early 20th century. A version of the Saturday Club still exists in Boston.

Life Altoona (c. 1870s) Frank Thomson was born in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania on July 5, 1841. At age 17, Thomson became an apprentice in the PRR machine shops in Altoona, and studied mechanical engineering there for four years. Thomson gained experience with restoring shops, repair of rolling stock and machinery, the rebuilding of bridges and the construction of new roads and telegraph lines. Later in his life, the press often commented he could both build a locomotive and act as its engineer. He enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 during the American Civil War, and served as chief assistant to Colonel Thomas A. Scott, later the PRR's fourth president. As assistant to Scott, Thomson built railroads and bridges as well as directed the transport of troops and supplies. Thomson was relieved of military duty in June 1864, and appointed Superintendent of the Eastern Division of the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad. He served in this position until 1873, when he was appointed Superintendent of Motive Power of the PRR at Altoona, and in 1874, General Manager of the PRR system east of Pittsburgh and Erie. Under Thomson's management, the railroad saw equipment of a superior quality become the standard, as well as the building of picturesque stations. He became a PRR vice-president in 1882, and was promoted to be the sixth president in 1897. Thomson instituted a system of track inspection, and was said to be instrumental in standardizing track and roadbed. Thomson had a daughter, Anne, and two sons, Frank G. and Clarke. He was also an avid outdoorsman, and struck up a friendship with William F. Cody, otherwise known as Buffalo Bill, who took him buffalo hunting. Thomson hosted scores of distinguished European and American visitors at his hunting cabin at Corkerhill. He also served as director of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. He died on June 5, 1899, in Merion, Pennsylvania after a two-week illness. Legacy Following his death, his children established the Frank Thomson Scholarship as a memorial to their father. Thomson had a lifelong interest in the education of the youth of his fellow employees, and he devoted himself to helping them obtain an education. Today, the Scholarship are offered annually to provide assistance toward tuition and additional necessary expenses for undergraduate study at generally recognized and accepted colleges and universities.

When the diplomatic mission of Alexander Troyanovsky was completed, Umansky acted as charg√© d'affaires of the embassy, when on 11 May 1939, Umansky was appointed by Joseph Stalin as Ambassador of the Soviet Union to the United States and he presented his Letters of Credence to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 6 June 1939, becoming, at the time, the youngest Ambassador in Washington, D.C.. In April 1941, Hans Thomsen, a diplomat at the German embassy in Washington, D.C., sent a message to Joachim von Ribbentrop, the German foreign minister, informing him that \\"an absolutely reliable source\\" had told Thomsen that the Americans had broken the Japanese diplomatic cipher (U.S. codename \\"Purple\\"). At least one historian identified this source as Umansky (in an indirect manner) based upon communications from U.S. Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles. The message was duly forwarded to the Japanese; but use of the code continued. Text from excerpt of first chapter on WNYC website Upon his return to Moscow, he worked at the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs. Promoted to the diplomatic rank of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary on 14 June 1943, Umansky was appointed by Stalin on 17 June 1943 as Ambassador of the Soviet Union to Mexico. Umansky presented his credentials to President of Mexico, Manuel √Åvila Camacho on 22 June 1943. At the ceremony of the presentation of credentials, Umansky presented his speech in English, for which he apologised to Camacho, promising that he would learn Spanish; he became fluent in just three months. The reasons for the posting of a diplomat the calibre of Umansky to Mexico was unclear, and it had been suggested on numerous occasions that Umansky was posted to Mexico as part of undercover activities, though the U.S. news- magazine Time said in 1945 that Umansky's behaviour as a diplomat was always above reproach. However, according to U.S. Secretary of State (1933‚Äì1944) Cordell Hull: It has also been suggested that Umansky was posted to Mexico as part of a campaign to improve perceptions of the Soviet Union, which had taken a battering following the Stalin-orchestrated assassination of Leon Trotsky in Mexico in 1940. According to Germ√°n List Arzubide, Umansky was the most popular diplomat in Mexico. Due to the efforts of Umansky, by the end of 1944 Soviet‚ÄìMexico relations had regained a friendly character, and both countries intended to expand their relations in the post-war period. On 8 July 1944, Umansky was appointed as Ambassador of the Soviet Union to Costa Rica, in concurrence with his posting in Mexico. On 25 January 1945, Umansky was to have travelled to San Jos√© in Costa Rica to present his Letters of Credence to Costa Rican President Teodoro Picado Michalski, however the Mexican Air Force plane which he was aboard crashed on take-off in Mexico City, killing the Ambassador, his wife (Raisa Umanskaya) and three embassy officials. The cause of the crash is still unknown to this day, and following the crash tens of thousands of Mexicans paid their respects to Umansky at the Soviet Embassy, led by President Camacho. In an obituary, Mexican newspaper Exc√©lsior wrote \\"With Umansky, a new era in local diplomatic activity has begun. Many foreign diplomats have passed through Mexico, but those whom were here at that time, should recognise that they lived in the diplomatic world of the Umansky era\\".

It is the principal base for logistic support with various facilities stretched over of land. In addition to the workplaces, the base houses apartment-like barracks, social facilities, a military hospital, a military museum and an archive for naval history. The shipyard at the base is capable of constructing frigates, submarines, fast attack boats and auxiliary vessels with high technology in recognized standards.  History  In the late 1920s, the area in G√∂lc√ºk was chosen to build a floating drydock large enough to hold the Turkish battlecruiser TCG Yavuz for repair work of her war damage. Later, along with the German shipbuilding company Flender Werke that constructed the floating drydock, various repair shops, plants for the production of naval mine, torpedo and battery and housing barracks were built in G√∂lc√ºk. In this manner, the need of drydocking of the TCG Yavuz paved the road G√∂lc√ºk's to the naval base. These facilities were extended with various other buildings stretching over a big swampland, a small lake and hazelnut orchard fields in G√∂lc√ºk. The Convention on the Turkish straits, part of the Treaty of Lausanne signed in 1923, banned military facilities in the Turkish Straits. So, Turkish Navy's infrastructure, like shipyards and naval facilities, at the Golden Horn and ƒ∞stinye in Istanbul were systematically relocated to G√∂lc√ºk. Main warships of the Turkish Navy, like battlecruisers, destroyers and torpedo boats, were then stationed in G√∂lc√ºk. Finally, in 1933 the parliament enacted G√∂lc√ºk as the main naval base of the Turkish Navy. = 1999 ƒ∞zmit earthquake = The headquarters of the Battle Fleet Command in G√∂lc√ºk, established in 1964, and many other buildings were heavily destroyed by the ƒ∞zmit earthquake on August 17, 1999. The Command was temporarily housed in the Preveze War Games Center at the same base until July 2000, when the new headquarters building was completed. The earthquake cost the lives of 441 base personnel in total including 28 navy officers of various ranks, 136 warrant officers, one naval cadet, 39 civil officials, 9 corporals, 82 seamen and 126 workers. Rear admiral Orhan Aydƒ±n, commander of the Turkish Naval Academy in Tuzla, Istanbul, was among the victims of the earthquake. = 2016 Turkish coup d'etat attempt = On 16 July 2016, a Turkish anti-government group seized a frigate, later identified as the , from the G√∂lc√ºk Naval Base.

They are commonly used as final filters in commercial applications or as prefilters for HEPA filters in hospitals in the Pharmaceutical Industry. Pocket filters were historically produced from glass fiber media, however in recent a years a shift to synthetic media took place. Glass fiber media is prone to bacterial growth and shedding. On the other hand, it has the advantage of increased filtration efficiency over time. Synthetic media filters are usually electrostatically charged to increase efficiency. The drawback of this approach is the media loses efficiency by as much as 75% over time. To remedy this manufacturers have introduced new multilayer synthetic media with a smaller fiber diameter. Not only does this approach contribute to a limited loss of efficiency, but also to a service life that is longer by more than 30%. Some filters come with bacteriostatically treated media to prevent bacterial growth, while others come with a media that is inherently not suitable for bacterial growth. Pocket filters come with a pocket number of 3-12 depending on the frame size. Frame material can be Metal of Plastic. The most common frame sizes (in mm) are: *592 x 592 *592 x 490 *592 x 287 *287 x 287 Despite the advances in synthetic media, pocket filters are slowly being overtaken by rigid type filters made from glass fiber paper or more recently from nanofiber. These filters usually offer a service life that is 4-8 times what is offered by pocket filters at a lower energy expenditure.

A simple observation shows that an 'ordinary' Dirichlet series : \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{a_n}{n^s}, is obtained by substituting \\\\lambda_n=\\\\ln n while a power series : \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n (e^{-s})^n, is obtained when \\\\lambda_n=n.  Fundamental theorems  If a Dirichlet series is convergent at s_0=\\\\sigma_0+t_0i, then it is uniformly convergent in the domain : \\\\arg(s-s_0) \\\\leq \\\\theta < \\\\frac \\\\pi 2, and convergent for any s=\\\\sigma+ti where \\\\sigma>\\\\sigma_0. There are now three possibilities regarding the convergence of a Dirichlet series, i.e. it may converge for all, for none or for some values of s. In the latter case, there exist a \\\\sigma_c such that the series is convergent for \\\\sigma>\\\\sigma_c and divergent for \\\\sigma<\\\\sigma_c. By convention, \\\\sigma_c=\\\\infty if the series converges nowhere and \\\\sigma_c=-\\\\infty if the series converges everywhere on the complex plane.  Abscissa of convergence  The abscissa of convergence of a Dirichlet series can be defined as \\\\sigma_c above. Another equivalent definition is : \\\\sigma_c = \\\\inf\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}:\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n e^{-\\\\lambda_n s} \\\\text{ converges for every } s \\\\text{ for which } \\\\operatorname{Re}(s)>\\\\sigma \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. The line \\\\sigma=\\\\sigma_c is called the line of convergence. The half-plane of convergence is defined as : \\\\mathbb{C}_{\\\\sigma_c}=\\\\\\\\{s\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}: \\\\operatorname{Re}(s)>\\\\sigma_c\\\\\\\\}. The abscissa, line and half-plane of convergence of a Dirichlet series are analogous to radius, boundary and disk of convergence of a power series. On the line of convergence, the question of convergence remains open as in the case of power series. However, if a Dirichlet series converges and diverges at different points on the same vertical line, then this line must be the line of convergence. The proof is implicit in the definition of abscissa of convergence. An example would be the series : \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac 1 n e^{-ns}, which converges at s=-\\\\pi i (alternating harmonic series) and diverges at s=0 (harmonic series). Thus, \\\\sigma=0 is the line of convergence. Suppose that a Dirichlet series does not converge at s=0, then it is clear that \\\\sigma_c\\\\geq0 and \\\\sum a_n diverges. On the other hand, if a Dirichlet series converges at s=0, then \\\\sigma_c\\\\leq0 and \\\\sum a_n converges. Thus, there are two formulas to compute \\\\sigma_c, depending on the convergence of \\\\sum a_n which can be determined by various convergence tests. These formulas are similar to the Cauchy‚ÄìHadamard theorem for the radius of convergence of a power series. If \\\\sum a_k is divergent, i.e. \\\\sigma_c\\\\geq0, then \\\\sigma_c is given by : \\\\sigma_c=\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{\\\\loga_1+a_2+\\\\cdots+a_n}{\\\\lambda_n}. If \\\\sum a_k is convergent, i.e. \\\\sigma_c\\\\leq0, then \\\\sigma_c is given by : \\\\sigma_c=\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{\\\\loga_{n+1}+a_{n+2}+\\\\cdots}{\\\\lambda_n}.  Abscissa of absolute convergence  A Dirichlet series is absolutely convergent if the series : \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n e^{-\\\\lambda_n s}, is convergent. As usual, an absolutely convergent Dirichlet series is convergent, but the converse is not always true. If a Dirichlet series is absolutely convergent at s_0, then it is absolutely convergent for all s where \\\\operatorname{Re}(s) > \\\\operatorname{Re}(s_0). A Dirichlet series may converge absolutely for all, for no or for some values of s. In the latter case, there exist a \\\\sigma_a such that the series converges absolutely for \\\\sigma>\\\\sigma_a and converges non-absolutely for \\\\sigma<\\\\sigma_a. The abscissa of absolute convergence can be defined as \\\\sigma_a above, or equivalently as : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma_a=\\\\inf \\\\Big\\\\\\\\{\\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}:\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n e^{-\\\\lambda_n s} & \\\\text{ converges absolutely for} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\text{every } s \\\\text{ for which} \\\\operatorname{Re}(s)>\\\\sigma\\\\Big\\\\\\\\}. \\\\end{align} The line and half-plane of absolute convergence can be defined similarly. There are also two formulas to compute \\\\sigma_a. If \\\\sum a_k is divergent, then \\\\sigma_a is given by : \\\\sigma_a=\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{\\\\log(a_1+a_2+\\\\cdots+a_n)}{\\\\lambda_n}. If \\\\sum a_k is convergent, then \\\\sigma_a is given by : \\\\sigma_a=\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{\\\\log(a_{n+1}+a_{n+2}+\\\\cdots)}{\\\\lambda_n}. In general, the abscissa of convergence does not coincide with abscissa of absolute convergence. Thus, there might be a strip between the line of convergence and absolute convergence where a Dirichlet series is conditionally convergent. The width of this strip is given by : 0\\\\leq\\\\sigma_a-\\\\sigma_c\\\\leq L:=\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{\\\\log n}{\\\\lambda_n}. In the case where L = 0, then : \\\\sigma_c=\\\\sigma_a=\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{\\\\log a_n}{\\\\lambda_n}. All the formulas provided so far still hold true for 'ordinary' Dirichlet series by substituting \\\\lambda_n=\\\\log n.  Other abscissas of convergence  It is possible to consider other abscissas of convergence for a Dirichlet series. The abscissa of bounded convergence \\\\sigma_b is given by \\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma_b =\\\\inf \\\\Big\\\\\\\\{\\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}:\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n e^{-\\\\lambda_n s} & \\\\text{ is bounded in the half-plane } \\\\operatorname{Re}(s) \\\\geq \\\\sigma\\\\Big\\\\\\\\}, \\\\end{align} while the abscissa of uniform convergence \\\\sigma_u is given by \\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma_u =\\\\inf \\\\Big\\\\\\\\{\\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}:\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n e^{-\\\\lambda_n s} & \\\\text{ converges uniformly in the half-plane } \\\\operatorname{Re}(s) \\\\geq \\\\sigma\\\\Big\\\\\\\\}. \\\\end{align} These abscissas are related to the abscissa of convergence \\\\sigma_c and of absolute convergence \\\\sigma_a by the formulas \\\\sigma_c \\\\leq \\\\sigma_b \\\\leq \\\\sigma_u \\\\leq \\\\sigma_a, and a remarkable theorem of Bohr in fact shows that for any ordinary Dirichlet series where \\\\lambda_n = \\\\ln(n) (i.e. Dirichlet series of the form \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n n^{-s}) , \\\\sigma_u = \\\\sigma_b and \\\\sigma_a \\\\leq \\\\sigma_u + 1/2; Bohnenblust and Hille subsequently showed that for every number d \\\\in [0, 0.5] there are Dirichlet series \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n n^{-s} for which \\\\sigma_a - \\\\sigma_u = d. A formula for the abscissa of uniform convergence \\\\sigma_u for the general Dirichlet series \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n e^{-\\\\lambda_n s} is given as follows: for any N \\\\geq 1, let U_N = \\\\sup_{t \\\\in \\\\R} \\\\\\\\{ \\\\sum_{n=1}^N a_n e^{it\\\\lambda_n} \\\\\\\\}, then \\\\sigma_u = \\\\lim_{N \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}\\\\frac{\\\\log U_N}{\\\\lambda_N}.  Analytic functions  A function represented by a Dirichlet series : f(s)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}a_n e^{-\\\\lambda_n s}, is analytic on the half-plane of convergence. Moreover, for k=1,2,3,\\\\ldots : f^{(k)}(s)=(-1)^k\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}a_n\\\\lambda_n^k e^{-\\\\lambda_n s}.  Further generalizations  A Dirichlet series can be further generalized to the multi-variable case where \\\\lambda_n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^k, k = 2, 3, 4,..., or complex variable case where \\\\lambda_n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}^m, m = 1, 2, 3,...

It was founded on 13 July 1992. It primarily manages the Border Service of Kazakhstan, which conducts oversight over the international borders of Kazakhstan. The NSC also oversees and Arystan ('Lions') commando unit. History The NSC was created in accordance with a law passed by parliament in July 1992 which authorised the establishment of an agency to replace the KGB, the old national security apparatus of the Soviet Union. Initially, it retained most of the staff which the KGB had employed in Kazakhstan, as well as the powers the KGB had held; its first head, Bulat Baekenov, had worked for the KGB for over two decades. Its early years were marked by close cooperation with Russia on issues of border security and counter-intelligence against alleged foreign spies. In December 1995, a new presidential decree modified some of the NSC's powers. In November 2008, journalist Ramazan Yesergepov published an article entitled \\"Who Rules the Country: President or National Security Committee?\\" It contained private NSC correspondence which was later listed as classified, resulting in his 2009 arrest and conviction on security charges. The case led to domestic and international condemnation. In January 2010, Kazakhstani president Nursultan Nazarbayev appointed his nephew Samat Abish as the NSC's head of human resources; opposition lawmaker Serikbolsyn Abdildin of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan claimed this shows that Nazarbayev considers personal loyalty more important than skill in government posts. Border Service The Border Service (, ) is a paramilitary agency of the NSC that serves to protect the international borders of Kazakhstan. It is the successor to the Eastern Border District of the Soviet Committee of State Security (KGB). Various border agreement are made with bordering countries such as Russia, China and Kyrgyzstan in order to prevent terrorist activities from occurring on the border. It is mainly composed of border units and checkpoints, air police, a coast guard as well as other support units. Arystan Commando Unit The shoulder patch of the unit. The Arystan (\\"Lions\\") Commando Unit () is a special forces unit of the Office of the NSC and the armed forces.Mariya Y. Omelicheva, Counterterrorism Policies in Central Asia, page 119. It was created as part of the Presidential Security Service on 13 January 1992. It succeeded the Alpha Group of the Soviet KGB, which was dissolved in October 1990. Since April 1993, the unit has been referred to as the Arystan Unit. Every year, personnel of the unit are required to pass a qualifying exam. It currently operates in Nur-Sultan, Almaty, and Aktau (the latter being done in order to ensure safety in the oil- producing fields).–û –º–µ—Ä–∞—Ö –ø–æ –¥–∞–ª—å–Ω–µ–π—à–µ–º—É —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—é –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–æ–≤ –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –±–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∏ –ö–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å—Ç–∞–Ω ‚Äî –£–∫–∞–∑ –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∏ –ö–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å—Ç–∞–Ω –æ—Ç 22 –Ω–æ—è–±—Ä—è 2016 –≥–æ–¥–∞ ‚Ññ 372—Å Its nickname is the Holy Slim of Kazakhstan (“ö–∞—Å–∏–µ—Ç—Ç—ñ –ï–ª—ñ–º “ö–∞–∑–∞“õ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω).

Following rehabilitation and expansion, the generation capacity of this installation is . Location The power station is located across the Kwanza River, in Cambambe, Angola, about , by road, southeast of Luanda, the capital and largest city in the country. The geographical coordinates of the power station are:09¬∞45'12.0\\"S, 14¬∞28'51.0\\"E (Latitude:-9.753333; Longitude:14.480833). Overview The construction of Cambambe 1 Dam was started on October 7, 1959 and finished in 1963. Due to wear and tear as well as lack of maintenance, by 2002, output had fallen from 180 megawatts to approximately 80 megawatts. In April 2007, a consortium comprising Odebrecht, Voith, Alstom and Engevix, was hired by the Empresa Nacional de Electricidade, to carry out the project of rehabilitation, expansion and modernization of the dam and power station. The project includes the heightening of the structure by 30 meters, the modernization of the generating units of the Cambambe 1, replacing the four 45 MW turbines by four 65 MW turbines, and the construction of a new plant, called Cambambe 2, with four generating units of 175 MW each, for a total of 700 MW. The works in Cambambe 1 started in March, 2009 and in Cambambe 2 in 2013. Construction In July 2015, it was anticipated that the first 175 megawatts turbine of Cambambe II, would be installed and come online in June 2016, with completion expected in 2017. Other upgrades included the construction of three new energy transformation substations, with capacities 400KV, 220KV and 60KV, to support connection between Cambambe 1 and 2, Capanda Hydroelectric Power Station and La√∫ca Hydroelectric Power Station. The renovation and upgrade of Cambambe 1 and the construction of Cambambe 2, cost an estimated US$2 billion.

M. Coetzee's novel of the same name. It was adapted for the screen by Anna Maria Monticelli and directed by her husband Steve Jacobs. Starring American actor John Malkovich and South African newcomer Jessica Haines, it tells the story of a South African university professor in the post-apartheid era who moves to his daughter's Eastern Cape farm when his affair with a student costs him his position. It received generally positive reviews. Plot summary David Lurie (John Malkovich) is an ageing white professor teaching Romantic literature at an unnamed university in Cape Town shortly after the end of apartheid. David has an affair with one of his students, Melanie Isaacs (Antoinette Engel). University officials learn of the incident and bring David before a disciplinary board. David's colleagues offer him a quiet exit to save face, but he brashly affirms his guilt and refuses to admit wrongdoing, forcing the board to punish him more harshly. David takes refuge with his daughter, Lucy (Jessica Haines), who owns a farm in the Eastern Cape. At first, the two experience harmony and Lurie finds peace with himself, though he grows suspicious of Lucy's farm manager, Petrus (Eriq Ebouaney). One day, David and Lucy are attacked by three men, who rape Lucy. David goes through a crisis, not knowing how to cope with his personal and family tragedies. He is also confused by the newfound guilt he suddenly feels about these rapes. In a movement toward penance, David goes back to his former student's home to beg for forgiveness from her and her family.

It received generally positive reviews in the media. For example, The Washington Post concluded that \\"Like the novel, the film goes where it must, not where the dictates of off-the-rack narrative compel it. Jacobs has made some smart choices, including tucking the novel's last scene into the body of the film, lessening its inevitable bathos if taken straight from page to screen. The anguishing confrontations between David and Lucy, David and the family of the woman he has wronged, David and Lucy's neighbors, and ultimately, between David and the reality of a modern South Africa, are as powerful here as in the book.\\" The film has an 83% favorable rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 60 votes. The critical consensus states that \\"Featuring outstanding performances from John Malkovich and newcomer Jessica Haines, Disgrace is a disturbing, powerful drama.\\" The film holds an average score of 71/100 at Metacritic.

James was born May 1, 1848 in Philadelphia, in a long line of McCreas who came to Delaware and Pennsylvania near two hundred years earlier. His parents were James Alexander McCrea and Ann Bispham Foster. He attended the University of Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania Polytechnic College, gaining an education in civil engineering. He began railroad work with the Connellsville & Southern Pennsylvania Railroad in June 1865. In December 1867 he began work on the Wilmington & Reading Railroad, and in September 1868 with the Allegheny Valley Railroad. In March 1871 he began work with the Pennsylvania Railroad as principal assistant engineer working on construction. He advanced rapidly from that point. In 1874 he became assistant engineer of maintenance of way of the Philadelphia Division, then division superintendent of the Middle Division in January 1875, and of the New York Division in October 1878. In May 1882 he was transferred to Columbus, Ohio to become manager of the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati & St. Louis Railroad‚Äîthe Pennsylvania Railroad‚Äôs principal subsidiary between Pittsburgh and St. Louis. In October 1885 he became general manager. The Pennsylvania Railroad named him fourth vice president in October 1887, in March 1890 second vice president, and in April 1891 first vice president. The vice presidencies gave him responsibility for the lines west of Pittsburgh. In June 1899 he was named a director of the Pennsylvania Railroad when Alexander J. Cassatt was made the road‚Äôs president. When Cassatt died in January 1907, McCrea became the president and held the position until January 1913, when he resigned, in part because of his health.

The 1903 incident was Wyoming's worst coal mining disaster. Background In 1889, Union Pacific Railroad needed a reliable fuel source to run its massive coal-fired engines. After the coal mines in Carbon, Wyoming ran out, it hastily formed the Union Pacific Coal Company and opened a mine at Chimney Springs.\\"Hanna, Towns One, Two and Three\\". Coal Camp Photos, From Wyoming Tales and Trails Chimney Springs was renamed Hanna in honor of Marcus A. Hanna, a member of Union Pacific Company management and an Ohio United States Senator. Hanna, Wyoming was founded and built by the Union Pacific Coal Company for its workers and their families, and the Union Pacific owned everything in it, including the boarding house, the general store and the miners' houses that were rented to them by the month. Hanna was a major hub of the emerging transportation industry of the day with the Union Pacific Railroad and the Overland Trail passing through. 1903 disaster In those days, coal was mined by dynamite and the backs of men loading it into donkey- drawn carts. Men worked long hours in the dark, faces covered in black dust. The disaster at the Union Pacific Coal Company Hanna mine #1 occurred on June 30, 1903. Coal mine gas (methane) was ignited in Mine No. 1 causing a violent explosion and a mine cave-in, killing 169 miners, while 46 survivors narrowly escaped this disaster.Jay Robert Nash, \\"Darkest Hours\\", Rowman & Littlefield, 1976, p. 230. . Many bodies, recovered over the next year, are buried in the nearby Hanna Cemetery.Lyn Wilkerson, \\"American Trails Revisited\\", iUniverse, 2003. . This tragedy was the greatest loss of life in any Wyoming mining disaster.Duane A. Simth, \\"Rocky Mountain heartland: Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming in the twentieth century\\", University of Arizona Press, 2008. . The mine's bosses blamed the accident on a careless miner and, because of a coal strike in Colorado, Union Pacific Coal Company reopened mine #1 a few months later. 1908 disaster On March 28, 1908 the Hanna Mine #1 exploded again, trapping 18 miners. As the state mine inspector and 40 rescuers entered the mine, a second explosion occurred and killed all 59 inside.James G. Speight, \\"The Chemistry and Technology of Coal\\", Third Edition, CRC Press, 2012. . Recovery teams eventually removed 27 bodies, but another 32 were left in the mountain.\\"1908 Hanna Mine Disaster Victims Buried In Hanna Cemetery In Unknown or Nameless Graves\\", Hanna Basin Museum With the 1903 blast leaving 169 men dead in the mine, 201 men are still buried there today. After the 1908 blast, the Wyoming state inspector blamed Union Pacific Coal Company's method of mining for the disaster. It was called \\"gouging\\", a system in which coal is mined immediately after the mine is opened, because it yields coal more quickly at the start of the operation. Gouging allows methane gas to gather in rooms already mined while miners are digging for coal deeper in the mountain. Had Union Pacific dug deep into the mountain first and mined the coal on their way back toward the surface, they would have been able to flood mined rooms with water. This would have prevented the buildup of methane gas, and saved many lives. The 1908 double explosions left 31 widows and orphaned 103 children. In settlements with Union Pacific Coal Company, each widow who lived in Hanna got $800 plus $50 for each child. Widows who returned to their homelands abroad got $350. The settlement barred any future claims against the company. Closing of the mines In the five-year period from 1903 through 1908, 228 had died in these two mine disasters in mine #1 before the creation of safety teams, safety laws or even the implementation of safety inspections. Just weeks before each blast, company mine inspectors gave Mine #1 glowing safety reviews. After 1908, the Union Pacific Coal Company permanently closed Mine #1. The Union Pacific Coal Company opened new mines in Hanna, hiring new miners. All of the Hanna mines closed in 1954 due to the Union Pacific Railroad's switching over to Diesel locomotives. Green grass now covers most of the hill that was once the entrance to Mine #1. This mine is now but a tomb marked with a now rusty ribbon of an abandoned railroad line.

This was the first act passed by the Scottish Parliament after its establishment in 1999. Purpose of Act The Act had two main purposes: The first was to add a new criterion to the statutory tests applied by a sheriff or the Scottish Ministers when considering whether to order the discharge of a restricted patient. The sheriff and the Scottish Ministers must now refuse to order a discharge (either conditional or absolute) if satisfied that the patient has a mental disorder, the effect of which is that continuing detention in hospital is necessary to protect the public from serious harm. That is so whether or not the patient is to receive medical treatment for the mental disorder. The second is to introduce a right of appeal against a decision, notification or recommendation of a sheriff in relation to an appeal brought by a restricted patient in terms of Part VI of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984. The right of appeal against the sheriff‚Äôs decision, notification or recommendation is conferred on both the patient and the Scottish Ministers. The appeal is to the Court of Session. The Act also widens the term 'mental disorder', which appears in earlier legislation, to include a personality disorder. History In December 1991, Noel Ruddle killed his neighbour with a Kalashnikov rifle. On 20 March 1992, Ruddle pled guilty to several charges at Glasgow High Court and was ordered to be detained and sent to Carstairs State Hospital without limit of time. Ruddle obtained his released in August 1999 after making a legal appeal at the Lanark Sheriff court on the basis that treatment programmes were no longer of benefit to him. With the risk of other patients at Carstairs making appeals on similar grounds, an emergency bill was quickly brought by the Scottish Executive to the Scottish Parliament. An executive bill was introduced by Jim Wallace on 31 August and some amendments made. passed on 8 September 1999 then gained Royal Assent on 13 September 1999, becoming the first legislation to be passed by the Parliament. In 2001, the legislation survived a challenge made to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The act was repealed on 5 October 2005 by the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.

Lickerish was a member of The Enid from its creation in 1974 until 1980, and appears on their first four studio albums and the two 'Live at Hammersmith' albums. He is an alumnus of the Finchden Manor school, as are fellow Enid founders Robert John Godfrey and Stephen Stewart.

After leaving The Enid he graduated from Sheffield Hallam University, later pursuing a career in counselling, and is a respected professional in the fields of adult addiction and family services, working at Clouds House, The Priory and Capio Nightingale Hospital. After a 20-year absence from the music industry, he formed a new band Secret Green, in 2006, who released their first album 'To Wake The King' in May 2009. Lickerish is married with three children and lives in Dorset, England. Work with The Enid Francis Lickerish's skill as a musician is second only to his skill as a storyteller. A much awaited feature of concerts given by The Enid was his storytelling. He would sit, often cross-legged, on stage and narrate a long \\"shaggy dog\\" style story while the roadies changed instruments or re-arranged the stage for the next set. Having their roots in traditional tales, the stories were novel time-fillers which would captivate an audience of thousands and entertain them while otherwise boring technical work was going on. A favourite of Enid fans was the story of The Archangel Barry. This was the introduction to \\"Albion Fair\\" in which an angel exhorted the band to write music with \\"more notes in it\\". His magnum opus however was the story of Fand. This ancient myth was amalgamated with the legends of King Arthur to create an epic and magical tale that was at once fresh and rooted in tradition.

Life and career A classmate of Sonny Cohn, after playing trombone in the McKinley High School band, Fleming went on to study at the Midwest College of Music. He had already led several informal bands before King Fleming and His Swing Band first performed in September 1942. When he was drafted into the U.S. Army in July 1943, the band continued performing under the leadership of other bandmembers until too many of its members had been called up for it to be viable. Discharged in 1945, Fleming started doing session work in Los Angeles and joined Johnnie Alston & His All Stars for recording dates backing Wynonie \\"Blues\\" Harris on Apollo. Johnny Alston and His Orchestra later signed for the Bihari Brothers' Modern label, and Fleming and Al \\"Cake\\" Wichard were joined by Addison Farmer. By mid-1946, Fleming had joined the Swing combo Oliver \\"King\\" Perry's Pied Pipers with Norman Bowden (trumpet); George \\"Happy\\" Johnson (trombone); Wesley Prince (bass) and Joe Harris (drums) before returning to Chicago to lead his own King Fleming's Four with Jay Peters (tenor sax), \\"Hog\\" Mason (bass), and Tommy Hill (drums) and getting a write-up in Down Beat for June 18, 1947. In 1950 he was a member of the Dallas Bartley Quartet, with Johnny Thompson (tenor sax) and Oliver Coleman (drums), and that summer he recorded as a session pianist for the vocal group, the Dozier Boys, at their recording session for Chess Records. Later that year he joined Oliver Coleman's Palmaires; the other members were Nelson Berry (tenor saxophone) and Sylvester Hickman (bass). In 1954 he finally recorded under his own name, on the Blue Lake label, with John Neely (tenor saxophone); Russell Williams (bass); Aubrie Jones (drums); Lorez Alexandria (vocals) and in 1955 for the Chess label. The Chess brothers invited him back the following year, again with vocalist Lorez Alexandria, to record \\"Stompin' at the Savoy\\". In 1957, his group backed Lorez Alexandria on her first two albums for the King label, and collaborated with Muhal Richard Abrams, who wrote arrangements for a King Fleming-led big band. Between 1960 and 1965, he recorded three piano trio albums for Argo and Cadet Records, which were Phil and Leonard Chess's jazz labels. He also appeared on two singles released locally by singer George Green. After many years during which his trio worked steadily in the Chicago area without drawing interest from the recording industry, King Fleming resurfaced on the Southport label in 1996.

He belonged to the leading actors in the Swedish theatre history.  Background  Gustav √Öbergsson was born to Jonas √Öberg, footman at the royal court, and Fredrika Maria Svahn. His father is thought to have been the son of Beata Sabina Straas, the first professional native actress in Sweden to perform on a public stage in 1737, although this is unconfirmed. =Stage career= He was a student at the French Theatre of Gustav III in Bollhuset in 1786, as was his sister Inga. According to popular legend, King Gustav III of Sweden originally placed him as a student in the Opera after having seen him in the park of Drottningholm Palace: after discovering that they shared the same name, the king asked him to sing a song. Gustav did so and blew kisses to the audience after, and the king had kissed him on his forehead. He made his debut on the Royal Dramatic Theatre in 1788, but performed on the Stenborg Theatre until he was finally given a contract at the royal theatre in 1798. He changed his surname from √Öberg to √Öbergsson, because he wanted to avoid being connected to his sister, actress and opera singer, Inga √Öberg (1773‚Äì1837). Gustav √Öbergsson was described as beautiful, with a fine figure, posture and grace and an easy manner, and was often given hero- and lover parts: \\"roles, which demands a beautiful body and pleasantness\\".Nordensvan, Georg, Svensk teater och svenska sk√•despelare fr√•n Gustav III till v√•ra dagar.

In 1812, he was made prefect of the dramatic stage. In 1819, he and his spouse played the leading parts in Romeo and Juliet, the first time this play was performed in Stockholm (though it had been performed in Norrk√∂ping in 1776). In 1820‚Äì23, he was director of the Segerlind Theatre in Gothenburg. After this, he was instructor and from 1828‚Äì31, headmaster of Dramatens elevskola. He retired in 1834. =Private life= He was married to the ballet dancer Margaretha Christina Hallongren (d. 1810) in 1793, and had a relationship with the star actress Carolina Kuhlman (1778-1866) for several years before they married in 1815. √Öbergsson was buried at Norra begravningsplatsen outside Stockholm.

Kingdoms of the Wall is a 1992 science fiction novel by American writer Robert Silverberg. It is set on a faraway planet inhabited by an alien race and (as is revealed only at the very end) in an undefined future. Its subject is the perpetual communal quest for knowledge in the face of hardship and wonders, which through the revelation of an unexpected and devastating truth results in the deconstruction and slaying of gods. Plot introduction The story's protagonist is Poilar Crookleg, member of a humanoid race with a pastoral civilization at a level roughly corresponding to that of the Iron Age of human civilization. Only as the story develops it becomes apparent that these people are not humans; their hands have an additional opposing thumb, and they have limited shapeshifting abilities which allows them to loosen their joints, to adapt their skin and inner organs to environmental changes, and to extrude suction cups for climbing. Shapeshifting is also an intrinsic part of their sexuality, for in the absence of sexual arousal both sexes maintain a neuter form without overt gender characteristics. The planet is located in a binary star system where it seems to be in orbit around the major white and luminous component, Ekmelios (probably an F-type star) while reddish Marilemma (apparently an M-type red dwarf) is much more distant. Plot summary Poilar is a youngster in his village, Jespodar, which is situated at the rim of a lowland (extremely hot and humid with a very dense atmosphere by earthly standards, as can be deduced) immediately at the foothills of The Wall, a huge mountain range complex that rises to an unseen summit. The peoples' religion revolves around The Wall since thousands of planet-years ago the semi-mythical First Climber ascended to the summit where he met The Gods who introduced him to the basics of civilization. From this time onward, the people of Jespodar (as well as those of numerous other villages) pledged themselves to an annual pilgrimage of twenty men and twenty women who are supposed to re-enact the First Climber's achievement. The selection mechanisms for those aspiring to the pilgrimage are rigid and the three-year training is extremely challenging both physically and mentally. Each team of forty pilgrims that sets out for The Wall is the best the community can muster, according to general belief, but some pilgrims speculate that the selection process may include other motivations. However, for times unknown only a very few stragglers have returned to Jespodar at irregular intervals and these Returned Ones are mentally disturbed or in any case would not tell coherent stories of their experiences on The Wall. All that can be deduced is that on the various levels and segments of the huge mountain range there are distinct domains (the \\"kingdoms\\") populated by beings of variegated and extreme strangeness. Although nothing useful has been brought back from The Wall for times beyond remembrance, the annual pilgrimages continue with religious fervor. Poilar, whose father and grandfather had been pilgrims who never returned, is also pledged to The Wall. Together with his friend Traiben, a penetrating intellectual and skeptic, he is selected for the pilgrim group as he reaches the proper age. When they set out for The Wall, Poilar is elected leader of his Forty. As the pilgrims ascend they find that the fabled kingdoms are dwellings of former pilgrims who, by account of their various character flaws, have abandoned their pledge for the summit and have succumbed to one or the other specific enticement created by the \\"Change-Fire\\" forces emanating from the mountain. These stimulate and de-regulate their shapeshifter ability, turning their victims into grossly distorted beings - \\"Transformed Ones.\\" Each domain the pilgrim band traverses teaches them a personal lesson. As the pilgrims approach the last third of their journey they meet a totally exhausted alien being who - for all the strange set of his bodily frame, the fact that he has only one thumb on each five-fingered hand, and permanently extruded male genitals - does not seem to be a Transformed One. Speaking through a small translator box, he reveals that he has descended from the summit to reconnoiter; now he is in no physical shape to return to his colleagues, who in turn cannot retrieve him because of unspecified problems at the summit. When asked whether he has seen the gods who are supposed to reside there, the Earthman becomes very evasive. The human alien soon dies, and because Poilar had given his solemn promise to take him to the summit he orders the corpse to be eviscerated and preserved so that it can be carried onward. As the band proceeds, its members dwindle away fast. Immediately below the cloud sheath veiling the summit, Poilar and his tattered and decimated team stumble upon an Arcadia-like domain whose inhabitants are not transformed but ageless - they have discovered a Fountain of Youth. The local king turns out to be Poilar's grandfather who begs him not to proceed to the summit because there is only grief to be found there. He reveals that his own son (Poilar's father) did not heed this advice, and together with all his surviving companions had sought obliteration in the Fountain of Youth on the return trip. Indeed, the kingdoms on the highest level of the mountain seem to be populated mostly by those who had been to the summit. Nevertheless, Poilar takes the remainder of his team to the summit plateau, where the pilgrims break through the clouds to arrive under a strange sky (blue instead of the accustomed white), totally exhausted from physical exertion in what for them is air of unbearable coldness and almost too thin to support respiration, in spite of all shapeshifter adjustments they are capable of. Having achieved the sworn objective of their lives, they are utterly shattered by what they see: no palaces with gods blissfully ambling around, but a horde of ape-like savage creatures laying siege to three Earthmen in a small spaceship. The decayed ruins of another, much larger and very old, spaceship hull can be seen in the distance. In their despair and disgust, Poilar and his pilgrims decide to purge the summit; they throw every single one of the debased creatures into the abyss. The besieged humans then emerge from their spaceship and relate, in terms that Poilar and his people can comprehend, that they are a survey team from Earth that is charged with checking the status of human colonies with which contact has been lost. The members of the colony that had been established on the summit of The Wall (the only place on the planet where conditions seemed Earth-like) had been the gods whom the First Climber had met. Apparently, over the many generations since the First Climber had encountered the colony, the humans had degenerated under the radiation of the planet's sun and the emanations from the mountain range to become the ape-like creatures Poilar's team has slaughtered. Having assured the pilgrims that no Earthmen would ever intrude on them again, the patrol ship takes off. Poilar and his team return to his village and relate the truth about their \\"gods\\" to their people, thereby ending all pilgrimages and putting their race on a new track of civilization that could ultimately make them into something like their gods of old: \\"It will be our task to build wagons to carry us between villages, and then sky-wagons, and then star-wagons, and then we will meet the gods again; but this time it will be as equals.\\" References *Silverberg, R.

Along with the Wills Act 1837, the 1963 Act is the principal Act dealing with wills in the United Kingdom. The 1963 Act allows a will to be considered \\"properly executed\\" if it was executed in line with local law in the state where it was executed, the state where the testator lived or the state the testator was a citizen of, rather than applying United Kingdom law to all wills. Background The 1861 Act, known as Lord Kingsdown's Act, was a frequently used example of the conflict between various national laws because of the different standards it set between subjects and wills from the United Kingdom and from other nations.Morris (1964) p.685 In addition it failed to distinguish between movable and immovable property, and immovable property had to be compatible with the law of the state it was in, with no consideration for the nationality of the testator or any other factors. The meeting of the produced a Draft Convention on the Formal Validity of Wills, and combined with the Fourth Report of the Lord Chancellor's Private International Law Committee this provided enough incentive for the government to introduce a bill repealing the 1861 Act and replacing it with something that meshed with the law of other states. The bill was introduced to the House of Commons on 21 November 1962, given its second reading on 22 February 1963, and received the Royal Assent on 31 July 1963. Provisions of the Act The Act is divided into seven sections. Section 1 allows a will to be considered \\"properly executed\\" if it was executed in line with the laws in the state where it was executed, the state the testator lived in up to his death or the state the testator was a citizen of.The Wills Act 1963, section 1 This gets rid of the problem with the 1861 Act which meant that wills could be declared formally invalid if not executed in a very narrow way - wills of British citizens had to be executed in line with British law, regardless of where the citizen lived. It has been suggested that \\"will\\" should include similar things in nations with different types of inheritance, such as the \\"contracts of inheritance\\" in German and Swiss law.O.K.F (1964) p.57 Section 1 deliberately makes no distinction between wills of real property and wills of personal property. Section 2 allows a will to be considered executed if it is executed on board an aircraft or ship in a fashion which follows the law of the state in which the aircraft is registered.The Wills Act 1963, section 2(1)(a) If a will disposes of real property it is considered executed if it conforms to the law in the state the property was in,The Wills Act 1963, section 2(1)(b) and a will overturning a previous will is considered executed if its purpose is to overturn a previous will valid under the Act, or terms of a previous will which would not be considered valid under the Act.The Wills Act 1963, section 2(1)(c) A will to appoint executors is considered similarly executed.The Wills Act 1963, section 2(1)(d) Section 3 takes into account the laws of other states on the make-up of a will, and says that the way a will is constructed does not have to be changed if the testator moves state after the will is executed. Section 5 took into account the Scottish system of property transfer,O.K.F (1964) p.58 but was repealed by the Succession (Scotland) Act 1964.The Wills Act 1963, section 5 Sections 6 and 7 are procedural ones, which define certain terms and indicate that the Act comes into force on 1 January 1964.The Wills Act 1963, section 7 See also *Wills Act ReferencesBibliography Primary sources * Secondary sources United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1963 ","title":"Wills Act 1963"},{"id":"23823628","text":"Sarcoptes is a genus of mites.

It is distributed around the Mediterranean Sea, and from the north Atlantic Ocean to south Morocco. It is also found in the British Isles at its northern limit in the northeast Atlantic. Its common name is derived from the honeycomb-like pattern it creates when building its tube reefs. Description The tubes of Sabellaria alveolata Sabellaria alveolata is an annelid (ringed worm) that lives in small tubes it constructs from cemented coarse sand and/or shell material, forming reefs. The tubes are arranged in close proximity and have a distinctive honeycomb-like appearance. These reefs range from to Hermelles thick and take the form of hummocks, sheets or more massive formations. Adult size ranges from . The thorax has three pairs of flattened chaetal sheaths, its chaetes form an operculum which is used to seal the tube opening. Depending on the local substrate, the colour of the tube varies. Distribution Sabellaria alveolata is found in the Mediterranean and the north Atlantic from Britain south to Morocco. In Britain and Ireland it is mainly found on southern and western coasts from the Western Isles to Cornwall. Habitat and ecology Sabellaria alveolata occurs on the bottom third or so of the intertidal zone and in the shallow subtidal zone. The worms construct different types of structures depending on the conditions. Where it occurs along rocky shorelines among bladderwrack then the agglomeration of tubes vary from thin encrustations if they are present at low densities to dense hummocks and mounds where there is a high density. The tubes are built from shell fragments or sand and are used to protect the worm from predators and can be repaired if damaged near the entrance. The tube is made up of a number of overlapping layers of material glued together with mucus. There are two sexes and spawning takes place in the Spring and again in the Autumn. The larvae develop in the water column and can detect the substance the adults use to bind their tubes and follow this to find a location to settle on. They are filter feeders and use cilia covered tentacles to extract food from the water. The reefs that they build encourage biodiversity. Conservation Sabellaria alveolata is a United Kingdom, Biodiversity Action Plan species and the plan was published in 1994 and as part of the plan the reefs were mapped and surveyed. They are included on local Biodiversity Action Plans such as that for Newry, Mourne and Down in Northern Ireland to ensure local protection.

It is named after the historic East Riding of Yorkshire which was one of three ridings alongside the North Riding and West Riding, which were constituent parts a Yorkshire ceremonial and administrative county until 1974. From 1974 to 1996 the area of the modern East Riding of Yorkshire constituted the northern part of Humberside. Location As a ceremonial county, the East Riding of Yorkshire borders North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, and includes the city of Kingston upon Hull, which is a separate unitary authority. As a district it borders North East Lincolnshire (over the Humber estuary), North Lincolnshire (over the Humber and on land), Hull, Doncaster, Selby, York, Ryedale and Scarborough. Administrative history The East Riding originated in antiquity. Unlike most counties in Great Britain, which were divided anciently into hundreds, Yorkshire was divided first into three ridings and then into numerous wapentakes within each riding. The ancient wapentake system is not used in the modern day, though it is an important part of Yorkshire's cultural heritage. Within the East Riding of Yorkshire there were seven wapentakes (including Hull), two of these were further sub-divided into divisions, thus; { width=\\"50\\" valign=\\"top\\" 1\\\\.

Holderness ‚Äì South Division width=\\"30\\" valign=\\"top\\" } The separate Lieutenancy for the riding was established after the Restoration, and the ridings each had separate Quarter Sessions. For statistical purposes in the 19th century an East Riding of Yorkshire registration county was designated, consisting of the entirety of the poor law unions of Beverley, Bridlington, Driffield, Howden, Hull, Patrington, Pocklington, Sculcoates, Skirlaugh and York, thus excluding parts of the historic riding around Norton and Sherburn (which are also excluded from the modern district), but also including the city of York and environs (more usually associated with the West Riding). These poor law unions formed the basis of rural sanitary districts in 1875. The administrative county, shown with borders from 1965‚Äì1974 (Hull not indicated). A county council for the East Riding of Yorkshire was set up in 1889, covering an administrative county which did not cover the county borough of Hull, but otherwise had the same boundaries as the historic riding. Apart from Hull the East Riding contained two municipal boroughs, Beverley and Hedon. Under the Local Government Act 1894 the rest of the administrative county was divided into rural districts and urban districts. The rural districts were based on the rural sanitary districts, with Beverley Rural District, Bridlington Rural District, Driffield Rural District, Howden Rural District, Patrington Rural District, Pocklington Rural District, Riccal Rural District, Sculcoates Rural District and Skirlaugh Rural District being formed as-is. Several other rural districts were formed by divisions of rural sanitary districts to conform to the administrative county borders : Sherburn Rural District and Norton Rural District came from Scarborough and Malton RSDs respectively (otherwise in North Riding); Riccal Rural District from Selby RSD (otherwise in the West Riding); and Escrick Rural District which was previously part of York RSD (which covered all three ridings). Urban districts were Cottingham, Great Driffield, Filey, Hessle (from 1899), Hornsea, Norton, Pocklington and Withernsea (from 1898). The East Riding's only large town is Hull, a major port. Hull's population of which rose rapidly in the late 19th century : quadrupling from about 60,000 in 1851 to 240,000 in 1901. Other towns in the riding did not have similar growth and remain small: Bridlington's permanent population remained largely static in the same period, increasing from 6,000 to around 7,000. By 1971 the riding had a population of slightly over 500,000. In comparison, the West Riding (including county boroughs) saw extensive urbanisation and the formation of several conurbations, and had a population of nearly 4,000,000 in 1971, and the North Riding a population of about 700,000. Beverley was once a town of some importance, with St. John's College and Beverley Minster. The college was suppressed along with the monastery in the 16th century (see Dissolution of the Monasteries) and the town entered a decline in relative importance, although gaining a charter of incorporation in 1573, having previously been under the Archbishop of York. Beverley benefited somewhat from the proximity of Hull during the Industrial Revolution, and became the county town for the East Riding administrative county in 1892. The coat of arms of the East Riding County Council, granted in 1945 and used until 1974. Bridlington obtained municipal borough status in 1899, having become a resort town (as had Hornsea and Withernsea), although not matching the population growth of Scarborough further up the coast in the North Riding. The county districts underwent a major reorganisation in 1935 : *Derwent Rural District formed from most of Escrick RD, Riccal RD and part of Howden RD (which continued in existence) *Holderness Rural District formed from Patrington RD and Skirlaugh RD *Sherburn RD abolished, split between Bridlington RD, Norton RD and part to Filey UD *Sculcoates RD abolished, mostly to Beverley RD *Great Driffield urban district made smaller and renamed Driffield, the rural part going to Nafferton parish in Driffield Rural District *an urban district of Haltemprice formed to cover the urbanised area west of Hull, from Cottingham and Hessle urban districts, and parts of Sculcoates Rural District (including Haltemprice, West Ella and parts of other parishes) *Pocklington urban district abolished and added to Pocklington RD Both the administrative county and the historic Lieutenancy were abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974, with most of the riding going to form the northern part of Humberside. Some parts became part of North Yorkshire, with the borough of Scarborough taking in Filey UD and part of the Bridlington Rural District, the district of Ryedale taking in Norton and the former Norton Rural District, and the district of Selby taking in the former Derwent Rural District. Humberside also included northern Lincolnshire, and Goole and the former Goole Rural District, which are in the historic West Riding.HMSO. Local Government Act 1972. 1972 c.70 The creation of a cross-Humber authority was unpopular, despite the promise of the Humber Bridge (which ultimately opened in 1981), and identification with Yorkshire and the East Riding remained strong (for example, North Wolds District Council change its name to East Yorkshire Borough Council in the early 1980s, with Beverley also taking the name 'East Yorkshire Borough of Beverley'). This culminated with the local government review in the 1990s, which saw Humberside abolished and the northern part form two unitary authorities. East Riding of Yorkshire boundaries ‚Äì historic riding (pink and blue), modern county (pink & red) The East Riding district was formed on 1 April 1996 from the former districts of East Yorkshire, Beverley and Holderness, along with the northern part of the Boothferry district, including the Goole area which forms part of the historic West Riding (attaching it to the districts of Selby or Doncaster were proposed but rejected). The ceremonial county, the area in which the Lord Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire represents the Crown, was re-established the same day, covering Hull as well as the district.  Archaeology  The East Riding has two quite distinctive and contrasting archaeological areas, the Yorkshire Wolds and the Humber Wetlands. The Yorkshire Wolds form an upland arc of chalk hills stretching from Flamborough head on the coast to the Humber Estuary at its southern end. The Humber Wetlands consist of all the land in the Humber basin that lies below 10 metres above sea level which encompasses a large part of Holderness and the valleys of the Rivers Hull and Derwent and the lower part of the River Ouse valley. The Arctic conditions associated with the last Ice Age started to improve and the climate gradually became warmer about 10,000 BC. This warming-up process suffered several temporary setbacks as short, cool spells occurred which disrupted the overall momentum. By about 9,000 BC the vegetation had changed from tundra to a closed woodland, of pine and birch. Evidence from Gransmoor, to the east of Driffield, in Holderness indicates that Late Palaeolithic people were present in East Yorkshire during the climatic transition. In 1992, a small barbed antler harpoon point was found lodged in a preserved log, thought to be either birch or rowan. This find has been dated to around 9,500 BC. Between 8,300 and 4,000 BC, Mesolithic communities occupied the area. In the GreatWold Valley, at Willow Garth, to the west of Boynton, pollen samples of Mesolithic date, indicate that the forest cover in this area was being altered by man, and that open grasslands were being made to create grazing areas to which animals would be attracted thus making hunting easier. In the Yorkshire Wolds there are thousands of Iron Age square barrows and hundreds of farmsteads and settlements, droveways, tracks and field systems. There is a profusion of Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age and Romano-British sites extending across the entire Wolds area. Some Mesolithic sites are known on the chalklands of the Yorkshire Wolds, at Craike Hill (Eastburn Warren), Garton Slack, Huggate Dykes, Huggate Wold, and Octon Wold. The Yorkshire Wolds has a wide range of favourable natural resources and so became a major focus for human settlement during the Neolithic period. Two of the most recently excavated earthen long barrows in the region are to be found at Fordon, on Willerby Wold, and at Kilham, both of which have provided radiocarbon dates of around 3,700 BC. An extensive Neolithic ritual complex, the principal elements of which are four large cursus monuments and a henge, is situated near the eastern end of the Great Wold Valley. More than 1,400 Bronze Age round barrows, are known to exist on the Yorkshire Wolds, occurring either in isolation or, more usually, grouped together to form cemeteries. In the Iron Age the distinctive local tradition known as the Arras Culture emerged and was named after the type-site, found near Market Weighton, and excavated in 1815‚Äì17. Romano British villa sites are known on the Wolds at Rudston, Harpham, Brantingham, Welton, and Wharram-le-Street. Anglo-Saxon cemeteries are known from East Yorkshire. The Humber Wetlands Project which took place between 1992 and 2001 identified numerous prehistoric wetland sites in Holderness, the Hull Valley, the Humberhead Levels and the Vale of York. A boat found at North Ferriby, near Kingston upon Hull, has been dated as 2030 BC, which makes it the oldest of its kind in western Europe. New scientific research carried out on the remains shows it is at least 4,000 years old. The boat was one of three discovered by amateur archaeologist Ted Wright on the banks of the Humber. Historians knew that the boats were old, but only now do they know how old. New scientific techniques suggest the boat Mr Wright found in 1963 is 500 years older than everyone thought. That means it date backs more than 4,000 years to the early Bronze Age. The Ferriby site was an ideal point of departure for east/west travel along the Humber or as a crossing- point to the south bank. The Ferriby Boats were a means by which ideas, such as the decorative design of pottery, and goods such as Baltic amber and metals could arrive on the Humber shore. It has also been suggested that it may have been used to carry stones to Stonehenge. Norman period The Battle of Stamford Bridge took place at the village of Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire on 25 September 1066. In the battle the majority of the invading Norwegian forces were killed by the forces of King Harold Godwinson of England. It was the final fall of the Vikings in England. A fortnight after the battle, on 14 October 1066, after having marched his forces to the south coast of England, Harold was defeated and killed by Norman forces under William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings. This began the Norman Conquest of England. In Holderness the extensive Lordship was granted by King William I of England to Drogo de la Beuvirere, a Flemish follower. Drogo built a castle at Skipsea before 1087 but he was disgraced and his estates were confiscated by the king. The area was then given to Odo, Count of Champagne, but was taken from him when he rebelled against King William II of England in 1095. It was returned to Odo's son Stephen of Aumale in 1102. Large estates in Holderness were held by the Bishop of Durham and the Archbishop of York. Other large landowners in the area included the abbeys of Meaux and Thornton and the priories of Swine, Nunkeeling and Bridlington. These ecclesiastical estates were confiscated and became crown property when King Henry VIII of England dissolved the monasteries in the 16th century. The Yorkshire Wolds is rich in medieval sites, and is particularly well known for its deserted villages, like those at Wharram Percy and Cottam. Settlement on the Wolds during the medieval period was concentrated on the most suitable agricultural soils. The two major settlement zones are, the Great Wold Valley villages, such as Helperthorpe, Weaverthorpe, Butterwick, Foxholes, Burton Flemming and Rudston, and the east- facing slope of the Wolds including villages such as Carnaby, Haisthorpe, Thornholme, Burton Agnes, and Nafferton, all of which are sited so as to take advantage of a ration of both heavier and lighter agricultural soils.

He was awarded the title People's Artist of Ukraine in 1978, and the Shevchenko National Prize in 1987, the highest Ukrainian award for art and literature.  Life  Zakharov was born on September 5, 1919 in Aleksandrovskoye rural settlement, a little village in the Smolensk Governorate of the Russian Empire (today part of Monastyrshchinsky District, Smolensk Oblast). He descended from a farming family. In 1935 he received a grant to study at the Kalinin Academy of Art in Moscow, where he finished his studies with distinction in 1941. Health problems kept Zakharov from being drafted for military service. He continued his art studies at the Surikov Academy of Art in Moscow. Zakharov was taught as an elite student by Aristarkh V. Lentulov, one of the best known representatives of the Russian avant garde. Zakharov started his career as an independent artist in 1950. This was the era of the totalitarian Soviet art, during which artistic expression was subordinated entirely to the interests of the Communist Party. Zakharov never created the so-called thematic paintings, which typically idealized the supposedly blissful existence of the Soviet citizenry. The young painter did not choose this path, which would have conformed to the ruling ideological system and would have guaranteed fast recognition and material advantages. Zakharov's art was inspired by the magnificent achievements of the Russian and Ukrainian landscape paintings of the late 19th and early 20th century, which are characterised by the poetisation of nature. Zakharov's landscapes and still lifes were highly admired. The paintings were exhibited in numerous art galleries and reputable museums in Kiev (Kyiv), Moscow and Leningrad (St. Petersburg). He was awarded the title National Artist of the Ukraine in 1978 and in 1987 the Shevchenko National Prize, the highest award in art and literature of Ukraine. Zakharov's paintings are greatly valued by collectors in Russia, Ukraine and Western Europe. Zakharov was particularly attracted to two landscapes. Crimea, where he lived, and the little Ukrainian village of Sedniv, close to Chernihiv, where he often traveled to paint. Taras Shevchenko, the great Ukrainian painter and poet, stayed often at the Lyzohub manor in Sedniv during the 1840s. Fyodor Zakharovich Zakharov died after a long illness in Yalta on September 29, 1994, and was buried there. In 2016 the personal exhibition of Fedor Zakharov was opened in the Hall of Yalta's Union of Artists, Crimea. The Large catalogue of his paintings was also presented during the grand opening.  Work  Prof. Olga Zhbankova, head of the department of contemporary Ukrainian art of the National Art Museum describes the work of Zakharov: \\"Zakharov's art was inspired by the magnificent achievements of the Russian and Ukrainian landscape paintings of the late 19th and early 20th century, which are characterised by the noble poetisation of nature. His paintings are based on the harmonic combination of impressionistic sentiment and illustrative painting. The freedom and naturalness of the composition combines organically with the expressiveness of the generalized forms and the strength of the harmony of light. The painter images the form of an item easily with the wide pastous stroke of his brush, reproducing the peculiarity of his fracture and the harmony of air and light.\\"  Exhibitions  File:Sacharow Stiller Mittag bei Alupka.JPGSilent Noon at Alupka, 1958, oil on carton File:Sacharow Im Hafen von Jalta.JPGYalta Port, 1959, oil on carton File:Sacharow Sonnentag in Gursuf.JPGSunny Day in Gurzuf, 1959, oil on canvas File:Sacharow St√ºrmischer Wind bei Livadia.JPGStormy Wind at Livadiia, 1964, oil on canvas File:Sacharow Sonnentag bei Sednew.JPGSunny Day in Sedniv, 1968, oil on canvas File:Sacharow Gewitterabend bei Kasantippe.JPGThunderstorm at Kazantyp, 1975, oil on carton File:Sacharow Erstes Fruehlingsgruen bei Alexanderskoje.JPGFirst Spring Green at Aleksanderskoye, 1980, oil on canvas File:Sacharow In der Werkstatt des Meisters.JPGIn the Master's Studio, 1960, oil on canvas  Literature  *Contemporary art in Russia, Index, Russian National Library.

Trouble starts when she gets paranoid that her boyfriend is cheating on her and comments that \\"they\\" told her everything. She returns home and starts to hear voices. Confused, she begins acting violently, destroying her father's computer and offending his guests during a party. Her parents Dave and Lynn take her to the hospital, where she is diagnosed with schizophrenia. They refuse to believe that she has the disorder, however, blaming Nicole's behavior on her split with Jeff. They ignore the doctor's advice and take her back home, where she admits to her younger sister Lisa that she reacted that way because she heard voices and couldn't control herself. Nicole soon returns to college, takes back Jeff and stops taking the medication she was prescribed. Soon, Nicole starts to hear voices again and becomes delusional. She ends up stopping in the middle of a freeway, stepping out of her car and panicking. Her parents agree to take her to the hospital, but are upset to find out that there is no cure, and respond angrily when she denies treatment. Lynn tries to force Nicole to take medication, but she refuses to, explaining that it makes her feel sick. However, without the medication, she has a relapse of her psychotic symptoms. Realizing what she is doing, she gives in on the pills and allows her mother to help her. Side effects include suffering from seizures, which pushes her to make the decision to quit using medication again. She pretends that she is taking the pills, but is caught by Lisa. Nicole is upset to find out that her parents are constantly arguing over the way she should be treated. Meanwhile, Lisa feels neglected by their parents and blames Nicole for acting the way she does only to get attention. After a few other outbursts, including destroying items with a knife and starting a small kitchen fire, Lynn sends her to a mental institution. Dave is opposed to this, feeling that he is abandoning his daughter. Nicole stills refuses to take pills, telling her psychiatrist that she would rather feel confused than to feel nothing at all. One night, she escapes from the institution and is nowhere to be found. During his search for her, Dave blames himself for what happened to her. After two weeks without a trace of her, Nicole is arrested for having eaten at a diner without paying. She is questioned, but initially can't remember who she is. Lynn and Lisa finally pick Nicole up and take her home, but Dave refuses to talk to her and when Lynn confronts him about it, he responds that she is too sick to notice anyway. Meanwhile, Lisa is admitted to Rochester University, but she decides not to go, much to the distress of Lynn. When Lynn confronts her, Lisa admits that she is afraid that to turn out the same way as Nicole, but Lynn assures her that that is not a possibility. In the end, Nicole tries to commit suicide by an overdose. She recovers and builds up a bond with her father again, and Lynn and Dave finally decide to work together as well to help Nicole.

The station is between Loughton and Theydon Bois. It is located in Station Approach off Chigwell Lane (A1168) and is in Travelcard Zone 6. History The station was originally opened on 24 April 1865Clive's Underground Line Guides - Central Line, dates by the Great Eastern Railway as part of an extension of the railway's Loughton branch to Epping and Ongar. Initially called Chigwell Road, it was soon renamed on 1 December 1865 as Chigwell Lane, but remained a single-platform halt for the first years of its life. It was the setting for the Victorian ballad The Chigwell Stationmaster's Wife, Chigwell station not having opened until 1903. Chigwell Lane was one of a number of GER stations that saw a temporary suspension of passenger services, due to the need to make economies during the First World War. The station was closed from 22 May 1916 until 3 February 1919. As a consequence of the 1921 Railways Act, the GER was merged with other railway companies in 1923 to form part of the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER). As part of the New Works Programme, 1935-1940, the LNER branch was transferred to London Underground, to form part of the eastern extension of the Central line. Although work commenced in 1938 it was suspended upon the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 and work only recommenced in 1946. British Railways (BR, successor to LNER after nationalisation in 1948) steam services were replaced by electric Central line passenger services on 25 September 1949. From the handover, the station was renamed Debden. British Railways goods services continued to be operated on the branch for years afterwards.Clive's Underground Line Guides - Central Line, history The station today Debden station operates as an intermediate terminus for eastbound trains from central London, and a number of peak-hours trains terminate at the station rather than continuing to Epping. A turnback siding east of the station allows eastbound trains terminating at Debden to reverse direction and enter the westbound platform to return to central London. The siding may also be used in the reverse direction, allowing westbound trains from Epping to be terminated at Debden during service disruptions and return east. At one time there were two sidings at Debden and the majority of trains terminated there with a limited service continuing to Epping. However, the Epping service has improved considerably and this has reduced the number of trains terminating at Debden. The present station buildings on the eastbound platform largely date from a reconstruction in 1974, although the original stationmaster's house survives adjacent to the ticket office. In 2018, it was announced that the station would gain step free access by 2022, as part of a ¬£200m investment to increase the number of accessible stations on the Tube. Connections London Buses routes SB09, 66A, 133, 418, 418B, and 689 serve the station.

Background  Mountain is West's first solo album after several years spent as a member of the Vagrants. The album was recorded with bassist and producer Felix Pappalardi, who shortly after formed the band Mountain (named after the album) with West; this has given it the reputation of being the band's first album.  Release and reception  The album was released on LP in July 1969 by Windfall Records. Reviewing for The Village Voice in September of that year, Robert Christgau wrote: \\"With Felix Pappalardi singing and playing bass regularly this could be New York's third supergroup. (The Rascals and the Spoonful got there first.) The visual possibilities alone‚Äîwith West, the enormous ex-Vagrant guitarist, set against the hyperactive Pappalardi, are fantastic. West plays good guitar and is a good roarer, and Pappalardi is not only first-rate on several instruments but has a wonderful singing voice, sweet and mellow. Unfortunately, he hadn't decided to join the group when this was recorded, and so participates only as bassist and producer. West alone can't quite carry it. More like early Cream than Blind Faith.\\" On April 16, 1996, Columbia/Legacy reissued Mountain on CD. In a retrospective review, AllMusic's William Ruhlmann regarded it as a rock album \\"dominated by West's throaty roar of a voice and inventive blues-rock guitar playing\\", as well as \\"an auspicious debut, instantly establishing him as a guitar hero and setting the style of Mountain's subsequent recordings.\\" Track listing # \\"Blood of the Sun\\" (Leslie West, Felix Pappalardi, Gail Collins) ‚Äì 2:35 # \\"Long Red\\" (West, Pappalardi, John Ventura, Norman Landsberg) ‚Äì 3:14 # \\"Better Watch Out\\" (Pappalardi, Collins) ‚Äì 2:47 # \\"Blind Man\\" (Collins, Pappalardi, West, Ventura) ‚Äì 3:50 # \\"Baby, I'm Down\\" (Pappalardi, Collins) ‚Äì 3:58 # \\"Dreams of Milk and Honey\\" (West, Pappalardi, Ventura, Landsberg) ‚Äì 3:22 # \\"Storyteller Man\\" (West, Pappalardi, Ventura, Landsberg) ‚Äì 3:04 # \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\" (Bob Dylan, Rick Danko) ‚Äì 3:18 # \\"Look to the Wind\\" (West, Pappalardi, Ventura) ‚Äì 2:43 # \\"Southbound Train\\" (West, Ventura, Landsberg) ‚Äì 2:57 # \\"Because You Are My Friend\\" (West) ‚Äì 3:10 Personnel *Leslie West ‚Äì guitars, vocals *Felix Pappalardi ‚Äì bass, keyboards, production *N.D.

It is one of several named for the city of Utica in Upstate New York. It runs north‚Äìsouth and occupies the position of East 50th Street in the Brooklyn street grid, with East 49th Street to its west and East 51st Street to its east for most of its path. The south end of Utica Avenue is at Flatbush Avenue; its north end is at Fulton Street, beyond which it is continued by Malcolm X Boulevard (formerly Reid Avenue) in Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant. Malcolm X Boulevard continues to Broadway, where it terminates on Broadway between Lawton Street and Hart Street. The avenue runs primarily through the neighborhoods of Flatlands, East Flatbush and Crown Heights, intersecting with other main streets such as Flatlands Avenue, Kings Highway, and Linden Boulevard. Utica Avenue is a four-lane avenue throughout its entire stretch, and an important commercial street. Public transportation Utica Avenue is served by the New York City Subway's IRT Eastern Parkway Line () at the Crown Heights‚ÄìUtica Avenue station at Eastern Parkway and by the IND Fulton Street Line () at the Utica Avenue station on Fulton Street. It is also served by the B46 and B46 SBS bus lines. =Proposed subway extension= Many proposals have been made for a subway under Utica Avenue, beginning as early as 1919. These proposals include a line suggested in 1929 as part of the IND Second System, and in 1968 under the Program for Action. In April 2015, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a new plan for building a subway line under Utica Avenue as a branch of the IRT Eastern Parkway Line to Flatbush Avenue, near Kings Plaza. The MTA Board allocated $5 million for a feasibility study, the Utica Avenue Subway Extension Study, for this proposal in the MTA's 2015‚Äì2019 Capital Program. In August 2016, it was reported that the MTA was looking into an extension of the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line along Flatbush Avenue to Marine Park, which would allow trains to serve Kings Plaza. Planning on the Utica Avenue Line stalled because it was no longer viewed as a priority by the MTA. However, planning resumed in April 2019 when New York City Transit joined city agencies in launching the Utica Avenue Transit Improvement Study. The study will look into a subway extension, improved bus rapid transit, and a new light rail line. On April 8, 2019, the MTA started to meet with local officials and survey local residents. Since the study occurred concurrently with the redesign of Brooklyn bus routes, the MTA decided to prioritize the Utica Avenue transit study.

Experience in the Colonies Once in New England, Coe and his family located for a brief time in Watertown, Massachusetts, where several other Puritan families from Boxford had located. In June 1635 Robert Coe joined a few others in starting a new plantation at Wethersfield, Connecticut, in the fertile Connecticut River Valley. He lived there for about five years where his house was situated at what is now the northwest corner of East Main and Broad Streets. A division within the church caused Robert Coe and his adherents to purchase lands for a new plantation at Stamford, Connecticut. While in Stamford he rose to become a magistrate on 5 April 1643, and to serve as a deputy to the General Court at New Haven the same year and also in 1644. Once again a dispute within the church caused Robert Coe and the Rev. Richard Denton to cross the Long Island Sound in 1644 to Long Island, then under Dutch rule. There Coe helped to establish a new settlement called Hempstead. A church was established, with Robert Coe chosen as the elder. He remained there for eight years, acquired extensive land, and was magistrate of the town under the Dutch government. Eventually Coe helped to form another new settlement, a few miles west on Long Island at a place known as Mespat, which had been previously settled in 1642 but destroyed in an Indian attack the following year. A new church was formed with Rev. John Moore as the pastor and Robert Coe the elder. The settlement took on the name of Middleburg and Hastings before being permanently named Newtown. Mr. Coe remained there for four years, being the most prominent man and local magistrate his whole time there. In 1653 he went to Boston as a deputy of the town to ask for protection from the Massachusetts Bay Colony against Indians, who were threatening attack. In November of the same year he was sent as deputy to New Amsterdam to confer with the Dutch on the same issue. From Middleburg, Robert Coe, his youngest son Benjamin Coe, and several others purchased a large tract of land south of Newtown, today Jamaica, Queens, and settled there. The Dutch appointed Robert Coe magistrate for Jamaica in 1658, an office which he held until 1664. When the English population on Long Island revolted from the Dutch at New Amsterdam and transferred their allegiance to Connecticut, Coe went along as well serving as deputy for Jamaica to the General Court at Hartford by which he was appointed commissioner (or magistrate) for Jamaica. He last served as high-sheriff of Yorkshire after governance of this portion of Long Island fell under the jurisdiction of New York. Near the end of his life, Robert Coe settled his estate among his three sons. He married a third wife, Jane Rouse, when over 80 years of age. He bought a farm of fifty acres at Foster's Meadow in Hempstead on 29 November 1678, where he lived until his death. His home on Long Island stood until 1930 when it was demolished to accommodate the construction of LaGuardia Airport.

He began working in the Boston area around 1805, when Ebenezer Craft (born 1779) commissioned Banner to build his house in Roxbury. Around 1806 to 1808, Banner supervised the building of India Wharf. In Boston he also designed the Park Street Church (1809), located next to the Boston Common.

It is very similar linguistically to the Mallorcan (mallorqu√≠) and Ibizan dialects of Catalan spoken in the Balearic islands. It also has many similarities to English and French, as well as containing anglicisms of the British rule on the island. Some examples are xoc (chalk), bo√≠nder (bow-window) or b√≤til (bottle).Balear Until the 17th century, the Minorcan subdialect had been a very uniform variant of eastern Catalan (and therefore, with few differentiating points Balearic), and today it is still in certain aspects, especially by the closure of the \\"o\\" atone in \\"u\\", which is one of the main differences that the phonetics of Menorca presents in relation to Mallorca (except for S√≥ller and its dialect, which otherwise has some points of resemblance to that of Ciutadella). A point in which Menorca remained outside the evolutionary process of continental Catalan was with the use of \\"…ô\\" tonic, which was general throughout the island. This uniformity is maintained until the end of the 19th century. From the twentieth century, the \\"…ô\\" tonic became in a closed \\"e\\" in Mah√≥n, and the same transfer was made in Alayor and Mercadal. Instead, in Ferreries and Ciutadella, the neutral sound had been maintained, partly for psychological reasons, according to the statement of Francesc de Borja Moll i Casasnovas, for the reaction of the ciutadelenses against the mahoneses, a consequence of secular antipathies. The pronunciation of the closed \\"e\\" of Mahon has been mocked by the ciutadelenses, and that has inhibited the progression of its use in the western sector of the island. Another notable difference between the cities of the island, Mah√≥n and Ciutadella, is the intonation.Ciutadella-Ma√≥. Greu vs. agut en dos parlars menorquins Not so resistant had shown the western sector of the island with the influence coming from Catalonia to Mah√≥n of the morphemes flexives -√©s, -essis, -essin. Sixty years ago, the primitive forms -√†s, -assis, -assin were substituted in Ciutadella. In the treatment of the atonic group \\"ua\\", the Menorcan follows the example of the Mallorcan and removes the last vowel, but pronouncing \\"u\\" instead of \\"o\\": aigu, llegu, Pascu. The weak \\"i\\" between vowels is lost, although in the imperfect preterite in western Menorqu√≠n, the \\"i\\" is felt, pronouncing deia, ve√≠a, etc. The deafening of the \\"ll\\" is also given: g√∫…ô (agulla), v√©…ô (vella), f√∫…ô (fulla), ur√©…ô (orella), p√°…ô (palla).

She is the former New York City Council Member for the 21st district from 2009 to 2017, which includes portions of College Point, Corona, East Elmhurst, Elmhurst, Flushing, Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Jackson Heights and LaGuardia Airport in the New York City borough of Queens. During her tenure, Ferreras-Copeland served as the chairman of the Finance Committee. She was the first woman, the first person of color, and the youngest member to be elected Finance Chair. She is a Democrat.  Early life and education  Ferreras- Copeland grew up in Corona, Queens to mother Josefina Ferreras-Palaez, an office aide who worked at the New York City Human Resources Administration, and father Julio Alejandro Ferreras, a subway car inspector at New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Her parents are both from the Dominican Republic but met in New York City at Madison Square Garden at a Fania All- Stars concert. Ferreras-Copeland graduated from John Bowne High School in Flushing, Queens. She attended LaGuardia Community College and Metropolitan College of New York.  Career  In 1999, at age 19 and after graduating from high school, Ferreras-Copeland became the director of a Beacon program housed in one of the most crowded public schools in the world, Public School 19Q. She was Assistant Director of the Community Conciliation Network in Corona, Queens. Ferreras-Copeland's political career officially commenced in 2001 when she became a Democratic National Convention delegate appointed by Assemblyman Ivan Lafayette. She then became the chief of staff and campaign manager for her then-predecessor Councilman Hiram Monserrate. She served in this position from 2001 to 2008. Ferreras-Copeland briefly left the public sector and from 2005 to 2007 served as the New York Director of the National Association of Latino Elected Officials (NALEO), working to support the NALEO Education Fund. When Councilman Monserrate became involved in a scandal (in 2012, he pleaded guilty to mail fraud), Ferreras-Copeland was among those questioned and cleared. \\"It was an experience I learned a great deal from,\\" she said. \\"It was something I overcame and was able to step into my own.\\" \\"This was a lesson learned,\\" she said, \\"especially since I worked so hard at building my name and my integrity, to have this little bit of tarnish is not something I ever want to have to face again.\\" In 2017, Ferreras-Copeland decided to leave politics and not seek re-election, returning to the private sector in order to focus on her family. New York City Council In February 2009, Ferreras-Copeland was elected to the New York City Council District 21. Ferreras-Copeland was the first Latina elected to political office in Queens. Starting in 2010, Ferreras-Copeland served as the head of the Committee on Women's Issues. While serving on this committee, in 2010 she held the first city council hearing on street harassment. After being re-elected for a second term in 2014, Ferreras- Copeland was appointed by Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito to the serve as the first woman and first person of color to Chair the City Council's Finance Committee. In this role, Ferreras-Copeland oversaw the city's $78.3 billion budget as well as the Department of Finance, Banking Commission, Tax Commission, Comptroller's Office, Department of Design and Construction and Independent Budget Office. Ferreras-Copeland was responsible for building hundreds of school seats in Corona, Jackson Heights, and East Elmhurst. Ferreras-Copeland told The New York Times that she allocated funding to build five new schools in her district and all were scheduled to open in Corona in the coming years to handle increased demand. Ferreras-Copeland developed and supported the creation of Corona Plaza, a former underutilized parking space which has been transformed in a public square. Corona Plaza, which is located at 103rd Street and Roosevelt Avenue, has become a meeting place since it was turned into a pedestrian zone in 2012. Ferreras-Copeland said the plaza has taken on the role of the central squares found in towns and cities in Latin America. \\"If you go to many of these countries, everyone comes to a centrally located plaza at some point in the day.\\" Ferreras-Copeland focused on increased transparency in the budgeting process. She improved tax exemptions to build over 15,000 affordable housing developments in New York City. She supported regulations to help small businesses that also fostered job creation. Ferreras-Copeland supported Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) and after school programs, HANAC Affordable Senior Housing, Beacon programs, Meals on Wheels, paid sick days, and tenants' rights. She is also an advocate against street harassment and gender-based violence. Ferreras-Copeland co- sponsored the paid sick leave bill, which in 2017 was expanded in 2017 to include victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking paid leave to attend to immediate safety needs. She advocated for expanded Universal Pre-Kindergarten and launched the creation of the Alliance for Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, a public-private partnership. In 2016, Ferreras- Copeland sponsored menstrual equity legislation, the first laws of this type in the United States that guarantee access to feminine hygiene products in schools, prisons, and homeless shelters. { class=\\"wikitable collapsible\\" - valign=bottom ! colspan=4  Election history - valign=bottom !

The electron can always be theoretically considered as a bound state of the three, with the spinon carrying the spin of the electron, the orbiton carrying the orbital location and the holon carrying the charge, but in certain conditions they can behave as independent quasiparticles. The term spinon is frequently used in discussions of experimental facts within the framework of both quantum spin liquid and strongly correlated quantum spin liquid. Overview Electrons, being of like charge, repel each other. As a result, in order to move past each other in an extremely crowded environment, they are forced to modify their behavior. Research published in July 2009 by the University of Cambridge and the University of Birmingham in England showed that electrons could jump from the surface of the metal onto a closely located quantum wire by quantum tunneling, and upon doing so, will separate into two quasiparticles, named spinons and holons by the researchers. The orbiton was predicted theoretically by van den Brink, Khomskii and Sawatzky in 1997-1998. Its experimental observation as a separate quasiparticle was reported in paper sent to publishers in September 2011. The research states that by firing a beam of X-ray photons at a single electron in a one-dimensional sample of strontium cuprate, this will excite the electron to a higher orbital, causing the beam to lose a fraction of its energy in the process. In doing so, the electron will be separated into a spinon and an orbiton. This can be traced by observing the energy and momentum of the X-rays before and after the collision.

Only a single example was built, which first flew in 1921 and was wrecked in 1922. Development In April 1917, the British Admiralty developed a requirement for a long-range patrol flying boat to work in support of the Fleet, and issued Specification N.3(b) (later reissued as Air Ministry Specification XXX) to meet this need.London 2003, p.62. This resulted in designs from Vickers (for the Valentia) and Shorts of Rochester, who, although better known at the time for floatplanes, had gained experience in flying boats, building Felixstowe F.3 and F.5s under licence from April 1917.Barnes 1967, p.155.London 2003, pp. 63‚Äì64. Short Brothers received an order for three prototypes just after the Armistice ended the First World War.London 2003, p.64. Short's design, the N.3 Cromarty, was a large, twin-engine biplane. It was powered by two Rolls-Royce Condor engines, and had a similar, but larger hull to that of the Felixstowe flying boats, with a biplane tail. It featured a side-by-side cockpit for the two pilots, a large box cockpit for a gunner, who was armed with a COW automatic cannon, and a dorsal position for another gunner armed with a Lewis gun.Williams and Gustin 2003, p.101. Production of the prototypes started in February 1919, but the second and third were cancelled before completion, with the first prototype eventually being launched on 21 March 1921, being first flown by John Lankester Parker on 11 April 1921. Operational history After extensive testing, the Cromarty was handed over to the RAF's Seaplane Development Flight on 17 June 1922. In August, the Flight, comprising the Cromarty, two Felixstowe F.5s and a Phoenix Cork, set out on trials of operating large flying boats away from support facilities for extended periods of time. Arriving at St Mary's, Isles of Scilly on 21 August, the Cromarty successfully weathered a storm, but was taxied onto a reef, holing the hull. The damage was declared uneconomic to repair and the Cromarty was scrapped in place.Barnes 1967, p.157.London 2003, p.65. While the Cromarty had performed well in its limited service, one problem (as with all wooden-hulled flying boats) was soakage of water into the hull, with as much as of water absorbed after a few weeks of service.Short 1925, p.825. Tests with a metal-hulled Felixstowe F.5 resulted in an order for a prototype of an improved, metal-hulled flying boat, based on the Cromarty. This became the prototype Short Singapore I.Barnes 1967, pp. 195‚Äì198. SpecificationsSee alsoNotesReferences *\\"Aircraft Production at a Glance\\".

The relationship of Bruceomyces to other taxa within the order Lecanorales is unknown (incertae sedis), and it has not yet been placed with certainty into any family. Taxonomy A monotypic genus, Bruceomyces contains the single species Bruceomyces castoris. Brucea is the original name of Bruceomyces, published by Finnish mycologist Jouko Rikkinen in 2003. Rikkinen and colleagues renamed the genus in 2012 after it was discovered that Brucea was a junior homonym of a plant genus. The generic name honors Professor Bruce McCune, who studied western North American lichen flora. The specific epithet castoris means \\"beaver\\", \\"which play an important role in the ecology of resinicolous fungi in the Pacific Northwest\\". Description Consisting of a rounded protuberance (the capillitium) at the end of a straight or curved thin brownish-black stalk, the fruit body ranges from 0.8 to 3 mm tall. The capillitum is typically 0.20‚Äì0.31 mm in diameter, while the stalk thickness is 85‚Äì135 Œºm. The thick-walled asci (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, measuring 15‚Äì20 by 7‚Äì9 Œºm, set upon stalks that are 20‚Äì25 Œºm. Spores are pale brown, ellipsoidal, and measure 7.0‚Äì8.3 by 4.4‚Äì5.1 Œºm. The spore walls have longitudinal wrinkles that can be visualized with light microscopy. Paraphyses are 2.5‚Äì3.5 Œºm thick and have thick septa (cross- walls). Bruceomyces castoris is a calicioid fungus, meaning that it releasing a powdery spore mass (the mazaedium) on the surface of the apothecium. Habitat and distribution Bruceomyces castoris was isolated from the sap and chewed wood found in beaver teeth scars at the base of living grand fir trees in a wooded area by a beaver pond in Polk County, Oregon.

During the 18th century the mine produced enormous amounts of copper ore and was very wealthy, but from the later 19th century onwards was not profitable. Today the site of the mine is part of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site. Geology The country rock at the mine was killas and the mine's main product was copper, though arsenic and tin were also produced. There are several lodes at the mine, some of which were crossed by an elvan dyke, 15 to wide which in places was highly mineralized.Dines (1956) p.389 Early history There were probably mine workings in the area of Wheal Busy since the 16th century, but it was not until the 1720s that the mine started to produce large amounts of copper ore. The principal landowner was the Boscawen family.Kain, Roger & Ravenhill, William, (eds.) (1999) Historical Atlas of South-West England, Exeter, p.293. The mine was located in what was known at the time as \\"the richest square mile on Earth\\". During its life it produced over 100,000 tons of copper ore, and 27,000 tons of arsenic. The mine adopted the name of Wheal Busy after 1823.Collins (1912) p.219 At one time the mine also smelted the copper ore it produced.Collins (1912) p.650 =Steam engines= The mine suffered badly from underground water and in order to pump it out, one of the first Newcomen engines in Cornwall was installed by Joseph Hornblower in 1727.Barton (1966) p.16 In 1775 this was replaced by a 72-inch engine designed by John Smeaton which was not very effective and was rebuilt by James Watt in 1778, making it one of the first Watt steam engines in the county.Barton (1966) pp.20‚Äì22 Also in 1778, the mine benefited from being connected to the Great County Adit, which also helped drainage. 1850 onwards To celebrate a restarting of the mine in 1856, a \\"gargantuan feast\\" was held in the village of Chacewater. Watched by crowds, a thousand people marched through the village to the mine where the cornerstone for a large new engine house was laid. There was an excursion train on the West Cornwall Railway, a church service, a dinner was provided for 400 poor people, and at night there was a firework display. The feast itself took place in the marketplace and involved the roasting of a whole ox. Although large quantities of copper and tin ore were produced in the following ten years, no overall profit was made and the adventurers lost more than ¬£150,000 in the mine.Barton (1968) pp.44‚Äì45 In 1866 there was a wave of sabotage by some of the miners against the adventurers when in an attempt to reduce the mounting losses, a new mine captain imposed what amounted to a tax on their earnings. According to newspaper reports at the time the miners set about \\"attempting to blow up the boilers, laying trails of [gun]powder about the barracks, setting fire to the clothes in the dry, throwing large pieces of iron in the pumps, and other villainous acts.\\" The mine closed down shortly afterwards.Barton (1968) p.47 In the 1850s the water drawn from the mine was being used for the steam engines, but it was so corrosive that each year six of the twenty four boilers had to be renewed. It was not until 1862 that a supply of clean water was arranged to solve this problem.Barton (1966) p.116 The last significant production of copper ore from the mine was in 1866 (1,630 tons), though it sold small amounts (less than 100 tons) in each of the following three years.Burt et al. (1987) p.66 In 1873, in the middle of the slump in copper prices, the mine was reopened and a new 90 inch pumping engine was purchased from Perran Foundry, despite there being many second-hand engines cheaply available at the time. Only seven months after it started work the engine was up for sale and the mine had closed without producing any ore at all.Barton (1966) p.71 Brunton calciner In around 1910 the mine installed a second-hand 85 inch pumping engine, and to help with its production of arsenic, a Brunton calciner was built. In the 1920s a set of Californian stamps was installed to rework the waste dumps for ore. During the Second World War, 2,500 American GIs were billeted on the site and were said to have restarted the 85 inch pumping engine.Hancock (2008) p.64 Present day Today, the site is within area A6i (The Gwennap-Chacewater Mining District) of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site. There are good remains of the Brunton calciner, and the concrete bases of the Californian stamps are prominent. The Mineral Tramways cycle path passes the mine. The mine has been listed as a scheduled monument since 11 March 1974. Many of the buildings on the mine property have been listed as Grade II buildings: the engine house and arsenic calciner on 21 November 1985, the chapel for the mine on 14 April 1999, and the mine's smithy building on 7 December 2004. In 2011, it was determined that many of the mine's building were in need of restoration. Natural England's Higher Level Stewardship agreed to fund work on the engine house and associated buildings in 2014, and the project was completed in the summer of 2015. However, while the smithy building was also in need of work, the agency was not able to fund its restoration, but it was hoped there would be other means of funding the restoration of this building.

Probably descended from the Skeltons of Armthwaite Castle, Cumberland, Bevil Skelton began his career as a colonel in the British Army, eventually rising to the position of Lieutenant-Colonel of the Royal English Regiment in France from 1672 to 1674. Secretary to King Charles II, Skelton spent many years roving between German courts in his capacity as envoy. In March 1685 he became ambassador at the Hague, but it was not, by all account, a successful posting; Skelton was rabidly pro-French, and his hatred of the Dutch was legendary. He quickly 'rendered himself the contempt of the Hollanders.'James Granger, 'Sir Bevil Skelton, 1678', A Biographical History of England, W. Richardson, 1806 In October 1686 he was appointed envoy-extraordinary to France. It was the hope of James to make an ally of France against the Dutch, who he feared would aid William of Orange if he attempted to usurp James's crown. Louis XIV, however, was well aware of the English King's intention, and declared that, was an attempt by England made to poison France against the Dutch, 'he would act as if his own crown was attacked.' James was forced to publicly deny the charge of insincerity towards Holland, and hastened to find a scapegoat ‚Äì Skelton became that man. Recalled to England, Skelton was imprisoned in the Tower - a mere token gesture, as he was released soon after and made Lieutenant of the Tower on 26 November 1688. The Glorious Revolution, only a few weeks later, shortly deprived him of this office. He followed James into exile and continued to be one of his leading diplomats, becoming envoy to the court at Versailles and comptroller of the royal household at Saint-Germain- en-Laye. Due to his long-standing Royalist connections, Skelton became a significant hate figure for Williamite supporters after the Revolution, and the subsequent Whig demonisation of him has tended to colour history's view of the man. Gilbert Burnet condemned him as \\"a very weak and passionate man, who neither understands the conduct of affairs, nor can govern his tongue with any sort of temper; for as his passion carries him to fly out on all occasions, so his vanity is so little governed that he discovers all sorts of secrets, even when he can have no other design in it but to let it appear that he knows them\\". Skelton was married twice; first to Simona Cary (d. 1687), daughter of Sir Ferdinando Cary and stepdaughter of Sir Thomas Blackwell, then in 1692 to Marie O'Brien (d. 1747), daughter of the 3rd Viscount Clare. His portrait from life was engraved by M. van Sommeren in 1678. Cites \\"Noble's Continuation of Granger's Biogr. Hist. i. 159\\".

Most Sierra Leonean Mandingo are the direct descendants of Mandinka settlers from Guinea, who settled in the north and eastern part of Sierra Leone, beginning in the late 1870s to the 1890s under the rule of prominent Mandinka Muslim cleric Samori Ture. Also later a significantly large population of Mandinka from Guinea migrated and settled in Eastern Sierra Leone and Northern Sierra Leone in the early to mid 20th century. The Mandingo people of Sierra Leone have a very close friendly and allies relationship with their neighbors the Mandingo people of Guinea and Liberia, as they share pretty much identical dialect of the Mandingo language, tradition, culture and food. The Mandingo constitute about 6.9% of Sierra Leone's population. The Mandingo are over 99% Muslim, adherents to the Sunni tradition of Islam. Islam has become the basis of their religious and cultural practices. The Mandingo are well known for their conservative Islamic tradition. The Mandingo people of Sierra Leone are predominantly traders and rural subsistence farmers. Some very prominent and well-known Mandingo in the country have been political leaders, including Sierra Leone's former president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, former Vice President Sorie Ibrahim Koroma, current Sierra Leone First Lady Fatima Maada Bio (nee Jabbie), current chairman of the Sierra Leone national electoral commission Mohamed Nfa Alie Conteh, former Sierra Leone minister of trade Usman Boie Kamara, current Sierra Leone minister of Energy Ibrahim Kanja Sesay, current Sierra Leone National Security Adviser Mohamed Mamadi Keita, former Sierra Leone Information Minister Kanji Daramy,. BBC journalist Umaru Fofanah, SLPP politician Ibrahim Kanja Sesay, Sierra Ambassador to the United Nations Alie Kabba, and Makeni Mayor Sunkarie Kabba Kamara. The Mandingo people of Sierra Leone speak the mandinka language as their native language. Like other Sierra Leonean ethnic groups, virtually all of the Mandingo people in this country also speak the Krio language. In the 21st century, the Mandingo live in virtually all parts of Sierra Leone; they make up the majority of the population of several towns in the North and East of Sierra Leone. Their population is largely concentrated in Koinadugu District in the North, particularly in the towns of Kabala and Falaba, where they form the majority of the population. The Mandingo make up the majority of the population in Yengema, Kono District in Eastern Sierra Leone. They also make up the majority of the population in the town of Karina, Bombali District, in the north of Sierra Leone. History Samori with the Qur'an in his hands In 1875, Samori Ture, an ultra conservative hardline Muslim cleric and Mandinka leader in Guinea, imported breech-loading rifles through the British colony Sierra Leone and supplied his warriors with them. By 1876, his Mandinka warriors had enslaved many African Tribes within the region, including the Limba led by Almamy Suluku and had conquered a large territory in Limba areas in northern Sierra Leone (present day Koinadugu and Kambia District). The Mandinka warriors moved into the northeastern part of British colony Sierra Leone, where they occupied lands of the local indigenous Temne and Loko people. Ture took the title of Imam, chief of all Believers. By late 1876, the Mandinka warriors had occupied a large section in northeastern Sierra Leone, possibly due to wars with France and intentions to spread the teachings of Islam. Samori Ture established Islamic rule in parts of Northeastern Sierra Leone under his control, as part of the Wassoulou. He founded many Islamic Madrassa schools based on the Suffi tradition of the Maliki school within Sunni Islam. Ture ordered the local Sierra Leonean people, who were living under the Mandinka control territory in Northeastern Sierra Leone to abandon their animist beliefs and to convert to Islam or they must pay a tax known as Jizya for not converting to Islam. Samori Ture brought many ethnic Mandinka marabout Sunni Muslims clerics from the Sufi tradition of Islam from Guinea to Northeastern Sierra Leone to teach the Quran and the life of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. Ture banned some indigenous practices by the local Sierra Leone people that he viewed as un Islamic. Ture also imposed an Islamic dress code in Northeast Sierra Leone under his rule. Although most part of Northern Sierra Leone had been Muslims even before Samori's conquest, A minority of the local Sierra Leonean people under Samori Ture's rule were not Muslims at the time. But faced with the tremendous powers of the new hardline Muslim rulers, they abandoned their animist beliefs and converted to Islam. Many of the local peoples joined the Mandinka in enrolling in the Islamic Madrassa schools established by Samori Ture. Within a short period of time after Ture conquered part of northern Sierra Leone, part of the region, once dominated by Indigenous religion, rapidly became an overwhelmingly Muslim majority, and has remained an overwhelmingly Muslim majority to present. In 1878, Ture sent thousands of Mandinka people from the Wassoulou in central Guinea to Mandinka-occupied northeastern Sierra Leone as traders, farmers, and settlers to colonize the area. By late 1878, the Mandinka population had tripled in British-controlled Sierra Leone. By the late 19th century, many of the Mandinka had begun to have large families. And by 1900, most of the Mandinka population in Sierra Leone were first generation Sierra Leonean born. The British government considered the Sierra Leonean born Mandinka as citizens of the colony of Sierra Leone by birth. The British called them Mandingo. While they were concentrated in the North and East, the Mandinka traders and businesspeople also settled in the capital Freetown. Since the late eighteenth century, it had been dominated by the Krio people, an ethnic group made up of descendants of black colonists from Great Britain and Nova Scotia, and slaves liberated from ships by the British Navy. The settlers from Nova Scotia were mostly freed United States slaves (known as Black Loyalists who were resettled in Nova Scotia after the American Revolutionary War. Many had left rebel masters and joined the British to gain freedom. Politics The Mandingo have played an important role in the politics of Sierra Leone. The Mandingo have traditionally supported the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), which ruled the country as recently as 2007. Sierra Leone's third president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, who is ethnic Mandingo, was very popular in the Mandingo community across Sierra Leone during his presidency. During Kabba's administration, the Mandingo enjoyed strong influence in the government and the civil service. *Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, President of Sierra Leone from 1996 to 2007 *Sorie Ibrahim Koroma, Vice president of Sierra Leone (1971 to 1985) *Alhaji Chief A.MucktarruKallay, First chairman and Leader of the All Peoples Congress (APC) Mar-Oct1960. *Usman Boie Kamara, an ethnic Mandingo, ran unsuccessfully for the SLPP presidential candidate in the 2012 Sierra Leone presidential election. He finished second, after the former military ruler Julius Maada Bio, who won the SLPP nomination at the party's convention held on 31 July 2011 at the Miatta Hall in Freetown. . Under the current Sierra Leone government of president Ernest Bai Koroma of the All People's Congress (APC), serving since 20xx (year), several prominent Mandingo have been appointed to senior government and civil service positions. These include deputy Minister of Finance, Mabinty Daramy; Ambassador to the Gambia Mohamed Kemoh Fadika; and Minister of Mines, Mineral Resources Minkailu Mansaray; Mandingo culture Mandingo culture is rich in tradition, music, and spiritual ritual. Mandingo continue a long oral history tradition through griots, who tell stories, songs and proverbs. This passing down of oral history through music has made music one of the most distinctive traits of the Mandinka. In rural areas, western education's impact is minimal; the literacy rate in Latin script among these Mandinka is quite low. But, more than half the adult population can read the Arabic script used locally; small Qur'anic schools for children are quite common. The Mandingo have long been known for their drumming and also for their unique musical instrument, the kora. The kora is a 21-stringed guitar- like instrument made out of a halved, dried, hollowed-out gourd covered with cow or goat skin. The strings are made of fishing line. It is played with traditional songs to accompany a dying person into the meaning of death, so the deceased can go in peace to the phantom place. Customs Most Mandinka live in family-related compounds in traditional rural villages. Mandinka villages are fairly autonomous and self-ruled, being led by a council of upper-class elders and a chief who functions as a first among equals. =Marriage= Family members traditionally arrange marriages between prospective spouses. This practice is particularly prevalent in the rural areas. The suitor's family sends kola nuts, a bitter nut from a tree, to the male elders of the bride-to-be. If the gift is accepted, the courtship begins. The Mandinka have practiced polygamy since pre-Islamic days. A Mandinka man is legally allowed to have up to four wives, as long as he is able to care for each of them equally. Mandinka believe the crowning glory of any woman is the ability to produce children, especially sons. The first wife has authority over any subsequent wives. The husband has complete control over his wives and is responsible for feeding and clothing them. He also helps the wives' parents when necessary. Wives are expected to live together in harmony, at least superficially. They share work responsibilities of the compound, cooking, laundry, etc. =Passage into adulthood= Mandingo children are named on the seventh day after their birth, and are almost always named after a very important person in their family. The Mandinka practise rites of passage to mark the beginning of adulthood for their children. At an age between four and fourteen, the children of each sex are subjected to ritual cutting of genitalia (see articles on male and female genital cutting), in separate groups according to their gender. In years past, the boys spent up to a year in the bush, but that has been reduced to coincide with their physical healing time. It is now generally between three and four weeks. The children who have been through the ritual together form a special, internal bond, one which remains throughout life. During this time, the children of each gender are taught about their adult social responsibilities and rules of behaviour by elders of the same gender, who become their lifelong sponsors. They learn secret songs about being Mandinka. These songs teach them how they are to relate to members of the opposite sex, including their parents, their siblings, their relatives, and eventually their spouses, as well as their elders and their peers. Great preparation is made in the village or compound for the return of the children. A huge celebration marks the return of the new adults to their families. The children are given new clothes and treated with new respect by their elders. Boys and girls are honoured with a dance. Tradition teaches children that, even after marriage, a woman's loyalty remains to her parents and her family; a man's to his. Religious and spiritual beliefs In the early 21st century, more than 99% of Mandinka are Muslim. Many Mandinkas children, particularly those in the rural areas who attend madrassas, learn to recite chapters of the Qu'ran in Arabic. Most Mandinka continue to practise a mix of Islam and traditional animist practices. They believe that the spirits can be controlled only through the power of a marabout, who knows the protective formulas. No important decision is made without first consulting the marabout. Marabouts, who also have Islamic training, write Qu'ranic verses on slips of paper and sew them into leather pouches. They sell them as protective amulets, which are bought and worn by men, women, and children. The few Mandinka who have converted to Christianity are often viewed as traitors by the others. Often communities drive out converts from the compound and village; they are rejected by their families. Economy Mandinka are rural subsistence farmers who rely on groundnuts, rice, millet, and small-scale husbandry for their livelihood. The oldest male is the head of the family. Small mud houses with conical thatch or tin roofs make up their villages, which are organized on the basis of clan groups of related individuals. During the rainy season men plant peanuts as their main cash crop; peanuts are also a staple of the Mandinka diet. Men also plant millet and corn, mostly for family consumption. Women work in the rice fields, tending the plants by hand. This is extremely labour-intensive and physically demanding work. Only about 50% of the rice consumption needs are met by local planting; the rest is imported from Asia and the United States. While farming is the predominant profession among the Mandinka, men also work as tailors, butchers, taxi drivers, woodworkers, metalworkers, soldiers, nurses, and extension workers for aid agencies. However, most women, probably 95%, remain in the home as wives and mothers because their labor is integral to the survival of families.

The crater was discovered in January 2008 during the first flyby of the planet by the MESSENGER spacecraft. It contains a large (), nearly circular pit crater. See unnamed feature 2. Multiple examples of pit craters have been observed on Mercury on the floors of impact craters, leading to the name pit-floor craters for the impact structures that host these features. Unlike impact craters, pit craters are rimless, often irregularly shaped, steep-sided, and often display no associated ejecta or lava flows. These pit craters are thought to be evidence of shallow volcanic activity and may have formed when retreating magma caused an unsupported area of the surface to collapse, creating a pit. They are analogs of Earth's volcanic calderas. Pit-floor craters may provide an indication of internal igneous processes where other evidence of volcanic processes is absent or ambiguous. The discovery of multiple pit-floor craters augments evidence that volcanic activity has been a widespread process in the geologic evolution of Mercury's crust.

Founded in 1990, the festival was created with the intention of finding ways to present the history of music in innovative ways to contemporary audiences. To this end, each year the festival selects a single composer to be its main focus and presents performances in tandem with presentations on biographical details on the subject and links to the worlds of literature, painting, theater, philosophy, and politics that would have influenced the life and works of the featured composer. The effort to bridge the worlds of performance and scholarship often results in a variety of concert formats and styles that often depart from the typical recital and concert structure. Concerts are frequently presented with informative preconcert talks, panel discussions by renowned musicians and scholars, and other special events. In addition, each season a book of essays, translations, and correspondence relating to the festival‚Äôs central figure is published by Princeton University Press. The festival is currently led by Artistic Directors Leon Botstein, Christopher H. Gibbs, and Robert Martin. The festival's first featured composer was Johannes Brahms in 1990. The recent 2015 festival focused on the world and works of Carlos Ch√°vez.

Neither of these works had been very successful (despite the cachet of W. S. Gilbert as librettist for the latter), so Workman decided to follow the prevailing tastes of the London public by presenting an Edwardian musical comedy for his third production. Unlike previous Savoy Theatre premieres, and except for Workman and Cunningham, the cast consisted of musical comedy performers and comedians who had neither appeared at the Savoy nor had previously been connected with the D'Oyly Carte organisation.Wearing, J. P. The London Stage, 1910‚Äì1919: A Calendar of Plays and Players, The Scarecrow Press (1982) Two Merry Monarchs opened on 10 March 1910 to an enthusiastic public, but it received mostly poor notices. Despite a lavish production and the skill of the performers concerned, Two Merry Monarchs was withdrawn from the Savoy stage on 23 April 1910, after 43 performances, one of the shortest runs of any Savoy opera.The Times, 10 March 1910, p. 10; and 23 April 1910, p 14. Producer Austen Hurgon picked it up for an attempt at a low-price season of musical comedy at the Strand Theatre, and the production was transferred in whole with the same cast, scenery and costuming, beginning on 30 April 1910. Added to the cast were provincial musical comedy star Philip Smith as Rolandyl and West End leading-man Hayden Coffin as Prince Charmis.The Times, 2 May 1910, p. 8 But the death of King Edward VII on 6 May forced all theatres to be closed for a week in mourning, and Two Merry Monarchs closed after only six performances there. There was a provincial tour, in which Coffin participated, in the late summer of 1910. When the Strand reopened in September, Two Merry Monarchs was gone from the bill.

Workman, and Lennox Pawle Act I - A laburnum-hung Courtyard outside the Royal Palace of Esperanto A tocsin-bell summons the populace, who rush out to hear the king's herald, Helvanoise, announce a new law: Kissing is now forbidden for one year under penalty of banishment. Those who wish to continue to kiss must purchase a kissing license from Rolandyl, the Post-Master General. Princess Iris has known about the law for the past three days because she is engaged to the Post-Master General. Princess Cynthia, King Paul's adopted daughter, is in love with Prince Charmis, the Governor of Police. They agree to keep their engagement a secret and do not get a kissing license. The public is incensed about the new law, and led by Caroline, they protest the edict on the steps of the palace. King Paul justifies his decision to enact the law, and when the crowd does not accept his argument, he weeps them into submission. King Paul tells his life story to Rolandyl. Nine hundred years ago, King Paul was an alchemist who discovered the Elixir of Life, and when he drank it, he became immortal. His bonehead assistant stole some of the Elixir and drank it as well. Twenty years ago, King Paul betrothed the adopted daughter of the late King to the King of Utopia, who comes to Esperanto today to claim his affianced bride. King Paul has brought up Princess Cynthia on slow poisons so that she may take a heavy dose of poison without feeling the effects. King Paul plans to get her to kiss the King of Utopia, and he will barter crown and country for an antidote, then King Paul will rule throughout the world. Meanwhile, Helvanoise is furious to learn that Iris has been flirting with Rolandyl. King Paul tells Cynthia about her betrothal, and when she begins to cry, he gives her an \\"extra special sweet\\" to make her feel better. King Utops of Utopia arrives, accompanied by Mandamus and the King's Bodyguard. Princess Cynthia is presented to him, and when he tries to kiss her hand, Charmis interrupts him and informs him that he must get a license before kissing anybody. Act II - The Reception Room inside the Royal Palace of Esperanto. Evening. Charmis has called in the constables to act as flunkeys in case of any disturbance this evening. He swears he will protect Cynthia from King Utops at any cost. Six ladies-in-waiting are late for the ball, so Mandamus will not admit them. They press Helvanoise to choose a girl from the six of them, but he declines to make a selection. The ballroom guests appear with Iris, who tells the ladies where they might get a kissing license, even though the men show no interest in purchasing one. Iris decides that when Cynthia and Charmis announce their engagement, she will announce her engagement to the Post-Master General. King Utops works his charm on Cynthia, and when he moves to kiss her, Charmis interrupts them again. Utops produces his license - a license to sell wines and consume liquor on the premises! Utops complains to Paul that Rolandyl sold him the wrong license, and that he doesn't like Charmis hanging around Cynthia. King Paul orders Rolandyl to set up his office in the reception room and sell licenses to the public. Utops finally kisses Cynthia, but when Utops fails to respond to the poison, he admits that he was Paul's assistant when he discovered the Elixir of Life. The world isn't big enough for two immortal kings, so they decide to fight a duel, in which they drink from two glasses. One is filled with water, the other is filled with a liquid which makes the drinker mortal. So that there is no cheating, Charmis and Mandamus are summoned to supervise the duel. King Paul tells Charmis about the Elixir and explains that he still has a phial in his cabinet. Charmis is to get the phial and bring to him at once. Unbeknownst to them, Charmis mixed the drinks while the kings were blindfolded, and when they drink, they are both in the cart. Charmis returns with Cynthia and everyone, saying that they drank the Elixir and will live forever as King and Queen of Esperanto. Mandamus is appointed King of Utopia, Utops becomes his Lord Chief Justice, and Paul becomes Charmis' Governor of Police. Helvanoise is named the new Post-Master General, and when Rolandyl tries to speak to Iris, she reminds him that she will marry the Post-Master General, who is now Helvanoise. The kissing law is repealed, and the happy couples leave Rolandyl, Utops and Paul disconsolate. Roles and Original Cast Alma Barber and C.H.

Critical reaction Press reports were mostly negative in tone. The Morning Post wrote, \\"The new musical piece produced at the Savoy Theatre differs in character from the productions for which the house was famous in the past.\\"The Morning Post, 11 March 1910 The press praised the acting and singing of all concerned, as well as the presentation, but they took strong exception to the story and the music. The Times stated that the musical \\"lacks several elements which are requisite to make a good comic opera\\". The paper pronounced the music \\"not very distinguished\\" and concluded its review, \\"When one was not regretting Gilbert, one was regretting Sullivan; and when one ceased for a moment to regret Sullivan, one regretted Gilbert.\\"The Times, 11 March 1910, p. 10 The Era declared \\"The story becomes less easy to follow as the play proceeds; indeed, it serves as a thread on which to string musical numbers, dances and dialogue.\\"The Era, 11 March 1910, p. 21 The Daily Telegraph was similarly unimpressed, saying \\"the composer falls below the level of accomplishment one might have reasonably expected. There are numbers in the piece, however, which seem to point to his possession of a gift for facile melody. ... The scoring throughout is decidedly thin even for musical comedy.\\"The Daily Telegraph, 11 March 1910. The Sunday Times even hinted at plagiarism: \\"The music was tuneful in parts, sometimes strangely familiar.\\"The Sunday Times, 13 March 1910. The Observer commented that the contribution of the costume designer, Percy Anderson, outshone those of the composer and librettists.The Observer, 13 March 1910, p. 8 The Evening Standard and St. James's, however, praised the music, saying \\"It is not extraordinary, but neither is it commonplace except occasionally. He does not write particularly well for the voice, but he has, generally, originality and is always melodious. Some of his songs, not the purely sentimental ones, are fresh, \\"catchy\\", well-written and full of tune.\\"Evening Standard & St. James's, 11 March 1910 NotesReferences Coffin, Hayden (1930).

Alkali basalt or alkali olivine basalt is a dark-colored, porphyritic volcanic rock usually found in oceanic and continental areas associated with volcanic activity, such as oceanic islands, continental rifts and volcanic fields. Alkali basalt is characterized by relatively high alkali (Na2O and K2O) content relative to other basalts and by the presence of olivine and titanium-rich augite in its groundmass and phenocrysts, and nepheline in its CIPW norm.  Geochemical characterization  Depiction of the total alkali-silica diagram. Alkali basalts are generally located in the upper left corner of the basalt region (region B). Alkali basalt is chemically classified as a rock in region B (basalt) of the total alkali versus silica (TAS) diagram that contains nepheline in its CIPW norm. Basalts that do not contain normative nepheline are characterized as sub-alkali basalts, which include tholeiitic basalts and calc-alkaline basalts.  Petrography  The groundmass of alkali basalt is mainly composed of olivine, titanium-rich augite and plagioclase feldspar and may have alkali feldspar or feldspathoid interstitially, but is poor in silica minerals, such as hypersthene and quartz. Phenocrysts are ubiquitous in alkali basalt and, similarly to the groundmass, are usually made up of olivine and titanium-rich augite but can also have plagioclase and iron oxides with lower frequency.  Geologic context  Alkali basalt can be found in areas associated with volcanic activity, such as oceanic islands (Hawaii, Madeira, Saint Helena, Ascension, etc.), continental rifts and volcanic fields. Continental alkali basalt can be found in every continent, with prominent examples being the Rio Grande Rift (USA), the East African Rift and the Pali-Aike volcanic field. The results from the gamma ray spectrometer on Venera 8 on Venus suggest it landed on alkali basalt.

He was an Indian artist who was a founding member of the Calcutta Painters. He lived and worked in relative obscurity until retrospective exhibitions of his work in Kolkata, New Delhi and Bombay brought him to India‚Äôs national attention in 2005.The Great Indian Art Boom, Indian Art in 2005, Matters of Art As a child, Rabin Mondal witnessed the devastating effects of the 1943 Great Bengal Famine and the pre-Partition riots that ravaged the state. These incidents have since translated onto his canvases, mirroring the horror and suffering of the people Early life and family  Mondal was born in Howrah, an overcrowded urban extension of Calcutta. His family had prospered in business in the late 19th century. Rajendra Narayan Mondal (1792 to 1860), Dewan of Narayanganj in Bengal was an ancestor, and one of his sons Rajendranarayan received the title of Raja. The narrow lane where Rabin‚Äôs paternal home stands was named after his grandfather Fakirdas Mondal. But the pressures of an extended Bengali household forced the young Rabin to live with not only his brothers and sisters, but also his aunts, uncles, great aunts and uncles, and also his cousins. Though the Mondal family had a highly educated and upper-middle-class background, Howrah was known for its overcrowded slums and impoverished migrant workers who toiled in various grimy industries. It was an environment that caused the young Rabin to take note of the realities of life and its struggles.After the Fall, The Life and Times of Rabin Mondal, Santo Datta, Delhi Art Gallery, 2005, Like many Indian artists of his generation, Rabin was deeply affected by the Bengal famine of 1943, the struggle for India's independence, and the subsequent partition of his native Bengal.Old Images, New Ideas, Gayatri Sinha, The Hindu, 30 September 2005 In May 1976, Rabin marriedIn memoriam: Rabin Mondal, Sudeshna Banerjee, The Telegraph, 12 July, 2019 Bani Mitra, also an artist by profession, and 18 years younger than Rabin. The couple settled down in their Howrah residence but eventually moved to Salt Lake in 1996 when a bunch of artistes formed a co-operative society and was granted a 14-cottah plot by the then finance minister of West Bengal, Ashok Mitra. It was around this time that Bani was diagnosed with cancer. She passed away in 2000. The couple had no children. Education and career Rabin Mondal graduated in Commerce from Calcutta University in 1952. His first formal education in art was at the Indian College of Art and Draughtsmanship, Calcutta. He continued his artistic studies at the Asutosh Museum of Indian Art of the University of Calcutta.Manifestations II, Rabina Karode, Delhi Art Gallery 2004, In 1964 Rabin and what is now known as the \\"Group of Eight\\", (which consisted of Nikhil Biswas, Prokash Karmakar, Bijan Chowdhury, Gopal Sanyal, Bimal Banerjee, Mahim Rudra, Gunbritt Svensson and Mondal himself) formed the Calcutta Painters. This lively group of artists worked to promote modernist art not only in Calcutta, but throughout India, becoming nationally known in the process.Calcutta Painters, www.calcuttapainters.com Rabin's Unfinished Work Mondal worked out of his Howrah studio, churning out a series of \\"kings\\" and \\"queens\\" painted with oil on canvas. These are perhaps Mondal‚Äôs best known works, depicting tragic looking figures, seemingly suffering from paranoia and fear, yet ironically termed kings and queens. Some of the highlights of this series were the works Man Acting as King, King Being Appeased, King Making Confession, and King and his Assassin. Mondal also produced a series of \\"deities\\", which sometimes seem to merge thematically with his \\"queens\\". The artist‚Äôs deities are generally depicted with radiate crowns, whereas his kings and queens are not. Other favorite subjects of the artist were the brothel and the harem, which he depicted in canvases such as Event in Red Light Area and Orgy. \\"Animal\\" - Acrylic on Board, 1993 Though some of Mondal‚Äôs best canvases have an obvious cubist influence, stylistically his work has been predominantly expressionist, a reaction to the tormented humanity that surrounded him in Calcutta, and the tragic events of his formative years. Rabin Mondal‚Äôs work can be found in the collections of The National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi, Osians Art Archive, Mumbai, The Birla Academy of Art and Culture, Kolkata, and the Jane and Kito de Boer Collection, Dubai.

Based on the 1995 novel The Invisible Circus by Jennifer Egan, the film is about a teenage girl who travels to Europe in 1976 in search of answers to her older sister's suicide. During her search, she falls in love with her dead sister's former boyfriend. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 11, 2001, and was released in the United States on February 2, 2001. Plot In 1976 San Francisco, Phoebe O'Connor is plagued by the mystery surrounding the death of her free-spirited older sister, Faith, who left the United States for Europe when Phoebe was 12 years old, and was subsequently found dead at the base of a precipice in Portugal. Faith's death was ruled a suicide, but Phoebe is skeptical of this claim. Against the wishes of her mother, Gail, Phoebe departs for Europe hoping to uncover more information about the last year of Faith's life. In Amsterdam, she tracks Faith's boyfriend, Wolf, an Englishman who left San Francisco with Faith. Wolf blames Faith's suicide on drug use, thrillseeking, and a hedonistic lifestyle; he recalls his last moments with Faith in July 1970, when she decided to travel to Berlin to join the Red Army Faction. After Phoebe has a disturbing vision of Faith in the street, she is invited by Wolf to stay with him and his wife, a French woman named Claire. Wolf recollects Faith's eagerness to be engage in radical political protests, including terrorism, which frightened him. Phoebe, wanting to see where her sister last lived, plans to travel to Portugal. Wolf, though initially reluctant, agrees to accompany her on the trip. Soon, their relationship turns romantic. Phoebe and Wolf make their way to the seaside village where Faith died. When they arrive at the cliffside where Faith died, Wolf further elaborates on Faith's terrorist involvement with the Red Army Faction, including a bomb detonation in Berlin which resulted in the death of an innocent man. Upon reuniting with Faith in Portugal, Wolf found her riddled with guilt, and she made him promise to never tell her family that she was responsible for a man's death. In the midst of a nap on the beach, Wolf awoke to Faith standing on the edge of a rock wall along the cliff. Though he attempted to coax her back, he was unable to stop her from leaping to her death. Phoebe and Wolf embrace, and light a candle for Faith in a nearby cathedral.

Sheepshanks then moved to Canada as a missionary, working in British Columbia at the time of the Cariboo Gold Rush. He was responding to an invitation in 1859 from George Hills, the Bishop of Columbia and formerly a fellow-curate under Hook at Leeds. Sheepshanks was made Rector of New Westminster. Since New Westminster was then little more than a forest clearing on the banks of the Fraser River, this was a rugged life. He was also chaplain to the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment. He returned to England in 1864, to raise funds, via San Francisco and Utah; his church had burned down by the time he reached New Westminster in 1866. His father then fell ill, and planning to visit him, Sheepshanks set off once more; the trip turned into an extended Pacific and Asian journey. Returning finally to England via Moscow in November 1867, Sheepshanks settled down to life as a parish priest.

He supported votes for male agricultural workers, suffragan bishops (his diocese had 900 parishes), and the ultimate division of the Diocese of Norwich.

It was resolved unanimously that the formation of a Rugby Football Society was desirable and thus the Rugby Football Union was formed. A president, a secretary and treasurer, and a committee of thirteen were elected, to whom was entrusted the drawing-up of the laws of the game upon the basis of the code in use at Rugby School.

He returned to Dresden in 1882, where he founded the magazine Der Kunstwart, the leading publication channel of the German culture reform movement, which was dedicated to aesthetic education as well as to love to culture and nature. Avenarius married Else Doehn divorced Schumann. His father-in-law, Dr. Rudolf Doehn, was a German writer and an American representative in Missouri. In 1895, Schilling & Graebner built a first villa for Avenarius in Blasewitz, where he lived with his wife and his step-son Wolfgang Schumann.

It was first proven in 1985 by Mikhail Gromov. The theorem states that one cannot embed a ball into a cylinder via a symplectic map unless the radius of the ball is less than or equal to the radius of the cylinder. The importance of this theorem is as follows: very little was known about the geometry behind symplectic transformations. One easy consequence of a transformation being symplectic is that it preserves volume.D. McDuff and D. Salamon (1996) Introduction to Symplectic Topology, Cambridge University Press . One can easily embed a ball of any radius into a cylinder of any other radius by a volume-preserving transformation: just picture squeezing the ball into the cylinder (hence, the name non-squeezing theorem). Thus, the non-squeezing theorem tells us that, although symplectic transformations are volume-preserving, it is much more restrictive for a transformation to be symplectic than it is to be volume- preserving.  Background and statement  We start by considering the symplectic spaces : \\\\mathbb{R}^{2n} = \\\\\\\\{z = (x_1, \\\\ldots , x_n, y_1, \\\\ldots , y_n )\\\\\\\\}, the ball of radius R: B(R) = \\\\\\\\{z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{2n}  \\\\z \\\\ < R \\\\\\\\}, and the cylinder of radius r: Z(r) = \\\\\\\\{z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{2n} ~~ x_1^2 + y_1^2 ~~ < r^2 \\\\\\\\}, each endowed with the symplectic form : \\\\omega = dx_1 \\\\wedge dy_1 + \\\\cdots + dx_n \\\\wedge dy_n. Note: The choice of axes for the cylinder are not arbitrary given the fixed symplectic form above; namely the circles of the cylinder each lie in a symplectic subspace of \\\\mathbb{R}^{2n} . The non-squeezing theorem tells us that if we can find a symplectic embedding œÜ : B(R) -> Z(r) then R ‚â§ r.  The ‚Äúsymplectic camel‚Äù  Gromov's non-squeezing theorem has also become known as the principle of the symplectic camel since Ian Stewart referred to it by alluding to the parable of the camel and the eye of a needle.Stewart, I.: The symplectic camel, Nature 329(6134), 17‚Äì18 (1987), .

The Robertson‚ÄìSchr√∂dinger‚ÄìHeisenberg inequality states that: :var(Q) var(P) \\\\geq cov^2(Q,P) + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2}\\\\right)^2 with Q and P the canonical coordinates and var and cov the variance and covariance functions.Maurice de Gosson: How classical is the quantum universe? arXiv:0808.2774v1 (submitted on 20 August 2008)  References  Further reading  * Maurice A. de Gosson: The symplectic egg, arXiv:1208.5969v1, submitted on 29 August 2012 ‚Äì includes a proof of a variant of the theorem for case of linear canonical transformations * Dusa McDuff: What is symplectic geometry?, 2009 Symplectic geometry Theorems in geometry ","title":"Non-squeezing theorem"},{"id":"23825058","text":"Howard James \\"Sandy\\" Elliot (d.

Dangerous Girls has won awards, including the ALA Quick Pick for Reluctant Young Adult Readers and the New York Public Library Book for the Teen Age. In the novel, Renz, a vampire, bites Destiny Weller at Camp Blue Moon. Afterwards, she and her twin sister Livvy return home in Dark Springs with a craving for blood. Destiny's father cures Destiny, but is unable to cure Livvy, who, together with Ross, changes into a blackbird and flies off into the sky.  Background  At the time of publication, R. L. Stine was 59 years old and had already authored over 330 books for children and young adults, including the Fear Street and Goosebumps series of books. Published in the 1990s, both his Fear Street series, which was oriented towards young adults, and his Goosebumps series, oriented towards children, were successful, with the Goosebumps series selling more than 300 million books. Stine had both series on hiatus while writing other novels. Living in New York City, Stine recalls walking a dog in a park, when the title for the novel flashed into his mind. He says he started thinking of what the 'Dangerous Girls' would be, thought of vampires, and \\"sort of went from there.\\" Stine was excited about the book as it gave him the chance to write for teenagers again. Stine did research to follow existing vampire lore but admitted to adding \\"good vampires\\" who would restore victims. Dangerous Girls was first published in 2003 by HarperCollins Publishers in hardcover. On August 31, 2010, it was published together with its sequel in the book Bitten.  Plot  During summer break, at Camp Blue Moon, the vampire Lorenzo \\"Renz\\" Angelini sinks his fangs into the throat of sixteen-year-old Destiny Weller. Afterwards, she and her twin sister Livvy return home in Dark Springs with a craving for blood; they feed on a rabbit's blood and Destiny sucks blood from a package of liver. While at the house of a family friend, Coach Bauer, the sisters meet Marjory Bauer, another vampire. Marjory says she is undead and the Restorer can restore their life. At Dark Springs High School, in Renz's office, Destiny talks with him and decides he is the Restorer. She asks him if he will help her and her twin. He says that he will come and take care of her at the senior overnight. Back at her house, Destiny greets her friend Nakeisha Johnson, who tells her Renz was left out of the camp yearbook and there are no photos of him. From this, Destiny determines that Renz is actually a vampire and not the Restorer. During the senior overnight, Destiny meets Renz, shoves a wooden tent pole through his body and kills him. Her father appears, and tells her that he is the Restorer. He cures her, and they go and find Livvy and her friend Ross Starr at the edge of a grassy clearing. Livvy tells Destiny and her father that she has been immortal since camp, and that she and Ross exchanged blood. Livvy and Ross change into blackbirds, and fly off into the black sky.  Reception and sequel  In 2004, Dangerous Girls was selected as a New York Public Library Book for the Teen Age and listed as an American Library Association (ALA) Quick Pick for Reluctant Young Adult Readers. The paperback edition was published in 2004 () and listed as a 2005 ALA Popular Paperback for Young Adults. Rachel Manija Brown of Green Man Review stated that there is nothing new or original, poignant, or interesting about the novel and that it is \\"just lifeless, cranked-out pages by a writer on autopilot.\\" Kimberly L.

Organization The gendarmerie is organized in battalions, whose component companies and platoons are dispersed to individual communities and desert outposts. Its regional headquarters are in the same cities as the six military regional headquarters with subdivisions in the forty-eight wilayat. It consists of a General Headquarters in Algiers and 6 subordinate Regional Commands (Divisions), plus 4 commands for Recruitment & Training, Intelligence, Administration and Detection. The 6 Regional Commands each command 3 to 4 \\"Brigades\\". Several specialized units also exist within the gendarmerie, and were established to confront the increase in crimes and criminals: * Administrative Unit * Aerial Training Formation * Border Guards Unit, created on November 17, 1977 * Cultural Heritage Protection Unit * Environmental Protection Unit * Juvenile Protection Brigade, created in 2011 * Security and Intervention Detachment * Special Intervention Detachment, created on August 27, 1989 Equipment A highly mobile force, the gendarmerie possesses a modern communications system connecting its various units with one another and with the army.

In the late 1800s the mining industry moved in and established the area. The Blue Bird Mine Complex was a silver mine from that era and it can still be seen in the park today. During the summer months, recreational visitors would come to visit the area via the railroad. In the 1930s, the area was used to breed Arabian horses by Lynn W. Van Vleet. Then in 1971, the land was purchased and one of the barns was converted into the Caribou Ranch recording studio.

The project was first introduced by New York Islanders owner Charles Wang. The base of the project was a newly renovated Coliseum for the New York Islanders to play in. Surrounding the Coliseum would be houses, offices, restaurants, and various stores, as well as Long Island's first five-star hotel. There would also be an athletic complex, conference and exhibition facilities, and a minor league baseball ballpark. The Lighthouse Project was expected to take 8 to 10 years to be completed, and to cost about $3.74 billion. The investors expected the project to generate $71 million of annual tax revenues, and create about 75,000 construction and construction-related jobs. After the project's completion, 19,000 new permanent jobs were expected to be created. Many believe the project's approval would have been the only way that Wang would have kept the Islanders on Long Island, rather than selling or moving the team. However, Nassau County residents voted against building a new arena for the Islanders on August 1, 2011.  Proposal  These banners are displayed along the outside of Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, promoting the Lighthouse Project. The Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum was currently the second-oldest arena in active use by an NHL team (after Madison Square Garden), and had the second smallest capacity of all arenas in the NHL (after MTS Centre). Nassau County asked for and received proposals from different development groups regarding how to renovate and build up the coliseum and surrounding area. Islanders owner Charles Wang proposed a plan to develop the area surrounding the arena; his plan originally included a renovation of the Coliseum, a 60-story tower designed to look like a lighthouse, housing, athletic facilities, a new minor league baseball stadium, restaurants, and a new hotel, at a projected overall cost of approximately $200 million. On August 14, 2007, Charles Wang and the Lighthouse Development Group, partnered with Rexcorp, created a new plan downsizing the entire project. The Coliseum design changed considerably, and the 60 story \\"Lighthouse\\" was replaced with two 30-story buildings connected by a footbridge.  2009‚Äì14  In February 2009, local media speculated that Charles Wang, frustrated with the slow pace of obtaining approval for the project from the Town of Hempstead, would consider relocating the team. The team will be eligible to move when its lease with Nassau County ends in 2015. The Islanders played a 2009 preseason game in Kansas City, Missouri, which was considered a possible candidate for relocation. There was also a movement to have the Islanders play adjacent to Citi Field, the home ballpark of the New York Mets baseball team, in the Willets Point section of Queens should the team leave Nassau County. Wang has said that he wants the team to remain where it is, but has also said that he would be forced to explore other options if significant steps were not made by the Town of Hempstead in regard to approving the project by October 2009. Local newspapers such as Newsday and the Daily News speculated that Wang would consider moving the team to an area such as Queens or Brooklyn, where Barclays Center was then being built for the New Jersey Nets basketball team.http://www.islanderspointblank.com/2009/09/brooklyn-calling-on-the- islanderssource-nyi-wanted-to-join-nets-in-barclays-centre/ Financing documents for the arena released in December 2009 indicated that ‚ÄúThe New York Islanders could potentially become a tenant‚Äù at the Barclays Center. The Islanders' agreement with the New York Rangers allows them to relocate anywhere on Long Island, including Brooklyn and Queens. In May 2009, Newsday reported that Wang had subsidized the team by $208.8 million, an average of $23 million per year since buying it, beyond what he paid for it. After the October 2009 deadline passed, the Long Island Press reported the cancellation of the Lighthouse Project. Wang has denied the report. In May 2010, Mets COO Jeff Wilpon had discussions with Wang about constructing a new arena for the Islanders near Citi Field. Wilpon has also discussed the possibility of buying the Islanders. In June 2010, the website FanHouse reported that Jeff and Fred Wilpon, the owner of the Mets, began working with real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle (who is also working on the renovation of Madison Square Garden) on a feasibility study of a new Islanders arena in Queens. However, a source from Newsday indicated that the FanHouse report was not true.http://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/news/story?id=5286305 There were also reports that businessman Nelson Peltz wanted to buy the Islanders and move them to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. On July 12, 2010, Town Supervisor Kate Murray (R-Hempstead) announced an ‚Äúalternate zone‚Äù created for the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum property, downsizing the original Lighthouse Project to half its proposed size and making the project, according to Nassau County Executive Ed Mangano and the developers, \\"economically unviable for both the developer and owner of the site.\\" From this point, the Lighthouse Project would no longer be pursued by Wang, Mangano and the developers. On May 11, 2011, the Islanders and Nassau County executives announced that county residents would vote on a referendum for taxpayer funding for a new arena for the New York Islanders on August 1; on that date, county voters rejected a proposal for a new arena to replace the Nassau Coliseum. On October 24, 2012, it was formally announced that the New York Islanders would be moving to Barclays Center in Brooklyn following the expiration of their lease after the 2014-2015 season.

After the death of Edward I in 1307, discontent soon developed against the new king. This was partly due to lingering problems from the previous reign, but also related to issues with Edward II himself. Particularly his abandonment of the Scottish Wars and his patronage of the unpopular Piers Gaveston caused discontent. Drawn up in Boulogne-sur-Mer during the king's nuptials, the document vaguely asserted the signatories' duty to guard the rights of the Crown. Three months later, the agreement was the basis for another document, justifying opposition to the king. This latter document, the so-called Declaration of 1308, is notable for its use of the \\"doctrine of capacities\\": the distinction between the person of the King and the institution of the Crown. The document today exists only in a 17th-century transcript by the antiquarian William Dugdale. The Boulogne agreement was largely unknown to modern historians up until the 1960s, but it is now considered significant because it is the first documented expression of the conflict between king and nobility, which was to dominate so much of the reign of Edward II. Though historians agree on the document's importance, there is still disagreement over its interpretation, particularly whether the signatories should be seen as oppositional or loyal to the king. Background Edward II succeeded as king of England on 7 July 1307, on the death of his father Edward I. The expectations of the new king were high, and he initially enjoyed a good relationship with the leading magnates of the realm. There were, however, some issues of contention remaining from the reign of his father. Edward I's incessant wars had put a great fiscal burden on the country, and his confrontational style had led to conflict with some of the leading lay and ecclesiastical lords. This had culminated in the drafting of the so-called Remonstrances in 1297, a set of complaints about royal government. By Edward I's death in 1307, most of these issued had been resolved. It was nevertheless in the interest of the leading men of the country to make sure that the new king did not act the way his father had, and ignored the opinions of his councillors. There were also certain personal issues regarding the new king that caused concern. Shortly before his death, Edward I had exiled Prince Edward's favourite and possible lover Piers Gaveston, whom the king believed had too much influence over the prince. At his deathbed he had supposedly exhorted some of his closest followersHenry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke and Robert Cliffordto keep watch over his son, and particularly to make sure that Gaveston did not return. One of Edward II's first actions as king was nevertheless to recall Gaveston from exile. He also gave him the title of Earl of Cornwalla title normally reserved for members of the royal familythereby furthering the aggravation against the favourite. Another source of discontent was Edward II abandoning the Scottish Wars pursued by his father. This left the way open for Robert the Bruce to regain land the English had conquered, to the detriment of many English magnates. On 22 January 1308, Edward II left England for France, leaving Gaveston behind as Regent. By the Treaty of Montreuil in 1299, it had been agreed that Edward should marry Isabella, the daughter of Philippe IV of France. Accompanying the king were several great nobles, including Lincoln, Pembroke, Clifford, John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey and Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford. On 25 January Edward and Isabella were married at Boulogne-sur-Mer, and on 31 January Edward performed homage for the Duchy of Aquitaine, which the English king held of the French king. On that same day, the nobles mentioned above, with others, gathered to sign the document that has become known to history as the Boulogne agreement. Document and interpretation Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, was the oldest and most respected among the earls of Edward II. The document was signed and dated at Boulogne on the 31 January 1308.Anglo-Norman: \\"Escrites a Boloigne le darrein jour de Janver l'an de Grace MCCC et septisme\\". \\"septisme\\" (seventh) refers to the legal year, which did not begin until 25 March. At the top of the list of signatories was Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham and Patriarch of Jerusalem. He was followed by the four earls Lincoln, Pembroke, Surrey and Hereford, and five men of baronial families: Clifford, Payn Tybetot, Henry de Gray, John de Botetourt and John de Berwick. The document today exists in the Bodleian Library in Oxford, as a transcript made by the 17th-century antiquarian William Dugdale. Dugdale's transcript is believed to be based on an older document, which was probably lost in the Cotton library fire of 1731. The text of the document is rather vague and noncommittal. The signatories were concerned with guarding the king's honour and the rights of the Crown (garder son honeur et les dreits de sa Corounne). There was also a promise to address and correct both the things that had been done against that honour and those rights, as well as the past and present oppression of the people (). Nothing is said about what specifically these things were, but it must be assumed that the target was Gaveston. Bek was given the authority to excommunicate whoever broke the terms of the agreement. Because of the vague language of the document, there has been much scholarly debate over how it should be interpreted. John Maddicott saw the wording as a hostile warning to the new king to avoid the mistakes of his father, or face the consequences. J. R. S. Phillips, on the other hand, took the signatories to be positively inclined towards Edward II. There were others who were more intrinsic in their opposition to the king and Gaveston, primarily the Earl of Warwick. The purpose of the document, in Phillips view, was to present the king with a warning, and hopefully protect him against the more antagonistic members of the nobility. Aftermath and transmission The Boulogne agreement had little immediate impact, and is notable mostly for its influence on a later document presented in parliament in April that year. In the meanwhile, on 25 February, the king had been crowned. Before the coronation, the king had been forced to include an additional clause in his coronation oath. The king obliged himself to abide by the law, but this exact meaning of this promise was ambiguous. The clause referred to laws the people \\"shall have chosen\\" (), which left it unclear whether it also included future enactments. At the coronation ceremony that followed, Gaveston acted with such presumption and arrogance as to further alienate the leading magnates. The document from the April parliament, today referred to as the Declaration of 1308, contained three articles and was presented by the Earl of Lincoln.The full text of this document can be found in: The first article invoked the so-called \\"doctrine of capacities\\": that the subjects of the realm owed allegiance to the institution of the Crown, not to the person of the King. If the King abused his position, it was his subject's duty to correct this, thereby upholding the pledge of the Boulogne agreement to protect the rights of the Crown. The second article was an attack on Gavestonthough he was not mentioned by nameimplicitly demanding his renewed exile. The third article referred to the additional clause from the coronation oath. It was here taken to mean that the king had obliged himself to abide by any decisions made by his subjects; past, present or future. The king initially held out against the opposition, but the earls also received support from Philippe IV, who was offended by Edward's apparent preference of Gaveston over Isabella. On 18 May Edward agreed to once again send Gaveston into exile. Dugdale both transcribed the Boulogne agreement and made a reference to it, in a footnote in his 1675 Baronage of England. After this the document was absent from history writing for almost three centuries. Dugdale's footnote was mentioned by certain historians, but it was not until 1965 that the document itself was again used as a source, when No√´l Denholm-Young quoted a few lines from it in his History and Heraldry: 1254-1310. In 1972, J. R. S. Phillips printed a complete transcription of the Boulogne agreement in his book Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke 1307-1324.

The roots of this political theory can be traced back to the years shortly after the Norman Conquest. Here the distinction was made between the ecclesiastics in their temporal and spiritual capacities. When William the Conqueror brought a case against his brother Odo of Bayeux, Odo defended himself by claiming that as a bishop he could not be prosecuted by lay authorities. William replied that he was not being prosecuted in his capacity as bishop, but in his temporal capacity as Earl of Kent. In the reign of Edward I, the principle was applied to the chancellor, to distinguish between his official capacities. Even more significantly, Edward I himself tied the doctrine to the institution of the monarchy, when he tried to revoke a grant he had made as prince after he became king, claiming that he was to be considered a different person then. In April 1308, in a document presented in parliament, certain barons used the doctrine of capacities to justify opposition against King Edward II. The specific case revolved around King Edward's favourite Piers Gaveston, whom the opposition wanted exiled. This Declaration of 1308 argued that it was the subjects' duty to protect the dignity of the Crown, even if that meant opposition to the Kingan act that would normally signify treason. In 1321, however, the opposition against Edward II took the opposite position when they accused Hugh Despenser the Younger of his participation in the Declaration of 1308. By this accusation the doctrine was largely discredited, and rarely used again in the medieval period.

In 1917 he got a position as sixth form master and Head of Department of Civics at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle. For a period Davies worked in government administration, as Secretary of the Government Hospitality Fund and other departments, from 1918 to 1929. He was also an editor at the Public Record Office, before being appointed Consultant Archivist at the Monmouthshire County Council, where he established the Monmouthshire County Record Office. During World War II, from 1941 to 1945, he was an archivist at the National Library of Wales. After the war he taught palaeography and diplomatic at Cambridge. He also held honorary positions, such as honorary editor of the Historical Society of the Church in Wales, and honorary consulting archivist to the Church in Wales. Davies is today best known for his work on late medieval English administrative history, particularly the reign of Edward II. In his 1918 book The Baronial Opposition to Edward II: Its Character and Policy, a Study in Administrative History, he argues that the administration of Edward II, though politically a failure, saw several important innovations in the field of royal administration, particularly through the influence of the king's favourite Hugh Despenser the Younger, and his father Hugh Despenser the elder. The book came out shortly after Thomas Frederick Tout's The Place of the Reign of Edward II in English History (1914), which covered much of the same area.

This is a highly variable species with a wide distribution, and it often hybridizes with other Lewisia species, making identification difficult. In general, this is a petite perennial herb growing from a taproot and caudex unit, and producing a basal rosette of several leaves 2 to 8 centimeters long. The leaves are narrow but thick and fleshy, blunt-tipped, and linear to lance-shaped. The inflorescence is usually made up of a few very short stems each bearing one or more flowers which appear to be sitting on or within the basal leaf rosette.

It strives to become a platform for exploring the ties between artistic creativity and dramatic social issues such as war, dislocation, exile, and artistic suppression.

One of the most characteristic ballets of Les Ballets Persans‚Äô repertoire and the company's signature work; Femme (2003, music: Hossein Alizadeh), is a one-act contemporary piece on the eternal unity of man and woman. The technically demanding pas de deux reflects the sorrow of Iranian women through the centuries: their beauty, femininity and untiring campaign for freedom and equality. At the finale, a new era arises: the era of enlightenment. The man and the woman are united but as equals. Based on a tale from Shahnameh, Kaveh-The Blacksmith (2004, music: Ahmad Pejman) is another heroic ballet about the old blacksmith who led the rebellion of the people against the tyranny of the evil king ZahhƒÅk.

Vis and Ramin (2011, music: Peyman Soltani) was staged during the 3rd biennial of Tirgan Festival in Toronto, Canada (The largest Iranian festival in the World). The story is based on the poems of Fakhruddin As‚Äôad Gurgani (11th century Persian poet), an epic mythical love story between two young lovers that sacrifice name, family and social obligations for each other. Created for the National Ballet of Tajikistan as the company's first contemporary piece, Symphony of Elegy (2012, music: Alexander (Ali) Rahbari) is a metaphorical contemporary ballet based on the roots and rituals of lamentation and elegy in the Iranian culture. Recital of an elegy is mainly a performing tradition based on Shahnameh called ‚ÄúNaghƒÅli.‚Äù In this dramatization, the storyteller dies in sorrow of reciting the elegy.

Notes *The Iranian Azerbaijan is not to be mixed with the Republic of Azerbaijan. While the Iranian province of Azerbaijan is a region in northwestern Iran, the Republic of Azerbaijan is an independent state bordering the Iranian Azerbaijan province. The Republic of Azerbaijan belonged to the Iranian territorial domains until 1812, when the region was lost to Russia after a short war and through the Treaty of Gulistan. The region, ruled by different khanates, were incorporated into the Russian Empire in 1813. Azerbaijan Democratic Republic proclaimed its independence in 1918 after the breakdown of the Russian Empire following the Bolshevik revolution but lasted only 23 months until the Bolshevik 11th Soviet Red Army invaded it. The country was then incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1920 as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. After the collapse of the Soviet Union the country gained its independence in 1991. *The Azerbaijan People's Government, established in Iranian Azerbaijan and headed by Ja'far Pishevari as its president, was a communist puppet state and a short-lived government in northern Iran from November 1945 to November 1946. After the reentering of the Iranian Army to Tabriz, the capital of the proclaimed Azerbaijan People's Government, many of the leaders including Ja'far Pishevari took refuge in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. Pishevari, who was never fully trusted by Stalin, soon died in a car accident under mysterious circumstances. The movement was kept alive in Azerbaijan SSR during the entire Soviet era and was reactivated after the Islamic Revolution in Iran. A large number of former members and activists of the Firqah-i Dimukrat, or Azerbaijani Democratic Party which was behind the formation of the Azerbaijan People's Government migrated to Western countries after the fall of the Soviet Union. The Azerbaijanian separatist movement in Stockholm consists of sympathizers of the Pishevari movement.

Nazi career  Jost joined the Nazi Party on 2 February 1928 with an NSDAP membership number of 75,946. He performed various functions for the party's operations in southern Hesse. From 1930 he settled as an independent lawyer in Lorsch, Hesse. After the Nazi seizure of power in March 1933, Jost was appointed Director of Police in the city of Worms and then to police director of Giessen. From this period came his association with Werner Best, who brought Jost into the main Nazi intelligence and security agency, the Sicherheitsdienst (SD). On 25 July 1934, Jost began his full-time career with the SD. His SS membership number was 36,243.

Best lost a power struggle with Heydrich who went on to become one of the most powerful men in the Nazi state. In March 1942, Jost was fired from his position as Chief of Ausland-SD.Doerries, Hitler's Last Chief of Foreign Intelligence, pp. 21, 80. Jost's place was taken by Brigadef√ºhrer Walter Schellenberg, a deputy of Heydrich. Heydrich had given Schellenberg the task of building up a case for Jost's removal. According to Schellenberg, Jost was lacking in bureaucratic skill and drive. Jost was sent to command Einsatzgruppe A, whose previous commander Franz Walter Stahlecker, had recently been killed in a battle with partisans. Einsatzgruppe A was then operating in the Baltic States and in Belarus. Jost became Befehlshaber der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD (Commander of the Security Police and the SD) or BdS in Reichskommissariat Ostland, with his headquarters at Riga. Jost retained this position until September 1942. According to Jost, this position carried substantial responsibility: During the time the territory under his jurisdiction was subject to army control, Jost as Chief of Einsatzgruppe A cooperated with the army command. When the territory came under civilian administration, he, as Commander in Chief of Security Police and SD received his orders from the Higher SS and Police Leader Friedrich Jeckeln. In both cases Jost was responsible for all operations conducted in his territory. After his Einsatzgruppen command, Jost was able to secure a position with the occupation administration for the eastern territories that was run by Alfred Rosenberg, where he acted as a liaison officer between Rosenberg and the Wehrmacht commander in southern Russia, Ewald von Kleist. At his later trial, Jost claimed that he held this position until May 1944, when as a result of enmity from Heinrich Himmler, he was forced to enlist with the Waffen-SS as a second lieutenant. Himmler decided in January 1945, that Jost should be retired from the SS with a pension.  Trial and conviction Otto Ohlendorf (foreground), and Heinz Jost (background), as defendants in the Einsatzgruppen Trial. In April 1945, Jost was arrested in Gardelegen, in Saxony-Anhalt, and was charged with murders committed by Einsatzgruppe A. At trial (the 9th of the twelve, in toto, trials convened, known as the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials), Jost tried to avoid responsibility for these crimes, by claiming the murders (or at least some of them) occurred before he came into command of the unit: This defense was rejected by the tribunal: Jost also claimed, through his attorney, that whatever he had done was justified by \\"self-defense, necessity, and national emergency\\". He further claimed he had nothing to do with carrying out the F√ºhrer's order (F√ºhrerbefehl) for the extermination of entire populations. These claims were rejected by the tribunal as being inconsistent with each other: \\"If, as a matter of fact, the defendant committed or approved of no act which could be interpreted either as a war crime or crime against humanity, the argument of self-defense and necessity is entirely superfluous.\\" Jost did testify that when in May 1942 he received an order from Heydrich to surrender Jews under 16 and over 32 for liquidation, he placed the order in his safe and declined to transmit it. The tribunal found the evidence contradicted him. According to Einsatzgruppen status report number 193, dated 17 April 1942, there was an execution in Kovno [Kaunas], on 7 April 1942, of 22 persons \\"among them 14 Jews who had spread Communist propaganda\\". In addition, the tribunal found, that on 15 June 1942, one of Jost's subordinates wrote to the RSHA, requesting shipment of a gas van (used by the Einsatzgruppen for executions by means of carbon monoxide asphixiation) and gas hoses for three gas vans on hand. Jost denied any knowledge of this letter but admitted that the subordinate in question had the authority to order equipment. His sentenced was reviewed by the \\"Peck Panel\\". In 1951, Jost was released from Landsberg prison. He then worked in D√ºsseldorf as a real estate agent. He died in 1964 at Bensheim.

It was written as a prequel to her first published work that takes place on the actual Sartorias-deles, Crown Duel. Synopsis In this much-anticipated prequel to Crown Duel, Vidanric Renselaeus, fifteen-year-old Marquis of Shevraeth, finds himself sent across the continent to a military academy in Marloven Hess, a kingdom known for its violent history. Vidanric is used to civilized life in pleasant Remalna‚Äîexcept that the evidence is increasingly clear that the civilization is only on the surface. Too many young, smart heirs have suffered accidents of late, and the evidence is beginning to point to the king, Galdran, who has grandiose plans for expansion. In Marloven Hess, no one can pronounce his real names, and they assume his title is his name. He becomes Shevraeth‚Äîdiscovering that there are no marquises or dukes or barons in this kingdom, and no one has the slightest interest in Remalna. Or in foreigners. Until very recently, the academy was closed to outsiders. But the king‚Äîalso fifteen, and recently come to his throne after a nasty civil war‚Äîwants him there. Learning about command turns out to be very different from what Shevraeth had assumed, and the Marlovens, who are going through political and social change at all levels, are not at all what he expected. He makes friends as well as enemies; experiences terror and laughter as well as challenges on the field and off. He discovers friendship, loyalty‚Äîand love. All the while greater events in the world are moving inexorably toward conflagration, drawing the smartest of the young people into key positions‚Äîwhether they want it or not.

Among positions of esteem, he was elected president of the Behavior Genetics Association (1982), and was executive editor of the society's journal Behavior Genetics. In honour of this role, the society maintains an annual Fulker Award, for the best paper in the journal each year, and for which the award is \\"$1000 and a decent bottle of wine\\". Contributions to behaviour genetics In 1970, Fulker and John L. Jinks published a proposal that the biometric genetic approach should be applied to human behaviour.Jinks JL & Fulker DW. (1970). A comparison of the biometrical-genetical, MAVA and classical approaches to the analysis of human behavior. Psychological Bulletin, 73, 311‚Äì349. Seemingly a commonplace idea today, this was a landmark paper, and became a citation classic. At the Institute of Psychiatry, Fulker's research established that many behaviours, not only in rodents but also in humans and in such \\"higher\\" mental traits as personality and also psychiatric diseases show genetic influences. Producing these results entailed the development of novel analytical approaches, on which Fulker collaborated with John DeFries. Fulker worked on combining quantitative and molecular genetic approaches, adapting the DeFries‚ÄìFulker regression approach to this purpose. With a former PhD student Lon R. Cardon (who went on to discover linkage for dyslexia on chromosome 6 and to work in the human International HapMap Project) and Stacey S. Cherny, Fulker worked on methods for linkage and association analysis of quantitative traits. Career Fulker's father had been a miner in Wales, but moved the family to London, where Fulker grew up. He was initially trained as a teacher, and working in this profession (teaching chemistry) and as a photographer. Fulker subsequently obtained a BSc in psychology at Birkbeck College, London University, graduating with first class honours, and deciding to work in genetics. Fulker pursued this interest, obtaining both a Masters and a PhD at Birmingham University supervised by John Jinks. Exceptionally for a post-graduate student, his first publication (on fruit fly mating) was published in Science in 1966. Fulker joined the staff at Birmingham as a lecturer where he remained until moving in 1975 to a senior lectureship at the Institute of Psychiatry in London, where he also directed its animal laboratories at the Bethlem Royal Hospital. In 1985 Fulker moved to a professorship at the University of Colorado's Institute for Behavioral Genetics at Boulder. In 1996, he was recruited back to the Institute of Psychiatry to the new Medical Research Council funded Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Research Centre. Fulker was married to Angela Elliott with whom he had one child, Rosanna, born in 1985 and a stepdaughter, Katherine.

The fire covered about of which was forest; it destroyed 7.3 million hectares (18 million acres) of forest, including one-sixth of China's entire timber reserves. About 266 people were wounded and 211 died in the fire leaving 50,000 homeless. It was one of the largest wildfires ever to occur, and the largest to strike China in over 300 years.  The fire  The fire originated in the coniferous Da Hinggan Forests in the Greater Khingan Range, a mountain range in northeastern China. In 1987, the area surrounding the Amur River in the region had been unusually hot and was experiencing a drought, leading to an overabundance of parched vegetation. These conditions were ideal for a large wildfire to occur. Because the area was sparsely populated at the time, the exact cause of the fire was not very clear at first; any small ignition could have turned into a major firestorm in the conditions present. Later and widely believed Chinese reports state that the fire was started \\"when an untrained 18-year-old worker accidentally ignited gas spilled from his brush cutter.\\" According to Harrison Salisbury, the roots of the disaster lay in excessive cutting down of trees without any effort to let the forest regrow, which triggered multiple fires in the region. Whatever the causes were, the resulting firestorm quickly gained momentum, fueled by high winds in the region. Workers reported their truck engines stopping as the fire deprived the oxygen supply in the air as well as burning projectiles raining down on them ahead of the fire. A total of 191 people were killed by the fire, and a further 250 were left injured. In addition, 33,000 Chinese were made homeless.  Response  Although both countries were affected heavily by the fire, China and the Soviet Union responded very differently. China, despite its shortage of advanced firefighting equipment, sent over 60,000 soldiers and workers to try and put out the fire. Because the forest was a major source of wood for China as well as the fact that it was close to the Gobi desert and thus a factor in desertification in northern China, China spent much effort on extinguishing the flames. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, simply let the fire burn out on its side of the border because its vast timber reserves were not seriously threatened by the fire. When the fire finally stopped over a month later, the differences in responses were clear: The Soviet Union had lost more forest (15 million acres compared to 3 million in China), while China was more devastated economically. In the aftermath, China punished individuals for causing the fire; the aforementioned 18-year-old worker, along with his employer, were jailed. The forestry minister was fired. In addition, a local fire chief who saved his house and left the rest of his town to burn was sentenced to four years in prison. In the Soviet Union, despite Glasnost, the public was never informed of the huge disaster. The lessons learned from the Black Dragon fire helped to improve response to wildfires throughout the world, as well as demonstrating the impact that governments can have on the environment. The effect that the fire had on the environment in the region generated new found concern and speculation about the future about the forest's ecology.

A restored Lombard steam log hauler at Clark's Trading Post in Lincoln, New Hampshire The Lombard Steam Log Hauler, patented 21 May 1901, was the first successful commercial application of a continuous track for vehicle propulsion.Alvin O. Lombard, Logging Engine, , granted May 21, 1901.Alvin O. Lombard, Log Hauler, , granted May 21, 1907.Auman (1984) p.99 The concept was later used for military tanks during World War I and for agricultural tractors and construction equipment following the war. Description Alvin Orlando Lombard was a blacksmith building logging equipment in Waterville, Maine. He built 83 steam log haulers between 1901 and 1917.Auman (1984) p.100 These log haulers resembled a saddle-tank steam locomotive with a small platform in front of the boiler where the cow-catcher might be expected. A steering wheel on the platform moved a large pair of skis beneath the platform. A set of tracked vehicle treads occupied the space beneath the boiler where driving wheels might be expected. The locomotive cylinders powered the treads through a gear train. The log haulers mechanically resembled 10- to 30-ton snowmobiles with a top speed of about .Holbrook (1961) pp.77-80 Operation While the ground was covered with snow and ice, a log hauler could tow a string of sleds filled with logs. Each sled train required a crew of four men. An engineer and fireman occupied the cab behind the boiler, and a steersman sat on the platform in front. A conductor rode on the sleds with a bell-rope or wire to signal the crew in the cab.Holbrook (1961) p.78 The earliest log haulers pulled three sleds, and later models were designed to pull eight sleds. Each train carried 40,000 to 100,000 board-feet of logs. The record train length was said to be 24 sleds with a total length of . The greatest operational difficulty was on downhill grades where ice allowed the sleds to accelerate faster than the engine. Jack-knifing sleds pushed many log haulers into trees, and most photos of log haulers show rebuilt cabs and bent ironwork on the boiler and saddle tank. Hay was spread over the downhill routes in an effort to increase friction under the sleds, but hungry deer sometimes consumed the hay before the train arrived. The steersman was regarded as the hero of the crew. In sub-freezing temperatures down to 40 degrees below zero, he sat in an exposed position in front of the train. Sparks flying out of the boiler stack above him would sometimes set his clothing afire as avoidance of trees required his full attention and effort turning the clumsy steering wheel. Some steersmen earned enough money to purchase fire-resistant leather clothing. Some log haulers had a small roofed shelter built on the steering platform, but the shelter limited the steersman's ability to jump clear when collision became inevitable, and few were able to avoid injury from the following trainload of logs. Berlin Mills Company was one of the larger woods operators to use Lombard log haulers. They purchased one machine in 1904, and then purchased two more to maintain reliable operation when one needed repairs. The company maintained a single iced haul road in Stetson, Maine, by nightly application of water from a sprinkler sled, and strung a telephone line with frequent call boxes to dispatch sled trains over that road. The company estimated those three Lombard log haulers did the work of 60 horses.Holbrook (1961) pp.78-9 History The first two Lombard log haulers were used near Eustis, Maine, in 1901 prior to construction of the Eustis Railroad. These early machines had an upright boiler and were steered by a team of horses. Most of the Lombard log haulers were used in Maine and New Hampshire. A few were used in Michigan, Wisconsin and Russia. Lombard began building 6-cylinder gasoline-powered log haulers in 1914, produced a more powerful \\"Big 6\\" later, and built one Fairbanks-Morse Diesel engine hauler in 1934. The internal combustion log haulers (called Lombard tractors) were less powerful than the steam log haulers; and resembled a stake body truck on a skis and tracks chassis. The steam-powered haulers are thought to have been used as late as 1929.Holbrook (1961) p.79 At least ten of the Lombard tractors were preserved at Churchill Depot as recently as the 1960s. Legacy Antarctic Mount Lombard was named in recognition of the Lombard Log Hauler as the first application of knowledge of snow mechanics to trafficability. The Lombard Steam Log Hauler was designated a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1982 following nomination by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
