It is a weapon used by Muslim Filipino ethnolinguistic groups like the Tausug, Sama-Bajau, or Yakan in the Southern Philippines.  Description =Blade Barung blades are thick and very heavy with the weight aiding in the slicing capability of the sword. Barong blade lengths range from 8 to 22 inches (20 to 56 cm) as the average blade length is originally 14 inch. Newer blades, on the other hand, tend to be longer measuring at 18 to 22 inches (46 to 56 cm). Damascene patterns are also thick but again most often not as controlled as the more widely known kalis. Hilt (handle) Most handles have a silver sleeve and lacquered braided fiber rings that sit on top. Nobility hilts were made of ivory, carabao horn, or kamagong (Philippine ebony). Other barong swords have less elaborate hilts and are smaller in size. Common motifs include the cockatoo (kakatua) and the sea serpent (naga). The long metal ferrule is most often made of silver, though copper, brass and swaasa is also used. Barongs used in World War II may also have aluminium ferrules. The ferrule tends to be around 8 cm (3 inches) in length. Often the ferrule will have lacquered braided natural fiber rings to aid in grip. Sometimes these fiber rings were on top of the ferrule, but often what would appear to be a solid metal ferrule would in fact be a number of metal bands that alternate between the fiber bands. Cockatoo pommels tended to be made of banati. Higher end barongs belonging to the upper classes often had large elaborately carved junggayan (elongated) cockatoos. Barong for the lower classes, and the ones used for fighting, have less elaborate cockatoo pommels of much smaller sizes, often featuring de-emphasized crests or beaks (and on fighting versions mere vestigial elements of the crest and beak motifs). At one period near World War II, cockatoo forms changed. Crests became more triangular, and began to emerge directly from the back of the pommel, whereas older cockatoo had crests that flowed from the butt-plain of the pommel. Also, beaks started to become more massive and rectangular in form. Barong used by juramentados, or those who had taken the rite of Magsabil, often would feature smaller blades with normal size hilts. Scabbard A barong previously owned by an Abu Sayaf commander, Mujib Susukan, now on display at the Philippine Military Academy Museum Older barong scabbards tended only to be partially wrapped with large rattan lashings, while newer barong scabbards feature a full wrap of thin rattan. Also, the scabbards of older barong featured thinner flat boards, whereas post World War II barong scabbards are of much thicker stock, and feature a central ridge line. The terminus on modern-made scabbards tends to turn upward to a more dramatic degree, often at a near 90-degree angle and feature squared tips. As with kris scabbards of the post World War II era, mother of pearl inlays begin to appear at the throat and tips of barong scabbards as well.

Shiffrin has contributed a number of theories of attention and memory to the field of psychology. He co-authored the Atkinson‚ÄìShiffrin model of memory in 1968 with Richard Atkinson,Atkinson, R.C. & Shiffrin, R.M. (1968) Human memory: A proposed system and its control processes. In K.W.

In 1977, he published a theory of attention with Walter Schneider.Shiffrin, R. M. & Schneider, W. (1977). Controlled and automatic human information processing: II. Perceptual learning, automatic attending, and a general theory. Psychological Review, 84, 127‚Äì190. With Jeroen G.W. Raaijmakers in 1980, Shiffrin published the Search of Associative Memory (SAM) model,Raaijmakers, J. G. W. & Shiffrin, R. M. (1980). SAM: A theory of probabilistic search of associative memory. In Bower, G. H. (Ed.), The Psychology of Learning and Motivation, Vol. 14, 207‚Äì262. New York: Academic Press. which has served as the standard model of recall for cognitive psychologists well into the 2000s. He extended the SAM model with the Retrieving Effectively From Memory (REM) model in 1997 with Mark Steyvers.Shiffrin, R. M. & Steyvers, M. (1997). A model for recognition memory: REM: Retrieving effectively from memory. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 4(2), 145‚Äì166.  Biography = Career  Shiffrin proposed a mathematical model of memory with Richard C. Atkinson in 1968 while at Stanford University. This laid out components of short and long term memory and processes that control the operations of memory. The Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model showed the importance and possibility of modeling the control processes of cognition, and remains one of the most highly cited in the entire field of psychology.Atkinson, R. C., & Shiffrin, R. M. (1968). Human memory: A proposed system and its control processes. In K. W. Spence and J. T. Spence (Eds.), The Psychology of Learning and Motivation: Advances in Research and Theory (Vol. 2, pp. 89-195). New York: Aaademic Press. Shiffrin graduated with a Ph.D. in Mathematical Psychology from Stanford in 1968, and joined Indiana University as faculty that same year, where he remains today as a distinguished Professor and Luther Dana Waterman Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences in the College of Arts and Sciences. Shiffrin also directs the department's Memory and Perception Laboratory. In the 1980s, Shiffrin's formal theory of memory took a great leap forward with the Search of Associative Memory (SAM) model. This model quantified the nature of retrieval from long-term memory and characterized recall as a memory search with cycles of sampling and recovery.Raaijmakers, J. G. W., & Shiffrin, R. M. (1980). SAM: A theory of probabilistic search of associative memory. In Bower, G. H. (Ed.), The Psychology of Learning and Motivation, Vol. 14, 207-262. New York: Academic Press. In 1984, another quantum step forward occurred, when the theory was extended to recognition memory, in which a decision is based on summed activation of related memory traces.Gillund, G., & Shiffrin, R. M. (1984). A retrieval model for both recognition and recall. Psychological Review, 91, 1-67. It was a major accomplishment that the same retrieval activations that had been used in the recall model could be carried forward and used to predict a wide range of recognition phenomena. Another major step, In 1990, Shiffrin published two articles on the list-length effect which clearly established that experience leads to the differentiation, rather than the mere strengthening, of the representations of items in memory.Ratcliff, R., Clark, S., & Shiffrin, R. M. (1990). The list-strength effect: I. Data and discussion. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 16, 163-178.Shiffrin, R. M., Ratcliff, R., & Clark, S. (1990). The list-strength effect: II. Theoretical mechanisms. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 16, 179-195. In 1997 Shiffrin extended the SAM model with the Retrieving Effectively From Memory (REM) model.Shiffrin, R. M., & Steyvers, M. (1997).

It hosted the first radio beacon mounted in a shore installation in the United States.  History  The New Jersey shore between the Barnegat and Navesink lighthouses, a distance of nearly 40 miles, was unlit in the 1800s, and in 1888 the Lighthouse Board requested funds to establish a light in this area. The original site was to be at Manasquan Inlet, just to the south of Sea Girt; however, the site was found to be unsuitable and the present lot was obtained on the beach at Sea Girt, near Wreck Pond. An L-shaped brick house with an integral tower was constructed, and the light was first exhibited in December 1896. This was the last shore lighthouse with an integral keeper's residence built on the east coast of the United States. Moving sand and erosion were problems from early on, but fencing in 1900 and steel pilings in the 1920s arrested the threat. In 1921 Sea Girt Light was equipped with a radio beacon, the first such installation on a shore-based light. It was installed in conjunction with transmitters on the Ambrose and Fire Island lightships; with a radio direction finder, a ship could fix its position accurately through triangulation from the three sites. At the outset of World War II, the light was deactivated and the lens removed; the house was remodeled to serve as a dormitory for a Coast Guard observation post. After the war, an aerobeacon was mounted atop the tower; but in 1955 the light was decommissioned and a beacon on a steel tower was erected on the lawn. The lighthouse was offered to the state, but when they declined, the borough of Sea Girt purchased the lighthouse instead. It was used for the town library and for meeting space for many years, and in 1981 care of the building was taken over by the Sea Girt Lighthouse Citizens Committee, an independent non-profit dedicated to restoring and maintaining the lighthouse. This restoration was accomplished, and the building is now available both for tours and for a variety of meetings; the beacon was removed from the external tower and placed in the old lantern, now operated as a private aid to navigation. In 2002 the committee purchased the fourth order Fresnel lens originally used in the Crowdy Head Light in New South Wales, Australia for $20,000, a sum equal to that originally appropriated for construction of the light station.

He has performed stunts in over 100 films and television programs and authored one of the first books published in the US about the Balisong knife. Jeff Imada is trained in Jeet Kune Do, Eskrima, Tae Kwon Do, Tang Soo Do, Karate, Shaolin Kung Fu, Kendo and Boxing. Life and career Imada was born in Inglewood, California, US, where he began studying martial arts at the age of fifteen. At El Camino College and UCLA, he majored in pre-med and minored in music as a classically trained pianist. While in college, he started working as a film \\"extra\\", which led to his becoming a member of the Screen Actors Guild, Stunts Unlimited and the Directors Guild of America. Jeff Imada has been the technical advisor on numerous films, including Dutch (1991), Tango & Cash (1989), Jumpin' Jack Flash (1986), Dreamscape (1984) and Streets of Fire (1984), and such television series as Magnum, P.I. (1980), Remington Steele (1982), Dynasty (1981), Matt Houston (1982), Airwolf (1984), Stingray (1986), Hart to Hart (1979) and Tales of the Gold Monkey (1982). He was a close friend to Brandon Lee with whom he studied Jeet Kune Do under the tutelage of Dan Inosanto. He was the primary fight choreographer on Lee's final film, The Crow. Imada has authored two books on the history and use of the Balisong knife and designed a particular grind known as the \\"Imada high grind\\" for Pacific Cutlery that were ground by knifemaker Jody Samson. The Balisong Manual was one of the first books published in the US about this unusual knife. Jeff Imada has recently come to further attention by being the chief fight coordinator in the Matt Damon action films The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum,Matt Damon trains in Kali for ‚ÄòThe Bourne Ultimatum‚Äô, Clyde Erwin Barretto, May 30, 2016 as well as participating as the motion capture artist for the Xbox and PlayStation game The Bourne Conspiracy. In 2015, Imada was recognized by East West Players (EWP) with the Visionary Award for raising \\"the visibility of the Asian Pacific American (APA) community through [his] craft.\\" He had been involved with EWP \\"off and on\\" for many years due to his personal connection to Mako, one of the founders of the theatre company.

He served briefly in the War of the Spanish Succession but left the army in 1703 and spent the next two years travelling in Europe. He returned to London, where he died of fever on 22 February 1705. Life Theophilus, 7th Earl of Huntingdon George Hastings was born in March 1677, son of Theophilus Hastings, 7th Earl of Huntingdon (1650‚Äì1701) and his first wife, Elizabeth Lewis (died 1688). His mother was the co-heiress of Sir John Lewis, a wealthy merchant who owned Ledston Hall, in West Yorkshire. They had nine children, but only George and his sister Elizabeth (1682-1739) survived into adulthood. The two remained close friends until his death; in 1935, a collection of their letters was published by his distant ancestor, George Hastings Wheler. Elizabeth was an intelligent and energetic woman, who became a noted philanthropist and supporter of women's education. Two years after Elizabeth Lewis died in 1688, the Earl married Mary Fowler (1664‚Äì1723), widow of Thomas Needham, 6th Viscount Kilmorey (1659-1687). They had two sons and four daughters; Ann (1691-1755), Catherine (1692-1739), Frances (1693-1750), Theophilus, 9th Earl of Huntingdon (1696-1746), Margaret (1699-1768) and Ferdinando (1699-1726). Hastings succeeded as Earl when his father died in May 1701 but never married and the title passed to his half-brother Theophilus after his death in February 1705. He left an illegitimate son named Henry in Utrecht, who was brought up by Elizabeth and is thought to be the Henry Hastings who was treasurer of the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in 1747. Career His sister Lady Elizabeth Hastings (1682-1739) Hastings was initially sent to Eton College, but was so unhappy there, his father removed him. Thereafter, he was educated at Maidwell's School, a fashionable academy for members of the nobility, near modern day Carnaby Street, London. He subsequently attended Wadham College, Oxford. The 7th Earl was closely associated with James II and lost his offices after the November 1688 Glorious Revolution. Arrested during the Jacobite invasion scare of 1692, he was released without charge but was one of only five peers to vote against the 1701 Act of Settlement. He and George fought a long-running legal dispute over Elizabeth Lewis' estate, which was not resolved until 1703. In December 1688, his father was removed as colonel of the 13th Foot and replaced by his cousin Ferdinand Hastings, who was dismissed for extortion in 1695. Despite this unpromising background, Hastings was appointed captain in the First Foot Guards, shortly before the Nine Years War ended in 1697. By 1699, he was a Lieutenant-Colonel and succeeded his father as Earl of Huntingdon in May 1701. He carried the Sceptre at the coronation of Queen Anne in April 1702; his half brother Theophilus performed the same office when George I was crowned in 1714. A close friend was his distant relative, James Stanhope (1673-1721), who led the Whig government from 1717 until his death in 1721. His father Alexander was a senior diplomat from a junior and less wealthy branch of the Earls of Chesterfield; in 1702, Hastings is thought to have provided James an annuity of ¬£400 per year. Other friends included the Brudenell brothers, George, 3rd Earl of Cardigan and his younger brother James, who both had reputations for wild living. When the army was expanded with the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1701, Hastings was appointed Colonel of Huntingdon's, later 33rd Foot. This was posted to the Low Countries, where he was badly wounded in the June 1702 assault on Kaiserswerth. After the army went into winter quarters, he resigned and transferred his regiment to Henry Leigh. His friend and distant relative James Stanhope (1673-1721) In early 1703, he travelled to Utrecht where he met the German orientalist, Heinrich Sieke, or Henry Sike (1669-1712). Hastings engaged Sike to accompany him to Constantinople, intending to study Arabic; they reached Vienna in May 1703, but decided against going further, as the plague was raging there. Instead, they went to Rome in January 1704. Here Hastings met the Brudenells, who were in Italy from 1703 to 1706, and the Duke of Shrewsbury, a former Secretary of State, who left England in 1700 pleading ill-health. In April 1704, Shrewsbury recommended him to Richard Hill, British envoy in Turin, writing \\"he is a young man, extreme studious and of good parts...he was weary of the service (army), I know not why...(but) his qualities will be of assistance to you in Turin\\". Hill's correspondence indicates Hastings arrived there in May, but decided to return to the army in September 1704. However, he changed his mind, writing to Elizabeth in October of his intention to 'live quietly at home...without a wife.' He and Sike returned to London, where he died suddenly on 22 February 1705; Elizabeth paid for an elaborate memorial at St James' Church, Piccadilly, which can still be found in the east gallery, south side. After the church suffered bomb damage during World War II, the memorial was apparently reassembled incorrectly.

She is perhaps most famous as the ship on which a young Horatio Nelson served as a midshipman. She also participated in four battles off the coast of India between 1781 and 1783. The Royal Navy sold her in 1784 and she then became the mercantile Ravensworth. She made one voyage for the British East India Company (EIC) between 1786 and 1788. She then traded locally until 1793‚Äì94, when she disappeared from the lists. Construction and commissioning Seahorse was ordered on 4 February 1748, with the contract being awarded to John Barnard, of Harwich, on 23 February 1748. Barnard laid her keel that very day and built her to a design by the Surveyor of the Navy Jacob Acworth. She was named Seahorse on 23 August, launched on 13 September 1748 and commissioned in November. She was completed on 17 February 1749 at Sheerness Dockyard, having cost ¬£4,063.10.0d to build, and with a further ¬£1,264.14.8d spent on fitting her out. Royal Navy career Her first commander was Captain Samuel Barrington, who took over in November 1748, and sailed her to the Mediterranean in 1749. Seahorse was back in the English Channel in 1752, with Hugh Palliser replacing Barrington in April 1753. Seahorse then served initially in Home waters, before sailing to North America in January 1755. She returned to Britain in July that year, carrying the flag of Admiral Augustus Keppel. Captain George Darby took command in 1756, and sailed from Britain bound for Newfoundland on 15 May 1756. Captain Thomas Taylor replaced Darby in March 1757. Under Taylor's command Seahorse was active in the North Sea, later fighting an engagement against two enemy frigates off Ostend, together with the sloops HMS Raven and HMS Bonetta. Seahorse was then briefly under the command of acting Commander James Hackman from July 1758, before Captain James Smith took over command in October. Seahorse then left for North America on 14 February 1759, and spent the rest of the year at Quebec. Seahorse was surveyed on 24 January 1760 and declared in need of repairs. A large repair was carried out at Deptford between March and August that year, at a cost of ¬£5,765.19.8d. She fought an action with the French 32-gun frigate L‚ÄôAigrette on 10 January 1761. Captain Charles Cathcart Grant replaced Smith later in the month. She sailed for India on 4 February 1761 to observe the transit of Venus, and then moved to Manila until October 1762 in support of the Battle of Manila (1762). Captain Robert Jocelyn took command in 1763, after which Seahorse returned to England and was paid off in June 1763. Further repairs were carried out in 1770, before she was recommissioned in January 1771 under Thomas Pasley. She sailed to the Leeward Islands in August that year. In 1773 Digby Dent took command, before Seahorse was paid off to undergo another refit. She was recommissioned in August 1773 under George Farmer. Horatio Nelson was assigned to the ship as a midshipman through the influence of his uncle, Maurice Suckling. Also a midshipman aboard the Seahorse at this time was Thomas Troubridge, another future admiral. Farmer sailed to the East Indies in November 1773. On 19 February 1775 Seahorse fought a battle with two of Hyder Ali's ketches off Anjengo. John Panton replaced Farmer in June 1777. Early on the morning of 10 August 1778, Admiral Edward Vernon's squadron, consisting of (Vernon's flagship), , Seahorse, , and the East India Company's ship Valentine, encountered a French squadron under Admiral Fran√ßois l'Ollivier de Tronjoly that consisted of the 64-gun ship of the line , the frigate and three smaller ships, , , and . An inconclusive action followed for about two hours in mid-afternoon. The French broke off the action and the British vessels were too damaged to be able to catch them up again. In the action the British suffered 11 men killed and 53 wounded; Seahorse alone lost three men killed and five wounded.Anon. (1801), Section: Pon. Seahorse captured Sartine on 25 August 1778. Sartine had been patrolling off Pondichery with Pourvoyeuse when they sighted two East Indiamen, which were sailing blithely along, unaware of the outbreak of war. The French vessels gave chase lazily. Sartines captain, Count du Chaillar, first had to be roused from his bed ashore. The British merchant vessels escaped, but Sartine came too close to Vernon's squadron. He sent Coventry and Seahorse after her and she surrendered after a short action. A French account remarks acidly that she surrendered to a frigate of her own size without a fight.Barras (1895), Vol. 1, pp.371‚Äì2. All four Royal Navy vessels in Vernon's squadron shared in the prize money. (Vernon had already sent Valentine off with dispatches.) The Royal Navy took Sartine into service as the fifth-rate frigate . By February 1779 Seahorse seems to have been under the command of Alexander M‚ÄôCoy. Captain Robert Montagu took over command in March 1781, and under him Seahorse was present at the battles of Sadras on 17 February 1782, Providien on 12 April, Negapatam on 6 July, Trincomalee on 3 September, and Cuddalore on 20 June 1783. Charles Hughes took command in 1783, followed by John Drew in 1784. Decommissioning and sale Seahorse was paid off for the final time in March 1784. The Navy sold her on 30 December 1784 for the sum of ¬£1,115, to Richard Buller. Merchantman After Richard Buller purchased Seahorse, he had Randall, Gray and Brent, of Rotherhithe rebuild her as an East Indiaman, and renamed her Ravensworth.Lloyd's Register (1787). EIC voyage (1786‚Äì1788) Her first voyage as a merchantman was under charter to the EIC as an \\"extra\\" ship. Under the command of Captain Collingwood Roddam she sailed to Madras, Bengal, and Bencoolen. Roddam left The Downs on 26 April 1786. Ravensworth reached Johanna on 27 July and Madras on 24 August, before arriving at Calcutta on 12 September. She passed Kedgeree on 30 January 1787, reached Penang on 19 February and Aceh on 4 March, before arriving at Benkulen on 25 March. On her return trip she reached Penang on 8 June, and arrived at Calcutta on 17 July. Homeward bound, she was at Diamond Point on 2 October. She reached the Cape on 29 December and St Helena on 28 January 1788, before arriving at The Downs on 30 March.British Library: Ravensworth.

His photographs are among some of the earliest professional works in Humboldt County, California and later in Hawaii where his work focused on the people of that state.  Biography  Baker was born near Rockford, Illinois in 1880. From 1898 until 1903 he lived in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where he studied at Mechanic Arts High School and took his first photographs before attending the University of Minnesota for one semester. In 1903, he moved to Portland, Oregon and shortly thereafter, in 1904, to Eureka, California. On his arrival in Eureka, his studio was in a tent until moving into a building at 5th and F Streets where he ran a commercial photography studio and became a lifelong friend of the writer Jack London. Baker regularly toured southern Humboldt County on a motorcycle in the early 20th century. He met Edith Frost, a local school teacher, at a Socialist meeting in Eureka in 1906; they married shortly thereafter. Edith Frost Baker's family had holdings around Briceland and Miranda in southern Humboldt; the Bakers would visit them for the rest of their lives. Baker's photos of southern Humboldt are some of the few images of the early 20th century. During his years living in Humboldt County, Baker built \\"the Log House\\" on property that belonged to his mother-in-law who willed it to Baker's only son, Earl Frost Baker. By 1908 he moved his photography business to a new studio at 825 E Street in Eureka and he took his family to Hawaii for the first time. In August, after his return to Eureka, the Eureka Herald mentioned his name several times in connection with a charge of \\"taking obscene photographs\\"; he posted $100 bail and ended up paying a $50 fine. In 1910 Baker moved to Honolulu with his wife and son. His studio and darkroom was located at 911 Kalakaua Avenue from 1915 until he retired in 1960. Baker remained active as a photographer and travel lecturer until 1959. He produced thousands of photographic images as black-and-white prints, postcards and books, and as glass plates. When lecturing, Baker used hand-painted lantern slides to dramatize his presentations; he made larger hand-colored glass plates backlit with daylight when exhibited. The glass plate lantern slides and many of the photographs taken by Baker were hand-colored by his wife Edith. Baker traveled to New Zealand and to the U.S. mainland where he visited Mark Twain and Thomas Edison. Otherwise, he spent his time photographing the land, people and plants of Hawaii. He did commercial work for cane and pineapple plantations, and provided tourists arriving on ocean liners with mementos, mostly photographic postcards and bound books of photographs. His photographs appeared in mainstream media, including The National Geographic Magazine, Baker wrote a memoir in 1964, titled Odyssey of a Cameraman. His studies of the Pacific people of Hawaii are an ethnographic and environmental resource. His Racial Patterns in Hawaii and his Familiar Hawaiian Plants, document a changing environment. Ray Jerome Baker died in Honolulu on Friday, October 27, 1972, a funeral was held over his ashes.  Collections and archives  *Bishop Museum, Honolulu.

World War service=East coast operations Exiting the Great Lakes via the Welland Canal and the St. Lawrence River, Mimosa proceeded by short sailings down the U.S. East Coast. At the end of the year, with the United States at war, she steamed from Jacksonville, Florida, to bolster the defenses of the high priority Panama Canal. For over 2 years she maintained the net defenses at Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, and also installed submarine nets at Trujillo Bay, Honduras; Port Limon, Costa Rica; and Talora Bay, Peru. Mimosa commissioned 10 December 1942. In January 1944, 1-1‚ÅÑ2 years after she escaped a torpedo attack, Mimosa showed the effectiveness of the Navy‚Äôs antisubmarine program to check the U-boat menace when she assisted in removing the nets along the Costa Rican and Honduran coasts.

He surpassed his contemporaries in literary ability. Some paleographers say that he was the most versatile forger of the nineteenth century. The charge of forgery is unsubstantiated. Falconer Madan, Books in manuscript : a short introduction to their study and use. With a Chapter on Records, London 1898, p. 124. Life He was born on the small Greek island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean Sea in 1820 (or in 1824), and died in Egypt of leprosy. Simonides lived in the monasteries on Mount Athos between 1839 and 1841 and again in 1852, during which time he acquired some of the biblical manuscripts that he later sold. He produced a lot of manuscripts ascribed to Hellenistic and early Byzantine periods. He allegedly forged a number of documents and manuscripts and claimed they were the originals of the Gospel of Mark, as well as original manuscripts of poems of Homer. He sold some of these manuscripts to the King of Greece. Greek scholars exposed what some claimed to be forgeries quickly and he left Greece and traveled from country to country with his manuscripts. He visited England between 1853 and 1855 and other European countries, and his literary activity was extraordinary.C. L. Fritzsche, Enth√ºllungen √ºber den Simonides-dindorfschen Uranios (Leipzig 1856), p. 2 ff. Some of his works were published in Moscow, Odessa, in England,He edited in London facsimile of the Gospel of Mark. Facsimile was illustrated by him, and has an inscription, stating that the documents shown within, ‚Äúdate to the time of Christ when he (sic) lived upon Earth among (sic) man or men ...\\" and in Germany. He also wrote many other works which were never published. From 1843 until 1856 he offered manuscripts purporting to be of ancient origin for sale all over Europe. Frederic G. Kenyon writes that Simonides created \\"a considerable sensation by producing quantities of Greek manuscripts professing to be of fabulous antiquity ‚Äì such as a Homer in an almost prehistoric style of writing, a lost Egyptian historian, a copy of St. Matthew's Gospel on papyrus, written fifteen years after the Ascension (!), and other portions of the New Testament dating from the first century. These productions [...] were then exposed as forgeries.\\" In 1854 and 1855 Simonides tried unsuccessfully to sell some manuscripts for the British Museum and the Bodleian Library. Thomas Phillipps was a less critical purchaser and bought for the Phillipps Library at Cheltenham some manuscripts. In 1855 he visited Berlin and Leipzig. He informed Wilhelm Dindorf that he owned a palimpsest of Uranius.Falconer Madan, Books in manuscript : a short introduction to their study and use. With a Chapter on Records, London 1898, p. 125. On 13 September 1862, in an article of The Guardian, he claimed that he was the real author of the Codex Sinaiticus and that he wrote it in 1839. According to him it was \\"the one poor work of his youth\\". According to Simonides, he visited Sinai in 1852 and saw the codex. Henry Bradshaw, a scholar, did not believe his claims.McKitterick, David (1998) A history of Cambridge University Press, Volume 2: Scholarship and Commerce (1698-1872), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, , page 369. Simonides questioned many official scientific positions accepted by scholars. He did not respect any scholars. He interpreted Egyptian hieroglyphics in different ways from Champollion and other Egyptologists. He tried to prove that his method of interpreting Egyptian hieroglyphics was superior.Richard Janko, The Artemidorus Papyrus, Classical Review 59.2 (2009), p. 404. He placed the death of Irenaeus at 292 (c. 130 ‚Äì c. 200). Also, in many other complicated questions he had his own, usually controversial, point of view, but after ascribing the authorship of the Codex Sinaiticus to himself, the rest of his credibility was destroyed by the British press. The Artemidorus Papyrus In 2006 a papyrus book-roll was exhibited at Turin which appeared to be part of Book II of the lost Geographical Descriptions of Artemidorus Ephesius. It was exhibited again in Berlin in 2008. It has been argued by Luciano Canfora that the manuscript is the work of Constantine Simonides.Peter Parsons, Forging Ahead: Has Simonides Struck Again?, TLS 22 February 2008, p 14. Richard Janko also believes that the roll is a forgery.Richard Janko, The Artemidorus Papyrus, Classical Review 59.2 (2009), pp. 403‚Äì410.

Seventh Dagger Fest The first annual Seventh Dagger Fest was held on 24 and 25 May 2008 at The Mad Hatter in Covington, Kentucky.

Seventh Dagger later pulled out of the deal and released the following statement... :\\"Why would we end that is what you would probably ask? The answer is simple, Seventh Dagger is something I have worked on for the last almost 7 years and I saw this deal being the end of the label as it was and is. I saw this as trading the underground status and soul of the label for the potential to sell more CDs and let's face it if I was here to make money I would have left a long time ago. Being a straight edge, hardcore record label is the epitome of being underground or cult and the truth of the matter is that is where we should be. Straight edge is not for the masses and it never will be, so as I see it we might have made a minor buzz for a minute then the world would move on and not give a shit and we would have been tied to some corporate distribution that I am sure could [sic] have cared less about us.\\" Seventh Dagger currently distributes through several well-known distributors, including Hot Topic, Interpunk.com, Very Distribution, RevHQ.com, Smartpunk.com, and their own website SeventhDagger.com.

The show was a survey of recent work in sculpture by artists from the Northeast United States, California and Great Britain that shared general characteristics of scale, simplified geometry and smooth, often colorful, industrial surfaces. Its legacy, which focuses on a subset of the artists in the show, is as the exhibition that introduced Minimal Art to a broad public, both through the exhibition itself, and the wide attention it received in national media. Primary Structures was organized by Kynaston McShine, the Jewish Museum's Curator of Painting and Sculpture. Response This exhibit was a critical and media success as reported in TimeTime magazine, June 3, 1676, \\"Engineer's Esthetic\\", pg. 64 and Newsweek,Newsweek magazine, May 16, 1966, \\"The New Druids\\", pg. 104 presenting the public with a show dedicated to a \\"New Art\\". Critical labels for the art included \\"ABC art,\\" \\"reductive art\\" and \\"Minimalism,\\"See Battcock's, Minimal Art: A Critical Anthology though these labels were all roundly rejected by the artists themselves, notably Donald Judd. The Primary Structures art featured new, stripped-down naked and materials with smooth, shiny surfaces, but perhaps the most unusual new idea to come from the exhibit was the concept of artist as \\"designer\\", not necessarily as \\"maker\\". During a forum on the \\"New Sculpture\\" conducted at the museum, in which McShine, Judd, Barbara Rose, Robert Morris, and Mark di Suvero participated, di Suvero famously remarked, \\"Primary Structures is the key show of the 1960s...\\", and also, \\"...my friend Donald Judd cannot qualify as an artist because he doesn't do the work\\", to which Judd replied, \\"...The point is not whether one makes the work or not... I don't see... why one technique is any more essentially art than another...\\"See Meyer's Minimalism for a partial transcript of this discussion. This show ushered in a radical new way of presenting ideas and space that did not rely on the artist's hand, but rather on the final result. McShine, in an effort to broaden appeal and show a wide variety of artists working in this form, included a West Coast contingent and most of the British artists from the \\"New Generation\\" show at the Whitechapel Art Gallery from 1965. It appeared that Primary Structures was to be formulated around Anthony Caro's former St. Martin's students, and the American group led by a relatively established Tony Smith. 1993 renovation In 1989, a major expansion and renovation project was undertaken at the museum. Upon completion in June 1993, the layout of the Primary Structures show was done away with, and only a few installation shots of the show remain to record the original exhibit and the old galleries.

Born in Bergen, Norway, he was internationally known as a psychoanalyst in the Reichian tradition. He has been described as someone who spent his entire life working with the conveying of ideas through many languages and between different epistemological systems of reference, science and religion (Dannevig, 1975). For large portions of his life he was actively contributing to the public discourse in Norway. He has also been credited for his contributions to strengthening and enriching the Nynorsk language and its use in the public sphere. Raknes was known as a thorough philologist and a controversial therapist. Internationally he was known as one of Wilhelm Reich's closest students and defenders. Family Ola Raknes was the son of the farmer Erik Askildson (Askjellson) Raknes (1856‚Äì1926) and Magdali Olsdotter (born Raknes) (1859‚Äì96) and grew up at the family farm of Raknes in Hamre on the island Oster√∏y in the Osterfjorden fjord near Bergen in a strict pietist environment. There were altogether 10 children of whom 7 grew up to become adults, and five of his siblings emigrated to the United States.Gatland 2010, p. 15f. He was married twice: in his first marriage in 1911 with Aslaug Vaa (1889 ‚Äì 1965, the marriage was dissolved in 1938) they begot the children Magli (1912‚Äì1993), Anne (1914‚Äì2001), Tora (1916‚Äì1995), Erik (1919‚Äì) and Tor (1923‚Äì). The second marriage in 1941 with Gjertrud Bonde (1913‚Äì1975) gave him the daughter Ada (born 1952). Studies and work side by side Ola Raknes attended folkeskole (primary school) on the neighbouring farm and then worked for a while on the family's farm prior to enrolling at middelskole (the next higher level in the education system of that time) in Volda. After that he graduated from the Hambros skole in Bergen in 1904. He took his examen artium as private candidate at Kristiania katedralskole in 1907. During the winter of 1907‚Äì08 he joined the elephant seal-catching vessel Solglimt to the Crozet islands in the southern Indian Ocean to collect plants and animals for the university in Kristiania. A liverwort, Jamesoniella raknesii was named after him. During the summers between 1910 and 1916 he served his military draft duty. Ola Raknes took on miscellaneous teaching positions in the years between 1910 and 1914 and worked as a journalist from 1914 to 1916 in the newspaper Den 17de Mai (\\"the 17th of May\\") while at the same time continuing his studies. In addition he worked during this period as a hotel worker. In 1915 he took his cand. philol. linguistical-historical \\"embedseksamen\\" (a public exam required for most professional positions in the public sphere) with Norwegian language as major subject and English and French as minor subjects. His major thesis was about Egill Skallagr√≠msson. In 1916 he was headmaster at Larvik higher school for one year. In 1917 he got a position as lector in Norwegian language and Norwegian literature at Sorbonne in Paris, and he spent the four years here earnestly by studying general psychology, psychology of religion, biology, sosiology, and furthermore medieval literature, medieval philosophy and theology on the side of his teaching position. He continued these studies when, after Sorbonne, he began as lector in Norwegian at University College in London where he stayed from 1921 to 1922. Ola Raknes' working capacity was widely spoken of, and during a period he worked both as secretary for Det Norske Samlaget, while at the same time working on the dictionary and preparing his doctoral thesis in psychology of religion, M√∏tet med det heilage (\\"Encounter with the Holy\\"), which was published in 1927. The dissertation which was also published as a book (and republished again in the 1970s), investigates the phenomenon of religious ecstasy in view of what was then recent findings and theories in the fields of ethnology, but particularly in psychology and psychoanalysis. In 1924 he went on to finish studies in pedagogy. Apart from this he also worked as a literary translator. Raknes studied psychoanalysis at the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute from 1928 to 1929 and later at the Orgone Institute in New York City in 1946. From 1929 on he had a private practice as psychoanalyst. He published some popularized essays on psychology which he collected in the book Fri vokster which was published in 1949. This was the first book which introduced Wilhelm Reich's theories and therapeutical practice to a Norwegian audience (Dannevig, 1975). Working for the Nynorsk In May 1908 Ola Raknes, then still a student, became manager and handyman for Norskt Maalkontor (literally \\"Norwegian language office\\"), an office dedicated to promoting the still young Nynorsk language. In this job which he had until 1910 he dealt with book sales and administrative chores for Det Norske Samlaget. He provided the momentum behind book publications as well as sales, and he brought the accounting into order, since it hadn't been attended to for the last three years. Being the first secretary of the Samlaget he made a significant contribution to the establishing of its first real administration in a time period when publishing in Nynorsk was starting to become self-sufficient (Skard, 1975). Ola Raknes joined the Studentm√•llaget i Oslo (A pro-Nynorsk organization among students in Oslo) which was founded in 1900, and he attained a central position, among other things he was elected chairman in 1913 but had to renounce the position. In later times he would serve as an often used speaker both in the 20s and 30s. Already as a student Ola Raknes published French-Norwegian Wordlist. Having returned from London he began working on English-Norwegian Dictionary, which was produced between 1922 and 1927. This as well as French-Norwegian Dictionary, which was written between 1939 and 1942, were both written for the \\"school book committee\\" within the Samlaget, where Raknes was a board member between 1915 and 1917. Ola Raknes loved poetry, and together with I. C. Gr√∏ndahl he published the first Norwegian literature history volume in English in 1923. He was an appreciated literary translator, both of scholarly as well as artistic prose. He was the philological supervisor of Henrik Rytter's ten- volume translation of Shakespeare. Sigmund Skard writes of the two dictionaries which Ola Raknes wrote (Skard, 1975), that far from being mere glossaries, they were very personal works which again reflected the quest of Ola Raknes for his identity. Skard compares this work with that of Ivar Aasen more than 50 years earlier. Aasen had made his way through the entire tributary of Norwegian folk speech and compared it with another Nordic language: Danish. Skard writes that Raknes, \\"with strong power of empathy, integrated the values of two of the largest and oldest European cultural languages, procured everything that they possessed, from past to present, and confronted that with his own linguistic heritage and his personal linguistic sense. To check himself he drew in the living present-day speech in one of the richest East Norwegian rural dialects, in collaboration with his first wife, the poet Aslaug Vaa, as well as her father, the farmer Tor Vaa. Long into the future will these books be the daily benefit to everyone who works with the Norwegian language.\\" Both the school book committee and to some extent the popular writings committee of which he was also a member from 1911, acted as schools in publishing where the students had to deal with all aspects of book publishing: market evaluations, editorial reviews, recruitment of authors, practical editorial chores, deals with publishing houses or printers, distribution, marketing and economy. Ola Raknes' dictionaries were reputedly so meticulous that even the most abject taboo words were included, and they became important tools in the cultural struggle of the Nynorsk movement. From 1922 to 1930 he again worked for the Samlaget, this time as secretary to the board, however, in reality he was director of the publishing house. Raknes also translated several works of fiction as well as non-fiction into Nynorsk. He did a groundbreaking job in establishing a philological and psychological terminology for the language.(Dannevig, 1975) Raknes was deeply involved in the Nynorsk movement, which included the H√∏gnorsk movement, and he was a founding member of Norsk M√•ldyrkingslag (\\"Norwegian society for language cultivation\\") in 1928. From childhood through early adulthood=Religious longing Already at a very early age Ola Raknes was intensely occupied with religion. It was particularly the thought and the fear of Hell which these ruminations centered on. Sometime between the age of seven and eleven he began to wonder about what the saved people told, that by repenting they had begot, or been allowed to take part in, a new and better life, a life which the non- repented didn't know of and could not comprehend. He had a vague sense of them being right in some way, but at the same time he felt that they also were wrong. He had an opaque reminiscence of once having experienced this life, in his own words from the time he was about 3 or 4 years old, \\"when he was a church-builder\\". Later he considered this to have been a child's way of expressing that he had known another life before. From about the age of ten and several years onward he attempted to come in contact with this other life. He went to edifying meetings in the village, and he often attended church, although he, just like the saved people, figured that that in particular was less important because it was a lesser likelihood that a conversion would start there. It was a constant fear of ending in Hell which spurred him, because he was certain that was where he would go if he failed in finding his way to the new life. Despite all his toils he never succeeded in attaining religious conversion. He felt that it would be dishonest of him if he stood up and testified the way some of his friends had done, that he had been graced, and he was also very ambivalent about believing whether all those who did so were totally honest. In hindsight Raknes found that partly what held him back was a fear of relinquishing. Discovered determinism During Christmas break, shortly before he turned 17, he stumbled across a booklet about determinism. Flem, Ivar: Mennesket naturbestemt eller determinismen H√∏vik, Bibliothek for de tusen hjem (1891) With the exception of some popularized scientific articles by G. H. Armauer Hansen, this was the first literary encounter he had which made him doubt the religious teachings which he had received until then. Even though he would later forget most of the content of the booklet, it made him consider the belief in eternal Hell without sense, and it also provided him with courage to trust his own thoughts and feelings a lot more than he had previously dared. When a little later he told his best friend, county school director Per Erdal, about his newly gained perspective on Hell, he was joyed to hear that his friend shared his view. The keen interest in religion would now lose its grip on Raknes for a number of years, and the interest in a life after death disappeared, never to return. In the years both before and after he, as a twenty-year-old, got his examen artium, it was common practice among his comrades to make jokes about and with both religion, philosophy and psychology, which was deemed more or less as superstition or play with empty words. Raknes felt that such subjects were unfit for someone who had set out to do something useful with his life, which he had. When he began to study philology after secondary school, he was hoping that the goals and literature which he would study were going to show him a field where he felt that he had a particular calling. However, as absorbing as many subjects seemed at first, none offered to him the labor which would consume him fully. And he felt likewise when it came to the women: He met many whom he liked and also many which, in retrospect, he believed also were fond of him, but during this time it felt like no woman could ever love him ‚Äì even though that was what he longed for more than anything else. Falling in love and first marriage He was twenty-four and a half years old when he experienced his first big love affair since childhood, an event which he experienced as both a revelation and a revolution. Up until this time he had felt as if life only moved ahead in front of him, he being merely a passive spectator. From now on he felt that he lived and that he was himself a part of life, even though he still hadn't found his particular slot work-wise. Ola Raknes and Aslaug Vaa met in the Studentm√•llaget i Oslo. They also were colleagues as journalists for the newspaper Den 17de Mai (\\"May the 17th\\" a now defunct Nynorsk newspaper, at that time one of the nation's most subscribed to. The name is a reference to the date of the Norwegian Constitution Day). It was the interest for intellectual activities which brought them together, believed Aslaug's sister-in-law Thora Vaa (married to Aslaug's brother Dyre Vaa)(Fyllingsnes, page 11). The next years would be focused on more hands-on work: the philology studies, money that had to be earned, as well as an unceasingly growing family. The first daughter, Magli, was born in Oslo the year after Ola and Aslaug married. The family was constantly moving about the first years, and the second daughter, Anne, was born at the Vaa family farm in Kviteseid in Vest-Telemark. In between they had been living in Paris where Ola and also Aslaug were enrolled as students, and they also moved back to Paris in 1919. They lived in Rue Bonnard in a milieu of Norwegian artists, Henrik S√∏rensen and Dagfin Werenskiold being their closest neighbours, but hanging out with the artists was more to the liking of Aslaug. When Aslaug caught typhus and had to return home to Norway after two years in Paris, the two youngest of the then four children went with her while the two oldest, Magli and Anne remained in Paris together with Ola. After the stay in Paris the family lived for about a year in Kviteseid again. Then it moved to an apartment block in Johan Bruns gate at Adamstuen in Oslo which Ola Raknes had bought. There they lived for four years. Following that they moved to Lysaker (just outside Oslo's western city limits) where they remained until 1932‚Äì33. By then Ola had begun making enough money so that they once more could move back to Oslo (Fyllingsnes, p. 6). As the 1930s went on, the marriage began to fall apart. Ola Raknes became more absorbed by psychoanalysis while Aslaug Vaa found her path in writing poetry. Her debut occurred as late as 1934. Their marriage ended on a bitter note in 1938, following years of separate living. Interest in the religious=Religious debate About the time he turned thirty he got involved in a newspaper debate with the school man Jakob Naadland and bishop Peter Hognestad concerning reward for good deeds. The other two believed that man requires a promise of reward to be able to stay on the straight path. Ola Raknes, however, asserted, \\"that it is natural for man to love and be good, those are fundamental characteristics of man and needs no other 'payment' than to have the opportunity to function freely\\" (Raknes, 1959). Subsequent to this debate he started reading different books, mostly at random, about foreign religions, primitive as well as culture religions. Religion studies In the same year, 1917, Raknes commenced his four years as lector of Norwegian language and literature at Sorbonne in Paris, and he had planned his stay such that he would get the opportunity to study of his own heart a portion of the time. The first thing he wanted to study was the relationship between French and Norwegian literature in the Middle Ages. He started to read Joseph B√©dier's great work about Les L√©gendes √âpiques, a work which stunned him and convinced him that if he was ever going to understand the effects of Medieval French literature and its influences, he would also have to know something about Medieval philosophy and theology. Consequently, he contacted the university's professor of these subjects, Fran√ßois Picavet, studied several of his books, attended his lectures, and had several talks with him. Picavet possessed the enviable quality of making compendia when he had worked on a subject, where he summed up the development up through the present time. In this fashion Raknes started to read William James' book The Varieties of Religious Experience, the one book that would make the strongest impression on him above all others, and which later he would translate to Nynorsk. This was the first time that he had experienced that religion was dealt with as a natural phenomenon, and which in any case attempted to free itself from how the religions perceive themselves. He spent many weeks working his way through this book, and he walked about completely absorbed with new thoughts and feelings. Looking back, he writes that most of his friends looked upon him as if he were a loony, although a couple of artists appeared to envy him. On his last birthday, shortly before he died, Raknes described William James as the person who had had the greatest significance in his life (Dannevig). The revelation brought on him by this book was what he had been waiting for and which would show him a field of work to which he could apply himself wholly, one which in any case had importance to him, and maybe also to a lot of others. Raknes now experienced that he could understand the religions from the \\"inside\\", even though he himself didn't believe in any dogmatic religion. This would have to be his task, he felt; to point out what really was true and valuable in religions and at the same time how there had entered into each single religion so much that was not true, but quite the contrary, inimical to life. His yearning to obtain further information grew strong. He needed concrete knowledge, both about the various religions, about philosophies of religion, about ethnology which provides backdrop and fertile ground for the different religions, and about life in all its appearances. He started to read as much as he could in all of these fields, partly at random, and at the university he attended lectures, classes, and seminars in general psychology and psychology of religion. psychopathology and psychiatry, and in biology. Raknes read the basics of the French school of sociology, works by among others Durkheim, Mauss, and L√©vy-Bruhl, and he read numerous books about mysticism. His favourite was Les grands mystiques by Henri Delacroix, who was his teacher. He also read the main works of the then fledgling psychology of religion which had its origin predominantly in America, and of ethnology he read among other things a series of books by Roman Catholic missionaries Raknes continued these studies when, after Sorbonne, he started in a position as Norwegian lector at University College in London where he stayed between 1921 and 1922. The source of true religion What Raknes intended in this manner was for him to be able to explain and demonstrate his strong conviction, which he knew he was yet unable to prove. \\"I wanted to be able to explain and demonstrate my own conviction, which already from the outset I perceived to be true, even though I was aware that I wasn't able to prove it. The conviction was that the source of all true religion is an inner experiencing of life and growth and contact with something outside of one's own narrow self. In its narrowest form, you can have this experience localized in a wound healing, in its widest form, it is a sensation of communion with the entire universe. At first I meant to call this experience 'growth consciousness'.\\" (Raknes, 1959) Back in Norway After three years abroad, Raknes's finances were at a low point, and all time had to be directed toward financially profitable work. He taught languages and literature in high schools and wrote his English-Norwegian dictionary. It was not until 1927, after he had turned 40, that he was able to complete the book he had begun contemplating when he was in Paris, and begun working on in London. The book was M√∏tet med det heilage (\\"Encounter with the Holy\\"), and the next year he received his doctorate based upon it. In the later years of his life Raknes explained: \\"I count myself a religious man, but I am an opponent of all dogmatic religion. The core of all religion is a certain experience both of oneself as a unit and of the unity between oneself and the universe.\\" (Raknes, 1959) From psychology of religion to psychoanalysis From his work with the psychology of religion, Raknes had come to the conclusion that he needed some method for investigating the subconscious if he was to go further in understanding human behaviour. That time, at the end of the 1920s, no such method existed except for psychoanalysis. In 1928, for that reason, Ola Raknes finished up his school work and moved to Berlin and began studying at the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute with a grant from the Nansen fund. From this point he was lost to philology with the exception of finishing his French- Norwegian dictionary, which had contributed to make it possible for him to go to Berlin. While he attended apprentice analysis in Berlin with Karen Horney (who was later known as a \\"neo-Freudian\\"), he got convinced that psychoanalytic therapy was a vocation well suited to his abilities and interests. After having delivered a lecture to the Berlin chapter on \\"Viewpoints on psychoanalytical psychology of religion\\" in 1929, he was selected as member of the International Psychoanalytical Association. In the lecture Ola Raknes clearly stated his opposition to Freud's theories on religion. Raknes experienced progression in his new field of activity, and despite strong opposition from large parts of the medical profession, he was in the process of making a name for himself. Energy- and body-based forms of therapyFrom classical psychoanalysis to the character analysis of Reich= Ola Raknes was always searching for improvements of the therapeutic technique, and he was also dissatisfied with the traditional psychoanalytical explanatory models for man's basic drives, instincts, and aggression, and he was skeptical of the psychological dualism of Freud's theories of these contradictory basic drives, which at first moved between the instinct for self preservation and sexuality, and later between the life instinct (Eros) and the death instinct (Thanatos). It was during his stay in Berlin that Ola Raknes heard Wilhelm Reich's name for the first time, but there would still be some years before he read anything by Reich. He was still busy studying Freud and other \\"orthodox\\" psychoanalysts. It was after Reich had published his book Charakteranalyse in 1933 that Ola Raknes in earnest began moving toward Reich's teachings. Following that book Raknes absorbed himself in Die Funktion des Orgasmus, then in Reich's articles in various psychoanalytical journals, and finally in Reich's own Zeitschrift f√ºr politische Psychologie und Sexual√∂konomie. Ola Raknes found it all to be most interesting and rich in perspective, however, this did not cause him to change either his basic attitudes or his psychotherapeutical technique. =1934 ‚Äì Meeting Wilhelm Reich= Ola Raknes met Wilhelm Reich for the first time at the Scandinavian psychoanalysts meeting in Oslo in the Easter of 1934. Raknes was very much impressed by this strong personality, and the succinctness of his presentations and with which he presented himself during discussions about core elements of the themes that he discussed, helped Raknes attain a clearer understanding of many things. Wilhelm Reich's starting point was the psychoanalytical theories of Freud, but as early as 1925, based on experiences gained through volunteer work at his counselling clinic in Vienna for people with sexual problems, he began developing his theory of sex economy, a work which would continue until 1938. Raknes' first choice would be to commence apprentice therapy with Reich immediately, however, he had no way of travelling to Sweden where Reich was working at that time. In any case, they met again in August that same year on the 13th psychoanalytical congress in Luzern. There Ola Raknes, together with the two other Norwegian participants, professor of psychology Harald Schjelderup and child psychiatrist Nic. Hoel (who would later change her name to Nic. Waal), vehemently protested the blackballing of Reich from the International Psychoanalytical Association (I.P.V.). The Norwegian contingent was later at the congress approved as a distinct group, and this meant they could admit Reich in their membership. Wilhelm Reich did not, however, accept the offer of becoming a member when he moved to Norway later in 1934. At that time Raknes had already started in apprentice therapy with Otto Fenichel, whom he counted as one of Reich's friends and co-workers. He had from the outset told Fenichel that he would have gone to Reich if Reich had been in Norway. =Character analysis and apprentice therapy with Reich= Shortly after Reich had arrived in Norway, he opened a seminar in character analysis. Raknes was admitted to this despite not having undergone any such analysis himself. He tried out the techniques that he learned on a couple of his patients, with fairly good results. In the fall of 1936 he asked if Wilhelm Reich would accept him for apprentice therapy, both because of personal problems and because he thought that Reich's therapeutic approach was far more efficient than the classical Freudian technique which he had applied so far. Reich was in doubt and felt that Ola Raknes was a bit old and too armored, but in the end he accepted. Ola Raknes was probably one of the first patients to whom Reich consistently applied his new technique, which he labeled characteranalytic vegetotherapy. Not surprisingly, due to Raknes' advanced age, the restructuring of his character, that is the apprentice therapy, was cumbersome and lasted for almost three years, three sessions a week. The response did not fail to appear. At times everything felt so destitute and hopeless that he doubted whether he would ever be able to do the work that he still believed he was created to do, in a way he himself would be content with ‚Äì and if he couldn't manage that, there would be no reason to live even. But after a long period of time he finally began noticing that the energies started to make themselves felt; he started noticing what took place inside of his own organism, and what it would mean to be functioning freely. He was struck by the fundamental differences between characteranalytic vegetotherapy and traditional psychoanalysis. Even though he had read Reich's book on character analysis, and he had also applied the technique on his own patients, having the technique work on his own body was something altogether new. Compared to classical psychoanalysis, the technique was now extended to the interpretation of character expressions and bodily attitudes, and to working through somatical blockings through direct manipulation. (Raknes, 1959) =Characteranalytic vegetotherapy= In his practice Raknes emphasized assisting people in working through to the living in themselves and work to release the innate propensity for development, the \\"free growth\\". The way of doing this was by removing the obstacles and blockages standing in the way, and this in turn would be effected when the person learned to acknowledge him- or herself, together with their thoughts, feelings and impulses. The most important part of this was to integrate body perception ‚Äì to feel what one wanted, to yield to the urge if nothing of significance gainsayed it. In the article \\"Life and Religion\\" Raknes, Ola (1956) \\"Liv og religion\\", lecture given at the 4th Nordic Psychology meeting. Copenhagen. [Printed in Nordisk Psykologi's abstract from the meeting and as afterword to the 2nd edition of Encounter with the Holy] Raknes pointed to Wilhelm Reich's definition of life as a continuous process consisting of rhythmical shifts between mechanical tension, bioenergetic charge, bioenergetic discharge, and mechanical relaxation. In it he wrote, \\"Most people are going to need a certain amount of practice in noticing their own bodily states before they can experience this life rhythm. But then they are clearly going to experience it, in particular in two guises: in the rhythmical flow that penetrates the entire body when it is able to freely go along with the breathing, and particularly intense in the state popularly called 'living together', that is in the sexual orgasm\\". =The orgone energy= Even though Raknes conceded that the orgone theory of Wilhelm Reich ‚Äì an expanding of Freud's libido concept to encompass a general life energy, which Reich called orgone ‚Äì wasn't exhaustively proven with reference to the natural sciences' demands for proof, he felt that from his own observations and experiences it must have some merit. In the book Wilhelm Reich and orgonomy (written in English, but translated into many different languages), which he wrote a few years prior to his death, he explains in an educational and easy- to-comprehend manner the theory and its implications for various scientific disciplines, and in relation to society. How Reich was apparently able to make use of this energy in producing rain, using a so-called cloudbuster, a technical apparatus which is said to focus and project orgone energy, Raknes was himself a witness during a visit to Reich's estate \\"Orgonon\\" in Maine in 1953: :There had been a drought that had lasted for weeks, and the weather report predicted continued drought across the Eastern United States. Then Reich pointed the apparatus at a certain point in the sky and left it on for an hour and a half. If this is correctly set up, he said, we are going to experience rain within 8‚Äì9 hours. And quite correctly. After 8 hours we received an 8-hour streaming downpour across some tens of square kilometers surrounding the apparatus! An experience of that sort makes a certain impression. (Gabrielsen, 1962) Six times after the war Raknes traveled to the US to visit Reich, and to keep his skills and knowledge up-to-date with respect to the development of Reich's theories and methods. Then, upon his return to Norway, he would replicate as much as he could of the observations and experiments that he had witnessed in Reich's laboratory, experiments which constituted the foundation for the discovery of the bions and the orgone energy in the body. Raknes was of the opinion that what Reich had discovered was what others before him had described, but then using other names, such as animal magnetism, chi, and prana. Raknes also believed that such phenomena as telepathy and clairvoyance were real, and felt that the only thing that would cause scientists to deny their existence was narrow-mindedness and dogmatism (Gabrielsen, 1962). He believed that continued investigation and research into the orgone energy would possibly shed light on these phenomena. Factors drawing Raknes toward the orgone theory were his lifelong curiosity and interest for the origin of religions, the religious experience and how it shapes man, and he felt it could contribute in shedding light upon these areas on a scientific basis. Furthermore, he felt that it constituted an expansion of therapeutic treatment, from being a limited psychotherapy to deserving to be called a biotherapy. Active as a therapist until the end Ola Raknes had his treatment room in the basement of his home at Nordberg in Oslo, and there he also had his own \\"orgone closet\\" where his patients sat in order to be supplied life energy, a so-called orgone accumulator. He was sought after in many locations around the world, and as late as in his last year of living, albeit tired and marked by illness (Skard, 1975), he traveled to Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, England, and the United States, to visit friends, give lectures and receive patients in orgone therapy. He treated a total of 800 patients, and on his last working day he received five patients. Ola Raknes' work as a psychotherapist is being continued by several psychologists in Norway and also branched to other countries, in particular through Gerda Boyesen and David Boadella, both students of Raknes, who later established institutions for education of therapists in London and Switzerland, respectively. In 1972, at the age of 85, he initiated the founding of the \\"Forum for karakteranalytisk vegetoterapi\\" (this was also the name of a journal which was established in 1992) to assist in recruiting new vegetotherapists (being then at a low point). A notable figure in public discourse His support for Wilhelm Reich when he was barred from the International Psychoanalytical Association in 1934 has already been mentioned. During Reich's residency in Norway between 1934‚Äì39 there were vituperative debates over his theories and practice, and Ola Raknes was one of his strongest apologists. During the so-called Reich strife in the fall of 1937 and throughout 1938 the criticism that was leveled at Reich's theories and methods, in particular from traditional psychiatry, was unusually harsh. The attacks, some of which deteriorated to mudslinging and slander, were often strongly emotional, and Ola Raknes was among those of Reich's proponents who countered the criticism, which was most forcibly promulgated by the psychiatrist Johan Scharffenberg who insinuated that Reich merely pretended to be a physician, that he performed illegal medical treatment, and that Reich had wanted to perform electrical measurements on insane patients having sexual intercourse (Stai, 1954), and later by physician Gabriel Langfeldt (Raknes, 1939). Both in conjunction with the strife surrounding Reich in Norwegian public discourse, and later, during the resistance which Ola Raknes was met with in his work being an exponent for a controversial branch of psychotherapy, what Raknes \\"would represent, was founded on one ground only; his own experience and his scientific conscience. He was not someone merely parroting his great teacher. Nor was he an errand-boy; as a therapist he was in time going to speak out with professional authority. And the only thing that drove him, was what he believed to be the truth. In this respect he showed no deference, and cared not how others might judge him.\\" (Skard, 1975) Journal editor Raknes organized study circles and was also involved in Reich's journal projects Zeitschrift f√ºr Politische Psychologie und Sexual√∂konomie (published 1934‚Äì1938)Zeitschrift f√ºr Politische Psychologie und Sexual√∂konomie (German) and Tidsskrift for seksual√∏konomi (Norw. \\"Journal for sex economy\\", one issue only published in 1939) which he was editing together with Odd Havrevold. Growing recognition After Wilhelm Reich had left Norway for the United States in 1939, few people associated with the community of Norwegian psychoanalysts where longer willing to defend his teachings. Even the American Reich supporters were according to Raknes \\"disappointingly orthodox\\" (Dannevig, 1975). The only people left to carry on Reich's work appeared to be Ola Raknes and Nic. Waal, and following the death of Waal in 1960, Raknes was sometimes condescendingly referred to as \\"Reich's last disciple\\". Nevertheless, several psychiatrists had confidence in him, and his matter-of-fact style and all-over good reputation as a therapist saw to it that the demand from would-be patients never relented, in particular from abroad. And for the last 10‚Äì15 years of his life Ola Raknes was met with unanimous professional acceptance and veneration. (Skard, 1975; Kile, 1989). One among many, actor Sean Connery came to Oslo in 1967 to receive treatments by Ola Raknes (Haga, 2002), something which, for the first and only time, made the popular media give attention to his work, as they created a commotion outside his practice (Kile, 1989). Raknes and his influence on Wilhelm Reich The collaboration and friendship between Ola Raknes and Wilhelm Reich would last through to Reich's death in an American prison cell in 1957. Most people have assumed that the influence between the two for the most part has gone from Wilhem Reich to Raknes, but this may not be the full picture. In the preface to the book Det levande i muskelpanseret (\\"The Living inside the Muscular Armor\\") which was published the same year Raknes died, another Reich therapist, Einar Dannevig, writes, \\"With his modest appearance and infinite loyalty toward his friend, Raknes contributed to a distorted image of himself. He is easily perceived as a loyal and grateful student of the great master even where he expressed opinions of his own which were hard fought for and well tested, Not until after he had turned 80, he wrote in the preface of his book Wilhelm Reich and Orgonomy: 'Some developments of Reich's ideas are due to myself and I am unable to tell, in some cases, which ideas were first mentioned by me, and which ones by Reich'. The fact that this is mentioned this late in a small preface of the best and probably most integrated presentation of Reich's life work having been written, has made many people overlook the fact that Raknes to a higher degree than any other has been co- creating in the development of those ideas which today form the foundation for the advanced development in different disciplines that one sees as the aftergrowth after Wilhelm Reich. With his firm integrity and independence, coupled with realizations which Raknes had arrived at through his studies in psychology of religion, philosophy, and psychoanalysis before meeting Reich, Raknes becomes a true friend and associate to Wilhelm Reich. With his lacking need for prestige, he was able to satisfy Reich's unusually strong demands for outward loyalty, while at the same time acting tactfully as a correcting agent when Reich in his later years could become the victim of his usually creative, but sometimes too lively and lonely imagination. With his more thorough philosophical background and acquaintance with philosophy of science, as well as his manifested ability to systematize, Raknes has meant very much to the development of the psychotherapeutic, biological, and natural philosophical theories that are usually ascribed to Wilhelm Reich alone.\\" (Dannevig, 1975) Left-wing society involvement As he took part in the shaping of society, both the Norwegian and in general, he was focusing on the forces that frustrate and impede free life expression, in the areas love and work both. He was deeply influenced in this by Reich's sex economical sociology and mass psychology. He was a member of Norwegian Democratic Group and he joined the circle of people centering on Orientering in 1953. He was a member of the Socialist People's Party also from that year, and that party's successor, the Socialist Left Party. His opinion was that the making conscious of the individual's bodily-psychological awareness, to which he could contribute through his work, had to progress hand-in-hand with societal changes ‚Äì in the working place, in family life and in neighborhoods. He felt that the way society was organized created dependent individuals. Those family types and norms for child rearing which were prevalent created overwhelming sensations of angst, helplessness and feelings of littleness in the small child when its vital urges and needs ‚Äì sexual or related to contact with other people, or other still ‚Äì were thrashed, rejected or ignored. This in turn, Raknes felt, led, in the adult individual, to a necessity, in order for it to survive, for adaptation through one of two life strategies ‚Äì either a constant, compulsive striving for power and competitive mentality, or equally compulsive attempts to ingratiate with those in power, through self-effacing submission and dutifullness. Ola Raknes thus placed the focus on the connection between current character traits in Norwegian society, such as feelings of either superiority or inferiority, competitiveness and self-effacing dutifullness, and characteristic structural traits in society itself such as concentration of power and bureaucratic control, in which the former provides fertile ground for the latter. (Gr√∏nseth, 2004) A rare aptitude for communication Out of all that he wrote, it was the article from 1953 whose title in English was \\"The Orgonomic Concept of Health and its Social Consequences\\" that Raknes himself valued most highly. It presents a comprehensive psychological and biological perspective of the term health and has garnered praise from many directions and has also been translated into many languages. Many people have nevertheless asserted \\"Liv og religion\\" (\\"Life and Religion\\") to be Raknes' best article, originally a lecture given to the 4th Nordic Psychologist Meeting in 1956 and which deals with the living, the very feeling of being alive. It has been described as \\"a wise man's integrated understanding of what he has encountered in life, but also an encompassing, non-confessional faith.\\" (Dannevig, 1975) Characteristic of his seemingly rock solid grasp of language as a tool for the conveying of thoughts, Raknes, being a lifelong proponent of the radical Nynorsk language, presented his speech in an \\"impeccable, pure in style and somewhat conservative Riksm√•l (a very conservative variant of the Bokm√•l language) in consideration of the Danes.\\" (Dannevig, 1975) With focus on the child and the living=Free child rearing Ola Raknes was a strong proponent of providing freedom to the child so that it could make its own experiences instead of being told by adults how to perceive things: \\"Children always pick their own ideals. As soon as we put up ideals for them, they will start cheating on themselves. They are the ones who should make the choice.\\" (Gabrielsen, 1962) In one of the essays in the book Fri Vokster (\\"Free growth\\") Raknes elaborates on how he as a psychologist sees the child's developmental dynamics being critically dependent on being given the opportunity to learn for itself to regulate such matters as going to the bathroom, what and when to eat and when and how much it wants to sleep, through experiencing and through practicing to master, without the adults spurring the child on. Such moral rules as not to inflict harm on others or to abstain from stealing, Raknes believed children had to find out about on their own, not through admonitions or prohibitions from the parents: \\"I believe that when a child lies, it is because it has been punished for telling the truth. And when it steals, it is because it feels neglected in one way or another. [...children] steal the love that isn't given to them.\\" With respect to war Raknes meant for instance that it would be fine if the parents explained why people make wars against each other and to what this can lead, but they ought to leave it to the child to figure out what to make of it all. (Gabrielsen, 1962) The child in each of us Although Raknes mostly treated adult patients (Dannevig, 1975), it was the child that Ola Raknes focused on so strongly in his educational efforts to promote values and also as a therapist. The child is the center of focus in the article \\"Life and Religion\\", in the book Fri Vokster, in his therapy and in himself the way he was ‚Äì the child in the adult and the child in itself, in center and teeming with life, the child which is devoid of sentimentality and childishness. His friend and student, Rolf Gr√∏nseth said of him that Ola Raknes manifested this child himself in his eagerness and his joy in searching and in pride in himself the way it can be seen in children, but that has been lost in most all adults ‚Äì but that he combined this with an unusual degree of sober attitude. He saw things simply and straightforwardly and gave them names that all could understand. He could easily be misjudged as being na√Øve, but in reality he held a broad view. (Gr√∏nseth, 1975) Similarly was his repulsion great when it came to use of force and repression of others (Dannevig, 1975). Ola Raknes once said to his friend and student Rolf Gr√∏nseth: \\"I too must be allowed to die at some time\\". He died pursuant to a brief bout of pneumonia at the end of January 1975, only a few days after his 88th birthday. Einar Dannevig sums up his experience of Ola Raknes as a man of spirit: \\"The clarity of thought and emotion, conveyed through many languages, the ability to simplify with a taste for the big and significant parts of it all together with a genuine modesty and complete absence of ambitions for power made it a distinctive and a big experience to meet Ola Raknes, preferably in person, but also in writing.\\" (Dannevig, 1975) Offices and associations * Secretary of Det norske Samlaget 1922‚Äì29. \\"Heiderslagsmann\\" (honorary member) 1948 * Honorary member of Studentm√•llaget i Oslo from 1950 * Member of the board of Det norske teatret 1923‚Äì47, * Member of the International Psychoanalytical Society 1929‚Äì38 * Member of Norsk Psykologforening from 1935 * Member of the International Institute for Sex Economy 1939 * American Association for medical orgonomy 1949 * The Wilhelm Reich Foundation 1950‚Äì56 * American College of Orgonomy from 1968 * Forum for karakteranalytisk vegetoterapi (Norwegian) from 1972 Bibliography * Fransk-norsk ordliste (\\"French ‚Äì Norwegian Wordlist\\") (1914) * Chapters in Norwegian Literature (in collaboration with I.

It was cast on 5 February 1484 by order of King Dhammazedi of Hanthawaddy Pegu, and was given as a present to the Shwedagon Pagoda of Dagon (today's Yangon, Myanmar). Description In 1484, prior to the casting of the bell, King Dhammazedi's astrologer advised him to postpone the date, because it was at the astrologically inauspicious time of the Crocodile constellation, and the resulting bell would not produce any sound. After the bell was completed, it reportedly gave an unpleasant sound. According to texts of the time, the bell was cast of 180,000 viss (294 t) of metal which included silver and gold, as well as copper and tin. The bell was said to be twelve cubits high and eight cubits wide. In 1583, Gasparo Balbi, a Venetian gem merchant, visited ancient Dagon and the Shwedagon Pagoda. He wrote in his diary about the King Dhammazedi Bell. His description of the Great Bell said that it had writing engraved from top to bottom around its circumference that he could not decipher at that time: Theft from Shwedagon Pagoda European explorers and merchants began to make contacts in Lower Burma in the early 16th century. Filipe de Brito e Nicote, a Portuguese warlord and mercenary known as Nga Zinka to the Burmese, arrived in Lower Burma sometime in the 1590s. At that time, Syriam (now known as Thanlyin) was the most important seaport in the Burmese Kingdom of Taungoo. In 1599, de Brito led an Arakanese force which sacked Syriam and Pegu (now known as Bago), the capital of Lower Burma. The King of Arakan appointed de Brito as governor of Syriam. By 1600, de Brito had extended his power across the Bago River to Dagon and the surrounding countryside. De Brito declared independence from the Arakanese king in 1603 and established Portuguese rule under Aires de Saldanha, Viceroy of Portuguese India. In 1608 De Brito and his men removed the Dhammazedi bell from the Shwedagon Pagoda and rolled it down Singuttara Hill to a raft on the Pazundaung Creek. From here, the bell was hauled by elephants to the Bago River. The bell and raft were lashed to de Brito's flagship for the journey across the river to Syriam, to be melted down and made into ships' cannons. The load proved to be too heavy however: at the confluence of the Bago and Yangon Rivers, off what is now known as Monkey Point, the raft broke up and the bell went to the bottom, taking de Brito's ship with it. Burmese forces under King Anaukpetlun recaptured Syriam in September 1613. De Brito was executed by impalement on a wooden stake. Current status Many people have tried to save the bell, thus far without success. Professional deep sea diver James Blunt has made 115 dives to find the bell, using sonar images of objects in the area for guidance. Making it even harder to find is the fact that there are also 3 shipwrecks in the area. The water is muddy and visibility is extremely poor under the surface. The Dhammazedi Bell is thought to be buried in of mud. The great Bell rests between the wrecks of two Dutch East Indiaman ships: Komine and Koning David, along with small pieces of De Brito's galleon. In 2000, the Burmese government asked an English marine scientist named Mike Hatcher and his team to raise the bell; they wanted to see it restored to the Pagoda. Hatcher agreed to undertake the project, which has involvement from Japanese, Australian and American companies. Richard Gere is involved in raising funds. The project is not without its opponents: Some pro-democracy campaigners say the salvage operation might be misconstrued as an endorsement by the international community of Myanmar's military dictatorship, and should wait until talks with the regime have progressed or until such time as a democratic government is in place. One of seven salvage projects forecast for Mike Hatcher and his team in 2001, Mike's team was slated to begin the search for the precise location of the Dhammazedi Bell in March that year. After a flurry of excitement stirred up by BBC's announcement of the project, however, it apparently did not get off the ground, perhaps due to complications involved in his discovery in June 2000 of the Tek Sing in Indonesian waters, with the largest collection of porcelain ever found. If the project ever does go forward, divers will use some combination of sub-bottom profilers, personal mounted sonar, night vision devices, and copper sulphate detectors to locate the bell (since the mud around all that bronze would be expected to have a high concentration of copper sulphate). About nine months after the survey they expect to lift the bell from the river. To do this, they will have to build a small version of a North Sea oil platform in the muddy rapids of the confluence of two rivers, and assemble a large crane to lift the bell out of the water. Once it is lifted, they will construct a railway to transport it uphill about half a mile to the Shwedagon Pagoda. This final operation will take about four months. In July 2010, the Myanmar Times reported an Australian documentary filmmaker and explorer Damien Lay to be another foreigner who had decided to take it up as his new project. Lay and his team conducted extensive side scan sonar surveys and diving operations, covering approximately four square kilometers of river floor in the area where it was believed the bell may be located. Lay and his team identified and confirmed the presence of fourteen shipwrecks in the area where the bell is believed to be located. Lay and his team identified two significant targets and acquired sonar imagery of both the bell and the galleon ship. Both targets are visible to sonar and resting on the sea floor. The location of these targets has not been released. Both targets are well outside the area where the bell was previously thought to be. Lay had stated that the location of the bell was not where most people thought, that the myths and legends surrounding the location of the bell was not supported by evidence and that the location of the bell had been significantly overlooked by the misinterpretation of the history. \\"The location of the bell was quite surprising\\", Lay said. Lay had conducted the bell search as part of the Lady Southern Cross Search Expedition, an ongoing operation privately funded operation conducted over the past eight years by Lay. The bell search was conducted as a return gesture to the people and Government of Myanmar for their assistance and support in allowing Lay to search for and recover the wreckage of the Lady Southern Cross and remains of Sir Charles Kingsford Smith and John Thompson \\"Tommy\\" Pethybridge, who disappeared off the coast of Myanmar on November 8, 1935. Previous attempts to locate the bell, by both domestic and foreign teams since 1987, either failed or did not materialize. Some treasures from the Shwedagon, part of the loot, are also believed to be there guarded by nat spirits, and some locals have claimed to have sighted the bell surfacing on a full moon night. At the end of June 2012, the Historical Research Department of the Ministry of Culture and SD Mark International LLP Co of Singapore held a workshop in Yangon for a renewed attempt with the Singaporean firm pledging USD 10 million for the non- profit project. In August 2014, searcher San Linn claimed that the bell has been found and that preparations were being made for salvaging it and bringing it to land shortly. However, these claims were found to be false, and searches for the bell continue.

Evolution Inflight advertising began in onboard magazines as a way to increase ancillary revenue for airlines and pay for inflight content.

Early life Edward George Connors was born in Sharon, Massachusetts but raised in the Old Colony housing development at 265 East Ninth in South Boston, one of the Boston Housing Authority's oldest housing developments. His family suffered from financial problems and moved around frequently, they later moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts where they gave birth to his younger brother James Connors (December 24, 1936 ‚Äì November 9, 2006). Like Edward, James pursued a career as a professional featherweight boxer like his brother Edward and later a career in the U.S. Air Force. Edward was a sparring partner of Anthony Veranis and Joe DeNucci. Edward had a close physical resemblance to heavyweight boxer Rocky Marciano. As a youth he was a regular at the L Street Curley Gym and Bathhouse located at 1663 Columbia Road in South Boston where Stephen Flemmi, James J. Bulger, Frank Salemme and William Bulger all hung out. In high school he was in the Old Colony Regional Vocational Technical High School basketball team in North End, Boston as number \\"4\\" in 1955 and brought the team to the state championships that year. After graduating high school he enlisted in the U.S. Marines. His brother James followed Edward into the military and joined the U.S. Air Force and became a fighter pilot stationed at McGuire Air Force Base. Edward was trained at Fort Devens, Massachusetts where he was later placed in the 1st Battalion 25th Marines. While in the U.S. Marines he started boxing and excelled at it. After his honorable discharge he took up professional boxing. During his professional boxing career he received sponsorship by the boxing equipment and sportswear company Ben Lee, which would also sponsor his younger brother, James. As a professional boxer he worked with professional welterweight boxer and trainer Andy Escobar, Connors was his only client. He later opened up several barrooms in Revere and Dorchester, Massachusetts including \\"The Bulldog Tavern\\" in Savin Hill which began a hangout for known mob associates, loansharking and bookmaking. He is a close friend of Winter Hill Gang associate Alan Fidler. He was involved in bookmaking, loan sharking and drug trafficking with Alan Fidler. Edward was a close friend of future Massachusetts State Senator William R. Keating and Boston Mayor Ray Flynn who were introduced to each other for the first time at his saloon, The Bulldog. He was known as a vicious bar room brawler and worked as a bouncer and a bartender at The Bulldog which he used as his criminal headquarters for illegal gambling, drug dealing, loansharking and planned armed robberies with his associates. Boxing career Connors was a Middleweight boxer who fought with an orthodox stance. He was known for his agility and quickness to fight and earned a reputation as a \\"hard hitter\\". During his professional boxing career he weighed between 158 and 161 pounds. His first professional fight was against Billy Wilcox on August 3, 1954 in Boston, Massachusetts. On April 20, 1959 Connors was knocked out by Tony DeMarco in the sixth round and lost. His last professional boxing match was against Willie Green on December 21, 1960 in Providence, Rhode Island. On April 14, 1959 he boxed against future Massachusetts State Auditor Joe DeNucci and lost. On November 21, 1960 he fought against Willie Green for the New England Middleweight title championship and lost. During his overall professional boxing career he won twenty-two fights and had eighteen fights end in knock outs. He would later use his boxing training to handle drunk and disorderly customers in his Bulldog Tavern where he acted as a bartender and bouncer. Both Edward Connors and Jimmy Connors were managed by Maury Fisher. Spike O'Toole slaying Winter Hill Gang associate James \\"Spike\\" O'Toole was a troubled alcoholic and a habitue of Connor's saloon, the Bulldog Tavern in Savin Hill. He tipped off his friend Howie Winter about O'Toole's drinking habits, and Winter told Connors to inform him the next time O'Toole was drinking at his saloon. O'Toole was later machine gunned by John Martorano as he walked out of his saloon on December 1, 1973. Gangland slaying After \\"Spike\\" O'Toole's gangland murder, Connors openly discussed his role in orchestrating the O'Toole murder with associates and patrons of his saloons in 1975. He also had been arrested in the commission of a botched armed robbery. During law enforcement's investigation into Connors his establishments were wire tapped, where they overheard enough information to bring Connors in for further questioning. Facing prison time and losing everything he had worked so hard for, Connors agreed to turn state evidence and testify against the Winter Hill gang with the promise of being put into a witness protection program and being able to retire with his family in Ireland. Needless to say with so many people on the Winter Hill payroll, word quickly spread up the ranks in law enforcement where Howie Winter soon learned that Connors was talking, and implicating the Winter Hill Gang in the O'Toole murder. Winter sent a message to Connors to give Winter the number for a \\"safe\\" telephone (one that was not tapped by the authorities), at which Winter could call Connors and discuss the matter. Connors was to appear at the station at 9:00 p.m. to receive the call from Howie Winter. Howie obtained the number and James J. Bulger, John Martorano and Stephen Flemmi tracked the number through contacts at Boston Edison to a pay telephone outside a gas station on William T. Morrissey Boulevard in Dorchester. Winter then arranged to call Connors at that telephone at a pre-determined time. One hundred yards away, 150 officers from the Boston Police Department were enjoying a banquet. All later reported to their superiors that they did not hear any of the gunfire. The only problem for the murder, was a Metropolitan District Commission police traffic detail was situated almost directly across the boulevard from the phone booth. James J. Bulger quickly found another phone booth and called in a false accident report to the MDC police. The traffic detail immediately left to answer the alarm, and moments later Connors pulled up in his Cadillac to await the call. On June 12, 1975, John Martorano drove to the gas station with James J. Bulger and Stephen Flemmi in a stolen sedan. The two men walked to the phone booth where Connors was talking to Howie Winter. Bulger and Flemmi, armed with a shotgun and automatic carbine rifle riddled the telephone booth with bullets, hitting Connors numerous times, almost cutting him in two. He died instantly. Personal attack on William Bulger By 1993, it became clear to the junior members of the Massachusetts State Senate that, in his fifteenth year as president, William Bulger had solidified his position. At this time, Bulger was trying to expand his political influence. When Mayor Ray Flynn quit City Hall to become ambassador to the Vatican, a special election was scheduled to replace him. Bulger quickly mobilized his troops behind Representative James T. Brett of Dorchester, the husband of his long-time secretary Patricia Brett. Brett made it to the runoff, but in the final couldn't overcome Thomas Menino, who as the president of the City Council had become acting mayor after Flynn's departure. But that Billy had been able to muscle his lightweight candidate into the final meant he wasn't quite dead yet. Many younger Democratic politicians were growing concerned about the governorship gone and considered the U.S. senators less than attentive to state politics, the face of the Democratic Party had become William Bulger. It was generally construed that any Democrat who ran for governor was portrayed as a puppet for James J. Bulger and the organized crime element in the city. The Democrats would remain in control of the legislature, but the state senate presidency would remain out of reach for any hopeful candidates until William Bulger was forced to resign or was defeated by an opposition member. That task eventually fell to William R. Keating of Sharon, the same neighborhood that Edward was born and raised in. Senator Keating was not an unlikely candidate and competitor of William Bulger to run for the Senate presidency. William Bulger understood that any legislative leader who wished to survive must preserve at least an illusion of upward mobility for his members. If the rank-and-file legislator saw no future for himself in the status quo, Keating would more likely be willing to participate in any uprising against the leadership. Everyone knew that for Billy to survive in the senate, he would have to start easing out his more ambitious members, which including Bill Keating. Billy offered Keating a judgeship, which Keating turned down. Following the job refusal, one day in the spring of 1993, in the Senate chamber in front of the podium, he goaded Billy Bulger. He began talking about his old friend, Mayor Ray Flynn. Keating went on, in loud terms, what a great guy Flynn was. Finally Billy handed the gavel to one of his underlings and stalked off the rostrum, steaming. A few minutes later, a court officer told Keating that Billy wanted to see him. Bulger told Keating, \\"That Flynn is a not a good person, you know.\\" Keating replied, \\"I have known Ray for a long time. I knew him since before I was even a state representative. You know where I first met him? I met him at this bar in Savin Hill. Maybe you heard of it - the Bulldog Tavern. Yeah, I'm in the Bulldog, and so's Ray, and this guy I know, he introduces us. You know who that guy was? It was Eddie Connors.\\" Keating was talking about the same Edward G. Connors that Billy's brothers, James J. Bulger and Stephen Flemmi, had machine-gunned to death in a telephone booth on Morrissey Boulevard in 1975. Billy Bulger knew Connors very well; his saloon The Bulldog was located in his ward and a suspected victim of his brother, James. It was forbidden to mention James J. Bulger or his crimes in Billy's presence, and Keating had done it, in a backhanded way no less, with a smirk on his face. Keating spoke up, \\"Yeah, Mr. President. It was poor Eddie Connors who introduced me to Ray Flynn. You remember, Eddie Connors, Mr. President?\\".

History=Spread of Christianity in Salem  St. Thomas Didymas, one of the disciples of Jesus Christ, came to India and introduced Christianity in Malabar coast in Kerala and Mylapore, Chennai in Tamil Nadu. He came to India at the invitation of king Gundophorus an Indo-Parthian king who ruled over Kabul to spread gospel. He converted the upper class Hindu families in Cranganore. Palayur Chayal, Niranam and Quilon. He consecrated priests from some of these families and built seven Churches in Kerala and then he came to the Tamil country to continue his preaching, incurring the wrath of the local priests. St. Thomas was killed near a Hindu shrine on the mount near Mylapore, Chennai in about 72 AD. The Martydom of St. Thomas at Maylapore led to the rapid spread of Christianity in South India. The next stage in the preaching of Christianity in India began with the coming of Portuguese on the western coast of India in about 1498. AD. They occupied a few trading posts. Soon all the Portuguese trading posts along the Indian coast from Bombay to Tuticorin were made as the Catholic Christian Centres. In 1531, Goa was created the Bishopric. In the beginning, the Christian centres in Tamil Nadu were controlled by Goa Bishoprice. The Popes repeatedly urged the Portuguese Kings to make it their duty to send missionaries to newly discovered areas for evangelization. In response to the call of the Popes, the Portuguese kings sent a number of secular and religious priests to India. In the 17th century, a new department known as Propaganda Fide was established in order to send the Franciscans, the Jesuits, the Dominicans, Theatines and Augustinians missionaries to India for evengelization. Christianity spread in Konkan, Kanara, Malabar coasts and later to Tuticorin, Kanyakumari, Kongu and Bara Mahal and Madurai regions. The beginning of the Counter Reformation and the foundation of the Society of Jesus formed a brilliant chapter in the history of the Roman Catholic Church. The Jesuit priests involved actively in spreading Gospel to many parts of Tamil Nadu. Fr. Francis Xavier was the pioneer among the Jesuits who visited Tamil Nadu. After his arrival at Goa in 1542 AD, he continued his evangelical works in the coastal regions of Tuticorin and Kanayakumari. Works of Madura Mission The foundation of Madura mission had a tremendous effect on the social history of Salem. Robert De. Nobili (1577‚Äì1656), an eminent and dedicated Jesuit was the first missionary who visited Salem to spread Christianity and founded Catholic Church there. He entered the Jesuit order in 1595 and came to India in 1604. He reached Madurai in 1606 when it was ruled by Tirumalai Nayak (1623-1659 AD). Nobily adopted the mode of life of Hindu sanyasis in order to attract higher caste Hindus to Christianity by his adoptive method he converted many Hindu high caste into Christian faith. As a result of his novel way of conversion, Christianity was accepted in the southern parts of Tamil Nadu by low caste and high caste people. After founding a well-known Jesuit mission at Madurai in 1606 AD, he decided to spread the gospel in the neighbouring regions. He established congregations wherever conversion took place in large numbers. In 1623, he toured through many parts of Tamil Country. During the course of the tour he visited Truchirapalli, Senthamangalam and Salem. In June 1623 AD he arrived at Senthamangalam the capital of Ramachandra Nayak, The Vasal of Thirumala Nakak of Madurai. Ramachandra Nayak offered him a site to build a church and a presbytery but after consulting God in prayer, Robert de Nobili declined the offer. At Salem Nobili met Tirumangala Nayak, the elder brother of Ramachandra Nayak and also the dethroned ruler of Senthamangalam. Fr. Nobili followed Tirumangala, a small town in Dharampuri and baptized him there along with his family members on 25 December 1625. On 31 July 1626. Fr.Nobili received the visit of a Pandaram hailed from the sect of Saivism and a man belonged to valluvar caste. The latter one was impressed by De Nobili‚Äôs Tamil book, \\"Sign of True Religion\\" and got himself baptized with the name \\"Mukthi Udayan\\" ( Blissful one). His conversion had a tremendous impact on the evangelical service rendered by Fr. Nobili in Salem region. Very soon Maramangalam became an important Christian centre with 40 neophytes. As this centre was then well established he could leave for other places to continue to preach the gospel. So he invited Fr. Martins and put him in charge of Salem, Maramangalam and Senthamangalam which numbered between 100 and 150 Christians . In 1627 he left for Tiruchirapalli. The little congregations he established grew from strength to strength. Due to the efforts of Fr. De Nobili and Fr. Antonio Vico, a church was built at Maramangalam in 1628 and another one at Salem. Subsequently the Christian Mission centre was established in various places in Salem region Fr. Nobili also established a mission centre at koilur in Dharamapuri. By 1665 AD, there were a large number of Catholics at kongupatti, Ilupuli, Anaikarapalayam, Omalur, Sankagiri, Anthiyur, Mathiyampatti and Ilanagar. Establishment of diocese On 26 May 1930 the Diocese of Salem was erected from the parts of Salem District and from the Diocese of Kumbakonam, Diocese of Mysore and Metropolitan Archdiocese of Pondicherry Cathedrals St. Mary's Co-Cathedral was consecrated in 1975 as 'The Pro Cathedral of Our Lady of Victories' by Bishop Michael Bosco Duraisamy.https://www.panoramio.com/photo/72182867 The parish of Arisipalayam was bifurcated from Shevapet in 1953 and was erected as St. Francis Xavier‚Äôs parish.

History * 13 November 1952: Established as Diocese of Tanjore from the Diocese of S√£o Tom√© of Meliapore When we trace the history of the Church in India, it is as old as Christianity itself. St. Thomas, one of the twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ brought the Good News of God's Salvation to India. We have quite a few evidences to believe that St. Thomas preached the Gospel in the East and West coast of South India especially in Madras (Chennai) and in the city of Kollam(Quilon) (pronounced Koy-lon)in the present State of Kerala. In 1953, the Diocese of Thanjavur was bifurcated from the Diocese of Mylapore which was established in 1606. Mylapore was the second biggest diocese in India. The Padruado Missionaries by their able leadership and dedicated service led this diocese towards the omega point i.e., \\"Christ\\" by bringing many more souls to the Catholic Church. In 1950 Mylapore came under the direct jurisdiction of the Congregation for the Propagation of Faith. Genesis of the Diocese: The Diocese of Thanjavur was bifurcated from the Diocese of Mylapore on 23 November 1952 by the Holy See, and was erected into a diocese by the Papal Bull Ex Primaevae Ecclesiae Missionaries in the Diocese: The territory that constitutes the present Diocese of Thanjavur has been the field of the heroic labour of the Portuguese Padruado Missionaries from Goa, Franciscans, Augustinians, Jesuits, Foreign Missionary Society of Paris (MEP), Salesians and the Diocesan Clergy. Geography of the Diocese: At Present the Diocese of Thanjavur comprises the entire districts of Thanjavur, Thiruvarur and Nagai (excepting two taluks of Papanasam and Kumbakonam in the district of Thanjavur). It is also covers six taluks of Pudukottai district and two taluks of Cuddalore district. Shepherds of the Diocese: On 25 March 1953 R.A. Sundaram became the first Bishop of Thanjavur. With his motto \\"Cor Jesu et Mariae spes mea\\" and with his special gifts for masterly planning and efficient administration, Sundaram began to build the diocese from scratch. Under his leadership the diocese grew steadily and strongly in every aspect of life. After 33 years of laudable Episcopal ministry, Sundaram retired in 1986. His successor P. Arokiaswamy (called Archbishop) took charge on 26 November 1986 and continued to lead the diocese to realize her goal. After 11 years of fruitful Episcopal ministry he retired in July 1997. M. Devadass Ambrose was consecrated as bishop of Thanjavur on 24 September 1997. He is the third bishop of the Diocese of Thanjavur. Known for his hard work and sincerity he continues to lead the Diocese in the right direction. Bishops & Priests from the Diocese: When Sundaram started his ministry there were only 48 priests, many of whom were aged. On seeing the urgent need for priests, the Bishop established a minor seminary in 1953 at Thanjavur. Today this institution is proud of having trained 165 priests in its 46 years of service. The Diocese of Thanjavur is also proud of five of her priests having been elevated to the order of Episcopate. They are Arulaiah, former Bishop of Cuddappa, S.T. Amalanather, former Bishop of Tuticorin and S.L. Gabriel, former Bishop of Trichy, Bishop F. Antonysamy, the Bishop of Kumbakonam and M. Devadass Ambrose, Bishop of Thanjavur. At present, the Diocese has 184 priests among whom nine are retired and the others are working in the vineyard of the Lord with full vigour and zeal. Religious men & women in the Diocese: Along with the Diocesan clergy, men religious, both Priests & Brothers, also work in different parishes giving witness to their specific charisms. They include the Salesians, Carmelites (OCD), Missionaries of St. Francis De Sales (MSFS) and Sacred Heart Brothers. Along with these men, 481 Religious Sisters belonging to 22 different Congregations also help in the mission of the diocese. Education: In view of educating the poor children, the Diocese has established 44 orphanages mostly attached to the parishes, which give an integral formation crossing the barriers of caste, religion and language. In all over India the Diocese of Thanjavur runs the highest number of orphanages. There are 103 High Schools and Higher Secondary Schools, middle schools and primary schools and three Industrial Training Centres through which educational services are provided, both academic and technical. St.Antony's Higher Secondary School is an important school which is currently governing by this diocese administration. Social Service: A remarkable work is done in the field of Social Service. Training programmes, awareness programmes on health & hygiene and Self-development programmes such as credit unions are organized for the social welfare of the population in the diocese. There are two social service centres in the Diocese: Thanjavur Multipurpose Social Service Society ‚Äì TMSSS having its central office at Thanjavur and Pudukkottai Multipurpose Social Service Society ‚Äì PMSSS having its central office at Pudukkottai. Pastoral Ministry: There were only 41 Parishes when the Diocese was started. As the number of souls grew, so arose the need for creating new parishes. At present there are 74 parishes and 948 substations. The catholic population of the diocese numbers around two hundred thousand (two lakhs; 2,00,000). The pastoral activities in the diocese is vibrant with many independent commissions for Bible, liturgy, catechism, youth animation, social communication, ecumenism & dialogue with non-Christians, etc. It is worth to note that at present the diocese is experiencing a remarkable spiritual renewal and greater participation of the laity in her life and ministry. Many activities are being organized at various levels for a meaningful celebration of the Great Jubilee 2000. A team of priests, sisters, trained mission catechists and lay people visit every parish for Parish Spiritual Renewal Day. Through retreats, seminars and cultural programmes spiritual renewal is brought forth among the Catholic population of the Diocese. Publications in the Diocese: The Diocese publishes two monthly magazines one in English (Vailankanni Calling) and another in the local language (Vailankanni Kuraloli in Tamil language) to propagate the devotion to Our Lady of Health, Vailankanni. Besides these two magazines there are also other publications in the Diocese as follows: Diocesan News Letter and official letter published every month, Deiva Saptham ‚Äì monthly publication from the Diocesan Charismatic Centre, Urimai Vazhvu ‚Äì published from TMSSS and small pamphlets and booklets published from Oli Nilayam an Catholic Enquiry Centre at Thanjavur. Shrine Basilica of Vailankanni: (Marian Shrine in India known as Lourdes of the East) In the Diocese of Thanjavur there is a famous Marian Shrine at a place known as Vailankanni where pilgrims throng in thousands all through the year. In the sixteenth century, Our Lady appeared to a lame boy in Vailankanni and saved the Portuguese sailors when they were caught in the storm. Many miracles are taking place in this shrine of Our Lady of Health, Vailankanni.

It serves the MBTA Ashmont‚ÄìMattapan High-Speed Line. It is located at Butler Street in the Lower Mills section of the Dorchester neighborhood. It serves a small residential area sandwiched between the Neponset River, Cedar Grove Cemetery, and Dorchester Park. Butler station has no MBTA bus connections. It is accessible via a wooden mini-high ramp on the station's single island platform. History=Old Colony branches In December 1847, the Dorchester and Milton Branch Railroad opened from Neponset to Mattapan and was immediately leased by the Old Colony Railroad as its Milton branch. The Old Colony built its Shawmut Branch Railroad from Harrison Square to Milton in December 1872, joining the Milton branch east of Butler. The area that is now the small Butler Street neighborhood was still empty land in the 1870s, but was developed by the late 1880s. The Old Colony Railroad became part of the New Haven Railroad system in 1893. The lines never had a station at Butler Street due to its proximity to Milton proper, though a freight house for Milton was built at the Butler Street crossing in the 1910s. Trolley conversion and Butler station The newly opened Butler Street station in 1931 The accessible mini-high ramp at Butler, added during the 2006-2007 renovation Passenger service on the Shawmut Branch ended on September 6, 1926 to allow the Boston Elevated Railway to construct its rapid transit Dorchester Extension to Ashmont. Construction on a high-speed trolley line from Ashmont to Mattapan began in early 1929, and the line opened as far as Milton on August 26, 1929. The high-speed trolley line entered the center of the Milton branch right of way on a flyover, and ran to Milton flanked by the Milton branch tracks. Commuter rail service ended when the trolley line reached Milton, over the protests of Milton residents who wanted limited service kept while the trolley line was extended to Mattapan. After four more months of construction, the full trolley line was opened to Mattapan on December 21, 1929. In 1930, the Boston Transit Department authorized the construction of an infill station at Butler Street, at an estimated cost of $13,695, to serve the small adjacent neighborhood. Butler Street station opened on October 7, 1931. Uniquely on the line, the station was built with a single center island platform rather than two side platforms; this was necessary because freight service continued on the Milton branch, which bracketed the trolley tracks. A footbridge spanned both freight and trolley tracks, with a set of stairs leading to the station platform, which was covered by a canopy. The freight house remained in use by the New Haven Railroad. In the early 1980s, the station was rebuilt. The pedestrian bridge was removed and a grade crossing built for platform access; the outer parts also served as small side platforms. An awkward gable roof was added to the old canopy supports. The MBTA closed the line on June 24, 2006 to allow a new viaduct to be constructed at Ashmont station. During the closure, all stations on the line were modernized and (except for Valley Road) made accessible. Butler station received a new platform and canopy, with a wooden ramp for accessibility. Trolley service resumed on December 22, 2007.

He appeared in 78 films between 1942 and 1991. Life and career Born Galeazzo Bentivoglio in Florence, Italy, a descendant of the Bentivoglio family, which ruled Bologna from 1401 until 1506 and from 1511 until 1512, he started his career as a cartoonist and a set designer. After his first roles in 1942, he had his breakout in 1943, in Sergio Tofano's Gian Burrasca, in which he played a frivolous and falsely modest snob, a role he specialized during his career. After successfully alternating between cinema and revue, in the late 1950s he moved to Venezuela, where he worked in a television channel dedicated to Italian immigrants. He came back to Italy in the early 1980s, and here he reprised his acting career equally splitting between films and TV-series until his death from a heart attack in 1993.

On February 23, Mexican troops under General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna entered San Antonio de Bexar, Texas and surrounded the Alamo Mission. The Alamo was defended by a small force of Texians and Tejanos, led by William Barrett Travis and James Bowie, and included Davy Crockett. Before beginning his assault on the Alamo, Santa Anna offered them one last chance to surrender. Travis replied by opening fire on the Mexican forces and, in doing so, effectively sealed their fate.Fowler (2007), p.166. The siege ended when the Mexican Army launched an early-morning assault on March 6. Almost all of the defenders were killed, although several civilians survived. Background In 1835, as the Mexican government began to shift away from a federalist model, violence erupted in several Mexican states, including the border region Mexican Texas.Todish et al. (1998), p. 6. By the end of the year, Texian forces had expelled all Mexican soldiers from the area.Barr (1990), p. 56. In Mexico City, President Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna had begun gathering an army to retake Texas.Lord (1961), p. 73. When Mexican troops departed San Antonio de B√©xar (now San Antonio, Texas, US), Texian soldiers established a garrison at the Alamo Mission, a former Spanish religious outpost which had been converted to a makeshift fort. Described by Santa Anna as an \\"irregular fortification hardly worthy of the name\\",Edmondson (2000), p. 129. the Alamo had been designed to withstand an attack by native tribes, not an artillery-equipped army.Edmondson (2000), p. 128. The complex sprawled across , providing almost of perimeter to defend.Edmondson (2000), p. 131. An interior plaza was bordered on the east by the chapel and to the south by a one-story building known as the Low Barracks. A wooden palisade stretched between these two buildings.Todish et al. (1998), p. 10. The two-story Long Barracks extended north from the chapel.Myers (1948), p. 181. At the northern corner of the east wall stood a cattle pen and horse corral.Edmondson (2000), p. 364. The walls surrounding the complex were at least thick and ranged from high.Myers (1948), p. 180.The plaza covered an area long and wide. The Low Barracks was long, and the Long Barracks was long and wide. (Myers (1948), pp. 180-81.) On February 11, the commander of the Alamo, Colonel James C. Neill, left the Alamo, likely to recruit additional reinforcements and gather supplies. In his absence, the garrison was jointly commanded by newcomers William B. Travis--a regular army officer-- and James Bowie, who had commanded a volunteer company.Todish et al. (1998), p. 32. As the Texians struggled to find men and supplies, Santa Anna's army began marching north. On February 12 they crossed the Rio Grande.Although the Rio Grande now marks the border between Texas and Mexico, in this era the Nueces River, several hundred miles north, was considered the southern boundary of Mexican Texas. On February 16 and February 18 local resident Ambrosio Rodriguez warned his good friend William Barret Travis that their relatives further south claimed that Santa Anna was on the march towards Bexar.Lord (1961), p. 86.Lord (1961), p. 87. Two days later Juan Seguin's scout Blas Mar√≠a Herrera reported that the vanguard of the Mexican army had crossed the Rio Grande. There had been many rumors of Santa Anna's imminent arrival, but Travis ignored them.Petite (1999), p. 25. For several hours that night a council of war held at the Alamo argued over whether to believe the rumors. Travis was convinced that the Mexican army would not arrive in Bexar until at least mid-March. He, and others in the Texian army thought Santa Anna would not march until spring, when the grass had begun to grow again. They overlooked the fact that mesquite grass sprouted earlier than normal grass.Chariton (1990), p. 159. Travis had also assumed that Santa Anna would not have begun gathering troops for an invasion of Texas until after he had learned of Cos's defeat; the Texians did not realize that Santa Anna had begun preparations for an invasion months before.Meyers (1948), p. 131. Despite the Texian disbelief, by the evening of February 20 many of the residents of Bexar began to pack their belongings in preparation for leaving. The next day, fifteen of the Tejano volunteers at the Alamo resigned.Hardin (1994), p. 121. Seguin had asked Travis to release the men so that they could help evacuate their families, who were in the path Santa Anna would take to reach Bexar.Petite (1999), p. 26. Santa Anna had crossed the Rio Grande on February 16. The next night, his army camped on the Nueces River, from Bexar.Lord (1961), p. 88. Texians had previously burned the bridge over the Nueces, forcing the Mexicans to build a makeshift structure of branches and dirt in the pouring rain. The delay was brief, and on February 19 the vanguard of the army camped along the Frio River, from Bexar. The following day they reached Hondo, less than away. By 1:45 pm on February 21 Santa Anna and his vanguard had reached the banks of the Medina River, from Bexar. Waiting there were dragoons under Colonel Ramirez y Sesma, who had arrived the previous evening.Lord (1961), p. 89. With no idea that the Mexican army was so close, all but 10 members of the Alamo garrison joined about 2000 Bexar residents at a fiesta to celebrate George Washington's birthday.Nofi (1992), p. 76. Centralists in Bexar soon alerted Santa Anna to the party, and he ordered General Ramirez y Sesma to lead a cavalry force to take the Alamo while the garrison celebrated elsewhere. The raid had to be called off when sudden rains made the Medina unfordable.Todish et al. (1998), p. 36. The next night, Santa Anna and his army camped at Leon Creek, west of what is now Downtown San Antonio.Edmondson (2000), p. 299. February 23 In the early hours of February 23, residents began fleeing B√©xar, fearing the Mexican army's imminent arrival. Although unconvinced by the reports, Travis stationed a soldier in the San Fernando church bell tower--the highest location in town --to watch for signs of an approaching force. Travis then sent Captain Philip Dimitt and Lieutenant Benjamin Noble to scout for the Mexican Army's location.Lindley (2003), p. 87. At approximately 2:30 that afternoon the church bell began to ring; the soldier stationed in the tower claimed to have seen flashes in the distance. Dimitt and Noble had not returned, so Travis sent Dr. James SutherlandAlthough many Alamo historians describe Dr. James Sutherland's participation in the early events of the siege, in his book Alamo Traces: New Evidence and New Conclusions Thomas Ricks Lindley concludes that Sutherland was not present in San Antonio de Bexar on February 23. and John W. Smith on horseback to scout the area. Smith and Sutherland spotted members of the Mexican cavalry within of the town and returned to B√©xar at a run. According to later reports from Santa Anna, the cavalry, under General Joaqu√≠n Ram√≠rez y Sesma, were supposed to execute a surprise attack on the morning of February 23. Historian Thomas Ricks Lindley concluded that Sesma's troops had captured a Texian spy, Trinidad Coy, who lied about a Texian ambush further ahead, prompting Sesma to halt at 7 a.m. and wait for reinforcements.Lindley (2003), p. 86. Historian Lon Tinkle speculated that the combination of the church bell ringing and the sight of the two Texian scouts led Sesma to believe that the Texians were planning an assault on the cavalry.Tinkle (1985), p. 239. At this point there were approximately 156 effective Texian soldiers in the Alamo, with another 14 in the hospital. Juan Seguin also entered the compound on the 23 bringing 14 of his men and their family members into the Alamo. Although they had fought at the Battle of Bexar and Captain Salvador Flores was serving in the Alamo under Colonel Neill, Travis considered them as civilians at this point and would not have included them in his total. see Lindley pg.94 The men were completely unprepared for the arrival of the Mexican army, and had no food in the mission. The men quickly herded cattle in the Alamo and scrounged for food in nearby houses.Edmondson (2000), p. 301. They were able to gather enough beef and corn into the Alamo to last a month. The Alamo garrison also had a large supply of captured Mexican muskets, with over 19,000 paper cartridges, but only a limited supply of powder for the artillery.Edmondson (2000), p. 303. Several members of the garrison dismantled the blacksmith shop of Antonio Saez and moved much of the material into the Alamo. A few members of the garrison brought their families into the Alamo to keep them safe. Among these was Alamaron Dickinson, who fetched his wife Susanna and their daughter Angelina, and Bowie, who brought his deceased wife's cousins, Gertrudis Navarro and Juana Navarro Alsbury and Alsbury's young son into the fort.Lord (1961), p. 95. It is likely that Navarro and Alsbury also brought their family's servants, Sam and Bettie.Lindley (2003), p. 94.Alsbury's husband, Horace Alsbury, was a member of the Texian army and departed for Gonzales immediately after Juana moved into the Alamo to warn the settlers that the Mexican Army was outside of B√©xar. Lindley (2003), p. 87. A flag similar to this was raised in Military Plaza in defiance of the Mexican troops. The two stars represented Mexican Texas and Coahuila as separate states. While the bulk of the garrison prepared for the attack, a few Texians remained in B√©xar and raised a flag in the middle of Military Plaza. According to historian J.R. Edmondson, \\"The flag was a variation of the Mexican tricolor with two stars, representing the separated states of Texas and Coahuila, gleaming from the white center bar.\\" Within an hour the first of the Mexican cavalry, commanded by Colonel Jose Vicente Minon, entered B√©xar.Scott (2000), p. 82.Lindley (2003), p. 89. The Texians lowered their flag and brought it into the Alamo. As the Mexican cavalry approached, Travis dispatched a man named John Johnson to ask Colonel James Fannin, southeast, to send reinforcements immediately.Lindley (2003), p. 88. Travis then sent Smith and Sutherland to bring a message to the alcade at Gonzales, away.Nofi (1992), p. 78. The note to Gonzales read: \\"The enemy in large force is in sight. We want men and provisions. Send them to us. We have 150 men and are determined to defend the Alamo to the last.\\" By late afternoon, B√©xar was occupied by about 1500 Mexican troops, who quickly raised a blood-red flag signifying \\"No Quarter\\".Todish et al. (1998), p. 40. Soon after, a Mexican bugler sounded the request for parley. Travis ordered the Alamo's 18-pounder cannon fired. The Mexican army responded with four balls from 7-in howitzers; the balls hit the interior of the Alamo but caused no damage or injuries. Santa Anna later reported that the initial Texian cannon fire killed two Mexican soldiers and wounded eight others; no other Mexican officer, however, reported fatalities from that day.Edmondson (2000), p. 304. Bowie believed that Travis had acted hastily and sent Green B. Jameson to meet with Santa Anna. Jameson carried a letter addressed to \\"The Commander of the invading forces below Bejar\\" and signed \\"Commander of the volunteers of Bejar\\".Edmondson (2000), p. 307. Angry that Bowie presented himself as Santa Anna's equal,Lord (1961), p. 101. the Mexican general refused to meet with Jameson, but allowed Colonel Juan Almonte and Jose Bartres to parley. Almonte later said that Jameson asked for an honorable surrender, but Bartres replied \\"I reply to you, according to the order of His Excellency, that the Mexican army cannot come to terms under any conditions with rebellious foreigners to whom there is no recourse left, if they wish to save their lives, than to place themselves immediately at the disposal of the Supreme Government from whom alone they may expect clemency after some considerations.\\"Todish et al. (1998), pp. 40-41. Travis was angered that Bowie had acted unilaterally and sent his own emissary to the Mexican army; he received the same response. Bowie and Travis then mutually agreed to fire the cannon again.Edmondson (2000), p. 308. By the time the parleys were over it was nightfall, and the firing ceased. That evening the Mexicans erected an artillery battery near the Veramendi house.Todish et al. (1998), p. 41. Santa Anna also sent General Ventura Mora's cavalry to circle to the north and east of the Alamo to prevent the arrival of Texian reinforcements.Edmondson (2000), p. 310. According to Edmondson, the Texians sent a small party to forage that evening. They returned with six pack mules and a prisoner, a Mexican soldier who would later be used to interpret Mexican bugle calls.Edmondson (2000), p. 309. The Texians received one reinforcement that night, when one of Seguin's men, Gregorio Esparza, arrived with his family. Texian sentries refused to open the gate, but others helped the family climb through the window of the chapel.Lord (1961), p. 105. Several other Texian soldiers were unable to make it into the Alamo. Dimitt and Noble, who had been scouting for signs of the Mexican army, were told by a local that Bexar was surrounded, and they would be unable to re-enter the town. Andrew Jackson Sowell and Byrd Lockhart had been out that morning looking for provisions; on hearing that the Alamo was surrounded they left for their homes in Gonzales. February 24 Wednesday February 24 marked the first full day of siege. Throughout the day, the Mexican army reconnoitered the Alamo defenses. At 11 a.m. Santa Anna accompanied the cavalry on a scouting mission, coming within musket shot of the Alamo. Later that afternoon Santa Anna personally presided over the distribution of shoes to some members of his army. At roughly the same time, he ordered a Mexican artillery battery consisting of two 8-lb cannon and a mortar located from the Alamo to begin firing. Mexican Colonel Juan Almonte wrote in his diary that two of the Alamo's guns, including the massive 18-lb cannon, were dismounted. The Texians were able to bring them back into service quickly.Todish et al. (1998), p. 42. Bowie had been ill,Hopewell (1994), p. 115. and at some point during the day he collapsed and was confined to his bed.Nofi (1992), p. 80. Fearing that he was contagious, Bowie moved into a small room in the low barracks along the south wall of the mission.Edmondson (2000), p. 311. Travis was now in sole command of the garrison. That afternoon Travis wrote a letter addressed To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World, which is, according to Mary Deborah Petite \\"considered by many as one of the masterpieces of American patriotism\\".Petite (1998), p. 88. Travis sent the letter with courier Albert Martin, who delivered it to Gonzales. There, Launcelot Smithers took custody of the message and delivered it to San Felipe,Petite (1998), p. 89. where it was read by Governor Henry Smith. Smith told the colonists at San Felipe \\"to fly to the aid of your besieged countrymen and not permit them to be massacred by a mercenary foe. ... The call is upon ALL who are able to bear arms, to rally without one moment's delay, or in fifteen days the heart of Texas will be the seat of war.\\"Petite (1998), p. 90. The letter was eventually reprinted throughout the United States and much of Europe. In early evening, Mexican Colonel Juan Bringas led scouts across a footbridge over the San Antonio River; Texian sharpshooters quickly killed one soldier and the Mexicans retreated, but Davy Crockett managed to drop a second man before the enemy finally reached cover. Throughout the night the Mexican artillery sporadically bombarded the church and long barracks, while the Mexican army fired muskets and shouted to fool the Texians into believing that an assault was imminent, or that Texian reinforcements were being slaughtered.Edmondson (2000), p. 34. Santa Anna also ordered that his military band serenade the Texians throughout the night. Mexican soldiers took advantage of the darkness and the distractions of the countrymen to erect two more artillery batteries around the Alamo. The two batteries combined to hold two 8-lb cannon, two 6-lb cannon, two 4-lb cannon, and two 7-in howitzers. One of the batteries was located along the right bank of the San Antonio River, approximately from the south wall of the Alamo. The other was located east of the eastern wall. By the end of the first full day of siege the Mexican army had been reinforced by 600 of Sesma's troops.Lord (1961), p. 107. Antonio Gaona and the First Brigade were still several days march away, while an additional 400-500 men and most of the Mexican artillery were struggling through mud south of Bexar.Nofi (1992), p. 81. February 25 The Mexican bombardment continued through the morning of February 25. At approximately 10 a.m. about 200-300 Mexican soldiers, primarily cazadores from the Matamoros Battalion, crossed the San Antonio river and took cover in abandoned shacks approximately to from the Alamo walls.Todish et al. (1998), p. 43.Tinkle (1985), p. 118. The Mexican soldiers were intending to use the huts as cover to erect another artillery battery, although many Texians assumed they were actually launching an assault on the fort.Tinkle (1985), p. 119. Travis called for volunteers to burn the huts, despite the fact that it was broad daylight and they would be within musket range of the Mexican soldiers. Charles Despallier, Robert Brown, James Rose and a few others volunteered for the mission.Lord (1961), p. 109. To provide cover, Dickinson and his men fired their 8-lb cannons, filled with grapeshot and canister, at the Mexican soldiers in the huts. Crockett and his men fired rifles, while other Texians reloaded extra weapons for them. Within two hours the battle was over. As soon as the Texians saw flames erupting from the huts they threw open the Alamo gate, and the Texians re-entered the Alamo, unscathed,Tinkle (1985), p. 120. although Rose was almost captured by a Mexican officer. The Mexican soldiers retreated,Nofi (1992), p. 83. after six of their soldiers were killed and four wounded, while several Texians had been mildly scratched by flying rock. That afternoon Mexican soldiers were posted east of the Alamo, on the road to Gonzales. Santa Anna learned that a beautiful 17-year-old girl, Melchora Barrera, and her widowed mother had remained in town, and he dispatched one of his men to ask the girl to be Santa Anna's mistress. According to historian J.R. Edmondson, the girl's mother refused the offer, and, although Santa Anna was already married, one of his officers dressed up as a priest and performed a marriage ceremony. Santa Anna then retired to enjoy a honeymoon.Edmondson (2000), p. 318. Juan Seguin left the Alamo as a courier on February 25, 1836. Santa Anna sent a messenger to tell Gaona to hurry to Bexar with his three best companies.Lord (1961), p. 110. At the time, the First Brigade was at San Ambrosio, a day's march north of the Rio Grande. According to the diary of Jose Enrique de la Pena, on this day carelessness led the Aldama Battalion's powder supply to catch fire, causing \\"considerable alarm\\".Todish et al. (1998), p. 44. Travis also wrote another letter requesting help. The Texian officers voted that Seguin should carry the message.Edmondson (2000), p. 319. Travis was adamant that Seguin remain behind, as his knowledge of the language, the countryside, and Mexican customs was invaluable. The Texians believed that none of the other couriers had made it through the Mexican lines,Myers (1948), p. 200. and told Travis that Seguin's knowledge of Spanish would also help him to avoid capture by Mexican patrols.Tinkle (1985), p. 149. Seguin, riding Bowie's horse, which was the fastest in the mission, and his aide Antonio Cruz left about 9 pm. Seguin did not expect to survive the mission; he and Cruz encountered a Mexican cavalry patrolEdmondson (2000), p. 320. but were able to escape using their knowledge of Spanish and the local terrain. After dark, a small party of Texians left the Alamo to burn down more of the huts; all were able to return to the Alamo without injury.Tinkle (1985), p. 122. Despite their efforts, several huts remained standing, and overnight the Mexican army was able to erect a battery only from the Alamo.Tinkle (1985), p. 121. An additional battery was erected at a location known as old Powderhouse, to the southeast of the Alamo. The Mexican army now had artillery stationed on three sides of the Alamo. Historian Walter Lord said that in the evening several Mexicans left the Alamo and asked to surrender to Santa Anna; they were told that Santa Anna had retired for the evening and could not be disturbed.Lord (1961), p. 111. February 26-27 Residents of Bexar were able to come into or near the Alamo in the first few days of the siege. Seguin's meals had even been delivered by a local, Estaban Pacheco.Lord (1961), p. 108. During the first week of the siege over 200 Mexican cannon shots landed in the Alamo plaza. The Texians often picked up the cannonballs and reused them.Petite (1999), p. 34. Although the Texians had matched Mexican artillery fire, on February 26, Travis ordered the artillery to stop firing to conserve powder and shot. Crockett and his men were encouraged to keep shooting, as they rarely missed and thus didn't waste shot.Hardin (1994), p. 132. Through the early days of the siege, the Texians didn't bother to take cover, as the Mexicans were too far out of their range to cause harm with their muskets; any Mexican soldier who ventured within of the Alamo, however, risked death or injury.Lord (1961), p. 116. A blue norther blew in that evening and dropped the temperature to 39 degrees F. Neither army was prepared for the cold temperatures. Several Texians ventured out to gather firewood but returned empty-handed after encountering Mexican skirmishers. On the evening of February 26, the Texians burned more huts, these located near the San Luis Potos√≠ Battalion. Santa Anna sent Colonel Juan Bringas to engage the Texians, and according to Edmondson, one Texian was killed.Edmondson (2000), p. 325. On February 26, news of the siege finally reached acting governor James W. Robinson, who immediately sent a courier to find Sam Houston.Lindley (2003), p. 102. Travis's messengers were having small successes. Albert Martin had reached Gonzales, the most westerly community of Texians, on February 25, the day after Sutherland and Smith had arrived with Travis's first message.Myers (1948), p. 201. As couriers delivered the messages to other settlements, reinforcements assembled in Gonzales, waiting for Fannin to arrive with more troops so they could travel together.Tinkle (1985), p. 162. In Gonzales itself, Robert \\"Three-Legged Willie\\" Williamson began a recruitment drive.Lindley (2003), p. 124. In Bastrop, Edward Burleson began organizing a militia, which likely left for Gonzales on February 27,Lindley (2003), p. 125. arriving the following day.Lindley (2003), p. 127. Unbeknownst to the Texians, Colonel James Fannin had finally decided to ride to their relief. Historian Robert Scott suggests that the trip was initiated after Fannin's objections were overridden by his officers.Scott (2000), p. 99. On the morning of February 26, he set out with 320 men, 4 cannon, and several supply wagons for the march from Goliad to the Alamo. The Goliad garrison had no horses to move the wagons and artillery and were forced to rely on oxen. Barely into their journey, one of the wagons broke down, and the expedition stopped for repairs.Edmondson (2000), p. 324. The group then took six hours to cross the waist-deep water of the San Antonio River. By the time they reached the other side it was dark, and the men camped along the river. The cold front reached Goliad that evening, and the poorly-dressed soldiers were \\"quickly chilled and miserable\\" in the driving rain.Scott (2000), p. 100. On awakening, Fannin realized that all of the Texian oxen had wandered off, and that his men had neglected to pack food for the journey.Edmondson (2000), p. 328. It took most of the day for the men to round up the oxen; after two days of travel, Fannin's men had not even ventured from their fort.Nofi (1992), p. 95. In a letter to Acting Governor James Robinson, Fannin said that his officers approached him to ask that the rescue trip be cancelled, as they had received word that General Urrea's army was marching towards Goliad. The officers and men in the expedition claimed that Fannin decided on his own to abort the mission. Several of the men agreed with the decision, with Dr. Barnard writing in his journal, \\"With but three or four hundred men, mostly on foot, with but a limited supply of provisions, to march a distance of nearly one-hundred miles through uninhabited country for the purpose of relieving a fortress beleaguered by five-thousand men was madness!\\"Scott (2000), p. 101. Before initially leaving Goliad, Fannin sent a courier to Gonzales to instruct Williamson to rendezvous at Cibolo Creek, halfway between Gonzales and San Antonio just north of present day La Vernia. On February 28, about 60 men, including Captain Albert Martin, travelled the from Gonzales to Cibolo Creek to wait for Fannin and his men.Lindley (2003), p. 128. Lindley speculates that Fannin sent an advance relief force under Captain John Chenoweth and Francis de Sauque to scout the area around Bexar. The advance force reached as far as the Seguin ranch, gathering corn, cattle, horses, and mules, then turned back to wait along Cibolo Creek for the remainder of Fannin's force.Lindley (2003), p. 124.Lindley (2003), p. 123. Several residents had seen Fannin march from Goliad and sent messengers to Bexar to inform Santa Anna that Fannin and 300 men were headed for the Alamo. Santa Anna ordered Colonel Juan Almonte and 800 dragoons to intercept the Texian relief force.Scott (2000), p. 102. Unaware of Fannin's attempted relief mission, Travis sent James Bonham to Goliad to persuade him.Todish et al. (1998), p. 45. Bonham was asked to tie a white handkerchief around his hat when he returned so that the Texians would know to open the gates for him.Tinkle (1985), p. 148. Much of the Mexican army's provisions were in the rear of the convoy with Gaona and Filisola. Santa Anna had hoped to restock his army's supplies in Bexar, but were unable to find much.Lord (1961), p. 118. He finally asked a local citizen, Manuel Menchaca, to help them find food; Menchaca led the army to the Seguin and Flores ranches and stole all of their corn, beef, and hogs.Lord (1961), p. 119. Santa Anna sent more couriers to Gaona and Filisola to urge them to hurry; Filisola was still at the Rio Grande. During the day the Mexican army tried to block the irrigation ditch leading into the Alamo. Texian Green Jameson tasked the men in the Alamo with finishing a well at the south end of the plaza. Although the men hit water, they weakened an earth and timber parapet by the low barracks; the mound collapsed, leaving no way to fire safely over that wall.Nofi (1992), p. 102. The same day Texians spotted a Mexican general surrounded by aides and dragoons and fired, but did not hit any of them. The Texians did not realize it was Santa Anna. Lord (1961), p. 117. February 28 - March 2 Digital reproduction of the Come and Take It flag. After learning that Fannin was not coming and that there would likely be no other reinforcements, a group of 25 men set out from Gonzales at 2 pm on Saturday, February 27.Lord (1961), p. 126. They were led by Martin and George Kimbell, Almaron Dickinson's business partner.Edmondson (2000), p. 338. As the group passed the ranch of volunteer John G. King on their way out of town his fifteen-year-old son, Wiliam, rushed out and asked to take his father's place, as John King was needed to support the family's nine children. The men agreed, and William exchanged places with his father.Lord (1961), p. 127. On the march to Bexar eight additional men joined the group.Hardin (1961), p. 133. The men carried with them the first flag ever made for use in a Texian battle; the Come and take it flag from the Battle of Gonzales.Tinkle (1985), p. 163. According to Lindley, Martin, Smith, and at least 34 other men chose not to wait for Fannin but continued on towards Bexar. The men from Bastrop and some of the others from Gonzales decided to wait, including Edwin T. Mitchell, Fannin's courier.Lindley (2003), p. 130. By the night of February 27, Travis sent Samuel G. Bastian to go to Gonzales \\"to hurry up reinforcements\\". According to Lindley, Bastian ran across Martin's men from Gonzales and volunteered to lead them to the Alamo. In an interview several years later, Bastian said that the group encountered a roving patrol of Mexican soldiers. Four of the men, including Bastian, became separated from the larger group and were forced to hide. However, Juan Almonte's journal did not mention any firing by Mexican soldiers that evening. The following year, Santa Anna'a secretary Roman Martinez Caro did report firing by Mexican lines {in 1837} that \\"two small reinforcements from Gonzales that succeeded in breaking through our lines and entering the fort. The first consisted of four men who gained the fort one night, and the second was a party of twenty-five\\".Lindley (2003), p. 131. Edmondson relates a different version of the campaign. According to his research, as the Gonzales men approached the Alamo in the early hours of March 1 a rider appeared in front of them and asked, in English, if they wished to go into the fort. When they said yes, he turned and told them to follow him. When one of the men became suspicious, the rider bolted away. The volunteers were afraid they had been discovered and galloped towards the Alamo. All of the versions agree that in the darkness, the Texians thought this was a party of Mexican soldiers and fired, wounding one of the volunteers. They finally managed to convince the defenders to open the gates.Edmondson (2000), p. 340. The reinforcements likely carried a letter from Williamson with news that men were assembling in Gonzales and would join Fannin in coming to their rescue.Lindley (2003), p. 133. Other Texian militias were preparing to march to the Alamo. In Victoria, Colonel Wharton was preparing to cross the Guadalupe River, while in San Felipe, Captain Mosely Baker ordered the local militia to prepare to march on February 29.Lord (1961), p. 130. Seguin recruited an additional 25 Tejanos, and Dr. Sutherland and Horace Alsbury, husband of Juana Navarro Alsbury, recruited 12 more men and set out on February 28 for Cibolo in the hopes of meeting Fannin. Meanwhile, Bonham had spoken with Fannin, who again declined to relieve the Alamo. Bonham then went to Gonzales, only to find that most of the men who weren't at the Alamo had gone to the constitutional convention. He did meet nineteen-year-old Ben Highsmith, who had left the Alamo as a courier before Santa Anna's arrival.Lord (1961), p. 133. Highsmith had tried to return to the Alamo but had been chased for by Mexican cavalry; he told Bonham that no one could get through the Mexican lines. Despite the warning, on March 2 Bonham crossed the Guadalupe en route to the Alamo.Lord (1961), p. 134. Unbeknownst to both the Mexican and Texian soldiers, on March 2, delegates to the Convention of 1836 adopted the Texas Declaration of Independence; the Texians were now fighting for the new Republic of Texas.Todish et al. (1998), p. 46. That evening, the Convention finally received Travis's letter of February 25. Shortly thereafter, they received word that Fannin had departed Goliad for the Alamo. Believing that the Alamo would be adequately reinforced, the delegates took no further action.Edmondson (2000), pp. 345-6. During this time period, the Mexican army continued to venture nearer the Alamo. By February 29, the Allende Infantry Battalion was stationed on the east side of the complex, while the Jim√©nez Battalion guarded the left, along the road to Gonzales. Texian sharpshooters remained on alert, and on the evening of February 29 killed Private First Class Secundino Alvarez, who had been ordered to ride near the Alamo to reconnoiter the defenses. On the afternoon of March 2, Santa Anna himself conducted a scouting trip. He discovered a road near the Alamo and moved the Jim√©nez Battalion to guard it. March 3 Bonham arrived near Bexar around 11 am on March 3. Wearing a white bandana in his hat to notify the Texians that he was one of them, he spurred his horse and rode, unmolested, through the Alamo gate as the ring of Mexican soldiers looked on in surprise. Bonham's news, that Fannin was not coming after all, reportedly demoralized the Alamo garrison. Travis sent a courier that evening to the Convention with news that the Texians had thus far survived the siege with no losses. He warned, however, that: \\"I look to the colonies alone for aid; unless it arrives soon, I shall have to fight the enemy on his own terms. I will, however, do the best I can under the circumstances, and I feel confident that the determined valour and desperate courage, heretofore evinced by my men, will not fail them in the last struggle, and although they may be sacrificed to the vengeance of a Gothic enemy, the victory will cost the enemy so dear, that it will be worse for him than a defeat.\\"Todish et al. (1998), p. 48. Travis ended his letter with news that despite the dearth of ammunition, his men would fire the 18-lb cannon three times each day as proof that they still held the fort. Travis then wrote several private lettersEdmondson (2000), p. 351. and entrusted all of the communications to John W. Smith, who volunteered to sneak through the enemy lines.Edmondson (2000), p. 352. According to Lindley's research, other Texians were also determined to join those at the Alamo. He identified up to 50 of Fannin's men, most of whom had been in Thomas H. Breece's company of New Orleans Greys, who left Goliad to go to the rescue of their former mates.Lindley (2003), p. 137. Lindley believes that on March 3 these men likely joined the advance unit under Chenoweth and Desauque, as well as Seguin and his Tejano unit. That afternoon, the entire group joined the group waiting at Cibolo Creek, from the Alamo.Lindley (2003), p. 138. At this point, Lindley calculated that the Alamo should have had approximately 164 effective men.Lindley (2003), p. 139. On the afternoon of March 3, reinforcements arrived for Santa Anna's army. The Zapadores, Aldama, and Toluca battalions arrived between 4 and 5 pm, after marching steadily for days. The Texians watched from the walls as approximately 1000 Mexican troops, attired in dress uniform, marched into Bexar's military plaza. The Mexican army celebrated loudly throughout the afternoon, both in honor of their reinforcements and at the news that troops under General Jose de Urrea had soundly defeated Texian Colonel Frank W. Johnson at the Battle of San Patricio on February 27. Most of the Texians in the Alamo had believed that Ramirez y Sesma had been leading the Mexican forces during the siege, and they mistakenly attributed the celebration to the arrival of Santa Anna. The reinforcements brought the number of Mexican soldiers in Bexar to almost 2,400.Edmondson (2000), p. 349. During the day, the Mexican army had erected a battery on the north side of the Alamo, within musket shot of the complex walls.Todish et al. (1998), p. 47. Unlike previous bombardments, each shot from this battery impacted the walls, causing them to begin to crumble. By nightfall, part of the wall had begun to collapse, and Jameson kept the men working all night to shore up the walls with pieces of lumber.Hardin (1994), p. 136. Almonte's journal reported that there was an engagement after dark on March 3, but that the Mexican troops had repulsed the assault.Lindley (2003), p. 143. Several historians, including Walter Lord, speculated that the Texians were creating a diversion to allow Smith to escape.Lord (1960), p. 143. However, in 1876, Susannah Dickinson said that Travis sent three men out shortly after dark on March 3, probably in response to the arrival of the Mexican reinforcements. The three men, who Dickinson believed included Davy Crockett, were sent to find Fannin.Lindley (2003), p. 140. Lindley stated that just before midnight, Crockett and one of the other men found the force of Texians waiting along Cibolo Creek, who had advanced to within of the Alamo. Just before daylight on March 4, part of the Texian force managed to break through the Mexican lines and enter the Alamo. A second group was driven across the prairie by Mexican soldiers.Lindley (2003), p. 142. Lindley based his assumptions on two newspaper reports published within a month of the Alamo's fall that stated that 50 men had reinforced the Alamo a few days before the final assault. March 4-5 The Mexican bombardment recommenced early on March 4. That afternoon, Santa Anna called a council of war with his senior officers. He proposed an imminent attack on the fort. Many of his officers disagreed, recommending instead that they wait for the arrival of the heavy artillery. Two 12-lb cannons, with the capability to quickly destroy the Alamo walls, were due to arrive in Bexar on Monday, March 7. According to later reports by Filisola, on the evening of March 4, a woman from Bexar informed Santa Anna that Travis and his men were planning to either surrender or escape if reinforcements did not arrive quickly.Edmondson (2000), p. 355. Many years later, Susannah Dickinson commented that Juana Alsbury left the fort that evening; Dickinson believed that Alsbury had deserted to provide Santa Anna with information about the Texian troop strength. Edmondson notes that Alsbury returned to the Alamo, and he speculates that Travis sent her to try to negotiate an honorable surrender for the Texian troops. According to Todish, \\"More than one historian, and even some of Santa Anna's own officers, have speculated that this information is what prompted him to push for an immediate assault rather than wait for his heavy siege guns. There would have been little glory in a bloodless victory, and glory is what Santa Anna craved above all else.\\"Todish et al. (1998), p. 49. Saturday, March 5, marked a brief departure from the frigid temperatures of the preceding days, as the air warmed to between 50 and 68 degrees F. That morning, Santa Anna called another staff meeting and announced that the assault would commence the following day. Again, officers advocated waiting for the arrival of the heavy artillery. According to his aide, Fernando Urissa, Santa Anna responded \\"What are the lives of soldiers than so many chickens? I tell you, the Alamo must fall, and my orders must be obeyed at all hazards. If our soldiers are driven back, the next line in their rear must force those before them forward, and compel them to scale the walls, cost what it may.\\"Edmondson (2000), p. 356. The decision made, General Juan Valent√≠n Amador drew up detailed battle orders. The orders instructed all men to wear shoes or sandals and to properly tie their shako chin-straps. Despite the cold, soldiers were prohibited from wearing cloaks or blankets, as these might limit their movements on the battlefield. Each soldier would receive either 4 or 6 rounds of ammunition and would be given 2 flints.Todish et al. (1998), p. 50. Mexican soldiers would be divided into four columns. Cos would command the first column, consisting of the Aldama Battlation and three companies of the San Luis Battalion. The remaining rifle companies of the San Luis Battalion, as well as the Toluca Battalion, would be under the command of Colonel Francisco Duque. A third column, commanded by Colonel Jose Maria Romero, comprised the rifle companies from the Matamoros and Jim√©nez Battalions. The scouting companies of the Matamoros, Jim√©nez, and San Luis Battalions would form the fourth column, under Juan Morales. Santa Anna would command the reserve force, primarily the grenadier companies from each of the battalions. The cavalry would guard the camp and patrol the area around the battlefield to stop any soldier, Texian or Mexican, who attempted to desert. Although not explicitly codified in the orders, Santa Anna ensured that the presidial troops who had previously been stationed in Bexar did not take part in the fighting; this would ensure that relatives were not forced to fight each other. That evening, James Allen became the last courier to leave the Alamo, carrying messages from Travis and several of the other men.Edmondson (2000), p. 360. Legend holds that at some point on March 5, Travis gathered his men and explained that an attack was likely imminent, and that the Mexican Army would likely prevail. He supposedly drew a line in the sand and asked those willing to die for the Texian cause to cross and stand alongside him. A bedridden Bowie requested that Crockett and several others carry his cot over the line, leaving only one man, Louis \\"Moses\\" Rose on the other side. Explaining that he was not yet ready to die, Rose escaped that evening. This episode was first mentioned in a newspaper article written thirty-five years after the Alamo fell by a reporter who said his parents heard the story directly from Rose.Hopewell (1994), p. 126. The reporter had admitted to embellishing pieces of the article, and as Rose had died by the time the story was published, so the story could not be authenticated.Chariton (1992), p. 195. Years after the story was published, Alamo survivors Susannah Dickinson and Enrique Esparza mentioned the incident, but many details conflicted.Groneman (1996), pp. 122, 150, 184. At 10 pm, the Mexican artillery ceased their bombardment. As Santa Anna had planned, the exhausted Texians soon fell into a deep sleep, the first uninterrupted sleep many had gotten since the siege began.Todish et al. (1998), p. 51. Three Texians were sent to act as sentries outside the walls.Hardin (1994), p. 138. March 6 At midnight, Mexican soldiers began silently moving towards their places to await the start of battle. The Texian sentries were surprised and killed quickly before they could raise an alarm.Hardin (1994), p. 139. Despite the orders to forgo overcoats, cloaks, and blankets, the men were instructed to lay on their stomachs on the cold, damp grass.Edmondson (2000), p. 362. Although the original orders gave the battle starting time as 4 am, the soldiers were not completely in place until about 5 am. Some were stationed within of the Alamo. At 5:30 am, Santa Anna gave the order for the advance, and his excited troops began shouting \\"Viva Santa Anna, Viva la republica!\\" The shouting woke the Texians, but by the time they reached their posts the Mexican soldiers were already within musket range.

At the same time as the album The Biggest Piano in Town was commercially released in the U.S. and Canada, Grand Pianoramax went on a ten- city tour in the U.S. opening for Maceo Parker and then performed at festivals in Europe (most notably at a showcase night featuring the Andy Milne & Gregoire Maret duo, and Grand Pianoramax with Spleen & Bleubird at the 2008 Montreux Jazz Festival). Zurich-based Dominik Burkhalter had become the official drummer for the band. Grand Pianoramax's third album, Smooth Danger, was recorded and mixed between Mumbai, Berlin, Paris and Bristol (and mastered by Shawn Joseph, collaborator of Portishead). It was released in Europe and the U.S. in October 2010, and featured long-time collaborators Mike Ladd, Black Cracker, and for the first time Karsh Kale on tabla. Leo Tardin Leo Tardin, a native of Geneva, Switzerland, won the first Montreux Jazz Festival International Solo Piano Competition in 1999. He graduated from New School University in 2000 and spent ten in New York City. He moved to Berlin in 2009 for the production of his third album. He has performed with musicians like Roy Ayers, Frank Morgan, Toots Thielemans, Charles Tolliver, Dave Liebman, Enrico Rava, Maria Jo√£o, Erik Truffaz, Gregoire Maret and Paula Oliveira.

The low on-resistance property of a MOSFET reduces ohmic losses compared to the diode rectifier (below 32 A in this case), which exhibits a significant voltage drop even at very low current levels. Paralleling two MOSFETs (pink curve) reduces the losses further, whereas paralleling several diodes won't significantly reduce the forward- voltage drop. Active rectification, or synchronous rectification, is a technique for improving the efficiency of rectification by replacing diodes with actively controlled switches, usually power MOSFETs or power BJTs. Whereas normal semiconductor diodes have a roughly fixed voltage drop of around 0.5-1 volts, active rectifiers behave as resistances, and can have arbitrarily low voltage drop. Historically, vibrator driven switches or motor- driven commutators have also been used for mechanical rectifiers and synchronous rectification. Active rectification has many applications. It is frequently used for arrays of photovoltaic panels to avoid reverse current flow that can cause overheating with partial shading while giving minimum power loss. It is also used in switched-mode power supplies (SMPS).  Motivation  Plot of power dissipated vs. current in 4 devices. The constant voltage drop of a standard p-n junction diode is typically between 0.7 V and 1.7 V, causing significant power loss in the diode. Electric power depends on current and voltage: the power loss rises proportional to both current and voltage. In low voltage converters (around 10 volts and less), the voltage drop of a diode (typically around 0.7 to 1 volt for a silicon diode at its rated current) has an adverse effect on efficiency. One classic solution replaces standard silicon diodes with Schottky diodes, which exhibit very low voltage drops (as low as 0.3 volts). However, even Schottky rectifiers can be significantly more lossy than the synchronous type, notably at high currents and low voltages. When addressing very low-voltage converters, such as a buck converter power supply for a computer CPU (with a voltage output around 1 volt, and many amperes of output current), Schottky rectification does not provide adequate efficiency. In such applications, active rectification becomes necessary.  Description  Replacing a diode with an actively controlled switching element such as a MOSFET is the heart of active rectification. MOSFETs have a constant very low resistance when conducting, known as on-resistance (RDS(on)). They can be made with an on-resistance as low as 10 mŒ© or even lower. The voltage drop across the transistor is then much lower, meaning a reduction in power loss and a gain in efficiency. However, Ohm's law governs the voltage drop across the MOSFET, meaning that at high currents, the drop can exceed that of a diode. This limitation is usually dealt with either by placing several transistors in parallel, thereby reducing the current through each individual one, or by using a device with more active area (on FETs, a device-equivalent of parallel). The control circuitry for active rectification usually uses comparators to sense the voltage of the input AC and open the transistors at the correct times to allow current to flow in the correct direction. The timing is very important, as a short circuit across the input power must be avoided and can easily be caused by one transistor turning on before another has turned off. Active rectifiers also clearly still need the smoothing capacitors present in passive examples. Using active rectification to implement AC/DC conversion allows a design to undergo further improvements (with more complexity) to achieve an active power factor correction, which forces the current waveform of the AC source to follow the voltage waveform, eliminating reactive currents and allowing the total system to achieve greater efficiency.  Ideal diode  A MOSFET actively controlled to act as a rectifier‚Äîactively turned on to allow current in one direction but actively turned off to block current from flowing the other direction‚Äîis sometimes called an ideal diode. Using ideal diodes rather than a standard diodes for solar electric panel bypass, reverse-battery protection, or bridge rectifier reduces the amount of power dissipated in those diodes, improving efficiency and reducing the size of the PC board and weight of the heat sink required to deal with that power dissipation. \\"Ideal Diode for Solar Panel Bypass\\". \\"Ideal Diode Bridge Controller\\". \\"Ideal Diode Bridge Controller Minimizes Power Loss & Heat in PoE Powered Devices\\" \\"Reverse-Current Circuitry Protection\\". \\"Reverse Current/Battery Protection Circuits\\". \\"Reverse Power Protection using Power MOSFETs\\". Such a MOSFET-based ideal diode is not to be confused with an op-amp based super diode.  Construction  See H-bridge.  References  Further reading  *T. Grossen, E. Menzel, J.J.R. Enslin.

After returning to find his son, Sandro, grown some years. He finds his wife, Patrizia, had some difficulty during his 6 years away. He also meets the Professor, their new next-door neighbor who lost his wife and daughter in the bombings of Napoli. After readjusting to his new life at home, Paolo is frightened when Patrizia suddenly disappears. After searching through Rome with the Professor, he finally finds her in custody at the police station. She has been accused of murdering a man. Patrizia admits to Paolo that during the desperate war years, she prostituted herself to pay for medicine to keep Sandro alive. Paolo is at first outraged and pushes her away. He even tried to confess to the murder to spare Patrizia, despite the advice of the investigator not to. Patrizia is eventually acquitted of the murder, but Paolo admits to wanting to leave her.

This was not because the director Mattoli wished to follow neorealist style, which he largely rejected.Gundle p.272 Interior scenes were shot at the Palatino Studios in Rome. The film was important in Giachetti's transition from one of the leading stars of the Fascist era into a figure acceptable to post-war audiences. This was partly achieved through retaining his previously strongly masculine persona which was adapted to the new conditions. Alida Valli, also a celebrated Fascist period star, received a boost from the film and went to Hollywood the following year. ReferencesBibliography * Bayman, Louis (ed.)

Eleutherius was probably named bishop of Tournai after St. Remigius organized the church hierarchy of northern Gaul at the end of the fifth century. Some sermons on the Trinity, Nativity, and the feast of the Annunciation (Bibliotheca Patrum, vol. XV) are falsely attributed to him. Martyrdom Eleutherius is venerated as a martyr although this legend is considered an invention of the canon priest Henri of Tournai, who wrote a vita of Eleutherius in 1141. At the end of the 11th century the Church of Tournai had been trying to become independent from the diocese of Noyon, and Henri had been motivated by the need to prove the antiquity of the Church of Tournai.

Henri's account states that Eleutherius was a native of Tournai who was born during the reign of Childeric I. Eleutherius' parents were Christians and were named Terenus and Blanda; Terenus was a descendant in the family of Irenaeus of Lyons. Persecutions of Christians forced the family to flee to a village named Blandinium (Blandain), but after the conversion of Clovis to Christianity, the family built a church at Blandinium (Blandain). Eleutherius eventually became bishop of Tournai, and was consulted by Pope Hormisdas on the matter of eradicating Arianism. Eleutherius convened a church council, and argued effectively against the Arians, who were angered by this. One day, as he was going to church, he was beaten up by a group of Arians and left for dead. He subsequently died from the wounds he received, on his death- bed confiding his flock to Medardus. The Reliquary Shrine of Saint Eleutherius, 1247, in the Cathedral of Tournai Veneration There exists a testimony recording the recovery of his relics during the episcopate of Bishop Hedilo of Tournai, in 897 or 898. Bishop Baudoin translated Eleutherius' relics in 1064 or 1065. Eleutherius' relics were translated again in 1247, when the great reliquary shrine was commissioned by Bishop Walter de Marvis. In its gable end St Eleutherius appears, holding his crozier in one hand and in the other a model of the cathedral with its five spires.

Community Living Ontario is a confederation of more than 105 local associations (known as affiliates)List of Community Living Ontario affiliates and part of the Canadian Association for Community Living. History Community Living Ontario was founded on April 27, 1953 as the Ontario Association for Retarded Children. In 1987, the name of the organization was changed to the Ontario Association for Community Living. In 2008, Community Living Ontario added eight new affiliates. In 2009, Community Living Ontario and its local affiliate members saw the closure of three remaining mass institutions for people with intellectual disabilities in Ontario. The Community Living movement is celebrated in Ontario every May with Community Living Month, highlighted by Community Living Day in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.Community Living Day 2013 Recognized In Legislature of Ontario Advocacy The organization has been noted by a book as \\"one of the most influential advocacy groups in Canada\\" for people with intellectual disabilities.Chupik, Jessa. \\"Fires Burning: Advocacy, Camping and Children with Learning Disabilities in Ontario 1950‚Äì1990\\", in Exploring Experiences of Advocacy by People with Learning Disabilities: Testimonies of Resistance, Duncan Mitchell, et al., eds. (2006). p. 121. . It promotes inclusive education so that people with intellectual disabilities can \\"go with their neighbourhood friends, to their neighbourhood schools where they further their growth and development together.\\". It also advocates for the inclusion of individuals with intellectual disabilities in all aspects of community life.Ferguson, Derek. \\"A coalition representing the disabled has attacked Ontario's education ministry over a school board's refusal to allow a 15-year- old girl with cerebral palsy to attend regular classes\\", Toronto Star, 1989-09-15, p. A7. This includes advocating for de-institutionalization, with a major milestone realized in 2009 when Minister of Community and Social Services Madeleine Meilleur proclaimed the closure of Rideau, Huronia and the Southwest Regional Centres. On April 1, 2009 Community Living held its 10th Annual Day at the Legislature, where close to 300 people‚Äîincluding people who have an intellectual disability, their families and friends, volunteers, and staff of Community Living associations, and other community advocates‚Äîjoined together at Queen's Park to celebrate the closures and the dawning of a new era in Ontario.The End Of An Era - Closure On Ontario Institutions In advocating for de-institutionalization one of Community Living Ontario's current concerns is the trend toward placements in nursing homes. According to Professor Patricia Spindel, a senior adviser to the organization, people with intellectual disabilities are being increasingly funneled into nursing homes instead of other more appropriate housing options. Community Living Ontario was also an important contributor to Bill 77, the \\"Services and Supports to Promote the Social Inclusion of Persons with Developmental Disabilities Act\\" of 2008. Seven of the fifteen recommendations made by the organization to the Government of Ontario were adopted. \\"We're very encouraged to see the concept of social inclusion named in this legislation,\\" said Dianne Garrels-Munro, past president of Community Living Ontario.

He rose to fame during the Battle of Gettysburg, where he led the defense of a portion of Culp's Hill on July 3, 1863. A monument on the Gettysburg Battlefield commemorates the spot as \\"Pardee Field.\\" Early life Ario (Ariovistus) Pardee Jr. was the eldest child of Ariovistus Pardee, a capitalist who founded Hazleton, Pennsylvania,\\"Ario Pardee's Death,\\" New York Times, Mar 28, 1892. p. 1. and Elizabeth Jacobs. He was born in Hazleton on October 28, 1839. In 1847, his mother died in childbirth. The following year, his father married Anna Maria Robison, the family's governess. Pardee trained as a civil engineer at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. After graduating in 1858, he became involved in running his father‚Äôs anthracite coal mines. By the outbreak of the war, he was married to Mary Allison. Their only child was stillborn during the Civil War. Ario Pardee Jr. had no direct descendants. Civil War in the East Pardee Field, at the Gettysburg Battlefield Pardee joined the 28th Pennsylvania Infantry on June 28, 1861. It was encamped at Camp Coleman in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in July while completing organization.Johnston, pp. 146-147. After serving as captain of Company A, organized by his father,\\"Obituary Notes,\\" New York Times, Mar 17, 1901. p. 7. he was named major on November 1 of that year. (Col John W. Geary had been made a brigadier general, and Pardee was among those promoted in the follow-up to that promotion.)Blair, p. 43 n. 9. Pardee served under Geary in the Shenandoah Valley, when MG Nathaniel Banks was bested by Stonewall Jackson. Pardee criticized Geary's actions in that campaign, especially his abandoning Thoroughfare Gap in the face of a Confederate advance. Apparently, Pardee thought a force of 5,000 federals could withstand a force of 28,000 Confederates. His reasons for this opinion are unclear to this day.Blair, p. 45. Pardee thought Geary overestimated dangers confronting him. (Geary's actions may have been the wiser, since both survived the war.)Blair, p. 53 n. 24; Johnston, p. 192. While serving under MG John Pope in Virginia, Pardee missed the Battle of Cedar Mountain; and Banks' command was not engaged at the Second Battle of Bull Run, being detailed to guard the rear of Pope's army. It only did some skirmishing after the battle had ended.Johnston, p. 212. At the rank of major, Pardee led the regiment at the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, serving in the brigade of Lt. Col. Hector Tyndale in Second Division of the XII Corps. Ario escaped uninjured, despite having a horse shot out from under him.Johnston, pp. 172, 218. BG George S. Greene, the division commander, commended Pardee for his conduct at Antietam. Pardee even took command of the brigade briefly, because Tyndale had been wounded. Shortly thereafter, on October 9 of that year, some companies of the 28th became part of the new 147th Pennsylvania Infantry, together with three newly recruited companies. Pardee was named lieutenant colonel and commander of the new regiment. Pardee next saw combat in the Battle of Chancellorsville, where he led the regiment in the brigade of Col. Charles Candy in the Second Division of BG John White Geary, his former regimental commander. He retained command at the Battle of Gettysburg, during which he was engaged in the fighting on Culp's Hill on July 2, and July 3, 1863. A field on Culp‚Äôs Hill has been named for him, as a sign painted on a stone shows. The 147th Pennsylvania faced that field during the fighting on July 3, as XII Corps tried to win back ground lost to the Confederate troops of Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell on the day before. (Geary was ordered away by Gen Meade with two brigades on July 2, to assist in the battle on the left flank. Instead of going to reinforce the army's endangered left as intended, Geary mistakenly took Candy's command and Thomas L. Kane's brigade out of the battle for the rest of the day.) Their foes resumed the previous day's efforts to carry Culp‚Äôs Hill by attacking up hill.Sears, p. 364. Pardee was told by Geary to maintain a steady volume of fire on the Confederates. This aided the repulse of the last attack of BG George H. Steuart's brigade across the field. The volume of fire, however, was such that ammunition became scarce. By 11:00 AM the Confederate attacks ended. The report of Col Charles Candy that Pardee's regiment advanced to the wall on the opposite side of the contested field is not supported by other accounts by credible witnesses.Gottfried, pp. 381-382; Pfanz, p. 456 n. 36. Civil War in the West Monument on Lookout Mountain dedicated to the 12th Corps, which Pardee commanded. Pardee went west with the rest of XII Corps and XI Corps, which had been sent to the relief of the Army of the Cumberland, besieged in Chattanooga, Tennessee by the Confederate Army of Tennessee. The regiment participated in the Battle of Wauhatchie, the Battle of Lookout Mountain and the Battle of Ringgold Gap while under the overall command of Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker. Pardee, ordinarily a critic of Geary, praised his division commander's conduct at Wauhatchie.Blair, p. 130; Johnston, p. 269. Pardee was promoted to the rank of colonel on March 19, 1864.Johnston, pp. 288-289. He then led the regiment in Col Candy's brigade in Brig. Gen. John W. Geary‚Äôs second division XX Corps in the Army of the Cumberland. This corps had been created out of XI Corps, XII Corps and some garrison troops. Hooker commanded the corps at the beginning of Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman‚Äôs Atlanta Campaign. At the Battle of Peachtree Creek, Pardee's regiment held its ground against attacking Confederate forces while the regiments either side of it retreated. The 147th suffered heavy losses, and Pardee complained that his right flank was thrown into disorder by routed troops.McDonough and Jones, pp. 215-216. Ario's cousin, Isaiah Platt, was also killed at this battle. They were in the same Infantry formation. After Colonel Candy was mustered out of the service, Pardee usually led the first brigade of Geary‚Äôs Division in the later stages of the Atlanta Campaign, the March to the Sea and the Carolinas Campaign. During that latter campaign, XX Corps became part of Maj. Gen. Henry Warner Slocum‚Äôs Army of Georgia. Pardee's last major battle as a brigade commander was the Battle of Bentonville in North Carolina. Pardee received promotion to the brevet rank of brigadier general on January 12, 1865, for the Battle of Peachtree Creek. He was discharged from the service on June 13 of that year. Postbellum activities After the Civil War, Pardee returned to Pennsylvania. There he went back into the coal business as a partner with his father and his brother Calvin. Ario Jr. was not heavily involved in the management of these enterprises. That fell to his father and then to brothers Calvin and Frank. Colonel Pardee's health seems to have been undermined by war service, which would explain his passive role.Johnston, p. 328. He also had interests in railroads and belonged to the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Mary Pardee predeceased her husband, and he grew testy in old age. Ario Pardee Jr. died at Wyncote, Pennsylvania, on March 16, 1901. He was buried in the churchyard of St. Paul‚Äôs Episcopal Church in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania.

She searches for memories from her past and investigates the dwindling Sephardic Jewish community that remains, estimated at less than 800 in 2011. Summary Ruth Behar was born in Havana, Cuba before the Cuban Revolution and was four years old when her family immigrated to the United States. She is a professor at the University of Michigan and travels to Havana to explore what remains of Jewish Cuba. As immigrants there in the early 20th century, her father and grandfather, Sephardi Jews from Turkey, once worked as peddlers in the city. Behar presents Danayda Levy as an example of the complex present of Cuban Jewry. Danayda's mother is a Jehovah's Witness, and her father Jose is president of the Sephardi Jewish center. She is interviewed with her sister while they are in their parents' apartment. Her sister now practices Santer√≠a, an Afro-Cuban creole religion developed by African slaves in the New World, and incorporating practices from historic Nigeria. Danayda is committed to Judaism and can read in Hebrew from the Torah with her father's help. Ruth Behar's mother was Ashkenazi, with relatives from Poland and Germany. Her father's family was Sephardic in ancestry and from Turkey. They told of being expelled from Spain in 1492 and making their way around the Mediterranean to the Ottoman Empire. The family left Turkey after the First World War and social disruption following break-up of the empire. \\"It is said that when our ancestors left Spain, they took the keys with them,\\" says Behar, \\"always believing in the possibility of return.\\" Given the Jewish abandonment of Havana, many elements of their history remain. Her parents‚Äô former apartment has not been changed; she finds the furniture where she remembered it. The Sephardic cemetery has numerous gravestones with the Behar name. On a street named Inquisador (Inquisitor), Behar visits the remains of her father's former temple. (At the time of the Revolution, there were five Jewish temples in Havana.) She asks, \\"Who am I in Cuba? A returning native, a reluctant anthropologist, or a tourist?\\" Reception The film received awards at some regional film festivals and was shown widely around the United States in college venues.

Lord until 1906 with works in Shepherd's Bush, then as Osborn & Co Ltd, and later as Osborn Engineering Company. In the 1920s they had a 2 acre factory at Lees Lane, Gosport, and were engaged in a wide range of engineering activities. They built motorcycles for Burney & Blackburne, then from 1922 produced them as OEC-Blackburne, then later just OEC. Initially they used Blackburne engines, but later used other engine manufacturers such as JAP. The Osborn Engineering Company went into receivership in 1931, and the extensive premises at Lees Lane, Gosport were auctioned by the receiver on 17 December 1931. Portsmouth Evening News, 28 Nov 1931, p2 However the motorcycle part of the business survived and by 1933 OEC motorcycles were being produced by O.E.C. Ltd of Portsmouth. During the Second World War, OEC ceased motorcycle production to concentrate on war work, but went back to motorcycle production before ceasing production in 1954.

Osborn and Lord had their works adjoining the Empire Theatre at Shepherd's Bush. Osborn & Co Ltd continued as UK agents and exhibited the Gregoire car at the Olympia Motor Show from 1906 to 1909.

This was a conventional motorcycle except in one striking aspect, it had a steering wheel instead of handlebars (with the steering wheel connected to the forks by worm and bevel gearing). In 1922 Burney & Blackburne Ltd ceased selling the Blackburne motorcycle, and instead focussed on engine sales. The Osborn Engineering Company - who had built the Blackburne motorcycles - took over the sales of the completed motorcycles marketing them as OEC-Blackburne, and later just OEC. The OEC-Blackburne stand at the 1922 show exhibited the same sidecar with steering wheel as in 1921 but as the OEC-BlackburneThe Olympia Show, The Motor Cycle, 30 November 1922, p839 Other OEC-Blackburne motorcycles on show in 1922 included a 349cc side-valve touring solo, a 348cc overhead-valve sports solo (also available with light sidecar), a 545cc single with sidecar, and 998cc V-twin sidecar models with either single and double seat sidecars. In 1927 OEC introduced its first bike with unusual patented duplex front fork system (e.g. US Patent No 1715246 and 1780034), and this was to be fitted to all their models. The next year they patented a novel rear swinging arm suspension design (US Patent No 1816788). At the 1929 Olympia show Osborn Engineering Company listed 350cc and 500cc motorcycles, in either side-valve or overhead-valve form, all with the unusual duplex fork arrangement. However the novel design was not a success, and the Osborn Engineering Company went into receivership in 1931, and their huge factory in Gosport was sold by the receiver and became Ashley's wallpaper factory. The motorcycle business was resurrected by a financial tie-up with dealers Glanfield and Lawrence in 1932Historic Gosport, https://historicgosport.uk/o-e-c-motorcycles/, as O.E.C. Ltd of Atlanta Works, Highbury Street, Portsmouth, and in 1934 in addition to motorcycles it announced a very unusual vehicle - the two wheel car. This was the brainchild of Mr Norman Frederick Wood, designer and director - and was in effect a motorcycle enclosed completely in a slender car type body with wheel steering, and tandem seating for two.Two Wheel Car Arrives, Daily Mirror, 6 July 1934, p4 By 1935 this unusual vehicle was being marketed as the Whitwood monocar, however it was not a success and was discontinued in 1936. The most famous model produced by the firm was the OEC Commander introduced in 1938, with a 500 cc single-cylinder Matchless engine, Girling brakes, sprung frame and duplex steering plus a claimed top speed of 80mph.Introducing the new 1939 OEC Commander, Chatham News. 20 Jan 1939, p2 During WW2 the works changed over to manufacturing aircraft undercarriage parts, however it was also involved with the rather strange and unsuccessful secret weapon know as the Great Panjandrum which will be familiar to devotees of \\"Dad's Army\\" as an imitation of it featured in an episode in 1972. The works was bombed during the war and when production restarted it was at Stramshaw Road, Portsmouth. In 1949 the company commenced production of the Atlanta, a lightweight machine with a choice of 122 cc or 197 cc Villiers engines, followed in 1951 by the Apollo, with a 248 cc side-valve Brockhouse engine. Neither of these postwar machines was successful and the company ceased production in 1954.  Speed Record  In the 1920s and 1930s there were numerous attempts at gaining the motorcycle speed record by various companies, and OEC was one of them. Their first success came about by teaming up with Claude Temple, who used the unusual OEC fork arrangement which had the virtue of great straight line stability (only a virtue if you want to go in a straight line!). Using a 996cc JAP engine in the OEC frame he gained the world speed record at Arpajon in France in 1926 at 121.44mph. The record stood until August 1928 when it was taken by a Brough Superior. On 31 August 1930 a motorcycle with a special OEC frame - the OEC- Temple-JAP - ridden by Joe Wright gained the world speed record at Arpajon, France, at 137.32mph.New World's Record, The Daily Mirror, 2 Sept 1930, p20 Less than a month later the record was taken by Ernste Hemme on a supercharged BMW to at Ingolstadt, Germany. OEC and Joe Wright set to regain the record in Cork in November 1930, and while the record was broken at 150.7mph on 6 November, and the OEC-Temple-JAP was exhibited as the record-breaker at the Olympia show - the truth turned out to be that the OEC developed an engine problem, and the record breaking ride was on a backup Zenith-JAP motorcycle. The Zenith company being in financial difficulties, and OEC paying for the record attempt, the facts got mis-reported. The truth did however come out fairly soon after the Olympia show.Wrong Machine Shown as Record Breaker, Birmingham Daily Gazette, 10 Dec 1930, p1 ReferencesFurther reading * Motorcycle manufacturers of the United Kingdom ","title":"Osborn Engineering Company"},{"id":"18635005","text":"The Macedonian Stock Exchange (MSE; Macedonian: –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∞ –±–µ—Ä–∑–∞, Makedonska berza) is the principal stock exchange in the Republic of North Macedonia, located in the capital city of Skopje.

Rumination is the focused attention on the symptoms of one's distress, and on its possible causes and consequences, as opposed to its solutions, according to the Response Styles Theory proposed by Nolen-Hoeksema (1998). Because the Response Styles Theory has been empirically supported, this model of rumination is the most widely used conceptualization. Other theories, however, have proposed different definitions for rumination. For example, in the Goal Progress Theory, rumination is conceptualized not as a reaction to a mood state, but as a \\"response to failure to progress satisfactorily towards a goal\\". As such, both rumination and worry are associated with anxiety and other negative emotional states; however, its measures have not been unified. Theories=Response styles theory Response styles theory (RST) initially defined rumination as passively and repetitively focusing on one's symptoms of depression and the possible causes and consequences of these symptoms. As evidence for this definition, rumination has been implicated in the development, maintenance, and aggravation of both depressive symptoms as well as episodes of major depression. Recently, RST has expanded the definition of rumination beyond depression to include passive and repetitive focus on the causes, consequences, and symptoms of one's distress in general. This change was made because rumination has been implicated in a host of disorders, not just depression. RST also contends that positive distraction is the healthy alternative to rumination, where focus is directed to positive stimuli instead of to distress. However, the literature suggests that positive distraction may not be as potent a tool as once thought. Specifically, the S-REF model defines rumination as \\"repetitive thoughts generated by attempts to cope with self- discrepancy that are directed primarily toward processing the content of self- referent information and not toward immediate goal-directed action.\\" Put more simply, when a person ruminates, he or she aims to answer questions such as: *How do I feel about this event? *How can I change my thoughts and feelings about the event? *How can I prevent disturbing thoughts and feelings in the future? However, in answering these questions, ruminators tend to focus on their emotions (i.e., \\"self-referent information\\") as opposed to problem solving (i.e., \\"goal-directed action\\"). Metacognition is also an important part of the S-REF model and helps to explain the link between rumination and depression. Specifically, those who hold positive metacognitive beliefs about the benefits of rumination (e.g., \\"I need to ruminate about the bad things that have happened in the past to make sense of them\\") are probably motivated to engage perseveratively in rumination. Once engagement in rumination has occurred, individuals' negative metacognitive beliefs about rumination are likely to be activated, seeing it as unpleasant (e.g., \\"Ruminating makes me physically ill\\"), uncontrollable (e.g., \\"Ruminating means I'm out of control\\"), and socially damaging. These negative metacognitive beliefs then contribute to the development and maintenance of depression. Goal progress theory Goal progress theory (GPT) seeks to explain rumination as a function of goal progress. Specifically, GPT views rumination as an example of the Zeigarnik Effect, which suggests that individuals are more likely to remember information from unfinished tasks than from finished tasks. From this understanding, GPT defines rumination as \\"the tendency to think recurrently about important, higher order goals that have not yet been attained\\" or towards which sufficient progress has not been made. GPT predicts that individuals for whom goal-related information is highly accessible should be more likely to ruminate. Various studies have provided support for this prediction. Pathology Extensive research on the effects of rumination, or the tendency to self-reflect, shows that the negative form of rumination (associated with dysphoria) interferes with people's ability to focus on problem-solving and results in dwelling on negative thoughts about past failures. Evidence from studies suggests that the negative implications of rumination are due to cognitive biases, such as memory and attentional biases, which predispose ruminators to selectively devote attention to negative stimuli. The tendency to negatively ruminate is a stable constant over time and serves as a significant risk factor for clinical depression. Not only are habitual ruminators more likely to become depressed, but experimental studies have demonstrated that people who are induced to ruminate experience greater depressed mood. There is also evidence that rumination is linked to general anxiety, post traumatic stress, binge drinking, eating disorders, and self- injurious behavior. Rumination was originally believed to predict the duration of depressive symptoms. In other words, ruminating about problems was presumed to be a form of memory rehearsal which was believed to actually lengthen the experience of depression. The evidence now suggests that although rumination contributes to depression, it is not necessarily correlated with the duration of symptoms. Types and content of thoughts Theories of rumination differ in their predictions regarding the content of ruminative thoughts based on their respective conceptualizations. Some models propose that rumination is focused on negative feeling states and/or the circumstances surrounding that emotion (RST, rumination on sadness, Trapnell and Campbell, stress-reactive rumination, post-event processing models). Rumination in other models focuses on discrepancies between one's current and desired status (goal progress, conceptual evaluative model of rumination). Finally, other models propose that it is the negative themes of uncontrollability and harm in metacognitions that are most important. Some common thoughts that are characteristic of ruminative responses are questioning the well-being of oneself and focusing on the possible causes and consequences of one's depressive symptoms (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991). For example, some ruminative thoughts include \\"why am I such a loser\\", \\"I'm in such a bad mood\\" or \\"I just don't feel like doing anything\\". Another difference emerged in the content of rumination concerns the time period of ruminative thinking, with several theories supposing that rumination can vacillate between past, current, and future focus, and others assuming that ruminative content is focused on the past or present. It is consistently reported that rumination, in comparison to worry, contains past-related thoughts. However, a more recent study found that time orientation changes over the course of rumination, such that individuals begin with a past focus, but increase in present and future related thoughts over the course of ruminating. Thus, rumination may be more complicated than previously thought, and not necessarily wholly past focused. Three forms of rumination have been proposed: * State rumination, which involves dwelling on the consequences and feelings associated with the failure. State rumination is more common in people who are pessimistic, neurotic, and who have negative attributional styles. * Action rumination, which consists of task-oriented thought processes focused on goal-achievement and correction of mistakes. * Task-irrelevant rumination, which utilizes events or people unassociated with the blocked goal to distract a person from the failure.  Measurement  The tendency to ruminate can be assessed with the Ruminative Responses Scale of the Response Styles Questionnaire. On this measure, people are asked to indicate how often they engage in 22 ruminative thoughts or behaviors when they feel sad or blue.  Sex differences  According to Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, women tend to ruminate when they are depressed, whereas men tend to distract themselves. This difference in response style was proposed to explain the higher rates of depression in women compared to men. Researchers have confirmed the greater likelihood of rumination in women, though the prediction that men are more likely to distract themselves has not been consistently supported.  Healthy self-disclosure  Although rumination is generally unhealthy and associated with depression, thinking and talking about one's feelings can be beneficial under the right conditions. According to Pennebaker, healthy self-disclosure can reduce distress and rumination when it leads to greater insight and understanding about the source of one's problems. Thus, when people share their feelings with others in the context of supportive relationships, they are likely to experience growth. In contrast, when people repetitively ruminate and dwell on the same problem without making progress, they are likely to experience depression. Co-rumination is a process defined as \\"excessively discussing personal problems within a dyadic relationship\\" (Rose, 2002), a construct that is relatively understudied in both its negative and positive trade-offs.  Relationship to other related constructs  Rumination has been confounded with other similar constructs that may overlap with it. Worry and negative automatic thoughts are two of them.  Worry  Rumination appears closely related to worry. Worry has been identified as \\"a chain of thoughts and images, negatively affect-laden and relatively uncontrollable; it represents an attempt to engage in mental problem solving on an issue whose outcome is uncertain, but contains the possibility of one or more negative outcomes.\\" (Borkovec) Rumination has also been compared to worry, and in some models, is considered a type of worry (S-REF). Many researchers have noted the high comorbidity of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression; over 60% of clients who present with symptoms of GAD also qualify for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. This significant concurrence has led to an increasing literature on the overlap between rumination, which is often studied in the context of depression, and worry, which is often studied in the context of GAD. Measures of rumination and worry have also demonstrated high correlations, above and beyond that of symptom measures of anxiety and depression (r=.66; Beck & Perkins, 2001). Rumination and worry overlap in their relationships to anxiety and depression, although some studies do indicate specificity of rumination to depression and worry to anxiety. Rumination has been found to predict changes in both depression and anxiety symptoms and individuals with major depression have been reported to engage in levels of worry similar to individuals with GAD. As a whole, these studies suggest that rumination and worry are related not only to each other, but also each is related to symptoms of both depression and anxiety. Other studies have demonstrated that the content of worry and rumination are distinct; worry thoughts are often focused on problem-solving and have a future orientation, whereas ruminative thoughts concern themes of loss and are more focused on the past. Rumination, as compared to worry, has also been associated with less effort and less confidence in problem solving (Papageorgiou & Wells, 2004). It has also been suggested that rumination and worry serve different purposes, namely that rumination is associated with greater belief in the personal relevance of a situation and a larger need to understand it, whereas worry is associated with a desire to avoid worry thoughts (Watkins 2004b). Worry has also been hypothesized to contain more imagery than rumination; however, support for this has been mixed. Overall, these studies suggest that worry and rumination are related constructs that both lead to depression and anxiety. It is likely that rumination and worry, as with rumination and reflection, are related types of repetitive negative thinking that may be better captured as subtypes of some larger construct, such as avoidant coping strategies.  Negative automatic thoughts  Rumination has been compared to negative automatic thoughts, defined as repetitive thoughts that contain themes of personal loss or failure. Nolen- Hoeksema (2004) contends that rumination (as defined in RST) is distinct from negative automatic thoughts in that while negative automatic thoughts are relatively shorthand appraisals of loss and depression in depression, rumination consists of longer chains of repetitive, recyclic, negative and self-focused thinking that may occur as a response to initial negative thoughts. Nolen also suggests that rumination may, in addition to analysis of symptoms, causes, and consequences, contain negative themes like those in automatic thoughts. Similarly, Papageorgiou and Wells (2004) have provided supports to this conclusion when they found that rumination can predict depression even when negative cognitions are controlled, suggesting that these constructs do not wholly overlap and have different predictive value. Despite Nolen-Hoeksema's (2004) argument that rumination and negative automatic thoughts are distinct phenomena, the Response Style Questionnaire has been criticized for its conceptual overlap with negative automatic thoughts.

In the background is the Helsinki city hall. The Cholera basin (, ) is the established name for the western harbour basin in front of the Market Square in Helsinki, Finland.  History  The harbour basins were built in the early 19th century. At that time, the Market Square area consisted of the muddy Kaupunginlahti bay. Its shores had many shore huts and small piers. Where the edge of the Market Square is now was the Etel√§inen Rantakatu street. As the city developed, the harbour needed a continuous pier. The shore was low, and this allowed the shoreline to be moved outwards by filling the shore. The work took years. For small steam ships, rowing and sailing ships, three basins were built. At the northwestern corner was built the so-called Fish basin (Kala-allas). In the city documents, the name of the basin was Stadfiskarens b√•thamn, meaning city fishers' boat harbour, Fiskarhamnen meaning fishers' harbour. In 1893, a shipsman from Nagu who had come to the herring market died of cholera on his ship. Later it was found out that the excrement and vomit of the sick man had been dumped into the harbour basin. As a safety precaution, the herring ships were towed away from the harbour, and guards were briefly posted at the shore, because it was feared that the citizens might start to use the contaminated water. After the incident, the colloquial name of the basin was established as Kolerabass√§ngen - the Cholera basin. In the 19th century, the water in the Fisher's harbour and in the entire Etel√§satama harbour was still contaminated by sewers. Rats infested the harbour. On the northern shore of Katajanokka, there was a sewage pier, also bringing dirt and stench. The products of outdoor toilets were loaded onto barges there, where they were taken to the countryside to be used as manure. There were rumours in the city that in the night, the barges silently dump their cargo straight into the water. This was even claimed to be a stinking revolt against Governor General Nikolai Bobrikov's politics.  Trivia  Saint Jacob is connected with a tradition of carrying a stone on the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela and then throwing it away to symbolize absolution - this associates Jacob with stone- casting.https://seura.fi/asiat/ajankohtaista/jaakon-paiva-salaisuudet-mista- varastettu-kolera-altaaseen-heitettava-kylma-kivi/ Finnish tradition holds that on the name day of Jaakko (Jacob), July 25, \\"Jaakko throws a cold stone into the water\\".

The micronation is promoted by the Israel Ministry of Tourism even though its legal status remains ambiguous. History The micronation is located near the ruins of Achziv, an ancient settlement on the Mediterranean coast in the Western Galilee, about 5 kilometers north of Nahariya. A national park, field school, and the ruins of the Palestinian village of Az-Zeeb, which was captured by the Carmeli Brigade during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, are located nearby. Eli Avivi The current site of Akhzivland is situated near the ancient port city of Achziv. Based on archeological findings and the numerous burial sites located in the region, it is thought that Achziv was already an important commercial center during the Iron Age. In the Book of Joshua, Achziv is mentioned as one of the nine cities of the Kingdom of Judah. A thriving city was also located on the site during the time of the Mishnah. During the Crusader period, the city was given as a gift to a knight. During the Mamluk period, it was conquered by the Mamluk general Baibars, who established a fishing village at the site called Az-Zeeb. Its residents fled Az-Zeeb during Operation Ben-Ami in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. The Akhzivland Museum in 2015 In 1952, Iranian-born sailor and Palmach veteran Eli Avivi moved into buildings in the villages. According to former residents of Az Zeeb, Avivi was hired by a family of fishermen, and later moved into the family's house in 1955. In 1961, the Israeli government granted the French resort company Club Med a fifty-year lease over part of the area's coastline. In 1970, the Israeli government sent bulldozers to demolish the home in which Avivi had been living. In protest, Eli founded Akhzivland in 1971, setting up a hostel and a museum inside the former home of the mukhtar of Az-Zeeb. The micronation became a tourist site‚Äîdescribed by Haaretz as a \\"hippy micro state\\"‚Äîattracting artists, models, writers, politicians, and countercultural figures, including Shimon Peres, Bar Refaeli, Sophia Loren, and Paul Newman. The micronation elected Avivi to be President (according to the constitution \\"The president is democratically elected by his own vote\\"), established a flag and national anthem, and even issued passports. For a certain time, visitors‚Äô passports received a special stamp. Following the founding of Akhzivland, Avivi was arrested and detained, but was released 10 days later after a judge ruled that the charge of \\"Creation of a Country Without Permission\\" did not exist. After Avivi sued the Israeli government, a court ruled to lease the area to Avivi for 99 years, but did not rule on the legal status of the state. In 1971, six Palestinian gunmen infiltrated Israel by sea from Lebanon, landing on the beach of Achziv. One of the gunmen entered the house but was stopped at gunpoint by Avivi's wife, Rina, dropping his weapon and a bag of grenades. Two more gunmen were caught by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) at the boat, while the other three were captured inland. Akhzivland now contains a guest house, beachfront campground, and a museum of local findings from the sea and seashore. Eli Avivi died of pneumonia on May 16, 2018. Flag The flag of Akhzivland has two white images with blue lines. One of them depicts a house which is the main building in Akhzivland. The other image depicts a mermaid resembling the one in the flag of Eemsmond, a Dutch municipality.

The company was founded in 2007 by Warner Independent Pictures and Miramax president Mark Gill and former Yari Film Group COO and Miramax veteran Neil Sacker. TFD received initial funding in the form of a $200 million capitalization from G.E. Capital, which was to allow them to produce 6 films per year budgeted between $10 and $45 million. The company's intention was to make star-driven, commercial pictures at the high end of every genre aimed at worldwide audiences. Allen & Company also played a major role in financing TFD. In July 2008, The Film Department and Downtown Music Publishing announced the formation of a new music film company and partnership, TFD Music. Through the partnership, Downtown Publishing served as the exclusive, worldwide administrator for the TDF Music copyrights and master recordings, and offered music supervision and soundtrack consulting services for motion pictures. TFD's first release, ‚ÄúLaw Abiding Citizen,‚Äù generated $73 million in domestic ticket sales.

British West Florida comprised parts of the modern U.S. states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Effective British control ended in 1781 when Spain captured Pensacola. The territory subsequently became a colony of Spain, parts of which were gradually annexed piecemeal by the United States beginning in 1810. Creation In 1762, during the Seven Years' War, a British expedition attacked and occupied Havana, the capital of Cuba. To secure the return of this valuable city, Spain agreed to cede its territory of La Florida to the victorious Great Britain under the 1763 Treaty of Paris. France ceded a large segment of New France to Great Britain, including its territory east of the Mississippi River except for the city of New Orleans. The British divided this southern region of the North American continent into two separate colonies: East Florida, with its capital in St. Augustine and West Florida, with Pensacola as its capital. Many of the Spanish inhabitants of Florida were evacuated to Cuba, and new British settlers arrived including some from the thirteen colonies. By separate treaty France ceded its lands west of the Mississippi to Spain, which formed Spanish Louisiana with the capital at New Orleans. British era Britain formed West Florida from part of Spanish Florida, as well as territory received from French Louisiana. In 1763 British troops arrived and took possession of Pensacola. George Johnstone was appointed as the first British Governor, and in 1764 a colonial assembly was established. The structure of the colony was modeled after the existing British colonies in America, as opposed to Quebec, which was based on a different structure. In contrast to East Florida, where there was little development and population growth, West Florida began to boom in the years following the British takeover, and thousands of new arrivals came to take advantage of the favorable conditions there. West Florida was invited to send delegates to the First Continental Congress which was convened to present colonial grievances against the British Parliament to George III, but along with several other colonies, including East Florida, they declined the invitation. Once the American War of Independence had broken out, the colonists remained overwhelmingly loyal to the Crown. In 1778 the Willing Expedition proceeded with a small force down the Mississippi, ransacking estates and plantations, until they were eventually defeated by a local militia. In the wake of this, the area received a small number of British reinforcements. Spanish conquest Spanish troops storming Pensacola in 1781 Following an agreement signed at Aranjuez, Spain entered the American Revolutionary War on the side of France but not the Thirteen Colonies. Spanish troops under Bernardo de G√°lvez advanced and seized Baton Rouge and Mobile. In 1781 Spain captured Pensacola and its garrison. As part of the 1783 Peace of Paris, Great Britain ceded the territories of West Florida and East Florida back to Spain. When Spain acquired West Florida in 1783, the eastern British boundary was the Apalachicola River, but Spain in 1785 moved it eastward to the Suwannee River. Wright also notes, \\"It was some time after 1785 before it was clearly established that Suwannee was the new eastern boundary of the province of Apalachee.\\" The purpose was to transfer San Marcos and the district of Apalachee from East Florida to West Florida.

It was featured in the 1955 film Pete Kelly's Blues, where it was sung by Peggy Lee. The song has been used to teach children names of colours. Despite the name of the song, two of the seven colours mentioned (\\"red and yellow and pink and green, purple and orange and blue\\") ‚Äì pink and purple ‚Äì are not actually a colour of the rainbow (i.e. they are not spectral colors; pink is a variation of shade, and purple is the human brain's interpretation of mixed red/blue [see line of purples]).

David and Marianne Dalmour used the song as first track of their LP \\"Introducing David and Marianne Dalmour.‚Äù The British pop singer Cilla Black recorded the song for her 1966 studio album Cilla Sings a Rainbow; the album title and cover sleeve were both inspired by the song. Black's second album was a commercial success, charting at #4 on the UK Album Chart. Due to popular demand, Black regularly performed the song in her live concert tours of the 1960s and 1970s.

The humorous and satirical full- length ballet in three acts and seven scenes was choreographed by Fyodor Lopukhov and premiered on 8 April 1931 at the State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet in Leningrad. It was not performed again until 2005, when a two-act choreography by Alexei Ratmansky was performed at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. Plot The ballet is an ironic tale of slovenly work in a Soviet factory. The lazy Lyonka hates work and together with a local priest and anti- Soviet plotter he plans to sabotage the machinery by putting a bolt in it. Their plan is foiled by a group of Young Communists.

Along with his other ballets The Limpid Stream and The Golden Age, the work was banned by the authorities after Shostakovich's first denunciation in 1936.

It can be defined as locus of the point of intersection of two lines, each rotating at a uniform rate about separate points, so that the ratio of the rates of rotation is 2:3 and the lines initially coincide with the line between the two points. Thus, it is an example of a sectrix of Maclaurin. Equations If the first line is rotating about the origin, forming angle \\\\theta with the x-axis, and the second line is rotating about the point (a, 0) with angle {3 \\\\theta \\\\over 2}, then the angle between them is {\\\\theta \\\\over 2}, and the Law of Sines can be used to determine the distance from the point of intersection to the origin as :r=a \\\\frac {\\\\sin \\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\theta}{\\\\sin \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\theta} = a(3\\\\cos^2 \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\theta - \\\\sin^2 \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\theta) = a(1+2\\\\cos\\\\theta). This is the equation with polar coordinates, showing that the curve is a Lima√ßon. The curve crosses itself at the origin, the rightmost point of the outer loop is at (3a, 0) and the tip of the inner loop is at (a, 0). If the curve is shifted so that the origin is at the tip of the inner loop then the equation becomes :r = 2a\\\\cos{\\\\theta \\\\over 3} so it is also in the rose family of curves. The trisection property second method: \\\\beta=\\\\tfrac{1}{3}\\\\alpha There are several ways to use the curve to trisect an angle. Let \\\\varphi be the angle to be trisected. First, draw a ray from the tip of the small loop at (a, 0) with angle \\\\varphi with the x-axis. Let P be the point where the ray intersects the curve, assumed to be on the outer loop if \\\\varphi is small. Draw another ray from the origin to P. Then the angle between the two rays at P trisects \\\\varphi. This follows easily from the construction of the curve given above. For the second method, draw a circle of radius a and center at the origin. Draw a ray from the origin with angle \\\\varphi with the x-axis. Let C be the point where this ray intersects the circle and draw the line from C to (a, 0). Let P' be the point where this line intersects the curve, assumed to be on the inner loop if \\\\varphi is small. The line from the origin to P' has angle {\\\\varphi \\\\over 3} with the x-axis. By rotating the curve, the second form of the equation becomes :r=a\\\\sin{\\\\theta \\\\over 3}. So if a right triangle is constructed with side r and hypotenuse a then the angle between them will be {\\\\theta \\\\over 3}. It is straightforward to generate a third method from this.

Life  Ioan Lemeni was born on April 22, 1780 in Dezm√©r, Transylvania, Royal Hungary. He was ordained a priest on Oct 1, 1805. After two years of didactic career at Blaj, as Professor of Philosophy and Church History, in 1807 he was appointed parish and protopop of Cluj. He was archpriest of Cluj and, after 1829, secretary of the bishop of FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü-Alba Iulia Ioan Bob to who he succeeded on 23 Aug 1832. His appointment to the Diocese of FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü, i.e. Primate of the Church, was confirmed by Pope Gregory XVI on 16 Apr 1833, so becoming the Primate of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church. Because he was not yet a bishop, he was consecrated a Bishop on Jun 6, 1833 by Samuil Vulcan, bishop of the Diocese of Oradea Mare. The press of that period attests that he was able to preach even four times a day. Usually, his sermons were elaborated in Hungarian, Ioan Lemeni being seriously criticized by a part of Romanian historians who ignored the specific historical context from that time. In 1845 after a long and bitter dispute, Ioan Lemeni dismissed Simion BƒÉrnu»õiu from Blaj. Together with the Orthodox Bishop Andrei ≈ûaguna he had a role in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 supporting the union of Transylvania with Hungary and so opposing the Austrian government. For this reason, as required by the Austrian government, he had to resign in March 1850. After his resignation, he went to Vienna, where he died on March 29, 1861.

As a businessman he would loan money to other businessmen. In one such loan he had to foreclose for delinquent payments on a sawmill operation in Michigan. He ultimately obtained the sawmill in the village of Pere Marquette. Ludington platted the land there and formed a town with a lumber company operation. He later sold his interest to the lumber company for a large sum of money and became very wealthy. The town later changed its name and became Ludington, Michigan, although he never lived there.  Biography James was born in Carmel, New York on April 18, 1827. In 1843, the Ludington family moved from New York to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, when James was 16. James and his father, Lewis Ludington, founded Columbus, Wisconsin in 1845. In 1849, Utah Territorial Governor, Brigham Young, wrote to Ludington, soliciting his help in the construction of a paper mill in the Salt Lake Valley. Ludington planned to travel west to supervise the mill's construction, but the deal was never completed.Ludington to Young, 1850 Jan 7, Feb 22, Mar 20. Brigham Young Papers. Church History Library. Salt Lake City, Utah. On October 11, 1854, Ludington loaned funds to George W. Ford for a sawmill operation in what was then known as the village of Pere Marquette in the northwestern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. When Ford defaulted on the loan and became insolvent in 1859, Ludington took over the operations of this sawmill. In 1854, Ludington filed for the purchase of unsold school land from the state of Wisconsin that was believed to contain some . The sale was challenged and ultimately cancelled when the parcel was identified as containing over . The purchase was re-filed after a further effort to specify which parcels were included. In 1855, the arrangements behind Ludington's purchase were investigated by James Halpin and Dr. Hunt, as to the amount of funds and whether they were properly appropriated. In 1856, Ludington was implicated in a bribery and fraud scheme surrounding the sale. He was cleared of wrongdoing after a lengthy legislative investigation and public testimony. Ludington platted 360 acres of the land around Pere Marquette in 1867 and sold lots to individuals, developing the town. In the same year, he built a large commercial building, called \\"The Big Store\\" that sold a variety of goods. Also at that time Ludington founded the first newspaper in the village, the Mason County Record. The sawmill that Ludington acquired developed into an independent entity, called the Pere Marquette Lumber Company, which operated and managed the sawmill and The Big Store. On July 24, 1869, Ludington sold his interests to the company for half a million dollars, making him a very wealthy person. Ludington used a portion of this money to develop the village. On March 22, 1873, the city of Ludington was chartered. Ludington lived in New York state as a boy and in Wisconsin as an adult, but never lived in Ludington, Michigan, the town that bears his name. The streets of Ludington Avenue and James Street are named after him. The streets Lewis, William, Robert, Charles, Harrison, Emily, Lavina, and Delia are named after his family members. Ludington died on April 1, 1891, in his residence at Plankinton House Hotel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He is buried at Carmel where he was born. Positions At one time or another, Ludington held the following positions: *Treasurer of La Crosse Railroad (La Crosse, Wisconsin) *President of Bank of the West (Madison, Wisconsin) *Vice-President of the Juneau Bank (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) *Alderman in the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin Legacy Streets in Ludington, Michigan were named for his family members. When memories of the town's founder, James Ludington, faded, Charles Street was renamed for William Rath.

Biography Morris founded the successful specialist wine importers Morris & Verdin in 1981. He studied to become a Master of Wine concurrently with Jancis Robinson, MW, and with his sister Arabella Woodrow, MW, Morris achieving the accreditation in 1985 and Woodrow in 1986. Morris and Woodrow are the only pair of siblings to be Masters of Wine.Woodrow, Arabella, Master of Wine, The Institute of Masters of Wine After Berry Bros. & Rudd acquired Morris & Verdin in 2003, Morris was appointed BBR buying director.

Berry Bros launches publishing division Having retired from commerce Jasper Morris has embarked on a new career as Burgundy expert and critic, culminating in the launch of the website Jasper Morris Inside Burgundy in September 2018. Jasper Morris Inside Burgundy, InsideBurgundy.com (25 May 2020). About JMIB  Learn a little more about Jasper Morris Inside Burgundy. Jasper Morris Inside Burgundy - The Website Jasper Morris Inside Burgundy Website Logo, www.insideburgundy.com. Founded September 2018. Jasper Morris Inside Burgundy is the perfect website for the Burgundy lover. The website is dedicated to everything about the wines of Burgundy. It complements Jasper Morris‚Äôs book, Inside Burgundy, which is a mine of information about the region, the vineyards and the producers. The website offers up to the minute insights into what is happening in Burgundy today, and extensive reviews of wines past and present. Jasper Morris's 100 Point and 5 Star Scales Jasper Morris Inside Burgundy uses a combination of the following two scales to help distinguish a truly successful wine. The aim is to provide information and to give guidance on which wines are worth buying. For this Jasper Morris has designed a double-headed scoring system: Absolute Scoring on the 100 Point Scale and Comparative Grading out of 5 stars.Jasper Morris Inside Burgundy, InsideBurgundy.com (27 May 2020). The 100 Point Scale  The Five Star Scale =The 100 Point Scale= Most international publications have taken to this scale. It is much more useful in Bordeaux or for other regions where a producer offers a single wine, but less well in Burgundy or wherever a producer has a wide range of wines which tend broadly to follow a hierarchical pattern ‚Äì in our case generic Bourgogne, village, lieu-dit, premier cru, grand cru. There will be occasions when a Bourgogne Rouge stands out as a more successful wine than the same producer‚Äôs village wine but this doesn‚Äôt happen often. So we need some way to flag up wines which are really fine examples of their category. So step forward‚Ä¶ The Five Star Scale =The 5 Star Scale= 5 Stars - An outstanding wine in its category. This accolade will be given very rarely, certainly to less than 10% of wines tasted across the year. A generic Bourgogne might deserve this reward if it merits 89 or 90 points whereas a Puligny-Montrachet Les Pucelles would need 96 for the same result. 4 Stars - An excellent wine in its category and given the ‚Äòunicorn‚Äô status of the fifth star, any producer receiving 4 stars for a wine should be extremely proud of their achievement. 3 Stars - A wine that meets or exceeds expectations: the producer has done very well in this vintage. These wines are recommended for purchase if they fall within your style and pricing brackets. 2 Stars - Two stars may seem ungenerous, but nonetheless this wine fulfils what the appellation or vineyard should be able to offer. While the little bit extra may not be readily evident, this is still a well-made wine. 1 Star - A little bit disappointing compared to expectations. We hope that there will not be too many wines in this category, given that most wines tasted come from producers pre-selected for their quality. Some wines may not gain a star of any sort though these will normally be suffering from a specific fault. Jasper Morris's Tasting Reports The core activity of the Jasper Morris Inside Burgundy website is the provision of Tasting Reports. Each one of these provides an interesting narrative in its own right, while also populating the database which is growing all the time, and from which at any time you can check up on the current rating of any wine of interest. The Tasting Reports themselves come in various guises and this is fully explained below:Jasper Morris Inside Burgundy, InsideBurgundy.com (27 May 2020). JMIB tasting reports  JMIB Tasting NotesJasper Morris Inside Burgundy, InsideBurgundy.com (27 May 2020). An Introduction to Tasting Reports =En Primeur Barrel Tastings= These are conducted at the domaines between September and December in the year following the vintage. The wines may still be in barrel, or tank, or recently bottled and will not be tasted blind. A range of scores will be given if the wine has not yet been assembled for bottling, or a single score if the wine has been bottled. The complete report with notes on the growing seasons and comments on how each appellation has performed will be released on 31 December. Further tasting notes may be added during the following six months. =The Burgfest Tastings= The Burgfest Tastings of the principal 1ers and Grands Crus take place three years after the vintage, with the whites tasted in May and the reds in September. The wines are sourced from the producers and tasted blind against their immediate peers. The wines are decanted into neutral carafes and served blind in short flights of single or neighbouring vineyards. =The 10 Year On & 20 Year on Tastings= 10 Year On and 20 Year On Tastings are held (together) in June of the appropriate year. The wines are sourced from the producers and are not served blind, so examples of the same wines in the market place may not have the same provenance. =Producer Verticals= Producer Verticals may be instigated by the producers themselves or be the result of tastings and dinners assembled by reliable collectors or our own efforts. The background to the tasting will be explained in each case in the introductory remarks. These wines are not usually tasted blind. =Vineyard Focus= Vineyard Focus tastings will cover a specific vineyard and multiple producers, either in a vertical or a horizontal format, teasing out the character of the vineyard in question while establishing who are the key performers.

The epicenter of the magnitude 5.5 earthquake was in Chino Hills, c. east-southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Though no lives were lost, eight people were injured, and it caused considerable damage in numerous structures throughout the area and caused some amusement park facilities to shut down their rides. The earthquake led to increased discussion regarding the possibility of a stronger earthquake in the future. Earthquake The Chino Hills earthquake was caused by oblique-slip faulting, with components of both thrust and sinistral strike-slip displacement. Preliminary reports cited the Whittier fault as the active cause, but the quake was later determined to have been generated by the \\"Yorba Linda trend,\\" as identified by Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson. Its epicenter was within of Chino Hills and its hypocenter was c. deep. Initial estimations of the moderate main shock reported it as magnitude 5.8, but this was later revised to magnitude 5.4 and in later months to a 5.5. The main shock was reportedly felt as far south as San Diego, and Tijuana, Mexico, and as far east as Las Vegas, Nevada. It was the strongest earthquake to occur in the greater Los Angeles area since the 1994 Northridge earthquake. As reported by The Orange County Register, three microearthquakes, all less than magnitude 3.0, occurred in Anaheim Hills, southwest of Chino Hills, two months before the Chino Hills earthquake. There was an unusually low amount of seismic activity in Southern California in the week prior to the quake. Between July 20 and July 26, 2008, there were no earthquakes in Southern California exceeding magnitude 3.0, thus there was speculation that the wane in seismic activity was a precursor to a possible larger event. Impact The earthquake knocked down merchandise inside buildings such as this Yorba Linda grocery store. The Chino Hills earthquake caused no deaths or significant damage due to the physical location of its epicenter. Most of the infrastructure in the Chino Hills area is relatively new and well suited to withstand a large quake. Unlike previous earthquakes in the region‚Äîsuch as the 1994 Northridge earthquake and the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, which caused serious structural damage and fatalities‚Äîthis quake caused only minor damage. However, the high volume of telephone use following the shock overloaded provider capacity and disrupted service into the afternoon. Amusement rides at Disneyland, Six Flags Magic Mountain, Universal Studios Hollywood and Knott's Berry Farm were evacuated and temporarily shut down. California State University, Fullerton suffered some damage in its older, inadequately engineered buildings. In Orange, the Chapman University School of Law was evacuated after a water pipe was ruptured. Pipes on a Macy's department store in Westfield Topanga ruptured during the tremor flooding the store which closed for a couple of days in order to be repaired. A light fixture damaged by the shock started a small fire in the Westfield MainPlace Mall in Santa Ana; since the fire was in an empty movie theater, nobody was harmed. Earthquake damage at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. A gap was reported on California State Route 91 near Anaheim Hills, c. southwest of the epicenter, but the California Department of Transportation concluded that the gap did not pose a danger. A minor landslide near the freeway caused some traffic congestion, but structural damage was reported. Caltrans replaced an expansion joint on an Interstate 5 truck overpass at the El Toro Y Interchange. The roof of Placentia's public library nearly collapsed; afterwards, the building was closed for repairs. Electrical outages were reported in Chino, Chino Hills, Diamond Bar and Pomona. Over 2,000 people lost power after a fire broke out at a La Habra power station, but electricity was restored that afternoon. Los Angeles International Airport reported a ground radar system outage along with a broken water heater, causing flooding in the checked luggage preparation area of Terminal 7. Minor injuries from falling ceiling tiles were reported at a medical clinic in Brea. Aftershocks Damage in a shopping center. Approximately 100 minor aftershocks and one presumed foreshock were reported within two days after the earthquake, See also: 27 of which occurred within an hour after the earthquake. Four aftershocks of at least 3.0 in magnitude were reported‚Äîthe first, nine minutes following the initial earthquake, was the largest at magnitude 3.8; and two others, occurring over two hours later, were recorded at magnitude 3.6. Twenty-eight aftershocks of at least 2.0 were reported. Response There was speculation that the Chino Hills earthquake may have been a foreshock to a larger earthquake. See also: The Southern California Seismic Network's Aftershock Probability Report, produced minutes after the event, stated that \\"Most likely, the recent mainshock will be the largest in the sequence. However, there is a small chance, c. 5‚Äì10%, of an earthquake equal to or larger than this mainshock in the next 7 days.\\" Geologists at the United States Geological Survey and Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast suggest that an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.7 or larger will almost definitely occur somewhere in the state within the next 30 years. See also: California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said: \\"This earthquake reminds us to be prepared. [...] We were very fortunate that there were no serious injuries or property damage.\\" Additionally, registration for the Great Southern California ShakeOut, a regional earthquake drill scheduled to occur on Nov. 13, 2008, increased significantly in the aftermath of the earthquake.

He was a Roman Catholic from one of America's most distinguished Roman Catholic families. His paternal grandmother was Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton, the first American citizen to be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. Life He was educated at St. John's College, Fordham, at Mt. St. Mary's, Emmittsburg, Md., and at the University of Bonn. He traveled extensively abroad before entering a law office in New York. Soon after his admission to the bar he answered Lincoln's first call for troops in 1861. Disabled for a time by two wounds received in the Battle of Antietam, where he fought as captain of the Forty- first New York Volunteers, French's Division, Sumner's Corps, he returned to his father's home, Cragdon, Westchester County, New York, but went back to the front to be captain of the 16th Artillery in Grant's campaign against Richmond. His alma mater, Mt. St. Mary's, conferred on him the degree of LL.D. in 1890. Works After the war he devoted himself chiefly to literature, publishing two historical novels, \\"Romance of the Charter Oak\\" (1870) and \\"Pride of Lexington\\" (1871); \\"The Pioneer\\", a poem (1874); \\"Rachel's Fate\\" (1882); \\"The Shamrock Gone West\\", and \\"Moire\\" (1884). About 1886 he went to Europe for serious study in paleontology, psychology, etc., and thereafter usually spent the greater part of each year in France in such pursuits. His forte was presenting scientific matters in attractive English. He issued a brief work, \\"A Glimpse of Organic Life, Past and Present\\" (1897). He was a frequent contributor of scientific articles to the \\"Catholic World\\". \\"The Building of the Mountain\\", a novel, was in the press at the time of his death. Family His father was William Seton II, captain in the U. S. Navy, son of Elizabeth Ann Seton; his mother was Emily Prime. Burke's Peerage (1900) recognized him as the head of the Seton family of Parbroath, senior cadets of the earls of Winton in Scotland. He outlived by ten years his wife Sarah Redwood Parrish, a Philadelphian Catholic convert from the Society of Friends. He is buried with the Setons at Mt. St. Mary's, Emmitsburg, Maryland.

Old Drizzle files are distributed under version 2 and 3 of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with portions, including the protocol drivers and replication messaging under the BSD license. Early work on the fork was done mid-2008 by Brian Aker.Drizzle History Ongoing development was handled by a team of contributors that included staff members from Canonical Ltd., Google, Six Apart, Sun Microsystems, Rackspace, Data Differential, Blue Gecko, Intel, Percona, Hewlett-Packard, Red Hat, and others.List of Drizzle Contributors Drizzle source code, along with instructions on compiling it, are available via the project's Launchpad website.Drizzle.org In October 2010, Drizzle had 13,478 total contributions, 96 total contributors, and 37 active contributors.How Many Contributors does Drizzle Have? It was also announced that Drizzle had entered Beta,.Drizzle7 Beta Released The first GA version was released in March 2011. Drizzle has actively participated in the Google Summer of Code Project since 2010.  Uses  Drizzle is targeted at the web-infrastructure and cloud computing markets. The developers of the product describe it as a \\"smaller, slimmer and (hopefully) faster version of MySQL\\".Monty-says.blogspot.com  Platforms and interfaces  Drizzle is written in the C++ programming language, and stores its string data in the UTF-8 format. It is being developed for modern Unix- like operating systems, including Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Solaris ‚Äì in general, any OS that conforms to POSIX and has a working implementation of the GNU Autotools. Microsoft Windows is not supported at this time, mainly for lack of Autotools support, but there has been discussion of how to accomplish this in a sensible manner.  Features  Drizzle is a re-designed version of the MySQL v6.0 codebase and is designed around a central concept of having a microkernel architecture. Features such as the query cache and authentication system are now plugins to the database, which follow the general theme of \\"pluggable storage engines\\" that were introduced in MySQL 5.1. It supports PAM, LDAP, and HTTP AUTH for authentication via plugins it ships. Via its plugin system it currently supports logging to files, syslog, and remote services such as RabbitMQ and Gearman. Drizzle is an ACID-compliant relational database that supports transactions via an MVCC design.Drizzle Documentation  Microkernel  Plugin points have been added to support replication, storage engines, query rewrite, table functions, user-defined functions, protocol adapters, and multiple query caches.  Indexes  Like MySQL, Drizzle supports concurrent multiple engines. Via this, Drizzle includes built-in support for B+ tree and hash indexes. Drizzle's query planner is capable of using multiple indexes, from multiple engines to satisfy complex queries, using temporary in-memory bitmap index operations.  Triggers  Database triggers in Drizzle are supported for DML, DDL, and a number of additional event-based operations in the server. The PrimeBase BLOB streaming system, which allows Drizzle to stream binary large objects (BLOBs) via HTTP, makes use of this system. All triggers for Drizzle currently must be written in C++.  Query rewrite  Any query can be matched and rewritten dynamically that is sent to the server. This action is done before parsing occurs.  Data types  A wide variety of native data types are supported, including: * Variable-length arrays (including text and composite types) up to 4 GB in total storage size * Arbitrary precision numerics * An enumerated type (enum) that supports current 10,000 types  Dynamic SQL  Through support of the EXECUTE command Drizzle can operate dynamic multi-statement SQL. Via the keyword CONCURRENT it can operate these statements in parallel.  Replication  Replication in Drizzle is done by generating \\"messages\\" using the Google Protocol Buffers library. These messages are then stored and executed on remote servers.

The battle, which took place between May 21-26, 1921, was fought at the Annaberg (Polish: G√≥ra ≈öw. Anny), a strategic hill near the village of Annaberg O.S. (G√≥ra ≈öwiƒôtej Anny), located southeast of Oppeln (Opole) in Upper Silesia, Weimar Germany. After the hill had been captured by irregular Polish-Silesian units in the Third Silesian Uprising, German Freikorps pushed the Polish forces back. The final border was determined by political and diplomatic efforts. Prelude By the Treaty of Versailles, the German Reichswehr was limited to a strength of 100,000. Several independent paramilitary Freikorps units were formed from the remnants of the German Imperial Army. The German Freikorps units often did not obey orders from the official government, but the German government assisted in transportation and supplies.Citino, p. 245 Freikorps units fought against the communist groups in Germany and also against Polish insurgents in the East. While Germany had recognized the independent Polish state in the aftermath of Versailles, there were some disputed areas, some of which saw violent conflict. On April 30, 1921, Polish-Silesian officials led by Wojciech Korfanty, upon finding that Germany would be granted most of the plebiscite area in disputed Upper Silesia, decided to start the Third UprisingHistory of the Silesian Uprisings even though the government in Warsaw wanted to avoid hostilities at all cost. On May 2, acts of sabotage by the Polish Wawelberg Group units under Konrad Wawelberg severed all connections between Upper Silesia and Germany. On May 3, at 3 a.m., the Polish forces started an offensive and in the following days they pushed the small German forces westwards, reaching the line of the Oder River and capturing the 400 m strategic hill of Annaberg on May 4. It took around two weeks for the Germans to prepare the counteroffensive and to bring in volunteers from other German areas. The leaders settled for Generalleutnant Karl H√∂ferOberschlesien in der Aufstandszeit, 1918-1921\\\\. by A. D. Karl Hoefer, review by H. F. P. Percival, International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 1931-1939), Vol. 17, No. 6 (Nov. - Dec., 1938), pp. 853-854 (review consists of 2 pages) as commander. Generalleutnant Bernhard von H√ºlsen would lead the southern force at the Oder, and Oberstleutnant Gr√ºntzen would lead the northern force in the forests.Jurado, p. 31 The German units were strengthened by the arrival of the Freikorps Oberland unit from Bavaria. Its 1650 soldiers were experienced veterans of World War I, under Major Albert Ritter von Beckh. Among members of the FK Oberland were notable figures of the future Nazi Germany, including Sepp Dietrich (who distinguished himself during the battle), Rudolf H√∂ss, Edmund Heines, Beppo R√∂mer, and Peter von Heydebreck, leader of the WerewolvesJay W. Baird: Hitler's War Poets and later pronounced the \\"hero of Annaberg\\". Also, there were several student- volunteers from the Bavarian town of Erlangen. The German force also consisted of Silesian paramilitary battalions (Selbstschutzes Oberschlesien), consisting of recently-demobilized veterans and men too young to have fought in World War I. Although the Polish forces outnumbered the German troops in the region, the Germans had more experience than the Poles, many of whom were civilians. Battle The Annaberg hill with the monastery located on top, was strategically significant as from its peak the whole valley of the Oder/Odra could be dominated.Jurado, p. 32 The German-Upper Silesian commanders, Generals H√∂fer and H√ºlsen, decided to use three battalions of the Bavarian Oberland, which were transported to Krappitz (Krapkowice), on 19/20 May 1921. The German counterattack, which began at 2:30 a.m. on May 21,Citino, p. 247 was led by the Oberland Freikorps and Silesian Selbstschutz. H√ºlsen concentrated his six and a half undersized battalions, numbering roughly 900 men, into two columns to form left and right wings. The Germans launched their offensive, which started from a hill north of the Annaberg, against a regiment of Polish Silesian insurgents from Pless (Pszczyna), under Franciszek Rataj. The Germans lacked artillery, however, and fighting was fierce. H√ºlsen wrote, \\"We learned then how painful it could be to mount an assault on a fortified position without a single piece of artillery\\". Bavarian Oberlanders were able to defeat a Polish counterattack with grenades and bayonets and capture two cannons, which they used in an attack on the town Oleschka (Oleszka) west of the mountain. After seven hours of heavy combat, the Germans managed to force the Pless regiment to withdraw and then concentrated their attack on the neighboring regiment of Polish volunteers from Kattowitz (Katowice), under Walenty Fojkis, as well as Polish-Silesian battalions from Gro√ü Strehlitz (Strzelce Opolskie) and Tost (Toszek), known as Group Bogdan. Among Polish forces defending the mountain, there were also miners from the Ferdinand coal mine in Kattowitz as well as workers from the Kattowitz suburb of Bogutsch√ºtz (Bogucice). Altogether, Polish forces fighting in the area of the Annaberg formed Group East.Opole -- our city At 11:00 a.m. the Germans began a coordinated advance on the mountain: the Finsterlin Battalion from the northwest, the Assault Detachment Heintz from the southwest, the Oestricher Battalion from the east, and the Sebringhaus Battalion and the Eicke Company from the southeast. Under German pressure, the Poles, after heavy hand-to-hand combat, withdrew east. The subsequent Polish counterattack was repelled and the success of the Freikorps was widely reported in Germany, as it was regarded as the first German victory since November 1918. At the end of the day Polish defenders established defensive positions in Wielmierzowice, Krasowa, Zales ≈ölƒÖski and Popice. According to Hoefer's reports, in the subsequent fighting some of the German battalions were reduced to between 10 and 15% of their initial strength. By the afternoon of the 21st, Polish insurgents had pushed German forces back from Kalinow, Poznowic, Sprzecis and the railway station in Kamie≈Ñ. On the 22nd, Polish insurgents attacked and took back Raszowa and Daniec and in the Januszkowic region fought back a German attempt at crossing of the Oder. On May 23, the Poles, after regrouping and strengthening their forces with a battalion from Hindenburg O.S. (Zabrze) under Pawe≈Ç Cyms, initiated another strong attack, but it was repulsed by the German artillery, with great losses on both sides. Heavy fighting took place in neighboring villages, such as Leschnitz (Le≈õnica), Lichynia, Krasowa, Dolna, Olszowa and Klucz. Aftermath Map of the plebiscite areas. The government of each side could barely influence events as neither side had solid command structures and forces acted independently. On May 25, the Selbstschutz, under pressure from Berlin which threatened the Freikorps with serious penalties, decided to initiate peace talks. On the next day, the general command of Polish forces ordered their units to cease fighting. Some additional skirmishes took place around June 4 to June 6. In early July, Allied troops entered the area and separated the fighting sides; both Poles and Germans disengaged and retreated. For internal and external political reasons, the contributions of the German fighters was not officially recognized by the government, which supported bitter feelings against the Weimar Republic. The reputation of the \\"Annaberg heroes\\" helped them in later years, however. The disputed territory of Upper Silesia was subsequently divided between the two countries along voting lines (in the Upper Silesia plebiscite), with Poland receiving the eastern third of the area with the coal mines.\\"Mapy narodowo≈õciowe G√≥rnego ≈ölƒÖska od po≈Çowy XIX wieku do II Wojny ≈öwiatowej\\" Dorota Borowicz Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Wroc≈Çawskiego Wroc≈Çaw 2004 The new border followed roughly the line separating the sides at the close of hostilities (see Upper Silesia plebiscite).

McGarry (March 17, 1894 ‚Äì January 2, 1978) was a leading U.S. advocate in interracial justice and veteran social action leader. Most of her work occurred in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she was a central figure in improving race relations. She was also a journalist for the Philadelphia Tribune.  Early life  Anna McGarry was born on March 17, 1894, in Philadelphia to John and Sara McGinley. One of eight children, she attended parochial school in Philadelphia and two years of commercial high school. She worked as a bookkeeper with National Label Company early in her life. She married Francis McGarry in 1917, who left her a widow in 1921.  Social work  After her husband‚Äôs death, she began to take an active role in repairing inhospitable race relations in Philadelphia. As a young widow, she was aghast by the social inequalities inherent in her own neighborhood. She dedicated her life to social justice, spreading word of the mounting problems during the 1930s by teaching. Beginning with World War II, she helped found and began working with the Philadelphia Catholic Interracial Council,McGreevy, John T. (1998). Parish Boundaries: The Catholic Encounter with Race in the Twentieth-Century Urban North, p. 254. University of Chicago Press. becoming a staff member of the city‚Äôs Commission on Human Relations and fighting for fair employment practices for African-Americans in that capacity. She was a critical figure in ameliorating conflicts such as the racial violence set off when, during World War II, African-Americans obtained jobs in the city‚Äôs transit system, encountering hostile Irish transit union leaders.Clark, Dennis (1982). The Irish Relations: Trials of an Immigrant Tradition, p. 154. Associated University Presses, Inc. She hosted a weekly radio program on interracial justice and wrote a weekly column on it in an African-American Philadelphia newspaper. A leading figure in the National Catholic Conference for Interracial Justice and the National Catholic Social Action Conference, she went on to press for equal access to educational, housing, and public facilities for all, regardless of race. After her formal retirement in 1959, she remained active in those organizations, and she continued to tour and give public speeches in an attempt to raise awareness of the social and economic barriers faced by African-Americans. While the Catholic Church condoned her message of social justice, she was seen as too radical and thus often had to pursue her endeavors without its assistance.  Honors  McGarry received numerous accolades during her career, including honors from the New York Catholic Interracial Council, the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Immaculata College Alumnae Philadelphia chapter, the Afro-American Newspaper, and the Philadelphia Puerto Rican Community.

Co-founder Richard Riordan, who would later go on to serve as Mayor of Los Angeles, had been an attorney and had made substantial personal investments in technology companies. After joining the firm, Riordan focused primarily on venture capital investments in computer, medical, and semiconductor companies. Prior to co-founding Freeman Spogli, Bradford Freeman and Ronald P. Spogli had been Managing Directors in the Corporate Finance Department at Dean Witter Reynolds. The firm made its name in the 1980s through a series of leveraged buyout transactions. Throughout the 1980s, Riordan, Freeman & Spogli also executed leveraged buyouts of several supermarket retailers including Bayless Southwest (Phoenix), Boys Markets (Los Angeles), P&C; Foods (Syracuse, NY), Piggly Wiggly (various Southern states), and Tops Markets (New York and Pennsylvania).

A three times Triple Crown winner, Brice was known for his tough and aggressive tackling play.Thomas (1979), pg 25. Brice was one of several 'Valley forwards' who was chosen to represent his country at the turn of the century. Although he began his international career with Aberavon, a club he would captain from 1901 to 1903; he would later play for Cardiff. Rugby career Brice was first capped for Wales in a home game at St Helens in 1899 against England; though it would be the final match of the tournament against Ireland in which Brice showed his worth to the Welsh squad. After Billy Bancroft was injured after being thrown into the crowd, the Welsh were a man down to a highly motivated Irish team. Brice tackled well and covered the loose ball in a match that was disturbed by constant pitch invasions. Although Wales lost by a solitary try it showed a strong defence that would serve Wales well as they entered their first 'Golden Era'. Brice played every match in the six consecutive Home Nations tournaments. Although Brice was normally known for keeping his cool under pressure, in the 1904 match against Ireland he was reported for calling the referee, a 'thundering idiot', though it is believed his actual language was worse than that on the report. The WFU demanded that Brice apologise to Findaly, the referee, but Brice refused stating that he never used the language.Smith (1980), pg 122.

Life Gibbons was born in 1544, at or near Wells, Somerset. The Jesuit Richard Gibbons was his younger brother. Gibbons entered Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1561, but left the university without a degree. After studying philosophy and theology for seven years in the German College in Rome, he obtained doctorates in both in 1576 and was ordained a Catholic priest. Pope Gregory XIII gave Gibbons a canonry in the cathedral of the Archdiocese of Cologne, which was then located in Bonn, Germany. He resigned this post in 1578 on entering the Society of Jesus at Trier. In the college of this latter place he filled successively the offices of confessor, professor of theology, professor of Sacred Scripture, prefect of studies, and rector. He became known on account of his controversial talents, which he displayed in frequent contests with the Lutheran theologians of Germany. When Cardinal William Allen suggested Gibbons as a fit candidate for the underground mission to the recusant Catholics of England, the latter wrote both to the Superior General of the Society and Allen, that he hoped he should give no disedification by saying that he had not the spiritual strength necessary for such an enterprise, but that he would lend it all the assistance in his power. Gibbons died on 16 August or 3 December 1589, during a visit to Himmerod Abbey, near Trier. Works Among Gibbon's literary works is \\"Concertatio Ecclesi√¶ Catholic√¶ in Anglica, adversus Calvino-Papistas et Puritanos\\" (Trier, 1583). The work was republished on a larger scale in 1588 and 1594, by Dr. John Bridgewater, who numbered among his assistants Cardinal Allen and Dr. Humphrey Ely. Dr. Bridgewater also edited (see, however, Dictionary of National Biography, s. v.) a posthumous work of Gibbons entitled \\"Confutatio virulent√¶ disputationis theologic√¶ in qua Georgius Sohn, Professor Academi√¶ Heidelburgensis, conatus est docere Pontificum Romanum esse Antichristum a prophgetis et apostolis pr√¶dictum\\" (Trier, 1589), in which he dealt with the Calvinist attacks on the papacy.

It is supposed to be the formal documentation of Shivaji‚Äôs ideals, principles and policies of state administration. Background In the strict sense, Adnyapatra is not an official document as it does not bear any seal or other traditional signs used to denote the beginning and end of the official document. It is presented in the traditional form supposing as if the ruling teen-age king orders an experienced person in his court to tell him the history and the state policy adopted by his forefathers for his guidance. Date of completion of Adnyapatra is mentioned on the script itself as 19 November 1715. Contents Adnyapatra is a script of about 7000 words in Modi Marathi. It is divided into two sections. The first section comprises the first two chapters which give a brief narration of the achievements of Shivaji and his sons in building and preserving the Maratha Empire. The second section comprises seven chapters in which he discusses the principles of state policy and various aspects of administration he had learned while working with Shivaji. Chapters *1) Introduction (Part I) : A brief history of Pre- Shivaji times as well as Shivaji‚Äôs times *2) Introduction (Part II) : A brief history of Post-Shivaji Times *3) King ‚Äì Duties & Responsibilities, Administration, Appointments *4) Ministers ‚Äì Eligibility, RolebJ. hs?ohc1ph1xpuvx *5) Merchants ‚Äì Importance, Growth *6) Vatandars (Estate Holders) ‚Äì Facts, Preservation, discontinuation *7) Vrittis (Land Gifts) and Inams (Gifts) ‚Äì Disadvantages, Ways and Means *8) Forts ‚Äì Protection, Construction & Reconstruction *9) Navy ‚Äì Importance, Precautions Select Principles *One State, One Rule. *All other objectives are fulfilled once functions of the state are smoothen. *The king should always worry about his repute. *The people to be appointed in different departments and at the royal kitchens, reservoirs, warehouses etc. should be trustworthy and selfless. *Colleagues should neither be underestimated nor insulted in public. *Advisors should be wise and intelligent. *Administration should not be single handed. *Many should not suffer for one‚Äôs pleasure. *Interaction with spies should be very often. *The suspect should be suspended unless and until doubts are cleared. *Inefficient officers should be sidetracked and relieved skillfully. *Punishment should be inevitable in the event of a crime or injustice. *Reduction in Revenue weakens the power. *Try for more after proper management of what already got. *Ministers are pillars of the state structure. *Delegate them full powers and make them full responsible. *A Mirasdar or Vatandar may be appointed on a fort not located in his own area. *Beware, however, from British Merchants and never give them land to permanently settle. *Protecting yourself is as important as thrashing the enemy *The one who possesses Navy shall possess the sea. *Be careful during war, be more careful during surrender by the enemy. Comparison *Most of the administrative aspects given in ‚ÄòAdnyapatra‚Äô are similar to those mentioned in Kautilya‚Äôs Arthashastra and in some cases the former can be well regarded as extension of the later. *Mestakas compiled by Hemadpant, the Prime Minister of Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri during 13th Century, deal mainly with the procedure whereas ‚ÄòAdnyapatra‚Äô mainly deals with principles of the state policy. *In Utopia Sir Thomas More presents an imaginary world with certain ideals and principles which can not be considered realistic. In Adnyapatra, however, Ramchandra Pant Amatya being a contemporary and close colleague of Shivaji, seems to have copied historically true contents after the manner of Shivaji proving them to be most realistic and genuine. Controversy According to historians Sir Jadunath Sarkar, V.B.Kolte and S.N.Banhatti, the authorship of Adnyapatra is denied to Ramchandra Pant Amatya on the following grounds : *There is no evidence supporting the authorship of Ramchandra Pant Amatya in the text itself. *The beginning and end of this script contains matter praising Ramchandra Pant Amatya and hence it is argued that no sensible author would write in such eulogistic terms about himself. *Ramchandra Pant Amatya‚Äôs own behavior in respect of Vatans is inconsistent with the anti-land grant policy enunciated in the Adnyapatra. Refutation These charges have, however, been refuted by historians T S Shejwalkar, G.H.Khare, S.N.Joshi and R.C.Dhere and were well supported by Govind Sakharam Sardesai and Datto Vaman Potdar on the following grounds : *Adnyapatra was written in the traditional form of Bakhar where the Author doesn‚Äôt take credit of his own works but presents it as if the king is ordering him to write or act. *The honorific titles appended to Ramchandra Pant Amatya in the beginning and at the end of the script could also be found to have prefixed to the names of many ordinary and incompetent officers in the historical papers. It was not a matter of praise but a style or normal practice of those days. *Regarding Vatans and Vritties, Ramchandra Pant Amatya had to overlook certain guidelines of Shivaji during the independence war from 1689 to 1707 as the circumstances had totally changed. He had to offer Vatans and Vritties to attract Maratha Generals whom Mughals had already offered similar land gifts. Supposing that Ramchandra Pant himself was greedy of such Vatans, he can at the most be considered as a person of loose character but his authorship can‚Äôt positively be challenged. *Lastly, Ramchandra Pant Amatya was the only living person who was contemporary of four successive sovereigns (Shivaji, Sambhaji, Rajaram and Shivaji II) and who had the ripe experience expressed in the Adnyapatra. None other than him could have written so meticulously about Navy and Capitalistic European Merchants as none else had direct touch with the coastal affairs.

The competition had been organised by the Sydney Fountains Committee, which was established in September 1958. Its aim was to put fountains in public places in Sydney to enhance their natural beauty and to commemorate families, individuals and organisations. A Designs Committee was responsible for the design competitions for fountains in a number of selected sites, such as the Fitzroy Gardens in Kings Cross, Moore Park, Customs House Square, and Macquarie Place. The competition for the Fitzroy Gardens fountain was assessed by a panel of architects (Max Collard, President of the RAIA (NSW Chapter), and Professor Leslie Wilkinson), sculptors (Douglas Annand), and the City Council.C. Garth, Director of Parks The Committee's design brief for the fountain was: \\"The fountain shall cost not more than complete. Whilst the fountain is not to be a war memorial in the generally accepted sense, it is nevertheless contemplated that Fitzroy Gardens will become a local assembly point on Anzac Day and the fountain will be known as a war memorial fountain.\\" This association between the park and a war memorial began in October 1957 when the Kings Cross Sub-Branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia approached the Council about the possibility of changing the name of the park to El Alamein Park. In December 1958 the Council resolved to hold a public competition for designs for a fountain to be provided in Fitzroy Gardens that may also serve as a memorial.Oultram, 2010, p38 The Australasian Post explained further: 'The plan for the fountain was suggested by the King's Cross RSL, when they asked that a place be set aside for memorial services \\"because older servicemen are finding it very difficult to get to and from the Memorial gates opposite the wharves in Woolloomooloo\\".Australasian Post, 21/ December 1967, pp12-13.

The jury considered there could hardly be a more appropriate recipient of this first Civic Design Award'.Building Lighting Engineering, Oct 1965, p9 An article in the popular magazine Australasian Post in 1967 stated:Australasian Post, 21/12/1967, pp12-13 Freeland's Architecture in Australia, 1967 stated:Freeland, 1967, p313 Carol Henty wrote for The Bulletin in 1978:Henty, 1978, p53 In an interview with Woodward in 1996, architectural historians Paul Alan Johnson and Susan Lorne Johnson stated, 'Australians really seem to have taken the fountain to their hearts... Australians don't usually seem to be overly enthusiastic about their sculpture or their architecture... The fountain is now an icon in Australia and internationally admired'.Johnson, 1996, p193, 195 'The El Alamein Fountain represents an important technological innovation in fountain design, and has been much replicated throughout the world.'Keys Young, Draft Plan of Management for Fitzroy Gardens, , p29 Cultural impact The fountain won Woodward the New South Wales Institute of Architects Civic Design Award in 1964. Over the years, its iconic shape has made it a well-known landmark that has been imitated by other builders. As the focal point of the Kings Cross area, the fountain often serves as a meeting place.  Description  'This fountain has a globe-like shape, with a diameter of 12 ft 6 in (3.81 m) and comprises 211 radially arranged \\"stalks\\" fitted to a hollow metal globe, itself placed on top of a brass pipe column with a length of 10 ft (3.05 m) and a diameter of 4 in. (10 cm). The central globe is made of cast brass [in fact bronze, according to CMP] and its diameter measures 46 cm. Each stalk consists of a tube 1.5 inch [2 cm] thick at the base and reducing to 0.5 inch [0.8 cm] at the outer end. A specially constructed nozzle has been fitted to each of these extremities. . . [There are] three terraced pools made of concrete and covered with white mosaic glass tiles. The perimeter coping is faced with quartzite and the two upper pools' spillways are formed by bronze dentils. The water is pumped through the line strainer - at a rate of 500 gallons (2,270 litres) per minute and a pressure of 22 lb. [10 kg] per square inch - up to the central sphere where it emerges from each of the 211 nozzles as a thin 18 inch [45 cm] disc of water. These disks of water merge and create the impression of a huge thistledown [or dandelion]. The water from the nozzles falls first to the top pool and then runs between the spillway dentils from pool to pool. Through nine glory hole outlets and underground pipes the water returns into the screening baskets and back to the tanks so that it can circulate again.'.International Lighting Review, 1963 The glory holes compensate almost exactly for the consecutive reduction in weir length from pool to pool. Each glory hole drains the equivalent of ~32 troughs. This means that the weirs draining the pools and all 9 glory holes have identical flow. The fountain sits above the top pool of a series of four pools, set among cobblestone paving near the south-western edge of Fitzroy Gardens. As the land is sloping gently eastward, its design responds to the site, with successive pools lower down this slope towards the east. The top pool in which the fountain apparatus is mounted is hexagonal in form. Lower pools reflect this form but are larger, with expanded dimensions. A series of spillway dentils in bronze direct water down from pool to pool through a fine series of \\"teeth\\" which make a very precise noise, helping dull traffic noise.Stuart Read, personal communication, 8/6/10 Plaques Below ground to its immediate north-east is the fountain's pump room, which houses its operative mechanisms. Also to the north east of the fountain is a plinth with two plaques which read: 'THE EL ALAMEIN MEMORIAL FOUNTAIN THIS FOUNTAIN WAS ERECTED IN COMMEMORIATION OF THE DEEDS OF THE NINTH DIVISION, AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL FORCES IN WORLD WAR II BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SYDNEY AND PLACED IN OPERATION BY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORD MAYOR OF SYDNEY ALDERMAN H.F.

ADAMS TOWN CLERK' 'THIS FOUNTAIN WAS DESIGNED BY AND CONSTRUCTED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF WOODWARD & TARANTO ARCHITECTS' The complete fountain head above the waterline and stalks were originally manufactured by Eric L. Williams under the supervision of Robert Woodward. Lighting installation At night, this lighted fountain makes the impression of a display of fireworks bursting asunder. The light emanates from six reflector lamps of 500 W, mounted under the water-level of the upper basin. These lamps are placed around the main delivery pipe, in a circle with a diameter of some 1.20 m. Each lamp is mounted in a metal cylinder with a clear Pyrex glass cover and a bronze-coloured spun metal shielding ring which projects several inches above the water level. For maintenance purposes the cylinders can be reached from the equipment room under the central pool. This room houses a 25 h.p. electric motor, a 3-inch pump, a 3-inch strainer, switchboards and a set of three stainless steel screening baskets. Below the floor is a concrete tank of 3,000 gallons (ca 13 cu. m.). The operation of the fountain is controlled by a time switch.' Other site observations Two \\"London / hybrid\\" plane, Platanus x acerifolia (syn. P. x hispanica) trees dating from the time when the fountain was completed are considered to be of significance. The curtilage for the SHR listing is in the shape of a triangle with its three corners enclosing the three main viewing cones towards the fountain, from Darlinghurst Road, from Macleay Street north and from the Police Station. Within this curtilage are many non-significant or intrusive urban design elements including: roads and traffic signals; a Telstra telephone booth; a glass enclosed bus shelter; a tourist sign-post showing directions / distance to numerous world cities; a light post with multiple circular lights; a large bronze sculpture \\"Angled Wheels of Fortune\\" designed and donated by property developer Dennis Wolanski in 1988;Oultram, 2010, p434 a cafe with large awnings and cafe furniture; and a significant amount of recently planted vegetation. Although worthwhile in their own right, many of these elements interfere with views towards the fountain and should be repositioned when possible.  Heritage listing  As at 28 October 2010, The El Alamein Memorial Fountain is of State significance as a spectacular fountain and outstanding work of modernist design in water which has been copied all over the world. Throughout the decades of the 1960s and 1970s it was an icon of Sydney, rivalling the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House for the frequency with which it was represented in tourism imagery. Aesthetically it is rare in NSW as a local adaptation of the organic school of Scandinavian architectural design and as an example of the application of modernist design technology to fountain design. The El Alamein Memorial Fountain is of State significance as a war memorial to the Australian soldiers of the 9th Division who fought near the Egyptian town of El Alamein in two battles which helped turn the course of World War II towards victory for the Allies. It is also of State significance for its associations with its designer Bob Woodward, a World War II veteran whose career was consequently shifted into national and international prominence as a fountain designer largely because of its popular and critical success. It is rare as a war memorial in NSW which commemorates a battle rather than the loss of individual members of the armed forces. It is also unusual because its beauty as a fountain has historically almost overwhelmed its solemn function a war memorial. El Alamein Memorial Fountain was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 14 January 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The El Alamein Memorial Fountain is of State historical heritage significance as a war memorial to the battles fought by Australian soldiers near the Egyptian town of El Alamein which helped turn the course of World War II towards victory for the Allies. The Australians paid a fearful price for their involvement, suffering almost 6,000 casualties between July and November 1942. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The El Alamein Memorial Fountain is of State significance for its historical associations with the Australian soldiers of the 9th Division who fought near the Egyptian town of El Alamein in two battles which helped turn the course of World War II. It is also of State significance for its associations with its designer Bob Woodward, a World War II veteran whose career as a fountain designer was consequently reoriented into national and international prominence largely because of its popular and critical success. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The El Alamein Memorial Fountain is of State aesthetic significance as a spectacular fountain and outstanding work of modernist design in water which has been copied all over the world. It was described by architectural historian Max Freeland as \\"a splendid sculpture in water. Its ephemeral ever-changing ever-remaining lightness dances tantalizingly in the sunshine or turns the reflections of gaudy neon lights into jewels at night. Its poetry was a sculptural breakthrough not only in Australia but in the world\\". Throughout the decades of the 1960s and 1970s it was an icon of Sydney, rivalling the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House for the frequency with which it was represented in tourism imagery. Described as \\"an important technological innovation in fountain design\\" (,Keys Young, , p29 the NSW chapter of the Institute of Architects created a new design category for it, the \\"Civic Design Award\\" of which it became the inaugural winner in 1964. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The El Alamein Memorial Fountain is of State significance for its rarity as a war memorial in NSW which commemorates a battle rather than the loss of individual members of the armed forces. It is also unusual because its beauty as a fountain has historically almost overwhelmed its solemn function as a war memorial. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The El Alamein Memorial Fountain is of State significance as an example of internationally outstanding fountain design and representative of excellence in Australian modernist design of the mid twentieth century.

Equivalently, a sectrix of Maclaurin can be defined as a curve whose equation in biangular coordinates is linear. The name is derived from the trisectrix of Maclaurin (named for Colin Maclaurin), which is a prominent member of the family, and their sectrix property, which means they can be used to divide an angle into a given number of equal parts. There are special cases are also known as arachnida or araneidans because of their spider-like shape, and Plateau curves after Joseph Plateau who studied them. Equations in polar coordinates We are given two lines rotating about two poles P and P_1. By translation and rotation we may assume P = (0,0) and P_1 = (a, 0). At time t, the line rotating about P has angle \\\\theta = \\\\kappa t + \\\\alpha and the line rotating about P_1 has angle \\\\theta_1 = \\\\kappa_1 t + \\\\alpha_1, where \\\\kappa, \\\\alpha, \\\\kappa_1 and \\\\alpha_1 are constants. Eliminate t to get \\\\theta_1 = q \\\\theta + \\\\theta_0 where q = \\\\kappa_1 / \\\\kappa and \\\\theta_0 = \\\\alpha_1 - q \\\\alpha. We assume q is rational, otherwise the curve is not algebraic and is dense in the plane. Let Q be the point of intersection of the two lines and let \\\\psi be the angle at Q, so \\\\psi = \\\\theta_1 - \\\\theta. If r is the distance from P to Q then, by the law of sines, :{r \\\\over \\\\sin \\\\theta_1} = {a \\\\over \\\\sin \\\\psi}\\\\\\\\! so :r = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin \\\\theta_1}{\\\\sin \\\\psi} = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin [q \\\\theta + \\\\theta_0]}{\\\\sin [(q-1) \\\\theta + \\\\theta_0]}\\\\\\\\! is the equation in polar coordinates. The case \\\\theta_0 = 0 and q = n where n is an integer greater than 2 gives arachnida or araneidan curves :r = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin n \\\\theta}{\\\\sin (n-1) \\\\theta}\\\\\\\\! The case \\\\theta_0 = 0 and q = -n where n is an integer greater than 1 gives alternate forms of arachnida or araneidan curves :r = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin n \\\\theta}{\\\\sin (n+1) \\\\theta}\\\\\\\\! A similar derivation to that above gives :r_1 = (-a) \\\\frac {\\\\sin [(1/q) \\\\theta_1 - \\\\theta_0 /q]}{\\\\sin [(1/q-1) \\\\theta_1 - \\\\theta_0 /q]}\\\\\\\\! as the polar equation (in r_1 and \\\\theta_1) if the origin is shifted to the right by a. Note that this is the earlier equation with a change of parameters; this to be expected from the fact that two poles are interchangeable in the construction of the curve. Equations in the complex plane, rectangular coordinates and orthogonal trajectories Let q = m/n where m and n are integers and the fraction is in lowest terms. In the notation of the previous section, we have \\\\theta_1 = q \\\\theta + \\\\theta_0 or n \\\\theta_1 = m \\\\theta + n \\\\theta_0. If z = x + iy then \\\\theta = \\\\arg(z),\\\\ \\\\theta_1 = \\\\arg(z-a), so the equation becomes n\\\\ \\\\arg(z-a) = m\\\\ \\\\arg(z) + n\\\\ \\\\theta_0 or m\\\\ \\\\arg(z) - n\\\\ \\\\arg(z-a) = \\\\arg(z^m (z-a)^{-n} ) = const. This can also be written :\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{Re}(z^m (z-a)^{-n})}{\\\\operatorname{Im}(z^m (z-a)^{-n})} = const. from which it is relatively simple to derive the Cartesian equation given m and n. The function w = z^m (z-a)^{-n} is analytic so the orthogonal trajectories of the family arg(w) = const. are the curves w = const, or \\\\frac{z^m}{z-a^n} = const. Parametric equations Let q = m/n where m and n are integers, and let \\\\theta = n p where p is a parameter. Then converting the polar equation above to parametric equations produces : x = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin [m p + \\\\theta_0] \\\\cos n p}{\\\\sin [(m - n) p + \\\\theta_0]}, y = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin [m p + \\\\theta_0] \\\\sin n p}{\\\\sin [(m - n) p + \\\\theta_0]}\\\\\\\\!. Applying the angle addition rule for sine produces : x = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin [m p + \\\\theta_0] \\\\cos n p}{\\\\sin [(m - n) p + \\\\theta_0]} = a + a \\\\frac {\\\\cos [m p + \\\\theta_0] \\\\sin n p}{\\\\sin [(m - n) p + \\\\theta_0]} = {a \\\\over 2} + {a \\\\over 2} \\\\frac {\\\\sin [(m + n) p + \\\\theta_0]}{\\\\sin [(m - n) p + \\\\theta_0]}\\\\\\\\! . So if the origin is shifted to the right by a/2 then the parametric equations are :x = {a \\\\over 2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac {\\\\sin [(m + n) p + \\\\theta_0]}{\\\\sin [(m - n) p + \\\\theta_0]}, y = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin [m p + \\\\theta_0] \\\\sin n p}{\\\\sin [(m - n) p + \\\\theta_0]}\\\\\\\\!. These are the equations for Plateau curves when \\\\theta_0 = 0, or :x = {a \\\\over 2} \\\\frac {\\\\sin (m + n) p}{\\\\sin (m - n) p}, y = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin m p \\\\sin n p}{\\\\sin (m - n) p}\\\\\\\\!. Inversive triplets The inverse with respect to the circle with radius a and center at the origin of :r = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin [q \\\\theta + \\\\theta_0]}{\\\\sin [(q-1) \\\\theta + \\\\theta_0]} is :r = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin [(q-1) \\\\theta + \\\\theta_0]}{\\\\sin [q \\\\theta + \\\\theta_0]} = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin [(1-q) \\\\theta - \\\\theta_0]}{\\\\sin [((1-q)-1) \\\\theta - \\\\theta_0]}. This is another curve in the family. The inverse with respect to the other pole produces yet another curve in the same family and the two inverses are in turn inverses of each other. Therefore each curve in the family is a member of a triple, each of which belongs to the family and is an inverse of the other two. The values of q in this family are :q,\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{q},\\\\ 1-q, \\\\frac{1}{1-q},\\\\ \\\\frac{q-1}{q},\\\\ \\\\frac{q}{q-1}. Sectrix properties Let q = m/n where m and n are integers in lowest terms and assume \\\\theta_0 is constructible with compass and straightedge. (The value of \\\\theta_0 is usually 0 in practice so this is not normally an issue.) Let \\\\varphi be a given angle and suppose that the sectrix of Maclaurin has been drawn with poles P and P_1 according to the construction above. Construct a ray from P_1 at angle \\\\varphi+\\\\theta_0 and let Q be the point of intersection of the ray and the sectrix and draw PQ. If \\\\theta is the angle of this line then :\\\\varphi+\\\\theta_0=\\\\theta_1=q \\\\theta + \\\\theta_0 so \\\\theta = \\\\frac{n\\\\varphi}{m}. By repeatedly subtracting \\\\theta and \\\\varphi from each other as in the Euclidean algorithm, the angle \\\\varphi/m can be constructed. Thus, the curve is an m-sectrix, meaning that with the aid of the curve an arbitrary angle can be divided by any integer. This is a generalization of the concept of a trisectrix and examples of these will be found below. Now draw a ray with angle \\\\varphi from P and Q' be the point of intersection of this ray with the curve. The angle of P'Q' is :\\\\theta_1=q\\\\theta+\\\\theta_0=q\\\\varphi+\\\\theta_0 and subtracting \\\\theta_0 gives an angle of :q\\\\varphi = \\\\frac{m\\\\varphi}{n}. Applying the Euclidean Algorithm again gives an angle of \\\\varphi/n showing that the curve is also an n-sectrix. Finally, draw a ray from P with angle \\\\pi/2-\\\\varphi-\\\\theta_0 and a ray from P' with angle \\\\pi/2+\\\\varphi+\\\\theta_0, and let C be the point of intersection. This point is on the perpendicular bisector of PP' so there is a circle with center C containing P and P'. \\\\angle PCP' = 2(\\\\varphi+\\\\theta_0) so any point on the circle forms an angle of \\\\varphi+\\\\theta_0 between P and P'. (This is, in fact, one of the Apollonian circles of P and P.) Let Q be the point intersection of this circle and the curve. Then \\\\varphi+\\\\theta_0 = \\\\angle PQP' = \\\\psi = \\\\theta_1-\\\\theta = (q-1)\\\\theta+\\\\theta_0 so :\\\\varphi = \\\\frac{(m-n)\\\\theta}{n},\\\\ \\\\theta=\\\\frac{n\\\\theta}{m-n}. Applying a Euclidean algorithm a third time gives an angle of \\\\varphi/(m-n), showing that the curve is an (m‚àín)-sectrix as well. Specific cases=q = 0 This is the curve :r = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin \\\\theta_0}{\\\\sin (-\\\\theta + \\\\theta_0)} which is line through (a, 0) q = 1 This is a circle containing the origin and (a, 0). It has polar equation :r = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin (\\\\theta + \\\\theta_0)}{\\\\sin \\\\theta_0}. It is the inverse with respect to the origin of the q = 0 case. The orthogonal trajectories of the family of circles is the family \\\\frac{z-a}{z} = const. These form the Apollonian circles with poles (0, 0) and (a, 0). q = -1 These curves have polar equation :r = a \\\\frac {\\\\sin (-\\\\theta + \\\\theta_0)}{\\\\sin (-2\\\\theta + \\\\theta_0)}, complex equation arg(z(z-a)) = const. In rectangular coordinates this becomes x^2 - y^2 - x = c(2xy - y) which is a conic. From the polar equation it is evident that the curves has asymptotes at \\\\theta = \\\\theta_0 /2 and \\\\theta_0 /2 + \\\\pi/2 which are at right angles. So the conics are, in fact, rectangular hyperbolas. The center of the hyperbola is always (a/2, 0). The orthogonal trajectories of this family are given by zz-a = c which is the family of Cassini ovals with foci (0, 0) and (a, 0). Trisectrix of Maclaurin In the case where q=3 (or q=1/3 by switching the poles) and \\\\theta_0 = 0, the equation is :r= a \\\\frac{\\\\sin 3\\\\theta}{\\\\sin 2\\\\theta} = {a \\\\over 2} \\\\frac{4 \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta - 1} {\\\\cos \\\\theta} = {a \\\\over 2} (4 \\\\cos \\\\theta - \\\\sec \\\\theta). This is the Trisectrix of Maclaurin which is specific case whose generalization is the sectrix of Maclaurin. The construction above gives a method that this curve may be used as a trisectrix. Lima√ßon trisectrix In the case where q=3/2 (or q=2/3 by switching the poles) and \\\\theta_0 = 0, the equation is :r=a \\\\frac {\\\\sin \\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\theta}{\\\\sin \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\theta} = a(3\\\\cos^2 \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\theta - \\\\sin^2 \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\theta) = a(1+2\\\\cos\\\\theta). This is the Lima√ßon trisectrix. The equation with the origin take to be the other pole is :r=-a \\\\frac {\\\\sin \\\\tfrac{2}{3}\\\\theta}{\\\\sin -\\\\tfrac{1}{3}\\\\theta} = 2a\\\\cos \\\\tfrac{1}{3}\\\\theta. The 3 in the numerator of q and the construction above give a method that the curve may be used as a trisectrix.

Using extensive testimony of refugees from Egypt, Yemen, Libya, Iraq, and Morocco, the film weaves personal stories with dramatic archival footage of rescue missions, historic images of exodus and resettlement, and analyses by contemporary scholars to tell the story of how and why the Jewish population in the Middle East and North Africa declined from one million in 1945 to several thousand today. Interviewees Personalities interviewed in the film include: * Irwin Cotler, Canadian member of parliament and international human rights lawyer * Mordechai Ben-Porat, Iraqi Jew and facilitator of the mass emigration of Iraqi Jews between 1949 and 1951 * Gina Waldman, Libyan Jew and current head of JIMENA (Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa) * Raphael Israeli, Moroccan Jew and Israeli academic * Linda Abdul Aziz Menuhin - an Iraqi Jew who is also the subject of the 2013 documentary Shadow in Baghdad. Releases Shown at multiple Jewish film festivals in the US and worldwide and on public television networks, the film was also screened at the second annual UN panel on Jewish refugees from Arab countries. It was also shown at a hearing held by the US Congressional Human Rights Caucus which heard testimonies on the issue of Jewish refugees from Arab countries. The film is recommended as a resource for activists on the issue of Jewish refugees from Arab countries.

He was educated in Eraniel in the Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu, India. Robinson later studied at Scott Christian College and obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics. Robinson decided to pursue the priesthood, and his Church sponsored his theological studies. In 1957, Robinson joined the United Theological College and enrolled himself for a Bachelor of Divinity degree which he completed by 1960. Later, his Church assigned him a pastoral role, and Robinson served as Presbyter-in- Charge of the Kanyakumari District. Robinson was zealous for his studies and obtained permission from his diocese to pursue a Master of Theology degree in Bengaluru. Robinson chose to specialise in Old Testament studies and studied between 1961 ‚Äì 1963. Robinson left India in 1964 for North America and joined the Union Theological Seminary of New York City and obtained a Master of Sacred Theology degree. Gnana also did a course in the Tantur Ecumenical Institute for Theological Studies in Israel. Robinson went on to pursue doctoral studies in the University of Hamburg in Germany. He registered himself at the School of Evangelical Theology and obtained a Doctor of Theology degree 1975. Robinson considered Klaus Koch, a professor at the university and a notable Old Testament scholar, to be his guru.Gnana Robinson acknowledges Dr. Klaus Koch to be his guru in his foreword to Klaus Koch's From Amos to Jesus: Biblical Eschatology and Its Social and Political Implications, UTC, 1999,  Professorship  Robinson began his teaching career at what was then the Tamil Nadu Theological College (now the Tamil Nadu Theological Seminary) in 1962. In 1987, Robinson accepted an invitation from the Predigerseminar at Soest, Germany to teach there. Later that year, however, the Principal of the United Theological College in Bengaluru, India, Rev. Dr. E. C. John, retired, and the school formed a committee to find a replacement. Robinson accepted their invitation to return to India and become Principal there, and also headed their Department of Old Testament studies. Professor Gnana has been invited to other institutions as well, where he taught for shorter periods of time. He was Visiting Professor at the University of Hamburg in 1982, and also taught at the St. Andrew's Theological College in the West Indies that same year. He taught at the Andover Newton Theological School in Massachusetts in 1983 as well as at the Lincoln Theological College in the United Kingdom.

By the end of his journey in 1995, Scotto went through 13 64-page passports and his motorcycle received one replacement engine, consumed of gasoline, of oil, 86 tires, 12 batteries and nine new seats.Emilio Scotto Record for the world‚Äôs longest motorcycle ride. Source: Taringa. Scotto's odyssey was often perilous, including journeys through Nicaragua in 1985 during its civil war and Kuwait prior to the 1991 invasion by Iraq. The most dangerous part of his trip, he would later recall, came in Africa when he was arrested as a suspected spy in Burundi, Chad and Cameroon. He was also jailed on suspicion of carrying a forged passport in Zimbabwe. In Liberia, he came into the country during a period of military upheaval and needed to hide in a diplomatic compound in Monrovia for several days until he could receive safe passage out of the country. Scotto was not able to arrange to bring his motorcycle into North Korea, but he was able to walk by foot the demarcation zone separating that country from South Korea. He was nearly denied access to China when border officials insisted that he pay a $70,000 entry fee. Intervention by the Motorcycle Club of Beijing helped him enter the country without any prepayment. Although Scotto did not publicize his journey when he first departed, news of his adventure began to spread during his travels. In late 1986, when he was stranded in New York City, a television news report helped bring in donations that allowed him to cross the ocean. Scotto was able to personally present a letter to Pope John Paul II at the Vatican, and Libyan leader Col. Muammar al-Gaddafi provided him with $300 for the African portion of his journey. During the later part of his journey, he received corporate sponsorship from Pepsi, Agip and Metzeler. In 1991, Scotto married Monica Pino in New Delhi, India. She was his companion on the final four years of his trek.

History  The line was opened 1886 but it was not until 1913 that the station was opened as part of a drive by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) to cut costs and increase revenues on the Gravesend West branch. Longfield Halt was now the first station on the line and was situated ¬æ mile from Fawkham Junction in a chalk cutting just to the south-west of a road bridge carrying Whitehill Road over the line. The station was constructed entirely of wood, with access being had from a staircase leading down from the overbridge. Its opening coincided with the introduction by the SECR of push-pull trains, initially worked by H class 0-4-4Ts with ex- South Eastern Railway 4 wheel coaches, running between Swanley Junction and Gravesend West Street. Although ultimately never successful, the line began to suffer in the face of competition from local bus services following the Second World War, and freight dropped off. The decision was therefore made to close all stations on the branch line to passenger traffic as from 3 August 1953. In 1959, the line was singled and the platform buildings at Longfield Halt were demolished along with those at neighbouring Southfleet.Oppitz, L., op. cit. p. 100. The line running through Longfield remained open for freight until 1976, and the track remained even as late as 1985.  Present day  The site of Longfield Halt has been incorporated into the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) which runs from London through Kent to the British side of the Channel Tunnel.

Tice (1938-) is an American photographer, best known for his meticulously crafted black and white prints in silver gelatin and platinum, as well as his books, which depict a broad range of American life, landscape, and urban environment, mostly photographed in his native New Jersey, where he has lived all his life, except for his service in the U. S. Navy, a brief period in California, a fellowship in the United Kingdom, and summer workshops in Maine, where he taught at the Maine Photographic Workshops, now the Maine Media Workshops. Early life and entry into photography George A. Tice, born in Newark, New Jersey, October 13, 1938, the son of a college-educated New Jerseyan, William S. Tice, and Margaret Robertson, a Traveller of Irish, Scottish, and Welsh stock with a fourth grade education. George was raised by his mother, maintaining regular visiting contact with his father, whose influence and advice he valued highly.\\"George A. Tice,\\" by Maria C. S√°nchez, in The Encyclopedia of Twentieth Century Photography, ed. Lynne Warren, Routledge, New York, London, 2005, p. 1538. His first contact with photography was in the albums of family photographs belonging to his father, and this gave him the desire to create images of his own. He began with a Kodak Brownie. In 1953, having bought a Kodak Pony, which gave him some control over exposure and focus, and a Kodak developing kit, he began to advance his craft. He also joined the Carteret Camera Club. Tice's photographs of homeless men on the Bowery won second place in the black and white print competitions. He decided at this point to make photography his career. In 1955 he attended the Newark Vocational and Technical High School, where he briefly studied commercial photography under Harve Wobbe. When he turned sixteen, he quit school and took a job as a darkroom assistant for Classic Photo, a portrait studio in Newark. He also worked as a stock boy at Kreske's Department Store in Newark, then as an office boy in the circulation department of the Newark Evening News. It was at this job he learned about the death of the actor James Dean through a clipping about his death. Tice later adopted Dean as one of his subjects in Hometowns - An American Pilgrimage. In 1956 Tice enlisted in the United States Navy, in which he rose to the rank of Photographer's Mate Third Class. After boot camp and two years at Naval Air Station Memphis, he was transferred to sea duty aboard the aircraft carrier, USS Wasp (CV-18). One of the photographs he made on board, Explosion Aboard the U.S.S. Wasp, 1959, was published on the front page of the New York Times. Edward Steichen, then Director of Photography at the Museum of Modern Art, was struck by the image and requested a print for the Museum collection. In that same year Tice received his honorable discharge. Early career In 1960, now a civilian, Tice joined the Vailsburg Camera Club and took a job as a family portrait photographer for Americana Portraits. As an active member of the club, he exhibited in international salons. That same year he began to make short trips to Lancaster County, Pennsylvania to photograph the Amish and Mennonite communities, using 35mm and medium format cameras. In 1964 he began his series of tree photographs. By then he had learned all he could from the disciplines of the camera club and brought his involvement to an end. Tice had his first solo exhibition at the Underground Gallery, New York and then decided to move with his family to California, where he continued his work in family portraits, but pursuing artistic projects like his series on the ghost town of Bodie, California on the edge of the Sierra Nevada range. When his wife, Marie, became homesick, he returned to New Jersey, where, as he had learned, the family portrait business was considerably more profitable than on the West Coast. In 1967 he bought a 4 x 5 Deardorff view camera and made studies of ice formations. In the same year he traded in his 4 x 5 for an 8 x 10 view camera and began his aquatic plant series. He also produced his first photographs of Paterson, New Jersey, which became the subject of two books and exhibitions, Paterson and Paterson II. The following year he published The Amish Portfolio, a set of twelve, limited-edition prints with an introduction by Jacob Deschin. With his advance from Doubleday for Fields of Peace he bought a brand new 8 x 10 Deardorff, which remains his preferred instrument today. Maturity Tice met Lee Witkin in 1968 and used his knowledge of photography and its history to help him establish the Witkin Gallery in New York, one of the first successful galleries of photographic prints as fine art. He issued the portfolio, Trees, taught a workshop at Aspen, Colorado, and began to experiment with platinum printing, a lost art since the First World War, when wartime platinum prices forced the manufacturers of the special printing paper out of business. The only documentation of the process consisted of William Willis' original patents, which did not provide enough information for Tice to prepare the paper and use it to make prints. Tice had to reinvent the platinum printing for himself. He published what he learned in an article, \\"The Lost Art of Platinum,\\" in the December 1970 issue of the British photography journal, Album, edited by Bill Jay. Tice's experimentation with early photographic processes continued in 1972 with his creation of a photogenic drawing of leaves printed in a contact frame exposed to sunlight onto hand- sensitized paper coated with diluted silver nitrate, in the manner of William Henry Fox Talbot, producing a Calotype negative. In 1970 Doubleday published Tice's first book, Fields of Peace: A Pennsylvania German Album, with text by Millen Brand. He began photographing coastal Maine this year and began teaching at the New School for Social Research. That year he also traveled to London and Paris with Lee Witkin in search of material for the Witkin Gallery. They met with Frederick H. Evans' son, who sold Witkin a block of platinum prints and lantern slides. Tice bought some himself, a significant addition to his collection of photographs. George A. Tice, \\"Car for Sale\\" (1969) In 1971, Tice issued his portfolio, Bodie, with an introduction by Lee Witkin, printed an Evans portfolio from lantern slides, and published, again with Doubleday, Goodbye River Goodbye, with poetry by George Mendoza. In 1972 Life magazine sent him on assignment for the article \\"Home to Iowa.\\" Rutgers University Press published Paterson, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art presented a solo exhibition, Paterson, New Jersey. Doubleday published Seacoast, Maine: People and Places, with a text by Martin Dibner. With several books, the Metropolitan Museum exhibition, and representation by Witkin, Tice was established as a major figure in black and white fine art photography. Awards followed. Tice received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation. Paterson was awarded the Grand Prix du Festival d'Arles. Edward Steichen, then in the last year of his life, appointed Tice as printer of his negatives, a duty Tice continued until 1998, printing several important portfolios of Steichen's work. Tice also made prints for portfolios of photographs by Frederick H. Evans, Francis Brugui√®re, and Edward Weston, issued by the Witkin Gallery. Ansel Adams recommended Tice for a commission by the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, to make two sixty-foot murals of Sapelo Island, Georgia, Life magazine sent Tice to Hutchinson, Kansas to contribute to the Special Report, \\"One Day in the Life of America.\\" The Witkin Gallery presented a twenty-year retrospective of Tice's work in 1975, accompanied by the book, George A. Tice, Photographs: 1953-1973, published by the Rutgers University Press. Tice was then thirty-seven. This retrospective marked a crucial point in his career. He had published three major books‚ÄîFields of Peace, Paterson, and Seacoast Maine‚Äîand received the support and recognition of major foundations and museums: the Metropolitan, MoMA (through Steichen), the Field Museum, the Festival d'Arles, the NEA, and the Guggenheim. Tice was established as a classic observer of the American landscape, both urban and rural, and the world of the working American. From then on, he explored his essential subjects in further depth, continued to illustrate the paths of change in America, and to extend them with increased attention to human subjects. Not only did he train his eye and technique on the structures and environments Americans had created for themselves over centuries to live and work in, he began to examine people directly‚Äîalways in the context of their environment, growth, and history, and always with a sympathetic spirit of inquiry. Over the next decades he developed as a photographer-historian‚Äîa quality he had already shown in his interest in the history of photography as a collector and in his study and adoption of historical techniques.Interview with George Tice by John Paul Caponigro Around 1976/77 Tice acquired a Fujica soft-focus lens, and in this he found another avenue to explore the history of photography and to invent it once again for his own artistic purposes. He was fascinated by the firm contours this lens resolved amidst a cloudy glow which emanated from the figure‚Äîan effect fundamentally different from those of the methods employed by modern photographers. Over the next two years he made a series of soft-focus photographs of a girlfriend, Deborah, and three white cats, which belonged to one of his daughters. Urban Landscapes: A New Jersey Portrait followed in 1976, again from the Rutgers University Press, an expansion of Tice's vision of the gritty cities of industrial New Jersey. As in Paterson, Tice explored scenes of the working man's environment that survived only precariously at the time, soon to disappear forever. Although his subject-matter, technique, and style extend far beyond that, almost to the point of universality, the urban scene of New Jersey remains his most familiar vein. Tice's interest in people manifested itself in a small book unlike any he had produced before: Artie Van Blarcum: An Extended Portrait. Artie was a loyal member of the Tri-County Camera Club. When Tice decided to create a book about him, he reluctantly allowed Tice to follow him around as a witness to his daily life. Artie, then 52, was a New Jersey Everyman. Like his grandfather and father before him, Artie worked in a factory. He led a circumscribed existence, sharing the family house with his brother and following a narrow routine of activities, chief among which were the camera club meetings and his excursions along the New Jersey coast in his motorboat. These, and the exhibitions and competitions organized by the club, set the standards and limits of Van Blarcum's photographic work. At every stage of the photographic process, from choice of subject to final print, Artie sought to please the judges. Hence, his work embodies everything that is typical of camera club photography, commonly identified with obsessive technical perfection and banal subject matter. After Artie's death, Tice presented his archives to William Paterson University, which devoted an exhibition to them, September 8 - October 16, 2015: Artie Van Blarcum: Honorable Mention  Later career  Tice prepared the extensive texts himself, quoted from his subject, showing a verbal and editorial gift that served him well in future publications, most importantly Lincoln and Hometowns. Tice's reading of Carl Sandburg's Lincoln in 1981 set off an obsession with Abraham Lincoln, which persists to this day in his collection of Lincoln memorabilia. However, his immediate response to Sandburg's book was to venture out over the United States in search of monuments, statues, and namesakes which don't simply commemorate Lincoln but establish his living presence on common street corners and grand public spaces. In the book we travel through Abraham Lincoln's popular legacy, as we visit the Lincoln Memorial as well as the Lincoln Motel and Abe's Disco in Newark, New Jersey. In 1982 Tice printed a Steichen portfolio, Steichen: Twenty-Five Photographs, and another retrospective monograph, Urban Romantic: The Photographs of George Tice, issued by the esteemed publisher, David R. Godine, marking the beginning of Tice's aim to attempt to equal the quality of his original prints in his books. In 1983 Tice turned to a new subject closely related to Lincoln. He traveled to the Midwest to photograph James Dean's Fairmount, Indiana, Ronald Reagan's Dixon, Illinois, and Mark Twain's Hannibal, Missouri. His fascination with legendary American men inspired him not only to seek out remembrances on every street corner, but to go to the home towns of three Americans who rose from ordinary beginnings to set a historic stamp on society and culture. In his close exploration of the hometowns, he takes the reader on a pilgrimage to honor the men, but above all to honor the social fabric that enabled them to study, create, and rise. The power of the American public high school and the opportunities it provided for actors and writers is especially moving, both in Tice's photographs and in the texts by Dean, Reagan, and Twain in their youth and maturity that Tice selected for the book. Tice had developed into a creator of books as writer and editor as well as a photographer. Tice also regularly taught photography classes at numerous institutions including the Maine Photographic Workshop in Rockport, Maine, and Appalachian Photographic Workshops in Asheville, NC. The following year, Tice visited the U.S.S.R. on a cultural exchange, leading a group of American photographers together with Cole Weston and made some photographs, primarily street portraits. Lincoln was published by the Rutgers University Press, and Tice printed a second Steichen portfolio, In the Studio, 12 photographs. Lee Witkin died in 1985. Evelyne Daitz took over his gallery and continued to run it until 1999. Further Steichen portfolios appeared in 1986, Juxtapositions, 12 photographs, and 1987, The Blue Sky, 12 photographs. Tice was inducted into the New Jersey Literary Hall of Fame and awarded the \\"Michael,\\" a prize designed by Michael Graves. Hometowns: An American Pilgrimage, was published by New York Graphic Society in 1988. Ronald Reagan, the only one of Tice's legends still alive at the time, and in office as President, sent Tice a personal letter of appreciation. In 1990, Tice received a joint fellowship from National Museum of Photography, Film, and Television (now the National Media Museum) in Bradford and from Ilkley College, Ilkley in Northern England. The following year they published the work he did as a fellow, Stone Walls, Grey Skies: A Vision of Yorkshire, consisting of moody, atmospheric views of the countryside and coast. A limited edition portfolio was issued by Prestige Art Ltd. An expanded second edition of the book was published in 1993. George A. Tice, Oak Tree, Holmdel, NJ (1970) In 1992 Tice's interests took a decisive new turn. Ever the historian, Tice began to study his own genealogy, learning that his paternal ancestors were not 19th-century German immigrants, as his father believed, but early arrivals in America. Tice himself is an eleventh- generation American, the descendant of people who emigrated to New Utrecht, Long Island (Brooklyn) from Li√®ge in the seventeenth century. Soon they resettled in New Jersey, founding a long line of farmers and boatmen. Tice's artistic response to what he had learned was a collection of family photographs, letters, and documents related to the family's life in the area where they settled, once called Ticetown, as well as his own photographs of the Tice \\"Homestead,\\" built by Jacob S. Tice in 1848 and home to four generations of Tices. George Tice found this house, in a dilapidated state, only with difficulty. It collapsed into a heap of rubble during the winter of 2005. This work was published by Lodima Press in 2007. Tice returned to the urban landscapes of New Jersey in 1994, when he began a project that was published eight years later as George Tice: Urban Landscapes. In 1997 and 1998, Tice printed more negatives by Steichen for his widow Joanna's book, Steichen's Legacy, and made two maquettes of Steichen‚Äôs unfinished project, Shadblow, The Final Apprenticeship of Edward Steichen, Tice received a New Jersey State Council on the Arts Fellowship. His revised and expanded edition of Fields of Peace: A Pennsylvania German Album, was published by Godine in 1998. The Witkin Gallery closed in 1999, after thirty years of operation. Godine published George Tice: Selected Photographs, 1953-1999, a pocket-sized retrospective. His work was shown in American Photographs 1900/2000, Part 3, 1968-1999 at the James Danziger Gallery, New York. In 2000 Tice had his first showing at the Ariel Meyerowitz Gallery, New York. He then began photography for Paterson II. The following year Godine published a pocket-sized retrospective book with the same title as the show. Tice traveled to Verona to oversee production. George Tice: Urban Landscapes was published by W. W. Norton with introduction by Brian Wallis in 2002, accompanied by an exhibition of the same title at the International Center of Photography, New York. The show traveled to the New Jersey State Museum, Trenton, New Jersey and The Museum of Art, University of Maine, Bangor the following year, when he also exhibited at the Point Light Gallery, Sydney, New South Wales. In 2004 there were further shows at the Candace Perich Gallery, New York, and the Zelda Cheatle Gallery in London. That year Tice traveled to London, Yorkshire, and Belgium, where he oversaw production of Common Mementoes, a collection of previously unpublished urban landscapes from the 1990s. Five of his photographs were adapted for scenic drops and rear projections for the Broadway musical, Jersey Boys. Tice had an exhibition at the Scott Nichols Gallery in San Francisco, and he resumed work on the Tice genealogy and photography of Ticetown. In 2006 Tice traveled to Belgium to work with Georges Charlier of Amanasalto for the production of Paterson II. He supervised printing of a special edition of 20 x 24 platinum/palladium prints by Salto. Paterson II was published by Quantuck Lane Press with an essay by A. D. Coleman, \\"The Poetics of the Quotidian: George Tice's Paterson Photographs.\\" A related exhibition, Paterson II: Photographs by George Tice, opened at the Newark Museum, continuing on to Lambert‚Äôs Castle, Paterson, the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art, at the University of Oregon at Eugene. Tice contributed to the group show at the J. Paul Getty Museum, Where We Live, Photographs of America, from the Berman Collection. He then began to work on an inventory of his archive. In 2009 David R. Godine published Seacoast Maine, with an introduction by John K. Hanson. This was accompanied by an exhibition at the Peter Fetterman Gallery, Santa Monica. In 2010 filming began for a documentary about his career, George Tice: Seeing Beyond the Moment, by New Street Productions, premiered in 2013 at the Newark Museum as part of his seventy-fifth birthday celebrations, which included exhibitions at William Paterson University, The Newark Museum, the Scott Nichols Gallery, the Nailya Alexander Gallery, and the Point Light Gallery. In October 2015 the Lucie Foundation honored Tice with their Lucie Award for Lifetime Achievement at Carnegie Hall. Personal life George Tice married Joanna Blaylock in 1958, while he was serving in the U.S. Navy. A son, Christopher, was born. They divorced in 1960, following his discharge from the Navy. He met and married Marie Tremmel the same year. They had four daughters, Loretta, Lisa, Lynn, and Jennifer. Tice and Marie Tremmel were divorced in 1977. Married Galina Kirlenco, of Russian descent, in 1984, divorced in 1986. Response and recognition In 1965, Jacob Deschin, camera editor of the New York Times, wrote about Tices' joint show with Jules Aarons at the underground Gallery \\"George A. Tice portrays what he sees at its face value, with emphasis on technical precision and inventiveness.\\" (The New York Times, Apr 4, 1965) In 1966, Deschin wrote, \\"The tree silhouettes show a fresh phase of this talented photographer's exquisite ability to achieve almost an etcher's quality in his prints. A highly precise craftsman aware of every detail in his pictures, and where and how to place them in the completed image, Mr. Tice is that rare master of the medium who is also imbued with taste, perception and an acute responsiveness to the pictorial aspects of the world about him.\\" (The New York Times, Mar 20, 1966) In 1970, Gene Thornton wrote, \\"George A. Tice, currently showing silver and platinum prints at the Witkin Gallery, has stayed in one place and made a trip through time. I have never visited his region (he calls it the Pennsylvania German country) but I am charmed by his vision of a bucolic paradise that contains no automobiles [‚Ä¶] All are presented in beautiful controlled tones that range from the delicate pale greys and whites of winter landscapes to the rich blacks and gradually fading greys of two misty rural views.\\" (The New York Times, Jun 28, 1970) In 1972, Sanford Schwartz: [Paterson and Bob Adelman's Down Home]...represent more traditional documentary ways of treating life in America. Neither photographer's approach draws as complicated a response from the viewer as Erwitt's. Frank's or Arbus's. Tice's pictures of unlovely, corroding old Paterson show a remarkable blend of intimacy, affection and clear-sightedness. His attitude is different from that of anyone else working today: it recalls the authoritative, almost tragic objectivity and the unconsciously sought-for grandeur we see in Barnard's and Brady's views of Civil War battlefields and bombarded cities. (The New York Times, Dec. 3, 1972) In 1973, James R. Mellow, said, writing about Witkin's show of Tice and Hine, \\"The scenery is often expectable...but Tice approaches it with a matter-of-factness that is admirable. He never paints the lily. Yet he can take account of unexpected beauty: houses glimpsed through a rain-splattered window; an isolated frame house looming up in a fog at Jonesport, Me. And there are striking photos of the hardy types who live in the region‚Ä¶Tice's camera appears to be unobtrusive and modest to a fault. Yet the photographer has the knack of raising the ordinary to the level of the particular and the essential.' (The New York Times, Feb 24, 1973) Vivien Raynor, writing in The New York Times, said, \\"Finding precedents for Mr. Tice's photography is easier than defining the personal qualities that make it so special. As others have remarked, his tranquil towns, usually deserted, could sometimes be those of Walker Evans updated; his industrial views are not unrelated to Charles Sheeler's, and, for good measure, the stillness and silence of his compositions link him to Atget, the first great urban reporter. But the resemblances are superficial, and besides, artist though he is, Mr. Tice approaches his subjects with eyes and mind that have fed not upon art alone or, for that matter, photography. If there's a touch of surrealism in his pictures, it's the natural, homegrown thing visible any day on American streets and not derived from a school of painting. [...] Like D. H. Lawrence and George Orwell, Mr. Tice has lived in the scenery he depicts, which is probably why he plays it straight. Where other photographers might have seized on the men's clothing store in Trenton or the Esso station with tenements in Hoboken as symbols of banality, he approaches them on equal terms. There is neither satire not sentimentality in his art, only recognition and, perhaps, awareness of the awful loneliness attendant on the pursuit of happiness.\\" (The New York Times, Feb 10, 1980) In 1982, Andy Grundberg, said \\"At age 43, George Tice has had a career in photography spanning almost 30 years. [‚Ä¶] Along the way he has acquired a national reputation as a master photographic printmaker and become a leading practitioner and teacher of platinum/palladium printing, a process which in the last five years has gone from cult status to fad. The current retrospective of Tice's career at Witkin Gallery (41 East 57th Street, through Jan. 30) gives ample evidence that his reputation as a craftsman is well deserved. All of the 95 prints on view, whether they are on commercially prepared silver papers or more exotic, handmade emulsions, can be justly described as beautiful. At the same time, however, the exhibition gives evidence of a serious bifurcation in Tice's work, of which neither he nor his substantial following seems aware. There are, it would seem, two photographers at work here: one, a skeptical documenter of the urban environment; the other, a romantic and oftentimes sugary pictorialist. Tice's best work falls in the first category. Pictures like Car for Sale, Paterson, N.J. (1969), showing a pre-war apartment house, its crumbling driveway echoed by bare trees in a bare sky, and Petit's Mobil Station, Cherry Hill, N.J. (1974), a night view of a gas station in which a huge water tower looms darkly in the sky, have a bleak, hard-won beauty that enhances their value as documents of the texture of life in the Garden State. Tice has lived in New Jersey most of his life, and his perceptions of it are without peer. The other Tice - the maker of sweet and thoroughly conventionalized nature pictures of such things as lily pads and oak trees, the perpetrator of soft-focus, diffused photographs of young women and cats cannot compete with Tice the documentary photographer, yet he persists. [‚Ä¶] Besides presenting the two sides of Tice's work, the exhibition suggests that Tice himself is unaware of the division and thus remains unable to either adopt one style or achieve some sort of synthesis. Indeed, on examining the dates of his photographs, it is difficult to find much evidence of artistic development or maturation. Certainly his early photographs of the Pennsylvania Amish, while superficially at once documentary and pictorial, are less resolved than the later New Jersey views found in Tice's two best books, Paterson (1972) and Urban Landscapes (1975). [‚Ä¶] Water Tower, Middletown, N.J. (1980) appears to lead toward a resolution of Tice's split personality, since it combines the industrial subject matter of Petit's Mobil Station with a pictorialist printing style, but the style proves overbearing. We are left, then, with a portrait of an artist still struggling to define his world view - despite, or more likely because of, his virtuosic command of the medium's possibilities.\\" (The New York Times, Jan 3, 1982) In 1982, Shirley Homer said, \\"'Never before have the exquisite photographs of George A. Tice been printed in a book of such tremendous quality as this,' said Lee D. Witkin, owner of the Witkin Gallery at 41 East 57th Street in Manhattan, about Urban Romantic (David R. Godine, Boston, $50; deluxe limited edition, accompanied by an original print, $300). The book went on sale at the gallery last month. Mr. Tice, a resident of the Woodbridge Township community of Iselin, is a nationally acclaimed photographer who once more has revived the age-old debate of photography's relation to the arts. \\"However, so brillantly does Urban Romantic capture the majesty of the ordinary in photos like Charlie & Violet on Their Houseboat, Jersey City, N.J. (1979) and Car for Sale, Paterson, N.J. (1969) that for the reader, at least, the question is resolved.\\" (The New York Times, October 3, 1982) Awards *1964: Awarded The Frank Roy Fraprie Medal in the 32nd International photographic exhibition at the Boston Camera Club *1973: National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship; Guggenheim Fellowship; Grand Prix du Festival d'Arles *1987: Inducted into the New Jersey Literary Hall of Fame.

Honyman belonged to the generation that followed Shakespeare and Burbage. He was christened on 7 February 1613, in the parish of St. Botolph's, Bishopsgate. An apprentice of John Shank, he started his career as a boy player filling female roles; in his teens he was playing leading female parts, Domitilla in The Roman Actor (1626) and Sophia in The Picture (1629), both plays by Philip Massinger, and Clarinda in Lodowick Carlell's The Deserving Favourite (also 1629). Some boy actors of Honyman's era made successful transitions from filling lead female roles as boys to lead male roles as young men; Stephen Hammerton and Richard Sharpe are two examples of this successful transition. John Honyman illustrates the opposite phenomenon, in that he graduated to only rather minor roles as a young adult. He played the servingman Sly in John Clavell's The Soddered Citizen (1630), and the First Merchant in Massinger's Believe as You List (1631). In the 1632 King's Men's revival of John Fletcher's The Wild Goose Chase, he filled the minor part of \\"Young Man disguised as a Factor.\\" Honyman was made a Groom of the Chamber on 15 April 1633, along with John Thompson. His potential development in his craft was cut short by his early death. He was buried on 13 April 1636. His last will and testament, drawn up six days earlier on 7 April (Robert Benfield was one of the witnesses), leaves bequests to his mother, father, and brother, his fellow actors, and the poor of his parish, St. Giles without Cripplegate.G. E. Bentley, \\"Records of the Players in the Parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate,\\" Papers of the Modern Language Association Vol. 44 No. 3 (September 1929), pp. 789-826; see p. 809. Thomas Jordan published an elegy on Honyman in his Love's Dialact (1646). Honyman also appears to have been among the minority of actors who wrote one or more plays. Sir Aston Cockayne left a 10-line poem \\"To Mr. John Hunnieman\\" that extols his \\"Successful pen and fortunate fantasy\\" and even compares Honyman to Shakespeare. Yet nothing is known of Honyman's dramas, not even their titles.W. J. Lawrence, \\"John Honeyman, the Caroline Actor-Dramatist,\\" Review of English Studies Vol. 3 No. 10 (April 1927), pp. 220-2.

He is a Managing Member of CMASH, LLC, a member of the Management Committee of Starling VC, a Board Member of DeepMacro, and an owner of ConvexityWines.com. He serves on Corporate Development Committee and Advisory Board of Dean of School of Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Early life Huang received his B.A. in Economics from National Taiwan University in 1977 and Ph.D. in Financial economics from Stanford University in the United States in 1983. He was on the faculty of the MIT Sloan School of Management from 1983 to 1994, and was a full professor holding the J.C. Penney Professorship in Finance when he left MIT in the summer of 1994.  Career  Huang co-founded, with Myron Scholes, Platinum Grove Asset Management L.P. (PGAM), an investment management company based in Rye Brook, New York in 1999. He was the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of PGAM from 1999 to 2009, and served as Non-Executive Chairman from 2010 to 2013. See Myron Scholes #Investment activity. PGAM was one of the largest fixed income relative value focused hedge funds in the ten years Huang was its CEO and CIO. Before founding PGAM, Huang was with Long Term Capital Management L.P. from 1995 to 1999 and was a Partner and Co-Head of its Asia office in Tokyo from 1997 to 1999. Prior to that he was Head of Fixed Income Derivatives Research at Goldman, Sachs & Co. in New York from 1993 to 1994. He was an editor of Review of Financial Studies and an associate editor of Journal of Economic Theory, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, Mathematical Finance, and Journal of Mathematical Economics. He is the author of more than thirty articles and is co-author, with Robert H. Litzenberger, of Foundations for Financial Economics (Prentice Hall, 1988. .), a textbook for graduate students in financial markets. Research As an academic, his most extensive work has been in dynamic general equilibrium theory. Here he has developed two main themes. The first theme concerns the relations between the revelation of new information to the agents in an economy and the characteristics of asset prices in an economy. His results justified some key assumptions underlying much of the modern work on asset pricing. The second main theme concerns the critical allocational role of securities markets. Previous research suggested that an efficient allocation of resources would require markets for far more securities than actually exist. Huang's work shifted the focus of discussion from the number of markets to the nature of dynamic trading opportunities. He showed that an efficient allocation of resources could in fact be obtained with relatively few securities as long as these securities could be traded continuously. In his work on individual consumption and portfolio decisions, Huang provided a new approach to this classic economic topic. Many of the inherent dynamic optimization problems in this area had proved to be impossible to solve. Huang showed how these seemingly intractable problems can be broken into two easy-to-solve parts, one involving a static optimization problem and the other a dynamic problem without optimization. Huang's work on utility theory has allowed researchers to include in their models some intuitively appealing aspects of individual preferences that were previously ignored because they were too difficult to formalize. Additionally, he has expanded the applicability of auction theory to financial markets by studying price behavior in actions conducted by participants who are purchasing items for resale rather than for their own use.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has become the seventh largest law enforcement agency in the United States. Since 1996, it has also been the largest sheriff's department in the world.  Early history  Following the organization of the State of California into counties, the Sheriff's Department of Los Angeles County was formed in April, 1850. Elections for the office of Sheriff were held annually until 1882, when the term was increased to two years; in 1894 the term was increased to four years. The first Sheriff of Los Angeles County was George T. Burrill and his staff consisted of two Deputies. The Los Angeles Rangers (1852-1856) The local newspaper, Los Angeles Star, reported that in 1852, the Los Angeles Rangers were organized (since they assisted both the L.A. County Sheriff and the L.A. Town Marshal, they were the predecessors of both the L.A. County Sheriffs Department and of the Los Angeles Police Department). The Rangers were actually a California State Militia Company that acted as a posse, taking orders through their Captain from the office of the Sheriff. Combining both Mexican and American influences, mounted and uniformed, the Rangers formed a troop of 100 men. Their duties included pursuit of criminals or Indian raiders. The Southern California, another local newspaper of the time, remarked, \\"We are proud to think that the Los Angeles Rangers have the full confidence of our whole community.\\" The Los Angeles Star praised the Rangers as a step toward improving matters in the area. One of the Rangers, Major Horace Bell, later wrote, Reminiscences of a Ranger; or, Early times in Southern California, describing this organization and activities.  Flores Daniel Gang and Getman murder  In 1857, the outstanding crime was the murder of James Barton, Sheriff of Los Angeles County, and several members of this posse by members of the Flores Daniel Gang. Barton was killed only three weeks after he was elected to his second term. > On a tip, Sheriff Barton and his posse set out to capture a group of > bandits. They traveled south toward San Juan Capistrano. On the morning of > January 23, 1857, Barton and his posse encountered the bandits. In the > ensuing struggle, the Sheriff and all but two of his men were shot. Three of > the bandits were killed. Immediately after the funerals another posse gave > pursuit to the villains. In all, fifty-two bandits were captured, eleven > were hanged. They were hanged at Fort Hill - a rise of ground behind the > jail - where a temporary gallows had been constructed.\\" Fort Hill was > located north of Los Angeles and Aliso Streets. Ironically, shortly after being elected to replace Sheriff Barton, on January 7, 1858, Sheriff William C. Getman (once Lieutenant of the Rangers), was killed, after serving only seven days in office, while attempting to arrest a \\"maniac.\\" The incident was reported as follows: > The maniac was hiding at the Monte Pico, a pawn shop near Los Angeles and > Aliso Streets. There the Sheriff found the suspect locked and barricaded in > a room. While the Sheriff was endeavoring to force an entrance, the suspect > threw open the door, ran out and, to the dismay of all, pulled a pistol from > his pocket, discharged the weapon, and Sheriff Getman dropped on the spot. > The suspect then retreated into the pawn shop and fired at the crowd which > had gathered. A Deputy finally killed the desperado, but not before the > desperado fired twenty or thirty shots, four or five of which passed through > the Deputy's clothing. Chinese massacre of 1871 On Monday, October 25, 1871, a tong war among local Chinese resulted in the death of Robert Thompson, a white rancher. This would precipitate the Chinese massacre of 1871. A riot broke out immediately after Thompson's murder and a massacre of Chinese residents began. At least 17 to 20 Chinese were killed by the mob. Sheriff James Frank Burns addressed the crowd and persuaded everyone to peacefully disperse. Burns then formed a posse of 25 Deputies to maintain order in the community. The story of the massacre was heard around the world and the U.S. government made an official apology to China. Burns obtained 150 arrest warrants against known mob members and one by one arrested them.http://www.militarymuseum.org/LosAngelesRangers.html Modern history Twenty-four men have served Los Angeles County as Sheriff since 1850: nineteen were elected and six were appointed by the Board of Supervisors to serve the unexpired term of their predecessors. Two were killed in the line of duty. Of those appointed, four were re-elected to the office. 1870s to 1910s In 1871, William B. Rowland was sworn as sheriff in 1871 and was re-elected three times.

Nicknamed \\"Ober\\", he was born and raised in Davenport, Iowa, but he lived most of his adult life in Minnesota. Oberholtzer attended Harvard University and received a bachelor of arts degree, but left after one year of graduate study in landscape architecture. He made his first trip to the Minnesota-Ontario border lakes in 1906. In 1909 he took his first extended canoe voyage through the border lakes and the Rainy Lake watershed, traveling 3,000 miles that summer. During the period from 1908 to 1915, Oberholtzer wrote a number of articles and short stories, some under the penname Ernest Carliowa. Many of the stories and articles were based on his canoe trip experiences. In 1913, Oberholtzer moved to Rainy Lake. He purchased Mallard Island in 1922; the tiny island would be his home for more than 50 years. After plans were announced by business mogul Edward Backus to construct a series of dams to harness the Rainy Lake watershed for power generation, Oberholtzer spoke in opposition at a hearing of the International Joint Commission held at International Falls in September 1925. As a result of meetings with Minneapolis businessmen who were similarly opposed to industrialization of the area, the Quetico-Superior Council was formed in 1928. Oberholtzer served as its first president. His activities for the council included lobbying United States Congress and the Minnesota legislature, testifying before the International Joint Commission and building public support for the council's program. In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the President's Quetico-Superior Committee to advise and coordinate government activity concerning the Quetico-Superior area. Oberholtzer was its first chairman, and served as a member until 1968. Oberholtzer was one of the eight founding members of The Wilderness Society and served on its executive council from 1937 until 1967. His addition to The Wilderness Society lent national stature to the group.Sutter, p. 191 In addition to his wilderness campaigning, he spoke fluent Ojibwe and was a fervent student of their culture. He never married and died in 1977 after a long period of ill health. Oberholtzer is recognized today as a leading advocate for the preservation of the Quetico-Superior lake area,Sutter, p. 6 as well as an advocate of the Native American culture in that region. The Minneapolis Star Tribune selected Oberholtzer as one of the 100 Most Influential Minnesotans of the 20th century. Exhibition An exhibit of Oberholtzer's photographs was held at the Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art. The exhibit included images displaying his relationship with the Ojibwe and their lifestyle. One section of the exhibition detailed in photograph the process of harvesting and preparing wild rice.

It was first established as a soaring site in 1930, and is the home to hang gliding, paragliding, radio-controlled model sailplanes, and full-scale man- carrying sailplanes. It is listed as a National Landmark of Soaring of the National Soaring Museum, a San Diego City Historical Site (#315), and a Model Aviation Landmark of the Academy of Model Aeronautics (#1 in the nation). It is listed on the California Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places. It is considered by glider enthusiasts of all types to be the \\"Kitty Hawk of the West.\\" Full-scale sailplanes are operated by the Associated Glider Clubs of Southern California, only during special permit windows between February and April, while models, hang gliders, and paragliders fly any time the wind permits. The local Flight Director and Concessionaire maintains and enforces safety rules to protect both pilots and spectators. History The Torrey Pines cliffs have featured soaring aircraft since the 1930s, with many famous aviators earning their wings on the strong ocean breezes. Many aviation pioneers have flown at Torrey Pines. Charles A. Lindbergh flew along the coast from Mt. Soledad to Del Mar in a Bowlus sailplane on February 24, 1930. Anne Morrow Lindbergh, his wife and the first American woman to get a first-class glider license, also flew from here. In 1936, Woody Brown became the first person to launch from the top of the Torrey Pines cliff and come back to land at the same place. Other notables include Hawley Bowlus, Bud Perl, Bill Beuby, John Robinson, Dick Essery, Bill Ivans, Helen Dick, Richard Johnson, Bill Petre and Paul MacCready. During World War II, the gliderport and its surroundings were transformed into U.S. Army Camp Callan, an anti-aircraft artillery training facility. The site has been the location of several national and international soaring records since 1946. Location Located on the cliffs above Black's Beach, next to the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, the Torrey Pines Gliderport has views of the Pacific Ocean and the city of San Diego. Nearby are the Torrey Pines Municipal Golf Course, Torrey Pines State Beach, Torrey Pines State Reserve, Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of California, San Diego. The trail to the clothing optional Black's Beach begins on the cliffs just south of the gliderport.

This was the second class that was built on the Einheitslok principle. According to the first classification scheme of the DR's Standardisation Bureau, 2-10-0 goods train locomotives were to be procured with a 20-ton axle load. To achieve this a two-cylinder class (the Class 43) and a three-cylinder class (the Class 44) were envisaged, because it was not yet known which configuration would be more economical. Ten examples of each class were procured in parallel. The Class 43 was supplied by Henschel and by Schwartzkopff. In trials it was discovered that the Class 43 was more economical to operate at powers under 1500 PSi. As a result, a further 25 examples of the 43 were ordered up to 1928. However, due to the increase in goods train speeds in the 1930s, the Class 44 was given priority thereafter because, in addition to its economy when running at higher speeds and the better running qualities of its three-cylinder driving gear, it was also cleared for running at up to 80 km/h.Hans Wiegard: Fahrzeugportr√§t Baureihe 43: 5000 Tonnen am Haken, in Lok Magazin 8/2004, p.41 As a result, no more Class 43s were ordered. In the literature statements are often found that the locomotive was not sufficiently powerful overall. In response to that, number 43 013 was loaded for testing purposes with a train of 5000 tons - that is more than twice that given in the haulage tables - and headed it without complaint. In doing so, 43 013 is a record holder. Never before or since has any German locomotive hauled such a load. The Class 43s, which had operating numbers 43 001 - 43 035, all remained with the DR in East Germany after the Second World War. In 1960, the remaining engines were once again modernised, the powerful boiler even enabled goods trains greater than the maximum allowable load to be hauled. This led, however, to frame damage, that the Reichsbahn could not repair. So the machines were rapidly retired, the last one being taken out of service in 1968 at Cottbus locomotive depot. Locomotive 43 001 became a museum locomotive and belongs to the Dresden Transport Museum, but is in the Saxon Railway Museum, a former home depot of the Class 43. The engines of this class were equipped with a 2'2' T 32 tender.

Creation The strip was a collaboration between cartoonist Mark Watson (aka Marq) and Jeff MacDonald (aka Y!ph) and appeared infrequently in The Sheaf, the University of Saskatchewan students' newspaper. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/marq_yiph.htm Controversy=Background In the February 22, 2006, issue of The Sheaf, pages B1-B4 of the issue were devoted to several lengthy opinion articles and letters addressing the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy.Will Robbins, \\"Examining the issues behind the cartoon controversy\\" , The Sheaf, 23 February 2006 The Sheaf editor-in-chief, Will Robbins, wrote a 1,000-word editorial prefacing the other opinions outlining the reasons behind The Sheaf's editorial decision not to publish any of the controversial cartoons. Robbins also indicated that the decision not to publish any of the cartoons was not unanimous among the editorial staff. Indeed, in response to this decision The Sheaf news editor, Jeremy Warren, resigned from the paper. The nuanced journalistic position Robbins staked for The Sheaf was brought into question just one week later by the appearance of a controversial instalment of the Capitalist Piglet cartoon. The March 2 issue In the March 2, 2006, issue of The Sheaf, a two-panel installment of the comic strip appeared in the paper's \\"Comics and Humour\\" section depicting a caricature of Jesus performing fellatio on a top-hatted, monocle-wearing \\"Capitalist Piglet\\". The second panel includes the pig saying \\"It's Kosher if you don't swallow.\\"http://www.smalldeadanimals.com/archives/003630.html The comic had been scanned and laid-out into the newspaper's publication software by the graphics editor. The editor-in-chief reviewed the first draft of the paper and marked the Capitalist Piglet comic for deletion from the issue. It is in dispute whether or not he also verbally instructed the graphics editor to remove it or not; regardless the comic was not removed. The issue went through several more revisions before going to print without the offending comic being withdrawn. The editor-in-chief later claimed this was a mistake and due in part to a staff shortage (ostensibly aggravated by the above-mentioned resignation of the news editor).Jason Warick, \\"Sheaf cartoonist not sorry for uproar\\" , The StarPhoenix, 10 March 2006Chlo√© Fedio\\"U of S student paper on defensive after publishing Jesus comic\\" The Gateway/University of Alberta, 10 March 2006 In a retraction posted on page A2 of the March 9, 2006, issue, The Sheaf stated that Mark Watson was not an author of the March 2, 2006, Capitalist Piglet cartoon. In a letter appearing in that same issue, Mark Watson explained that his colleague, Y!ph, added his name to the installment \\"because he was using my character\\".Editorial staff, Editorial , The Sheaf, 9 March 2006 In the same issue, Jeff MacDonald accepted full responsibility for authoring the comic. Public reaction On March 3, 2006, University of Saskatchewan President Peter MacKinnon distributed an e-mail to all university staff and students calling on The Sheaf to apologize. The Saskatoon daily newspaper, The StarPhoenix, published several stories about the incident, beginning on March 11, 2006.Janet French, \\"Cartoon spurs anger\\" , The StarPhoenix, 7 March 2006Janet French, \\"Cartoons trip up Saskatoon student paper\\" , canada.com, 11 March 2006 Several Rawlco radio stations also picked up the story, in particular its Saskatchewan AM Radio Talk News stations CKOM and CJME. Morning talk-show personality, and former Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament, John Gormley, called on listeners to file a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission. The comic was reported by other media, including the local CTV station. It gathered national media attention as well, and was heavily debated on many blogs, including the popular Saskatchewan blog Small Dead Animals. \\"Freedom From Responsibility\\", Small Dead Animals, 6 March 2006 Canadian University Press also ran a wire story detailing the situation.Meredith Lilly, \\"Courting Controversy - Ezra Levant and the Danish cartoons Canadian Student Review, Spring 2006 Numerous letters, both supporting and attacking The Sheaf were published in its subsequent March 9, 2006, issue on pages A11-A15.Letters , The Sheaf, 9 March 2006 Actions by The Sheaf Shortly after the March 2 edition came out in print, the \\"Comics and Humour\\" section - including the offending comic - was removed from The Sheaf's online version.

It is published by the University of Illinois Press on behalf of the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship with funding from the Laura F. Willes Center for Book of Mormon Studies. History The journal was established in 1992 as a biannual publication of the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) at Brigham Young University (Provo, Utah). BYU is owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which teaches that the Book of Mormon is sacred scripture alongside the Bible. The journal was a venue for new scholarship from a faithful LDS perspective about Book of Mormon geography (Old World and New World), literary structures, name meanings, ongoing research, and other topics. The journal, along with FARMS, operated from the assumption that the Book of Mormon was historically ancient and divine scripture. According to American religious historian John-Charles Duffy, the journal took an approach of orthodox scholarship, without an emphasis on polemics or responding to critics of Mormonism.: \\"Work that assumes, but does not necessarily defend, LDS faith claims I prefer to call 'orthodox scholarship.' Henceforth, I will use the term apologetics to refer only to discourse that explicitly responds to criticisms of the faith. ... Orthodox scholarship is the most appropriate term for much of what appears in the Journal of Book of Mormon Studies (especially under John Sorenson's editorship)...\\" Since its beginning with FARMS, the journal was peer-reviewed, drawing mostly from internal reviewers. In 1998 the format changed from a plain academic journal style into a glossy magazine, intended to make its work more accessible to general LDS readers in addition to scholars. The journal was promoted to the public in 2003 when LDS Church public affairs referenced its recent articles in to answer problems of DNA and the Book of Mormon. The journal's publisher was changed in 2006 to the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship, which had absorbed FARMS. The journal was first published in 1992 under its current title. From 2009 to 2013 it was named Journal of the Book of Mormon and Restoration Scripture, returning to its original title in 2014. The journal had further changes in 2014, stemming from new directives from the Maxwell Institute. It went from biennial to annual, adopted an academic printing format, and announced a new mission within the larger field of religious studies for both \\"Mormon and non-Mormon scholars.\\" Abstracting and indexing The journal is abstracted and indexed in the ATLA Religion Database and EBSCO databases.

Costing $1.5 billion and covering an area of 380,000 square metres, the two main Harbour Towers were officially opened in May 2007. As a result of the Great Recession, the project suffered numerous delays for much of the next decade before construction finally resumed in 2016. Overview The commercial complex is located on the northern shoreline of Manama, adjacent to the King Faisal Highway which links Manama to Saudi Arabia via the King Fahd Causeway. The majority of the project, like the nearby Bahrain Bay, is being constructed on reclaimed land on the former site of the Manama pier. Construction of the Bahrain Financial Harbour started in 2003 and the two main Harbour Towers were completed in May 2007. However, construction of the rest of the project including the Bahrain Performance Centre, residential Diamond Tower and Villamar apartment buildings was delayed largely due to the Great Recession. The BFH project consists of multiple construction phases such as: Harbour Towers The two tallest twin-towers, Harbour Tower East and Harbour Tower West, are listed as the tallest completed towers in Bahrain, with a height of with 53 floors. The towers provide a total of 100,000 square metres of office space. Harbour Gate Also called Harbour Mall, it is a six-storey building that houses the Bahrain Stock Exchange and various investment firms. It has approximately 22,000 square metres of retail space and is connected to both Harbour Towers at the second floor. Villamar Towers The Villamar Towers are 3 residential skyscrapers located to the north of the Harbour Towers. The towers are 54, 43 and 52 storeys high and will boast 437 apartments, 52 villas, and 17 penthouses in addition to a health club and restaurants. With a cost of $650 million, construction began in 2006 and was originally scheduled to be completed by 2009. However, repeated delays saw the project being put on hold in October 2011 due to the Bahrain uprising, the global financial crisis, and a liquidity problem at the parent company, Gulf Holding Company. Construction briefly restarted in 2012 when it was estimated to have been halfway done before construction ceased again. The Bahraini government in 2015 formed a committee to oversee stalled projects in the country. In 2016, Gulf Finance House Financial Group announced that work on the towers would recommence in the same year. Harbour Row The project consists of a row of luxury homes alongside a commercial waterfront promenade. Construction of the $150 million project started in 2016 after its building permit was issued.

He became seriously ill in 1870, possibly from dysentery, and thereafter he would suffer health problems for the remainder of his life. In 1872 he joined the Royal Polytechnic School in Stuttgart, Germany, where he studied civil engineering, graduating in 1876. While at school, however, he gained an interest in astronomy and decided to make that his life's work. After graduation, he spent four years working at the Observatory of Strasbourg. In 1880 he was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Strasbourg, with a dissertation on the parallax of Alpha Centauri.  Career = Heliometric observations  A year before Elkin left Strassburg, he had a meeting with the directory of the Cape Observatory, David Gill. The two men became fast friends and Gill extended Elkin an invitation to Cape Town. Dr. Elkin sailed for South Africa in December, 1880, arriving in 1881. While at the observatory, Gill and Elkin collaborated to measure stellar parallaxes of first magnitude stars using a heliometer. In 1884, H. A. Newton invited Elkin to become \\"Astronomer in Charge of the Heliometer\\" at the Yale University Observatory. Elkin succeeded Newton as the observatory director in 1896. Elkin first used the Yale Heliometer to make measurements of the Pleiades and later a survey of northern stars. Working with Frederick L. Chase and Mason Smith, the heliometer was used to undertake a survey which identified 238 parallaxes. These efforts were noted for their particular accuracy, at least for that time period, and elimination of systematic errors by Frank Schlesinger.  Meteor photography  Elkin is also recognized as a pioneer of meteor photography and between 1894 and 1910 he captured photographs of around 130 meteor trails. Using two groups of cameras with rotating shutters, an idea first suggested by Jonathan Homer Lane, he was the first to accurately determine meteor velocities.  Personal life  In 1896 he married Catharine Adams in New Haven. Due to ill health he retired at age 55, but lived until May 30, 1933. During his retirement he pursued music, photography, reading, and car mechanics.

Contact is allowed in UK stock car racing, that is, if you are unable to pass an opponent using speed alone, you are allowed to push or hit your opponent in order to pass. The degree of contact allowed varies between categories. History Stock car racing was brought to Britain in 1954. Taking place on existing greyhound or speedway tracks, the cars were mostly road cars from the 1930s with locked rear axle differentials and added armour for contact racing. After the first couple of years custom-built cars began to appear eventually making the 'stock' car name something of a misnomer. Since the early days of stock car racing in Britain the sport has developed into many different classes. In addition, non-contact oval racing became known as Hot Rods, while the original kind of armoured road car used in the 1950s developed into saloon stock cars and unarmoured cars raced in full contact banger racing. Stock car formulas Stock car formulas are largely split into two organisations broadly based in the north and south, BriSCA and Spedeworth. BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars is the most sophisticated stock car formula, with a race-tuned V8 engine developing 650 bhp, quick-change axles and gearboxes and staggered chassis and braking setups for constant left turning. Large bumpers are mandatory and contact is encouraged to remove opponents. Smaller BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars, previously known as 'Junior Stock Cars', is also very popular. A downsized version of the Formula 1 Stock Car, these cars are powered by a 2-litre Ford engine. V8 Hotstox is a third BriSCA formula that uses the Rover V8 engine. Licensed and promoted by Spedeworth are Spedeworth Superstox. Superstox are similar to BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars with the main visual difference being a smaller wing on the roof. These cars are also powered by the 2-litre Ford Pinto engine. Spedeworth V8 Stock Cars are similar to BriSCA Hotstox and use small-block 5-litre Chevrolet engines. Stoxkarts are the smallest and probably the cheapest formula, running 13 hp Honda engines. This formula is one of the only where more than one driver can use the same car in the same meeting. Also at the budget end of the racing spectrum is the rapidly growing Modstox formula. Visually similar to Formula 2 and Superstox, the formula is limited to the 850cc Reliant engine with other prescribed budget components, making it an ideal starter or \\"last chance\\" formula! Rebels are a one-make purpose built formula also using the 850cc reliant engine in slightly modified form, in steel chassis with \\"retro\\" plastic panels designed to give the look of a scaled down post-war Ford Popular. Another form of UK stock car racing is 2 Litre National Saloon Stock Cars, regulated by the Saloon Stock Car Association. This formula is typically based on heavily armoured Ford Sierra, Ford Mondeo and Vauxhall Vectra cars purposely reconstructed for this full contact class. Other similar formulas are 1300cc Stock Cars and Ministox. Together with the Ministox, there are several formulae that cater for juniors (under 16 years old) being Junior Stoxkarts, Junior Bangers, Junior Rods, Jascars, Ninja Karts and Micro F2 allow youngsters to compete in a controlled environment (although Stoxkarts can be shared by two drivers at the same meeting with one racing in the juniors the other in the seniors). Hot Rods Hot Rods are a non-contact formula where the vehicles are based on road cars, or resemble road cars. The concept for the National series is similar to that of NASCAR. The NHRPA cars resemble production cars, but are in fact purpose built space frame chassis with a Kevlar body which mimics a production car. Other Hot Rod categories do make use of standard production body/chassis. Classes include;- National Hot Rods, 2 litre Hot Rods, Stock Rods, Lightning Rods, Rookie Rods, Junior Rods, MASCAR Other non-contact categories which might be included as Hot Rod classes are Legends, Midgets Bangers Bangers are production cars that are raced with modifications for safety such as reinforced drivers' doors, H-Frame Roll Cages added and all glass removed. The racing can be either Full Contact or Limited Contact. Full Contact is when wrecking usually takes more importance than the racing with drivers some times having head on crashes to take out opponents. Limited Contact on the other hand only allows some lighter crashing and spinning of cars with the racing aspect still being a key focal point. That said, this sport is not a Destruction Derby, although some banger meetings do end with one.

He played for the Rockford Forest Citys, New York Mutuals, Philadelphia White Stockings, Louisville Grays, Buffalo Bisons, Cincinnati Red Stockings, and St. Louis Browns. His brother, Washington Fulmer, also played a single game at the major league level. Early life Fulmer was born in Philadelphia, and he came from a family of soldiers. His father Michael was a major in the Union Army before becoming a butcher in Philadelphia. Fulmer's grandfather John fought in the American Revolution, and his great-grandfather Michael was involved in the French and Indian War. Fulmer tried to serve in the Civil War himself by joining the Southwark Guards, but he was 14 years old and he was sent home before he saw any battle. Career Fulmer made his major league debut for the Rockford Forest Citys in 1871, the first year that games were played in the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players. He played for the league's New York Mutuals in 1872 before moving on to a three-year stint with the Philadelphia White Stockings. He claimed that he executed the first major league unassisted triple play in 1873, but MLB lists the first one as being earned by another player in 1909. The league folded after the 1875 season. In 1876, Fulmer received his only opportunity to manage at the major league level; he was a player-manager for the Louisville Grays in the first year of the National League's existence. The team finished 30-36. He played in the minor leagues for a couple of seasons before his Buffalo Bisons were admitted to the National League in 1879. He stayed with Buffalo in 1880, but he struggled to hit and he did not play much. Before the 1881 season, there was talk that Fulmer would be signed by the Detroit Wolverines, but manager Frank Bancroft ultimately signed another player to fill his infield needs. Fulmer decided to sit out of baseball for a year, becoming the manager of a traveling theater troupe that staged productions of Uncle Tom's Cabin. He returned to baseball for three years in the American Association, playing with teams in Cincinnati and St. Louis. His last professional playing appearances were in 1885 with an independent team in Portland, Maine. Later life Fulmer came back to Philadelphia after his baseball career was over and he stayed there for the rest of his life. He worked as a magistrate, despite not having a college education or legal training. Later, he was a doorman for the Curtis Publishing Company in the Center City district. Fulmer suffered a stroke in the late 1930s and he died in 1940. He was interred at Fernwood Cemetery in Fernwood, Pennsylvania. He was survived by his wife, Annie; they had married 65 years earlier.

The company is probably best known for its \\"Bowie\\" style hunting knives. The company was purchased by Coleman (the famous manufacturer of outdoor equipment) in 1984. Camillus Cutlery Company purchased Western in 1992. In February, 2007, Camillus closed as a result of bankruptcy due to competition from companies making cheaper knives in other countries. The Western brand and Camillus brand are now owned by the Acme United Corporation and manufactured in Asia. Western Cutlery Company The Western Cutlery Company story and that of several other manufacturers could begin in 1864, the year that Charles W. Platts emigrated from Sheffield, England. Platts was descended from a long line of knife makers and, in turn, his descendants were to have a significant impact upon a number of U.S. cutlery businesses. Platts' first employment in this country was the American Knife Company in Reynolds Bridge, Connecticut. A few years later, he became superintendent of the factory belonging to the Northfield Knife Company in the nearby town from which the company took its name. Charles and his wife, Sarah, reared five sons and each learned the cutlery craft at the Northfield Cutlery firm. Although other sons and their descendants remained active in the cutlery industry, the focus here is on Harvey Nixon Platts. H.N. Platts left Northfield in 1891 and moved west to Little Valley, in Cattaraugus County, New York. His experience led him to work in the blade grinding and finishing department of a new knife factory operated by Cattaraugus Cutlery Company. The company's early owners, J.B.F. Champlin and his son Tint, were joined temporarily in the business by four brothers of Mrs. Champlin (formerly Therese Case). These Champlin brothers-in-law were W.R., Jean, John and Andrew Case. Also working in the Cattaraugus office was Debbie Case, who lived with her brother, Russ, and their father, W.R. Case. In 1892, H.N. Platts and Debbie Case were married and, within a couple of years, they had become parents of two sons, Harlow and Reginald. Charles Platts, still a respected cutlery leader, and his other sons reentered the picture when they moved from Northfield to Little Valley in 1893 and began work with Cattaraugus. Practically every department of the Cattaraugus factory now had a Platts family member at work and the result would be nearly inevitable; they decided to start their own cutlery business. In 1896, Charles Platts was joined by his five sons in forming the C. Platts & Sons Cutlery Company in nearby Gowanda, New York, which in 1887 moved to new and larger facilities in Eldred, Pennsylvania. In 1900, when Charles Platts died, it was H.N. who assumed leadership of the family business. In addition to managerial responsibilities, H.N. served as the key salesman of Platts cutlery products. Ever expanding to new territories, his sales trips took him father west through several states and into the midwestern plains states. More than a few of Platts' sales trips were made in the company of another cutlery salesman, brother-in-law Russ Case. Platts would sell knives on one side of the town street while Case sold on the other side, each selling knives branded with their own name. A new company, with J. Russell Case and H.N. Platts as organizers and major stockholders, was to emerge from this family and working relationship. The early days of the business would see the company selling knives branded both \\"Platts\\" and \\"Case\\", so choosing one family name was deemed logical. Because Russ Case would have sales responsibility while Platts would oversee manufacturing, the name \\"Case\\" was selected. Some time earlier, Russ had begun a jobbing company known as \\"W.R. Case and Sons\\". The new company, incorporated in 1904 in Little Valley, would have a similar name except that an \\"s\\" would be added to the word \\"Son\\", thereby recognizing Platts family membership as the W.R. Case son-in-law. Debbie Case Platts supervised the office and summer school vacations saw the two young Platts boys working in the factory. H.N. Platts health began to decline due to \\"grinder's consumption\\", a disease of the lungs caused from years of work with the sandstone grinding wheels. Although the business was doing very well and the now teenage Platts sons were becoming increasingly active in the business, the father's health hinged upon a move to a drier climate. In 1911, he sold his interest in the company to Russ Case and moved his family to Boulder, Colorado. Accompanying Platts and his family to their new home was a determination to continue his lifetime work in the cutlery industry. A developing west proved to be fertile ground for knife sales since the cowboys, farmers, miners, and others workers needed quality cutlery to use many times every day. Platts knew the business and he certainly had experience in starting a cutlery factory, but he also recognized the need to establish a base of business if he was to be successful in starting all over again. His connections with the eastern cutlery manufacturers were important as he sought sources of product. Before the year 1911 was over, orders were being sold and knives were arriving from the east to fill them. The new business was named ‚ÄúWestern States Cutlery and Manufacturing Company‚Äù. That name was selected instead of the founders name because \\"Platts\\" had been used a brand for the old company mentioned earlier and had very recently been used by Platts Brothers Cutlery Company, operated by H. N. Platts brothers. The geographical name was given to establish an identity separate from that of the Case and Platts businesses back east, and the ‚ÄúStates‚Äù extension of the name signified the company's sales territory. Early Western States knives were manufactured by Challenge, New York Knife Company, Valley Forge, Utica, and W. R. Case & Sons, among others. Although the business was prospering and a manufacturing facility would have been in order, it would be several years coming. World War I had begun and had brought shortages of material and labor. It had also required the services of the older son, Harlow, whose aid would have been needed for factory startup. Platts dream was realized, however, with the opening of his new factory in 1920. In the early 1940s, H. N. retired from active management of Western States Cutlery and those responsibilities were passed on to his sons, Reginald and Harlow, who continued in partnership until Reginald left the cutlery business in 1950. A new name, Western Cutlery Company, was given the business in 1951 when Harlow Platts and his son, Harvey, reincorporated the company. Western Cutlery remained in Boulder until its 1978 relocation to nearby Longmont, Colorado. Harvey Platts had become company president and continued in that capacity until 1984, when Western was purchased by the Crossman Air gun division of Coleman Corporation, thus ending the more than 100-year involvement of the Platts family in the U.S. cutlery industry. The association with Coleman lasted until 1990, when an investor group in Wyoming purchased the knife factory and trademarks. Unable to obtain satisfactory profit performance, the company's brands, machinery, and tooling were sold to Camillus Cutlery Co. in 1991, and many parts, papers, and other items were dispersed at auction. Camillus Cutlery closed its doors in February 2007, leaving the future of Western Cutlery and the company's other brands in limbo. Stampings and trademarks Early Western States knives had tangs stamped with the words WESTERN STATES in an arch and BOULDER, COLORADO in a straight line below, similar to the stamp used by C. Platts and Sons. Pocketknife tangs were stamped with the curved WESTERN STATES until about 1950, when WESTERN, BOULDER, COLORADO was adapted. WESTACO was a budget price 88 bd brand that seems to have appeared in the 1930s. WESTMARK was a brand used on high end products that first appeared in 1970. In addition to stamped tangs, many early knives had trademark etching on the blade. The company's best-known mark was a tic-tac-toe pattern, and the words ‚ÄúSharp Tested Temper‚Äù, were used beginning in 1911. In 1928, the Buffalo trademark consisting of an old buffalo skull framed with ‚ÄúWestern States‚Äù and ‚ÄúSharp Cutlery‚Äù was adopted and gradually replaced the tic-tac-toe marking. The ‚Äúdagger and diamond‚Äù logo that appeared on later Western products was first used in 1963. Tang stamps on pocketknives as well as sheath knives were gradually changed to ‚ÄúWestern USA‚Äù during the 1960s. Beginning in 1978 and continuing until the mid-1980s, the stamp ‚ÄúWestern USA‚Äù was used with a letter added beneath the ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù to indicate the production year. A-1977 B-1978 C-1979 D-1980 E-1981 F-1982 G-1983 H-1984 I-1985 J-1986 During the 1980s, stampings began to include the model number, a trend that continued under Camilluss ownership. The Coleman era (1984-1990) saw the use of some COLEMAN WESTERN stamps as well as ColemanWestern markings on the retaining strap buttons of knife sheaths. IDENTIFYING WESTERN STATES POCKETKNIVES Western States early knives follow the traditional numbering system of a pattern number, along with letters and other numbers that described the knife's features. Unfortunately, the numbering system was an internal protocol for employees and pattern numbers were not marked on the company's products until 1954. With Camillus now out of business, much of that inside company information has been lost. Collectors today must identify early knives from catalogs and application of the numbering system. Most of the old stock numbers can be deciphered by using the numbering key explained below. Some older pocketknife numbers have a zero inserted just before the pattern number to signify a modification, usually in material or finish, such as (9393 or 93093) The first digit signifies handle material as follows: * 2 ‚Äì imitation pearl * 3 ‚Äì brown or golden shell * 4 ‚Äì white or imitation ivory * 5 ‚Äì genuine stag * 6 ‚Äì bone stag * 7 ‚Äì ivory or agate * 8 ‚Äì genuine pearl References * Knife manufacturing companies Companies based in Boulder, Colorado Manufacturing companies established in 1898 1898 establishments in Colorado ","title":"Western Knife Company"},{"id":"18636792","text":"Sylvie Tellier, (born 28 May 1978, in Nantes, Loire-Atlantique) is a French model, beauty queen and the National Director of Miss France.

Also, the house was the last residence of Joseph Desha, the ninth governor of Kentucky. The property was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on December 2, 1974. History In 1784, Elijah Craig established the town of Lebanon, Virginia near McClelland's Station, an abandoned army fort. The name was changed to George Town in 1790 as a tribute to the first President of the United States, George Washington. The town was centered around Royal Spring, a large spring that was reliable source of water for the residents and industry in the area. The Payne-Desha House was built on the west side of Royal Spring Branch on land originally owned by Elijah Craig. After Craig's death in 1808, General Richard Gano and Josiah Pitts purchased the property near Royal Spring Branch from Craig's estate. In 1814 General John Payne bought both pieces of land making a estate. Payne's son Robert and daughter-in-law Maria (Williams) built a large stone house on the property. Financial circumstances forced the sale of the estate in 1821 and Benjamen Smith bought the property. Joseph Desha During the later years of his life, former Kentucky Governor Joseph Desha and his wife Margaret relocated to Georgetown. The couple first resided on East Main Street, then in 1841 moved to the property along Royal Spring Branch. Desha lived in the Payne-Desha House until his death on October 11, 1842. James Y. Kelly owned the property in the later part of the 19th century when extensive changes were made to the exterior of the house. Another longtime resident of the house was James R. Hamilton, who remodeled the structure in 1955 and 1975. Architecture Originally, the Payne-Desha House was built in the Federal style, and in the late 19th century the structure was updated to the then popular Italianate style. Additionally, the house underwent renovations in 1955 and 1975. Details of Italianate style porch addition As first built, the Payne-Desha house featured \\"an arch spanned central hall, a winding staircase, ash floors, sunburst design mantels, beaded and fluted woodwork, three basements, and a hipped roof\\" making the stone building one of the most intricate early stone structures in Scott County, Kentucky. The exterior of the house was altered in the late 19th century with the addition of Italianate style porches, hoodmolds, and roofbrackets.

These two churches shared the same origin dating back to the 19th century when Britain took over the Cape Colony. Their distinctive characters were that the Presbyterian Church in Southern Africa was constituted among soldiers and settlers who arrived in the Cape in 1820, spreading North into Zimbabwe and Zambia. The Reformed Presbyterian Church on the other hand was a product of Scottish missions intended for the indigenous Africans, which started at Lovedale Mission in Alice. It became autonomous in 1923. In 1896 the first Presbyterian congregation was founded in Rhodesia at Bulawayo, and later in 1903 in Salisbury (now Harare). Now there are 2 Presbyteries in Matabeland and Mashonaland.

It is part of the grounds not open to the public. However, it can be viewed from the two adjoining streets, as a result of Edward Middleton Barry, who also assisted with its landscaping, having used railings rather than walls or fencing in its design. The yard has existed since about the year 1100, but was greatly reduced in the 18th century to allow for the construction of new streets and buildings, the most notable of which is the wing taking up the eastern end and having the most prominent tower of the current palace. Speaker's Green fronts the Thames. An underground car park used by Members of Parliament is beneath. Before latest incarnations of the palace, the yard was an open public space used diversely such as for speeches, tournaments, pilloryings, and executions. It has twice been the scene of terrorist attacks. Location Arcade along the east side of New Palace Yard New Palace Yard takes up the north-west corner of the grounds of the Palace of Westminster. It is bordered to the north by Bridge Street, to the east by the Palace's North Front and Big Ben, to the south by Westminster Hall and to the west by Parliament Square. It is accessed from Parliament Square via the Carriage Gates. Underneath the yard is a five-level underground car park with 450 spaces for the cars of Members of Parliament, built from 1972 to 1974 for ¬£2.5 million (). Westminster Hall's north end is accessed via the yard, which is also the site of the Members' Entrance to the House of Commons. A public arcade along the Westminster Bridge side of Speaker's Green descends to a walkway under Bridge Street connecting Westminster tube station and Westminster Pier beneath the Victoria Embankment. Description The Jubilee Fountain in New Palace Yard The yard is laid out as a garden with a formal avenue of lime trees, benches of Portland stone and a central lawn surrounded by an oval roadway. Around the outside are a number of old catalpa trees. A fountain in the central lawn was installed in 1977 to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II and recalls the lost medieval fountain of Henry VI. The fountain stands in an octagonal pool in the centre of which is a large welded steel sculpture by Walenty Pytel. The sculpture is decorated with depictions of birds and beasts from six continents and is surmounted by a gilded crown. History The name of New Palace Yard refers to the first Palace of Westminster, built by the Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Confessor around 1050. The yard was created after William II of England constructed Westminster Hall in 1097 and was given the appellation \\"New\\" to distinguish it from Old Palace Yard a few hundred metres further south. For several hundred years, it was probably a patch of low-lying open marshy ground or perhaps even an inlet, prone to flooding up to very recent times. A rapid increase in the level of the Thames necessitated the construction of a river wall on the yard's eastern side in the 12th century. It was reclaimed by laying down cobbles on successive layers of debris that had accumulated over the years and was laid out as an open space by the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century. Thereafter, as Westminster grew, the yard came to be surrounded by buildings and walls. The yard's function in relation to the Palace of Westminster was similar to that of an outer bailey in a castle. It was one of three yards in the palace: New Palace Yard was the outer ward, a large open space which the general populace could access; the Green Yard was the middle ward, where the royal administration and the great offices of state were located; and Old Palace Yard was the inner ward, where the royal apartments were located. The interior of the yard was dominated for centuries by a large cupola-topped fountain built by Henry VI in 1443, which stood until the late 17th century. According to the 16th century historian John Stow, the fountain, which was known as the Great Conduit, was made to run with wine to mark coronations and other great state events. The remains of the fountain were rediscovered in the 1970s during the construction of the underground car park. Several executions and mutilations took place there: in 1580 the Puritan attorney John Stubbs and his servant William Page both had their hands cut off as punishment for libelling Queen Elizabeth I, while in 1612 the Scottish nobleman Robert Crichton, 8th Lord Crichton of Sanquhar, was hanged in the yard for murder. Lesser criminals were publicly exposed in a pillory erected on the site. Two such were the pretender Perkin Warbeck, pilloried in 1498, and Titus Oates, pilloried there during the reign of King James II for the Popish Plot. The last person to be pilloried in the yard was John Williams, the publisher of The North Briton newspaper in 1765. Tournaments and royal festivities were also staged there. On one occasion, when Catherine of Aragon married Arthur, Prince of Wales in 1501, a grand tournament was held in New Palace Yard. A stand was erected for the King on the south side of the yard and challengers exited Westminster Hall on horseback. They proceeded into the yard accompanied by a pageant-car which was drawn by four animals and carried a \\"fair young lady\\" on \\"a goodly chair of cloth of gold\\". Jousting is last recorded to have taken place in the yard in 1547 when Edward VI was crowned. Changes to the layout of New Palace Yard New Palace Yard was originally much larger than it is today. An etching by Wenceslaus Hollar, published in 1647, shows the area as an enclosed rectangle with houses flanking Westminster Hall on both sides, Henry VI's fountain and stands for coaches in the centre, a row of shops, taverns and coffee-houses on the north side and a large square gatehouse on the west side giving access to King Street, built by Henry VIII in 1532 and demolished in 1723. The gatehouse was built by Richard III and stood until 1707. A tower to the north side was built under Edward I and was demolished in 1715; it housed the bell known as Great Tom. Many of the buildings around New Palace Yard were swept away in the 1750s by the urban redevelopment that accompanied the construction of Westminster Bridge. Bridge Street was built to the north of the yard, Parliament Street to connect the Palace with Charing Cross, and Abingdon Street to connect it with Millbank. A row of buildings separated the yard from Bridge Street until they were demolished in 1866‚Äì7, opening up the yard to public view.

It provided a site for public meetings such as the September 1838 rally in support of the People's Charter. Public access to New Palace Yard was restricted from 1866 after a demonstration held in Hyde Park for parliamentary reform turned violent. Edward Barry was commissioned to enclose the yard with railings standing high, which were completed by February 1868. The works entailed major changes to the fabric of the yard, the surface of which was lowered by as much as in places. The yard was occasionally opened to the public to attend public speeches by the likes of William Ewart Gladstone, but is now treated as a secure area, closed to the public. Terrorist attacks New Palace Yard has twice been the scene of terrorist attacks. On 31 March 1979, an Irish National Liberation Army car bomb killed MP Airey Neave as he exited the underground car park at New Palace Yard. On 22 March 2017, a British terrorist crashed a car into the perimeter fence of the Palace grounds, after driving into pedestrians on the Westminster Bridge. After abandoning the vehicle, he ran into the New Palace Yard and fatally stabbed PC Keith Palmer, an unarmed police officer guarding the Carriage Gates. He was then shot by an armed close protection officer and died at the scene.

It lies between the Palace of Westminster to its north and east and Westminster Abbey to its west. It is known as the site of executions, including those of Sir Walter Raleigh, Guy Fawkes and other conspirators of the Gunpowder Plot, and James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton, following the Battle of Preston. St Margaret Street / Abingdon Street divides Old Palace Yard into two parts, running diagonally from the north-west to the south-east. The eastern, larger part belongs to the grounds of the Palace of Westminster, the seat of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. To the north of the Yard is St Stephen's Entrance, the public entrance into the Palace, as well as the great South Window of Westminster Hall. Standing near this window and facing away from it is a bronze equestrian statue of Richard Coeur de Lion (King Richard I, also known as \\"Richard the Lionheart\\"). Created by Baron Carlo Marochetti, the statue was completed in 1856 and installed in its present location in 1860. The eastern side of Old Palace Yard is defined by the West Front of the Palace, which is part of the precincts of the House of Lords; the carriage porch of the Peers' Entrance marks the middle of this frontage, and the Victoria Tower its southern end. Access to this part of Old Palace Yard is restricted for security reasons by means of concrete barriers. For most of the year it is used as a car park for the House of Lords, but it is cleared of barriers and street furniture for the annual State Opening of Parliament, the formal opening of the legislative session by the British monarch. Conveyed from Buckingham Palace to Parliament in a horse-drawn carriage, the monarch passes through the Yard en route to the Sovereign's Entrance, at the foot of the Victoria Tower. The western part of Old Palace Yard is freely accessible to the public. To its west are located the Henry VII Chapel and the Chapter House of Westminster Abbey, while to its south stands 6‚Äì7 Old Palace Yard, the sole survivor of the row of houses that used to surround the Yard. The building is now part of the Parliamentary Estate. Close by is a statue of King George V, made of Portland stone; sculpted by Sir William Reid Dick and unveiled in 1947, it stands on a pedestal by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and faces the Peers' Entrance of the Palace of Westminster. In 2002 an analemmatic sundial was fitted into the Yard's pavement in front of the statue, as a gift to Queen Elizabeth II from Parliament on the occasion of her Golden Jubilee.

A right-hander, Wainhouse was primarily a middle reliever. Amateur career Wainhouse attended Mercer Island High School in Mercer Island, Washington, where he played varsity baseball in his senior year. He attended college at Washington State, where he joined the baseball squad as a walk-on. Wainhouse had a strong season in his junior year, finishing with a 7‚Äì0 record. The Montreal Expos selected Wainhouse with their first-round pick of the 1988 Major League Baseball Draft, making him the first Canadian-born player picked the first round as well as the highest-ever pick out of Washington State. Later that summer, prior to making his professional debut, Wainhouse was named to the Canada's Olympic baseball team. At the Seoul Games, baseball was a demonstration event. Canada finished the preliminary round with a 1‚Äì2 record and failed to qualify for the medal round. Professional career Wainhouse made his pro debut in with the West Palm Beach Expos of the Single-A Florida State League. He progressed rapidly through the Expos farm system, earning a promotion to the Jacksonville Expos of the Double-A Southern League in . The season saw Wainhouse start with the Harrisburg Senators of the Double-A Eastern League, get promoted to the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians and, as a September call-up, see a two-game stint in Montreal. While playing with Indianapolis in , Wainhouse suffered a knee injury that put him on the disabled list for the remainder of the season. That offseason, the Expos traded him to the Seattle Mariners (along with Kevin Foster) for Frank Bolick and a player to be named later. He only appeared in three games for the Mariners at the start of the season before getting demoted to the minors. A back injury kept Wainhouse out of action in . He spent the following season in the minor league systems of the Toronto Blue Jays and Florida Marlins, failing to return to the majors until , with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He split time in and between the Pirates and their Triple-A affiliate, the Calgary Cannons. At the end of the 1997 campaign, Wainhouse signed with the Colorado Rockies.

Gonzalez's treatments are based on the belief that pancreatic enzymes are the body's main defense against cancer and can be used as a cancer treatment. His methods have been generally rejected by the medical community. and he has been characterized as a quack and fraud by other doctors and health fraud watchdog groups. In 1994 Gonzalez was reprimanded and placed on two years' probation by the New York state medical board for \\"departing from accepted practice\\". In one non-randomized clinical trial of terminally ill patients with pancreatic cancer, the Gonzalez-treated patients were found to have died much earlier than those treated with conventional chemotherapy. A better quality of life was reported by the chemotherapy arm. Biography Gonzalez was born December 28, 1947 in Flushing, New York. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude from Brown University, with a degree in English literature. From 1970‚Äì1977, Gonzalez worked as a journalist for Time Inc. and as a freelance writer, covering a variety of health-related topics, including a July 1972 cover story in New York Magazine, a 1976 cover story for Family Health Magazine, and an article for Prevention Magazine. Gonzalez became interested in medical research, cancer research in particular, while covering these topics. Gonzalez completed postgraduate premedical work at Columbia University and received his medical degree from Cornell University in 1983. Gonzalez worked with Robert A. Good at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center while in medical school. After receiving his medical degree, Gonzalez completed an internship in internal medicine at Vanderbilt University. From 1984-1986, Gonzalez worked with Good again, completing a fellowship in immunology while at University of Oklahoma and All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida. Gonzalez died on July 21, 2015 at age 67. Cancer treatment and its effectiveness Gonzalez's treatment methods, which he's been using since 1987, are developed from previous work by the orthodontist William Donald Kelley. Gonzalez believes that cancer is caused by a poor diet, a problem compounded when one does not eat a diet that corresponds with one's metabolic type; and environmental pollution and daily stress only contribute to health problems. The Gonzalez regimen proposes as a treatment a cure-oriented change in life style and nutrition, the use of oral pancreatic enzymes, large numbers of dietary supplements (up to 150 pills per day) and twice daily coffee enemas. According to the National Cancer Institute, which co-sponsored with the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine a clinical trial on Gonzalez's treatments produced \\"limited and inconclusive\\" results regarding the efficacy of the Gonzalez Regimen as a treatment for cancer. In 1999 Gonzalez published an article describing prolonged life in a small group of patients with pancreatic cancer in the peer-reviewed journal Nutrition and Cancer. Subsequently, others concluded that the longer survival time reported by Gonzalez was due to selection bias and other confounds. Rejection by mainstream medicine Like his mentor, William Donald Kelley, Gonzalez's treatment method has been \\"rejected\\" by the \\"medical establishment\\". Gonzalez has been characterized as a quack and fraud by other doctors and health fraud watchdog groups, and in 1994 was reprimanded and placed on two years' probation by the New York state medical board for \\"departing from accepted practice\\". Forced to submit to psychological examinations and undergo retraining, Gonzalez was given two years of probation with a stipulation that he undergo retraining and do 200 hours of community service, which he completed satisfactorily. He was fully licensed to practice in New York. Gonzalez has lost two malpractice lawsuits. In 1997, a New York court found Gonzalez \\"negligent\\" for his cancer treatment;Charell v. Gonzalez, 660 N.Y.S. 2d 665 (Sup Ct., 1997). according to news reports, Gonzalez \\"had to pay $2.5 million in damages to a patient he wrongly claimed to have cured\\" of cancer. The former patient had been diagnosed with uterine cancer but \\"Gonzalez discouraged her from following through on her cancer specialist's advice, instead recommending dietary supplements and frequent coffee enemas\\". The patient had refused both standard treatment and an experimental protocol, but after the cancer spread to her spine, she discontinued Gonzalez's treatment and received chemotherapy and external beam radiation. Sometime in this period, she began having problems with her eyesight, back and hip, and she eventually became blind.Gonzalez v. Ellenberg, 2004 NY Slip Op 51518(U) (NY 10/12/2004), 2004 NY Slip Op 51518 (NY, 2004), retrieved January 1, 2009 In 2000, Gonzalez was found partly liable (49%) in the death of a patient with Hodgkin's disease and ordered to pay $282,000 in damages, due to his use of an unproven cancer screening method instead of standard cancer testing. The American Cancer Society notes that there is \\"no convincing scientific evidence that [the Gonzalez treatment] is effective in treating cancer\\" and that some portions of the treatment may be harmful. A review article from the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology is cited that notes the clinical efficacy of coffee enemas has not been proven and the therapy is associated with adverse effects previously described in a few case reports. Gonzalez's study published in Nutrition and Cancer in 1999 was criticized by an expert in integrative oncology research methods for its small sample size, selection bias, and failure to account for confounding variables. Gonzalez \\"has never explicitly rejected the more orthodox precepts of his profession\\", insisting that he wants his research evaluated by independent scientists. Clinical trial A randomized phase III clinical trial for the possible treatment of pancreatic cancer with the Gonzalez Regimen was funded by a $1.4 million grant from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and co-sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, awarded in 1999 to Columbia University's Rosenthal Center for Alternative Medicine. The trial was designed to compare the efficacy of pancreatic enzyme therapy plus specialized diet with gemcitabine for stage II, stage III, or stage IV pancreatic cancer. However, the study had difficulty attracting patients,\\"Cancer's Enema No. 1? Make That 2\\", Wired, 30 October 2002 and most eligible patients refused random assignment, so the trial was changed in 2001 to a controlled, observational study. The trial found that patients treated with the Gonzalez regime survived on average for 4.3 months; those using standard chemotherapy survived on average for 14 months and reported a better quality of life. An accompanying editorial said it was troubling that expensive CAM therapies were not backed by firm evidence, and that the trial of the Gonzalez regimen was not capable of providing a definitive conclusion because of flaws in its design. Kimball Atwood said that flaws in the trial design might have led to bias in favor of the Gonzalez regimen but that it nevertheless amounted to \\"a slam-dunk condemnation\\" of the therapy. This trial had been criticized for its implausible and unsupported theoretical model of cancer development which bears no resemblance to the scientific understanding of neoplasia, and because of Gonzalez's history of malpractice.

It draws analogies between the September 11, 2001, attacks and the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. The title is taken from the 2000 paper \\"Rebuilding America's Defenses\\" produced by the Project for the New American Century, which asserted that only a \\"new Pearl Harbor\\" would enable the military and defense policy transformations the group desired to rapidly take place. The book was included in the official selection of 99 books made available to all members of the 9/11 Commission and was found on Osama Bin Laden's bookshelf during the raid. Content In the book, Griffin presents pieces of evidence and arguments which he believes support a conclusion that the George W. Bush administration was complicit in the September 11, 2001, attacks, and therefore constituted a false flag incident. The foreword was written by Richard A. Falk, Professor emeritus at Princeton University. Part One of the book looks at the events of 9/11, discussing each Flight in turn and also the behavior of President George W. Bush and his Secret Service protection. Part Two examines 9/11 in a wider context, in the form of four \\"disturbing questions\\": *Did US Officials have advance information about 9/11? *Did US Officials obstruct investigations prior to 9/11? *Did US Officials have reasons for allowing 9/11? *Did US Officials block captures and investigations after 9/11? Critical response Critics of the book argue that many of the claims in the book are easily refuted, and that there are many leaps of logic. Griffin rejects such criticisms and has debated his critics. According to former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent Robert Baer, writing in The Nation magazine: > What's notable about Griffin's take on these events is how easily he leaps > to larger evils, a conspiracy at the top. Griffin is a thoughtful, well- > informed theologian who before September 11 probably would not have gone > anywhere near a conspiracy theory.

Research in this area originated in the field of social psychology, but communication scholars have also provided ample research in compliance gaining. While persuasion focuses on attitudes and beliefs, compliance gaining focuses on behavior. Overview Compliance gaining occurs whenever a person intentionally induces another person to do something that they might have not done otherwise. Compliance gaining and persuasion are related; however, they are not one and the same. Changes in attitudes and beliefs are often the goal in persuasion; compliance gaining seeks to change the behavior of a target. It is not necessary to change a person's attitude or beliefs to gain compliance. For instance, an automobile driver might have positive attitudes towards driving fast. The threat of a speeding ticket from a police officer positioned in a speed trap may gain compliance from the driver. Conversely, persuading someone to change their attitude or belief will not necessarily gain compliance. A doctor might tell a patient that tobacco use poses a serious threat to a smoker's health. The patient may accept this as a fact and view smoking negatively, but might also continue to use tobacco. Developments Compliance gaining research has its roots in social psychology, but overlaps with many other disciplines such as communication and sociology. Compliance gaining can occur via mediated channels, but the research is most associated with interpersonal communication. In 1967, sociologists Marwell and Schmitt attempted to explain how people select compliance gaining messages. The researchers posited that people have a mental bank of strategies that they draw from when selecting a message. Marwell and Schmitt created a typology for compliance gaining techniques: promise, threat, positive expertise, negative expertise, liking, pregiving, aversive stimulation, debt, moral appeal, positive self-feeling, negative self-feeling, positive altercasting, negative altertcasting, altruism, positive esteem, and negative esteem. This study was the catalyst for more interest in compliance gaining from communication scholars. Miller, Boster, Roloff, and Seibold (1977) as well as Cody and McLaughlin (1980) studied the situational variables that influences compliance gaining strategies. The latter study identified six different typologies of situations that can influence compliance gaining behaviors: personal benefits (how much personal gain an actor can yield from the influencing behavior), dominance (the power relation between the actor and the target), rights (whether the actor has the right to expect compliance), resistance (how easy will the target be influenced), intimacy (whether the relation between actor and target is shallow), and consequences (what sort of effect this situation would have on the relationship between actor and target). Dillard and Burgoon (1985) later investigated the Cody-McLaughlin typologies. They concluded that situational variables, as described by Cody and McLaughlin, did very little to predict compliance gaining strategy selection. As early as 1982, there was already strong criticism about the strength of the relationships between situational variables and compliance gaining message selection. By the 1990s, many research efforts attempting to link compliance gaining strategy selection and features of a situation or features of the individual \\"failed to coalesce into a coherent body of knowledge\\". Situational dimensions and individual differences were not effective in predicting so researchers went into other perspectives in an effort to understand compliance gaining. For instance, Schrader and Dillard (1998) linked primary and secondary goals to compliance gaining strategy. Using the theoretical framework of Goals-Plans-Actions developed by Dillard in 1980, Schrader and Dillard operate from the assumption that individuals possess and act on multiple goals. In any compliance seeking situation, the actor has primary goals that drive the attempt to influence a target. The primary goal is what the interaction is all about. For instance, if an actor wants a target to stop smoking, this is the primary goal and this is what drives the interaction. However, in the course of pursuing that goal, there are \\"secondary\\" goals to consider. These are goals that limit the behavior of the actor. If getting a target to stop smoking is the primary goal, then a secondary goal might be to maintain a friendly relationship with the target. Dillard specifies five types of secondary goals that temper the compliance gaining behavior: identity goals (morals and personal standards), interaction goals (impression management), relational resource goals (relationship management), personal resource goals (material concerns of the actor), and arousal management goals (efforts to manage anxiety about the compliance gaining attempt). Despite the charges of individual differences making very little progress in prediction compliance gaining strategies, some researchers in the 2000s have focused their efforts to rectify this weakness in the research to link individual differences with compliance gaining effectiveness. King (2001), acknowledging the paucity of robust situational and trait studies linked to compliance gaining, attempted to isolate one situation as a predictor for compliance gaining message selection. King's research suggested that when target of compliance gaining were perceived to be less resistant to influence attempts, the actors used more compliance gaining tactics. When targets were perceived as strongly resistant, the actors used less tactics. Elias and Loomis (2004) found that gender and race affect an instructor's ability to gain compliance in a college classroom. Punyanunt (2000) found that using humor may enhance the effectiveness of pro-social compliance gaining techniques in the classroom. Remland and Jones (1994) found that vocal intensity and touch also affect compliance gaining. Goei et al. (2003) posited that \\"feelings of liking\\" between target and actor as well as doing favors for the target lead to liking and obligation, which leads to increased compliance. Pre-giving (giving a target a small gift or favor such as a free sample of food) is positively associated with increased compliance in strangers. One of the major criticisms of examining compliance gaining literature is that very little research studies actual compliance. Filling out a survey and reporting intent to comply with a request is certainly different than actually completing the request. For example, many people might report that they will comply with a doctor's order, but away from the doctor's office, they may ignore medical advice. Application Compliance gaining research has a fairly diverse background so much of the research uses alternate paradigms and perspectives. As mentioned above, the field of compliance gaining originated in social psychology, but was adopted by many communication scholars as well. Many fields from consumer psychology to primary education pedagogy have taken great interest in compliance gaining.  Medicine  Doctors have expressed much frustration with compliance resistance from their patients. A reported 50% of patients do not comply with medical advice and prescriptions. Researchers, as well as medical professionals, have a vested interest in learning strategies that can increase compliance in their patients. Many severe and chronic conditions can be avoided if early treatments are followed as prescribed, avoiding death, permanent injury, and costlier medical treatments later on. Researchers in communication have reported some key findings such as: clear and effective communication about a patient's condition or illness increases the likelihood of patient compliance with medical advice; doctors that use humor in their communication with patients have higher satisfaction rates; high satisfaction rates with physicians is highly correlated with patient compliance.  Pedagogy  For teachers, gaining compliance from students is a must for effective teaching. Studies in compliance gaining have ranged from elementary education all the way to adult and higher education.  Sales and consumer psychology  Advertising and marketing are tools of persuasion. There is literally centuries' worth of literature available about persuasion. However, changing attitudes and beliefs about a product does not necessarily change behaviors. Purchasing a product is a behavior. Researchers such as Parrish- Sprowl, Carveth, & Senk (1994) have applied compliance gaining research to effective sales. Compliance Compliance gaining was not originally conceived in the field of communication but found its roots in the late 1960s as a result of studies and research by two sociologists, Gerald Marwell and David Schmitt. In 1967, Marwell and Schmitt produced some interesting compliance-gaining tactics concerning the act of getting a teenager to study. The tactics, sixteen in all, are as follows. # Promise: If you comply, I will reward you. For example, you offer to increase Dick's allowance if he studies more. # Threat: If you do not comply, I will punish you. For example, you threaten to forbid Dick to use the car if he doesn't start studying more. # Expertise (positive): If you comply, you will be rewarded because of the \\"nature of things.\\" For example, you tell Dick that if he gets good grades he be able to get into college and get a good job. # Expertise (negative): If you do not comply, you will be punished because of the \\"nature of things.\\" For example, you tell Dick that if he does not get good grades he will not be able to get into college or get a good job. # Liking: Act friendly and helpful to get the person in a \\"good frame of mind\\" so they comply with the request. For example, you try to be as friendly and pleasant as possible to put Dick in a good mood before asking him to study. # Pre-giving: Reward the person before requesting compliance. For example, raise Dick's allowance and tell him you now expect him to study. # Aversive stimulation: Continuously punish the person, making cessation contingent on compliance. For example, you tell Dick he may not use the car until he studies more. # Debt: You owe me compliance because of past favors. For example, you point out that you have sacrificed and saved to pay for Dick's education and that he owes it to you to get good enough grades to get into a good college. # Moral appeal: You are immoral if you do not comply. You tell Dick that it is morally wrong for anyone not to get as good grades as possible and that he should study more. # Self-feeling (positive): You will feel better about yourself if you comply. For example, you tell Dick that he will feel proud if he gets himself to study more. # Self-feeling (negative): You will feel worse about yourself if you do not comply. For example, you tell Dick that he will feel ashamed of himself if he gets bad grades. # Altercasting (positive): A person with \\"good\\" qualities would comply. For example, you tell Dick that because he is a mature and intelligent person he naturally will want to study more and get good grades. # Altercasting (negative): Only a person with \\"bad\\" qualities would not comply. For example, you tell Dick that he should study because only someone very childish does not study. # Altruism: I need your compliance very badly, so do it for me. For example, you tell Dick that you really want very badly for him to get into a good college and that you wish he would study more as a personal favor to you. # Esteem (positive): People you value will think better of you if you comply. For example, you tell Dick that the whole family will be very proud of him if he gets good grades. # Esteem (negative): People you value will think the worse of you if you do not comply. For example, you tell Dick that the whole family will be very disappointed in him if he gets poor grades. In 1967, Marwell and Schmitt conducted experimental research, using the sixteen compliance gaining tactics and identified five basic compliance- gaining strategies: Rewarding activity, Punishing activity, Expertise, Activation of impersonal commitments, and Activation of personal commitments. Power Another element of compliance-gaining was produced in the early 1960s, as French and Raven were researching the concepts of power, legitimacy, and politeness. They identified five influential aspects associated with power, which help illustrate elements of the study of compliance. The fives bases of power are as follows: # Reward Power: A person with reward power has control over some valued resource (e.g., promotions and raises). # Coercive Power: A person with coercive power has the ability to inflict punishments (e.g., fire you). # Expert Power: Expert power is based on what a person knows (e.g., you may do what a doctor tells you to do because they know more about medicine than you do). # Legitimate Power: Legitimate power is based on formal rank or position (e.g., you obey someone's commands because they are the vice president in the company for which you work). # Referent Power: People have referent power when the person they are trying to influence wants to be like them (e.g., a mentor often has this type of power). (French & Raven, 1960) Techniques The study of compliance gaining has been central in the development of many commonly used or heard of techniques. The following techniques are a few of what has evolved as a product of the study of compliance gaining strategies. Note, many of these techniques have been empirically documented increasing compliance.  Foot-in-the-door (FITD)  With research starting in 1966 by Freedman & Fraser, foot-in-the door is one of the earliest and most researched compliance gaining techniques. This technique gains compliance by making a smaller easy request then a larger more difficult request at a later time. The smaller request is usually one that would be widely accepted without scrutiny. The larger request is usually the actual the task or goal wanted to be completed. = Effectivity = Freedman and Fraser thought that after satisfying the smaller initial request, if the person was not forced to do then they must be \\"the type of person who fulfills such requests\\". The smaller task/request should relate to the larger request and not be trivial. For the foot-in-the-door technique to be successful it must generate the self-aware \\"I am the kind of person who fulfills this type of request\\" other wise known as the self-perception theory. Other studies found that if the initial request is easy but unusual or bizarre, it would also generate the foot-in-the-door effectiveness. This idea was developed further into the Disrupt-Then-Reframe technique. There are other reasons besides the self-perception theory that makes the foot-in-the-door technique successful. Consistency ‚Äì Cialdini and Guadagno, Asher, and Demaine believe that what makes people want to fulfill larger request is the need to be consistent. The Norm to Help Others ‚Äì Harris believed that after the first request, the norm to help others becomes clear. It only becomes evident after the person reviews his or her reason why they completed the original request. Satisfying the First Request ‚Äì Crano and Sivacek thought what made the technique so effective was personal satisfaction. \\"The person learns that the fulfillment of request brings the reward of a positive experience. One may assume that the likelihood that satisfaction of this type appears willi increase if the person has to react to something unusual that awakens his or her mindfulness, and will decrease in situations in which the person reacts automatically and habitually\\".  Door-in-the-face (DITF)  Door-in-the- face was first introduced in 1975 by Cialdini and colleagues. The opposite of foot-in-the-door, in the door-in-the-face technique, the requestor asks a large objectionable request which is denied by the target instead of gaining compliance by asking a smaller easy request. The requestor seeking compliance ask a smaller more reasonable request. There are several theories that explain why door-in-the-face is an effective gaining compliance technique. Self- presentation theory ‚Äì \\"that individuals will comply with a second request due to fears one will be perceived negatively by rejecting successive prosocial request for compliance\\". Reciprocal concessions ‚Äì this theory describes the effects of door-in-the-face as a \\"process of mutual concessions\\". \\"The second request represents a concession on the part of the sender (from his or her initial request), and compliance to the second request represents a concession on the part of the receiver (from his or her inclination to not comply with the first request)\\". Guilt ‚Äì One reason that makes door-in-the-face such an effective technique is people feel guilty for refusing to comply with a request twice.(Carpenter, p 163) Social Responsibility ‚Äì this theory describes the social repercussions and pressures that occur if an individual declines a request. All together the theories propose that a target who declines the first request feel a \\"personal or social responsibility\\" to comply with the second request. In an effort to avoid feeling guilty or reduce the sense of obligation the target would have.  Recent techniques = Disrupt-then- reframe (DTR)  DTR was first introduced by Barbara Price Davis and Eric S. Knowles in 1999. This technique states that a person will be more likely to comply with a request if the initial request or pitch is confusing. The pitch is immediately followed by a reframing or a reason to comply with the request. An example of this technique is: A waiter states that \\"the steak dinner is on special for 800 pennies; it's a really good deal\\". Disrupting the couple by saying \\"800 pennies\\" instead of \\"8 dollars\\", the waiter is able to increase the likelihood that they will buy the steak dinner. DTR was found to be a very effective way to gain compliance in non-profit instances such as raising money for charities or asking people to take a survey. DTR was found to be less successful as a sales technique; this may be because the message is more scrutinized, making it harder to confuse the target.  Persistence  Persistence used as a compliance gaining technique, gets the target to comply by repeating the message. In 1979, Cacioppo and Petty found that repeating the message more than five times lead to decrease in compliance. Success is enhanced if the repetition comes from more than one person and is enhanced further if the message has the same idea or meaning but is not exact. An example of this technique would be: \\"My wife kept reminding me to take out the trash until I finally did it.\\"  Dump and chase (DAC)  Persistence has a high probability of annoying the target and creating a negative interaction which could be viewed as \\"nagging\\". A way to avoid this would be rejecting the targets objection to your request by asking \\"why not?\\", then forming another message to overcome the second objection to gain compliance. This technique is called dump and chase. Mechanics of this technique are urgency and guilt. When the repeated message is presented to the target it may be perceived as urgent, thus making it seem more important, and more willing to comply. By creating a sense of obligation in the request, the target may develop guilt if not willing to comply.  Just-One-More (JOM)  Just-One-More was developed as a way to make a donation seem more important. The use of this technique involves using the language of \\"Just-One-More\\" to gain compliance.(Carpenter, p. 164) The technique is found to be most useful in instances regarding volunteering and donations. It is seen as \\"the last person to help will be more rewarding than being one of the first or those in the middle, due to the expectation that the requestor will appreciate the last person more than any of those who complied previously\\". For Example: \\"Do you want to buy this car? I need just one more sale to reach my quota this month.\\" If the target finds that the requestor is lying or being deceptive about being the last one, it will create a negative outlook on the person and the organization that he or she represents. Even though losing some of the effectiveness the requestor could state that they are \\"close to their goal\\" or \\"almost there\\".  64 compliance gaining strategies  In \\"Classifying Compliance Gaining Messages: Taxonomic Disorder and Strategic Confusion\\", Kathy Kellermann and Tim Cole put together 64 compliance gaining strategies as an attempt to classify more than 820 previous strategies. # Actor Takes Responsibility: Try to get others to comply by stating your willingness to help them or even work on the request yourself. That is, try to gain their compliance by offering to do it yourself as a means of getting them to do what you want. Example: \\"Is there anything I can do to so you can finish the project on time?\\" # Altercasting (Negative): Try to get others to comply by pointing out that only a bad person would not do what is wanted. That is, try to gain their compliance by noting that only a person with negative qualities wouldn't comply. Example: \\"You should stop watching these types of television shows as only a disturbed person would like them.\\" # Altercasting (Positive): Try to get others to comply by pointing out that a good person would do what is wanted. That is, try to gain their compliance by noting that any person with positive qualities would comply. Example: \\"A good boy would eat all his vegetables.\\" # Altruism: Try to get others to comply by asking them to give you a hand out of the goodness of their heart. That is, try to gain their compliance by asking them to be altruistic and just do it for you. Example: \\"Could you help me move, I would really appreciate it.\\" # Assertion: Try to get others to comply by asserting (forcefully stating) what you want. That is, try to gain their compliance by demanding (commanding) them to comply. Example: \\"Go get a bandaid now!\\" # Audience-Use: Try to get others to comply by having a group of other people present when you make your request. That is, try to gain their compliance by asking them in front of other people as a way to back up your request. Example: \\"I asked her to go to the prom with me in front of her friends.\\" # Authority Appeal: Try to get others to comply on the basis of the authority that you or other people have. That is, try to gain their compliance by using or relying on a position of power over them to get them do to what you want. Example: \\"My boss told me to get him the reports by 10 am so I did.\\" # Aversive Stimulation: Try to get others to comply by doing things they don't like until they agree to comply. That is, try to gain their compliance by bothering them until they do what you want. Example: \\"My co-worker kept bothering me to quit smoking until I finally did.\\" # Bargaining: Try to get others to comply by striking a bargain with them. That is, try to gain their compliance by negotiating a deal where you each do something for the other so everyone gets what they want. Example: \\"If you help me with the dishes, I will help you with the laundry.\\" # Benefit (Other): Try to get others to comply by telling them people other than themselves would benefit if they do what you want. That is, try to gain their compliance by pointing out how it helps people other than themselves if they comply. Example: \\"By donating to our fundraiser, You ensure that everyone will have a coat this winter.\\" #Benefit (Self): Try to get others to comply by telling them you personally would benefit if they do what you want. That is, try to gain their compliance by pointing out how it helps oneself if they comply. Example: \\"If you helped me with the yard work, then I won't get a ticket by the city tomorrow.\\" #Benefit (Target): Try to get others to comply by telling them they personally would benefit if they do what you want. That is, try to gain their compliance by pointing out how it helps them if they comply. Example: \\"If you go grocery shopping for me tonight then you will have something for lunch tomorrow.\\" #Challenge: Try to get others to comply by challenging them to do what you want. That is, try to gain their compliance by provoking, stimulating, tempting, goading, and/or galvanizing them to comply. Example: I didn't want to race until his car pulled beside mine and he revved the engine. #Compliment: Try to get others to comply by complimenting them on their abilities or accomplishments. That is, try to gain their compliance by praising them to get them to do what you want. Example: With that jump shot, you would be really good at basketball. #Compromise: Try to get others to comply by offering to compromise with them. That is, try to gain their compliance by making a concession to them so they'll make their concession to you and do what you want. Example: \\"I will drop you off at the airport if you will go to the dentist with me.\\" # Cooperation: Try to get others to comply by being cooperative and collaborating with them. That is, try to gain their compliance not by telling the other person what to do but by offering to discuss things and work them out together. Example: \\"We should get the team together and brainstorm new ideas for this problem.\\" #Criticize: Try to get others to comply by criticizing them. That is, try to gain their compliance by attacking them on a personal level to get them to do what you want. Example: \\"It looks like you're really gaining some weight, why don't you go on a run with me.\\" #Debasement: Try to get others to comply by acting pitiful and pleading. That is, try to gain their compliance by debasing, demeaning, degrading, devaluing, humiliating, and/or lowering yourself so as to deprive yourself of esteem or self-worth to get them to do what you want. Example: \\"I am so stupid, I can't believe I deleted the report. Can you please go delay the presentation.\\" #Debt: Try to get others to comply by reminding them they are in debt to you because of things you have done for them in the past. That is, try to gain their compliance by indicating that they owe it to you to do what you want. Example: \\"You should paid for my lunch, I bought your lunch last time.\\" #Deceit: Try to get others to comply by misleading them. That is, try to gain their compliance by lying to or deceiving them. Example: \\"We told them the car was in perfect working order, but the transmission is about to go out.\\" #Direct Request: Try to get others to comply by just making a direct request. That is, try to gain their compliance by simply asking or stating what you want without giving any reasons for them to comply. Example: \\"Can I use the computer?\\" #Disclaimer (Norms/Rules): Try to get others to comply by downplaying or disavowing restrictions and constraints that might prevent them from doing what you want them to do. That is, try to gain their compliance by pointing out that otherwise applicable procedures, rules, norms, and/or expectations should be broken in this instance.

History = Geologic  Ruggs' geologic history echoes that of other areas in the region. Ruggs is geologically situated within the Columbia Basin, a region overlain with Loess soils and rugged basaltic foothills that were the product of glacial floods and Columbia River Basalt Group lava flows. Basalt is the major bedrock underlying the canyons and plateaus surrounding Ruggs. Ruggs is situated close to where the Columbia Basin and Blue Mountain ecological provinces end and begin, respectively. The Columbia Basin Ecological Province is mainly a hilly upland that slopes up from north to south and that is dissected by numerous dendritic-pattern drainages. This ecological region is further subdivided into the northern ancient lake basin and the southern silty uplands. Soils in the area typically consist Bakeoven-Morrow complex, Lickskillet stony loam, Lickskillet-Rock outcrop, Morrow silt loam, and Onyx silt loam. The Columbia Basin Ecological Province merges with the Blue Mountain Ecological Province close to an elevation of around 3,500 feet (1,067 m). Columbia Basin.  Native Americans  Ruggs served as part of a broader area where local Native American tribes seasonally inhabited. Native Americans lived and traveled between the Columbia Gorge and the Blue Mountains for more than 10,000 years prior to European-American settlement. Local newspapers record visits between local Native Americans and settlers in the present-day Ruggs area in the late 1800s, including a visit by Hin-mah-too-yah-lat-kekt (Chief Joseph) of the Wal-lam-wat-kain (Wallowa) band of Nez Perce. \\"Old Blind Jim\\" and his small tribe known as the Columbia River Renegades frequented the area. Jim was of royal Columbia tribe heritage and his tribe fished salmon and hunted berries, elk, bear, and other wild game in the Blue Mountains during summer.  Pioneer Settlement  The Rhea and Wright families settled in the area in 1864 and 1873, respectively. The Elijah W. Rhea family lived on Rhea creek approximately 12 miles upstream from the confluence of Rhea and Willow creeks. The Albert Wright family settled further upstream on Rhea Creek. Local history and newspaper records indicate that Daniel Taylor Spencer established a store here in 1872. That store, however, was eventually relocated to nearby Heppner in 1873. Orin E. Farnsworth arrived to the area circa 1874 and settled in a nearby area known as \\"Midway.\\"  The Rugg Family  North Dakota = The community is named after Edward E. Rugg, Jr. Rugg Jr. was born 5 January 1880 in Mason City, Iowa. Edward E. Rugg Sr. and Lilla Rugg, Rugg Jr's mother and father, gained local prominence in North Dakota where they farmed and helped organize the Nekoma Farmers Grain and Fuel Company in Nekoma, North Dakota in 1909. In March 1911, Rugg Sr. and his family moved to a farm near Hood River, Oregon from Easby, North Dakota. Tax records, however, suggest that the family had connections to eastern Oregon a few years prior to moving.Courier Democrat. (Langdon, N.D.), 26 Aug. 1909.

Ruggs is located in the Columbia Plateau ecoregion of eastern Oregon. This ecoregion is an arid, sagebrush steppe and grassland underlain by basalt up to two miles thick. Loess soils once supported bunchgrass prairies but are now widely cultivated for winter wheat.Thorson, T.D., Bryce, S.A., Lammers, D.A., Woods, A.J., Omernik, J.M., Kagan, J., Pater, D.E., and Comstock, J.A., 2003.

Bonneville Power Administration, www.bpa.gov/power/pl/columbia/4-geology.htm. Areas with thick loess deposits are typically dry farmed with winter wheat or irrigated alfalfa and barley. Rangeland dominates in more rugged areas with thinner loess deposits. Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 15 inches and increases with increasing elevation. Scablands, composed of arrays of earth mounds surrounded by rock polygons, are relics of Pleistocene glacial periods. Ruggs lies along Rhea Creek, a tributary of Willow Creek in the Blue Mountains east of the Cascades. These creeks eventually converge and flow north into the Columbia Gorge at Heppner Junction, a Union Pacific station located on the left bank at the mouth of Willow Creek at Columbia River Mile (RM) 252.  Government = Postal Service  Newspaper records suggest that the Ruggs area at one point had its own post office known as \\"Midway\\" on the aforementioned Wright family's property.Source: ‚ÄúLooking Around the County: Rhea Creek - Ruggs - ‚ÄòMidway‚Äô‚Äù Heppner gazette-times., August 24, 1972, Centennial Edition;University of Oregon Libraries 1501 Kincaid Street Eugene, OR 97403-1299; Image provided by: Morrow County Museum; Heppner, OR  Elected Officials  Ruggs has no elected officials.

It was operational from mid-September to mid-December 1958. It would eventually lead to Operation Chrome Dome, as it was part of a series of programs which showed that a continuous airborne alert could be achieved. Background Operation Head Start was experimented at Loring Air Force Base, from September to December, 1958. Through the actions of the crewmembers, it helped to demonstrate that a continuous airborne alert could be maintained successfully. Before each flight, a briefing would be held, alerting the crewmembers to basic world events as well as safety criteria. At least fifteen hours before takeoff, the crew would thoroughly pre-flight their aircraft. Inadvertently, this also increased efficiency in terms of maintenance and other pre-flight routines. For the next twelve hours, crewmembers would enter a period of uninterrupted rest, and use the next three hours to prepare for takeoff. During this final preparation, they would first be taken to the cafeteria, where they would be fed a meal high in protein. After their final briefing, two crewmembers would be sent to pick up specialized meals for their long flight (the meals would later be prepared in an oven during flight). Every six hours, a bomber would then take off with live warheads and continue on a pre-determined path over Greenland and eastern Canada, a trip that would end twenty hours later. Frequently, \\"Foxtrot: No message required,\\" messages would be sent to the bomber from Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base, with the idea that one of them could tell them to go to war, helping keep the crews on their feet. During their flight, many of the boom operators would enter admission into the Million Pound Club, which meant that they had transferred a million or more pounds of fuel on ten sorties or less. The added benefit of the training runs, is that it made refuelling more routine. The corresponding group for the bomber crews would be the One Gulp Club, for those who had taken on a hundred thousand pounds of fuel without a disconnect. While entering the landing pattern, the tower would alert the crash trucks to travel to the runway and await landing. This was a standard procedure for all Head Start landings. After landing, the crew would be interrogated prior to being let go, so that maintenance, intelligence, and other crews could be alerted to the performance of the plane and other things that the crew might have noticed during their long flight. After being let go, they would typically go to the Physical Conditioning room for a steam bath and rub down. After six sorties, each bomber would receive a major individual inspection, allowing for it to be rotated out of the cycle. Phases Head Start was directed to occur in three phases. Phase I would be a practising of the above procedures. Phase II would be a standing down of the wing, with one squadron being dispersed to Bergstrom Air Force Base in Texas. Phase III would include operating the above procedures, but using Bergstrom as a base of operations as well.

Some of the basic instruments that use reeds include the clarinet, saxophone, oboe and bassoon. Proper care of reeds will extend their longevity and control bacterial growth.  Reed care = Reed preparation  Wooden reeds must be moistened prior to playing. Many musicians place the reed in their mouths to moisten them with saliva. In preparing the reed for playing, water is less corrosive than saliva. Soaking a reed in water for about five minutes is a good alternative to saliva. It also reduces the chance of food particles damaging the reed.Stambler, David. \\"Single Reed Reed Basics.\\" 2005. Penn State University. http://www.capitolquartet.com/admin/pdf/Reedbasics.pdf. However, soaking reeds in already humid weather may cause them to become water-logged; extreme environments can damage reeds. They should not be kept too dry or too wet, or they will become warped.Williams, Floyd. \\"Reeds: How to Care for Them and How to Improve Their Response.\\" Australian Clarinet and Saxophone. June 2003: 11-12 Dark spots on new reeds are not an indication that the reeds are poor, but if the dark spots have formed after several uses, it may be an indication of mold growth. Therefore, it is also suggested that one soak one's reed in hydrogen peroxide. Five minutes a day is sufficient to keep the reed clean from bacteria and mold. It should also destroy any salivary enzymes that may have collected on the reed while playing. If hydrogen peroxide is not available, musicians need to be sure to rinse the reed in running water and then dry it before storing. Reed case  Reed storage  Reed storage affects the reed life and may help or hinder bacterial and mold growth. Putting a dirty reed in a reed case just allows mold and bacteria to grow in the case every time the reed is placed in it. Mold can also grow if reeds are kept in a tightly sealed container in humid environments. Every time the container is opened moisture is caught inside, allowing mold to grow. Storage in a cool, dry environment, like a refrigerator, helps to slow microbial growth.Bryan, A. H. (1960). Band instruments harbor germs. Music Educators Journal, 46(5), 84-85. Light and ultraviolet radiation will not damage the reed structure unless exposure time is excessive or if radiation levels are high. A cool cabinet with a desiccant, such as calcium sulfate, can also serve as a good storage area. Not only do cooler environments discourage bacterial growth, but there are almost no harmful effects on a normal reed. Heat can have a damaging effect on the chemical authenticity of the reed. Soaking the reed in nearly boiling water is not recommended for cleaning. The hydrogen bonds begin to break down between 60 ¬∞C and 80 ¬∞C. At 100 ¬∞C much of the molecular structure is lost. Heating dry wood can also cause splitting. When not being used, reeds should be kept covered. There are many products available specifically for reed storage.  Personal hygiene and reed care  Reed longevity is affected by the musician's personal hygiene habits. As many band directors encourage, eating prior to playing is not good for one's instrument or for one's own health. Old food is a gold mine for bacterial growth, especially microbial flora. Appropriately, one might brush their teeth, floss, and use mouthwash, before and after playing to lower risks of illness. Using a reed while sick with a cold increases mucous discharge from the throat and lungs onto the reed. This will more quickly strip hemicellulose from the reed. Hemicellulose maintains the reed's ability to hold water. Using a reed while sick quickly decreases the reed's ability to absorb water; this is irreversible damage. Also, using a reed while sick increases the chance for reinfection. It is common that musicians just use old spent reeds while ill to keep from damaging good reeds.  The effect of saliva on reeds  pH Levels = Normally, saliva is slightly acidic and has a pH less than 7, but it can vary between 6 and 8. The pH inside the mouth depends on the salival flow rate because the higher the flow rate of saliva the more salival bicarbonates are present. Bicarbonates in the saliva raise the pH inside the mouth. When there is no or low saliva flow, also known as xerostomia, the pH inside the mouth is around 6. When salival flow rate is high the pH is about 8. During a concert, if a musician is suffering from xerostomia, also known as dry mouth, the saliva pH is expected to be acidic. Nervousness in concert situations can also lead to xerostomia, but more importantly nervousness can cause rapid breathing. This increases carbon dioxide (CO2 ) flow out of the body and causes respiratory alkalosis. The decrease in CO2 affects the amount of bicarbonates available. Salivary bicarbonates are synthesized from CO2. The less CO2 available, the fewer bicarbonates can be synthesized; therefore, the pH drops. Under this condition it is wise to use salival flow stimulants. Continually changing the pH environment the reed encounters damages the reed. If the pH level inside the mouth can be kept at rehearsal level, the life of the reed will increase. Consequently, the environment for regular rehearsal differs. The musician may not be as nervous, and they might be holding their breath more to play. Holding one's breath increases CO2, also known as respiratory acidosis. Therefore, saliva is expected to be more alkaline. In a reeds life, it is more likely to face alkaline environments because rehearsals occur more often than concerts. The alkaline environment increases the amount of hemicellulose stripped from the reed matrix. Although hemicellulose is depleted, it is better for the reed to remain in an overall consistent environment. 275 px = Contaminants in saliva = Even though salival pH decreases the hemicelluloses coating on reeds, it has little effect on the reed matrix compared to the contaminants found in saliva. Amines and glycoproteins have been found in the reed matrix: salivary mucosins, Proline- rich Glycoproteins, alpha-amylases, peroxidase, Carbonic Anhydrase, Fucose- rich glycoproteins, Immunoglobulin, Kallikrein, Lactoferrin, and Fibronectrin. Oral bacterium already in one's mouth removes the sugar containing components from glycoproteins in saliva. This removal of sugar forms a precipitate or a non-soluble by-product. The protein precipitate formed in saliva is normally rich in calcium and low in solubility. Also, alpha-amylase contains a significant level of sialic acid. When alpha-amylase combines with saliva, the enzymes hydrolyze and release the sialic acid, forming another water-insoluble precipitate. These two precipitates combine to form an impenetrable layer on the reed, which prevent the reed from fully hydrating. In time, the reed will become stiff and brittle.  Types of Bacteria found in reeds  Streptococcal bacteria have been found living inside the walls of water- conducting xylem cells in spent reeds. Streptococcal bacterium is a common bacterium that causes illness to the throat, including sore throat and strep throat. Also the common bacterium, Staphalcoccus Epidermitis, completely covers the reed. It is also found all over the mouth and hands on virtually everyone; therefore, it is innocuous. Staphalcoccus Epidermitis is known as one of the bacteria which remove the sugars from saliva, which causes the deposition of sialic acid. This type of bacteria becomes dormant in the absence of water. Drying reeds before storing will help stop the growth of Staphalcoccus Epidermitis.  The effect of bacteria on reeds  Bacterium affects the playability of the reed in three ways. First, it adds mass to the reed tip. A bacterial coating actually dampens the vibrating reed, causing it to play at lower frequencies. Secondly, it reduces the reed's range of motion and bending. This will decrease the reeds ability to maintain sound. Lastly, it changes the overall shape of the reed, which directly affects the tone quality.  The Effect of Reed Bacteria on the Body  The bacteria found covering reeds may cause respiratory infections such as colds, influenza, pneumonia, tuberculosis, herpes fibrilis (cold sores), and other rare diseases. However, contact is necessary for the transfer of microbial infection. The airborne organisms are known to be virtually harmless. Infection will not spread between musicians unless there is contact with the bacteria. 300 px Specifically, streptococci can cause varying levels of infections from mild to life-threatening. Starting in the 1980s, group A streptococci have increased in prevalence and have been the cause of rheumatic fever and other invasive infections.Horaud T., Bouvet A., Leclercq R., Montclos H. d. and Sicard M. Streptococci and The Host. New York: Plenum Press. 1997: 255, 537. The mucous membranes found in the nose and throat are primary sites for infection and transmission of group A streptococci. The mucus membranes are in direct contact with the reed during playing; therefore, if infection does occur it is likely it will derive from the group A streptococci. When group A streptococcal infects the throat, it is also known as streptococcal pharyngitis, or strep throat. Redness, trouble swallowing, swelling of regional lymph nodes, and localized pain are common complaints of streptococcal pharyngitis. Leukocytosis, an abnormally high white blood level, is a common reaction to the infection. Streptococcal pharyngitis is most prevalent during colder seasons. Many marching bands play on cold nights at football games. Exposing musicians to such weather and bacterium may increase the likelihood of infection.Wannamaker, LW. \\"Differences between streptococcal infections of the throat and of the skin.

The investors invest their money into the portfolio manager's investment policy for future fund growth such as a retirement fund, endowment fund, education fund, or for other purposes. Portfolio managers work with a team of analysts and researchers, and are responsible for establishing an investment strategy, selecting appropriate investments, and allocating each investment properly towards an investment fund or asset management vehicle.  Model  In the 1950s, Harry Markovitz, an American economist, developed the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which is one of the primary portfolio management tools. The CAPM formula calculates the potential return percentage of an investment vehicle based on its vested risk appetite. The formula is: er = rf + Œ≤ (rm - rf), where * er = expected returns *rf = risk free rate * rm = expected market returns * Œ≤ = risk measure  Investors  The goal of an investment manager is to earn a greater return than the given level of risk. This return can be monitored by investors through weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly performance reports shared by the portfolio manager. The manager may set up a performance benchmark or track their investment strategy alongside an index. The investment policy shared by the manager outlines the details such as minimum investment requirements, liquidity provisions, investment strategy, and markets the manager will be actively investing in. Institutional investors include Fund of Hedge Funds, Insurance companies, Endowment funds, and Sovereign Wealth funds. Individual investors include Ultra-High Net Worth Individuals (UHNW) or High Net Worth Individuals (HNW).  Portfolio managers and investment analysts  Portfolio managers are presented with investment ideas by internal buy-side analysts and sell-side analysts from investment banks. It is their job to sift through the relevant information and use their judgment to buy and sell securities. Throughout the day they read reports, talk to company managers, and monitor industry and economic trends, looking for the right company and time to invest the portfolio's capital.Investment Analysis and Portfolio Management A team of analysts and researchers are ultimately responsible for establishing an investment strategy, selecting appropriate investments, and allocating each investment properly for a fund or asset-management vehicle. Portfolio managers make decisions about investment mix and policy, matching investments to objectives, asset allocation for individuals and institutions, and balancing risk against performance. Portfolio management is about strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the choice of debt vs. equity, domestic vs. international, growth vs. safety, and other trade-offs encountered in the attempt to maximize return at a given appetite for risk. In the case of mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), there are two forms of portfolio management: passive and active. Passive management simply tracks a market index, commonly referred to as indexing or index investing. Active management involves a single manager, co-managers, or a team of managers who attempt to beat the market return by actively managing a fund's portfolio through investment decisions based on research and decisions on individual holdings. Closed-end funds are generally actively managed. A portfolio manager risks losing his past compensation if he engages in insider trading; in fact, lawyers at the law firm Davis & Gilbert wrote in an article in a 2014 article in Financial Fraud Law Report that: > \\"Based upon courts current application of New York's faithless servant > doctrine, it is virtually certain that if ... hedge fund ... managers engage > in wrongdoing ... those .. managers will be forced to disgorge all > compensation received during the period the wrongdoing occurred\\". In Morgan Stanley v. Skowron, 989 F. Supp. 2d 356 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), applying New York's faithless servant doctrine, the court held that a hedge fund's portfolio manager engaging in insider trading in violation of his company's code of conduct, which also required him to report his misconduct, must repay his employer the full $31 million his employer paid him as compensation during his period of faithlessness. The court called the insider trading the \\"ultimate abuse of a portfolio manager's position.\\" The judge also wrote: \\"\\"In addition to exposing Morgan Stanley to government investigations and direct financial losses, Skowron's behavior damaged the firm's reputation, a valuable corporate asset.\\"  Systems  The IT infrastructure for a portfolio manager facilitates the delivery of updated prices and market information to allow for trade orders, trade executions and their overall portfolio value. The IT infrastructure, known as a portfolio management system (PMS), include components such as an order management system, execution management system, portfolio valuation, risk, and compliance. A front-back PMS will also include a middle office and back office components such as trade management, pre/post- trade tools, cash management, and net asset value calculations.

The only other service is a public elementary school. Troy began to form in the late 1890s, with the establishment in the area of a Mormon settlement called Nauvoo named after the more famous settlement in Illinois. A post office was opened in 1902, and a formal town was platted in 1910. In 1931, the name of the town was officially changed to Troy, presumably honoring a son of the area's original Mormon settlers, Troy Grinstead. A ferry may have already been serving the Grande Ronde River at the location. The town was always a service center for the surrounding farms and ranches, and a \\"fisherman's getaway paradise\\" in its relative isolation and lack of commercial enterprise. With the arisal of the \\"urban drift\\" in the 1960s, the small town's population dwindled, services which could also be found in nearby Flora closed.

She operated in Palermo harbor towing and acting as cable recovery and salvage vessel. During her stay in Palermo Hackberry installed boom defenses at Catania, Sicily, and operated briefly in the harbor at Naples, Italy. As the pincers were applied to the Axis in Europe, Hackberry took part in the important landings in southern France. Arriving off the beaches 15 August, the ship helped transport garrison troops from the newly-won Alpha beach to Isle du Levant. Hackberry remained in the area as Allied troops pushed forward from the beachhead, coming under fire from German shore batteries 22 August. With the capture of Toulon, the ship returned to her regular duties, clearing away the net and other harbor obstructions.

Hackberry was returned to U.S. custody from lend- lease 21 March 1949 and was sold the same day to France, where she served as Araign√©e. In the summer of 1949, she sailed to Indochina with two small tugs in tow, and in February 1950, she sailed the return trip with Intraitable in tow.

Many of the results which hold for units are also valid for S-units. Definition Let K be a number field with ring of integers R. Let S be a finite set of prime ideals of R. An element x of K is an S-unit if the principal fractional ideal (x) is a product of primes in S (to positive or negative powers). For the ring of rational integers Z one may take S to be a finite set of prime numbers and define an S-unit to be a rational number whose numerator and denominator are divisible only by the primes in S. Properties The S-units form a multiplicative group containing the units of R. Dirichlet's unit theorem holds for S-units: the group of S-units is finitely generated, with rank (maximal number of multiplicatively independent elements) equal to r + s, where r is the rank of the unit group and s = S. S-unit equation The S-unit equation is a Diophantine equation :u + v = 1 with u, v restricted to being S-units of K. The number of solutions of this equation is finite and the solutions are effectively determined using estimates for linear forms in logarithms as developed in transcendental number theory. A variety of Diophantine equations are reducible in principle to some form of the S-unit equation: a notable example is Siegel's theorem on integral points on elliptic curves, and more generally superelliptic curves of the form yn=f(x).

After working as a journalist for the Dallas Times Herald, he has written and published several works about stars of the silent film era. In addition, he has served as an editor on numerous other books. His Richard Barthelmess: A Life in Pictures (2009) was named by the San Francisco Examiner as one of the Top Ten Film Books of 2009.Thomas Gladysz, \\"Top Ten Film Books of 2009,\\" San Francisco Examiner, 15 December 2009 Biography He was born in Fort Worth, Texas, a member of a long-established family among the earliest American settlers in Texas. The Menefee family is honored with an historical marker administered by the Texas Historical Commission. His great-great-grandfather, William Menefee, was one of the signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence from Mexico. William‚Äôs portrait hangs in the San Jacinto Monument in San Jacinto, Texas. Menefee started his writing career in 1979 as a writer and marketing representative for the Dallas Times Herald, working for twelve years during an era characterized by fierce competition with an archrival, the Dallas Morning News. In 1991, the Dallas Morning News bought out the Herald, closed the business, and within weeks, razed the building to the ground. Associates from the Dallas Morning News invited Menefee to join their operation, which combined their circulation with subscribers obtained by their acquisition of the Herald. Menefee took on leadership responsibilities with their locally produced version of Parade Magazine, for which he anonymously contributed many articles. Freelance writer and editor Menefee, like many of his contemporaries, broke away from the newspaper industry in 2003 when failing economics forced many publications to downsize or close altogether. He struck out on his own as a freelance writer, immediately finding success with several books about the silent film era: Sarah Bernhardt in the Theater of Films and Sound Recordings (McFarland, 2003), The First Female Stars: Women of the Silent Era (Greenwood Praeger, 2004), and The First Male Stars: Men of the Silent Era (BearManor Media, 2008). In 2006, Menefee worked for Brown Books Publishing Group, serving as editor on Sonnets by Robert Brown, Slaves to Medicine by Dr. George Beauchamp, and Downtown Dallas: Romantic Past, Modern Renaissance by Mark Rice. That year, he collaborated with Richard Davis on Lilian Hall-Davis: The English Rose, a biography of Britain‚Äôs noted silent film star. In 2007, Menefee embarked on an effort to research stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood. He visited and communicated with major archives around the world in a detailed exploration of archive contents to unearth the materials available for several biographies. In 2008, after amassing enough materials for several books, Menefee began working on multiple projects. He completed some for publication within the following two years. In 2009, Menefee worked for BearManor Media, serving as editor on Best in Hollywood: The Good, The Bad, and the Beautiful by James Best and Jim Clark, Burlesque: A Living History by Jane Briggeman, Johnny Olson: A Voice in Time by Randy West. Also in 2009, Menefee was the author of Richard Barthelmess: A Life in Pictures. In 2010, Menefee shared credit along with William Thomas, Jr. on \\"Otay\\" The Billy \\"Buckwheat\\" Thomas Story. He also edited Tales from the Script by author Gene Perrett, Six Cult Films from the Sixties by author Ib Melchior, Will the Real Me Please Stand Up by author Christopher Knopf, Endless Summer: My Life With The Beach Boys by author Jack Lloyd, Confessions of a Scream Queen by author Matt Beckoff, as well as Now and Then, The Movies Get It Right by Neal Stannard. Early in 2010, Menefee published George O'Brien: A Man's Man in Hollywood, the first full-length biography and filmography of one of Hollywood's most beloved stars. Menefee earned many positive reviews, including one from John Gallagher in the April 2010 National Board of Review: > \\"Menefee has done his research here, accessing the O‚ÄôBrien estate, and > loading the book with great graphics and rare photos.

He also served as editor for actress Marilyn Knowlden's autobiography Little Girl in Big Pictures. Also in 2011, with the creation of Menefee Publishing, Inc., Menefee published Sarah Bernhardt, Her Films, Her Recordings, Charlie O'Doone's Second Chance and Other Stories. In addition, with co-author Robert L. Willis, he launched a new mystery series featuring detective Margot Cranston, including the first four titles, The Secret of the St. Lawrence Lighthouse, The Mystery at Loon Lake, and The Quest for the Jade Dragons. He also published the historical fiction novels, Brothers of the Storm about African American history, and The Remarkable Mr. Messing, about surviving the Holocaust in World War Two. Other works published include The Rise and Fall of Lou-Tellegen, the first biography of actor Lou-Tellegen; and Falling Stars: 10 Who Tried to be a Movie Star. In 2012, his works included Sweet Memories, about the Mary Pickford / Owen Moore romance, and Can't Help Falling in Love (with co-author Carol Dunitz.) Menefee is working on a film project, Triple Crown, a screenplay about the famous jockey Earl Sande, written in collaboration with Richard J. Maturi. ‚ÄúI believe in doing thorough research,‚Äù Menefee said in a recent interview. ‚ÄúFor thirty years, I researched the life and work of Sarah Bernhardt in order to produce the first ever in-depth account of her work in motion pictures and on sound recordings, a part of the Divine Sarah‚Äôs work that most of her biographers tended to skip over.

Directed by Anne Aghion and produced by Gacaca Productions, this 2004 film won an Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Informational Programming.\\" Filmed in Rwanda, the language of In Rwanda is Kinyarwanda with English subtitles. Plot Set in Rwanda, Anne Aghion, the director, interviews a genocide offender who has been released back into his community, and the victims of the genocide. The film follows how at first, the coexistence between the people who instigated the genocide and the victimized people is unbearable. Many of the victims feel rage toward their former oppressors. But gradually, the victims and oppressors start talking to the camera, and then to each other as they start the difficult task of living with each other. The documentary portrays how the people's spirits cannot be crushed by the Rwandan genocide, the 1994 mass killing of hundreds of thousands of Rwanda's minority Tutsis and the moderates of its Hutu majority by the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi.

The station's studios are located in downtown Toledo, and its transmitter is located in Bowling Green, Ohio. History 107.7 first filed for a construction permit in March 1988, and initially assigned the call letters WIZD. However, these call letters were not used and the station went on the air June 1, 1989 as \\"Jumpin' Country 107.7\\" WHMQ, though licensed to North Baltimore, maintained its studios and offices along Tiffin Avenue in Findlay. From 1999 to 2002 callsign was changed to WIMJ and was known as Magic 107.7 with an Oldies format. In 2002 Clear Channel changed the callsign to WPFX-FM and the format was also changed to classic rock as 107.7 The Fox to better target then rival Classic Hits 100.5 WKXA in Findlay. In July 2008, WPFX changed its format classic rock as 107.7 The Fox to Adult contemporary as My 107.7 just before going off the air in August 2008.

Bonny Slope lies on Thompson Road north of Beaverton and northwest of Portland. One of the first businesses in the area was Potter's Mill, founded circa 1900. It was purchased by E.O. Potter in 1903. Fires, including those in 1940 and 1951, devastated forests around the area. The last lumber mill in Bonny Slope was created following the August 1951 fire, and lasted for about six months. During the Prohibition era, illegal moonshine production was rampant in the area. Violet Frost writes in her book The Bonny Slope Story, \\"The logs were stacked to give the appearance of solidity but they concealed a small room. To obtain his liquor, a customer needed only to drive on the bridge, walk around to the trap door, and pick up his supply.\\" The production was eventually exposed and operations shut down. Plank roads had long existed in the community, built in the early 1900s using the lumber from local mills, including Potter's Mill. Several contemporary major roads in Bonny Slope were created due to petitions from residents, such as McDaniel Road in 1928, Thompson Road in 1929, and Laidlaw Road in 1932. Minor roads were only paved in the 1990s, and some remain unpaved to this day.

The closely related field of biomedical informatics is primarily focused on the use of information systems for acquisition and application of patients' medical data, whereas nursing informatics deals with the delivery, administration and evaluation of patient care and disease prevention. What remains unclear, however, is how this emerging discipline should relate to the myriad of previously existing sub specializations within the broad umbrella of health informatics - including clinical informatics (which itself includes sub areas such as oncology informatics), bioinformatics and healthcare management informatics - particularly in light of the proposed \\"fundamental theorem\\" of biomedical informatics posed by Friedman in early 2009. The field of health administration informatics is emerging as attention continues to focus on the costly mistakes made by some health care organizations whilst implementing electronic medical records. Relevance within the health care industry In a recent survey of health care CIOs and Information System (IS) directors, increasing patient safety and reducing medical errors was reported as among the top business issues. Two other key findings were that: * two-thirds of respondents indicated that the number of FTEs in their IT department will increase in the next 12 months; * and three-quarters of respondents indicated that their IT budgets would be increasing. The most likely staffing needs reported by the health care executives are network and architecture support (HIMMS, 2005). ‚ÄúThe government and private insurers are beginning to pay hospitals more for higher quality care‚Äìand the only way to measure quality, and then improve it, is with more information technology. Hospital spending on such gear is expected to climb to $30.5 billion next year, from $25.8 billion in 2004, according to researcher Dorenfest Group‚Äù (Mullaney and Weintraub, 2005). This fundamental change in health care (pay for performance) means that hospitals and other health care providers will need to develop, adapt and maintain all of the technology necessary to measure and improve on quality. Physicians have traditionally lagged behind in their use of technology (i.e., electronic patient records). Only 7% of physicians work for hospitals, and so the task of ‚Äúwooing them is an extremely delicate task‚Äù (Mullaney and Weintraub, 2005). Careers The market demand for a specialized advanced degree that integrates Health Care Administration and Informatics is growing as the concept has gained support from the academic and professional communities. Recent articles in Health Management Technology cite the importance of integrating information technology with health care administration to meet the unique needs of the health care industry. The health care industry has been estimated to be around 10 years behind other industries in the application of technology and at least 10 to 15 years behind in leadership capability from the technology and perhaps the business perspective (Seliger, 2005; Thibault, 2005). This means there is quantifiable demand in the work force for health care administrators who are also prepared to lead in the field of health care administration informatics. In addition, the increasing costs and difficulties involved in evaluating the projected benefits from IT investments are requiring health care administrators to learn more about IT and how it affects business processes. The health care Chief Information Officer (CIO) must be able to build enterprise wide systems that will help reduce the administrative cost and streamline the automation of administrative processes and patient record keeping. Increasingly, the CIO is relied upon for specialized analytical and collaborative skills that will enable him/her to build systems that health care clinicians will use. A recent well-publicized debacle (shelving of a $34 million computer system after three months) at a top U. S. hospital underlines the need for leaders who understand the health care industry information technology requirements (Connolly, 2005). Several professional organizations have also addressed the need for academic preparation that integrates the two specializations addressed by UMUC‚Äôs MSHCAI degree. In the collaborative response to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONCHIT) request for information regarding future IT needs, thirteen major health and technology organizations endorsed a ‚ÄúCommon Framework‚Äù to support health information exchange in the United States, while protecting patient privacy. The response cited the need for continuing education of health information management professionals as a significant barrier to implementation of a National Health Information Network (NHIN) (The Collaborative Response, 2005).

Madhukar: Einssein ‚Äì Klarheit und Lebensfreude durch Advaita, L√ºchow Verlag, 2007  Present activities  Since 1997 Madhukar passes on his knowledge in worldwide events and retreats, traditionally called Satsang (sat = truth, sangha = community). His retreats are focused on self- enquiry (Atma vichara) with the question: ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù and dialogues on nonduality. Madhukar emphasizes that there are close connection between spirituality and the findings of modern science. He says that quantum physics says that a transcendent energy underlies everything existing and that this finding is in harmony with spirituality. This type of philosophy is often called Quantum Woo, Quantum mysticism or pseudoscience. Madhukar says everybody can experience it, because this energy is the essence of the entire universe and of all beings. In this consciousness everything is unity, everything is one.  Philosophical core issue  According to Madhukar the human being is living in the erroneous belief in a real ‚ÄúI‚Äù: ‚ÄúThe human being believes to have freedom of action and to live in an objective world. This perception is limited. In reality each living being is pure consciousness, in which the world subjectively illustrates. With the question ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù the perceived, limited reality can be questioned and pure consciousness (the Self) can be experienced. Doubtless identification with the Self is absolute freedom, over-all love and silent happiness\\".Madhukar: ‚ÄúThe Simplest Way‚Äù, Editions India, 2nd edition, USA & India 2006  Publications  * The Simplest Way, Editions India, 2nd edition, USA & India 2006, * Yoga der Liebe, Ganapati Verlag, 1.Auflage 2009, * Einssein, L√ºchow publishers, 1st edition, Stuttgart, Germany 2007, * Erwachen in Freiheit, L√ºchow publishers, 2nd edition, Stuttgart, Germany 2004, * –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ–π —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±, –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ì–∞–Ω–≥–∞, –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ 2008, 1-–µ –∏–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ, . * La via pi√π semplice, Om Edizioni, Bologna, *, –ò–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ: –ì–∞–Ω–≥–∞, 2009 –≥, * Dialoger med Madhukar, GML Print on Demand AB, 2009, * Najenostavnej≈°a pot do razsvetljenja, Maribor 2013, * Freedom here and now, Music-CD. * Garden of Love, Music-CD by Madhukar & Sofya  References  Sources  * Bittrich, D./Salvesen, C.: Die Erleuchteten kommen.

He is best known for his posthumously published novel Rummelplatz (German for \\"Fairground\\"). The novel was to be part of a Communist Party campaign to establish a new kind of working class literature by encouraging talented labourers to write fiction about their everyday lives. Br√§unig started work on his only novel Rummelplatz in 1960. The novel deals with work in the Soviet owned uranium mines of the Wismut AG and covers the time span from the foundation of the GDR in 1949 to the uprising in East Germany on June 17, 1953. Though the novel clearly shows the author's conviction that Capitalism always ends up in Fascism and therefore Communism is the only chance for mankind, the preprinted chapters of the book were heavily criticized by the 11th plenum of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany as defaming the working class and the Soviet Union. In contrast to official propaganda, Br√§unig portrayed the Wismut miners not as a kind of working-class elite, but as ordinary people struggling to make a living after World War II, spending their spare time in pubs or at the local fairground (\\"Rummelplatz\\") and with little interest in politics. In 2007 the novel was published and nominated for the Leipzig Book Fair Prize. An English translation by Samuel P. Willcocks was published in 2015 by Seagull Books, an imprint of the University of Chicago Press.

Originally it was named Kongl. Elektriska Telegraf-Werket (literally: Royal Electric Telegraph Agency), which was founded in 1853. Its name changed to Kongl. Telegrafverket in 1871, Kungl. Telegrafverket in 1903, the prefix Kungl. () was dropped in 1946 and the name was further modernised to Televerket in 1953. Televerket continued on with its telecommunications monopoly until corporatisation in 1992-1993 when it was renamed Telia, now part of Telia Company. History=19th Century Kongliga Elektriska Telegraf-Werket was founded in 1853 when the first electric telegraph line was established between Stockholm and Uppsala, and was the government agency for telegraph services. From 1871 the company was known as Kongl. Telegrafverket. The first telephone network in Sweden opened in 1880, as a result of an initiative by former Telegrafverket employees. As telecommunm,uhhhytication technology changed, Telegrafverket expanded to include telephone services, but entered the early telephone industry in Sweden as a latecomer. Through securing a national monopoly on long distance telephone lines, it was able with time to control and take over the local networks of quickly growing private telephone companies. Its network, branded Rikstelefon, was supplied with telephones produced by Swedish telephone manufacturers Ericsson. 20th Century Volvo 245 GL station wagon from 1988 in its distinctive hi-vis orange livery used as a service vehicle by Televerket and Telia. The blue cheatline was later added to the exterior in the early-1990s after the corporatisation of Televerket into Telia. While the telecommunications industry in Sweden has always been ostensibly open, Telegrafverket effectively monopolised the market with its purchase of the telephone company Stockholms Allm√§nna in 1918. When Telegrafverket was renamed Televerket in 1953, the parent company and its subsidiaries had a de facto national monopoly because no other companies had the financial or technical resources to compete. Televerket also pioneered mobile telephony in Sweden; it launched Sweden's first manual radiotelephone service, MTA (Mobiltelefonisystem A) in 1956, which was later succeeded by MTB (1962‚Äì1983) and MTD (1971‚Äì1987). On 1 October 1981, Televerket launched the first fully automatic (1G) mobile phone network in the world, called Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT), which eventually superseded the manual MTA, MTB and MTD networks. From 1980 onwards Televerket's de-facto monopoly was eroded with increasing government liberalisation of the industry, as well as early attempts by private companies, most notably and successfully at that period of time by Kinnevik AB, to dismantle said state-sanctioned telecommunications monopoly through its company Comvik. From 1980 the Riksdag enabled legislation that opened the market to allow competitor's telephones to be connected to the network. In 1988 Televerket's subsidiary company Teli, responsible for the design and manufacture of telephones, ceased production. Also that same year, the administration of Swedish television licences, which had until then also been handled by Televerket, was shifted to a new agency called Radiotj√§nst i Kiruna AB. In accordance with the deregulation decision of the Riksdag and its Telecommunications Act of 1 July 1993, Televerket was corporatised as Telia AB, thus making Sweden the first European country to deregulate its telecom market. Televerket in the 21st Century Telegrafverket and Televerket telephones remain highly collectible, and there is now a market for reconditioned phones that can connect to modern networks. Telia has since merged with the Finnish Sonera, and is now known as Telia Company.

He was first Chamberlain, later Equerry to the stadtholder, and equerry to the Princess after her husband's death. Douwe was married to Baroness Carolina Sinoldt gennant Sch√ºtz (whose curiocabinet in The Hague is shown in a picture from 1756) and had a son, Lodewijk Idzard Douwe with her in 1749. After the stadtholder's court moved from Leeuwarden to The Hague during the Orangist Revolution of 1747 at the end of the Second Stadtholderless Period Douwe became very influential in the patronage politics of the regency of the Princess during the first years of the minority of William V, Prince of Orange. His scandalous dealings for his own profit in public offices (he sold the governorship of the Dutch East India Company colony of Ceylon in 1756 for 70,000 guilders, for instance (1999) Juliana Cornelia de Lannoy (1738-1782): ambitieus, vrijmoedig en gevat, Uitgeverij Verloren, , p. 287) helped put the stadtholderate in bad repute. (1995), The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness and Fall, 1477-1806, Oxford University Press, hardback, paperback, p. 1082 This brought about his removal from court after the death of Princess Anne in 1759. Nevertheless, he was made a lieutenant-general in the army of the Dutch Republic, and served as governor of the Barrier Fortress Ieper in the Austrian Netherlands in 1774. Probably because he played a central role in the corrupt practices of the regime of the Stadtholderate he also was the subject of widespread rumors that he had had a liaison with Princess Anne, and even fathered the future stadtholder William V. Except for the uncanny family resemblance between himself and William, Anne's biographer Veronica Baker- Smith thinks there is insufficient ground to believe this rumour. She points out that such rumours are being flung about quite casually for political reasons, and that when a pamphlet was published in 1782, alleging William V's illegitimacy, this was in the middle of the Patriot crisis, and the author was clearly a Patriot partisan. (1995) A Life of Anne of Hanover, Princess Royal, Brill, , pp. 140-141 Late in life Douwe became the protector and lover of the early feminist Etta Palm d'Aelders, whom he apparently taught the skills to set up as a high-class courtesan, and organiser of a political Salon in pre- Revolutionary Paris.

They are characterized by producing fruit bodies (mushrooms) with umbonate caps and rough brown spores. The genus is widely distributed (especially in temperate regions), and contains about 50 species. They are known for a long stipe which continues down into the ground, known as a rooting stipe or pseudorhiza formed as the fruitbody grows up from the subterranean colonized roots well below the organic soil layer. The genus is primarily mycorrhizal but may also be somewhat parasitic on forest trees. Molecular phylogenetic work during the 2000s suggests a close relationship to Galerina. Taxonomy The genus was circumscribed by mycologist Roger Heim in 1931. The name Phaeocollybia is conserved against the earlier but obscure name Quercella. Phaeocollybia means dusky Collybia which actually refers to the brownish spore print in contrast to the white spore print of Collybia in the traditional sense. Description Phaeocollybia is defined as mushrooms, with a glutinous or moist or sometimes dry and innately scaly, conic, umbonate cap, a rooting, cartilaginous to wiry stipe, generally lacking a visible veil or cortina or with faint traces, and spores which are brown in deposit.

Built at Cleveland, Ohio Mango (YN 19) was laid down 18 October 1940 by American Shipbuilding Company, Cleveland, Ohio; launched 22 February 1941; and placed in service 18 September 1941, Lt. H. W. Gaidsick in charge, for passage down the St. Lawrence River to the Portsmouth Navy Yard, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she was fitted out. She arrived off Casco Bay, Portland, Maine, in December to start a year of net laying and acting as gate vessel. Mango commissioned 15 December 1942. World War II service  Mango moved to Boston, Massachusetts, in January 1943. Two months later she steamed for Argentia, Newfoundland, where she continued to serve as gate vessel until 18 August when she returned to the U.S. East Coast, via Sydney and Halifax, Nova Scotia, arriving Boston, Massachusetts, 29 August. By the end of October Mango was underway for Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, to spend 1944 tending nets off the Atlantic Ocean coast of Panama. She was reclassified AN-24 on 20 January 1944. Mango sailed from Mount Hope, Panama Canal Zone, for the Pacific Ocean War Zone late in February 1945. For the next 4 months she alternated escort service with net replacement duties in the triangle of the Admiralty Islands, the Philippines, and New Guinea. The ship departed Samar, Philippines, for Borneo in the middle of June, arriving 24 June to begin marking out the beachhead landing assault path to Balikpapan. Following D-Day, 1 July, she laid out the channel to the harbor. End-of-war activity On 15 July Mango steamed for Samar and was in overhaul when hostilities ceased 15 August. Assigned the removal of the net defenses, she began at Samar 10 September and continued on to Manus, arriving 15 October, to resume operations in the Admiralties until the end of 1945. The net laying ship returned to the Philippines to serve off Leyte from 15 January 1946 until the middle of September. Her net removing tasks took her to Guam, Mariana Islands, and to Eniwetok and Kwajalein in the Marshalls before she arrived Pearl Harbor 15 November.  Post-war decommissioning Mango shortly departed Pearl Harbor for the U.S. West Coast, arriving Astoria, Oregon, 27 January 1947. She decommissioned 4 April 1947 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Columbia River, Oregon. On 1 September 1962 Mango was struck from the Navy List; delivered to the U.S. Maritime Commission the same day; and berthed with the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California, where she remains into 1969.

The survey is administered to community college students during the spring academic term. The survey questions assess institutional practices and student behaviors that are correlated highly with student learning and student retention. The survey serves three purposes for community college administrators and instructors: * benchmarking‚Äîcomparison to national norms on educational practice and performance by community and technical colleges. * diagnosis‚Äîidentification of areas in which an institution could improve students‚Äô educational experiences and outcomes. * monitoring/accountability‚Äîdocumentation and improvement of institutional effectiveness over time.

Nutrition studies focus on these antinutrients commonly found in food sources and beverages.  Examples  Phytic acid has a strong binding affinity to minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, and zinc. This results in precipitation, making the minerals unavailable for absorption in the intestines. Phytic acids are common in the hulls of nuts, seeds and grains and of great importance in agriculture animal nutrition and eutrophication-wise due to the mineral chelation and bound phosphates released into the environment. Without the need to use milling to reduce phytate (including nutrient), the amount of phytic acid is commonly reduced in animal feeds by adding histidine acid phosphate type of phytases to them. Protease inhibitors are substances that inhibit the actions of trypsin, pepsin and other proteases in the gut, preventing the digestion and subsequent absorption of protein. For example, Bowman‚ÄìBirk trypsin inhibitor is found in soybeans. Lipase inhibitors interfere with enzymes, such as human pancreatic lipase, that catalyze the hydrolysis of some lipids, including fats. For example, the anti-obesity drug orlistat causes a percentage of fat to pass through the digestive tract undigested. Amylase inhibitors prevent the action of enzymes that break the glycosidic bonds of starches and other complex carbohydrates, preventing the release of simple sugars and absorption by the body. Amylase inhibitors, like lipase inhibitors, have been used as a diet aid and obesity treatment. Amylase inhibitors are present in many types of beans; commercially available amylase inhibitors are extracted from white kidney beans. Oxalic acid and oxalates are present in many plants and in significant amounts particularly in rhubarb, tea, spinach, parsley and purslane. Oxalates bind to calcium and prevent its absorption in the human body. Glucosinolates prevent the uptake of iodine, affecting the function of the thyroid and thus are considered goitrogens. They are found in plants such as broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, mustard greens, radishes and cauliflower. Excessive intake of required nutrients can also result in them having an anti-nutrient action. Excessive intake of dietary fiber can reduce the transit time through the intestines to such a degree that other nutrients cannot be absorbed. However, this effect is often not seen in practice and reduction of absorbed minerals can be attributed mainly to the phytic acids in fibrous food. Foods high in calcium eaten simultaneously with foods containing iron can decrease the absorption of iron via an unclear mechanism involving iron transport protein hDMT1, which calcium can inhibit. Some proteins can also be antinutrients, such as the trypsin inhibitors and lectins found in legumes. These enzyme inhibitors interfere with digestion. Avidin is an antinutrient found in active form in raw egg whites. It binds very tightly to biotin (vitamin B7) and can cause deficiency of B7 in animals and, in extreme cases, in humans. Widespread form of antinutrients are the flavonoids, which are a group of polyphenolic compounds that include tannins. These compounds chelate metals such as iron and zinc and reduce the absorption of these nutrients, but they also inhibit digestive enzymes and may also precipitate proteins. Saponins in plants may act like antifeedants and can be classified as antinutrients.  Occurrence  Antinutrients are found at some level in almost all foods for a variety of reasons. However, their levels are reduced in modern crops, probably as an outcome of the process of domestication. The possibility now exists to eliminate antinutrients entirely using genetic engineering; but, since these compounds may also have beneficial effects, such genetic modifications could make the foods more nutritious but not improve people's health. Many traditional methods of food preparation such as germination, fermentation, cooking, and malting increase the nutritive quality of plant foods through reducing certain antinutrients such as phytic acid, polyphenols, and oxalic acid. Such processing methods are widely used in societies where cereals and legumes form a major part of the diet. An important example of such processing is the fermentation of cassava to produce cassava flour: this fermentation reduces the levels of both toxins and antinutrients in the tuber.

Like other Junkers types, it was an all- metal, low-wing cantilever monoplane. Compared to modern aircraft, only the corrugated duralumin metal skin, so typical for Junkers aircraft, seems unusual. However, in the mid-1920s all-metal construction and an aerodynamically 'clean' configuration were remarkable. Development Professor Junkers wanted to follow up on the commercial success of the tri- motor G 24 with a new design that would be larger, more comfortable for passengers, and simpler to operate and maintain.Wolfgang Wagner \\"Hugo Junkers Pionier der Luftfahrt ‚Äì Seine Flugzeuge\\" Bernard & Graefe Verlag, Bonn 1996 (in German) The G 31 was the first Luft Hansa airliner to feature a flight attendant (Wagner p. 264), who served food and drinks (which were not complimentary). This earned the G 31 the nickname 'flying dining car' ('fliegender Speisewagen' in German). Because of its large fuselage it was also called the flying moving van ('fliegender M√∂belwagen' in German). Behind the cockpit were compartments for a radio operator, baggage and an APU that provided compressed air for main engine starting and drove a generator for electric power.Karl-Dieter Seifert\\"Der Deutsche Luftverkehr 1926 ‚Äì 1945 auf dem Weg zum Weltverkehr\\" Bernard & Graefe Verlag, Bonn 1999 (in German) The cabin was divided into three compartments that held eleven regular passenger seats, four jumpseats for passengers, a jumpseat for the steward, and an enclosed lavatory. Instead of the passenger seats, ten beds could be made up for night flying. There was a baggage and freight hold under the cabin. The wings had trailing edge flaps that reduced the landing speed by ten percent (Wagner p. 267). Professor Junkers originally requested the G 31 have landing gear that would retract into the wings. After extensive wind tunnel experiments Ernst Zindel, the leader of the design team, persuaded Professor Junkers that the gain in speed provided by reduced air resistance, would not outweigh the increased weight, cost and complexity of either retractable landing gear or simple wheel fairings. The tailskid incorporated a roller, to avoid damage to grass airfields(Wagner p. 262‚Äì263). The intended powerplant was three Junkers L5 engines. When these proved too weak, it was suggested to use the Napier Lion, considered to be the best aero engine at the time (\\"the best engine for the best plane\\"). This however was too expensive, especially since it would have had to be paid for in convertible currency, not German Reichsmark. Most G 31s flew with foreign air-cooled radial engines in the 500 hp range, which were licence-built in Germany (see list of variants below)(Wagner p. 265‚Äì267). Operational history Originally, the G 31 had been intended to equip Junkers' own airline, Junkers Luftverkehr, but this venture was merged into Deutsche Luft Hansa in 1926, and the new airline purchased only eight G 31s, beginning operations in May 1928. They were used on the long-range routes of Luft Hansa, particularly to Scandinavia. They continued in this role until 1935, when replaced by the Junkers Ju 52. Four other G 31s were sold for freighting cargo in New Guinea. Operated by Guinea Airways, one was owned by the airline itself, while the other three were owned by the Bulolo Gold Dredging Company. Powered by Pratt & Whitney Hornets, these differed from the G 31 airliners in having open cockpits, and a large hatch in the fuselage roof to accommodate the loading of bulky cargo via crane.Grant 1998, pp. 49‚Äì51. In one particular operation, the G 31s were used to airlift eight 3,000 tonne (3,310 ton) dredges (in parts) from Lae to Bulolo. Three of the aircraft were destroyed in a Japanese air raid on Bulolo on 21 January 1942, and the remaining aircraft was pressed into RAAF service ten days later. This machine (construction number 3010, registration VH-UOW) was seriously damaged in an accident at Laverton, Victoria on 31 October that year after it careened off the runway and collided with and destroyed the Minister for Air's car.\\"Junkers G31go VH-UOW ‚Äì Guinea Airways\\". The Airways Museum & Civil Aviation Historical Society. Retrieved 17 October 2010.\\"RAAF A44 Junkers G31 & W34\\". ADF Aircraft Serial Numbers. 20 May 2009. Retrieved 17 October 2010. Although judged beyond repair by the Air Force, it eventually returned to freighter use in New Guinea for some time after the war. Unlike the earlier Junkers G 24, the G 31 was not a commercial success, only 13 being sold, as opposed to 54 civilian G 24s (+30 military derivatives)(Wagner p. 267). Compared to the G 24 it offered passengers more comfort. Compared to the more usual biplane airliners of the 1920s, the G 31 was faster, and its all-metal construction made it safer. However purchase price and operating costs were high. Instead of the newly designed G 31, a developed version of the G 24 might have sold better.

It takes its name from a medieval field-name of Easthampstead parish, which it was previously in. Building of the estate began around 1967 as the town continued to expand. The estate lies approximately south-west of the town centre, to the west of the A3095 road. Great Hollands is in two wards, Great Hollands North and Great Hollands South. Facilities include a shopping centre, library, community centre, the William Twigg public house and Great Hollands Primary School . There are a number of light industrial units near the shopping centre. History The development of Great Hollands neighbourhood was originally closely linked with the growth of the Bracknell company, Sperry, which was at the time Bracknell's largest employer. The only memory now left of this company is the concrete gyroscope, which is situated on one of the roundabouts on the Wokingham Road, opposite which Sperry's main building once stood. The site is now the Arlington Square Complex. In the mid 1960s Sperry built an extension to its Bracknell factory so that the work of its Brentford branch could be transferred here. Houses were needed for employees, and, as a result, the development of Great Hollands neighbourhood had to be pushed ahead faster than was originally intended. The first houses were completed in 1967 but the acceleration in the building of the houses led to a longer than usual wait for the provision of other services and facilities. Great Hollands was, at that time, the furthest neighbourhood from the town and the bus service was somewhat inadequate. Some of the first people to move to Great Hollands complained of the delay in the provision of a primary school, shops (especially a chemist) and public telephones. Temporary shops were provided (two houses in Abbotsbury were used - one a Londis store, and the other a newsagent). A community centre was improvised in converted premises (East Lodge). The population of Great Hollands had passed the 3000 mark before the neighbourhood centre known today began to take shape. Sixteen shops opened during 1971, followed somewhat later by the William Twigg public house and, later still, by a primary school. In its fully developed form, Great Hollands has a number of features which distinguish it from some of Bracknell's original housing estates. There was a large proportion of private housing built. The neighbourhood centre was planned more comprehensively and included a small amount of light industry. The primary school, a community centre and a branch of the library were all constructed. In 1976 the town's first purpose- built health centre opened its doors in the Great Hollands neighbourhood centre. Traffic segregation, which was originally started when Wildridings was constructed, was considerably extended along the same lines in Great Hollands. The neighbourhood streets branched off a circular road called Ringmead and they were all named in alphabetical order: Abbotsbury, Ambassador, Appledore and so on ending with Yardley. Many of the names were very familiar ones to the Londoners who moved here as they were the old names of the London telephone exchanges.

He is the father of the actor Jean-Paul Belmondo. Biography  Belmondo was born in Algiers into a poor family of Italian origin (Piedmont and Sicily). His early schooling was at Dordor in Algiers. Passionate about art and design, he began carving at the age of 13 years. He studied architecture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Algiers, but his studies were interrupted by the First World War. He was gassed at the Battle of Saint- Mihiel, and was then demobilized. Thanks to a grant from the government of Algeria, he continued his studies in Paris where he became the student, then the friend, of Charles Despiau and Jean Boucher. He won the Grand Prix de Rome and Prix Blumenthal in 1926. He married Sarah Madeleine Rainaud-Richard in Paris in 1930. Three children were born to the marriage, Alain-Paul (1931), Jean-Paul (1933), and Muriel (1945). He received the Grand Prix artistique of Algeria in 1932 and then the Grand Prix of the city of Paris in 1936.Paul Belmondo, la sculpture sereine During World War II he was a member of Groupe Collaboration, which advocated collaboration with the Nazi authorities. He was vice-president of the arts section (1941‚Äì1945). In 1941 he participated in a \\"study tour\\" organized by Goebbels in Germany, in which French painters and sculptors visited German cultural sites and art workshops. However, Paul Belmondo was not \\"worried\\" after the Liberation since many other well-known artists had also participated. Before the war, he received many orders from the state, including the Palais de Chaillot with Leo-Ernest Drivier and Marcel Gimond. He became a professor at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts de Paris in 1956 and a member of the Institute in 1960. Death He died, aged 83, on 1 January 1982 in Paris. He is buried in Montparnasse Cemetery. His workshop was located in old stables, at the Avenue Denfert-Rochereau in Paris. Work Belmondo's work continues the neoclassical academic style, seeking harmonious forms with simple lines and smooth surfaces. He also made medals and illustrations for art books, including Georges Courteline's Boubouroche. Two bronzes, Jeannette and Apollo, have been located in the Tuileries Palace Gardens since 1988 (donated by the Belmondo family); the family donated another copy of Jeannette to the World Intellectual Property Organization on 9 September 1986 for the centennial of the Berne Convention. When Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux's sculpture Dance was moved from the exterior of Opera Garnier, Belmondo made the replacement for the original location. A retrospective exhibition of his work, entitled \\"The sculpture of serenity\\", was organized in several cities in France from 1997 at the initiative of the Ministry of Culture.Paul Belmondo : La sculpture sereine, ouvrage collectif, √©ditions Somogy, 2001. The National Museum of Fine Arts in Algiers has a large collection of sculptures by Belmondo. Mus√©e Paul Belmondo In March 2007 Jean-Paul Belmondo, his brother Alain and his sister Muriel donated all works of their father they owned to the Paris suburb Boulogne-Billancourt: 259 sculptures, 444 medals and almost 900 drawings as well as sketchbooks and preparatory work.Une folie du XVIIIe si√®cle pour abriter le mus√©e, Le Figaro Magazine, 30 novembre 2007 Emmanuel Br√©on, curator of the Mus√©e des Ann√©es Trente (Museum of the 1930s) in Boulogne-Billancourt had proposed that a museum dedicated to Paul Belmondo could be located in the area. The Belmondo collection was temporarily stored in the Mus√©e des Ann√©es Trente. The new museum was built in Buchillot castle, an eighteenth-century folly. The building, a historic monument, owned by the city, was renovated for a sum of over 2.7 million euros. It was initially expected to open at the end of 2008,\\"Au nom du p√®re\\": Interview with Jean-Paul Belmondo and Michel Godest by V√©ronique Prat, Le Figaro Magazine, 30 november 2007. but was delayed until 2010, opening to the public on 14 September 2010. The Architectural Review discussed the design, writing that: > The designers describe the first space as 'a setting of the utmost serenity > possible' where a ‚Äòsmooth, otherworldly luminescence‚Äô is created through a > diffusion of natural and hidden artificial lighting.

Despite its name, it did not use a jet pack as such, but ducted fans for lift. Martin Aircraft Company of New Zealand (not related to Glenn L. Martin Company, the US company also known as Martin Aircraft) developed it, and they unveiled it at the Experimental Aircraft Association's 2008 AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, US. The US Federal Aviation Administration classified it as an experimental ultralight airplane. It used a gasoline (petrol) engine with two ducted fans to provide lift. It was specified to have a maximum speed of , a flight ceiling of , a range of and endurance of about 28 minutes flight. Empty weight was . The first customers were hoped to be first responders. In 2019, the company closed. History The Martin Jetpack was under development for over 30 years. Glenn Neal Martin (not to be confused with Glenn L. Martin, of US Martin Aircraft) started work on it in his Christchurch garage in the 1980s. New Zealand aviation regulatory authorities approved the Martin Jetpack for a limited set of manned flight tests in 2013. , the price of the commercial production units was hoped to be Glenn Martin suddenly resigned on 4 June 2015 after investing 30 years in the product. In August 2016, CEO Pete Coker was replaced by the former CFO James West. The company closed its doors in 2019, with KuangChi Science, Martin Aircraft's 52% majority shareholder, looking for a buyer for the few remaining assets. Description The Martin Jetpack is a small VTOL device with two ducted fans that provide lift and a V4 piston gasoline engine. Although its pilot straps onto it and does not sit, the device cannot be classed as a backpack device because it is too large to be worn while walking. However, the Martin Jetpack does not meet the Federal Aviation Administration's classification of an ultralight aircraft: it meets weight and fuel restrictions, but it cannot meet the power-off stall speed requirement. The intention is to create a specific classification for the jetpack it uses the same petrol used in cars, is relatively easy to fly, and is cheaper to maintain and operate than other ultralight aircraft. Most helicopters require a tail rotor to counteract the rotor torque, which, along with the articulated head complicate flying, construction, and maintenance enormously. The Martin Jetpack is designed to be torque neutral it has no tail rotor, no collective, no articulating or foot pedals and this design simplifies flying dramatically. Pitch, roll and yaw are controlled by one hand, height by the other. Version P12 A further version of the Martin Jetpack was built to prepare for manned flight testing. The new prototype, with the descriptor P12, had several design improvements over earlier versions, including lowering the position of the Martin Jetpack's ducts, which reportedly resulted in better maneuverability. It also had a fully integrated fly by wire system. P12 was to be developed into a First Responder production model. A lighter personal jetpack was hoped to be available in 2017. Safety features In order to enhance safety, the finished product will feature a low opening ballistic parachute along with carbon fibre landing gear and pilot module.Martin Aircraft, News, accessdate=12 November 2015 Flight testing On 29 May 2011, the Martin Jetpack successfully completed a remotely controlled unmanned test flight to above sea level, and carried out a successful test of its ballistic parachute. A second version, designated prototype P12, of the Martin Jetpack received approval from the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to begin manned flight testing in August 2013. According to an investor update from August 2016, additional funding will be required to complete the certification process. Potential markets In 2015, the company as part of its listing on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX:MJP) stated that the jetpack could be available on the market in late 2016; it was expected to sell for approximately . However, the delivery date was again postponed. Governments were expected to be a large share of initial consumers. The first production model was aimed at military and first responder emergency crews, such as police, firefighters, and medical personnel, to enable them to have faster response times, to reach areas inaccessible by road, and to get to the top of tall buildings quickly. Interested buyers included the government of the United Arab Emirates; it was reported in November 2015 that Dubai (part of the UAE) had placed an initial order for twenty units, simulators, and training, for delivery in 2016.

His father was Henry Allen, a steel mark maker, and his mother, Elizabeth Epworth Allen (n√©e Blacktin). Epworth was the maiden name of Elizabeth's mother, who was also called Elizabeth. Allen showed remarkable artistic talent from an early age and, in 1902, won third prize for pen and ink drawing in an art studentship competition run by the Sheffield Weekly Independent. Between 1907 and 1911, he attended the King Edward VII School in Sheffield, where he obtained a Lower School Certificate Prize for his class distinctions in Arithmetic, Scripture and English. In 1911, he began work as a clerk in the steel works owned by Arthur Balfour and in 1912 he enrolled at the Sheffield Technical School of Art.

Also, most contemporaneous historical epics used a star to focus on grand historical characters.as stated by Richard Pena of the Film Society of Lincoln Center at the beginning of the screening This film focuses on a character whom nobody knows or will ever know; a patriot riding to get the assistance of Giuseppe Garibaldi.

The film also uses non-actors (a key element of Italian neorealism) and a rarity for its time and era.

Operated by the Bergen County Parks Department, the park is home to the Bergen County Zoological Park. In addition, the park features picnic areas, a baseball field, a softball field, basketball and tennis courts, a soccer field, a playground, a carousel, and pony rides. The zoo is open all year round, and charges admission from May to October. The zoo also features a ridable miniature railroad known as the Safari Express. The park, most notably the zoo, was slated for a major expansion as of 2016, which would nearly double the size of the zoo from 12 to 23 acres and significantly diversify its population of animal species, as well as add an ice-skating rink and expand automobile parking capacity at the park by hundreds of spaces. History The zoo opened in 1960. Its railroad, the Van Saun Park Railroad, was first built in 1963 and features three trains: the 388 train, which accompanied the opening, the 389 train, purchased in 1968, and the 520, added to the lineup in 1971. The train models are Iron Horse S-24 narrow-gauge trains by the Allan Herschell Company. The train is open from Tuesdays through Sundays (weather permitting) and closed Mondays for maintenance, unless it falls on a holiday, between April and October. The train passengers view the many different attractions in the zoo while going through railroad crossings and a tunnel. The train is also open during the Bergen County's Winter Wonderland event, which runs from November through January. The carousel was built in 2000, when the park built a new train station, a new entrance, and a discovery center for animals. The carousel features horses and other zoo animals as seats. The carousel is open every day except Tuesdays for maintenance. The carousel is also available from April to October as well. The carousel has been controversial since almost all the money earned was kept by the contract owner. Ever since the Golden Horse Carousel at Paramus Park closed in 2013 and the Venetian Carousel at Garden State Plaza closed in 2016, this carousel at Van Saun Park is the last remaining operating carousel in the entire borough of Paramus. The carousel is also open during the Bergen County's Winter Wonderland event, which runs from November through January. The pony rides are open from April to October too. Riders are taken around a small track where the pony is pulled by an employee. The playground and athletic fields are open all year round as well. In 2013, Van Saun opened up a dog park. It consists of two areas. One area is for smaller dogs and the other area is for larger dogs. Dog run opening at Van Saun Park in Paramus - Cliffview Pilot.

Franklin. It continues to serve the black community of Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas. Before 1827, when the African-American newspaper Freedom's Journal was founded in New York City, there were no black-owned and operated newspapers. News of their community was not generally covered by white journalists, and the mainstream press expressed bias against blacks. This reduced communication both within and outside the communities. Black publications have struggled to survive, given difficulties in financing. With the majority of black population in the South until the 20th-century Great Migrations, Northern blacks were not served by Southern papers. Founder  Chester Arthur Franklin, or \\"C.A.,\\" (1880‚Äì1955) founded The Call newspaper in May 1919 in Kansas City, Missouri. He owned and operated it until his death on May 7, 1955, establishing an office also in Kansas City, Kansas. Franklin was born in Texas on June 7, 1880, the only child of George F. Franklin, a barber, and Clara Belle (n√©e Williams) Franklin, a teacher. Tired of racial segregation and disfranchisement of minorities in Texas, his family moved to Omaha, Nebraska and eventually to Denver, Colorado in search of opportunities. There Chester worked for his father, who owned local newspapers in both cities. Eventually Franklin took over Denver‚Äôs The Star for his father; he printed, edited, and distributed the paper until 1913. That year, Franklin decided to move to Kansas City, Missouri, having heard about its growing African-American population and vibrant music and culture. Franklin intended to start up a paper and gain a larger audience within Missouri and Kansas. He set up his own printing shop before organizing to publish his own newspaper. His mother had accompanied him and his family. Franklin launched The Call and sold copies for 5 cents; his mother helped by peddling subscriptions door to door. Franklin taught himself how to use the Linotype machine, because white union workers were not allowed to assist blacks. He developed the newspaper, and The Call became one of the six largest African-American weeklies in the country, and one of the largest black-owned and operated businesses in the Midwest. ‚ÄúDuring its first eight years, The Call grew steadily from a circulation of about 2,000 in 1919 to 16,737 in 1927, and then remained at that level until the late 1930s‚Äù. The newspaper employed (and still employs) many African Americans in the Kansas City community. Franklin's vision Franklin wanted to develop a paper that empowered and gave a voice to the black community, while being free of sensationalism. He advocated developing self-reliance within the community, siding strongly with the philosophy of W.E.B. Dubois. In The Call, he included news and announcements of the local community, including celebrations such as graduations and graduates, and life passages such as deaths and memorials. He wanted the community to know and celebrate itself; their lives were reflected in his paper, instead of being ignored. Advertising promoted black businesses. Local and national news editorials gave a black perspective on certain events. Franklin also included police reports and coverage of crimes, but some readers protested having negative news covered in the African-American community. They wrote letters urging more positive stories; Franklin responded that ‚Äúthe press is to publish, not suppress news‚Ä¶‚Äù. his coverage included treatment of the community's religious life, from features and advertisements for pastors and formal church events, to news of potlucks. Franklin and Harry Truman Franklin built a regional circulation, and enjoyed good advertising support from the business community. Franklin was a deeply committed conservative Republican, who slashed away every week at the corrupt Pendergast machine. However he was on good terms with one of Pendergast's top associates, Harry Truman. Franklin admired Truman's honesty and integrity--indeed that was the reason Pendergast promoted Truman, since he needed to appease the good government forces.Gene Schmidtlein, \\"Harry S. Truman and the Pendergast Machine.\\" Midcontinent American Studies Journal 7#.2 (1966): 28-35. Online Truman was a rare Democrat who gave significant support for the black community, so Franklin recommend voting for him in the 1934 and 1940 Senate elections. The two broke politically in 1941 over domestic issues; Franklin refused to join most black leaders in switching to the Democratic Party. However Franklin's cordial dealings with Truman over the years encouraged Truman to announce his unexpectedly strong support for civil rights in 1948.Thomas D. Wilson, \\"Chester A. Franklin and Harry S. Truman: An African-American Conservative and the ‚ÄòConversion‚Äô of the Future President.\\" Missouri Historical Review 88 (1993): 48-76. Relevance The Call building, December 2016 For 98 years The Call has addressed many civil rights issues, some specific to the African- American community of Kansas City, and others related to conditions in the Midwest and the United States as a whole. Franklin urged blacks to register and vote. During the 1950s, his editorials in The Call‚Äôs protested urban development in inner Kansas City that seemed designed to keep blacks segregated from whites, who began to move into new suburban developments in the 1950s and 60s following construction of highways for commuters. The paper condemned the building of urban projects that displace longtime residents and broke up working communities. He criticized the Housing Authority for their policies and the gentrification of black neighborhoods. Kansas City schools were largely segregated. Lucile Bluford worked on this issue, especially in the case of Lloyd Gaines. Bluford and Gaines were both rejected from furthering their education based on the color of their skin, and both Bluford and Franklin used The Call as a platform for defending their cause. This included encouraging readers to donate to the NAACP. The Call provides empowerment and the avocation of self-reliance to improve the African-American community. The Call always believed firmly in reporting honestly and fairly, and that included their circulation statistics. Because of this, it was the first African-American newspaper admitted to the Alliance for Audited Media (formerly \\"Audit Bureau of Circulations\\"). Additionally, it was the first African-American newspaper to become an International News Service member in 1948 when it subscribed to one of the major wire services. Alumni *Roy Wilkins, a reporter and managing editor from 1923-1931, who later wrote for NAACP's The Crisis and became executive director of the NAACP. *Frank A.

What kind of history it was that Strabo alludes to, is uncertain.

Welburn (born December 14, 1950) is an automobile designer and former General Motors' Vice President of Global Design, a role in which he served from 2003 to 2016 and the same position that Harley Earl and Bill Mitchell once held. To date, Welburn still holds the distinction of having been the highest-ranking African-American in the global automotive industry. He has overseen the development of recent GM products, such as the Chevrolet Corvette, Cadillac Escalade and Chevrolet Camaro. Recent groundbreaking concepts overseen by Welburn include the Oldsmobile Aerotech, Cadillac Ciel, and Buick Avista. Oldsmobile Aerotech Welburn was also the lead GM designer on the Chaparral 2X Vision GT, a concept car designed for the videogame Gran Turismo 6.http://gmauthority.com/blog/2014/12/chaparral-2x-now-available-for- download-in-gran-turismo-6-online- marketplace/http://www.topspeed.com/cars/car-news/chevrolet- chaparral-2x-concept-is-now-available-on-gran-turismo-6-ar166727.html The car features 4-wheel steer and active aerodynamics, claimed to be similar to a wingsuit, and was made available in December 2014. Education Welburn studied design, sculpture, and painting at Howard University‚Äôs School of Fine Arts in Washington, D.C. He communicated with General Motors during his years at Howard, which led to an internship at GM Design after his junior year in 1971. He earned his bachelor's degree from Howard in 1972 and was invited to return to his alma mater on May 7, 2016 to give a commencement speech to graduates of the College of Fine Arts. Career Welburn's first peek behind the curtain of General Motors Design was during his college internship in 1971. One year later, he became the first African American hired to design GM vehicles. He spent his entire design career at GM, where he worked in a variety of studios on a diverse list of vehicles, and he became the highest- ranking African American in the automotive industry as the first-ever Vice President, GM Global Design.https://www.welburndesign.com/product/public/us/en/welburn/bio.html His designs have set records for speed on racetracks and sales in the marketplace. Among many other notable vehicles, he designed multiple pace cars for the Indianapolis 500, and led the design of the presidential limo, commonly known as 'The Beast', for both Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump.https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/23777/brand-new-beast- presidential-limousine-emerges-during-trumps-visit-to-nyc As the leader of GM Global Design, Welburn traveled the world attending auto shows and visiting his eleven design studios in seven countries, averaging 140,000 air miles each year. Throughout his career, Welburn recognized a connection between fashion and automobile design. This kinship brought him to spearhead the creation of three automotive fashion shows; two in Detroit, and a third in Dubai. In these shows, GM's latest concept cars rolled down the runway alongside Hollywood and music industry celebrities wearing the latest fashions. On April 7, 2016, he announced his retirement from General Motors after 44 years, effective July 1, 2016. He was succeeded by Michael Simcoe from GM Australia Design. After announcing his retirement, he launched The Welburn Group, a design consultancy.http://welburngroup.com/ Welburn continues to advise GM Design on the development of their new design facility in Warren, MI. Film and Television Welburn has enjoyed a long relationship with the film industry, with the goal being to ensure GM products are placed in key roles in feature films. He notes his relationship with director Michael Bay, Paramount Pictures, and The Transformers (film series) movies featuring the Bumblebee Camaro as having been the most satisfying. His work on this modern-day film franchise led to a speaking role in Transformers: Age of Extinction. He has also appeared on several automotive TV programs, including AmeriCarna, Jay Leno's Garage, and the automotive reality series Motor City Masters, where his weekly role was that of the authority on design and brands. Charitable and Automotive Heritage Affiliations Welburn serves an active role as a judge of classic cars at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance, Hilton Head Island Motoring Festival & Concours d‚ÄôElegance, and The Peninsula Classic. He also serves on the Board of Directors for the College for Creative Studies, America On Wheels, LeMay - America's Car Museum, and Tony Bennett‚Äôs Exploring the Arts. Personal life Welburn comes from a close-knit family with roots in suburban Philadelphia. It was during a visit to the Philadelphia Auto Show as an 8-year-old that he decided he wanted a career in automotive design, and his mission to become an automotive designer for General Motors took on greater meaning when he wrote his first letter to GM at age 11. The company wrote back and recommended the steps he needed to take to achieve his dream. In a July 7, 2016 interview with John McElroy on the program Autoline, Welburn stated that although officially retired, he has begun the process of writing an autobiography, in addition to having been asked by General Motors CEO Mary Barra to oversee a number of future General Motors products. He is married to his wife, Jessie, and has two adult children and two grandchildren. Awards In 2014, Welburn's passion for fashion landed him on Hour Detroit‚Äôs annual Best Dressed list.https://www.hourdetroit.com/detroit-bests/2014-best-dressed-list/ In 2016, General Motors dedicated its Center for African American Art at the Detroit Institute of Arts in Welburn's honor. The Detroit Free Press also honored him with its first-ever Difference Makers Lifetime Achievement Award, and most recently his body of work was turned over to the Smithsonian Institution museum, making him the first automobile designer to earn that distinction. In 2017, Welburn was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts by the College for Creative Studies, a leading design school, and he was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame, a recognition that he holds as his highest professional honor.https://autoweek.com/article/people/ed-welburn- receives-doctorate-fine-arts-after-retirement In 2018, he received the EyesOn Design Lifetime Design Achievement Award for his outstanding career in vehicle design.https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2018/06/22/eyeson-design-honors-ed- welburn-with-lifetime-achievement-award/ References Living people 1950 births American automobile designers African- American people ","title":"Edward T.

It was designed by the Army's own Technisches und Administratives Milit√§r-Komitee (TMK) in an effort to quickly satisfy the demand from the front for a light mortar. It had a number of issues with its ammunition, namely the black powder used as a propellant gave off copious smoke clouds on firing that revealed the tube's location and the mortar bomb fuzes had a high rate of failure. The breech-loading mortar tube was mounted on a framework that didn't allow for any traverse, which meant that it was impossible to engage different targets without relaying the mortar. In turn the frame was mounted a rectangular firing platform. The M 14/16 had a circular platform to provide traverse and weighed only . A later model allowed the mounting to be collapsed for ease of transport. A new M 16 mortar bomb that used the German Poppenberg fuze system generally cured the dud problem, but it still used black powder as its propellant. This was a severe tactical disadvantage and it was decided to purchase replacement mortars from the German firm of Heinrich Lanz from 1917. References * Ortner, M. Christian.

Unlike non-degenerate semiconductors, these kind of semiconductor do not obey law of mass action, which relates intrinsic carrier concentration with temperature and bandgap. At moderate doping levels the dopant atoms create individual doping levels that can often be considered as localized states that can donate electrons or holes by thermal promotion (or an optical transition) to the conduction or valence bands respectively. At high enough impurity concentrations the individual impurity atoms may become close enough neighbors that their doping levels merge into an impurity band and the behavior of such a system ceases to show the typical traits of a semiconductor, e.g. its increase in conductivity with temperature. On the other hand, a degenerate semiconductor still has far fewer charge carriers than a true metal so that its behavior is in many ways intermediary between semiconductor and metal. Many copper chalcogenides are degenerate p-type semiconductors with relatively large numbers of holes in their valence band. An example is the system LaCuOS1‚àíxSex with Mg doping. It is a wide gap p-type degenerate semiconductor. The hole concentration does not change with temperature, a typical trait of degenerate semiconductors. Another well known example is indium tin oxide. Because its plasma frequency is in the IR-range it is a fairly good metallic conductor, but transparent in the visible range of the spectrum.

Production was slow to ramp up and only ten weapons could be delivered in January 1918. The first large deliveries were made in March 1918, but the raw materials crisis and strained production facilities hindered the TMK's plan to produce 2730 mortars by October 1918. It was a breech-loading smooth-bore weapon that used a shotgun-like break-action to open the breech. This was arranged so that the barrel returned to the proper elevation to speed up the rate of fire. The carriage was mounted on a small metal rectangular firing platform with four carrying handles that permitted some amount of traverse. In Czech service the mortar was known as the 9 cm Lehky minomet vz. 17 and the German designation for captured Yugoslav mortars was 9cm Granatwerfer 309(j).

He is best known as the founder and frontman for the group Height With Friends. Before forming Height With Friends, he released three solo albums and six EPs between 2000 and 2009. Keech interviews artists and musicians on his weekly podcast Height Zone World, which debuted in July 2014. History=Wounds Height began rapping in the Baltimore-based Wounds, a five man group with Jones, Mickey Free, Shields and Chris Freeland. After releasing two cassette-only EP's, Wounds released one self-titled full length album in December 1999. They did a two-week tour in June 2000. Wounds continued occasionally playing shows around the east coast until 2001, when they disbanded as a live act. Self-Titled Solo Debut and Tour In August 2000, Height joined the indie hip-hop group Dogg and Pony, for their tour with San Francisco punk band The Deepthroats. Height wrote part of his first solo album during the tour, and the members of Dogg and Pony offered to put out the album on Dogg Pony Records. Shortly after the tour, Height did his first solo show, opening for Animal Collective at The Cooler in Brooklyn. The first Height album was recorded in September 2000. Production was handled by all members of the Wounds crew, with vocal assistance by Grand Buffet, The Plural MC and MC Dogg. The album was supported by a six-week tour with Grand Buffet in November and December 2000. Due to internal strife at the label, the album ended up not coming out in time for the tour. Height did another midwestern tour with Jones in August 2001. After that tour, Height went on a hiatus from solo shows. He occasionally performed as a hype man for Cex, but he didn't play his own material again for over a year. In October 2002, Height was featured on three tracks from Cex's Tall, Dark and Handcuffed, on Tigerbeat6 Records. This was the first nationally distributed record of which Height was a part. I Have A Gun/Bow and Height In July 2003, Height released his second album, I Have A Gun. The production was handled almost entirely by Shields, with recording and mixing by Zach Poff. Height did one solo tour to promote the album. Shortly after, Height joined Mickey Free (a.k.a. Bow n' Arrow) to form Bow and Height. They became a duo, performing each other's solo songs, as well as some new collaborations. They did five tours throughout 2004, touring the US and Canada with Dan Deacon, Lost It, Grand Buffet and Oxes. In December 2004, Bow and Height disbanded. Height returned to performing as a solo act, starting with a northeastern tour with Dan Deacon. Solo Touring In February 2005, Height set out on a 50-day tour with Dan Deacon. Halfway through the trip, Height's car was totaled in Fresno, California. He flew back to Baltimore, while Dan Deacon completed part of the tour by Greyhound bus. They met up again in Pittsburgh, where they completed the last ten days of the tour together, along with Mickey Free. In the fall of that year, Jones became an occasional part of Height's live set, DJing and adding effects to Height's vocals. Jones would join on for two out of the five Height tours that occurred throughout 2005-2006. Round Robin Tours In October 2006, Height toured as part of the Wham City Round Robin Tour, once again with Jones as DJ. In 2008, toured again as part of The Baltimore Round Robin tour, this time with Jones and King Rhythm as his band mates. Since 2006, Height has been putting together an annual event called the All Rap Round Robin, in Baltimore. Utility Fog In Fall 2006, Height released a short-run EP of rarities, called Utility Fog. He would go on to release four EP's in the Utility Fog series, releasing the final EP of the series in 2009. Winterize The Game In February 2007, Height released the full length album, Winterize The Game, on Grand Man Records. This was the first Height album to be recorded and mixed entirely by Mickey Free. During this time, Jones had become a full-time part of the live show. He joined Height for three coast-to-coast US tours, a Canadian tour, two east coast tours, and many regional other local /regional shows. For two of those tours, King Rhythm was also part of the show, triggering samples live and doing back-up vocals. Performing with Grand Buffet In March 2007, Height accompanied Grand Buffet for their week of shows opening for Of Montreal. Only meant as a road trip, the trip resulted in Height becoming a part of the Grand Buffet's set, performing the Grand Buffet/Height collaborations, \\"Bad Weather\\" and \\"These Dreams are Fucked.\\" Throughout 2007 and 2008, Height would regularly perform as part of Grand Buffet's show, for their tours with Of Montreal, MGMT and Streetlght Manifesto. Height With Friends In December 2008, Height began performing with Mickey Free, Emily Slaughter and Travis Allen. They began billing themselves as Height With Friends. The name change was intended to help present the project as an official band, without distancing themselves from the earlier Height material. The name change was also meant to acknowledge a new, more collaborative production style. Although they continued to perform some older Height songs, their new songs were specifically created to be performed live, by multiple vocalists. The line-up would change frequently. In addition to the original cast, they would also be joined by Gavin Riley, Brendan Richmond, Liz Aeby, Cathy Cathodic, Bob O'Brien and Plucky Walker of Flesh Epic. Baltimore Highlands Baltimore Highlands, the first record under the name Height With Friends, was released on Wham City Records in January 2009. The album was created by a more collaborative approach, with multiple producers working together on most tracks. In an interview about the album with Butterteam.com, Jones described the album's production as being like a \\"chain letter,\\" with each producer adding an element and passing it on to someone else. In May 2009, the album was supported by the Wham City Records Is Real Tour, with Ed Schrader. They went on three other tours supporting the album that year, with Nuclear Power Pants, Thank You, Future Islands and Lord Grunge as tour mates. This album was followed by the release of the Baltimore Highlands Remix Album, which was released in October 2009. It contained remixes by Tobacco, San Serac, Lesser Gonzalez, Drew Swinburne, Cex, Ms. Paintbursh, PT Burnem, King Rhythm, Jones, AK, LOWD, DJ Authentic, Gavin Riley and Al Lover. Bed of Seeds Bed of Seeds was written, recorded and mixed between Fall 2009 and Spring 2010. Much of the recording took place during a ten-day session in a makeshift studio in a cabin in Deep Creek Lake, Maryland. The album's production was financed by Normative Records. The label folded as the album was being mixed, but the record was picked up by Friends Records and released in May 2010. This is the first Height With Friends project largely created with live instruments. The majority of the album's songs stray from the beats and rhymes format, employing chord structures and production styles from other forms of music. The rhyme schemes themselves sometimes resemble folk or pop verses, more than they do standard sixteen bar rap verses. The album was initially promoted with a two-month tour in April and May 2010. The April portion of the tour was with Nuclear Power Pants. Due to problems at the pressing plant, the vinyl was not available until the tail end of the tour. They continued promoting the album with two more short tours in 2010, then a 51-day tour in February 2011. For their last tour in support of Bed Of Seeds, Height With Friends joined PT Burnem for The Rap Ambassadors Tour. The tour went to Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, Poland, Croatia and France. Shark Tank Shark Tank is a side project that pairs Height with Lord Grunge, Mickey Free and Brendan Richmond. In February 2011, Shark Tank released their debut self-titled album. They did a small run of east coast shows to support the release. Videos Height With Friends has four videos, and Height has one video of this solo material. The video for their song \\"Mike Stone,\\" was directed by Justin Barnes and produced by Team G. It was nominated for an award for Best Music Video at the 2010 SXSW Film Festival.

Records indicate that a bridge may have been in place in this location as early as 1762. A previous bridge was destroyed in the flood of 1837 and a new bridge was constructed in 1841. This bridge would also be destroyed and the current bridge would be completed circa 1864. Utilizing the central pier from the previous incarnation, despite the Town lattice being able to withstand the weight and single span, the bridge has two spans. The later addition of queen trusses and supports gives the bridge an unusual appearance. Modernization of the bridge in 1968 and 1973 has continued to let the bridge handle traffic. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.  History  Located at the north-south and east-west roadway section of the riverside town of Cornwall, Connecticut, numerous bridges have been built at this location. As early as 1762, a bridge may have been in service here. The lifespan of these bridges was not a long term one, for floods and ice would demolish them frequently. Peter Vermilyea, author of Hidden History of Litchfield County, states that wooden bridges had typical life spans of seven to ten years. Town records list expenditures for repair and placement. For many decades the current West Cornwall bridge was believed to have been constructed in 1841, as a replacement for an earlier bridge that washed away in the flood of 1837. The 1841 date was even included on the National Register of Historic Places nomination and was claimed to have been supervised by Ithiel Town himself. At least one, but possibly several incarnations of these earlier bridges were known as the Hart Bridge, after a settler of West Cornwall. Local tradition states that Selectman Marcus Smith traveled to North Adams, Massachusetts to choose the timber for the bridge. The 1841 bridge may have been overseen by Ithiel Town, but the current bridge dates to about 1864 according to research by Michael R. Gannett for the Cornwall Historical Society. The center pier which supports of the middle bridge was likely reused from the previous bridge. In 1968, the State of Connecticut added the bridge to the state system and considered replacing it. A local committee in West Cornwall was created and organized to save the covered bridge, through their efforts the Connecticut Department of Transportation decided to renovate the bridge. The bridge was raised up an additional two feet and steel supports were inserted to support the roadway. In 1973, the roadway was reinforced with the addition of a concealed steel deck to support the weight of traffic. This project would win the Federal Highway Administration's award for outstanding historic preservation. Throughout its history, the bridge has endured against a series of disasters that threatened to demolish it. Flooding as a result of the 1938 New England hurricane and the flood of 1955, caused by the combined effects of both Hurricane Connie and Hurricane Diane, threatened to wash the bridge away. In 1961, a severe ice jam threatened to destroy the bridge, but the jam was successfully dynamited. The bridge also had to be repaired in 1945 after a 20-ton oil truck fell through the bridge floor.  Description  Constructed in 1864, the West Cornwall covered bridge is long, wide and supports one lane of vehicle traffic for the Sharon-Goshen Turnpike (Connecticut Route 128). The bridge's Town lattice truss is constructed of red-spruce timbers secured by treenails and the span is made of native oak. A secondary queen-post truss was added to the bridge at a later date, with one source stating that this was in 1887. The addition of the queen-post truss was likely to stiffen the bridge because wooden trusses have a tendency to sag. Prior to 1946, the bridge had a square port with a flat top, but this was modified to a gable roof which remains today. In 1957, the bridge was painted red for the first time. The bridge consists of two spans, 64.1 feet and 81.10 feet, with a 3.2 feet gap between them. The combined trussed portions of the bridge are 149.1 feet long. The bridge's Town lattice is an unusual design choice, but the later addition of the queen trusses are also unusual, resulting in a unique visual appearance by the bridge's unequal spans. This gives the appearance of kingposts within the queenposts. Since the addition of the steel I-beam flooring in 1973, the trusses have supported nothing but themselves. The State of Connecticut's lists the bridge as CT 1338 and the May 2012 inspection of the bridge found the deck and superstructure conditions to be satisfactory and condition of the substructure to be fair. The West Cornwall Covered bridge has been appraised as functionally obsolete. Significance  The bridge in winter. The West Cornwall covered bridge is very significant and important as one of only three surviving covered bridges in the state of Connecticut. The bridge's modification from the original Town lattice represents a unique design that is not repeated in either the Comstock's Bridge or Bull's Bridge. and The covered bridge is perhaps best known for being featured on postcards of New England villages. Terry Miller and Ronald Knapp assert that Charles Ives passed by the bridge on the way to the Berkshires which inspired the third movement in the Three Places in New England. The bridge appeared in the opening scenes of the movie, Valley of the Dolls a 1967 American drama film based on the 1966 novel of the same name by Jacqueline Susann. This brief scene occurs near the 2 minute mark of the film, during the opening credits. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Numerous photos, including photos from before the 20th-century renovations, are contained in Connecticut and Rhode Island Covered Bridges. Aerial view of the bridge.

He was the deputy president of the People's United Democratic Movement (Pudemo), Swaziland's main opposition party. Once working as a physician at Themba Hospital in Nelspruit, Mkhumane was in self-imposed exile, having left Swaziland in 1984 to live in Maputo, then in Cuba, where he received his medical training and lived for 15 years. According to the Swaziland Solidarity Network, he provided the impoverished with free medical services. To be nearer to his home country, Mkhumane settled in South Africa in 2000. He was married to Soraida and had two sons, Lizwi and Lizo (three weeks old at the time of his father's death). Despite his exile, he had been active in Pudemo-related activities such as marketing the Kingdom as an oppressive regime which hates democracy. Mkhumane was murdered on April 1, 2008, in Nelspruit, after attending a meeting to discuss blocking goods travelling to Swaziland. The annual blockade was to be held on April 12, the anniversary of when King Sobhuza II outlawed all political parties. It was since called off due to Mkhumane's death. He was gunned down in an ambush on his car and his killers quickly left after the crime. The official version of his murder is that he was killed in a random act of villainy, although some Pudemo supporters disagree, including its president, Mario Masuku. They claim Mkhumane was murdered by the Swazi government, pointing to the fact that Swazi police told his mother that he would come home \\"wrapped in a black bag\\" hours before his death was reported. His family members also claimed he began fearing for his life shortly before his death.

The term may also be written as ÈÉ≠, and the term is also used for castles built after the Edo period. The kuruwa serves as a defensive territory, provides space for additional castle facilities, and contains the living quarters for common soldiers, making it an important fixture of all Japanese castles. Most castles built during the middle ages contain many kuruwa of small area, while those built during or after the early modern period often contain a lesser number of kuruwa of larger area. The western equivalent is the motte-and-bailey. Arrangement The shape and structure of a castle were important factors in determining the victor of castle sieges, and the castle layout, or was arranged with the intention of giving the defender an insurmountable advantage. The kuruwa regions were planned for after the basic layout of the castle grounds was decided. The three basic kuruwa regions are the ; the core of the castle, and the and , which serve as auxiliary areas. There are three major styles of kuruwa arrangement: ; :The ninomaru and sannomaru surround the honmaru at the center. This arrangement increases the castle's defense in every direction, but surrounding each kuruwa requires a large area of land to be allotted to the castle grounds. Yamagata Castle is an example of a castle that uses this arrangement. ; :The honmaru and ninomaru are arranged side by side. This causes the depth of the castle to increase, but the sides and rear of the honmaru are exposed, making the castle more vulnerable to attacks on areas other than the central gate. Matsuyama Castle and Morioka Castle both use this kuruwa arrangement. ; :The honmaru is placed adjacent to the castle walls, and additional kuruwa are placed surrounding the honmaru. This arrangement is suited for castles built along natural barriers like swamps, rivers, mountains, or cliffs, since the natural barrier can cover the exposed side of the honmaru. Okayama Castle employs this arrangement. Many castles use a combination of the above three styles, and may fit into multiple categories of arrangement. Some castles may not be categorizable at all. Smaller kuruwa regions called and were sometimes placed around the central kuruwa in some arrangements. refers to a kuruwa that is placed independent from the central kuruwa, and refers to a kuruwa that is placed specifically to guard an important entrance. See below for more related terms. Image:rinkaku_en.pngRinkaku style Image:renkaku_en.pngRenkaku style Image:teikaku_en.pngTeikaku style Related terms Most of the terms take the form -kuruwa or -maru, but specific terms may differ depending on region or time period. Castles that use the naming -maru were built during the early modern period. Many castles contain kuruwa named after particular people or places. ;Honmaru :The honmaru is the core region of the castle, and serves as the living quarters for the castle ruler, and is the final line of defense of the castle. It may also be referred to by many other names including ichi no kuruwa, ichi-no-maru or honkuruwa. The kuruwa can house an expensive central structure from which the castle ruler oversees the on-goings within the castle, or those affairs can be conducted from the outer walls so that the honmaru can be used as a compact, core structure that serves as the final line of defense during a siege. ;Tenshumaru :The tenshumaru is a smaller kuruwa often located within the honmaru which houses the tenshu; the central fixture of all post-Sengoku period Japanese castles. Very few tenshu remain intact, and K≈çchi Castle is the only castle that still contains its original tenshu. Tenshu entrances remain at Kawagoe Castle and Matsumae Castle. ;Ninomaru & sannomaru :Also known as ninokuruwa or sannokuruwa, these regions serve as outside layers to the honmaru, and may vary in shape and size. Expansive ones can also house large living spaces similar to the structures within the honmaru itself. ;Nishinomaru :Nishinomaru (lit. \\"western circle\\") is used as the castle ruler's retreat. The term was coined after Tokugawa Ieyasu, who lived in the eastern section of Edo Castle after retiring from his post as ruler. Nishinomaru are also present in Himeji Castle and Okayama Castle. ;Obikuruwa & koshikuruwa :These terms refer to a narrow space created by walls to surround another kuruwa. They allowed defenders to better prevent the breach of an important castle sector, and were double-layered in the largest castles. ;S≈çkuruwa :This term refers to a kuruwa created by surrounding the castle town with a large moat, earthwork fortification, or stone wall. It is the largest and outermost kuruwa of any castle. ;Demaru :The demaru is a separate kuruwa placed to strengthen a vulnerable spot or structure within the castle. The buke shohatto limited (essentially prohibited) the construction of castle walls, leading to the development of large \\"daimyo gardens\\" in place of the demaru. ;Umadashi Remnant of an umadashi kuruwa outside of Sasayama Castle's east gate. :The umadashi is a small kuruwa placed in front of the castle's entrance. In addition to simply making it difficult for the enemy to enter the castle grounds, it provides space for the defenders to repel the enemy with projectiles. It can also serve as a barracks for small parties of soldiers. This kuruwa can consist of any sort of wall from a shoddy earthwork fortification to large, strong walls as seen in Nagoya Castle, Sasayama Castle, and Hiroshima Castle. ;Mizunote kuruwa :This refers to any kuruwa containing the castle's water supply.

His disciples included Shri Anandi Ma and Omdasji Maharaj. He was a master of Kundalini Maha Yoga who was responsible for popularizing it in the United States.. Biography=Childhood Kashinath was born in winter of 1878* (Footnote 1) in Durgadi, a village in Bihar, India, to Sampatti Devi Mishra and Ramdahin Mishra. His parents named him Kashinath after Lord Shiva. Prior to his birth, his mother reported having a vision of Lord Krishna. Devotees in India regard such visions as auspicious signs indicating the coming of a great being. Kashinath grew up in a devout Hindu family. While other children were playing, he was reportedly meditating. By age seven, Kashinath was consumed by questions about identity and mortality. At one point, he reportedly ran away in search of the meaning of death, but was retrieved by his parents and sent to a school. At age 13, Kashinath left home for good to reportedly search for spiritual enlightenment. Spiritual quest and meeting his Satguru For the next 30 years, Kashinath travelled across India. He ofter visited remote and unsettled areas, seeking saints and yogis living in seclusion to teach him. He would eventually become adept at Mantra, Yantra, Hatha, Raja and Jnana yogic practices and philosophies. At age 27, Kashinath took his vows of renunciation (sannyasa) and received the spiritual name of Madhusudandas. Although he had mastered many yogic paths and practised intense austerities, Kashinath believed that he had failed to attain his ultimate goal of self-realization. In 1921, while practising stringent austerities in a cave on Mount Abu in Rajasthan, Kashinath met his Satguru. Shri Yogiraj Parameshwardas, a master of Kundalini yoga. Shri Parameshwardas bestowed Shaktipat initiation on Kashinath. According to Kashinath, he immediately he attained the highest state of samadhi and his ultimate goal of self-realization. Kashinath recounts that when he opened his eyes three days later, Shri Parameshwardas was sitting before him in the form of Lord Hanuman. Lord Hanuman, was the quintessential devotee of Shri Rama embodying the highest level of bhakti (devotional love), jnana (knowledge of Reality), vairagya (renunciation or detachment) and seva (selfless service). According to And these Divine qualities of Lord Hanuman became the hallmarks of Shri Dhyanyogi Madhusudandas. Life Mission Through the guidance of Shri Parameshwardas, Kashinath became a master of Kundalini Maha Yoga. This would give him the power to awaken the dormant Kundalini in spiritual aspirants, and to then guide their spiritual evolution from subtle levels. In recognition of this attainment, Shri Parameshwardas conferred on Kashinath the honorary title \\"Dhyanyogi.\\" *(footnote 2) After this, Kashinath carried on his work and teachings in a small ashram which he established in Bandhavad in the Indian state of Gujarat. In 1960, Kashinath began widespread public instruction in Kundalini Maha Yoga, conducting group meditations throughout India. For millennia, Shaktipat had been an esoteric path to self-realization, not openly bestowed, or explicitly discussed in ancient Vedic scriptures like the Bhagavad Gita. Kashinath became one of the first teachers of this ancient tradition to openly work at a mass level by bestowing Shaktipat initiation on all who sought it from him. He said: ‚ÄúAll those who came to me for Shaktipat are worthy, and all of them are my spiritual heirs. For my energy works through them.‚Äù In late 1960s and early 1970s, During a protracted drought and famine in Gujarat, Kashinath collected charitable funds for relief there. On 7 December 1971, exhausted by his unceasing efforts for famine victims, Kashinath suffered a dramatic near-death experience (NDE) which he recounted in a pamphlet entitled \\"Death, Dying and Beyond\\". He reported being taken to a heavenly abode of Lord Rama, his principal devotional deity. But then being sent back by Rama to his \\"dead\\" body to fulfill his desire to help many people, whose faces were shown to him from that subtle dimension beyond our Earthly \\"reality\\". After the NDE, Kashinath established a secondary school in Bandhwad, a hospital in a backward area of Bihar to help the needy, and a temple on his small Bandhwad ashram. Introduction of Kundalini Maha Yoga to America In 1976, Kashinath left India for the first time to expand his worldwide mission, described as helping spiritual seekers and raising humanity's consciousness. Following prior requests from American devotees, Kashinath came to the United States. He traveled around the country teaching meditation and offering Shaktipat. . During Kashinath's four years in the US, he established many local groups and initiated thousands into Kundalini Maha Yoga. In his US lectures, he revealed that during his 1971 NDE he had seen and identified many of the same people who came to him in the West. He said: ‚ÄúMany of those faces that I saw in the courtyard of Lord Rama, I have seen here, since I came to America. All of the people I saw are my family, and I have to help them.‚Äù In introducing Kundalini Maha Yoga to Americans, Kashinath said that it was not a religion but a spiritual practice bringing ‚Äúlasting inner peace and happiness to individuals of any belief or religious affiliation.‚Äù He describes this path in the book ‚ÄúShakti: An Introduction to Kundalini Maha Yoga.‚Äù Final years and death In 1980, at age 102, Kashinath returned to India where he spent his remaining years in or near Ahmedabad, in Gujarat. On 29 August 1994, the anniversary of Lord Krishna's birth, Kashinath died. To his devotees, it meant that he left his physical. Many of his devotees report that they continue to experience his transformative shakti energy at subtle levels of awareness.  Yogic powers  According to his devotees, Kashinath displayed extraordinary physical prowess, emanated exceptional spiritual energy, and sometimes demonstrated what Westerners call ‚Äúmiracles‚Äù. People witnessed him as a centenarian demonstrating difficult yogic postures ‚Äì like head stands ‚Äì and walking so fast that young people had to jog to keep up with his extraordinary pace. Even after he became physically debilitated, Kashinath reportedly emanated an intense shakti energy field. People (and even objects) touched by or near him were long imbued with this transformative energy. In \\"Death, Dying and Beyond\\" Kashinath told how three or four different people who attempted to help him during his NDE experience immediately fell unconscious into deep meditative states when they touched his body. Only after he returned to his body to help them were they able to awaken from these states. Kashinath occasionally demonstrated \\"miracles\\" to foster faith in the Divine. Many of those \\"miracles\\" were anecdotally reported by his devotees.See e.g. his biography \\"This House Is on Fire: The Life of Shri Dhyanyogi‚Äù by Shri Anandi Ma. and spiritual Memoirs of Ron Rattner In his writings and lectures, Kashinath explained that yogic powers (siddhis) might be attained via control of life- force energies, but that they were seldom displayed; that such powers are used \\"sparingly and on occasion for humanitarian and other discretionary ends,\\" but not \\"for self-aggrandizement.\\" ~ Light on Meditation, Shri Dhyanyogi Madhusudandas, page 71: Kashinath was especially interested in scientifically demonstrating yogic powers of mantra and of mind. Accordingly, he presided over scientific demonstrations of how pulse and blood pressure readings of meditators could be influenced by his chanting of powerful Bija (seed) Mantras. Kashinath reportedly demonstrated that he could at will increase or decrease his own blood pressure by his yogic powers.

He was first appointed on January 1, 1891. He resigned February 28, 1925. He served three terms as Chief Justice, from 1897 to 1905, from 1915 to 1917, and from 1923 to 1925. Early life Justice Taylor was born in Myrtle Hill, South Carolina. His father, John Morgandollar Taylor, was a cotton and rice planter in Beaufort District, South Carolina. His mother was Maria (Baker) Taylor. The family moved to Marion County, Florida before Taylor was three. Taylor was tutored at home. Taylor fought as a volunteer in the Battle of Gainesville. After the end of the War, he went to school at Baltimore's Maryland Military Institute. He left MMI and was tutored in \\"ancient languages\\" before reading law.\\"Biography of Robert R. Taylor.\\" in Memoirs of Florida. Volume 2. 1902. pp 696-697.Florida Center for Library Automation. Online. July 24, 2008. Career Taylor then read law with his brother-in- law, Gainesville, Florida attorney James B. Dawkins, an attendee of the Florida secession convention and a member of the Congress of the Confederate States. In 1870 he was admitted to the Ocala Bar. He and Dawkins shared a law practice in Gainesville for seven years. After Dawkins became a judge, Taylor partnered with Edward C. F. Sanchez. He worked behind the scenes in Democratic, anti-Reconstruction politics until Alachua County Democrats sent him and Dawkins to the constitutional convention of 1885, where he chaired a committee. Taylor was appointed to the Florida Supreme Court in January 1891 by Governor Francis P. Fleming to replace outgoing Justice Henry Laurens Mitchell. He was re-elected to the Court six times. He served three terms as Chief Justice. As a conservative defender of personal and property rights, he wrote more than 500 opinions and was involved in more than 7,000 cases. Taylor wrote the opinion for the Florida Supreme Court in Sligh vs Kirkwood (Sheriff). In this case, the Court unanimously upheld a law prohibiting exportation of \\"fruit unfit for consumption.\\" Sligh had sued to overturn his conviction for delivering immature fruit to Georgia, saying the Florida law trespassed on Congresses sole authority to regulate interstate trade. Ironically, he also said the law was in conflict with the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. Although the law did incidentally prohibit the interstate sale of \\"green\\" fruit, it was when the state's police powers to protect public health. The Act banned \\"commerce in filthy, decomposed or putrid vegetable products\\", but made no mention of immature fruit. The Court held that this left the matter of immature fruit up to the states, and that the state law conflicted with no federal law. The \\"Wells Quart Law\\" had been passed as part of the Florida Legislature's efforts to curb the sale of liquor. It forbade the transport of alcoholic beverages into counties where their sale was prohibited. The Court held that this restricted personal property rights. The law was unconstitutional, in that although it could regulate the sale and transport of alcoholic beverages, the Legislature did not have the authority to restrict private ownership or use of alcoholic beverages. The \\"Davis Package Law\\", enacted in 1915, prohibited the sell of alcoholic beverages in packages smaller than 1 pint, open containers, and consumption at the point of sale. In Ex parte Pricha,, liquor dealers contended the law violated Florida's Constitution, \\"by depriving citizens of . . . inalienable rights, including acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, without due process.\\" The court split, writing four different decisions. Justice Shackleford rejected the notion that the law was unconstitutional. Justice Ellis contended strongly that the Legislature had exceeded its power. Justice Taylor concurred with Ellis, that the law was an unconstitutional usurpation on the people's authority to prohibit liquor sales (or not) by popular vote in each county, and that the law violated the sanctity of private property. Personal Taylor resigned form the Court on February 28, 1925. He had married Amelia E. Haile in 1872. They had three children, Carl Hugo, Serena Haile, and an unnamed baby girl who died soon after birth. He was a Mason and a member of the Presbyterian Church. He died of pneumonia and kidney failure on February 26, 1928 at his home in Tallahassee. ReferencesSources Justices of the Florida Supreme Court. July 23, 2008. * Manley, Walter W., Brown, E.

Overview The poem is spoken by the landlord of the Wayside Inn and tells a partly fictionalized story of Paul Revere. In the poem, Revere tells a friend to prepare signal lanterns in the Old North Church (North End, Boston) to inform him whether the British will attack by land or sea. He would await the signal across the river in Charlestown and be ready to spread the alarm throughout Middlesex County, Massachusetts. The unnamed friend climbs up the steeple and soon sets up two signal lanterns, informing Revere that the British are coming by sea. Revere rides his horse through Medford, Lexington, and Concord to warn the patriots. Composition and publication history Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in 1860, the year he wrote \\"Paul Revere's Ride\\", painted by Thomas Buchanan Read Longfellow was inspired to write the poem after visiting the Old North Church and climbing its tower on April 5, 1860. He began writing the poem the next day.Triber, Jayne E. A True Republican: The Life of Paul Revere. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1998: 1. It was first published in the January 1861 issue of The Atlantic Monthly. It was later re-published in Longfellow's Tales of a Wayside Inn as \\"The Landlord's Tale\\" in 1863. The poem served as the first in a series of 22 narratives bundled as a collection, similar to Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, and was published in three installments over 10 years.Calhoun, Charles C. Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004: 230. . Longfellow's family had a connection to the historical Paul Revere. His maternal grandfather, Peleg Wadsworth, was Revere's commander on the Penobscot Expedition.Fischer, David Hackett. Paul Revere's Ride. New York: Oxford University Press, 1994: 289. Analysis When the poem was written in 1860, America was on the verge of Civil War. Longfellow first came forward publicly as an abolitionist in 1842 with the publication of his Poems on Slavery. Though he admitted the book made little impact,Irmscher, Christoph. Longfellow Redux. University of Illinois, 2006: 60. it was written for his best friend, Charles Sumner, an activist abolitionist politician with whom he would continue to share common cause on the issues of slavery and the Union. \\"Paul Revere's Ride\\" was published in the January 1861, issue of The Atlantic magazine on December 20, 1860, just as South Carolina became the first state to secede from the United States.Lepore, Jill, \\"Paul Revere‚Äôs Ride Against Slavery\\", Op-ed, The New York Times, December 18, 2010 (December 19, 2010 p. WK8 NY ed.). Retrieved 2010-12-19. The poem was meant to appeal to Northerners' sense of urgency and, as a call for action, noted that history favors the courageous.Bundy, Carol. The Nature of Sacrifice: A Biography of Charles Russell Lowell, Jr., 1835‚Äì64. Macmillan, 2005: 185‚Äì186. Longfellow, who often used poetry to remind readers of cultural and moral values,Howe, Daniel Walker. What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815‚Äì1848. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007: 630. warns at the end of the poem of a coming \\"hour of darkness and peril and need\\", implying the breakup of the Union, and suggests that the \\"people will waken and listen to hear\\" the midnight message again. By emphasizing common history, he was attempting to dissolve social tensions.Sorby, Angela. Schoolroom Poets: Childhood, Performance, and the Place of American Poetry, 1865‚Äì1917. Lebanon, NH: University of New Hampshire Press, 2005: 25. The phrase \\"Hardly a man is now alive\\" was true as one of the last men alive at the time had only recently died. Jonathan Harrington, the young fifer for Lexington's militia during the battles of Lexington and Concord, died at the age of 96 in 1854, a few years before the poem was written. The poem fluctuates between past and present tense, sometimes in the same sentence, symbolically pulling the actions of the Revolution into modern times and displaying an event with timeless sympathies.Sorby, Angela. Schoolroom Poets: Childhood, Performance, and the Place of American Poetry, 1865‚Äì1917. Lebanon, NH: University of New Hampshire Press, 2005: 19‚Äì20. Longfellow's poem is not historically accurate but his \\"mistakes\\" were deliberate. He had researched the historical event, using works like George Bancroft's History of the United States, but he manipulated the facts for poetic effect.Fischer, David Hackett. Paul Revere's Ride. New York: Oxford University Press, 1994: 331. He was purposefully trying to create American legends, much as he did with works like The Song of Hiawatha (1855) and The Courtship of Miles Standish (1858).Ruland, Richard and Malcolm Bradbury. From Puritanism to Postmodernism: A History of American Literature. New York: Viking, 1991: 109. Critical response=Modern 1940s illustration of Paul Revere's ride Modern critics of the poem emphasize its many historical inaccuracies. For example, the poem depicts the lantern signal in the Old North Church as meant for Revere, but actually the signal was from Revere: the historical Paul Revere did not receive the lantern signal, but actually was the one who ordered it to be set up. The poem also depicts Revere rowing himself across the Charles River when, in reality, he was rowed over by others. He also did not reach Concord that night.Gale, Robert L. A Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Companion. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2003: 244. Another inaccuracy is a general lengthening of the time frame of the night's events. The majority of criticism, however, notes that Longfellow gave sole credit to Revere for the collective achievements of three riders (as well as other riders, whose names do not survive to history). In fact, Revere and William Dawes rode (via different routes) from Boston to Lexington to warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams that British soldiers were marching from Boston to Lexington to arrest Hancock and Adams and seize the weapons stores in Concord. Revere and Dawes rode toward Concord, where the militia's arsenal was hidden; they were joined by Samuel Prescott, a doctor who lived in Concord and happened to be in Lexington. Revere, Dawes, and Prescott were stopped by British troops in Lincoln on the road to Concord. Prescott and Dawes escaped, but Revere was detained and questioned and then escorted at gunpoint by three British officers back to Lexington. Of the three riders, only Prescott arrived at Concord in time to warn the militia there.  Historical impact  Paul Revere (1940) by Cyrus Edwin Dallin, North End, Boston, Massachusetts. The Old North Church is visible in the background. Longfellow's poem is credited with creating the national legend of Paul Revere, a previously little-known Massachusetts silversmith. Upon Revere's death in 1818, for example, his obituary did not mention his midnight ride but instead focused on his business sense and his many friends.Roark, Elisabeth L. Artists of Colonial America. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2003: 127. The fame that Longfellow brought to Revere, however, did not materialize until after the Civil War amidst the Colonial Revival Movement of the 1870s.Calhoun, Charles C. Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004: 231. . In 1875, for example, the Old North Church mentioned in the poem began an annual custom called the \\"lantern ceremony\\" recreating the action of the poem.Fischer, David Hackett. Paul Revere's Ride. New York: Oxford University Press, 1994: 334. Three years later, the Church added a plaque noting it as the site of \\"the signal lanterns of Paul Revere\\".Sorby, Angela. Schoolroom Poets: Childhood, Performance, and the Place of American Poetry, 1865‚Äì1917. Lebanon, NH: University of New Hampshire Press, 2005: 15. Revere's elevated historical importance also led to unsubstantiated rumors that he made a set of false teeth for George Washington. Revere's legendary status continued for decades and, in part due to Longfellow's poem, authentic silverware made by Revere commanded high prices. Wall Street tycoon J. P. Morgan, for example, offered $100,000 for a punch bowl Revere made.Axelrod, Alan. The Real History of the American Revolution: A New Look at the Past. New York: Sterling Publishing, 2007: 82. In 1883, Boston held a national competition for an equestrian statue of Revere. It was won by Cyrus Edwin Dallin, although his model was not accepted until 1899, and the statue was not dedicated until 1940. It stands in \\"Paul Revere Plaza,\\" opposite the Old North Church. In 1896 Helen F. Moore, dismayed that William Dawes had been forgotten, penned a parody of Longfellow's poem: : 'Tis all very well for the children to hear : Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere; : But why should my name be quite forgot, : Who rode as boldly and well, God wot? : Why should I ask? The reason is clear‚Äî : My name was Dawes and his Revere. For a long time, historians of the American Revolution as well as textbook writers relied almost entirely on Longfellow's poem as historical evidence ‚Äì creating substantial misconceptions in the minds of the American people. In re-examining the episode, some historians in the 20th century have attempted to demythologize Paul Revere almost to the point of marginalization. While it is true that Revere was not the only rider that night, that does not refute the fact that Revere successfully completed the first phase of his mission to warn Adams and Hancock. Other historians have since stressed Revere's importance, including David Hackett Fischer in his book Paul Revere's Ride (1995), a scholarly study of Revere's role in the opening of the Revolution. In 2007, the United States Postal Service (USPS) issued a commemorative stamp with images referencing the poem. Longfellow is represented by a painting by artist Kazuhiko Sano.

The island is primarily wooded and residential and has an area of . History The island was originally granted to British colonial governor John Wentworth in 1772, although the island had already been known as Governor's Island, possibly after his uncle, Benning Wentworth, the previous governor of the colony.Mulligan, Adair D.(1995), The Gunstock Parish: a history of Gilford, New Hampshire. West Kennebunk: Phoenix Publishing, In 1778 during the American Revolution, the New Hampshire legislature confiscated the lands of hitherto Governor Wentworth (who had fled to Nova Scotia) and ordered that the lands, including Governor's Island, be auctioned off, which they were in 1780 to John Cushing of Boston for 9,600 Continental pounds. Cushing in turn sold the island to John Langdon of Portsmouth in 1788. Langdon went on to become a United States senator for New Hampshire and governor of New Hampshire in his own right. Langdon sold the island in 1797 to Lemuel Mason, a former Revolutionary War soldier from Alton, New Hampshire. The island was bought by Eleazer Davis in 1799, and the island remained in the Davis family until 1857 under the stewardship of his son Nathaniel Davis. Nathaniel adhered to the Millerite faith and held revival camps on the island with William Miller himself officiating. Nathaniel's sons Franklin and Eleazer sold the island in 1857 to George Smith of Meredith and David Plummer of Concord, New Hampshire. In 1872, the island was sold to Isaac Merrill and Henry Brown of Gilford, who in turn sold it to its most famous modern owner in 1880. The buyer was Stilson Hutchins of Washington, DC, founding owner and editor of The Washington Post. Hutchins had a grand mansion built out of granite there in 1885, which he used as his summer home. The architect was Alfred B. Mullett, the supervising architect of the U.S. Treasury, and the construction manager was Job W. Angus, who had built the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. Hutchins had U.S. presidents as summer guests, including Grover Cleveland and Theodore Roosevelt. From 1903 to 1908, Hutchins leased the island to the German ambassador to the United States, Count von Sternburg, and during summers the island served as the location of the German Embassy to the United States with a staff of twenty. The Hutchins family sold the island in 1928 to real estate developer Clifford Hayes, who went bankrupt in 1935 during the Great Depression, resulting in the few residents forming an association, the current Governor's Island Club, to take over the island.
