The entire loop stretches about . Traveling the Great Loop There is no single route or itinerary to complete the loop. To avoid winter ice and summer hurricanes, boaters generally traverse the Great Lakes and Canadian waterways in summer, travel down the Mississippi or the Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway in fall, cross the Gulf of Mexico and Florida in the winter, and travel up the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway in the spring. Depending on speed of travel, the route may take as little as two months, although more often people take a year to complete the trip. The route may also be completed in segments. The first recorded instance of someone completing the Great Loop was three boys who did it in a sailboat in the 1890s. Looper culture Those boaters who are on the loop often fly a white burgee and those who have completed the loop fly a gold one. The America's Great Loop Cruisers' Association (AGLCA) assists Great Loop cruisers by sharing safety and navigational and cruising information, while providing a networking platform for Loopers through its members-only discussion forum. Boaters can exchange information about topics such as marinas, locking through, water depth, hazards, repairs, fuel prices or dinner reservations and sight seeing. The AGLCA also hosts twice-yearly gatherings for Loopers currently on the Loop and those planning a Great Loop trip.

He is the author, besides, of two other novels, Carmichael's Dog (1992) and Glass Mountain (2001), and (with Panamanian man of letters Guillermo Sánchez Borbón), of In the Time of the Tyrants (1990), a history of the Torrijos-Noriega dictatorship in Panama. Background Koster was born in Brooklyn, New York, attended Poly Prep, and has degrees from both Yale and New York University. He taught English at the National University of Panama, and from 1964 to 2001 was a member of the faculty of the Florida State University, serving at its Panama branch. He has lectured in English and Spanish at universities in the United States and Latin America. In 2003 he was a visiting professor at Southern Methodist University. Koster has had parallel careers in politics and journalism. He was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1967 to 1996, served on many Democratic panels, and wrote presidential debate copy for Senator John Kerry in 2004. Debate copy for Kerry During the 1960s and '70s he reported from Panama for the Copely News Service and Newsweek magazine. He has reported more recently for the New York Times and has contributed prolifically to the Spanish language press in Panama. He was interviewed on National Public Radio about his book, In the Time of the Tyrants Radio interview Koster went to Panama as a soldier in the late 1950s and has lived there since. His wife, Otilia Tejeira, was a soloist with Panama’s National Ballet and has had a subsequent career as a human rights monitor. They have two children and three grandchildren. McDowell Bible College named their English and humanities program the Richard Koster School of Humanities. http://www.mcdowellbiblecollege.org Tinieblas trilogy Each novel focuses on a larger-than-life protagonist around whom the action revolves. The author himself likens the books to the panels of a triptych, \\"since each of the three is complete in itself and since they need not be considered in the order of their publication.\\" Major characters from one book appear as minor characters in the others, and vice versa. The unifying \\"character\\" of all three is Tinieblas itself. \\"The Prince\\" is introduced by a list of the Presidents of the Republic of Tinieblas, some of whom were illegitimate (\\"appointed with the advice and consent of the U.S. Ambassador\\") and some of whom left office spectacularly (\\"deposed and fed to sharks,\\" \\"held office for 36 hours and resigned when his ammunition ran out.\\") The narration is taken up by Enrique \\"Kiki\\" Sancudo, son of the man who has most often been President. Now a quadriplegic, blasted into a wheelchair by the gun of his only friend, he reviews the histories of his country and his father along with his own as a complete man of action—wrestler, arms smuggler, Olympic champion, Lothario, gambler at Yale, Ambassador to Paris, husband of a movie star, and eventually presidential candidate. All the while he campaigns for his father's fourth re-election and plans a fiendish revenge. Amid the typical tragedies of a Central American Republic—poverty, coups and countercoups, disastrous financial intrigues—are interspersed bouts of high comedy and magical realism: the national sport of Tineieblas is running for president; Kiki at one point in his smuggling career becomes so calloused that he is literally bulletproof; his father runs one election campaign entirely by astrology; conflict over an American military base near the capital of Tinieblas causes a \\"flag plague\\" in which activists break out in stinging rashes of their national colors. The Dissertation presents itself as a doctoral thesis with contrapuntal stories in the text and notes. A biography of the only honest President of Tineiblas, Leon Fuertes (assassinated 1964), written by his son, Camilo, the notes (in the manner of Nabokov's \\"Pale Fire\\") advance Camilo's story of academic and political intrigue and marital difficulty, while the body of the narrative relates the ancestry and history of his father. Cammilo's research methods are unique: he interviews spirits of the dead for information before resorting to libraries and published sources. \\"Mandragon\\" relates the tale of the title character, a Tinieblan native, hermaphrodite, and circus freak who develops genuine powers of psychic healing, telepathy, and prophecy. After a Charles Manson-like existence in New York (complete with female hippie entourage but minus the crime of murder), he returns to his native country and is enmeshed in a deadly intrigue involving the President of the country, an affair with his wife, and the machinations of a Howard-Hughes like billionaire on the run. Each protagonist is a political leader, in The Prince an adventurer on the model of Cesare Borgia, in Mandragon a charismatic like Savonarola. For the subject of The Dissertation political ambition is a disease, yet he accepts leadership when it is thrust upon him. Koster's storytelling seems heavily influenced by Vladimir Nabokov and the magical realists such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The prose abounds with flights of fancy, spectacular allusions to literature, chess terms, world history and theology, along with multiple puns in Spanish and English. The existence of the supernatural is taken for granted: President Sancudo's astrology-directed campaign is immensely successful; Camilo Fuertes's interviews with ghosts yield provable facts; Mandragon successfully extracts cancer tumors from patients. The tone is relentlessly black-comic but many of the base events portrayed—elections, smuggling, war—seem perfectly plausible. The three books received considerable acclaim, including a National Book Award nomination for The Prince. Other works Carmichael's Dog (1992), takes place in a parallel universe wherein the United States is a kingdom, the Army's service pistol is an \\"Ingersol,\\" and characters quote the poet-playwright Robin Speckshaft, whose works include Launcelot and Guinevere, Ornella Whore of Tunis, and Malaspina Duke of Ancona (the latter’s protagonist has his dwarf strangled for making him smile). Carmichael, a best-selling science fiction writer, is unknowingly possessed by demons representing all Seven Deadly Sins (the novel is narrated by the first demon to possess him, who causes him to be slothful). The ultimate battle for possession of his soul ensues when he acquires an unlikely champion: a faithful Pomeranian dog, who instinctively knows something is up, and what to do about it. Critical Appreciation John le Carré thanked Koster in the acknowledgements to his The Tailor of Panama for his great help in providing local history and details. Larry J. McDowell, author of Alabama Slim: It All Started in Korea, acknowledged, \\"to Richard Dick Koster of Panama, who wrote and inspired others, who taught me to love literature and who discouraged me from accepting mediocrity in myself— to work to overcome weaknesses, as other professors just told me that I had no talent.\\" Partial bibliography *The Prince (1972) *The Dissertation (1975) *Mandragon (1979) *In the Time of Tyrants: Panama : 1968-1990, by R.

It has been introduced to several other shores, and is now an invasive species in North America and Europe. Description H. sanguineus has a squarish carapace, in width, with three teeth along the forward sides; its pereiopods are marked with alternating light and dark bands. The males have a bulb-like structure at the base of the movable finger on their claws. Other distinguishing features include three spines on each side of the carapace. Adult crabs sizes range from 35–42 mm width. These crabs are opportunistic omnivores that tend to favor other animals over algae. As crab density of the invaded area increases, so does the diet breadth, which suggests that competition alters selection of food. There currently is no mitigation against these crabs. A natural enemy of H. sanguineus is Sacculina polygenea, a parasite that attacks adult shore crabs and is specific to H. sanguineus. Ecology and life cycle H. sanguineus is an \\"opportunistic omnivore\\" that prefers to eat other animals, especially molluscs, when possible. It tolerates a wide range of salinities (euryhaline) and temperatures (eurythermic). Females produce up to 50,000 eggs at a time, and can produce 3–4 broods per year. The eggs hatch into zoea larvae, which develop through four further zoea stages, and one megalopa stage, over the course of 16–25 days. The eggs hatch typically late summer or fall, into larvae and the juvenile crabs molt in five stages to become megalopae, which typically takes about a month. Once in this stage, the crabs settle and metamorphosize into full grown crabs. The larvae are planktonic, can be transported long distances during their development into the benthic adults.  Habitat  Typically, the crabs live in areas with large rocks, such as in between boulders of rocky shores. Hemigrapsus sanguineus inhabits many artificial structures such as on oyster reefs. H. sanguineus can tolerate other habitats, such as salt marshes.  Ecological impacts  The invasion of the habitat by the H. sanguineus has been characterized by rapid geographical expansion and widespread displacement of competing crab species. Although this species has been introduced to such a large habitat, H. sanguineus is eaten by native crustacean eating fishes. Since the crabs are so abundant, some types of native fish even prefer the invading crab. This may be due to the mouths of fish adapting to the size of H. sanguineus because they are the most abundant food source. On the other hand, native crabs also have adapted to eat H. sanguineus, possibly due to the availability of the food source or as an anti- predator strategy. There is a possibility that H. sanguineus could expand and possibly overwhelm the habitat and out compete native crustaceans, such as the blue crab and lobster.  Diet  Because the crabs are opportunistic omnivores, these crabs will eat anything they can get their mouths around. H. sanguineus prefers to consume animals, but during a period of starvation, these crabs tend to not have a food preference. Most of the animals consumed by H. sanguineus are small invertebrates, such as mussels, snails, and amphipods. The diet of these crabs is overall very broad. Distribution The native distribution of H. sanguineus is in coastal waters of the northwestern Pacific Ocean, ranging from Peter the Great Bay in southern Russia, to Hong Kong. Introduced distribution The first record outside its native range was from Townsends Inlet, Cape May County, New Jersey (between Avalon and Sea Isle City) in 1988. The larvae are thought to be transported by ballast water of yachts and cargo ships coming from their native breadth. From the 1990s, it spread as an invasive species and became increasingly common, now ranging from eastern Maine (Great Wass Island) to North Carolina. In 1999, H. sanguineus was reported for the first time from European waters, having been discovered at Le Havre (France) and the Oosterschelde estuary (the Netherlands). It has since been found along a long stretch of the continental coast of the English Channel, from the Cotentin Peninsula to the Dover Strait. Its range has extended east and north along the North Sea coastline, including northwestern Germany and Western Jutland of Denmark. In the United Kingdom, it has been recorded from Guernsey and Jersey, and in Kent and south Wales. The species was first reported to be found in Sweden in 2012.Invasive crab found once more in Swedish waters, Radio Sweden, 2015-08-07 In 2019, Swedish authorities reported that a private person collected more than 50 specimens of the crab in the vicinity of the island of Orust in the Skagerrak–Kattegat region.

The writer of the band's biggest hits, he was known for his intense guitar style. Background and early career The son of an Epping Forest GP, Dr Richard James Cairns MBE, David Cairns was first inspired to take up the guitar after an encounter at a local nightclub with BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who recommended the teenager listen to a Lynyrd Skynyrd album. He was also inspired by a live performance by The Who at Charlton Athletic's football ground in 1976 and while at sixth form teamed up with singer Ian Page, forming power pop/punk band New Hearts. The band signed to CBS Records in 1977, releasing two singles and touring with The Jam, before being released from their recording contract in mid-1978, although their unreleased album New Hearts, A Secret Affair, The CBS Sessions was finally released on Cherry Red Records, October 2009. Secret Affair After the demise of the New Hearts, Cairns continued to work with Page, forming Secret Affair. The two songwriters spent the second half of 1978 writing songs that would form the basis of the first two Secret Affair albums. In a period of a little over two years, the band posted five releases in the UK Singles Chart, and released three albums. The debut single \\"Time For Action\\" sold 198,000 copiesTime For Action: The Anthology (Sanctuary) sleeve note by Chris Hunt and reached number 13 in the UK chart in 1979, putting them at the forefront of the mod revival movement. More chart success followed with \\"Let Your Heart Dance\\", \\"My World\\" and \\"Sound Of Confusion\\". Although Cairns and Page would often write together, three of the band's biggest chart hits (\\"Time For Action\\", \\"My World\\" and \\"Sound Of Confusion\\") were written by Cairns alone. Later career After the split of Secret Affair in 1982, Cairns formed The Flag with singer Archie Brown, signing to Scotti Brothers Records/CBS in the U.S. Relocating to Los Angeles for a year, the band toured supporting A Flock of Seagulls and released the USA only album, Flag which featured Dave Ruffy on drums (The Ruts), Nathan East on bass (Eric Clapton Band)and John Van Tongeren on keyboards. Cairns subsequently teamed up with Scottish singer Alan King in Walk on Fire,Eyeplug: Interview with Dave Cairns writing the majority of the band's material and playing keyboards on their live tours. Signing to MCA in the US, and managed by Bill Curbishley of The Who and Plant/Page fame, they released the album Blind Faith in 1990 and toured supporting Foreigner, Nils Lofgren, and the Dan Reed Network. In 1992 he moved away from playing and joined Gibson Guitars as Special Projects & Events manager, promoting major Gibson shows around the world; in particular UK charity events promoted by Harvey Goldsmith in aid of The Prince's Trust, and developing new custom guitar models for artists such as Jimmy Page and Noel Gallagher before leaving the company in 2000 having managed Gibson's London, Orlando and Memphis offices to join Peugeot as an events manager (in particular the 207 car launch) and later Toyota and Ford. Secret Affair reunion In 2002 he once again teamed up with Page to reform Secret Affair, initially for three concerts in the UK, including a performance at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire. They returned in June the following year, playing at The Scala in London to promote the release of Time For Action: The Anthology (Sanctuary), a major CD retrospective of hits, rarities and previously unreleased tracks. The concert was filmed and released on DVD. In 2005 Page and Cairns attempted to mend their sometimes fractious relationship and started work on a fourth Secret Affair album, recording five new songs. The album remains unfinished and unreleased . In the meantime Cairns has started to make occasional solo appearances, playing at the 2006 and 2007 Small Faces Conventions and playing at charity events in aid of Cancer Research and the British Thyroid Foundation. He performed again with Secret Affair at The Isle of Wight Scooter Rally, on 22 August, The Astoria 2, London, on 13 September 2008 and The Small Faces Convention, Islington Academy, 21 September 2008. In July 2011, Dave Cairns and Secret Affair were invited to re-record 'Time For Action' for Save the Children and the new recording (produced by Ian Page) spearheaded the charity's campaign for health workers in poor countries resulting in 42,000 petition signatures and presented to David Cameron at 10 Downing Street, Sept 2011. On 5 December 2011 Dave Cairns appeared as a guest on BBC2 TV show, \\"Never Mind The Buzzcocks\\" (season 25, episode 10) hosted by Cilla Black with panel captains, Phill Jupitus and Noel Fielding and guests, Rizzle Kicks, Tiffany Stevenson, Holly Willoughby, Angelos Epithemiou to an audience of over two million UK viewers. Dave Cairns continues to perform regularly with Secret Affair from 2009 to the current day playing UK dates and shows in 2011 Dublin, Madrid & Moscow, Tokyo and with 2012 shows in Siena, Glasgow, M-Fest Leeds, and a 13-date tour of the UK ending at The 229 Club London on 24 November 2012. Secret Affair released their fourth studio album, Soho Dreams, after a 30-year absence, on their I-SPY Records label on 10 September 2012 and continued to tour throughout 2014. 'Est 1979' The Sony BMG Secret Affair 35th Anniversary 4 album box set was released in January 2015. Secret Affair will be celebrating their 40th anniversary in 2019 with a 14-date UK spring tour.

It is the twelfth book in the series of Deathlands. Plot Synopsis Having narrowly escaped the self-destruction of the last redoubt they jumped to, Ryan Cawdor and his friends find themselves in the southwestern desert somewhere near the border of New Mexico and Texas. The group sets out South, hoping to find food and supplies, and possibly surviving \\"freezies\\" in a cryonics facility that the late Rick Ginsberg believed was located in the area. Soon the group comes to a prosperous ranch and are nearly shot by the residents, who have mistaken them for members of a local group of raiders. Once Ryan convinces the residents that they are not in any way associated with Skullface, the feared leader of the raiders, they are cautiously welcomed in. The ranch belongs to the Ballinger family, consisting of a widowed father, his two sons, and his daughter. The daughter, Christina, takes an immediate liking to Jak Lauren, but is impeded by her verbally and physically abusive father. That evening the men of the family are revealed to be serial rapists and murderers: the two brothers enter the room housing Krysty Wroth and Mildred Wyeth, plainly stating their intent to rape and kill them, while the father keeps armed watch outside. The women are able to kill the brothers while Jak silently kills their father. Christina, upon learning of the death of the rest of her family, says only one thing: \\"good.\\" Continuing south, the companions link up with a West-bound wagon train, where they serve as scouts and protection against hostile mutants who roam the area. After several days of travel they bring the settlers to a seemingly abandoned town, but while most of the companions are out scouting for additional supplies the town's current residents return: Skullface and his gang of raiders. Everyone but the scouting party is captured, including Mildred and Dr. Theophilus Tanner. Doc is shaken to the core when he recognizes Skullface as none other than former sec-boss Cort Strasser. Strasser attempts to draw out Ryan and his friends, first by organizing a sweep of the town, then later by arranging a murderous lottery in revenge for the six gang members killed by Ryan and his friends during the sweep. Acting on Mildred's cue, the uncaptured companions attack during the final stages of the lottery. They kill more than half of Strasser's remaining gang, but not before those same men kill fully half the wagon train settlers in the chaotic firefight. The six companions reunite and head off after Strasser. The pursuit is long and marked by violence, with the companions narrowly evading ambushes and attacks as they pursue Strasser by railcar, then foot, and eventually on rafts down the wild flowing waters of the Grandee. Strasser takes Mildred hostage during one encounter and flees with her to a heavily damaged redoubt; his gang is completely wiped out by the time he reaches it, leaving him alone with Mildred. After the chase winds through the ruins of the redoubt, and after Strasser tries and fails (with Mildred's intervention) to kill Ryan with a long-range sniper rifle, Cort convinces Ryan to agree to a fight to the death, armed only with knives, to bring the pursuit to a final end. The fight takes place on a rapidly decaying wire bridge over perilous terrain riddled with quicksand, which greatly hampers both fighters. Finally Ryan deliberately causes the bridge to snap, dropping the two men to the ground below. Strasser lands in a quicksand pit, and as Ryan watches from relative safety Cort demands he be shot to end it quickly; Ryan refuses. Rather than face death by suffocation, Strasser slits his own throat. Although the redoubt is mostly destroyed, including the attached cryonics facility Ryan had hoped held survivors, the MAT-TRANS facility is undamaged. As the companions prepare to make the next jump Jak states that he is not going; Ryan correctly guesses that this is because Jak intends to stay with Christina Ballinger and start a family. Jak is given a fond farewell before he departs. The rest of the group enters the chamber and makes the jump to the next location. Cultural references The lottery Cort Strasser organizes directly references the short story \\"The Lottery\\" a number of times, notably as the first person who volunteer to take a stone is named Shirley Jackson.

It is named after the Tauride (Tavrichesky) Palace in St Petersburg, where it was kept from the end of the eighteenth century until the mid-nineteenth. It is now in the Hermitage Museum. It shows the goddess rising from her bath (with a column on the right on the piece, to her left-hand side, with her towel or clothing draped over it). It lost both arms in antiquity and her nose has been restored, but is otherwise complete (including an elaborate ancient hairstyle popular amongst classical upper-class women, with locks falling down onto her shoulders, and an original ankle bracelet on her left ankle). It was thought to be a 2nd-century AD Roman copy from a Greek original, but recent research suggests it is in fact a Greek original dating from the 3rd or 2nd century BC. It is by an unknown sculptor, who takes inspiration from the Aphrodite of Cnidus (particularly of the Capitoline Venus type) but does not follow it strictly (the Tauride Venus, though well- proportioned and fully nude as in the exemplar, is slighter in build and of a more refined beauty than the exemplar). It was ceded by Pope Clement XI to Peter I in Rome in 1718, after protracted diplomatic negotiations: though a peasant had offered it to the zar's agent, the Pope had vetoed the exportation; he relented only when the zar proposed to exchange it with the relics of Bridget of Sweden; they were in Revel, today called Tallinn, which the Russians had just conquered.

This is a species of medium-sized sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Calyptraeidae, the slipper snails and cup and saucer snails. Description 10 fresh shells of Crepidula fornicata The size of the shell is 20–50 mm. The maximum recorded shell length is 56 mm.Welch J. J. (2010). \\"The \\"Island Rule\\" and Deep-Sea Gastropods: Re- Examining the Evidence\\". PLoS ONE 5(1): e8776. . This sea snail has an arched, rounded shell. On the inside of the shell there is a white \\"deck\\", which causes the shell to resemble a boat or a slipper, hence the common names. There is variability in the shape of the shell: some shells are more arched than others. Groups of individuals are often found heaped up and fastened together, with the larger, older females below and the smaller, younger males on top. As a heap grows, the males turn into females (making them sequential hermaphrodites). Distribution The species is native to the western Atlantic Ocean, specifically the Eastern coast of North America. Its distribution ranges from 48°N to 25°N; 97.2°W to 25°W from as far north as Nova Scotia to as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. It has been introduced accidentally to other parts of the world and has become problematic. Nonindigenous distribution Five views of a shell of Crepidula fornicata It was introduced to the state of Washington. The species was, however, brought to Europe together with the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. In Belgium, the first slipper limpet was found on September 28, 1911, attached to an oyster in Ostend, and since the 1930s it is seen as a common species along the Belgian coast. The species is considered an invasive species in Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom, and has also spread to Norway and Sweden.Global Invasive Species Database It is known to damage oyster fisheries. The slipper limpet has few to no predators in Europe, and can thrive on several types of hard bottoms and shellfish banks. A continued expansion to the north is probably inhibited by temperature: low temperatures during the winter can slow down or inhibit the development of the slipper limpet. It has also been introduced to the Pacific Northwest and Japan. Human consumption=Culinary use Although considered an invasive species, there are attempts to harvest and market the snail in France. Ecology=Habitat This is a common snail, usually found intertidally, infralittoral and circalittoral and in estuaries. Minimum recorded depth is 0 m. Maximum recorded depth is 70 m. They are often found, sometimes living stacked on top of one another, on rocks, on horseshoe crabs, shells and on dock pilings. Feeding habits Generally for Calyptraeidae, feeding habits include planktonic and minute detrital food items through either suspension or deposit feeding. Life cycle The species is a sequential hermaphrodite. The largest and oldest animals, at the base of a pile are female, the younger and smaller animals at the top are male. If the females in the stack die, the largest of the males will become a female.Global Invasive Species Database References This article incorporates CC-BY- SA-3.0 text from the reference Gofas, S.

After having appeared on The Edge of Night, his next role was as Scott Phillips on Search for Tomorrow (1969 to 1979). He left Search For Tomorrow and was replaced by actor Peter Ratray. He then appeared as Ian MacFarland on As the World Turns in 1979. In 1981, he began playing his most high-profile daytime role as Dr. Ed Bauer on the long-running soap opera Guiding Light.

However, Simon publicly expressed disapproval during a controversial storyline that unfolded in 2003 and 2004. The storyline (regarding mysterious characters Maryanne and Carrie Carruthers) received criticism for revising past show history, and drew disdain from Simon in the press regarding a particular scene where it was written that Ed had to strike his daughter.

Simon made a final return to Guiding Light along with the actors that played his daughter Michelle Bauer Santos (Nancy St. Alban) and son-in-law Danny Santos (Paul Anthony Stewart), in June 2009, appearing several times prior to the show's final episodes in September 2009.  Theater  Simon has done theater work as an actor and a playwright. His play, Sabbat, received its world premiere at his alma mater, Williams College, in 1968, directed by Keith Fowler, who was then a Williams faculty member. Among his New York theater appearances are roles in productions of P.S. Your Cat Is Dead off-Broadway, as well as a New York Shakespeare Festival production of \\"Twelfth Night\\".  Personal life  Simon's first marriage to Merle Louise, with whom he had three children, ended in divorce. He married Search for Tomorrow co-star Courtney Simon in 1975, and the couple share five children (some from prior marriages, as well as one born to the couple, Kate Hall, who is a daytime soap writer just like her mother).

The area encompassing Golden Ears, Edge Peak and Blanshard Peak (Blanshard Needle) was originally called The Golden Eyries, and the name was corrupted to Golden Ears. The similarity of the peak with the double summit to ears led people to believe that this mountain had the name Golden Ears. In the 1930s or 1940s the government of the day renamed the entire area to Mount Blanshard, and gave Edge Peak its name, named the southernmost summit Blanshard Peak, and conferred the official name Golden Ears to the peak with the twin summit. Current editions of the NTC map 92G/07 and 92G/08 have the label Mount Blanchard since the Golden Ears group lies on the border between these two maps.

It was written by Laurence James under the house name James Axler. Synopsis Following immediately from the events at the end of Seedling, Ryan Cawdor completes his rescue of his ten-year-old son Dean, with the assistance of his friends Krysty Wroth, Dr. Theophilus Tanner, J. B. Dix, and Mildred Wyeth. They make their escape in the recce wag \\"borrowed\\" from Newyork \\"King of the Underworld\\" Harry Stanton, narrowly escaping the well organized group of scalie slavers seeking to recapture Dean. Eventually they make their way to the hidden redoubt in the heart of the ville, and make a MAT-TRANS jump after fending off an attack by members of the late Dred's Hawks gang. The jump is especially rough, leaving only Ryan conscious and functional once the companions make their arrival. He soon discovers that the redoubt beyond the door is occupied by members of a highly organized sec force, who immediately order the group's unconditional surrender via intercom. Ryan closes the door barely in time to prevent their death by gunfire, sending them on another jump. Afterward, Ryan reflects that the strange lightness he felt could have been due to lower-than-Earth gravity, fitting with at least one other possibly extraterran jump the companions have made recently; he keeps this reflection to himself. The next jump takes the group to a small but well-stocked redoubt, allowing them to replenish on ammo and supplies as well as replace clothing and weapons. Ryan also discovers a pre-nuke scrap of paper with handwritten numbers and abbreviations that he pockets, intending to examine it later. Two days later they exit the redoubt, finding themselves in a swampy jungle that Mildred guesses may be Florida. They make their way to the well-kept remains of a large theme park and are met (and disarmed at gunpoint) by the local ville's sec-boss, Kelly, who confirms their location. He takes the companions to see the ville's baron, Boss Larry, who J. B. and Ryan recognize as a very obese Larry Zapp; years prior, while riding with the Trader, J. B. and Ryan severely beat and crippled Larry following his attempt to bribe a member of the Trader's group into betraying him. During this explanation Zapp says that he knows the Trader to still be alive, which Ryan and J. B. refuse to believe. Though Larry was crippled for life, he ultimately agrees with Ryan that his beating was not unprovoked, and assures Ryan he will not have anyone in the group killed or otherwise harmed. The companions' apparent safety is short lived; a man named Adam Traven interrupts the meeting, and is immediately recognized by most of the group as a dangerous sociopath. Kelly later explains that Traven controls Zapp by supplying him with dreem, a highly addictive narcotic, as well as the services of Traven's harem of dreem-addicted followers. During the meeting Adam takes an obvious and sinister interest in Dean. The next day Ryan is called to meet with Boss Larry again, whereupon Traven demands Cawdor give him his son in exchange for the remaining companions' guaranteed safe exodus from the ville. Ryan stalls, telling Adam he will give him his answer the following day. Around the same time Ryan is able to decipher the pre-nuke note from the redoubt, and concludes it contains address codes for specific redoubts, in particular including the New Mexico redoubt near where Jak Lauren settled with his wife. Thus the companions decide to take Dean to stay with Jak for a few days, ensuring his safety while they take care of Traven who, as Ryan says, \\"needs chilling\\". He departs that night with his son for the redoubt. Ryan's theory proves correct, and the jump takes him and Dean to the still intact MAT-TRANS below the obliterated New Mexico redoubt. After a tense, long chase with some mutated coyotes, the two Cawdors reach Jak's farm. Jak readily agrees to watch over Dean, claiming he has a \\"blood debt\\" to Ryan. During the visit Ryan discovers Jak has a working two-way shortwave radio, and agrees to try to keep in touch using his own handheld unit (given to him by a heavily drugged Larry Zapp). Once Ryan returns to the ville things begin to go downhill quickly. Kelly makes a move against Adam and his followers, but his plan fails and he is brutally executed by being thrown off the top of a freefall-themed ride to his death. Traven is furious at Dean's supposed abduction by swamp dwellers, clearly not believing the story but not acting against Ryan. Instead he takes Doc Tanner hostage under the guise of \\"questioning\\", specifically over the disappearance of one of Traven's followers. Unbeknownst to Traven, the missing woman, Sky, was killed by Tanner after he discovered (mid-coitus) that the \\"dark snaking\\" she had mentioned participating in was actually the brutal murder of a wrinklie. Ryan learns this before he meets with Adam; he negotiates safe passage for everyone in exchange for his participation in another \\"dark snaking\\" that evening. Ryan is brought along armed only with his knife and panga. During the evening's kill, the slaughter of a family of four, Ryan is able to destroy the house's electrical box, plunging the house into near-pitch darkness. In the confusion he kills seven of Traven's eight followers; Adam and the other survivor retreat to the ville's center. Now accompanied by the rest of his friends, Ryan follows Traven, carrying out an assault that ends with all of Traven's supporters either fleeing or dead and Traven using Doc as a human shield. Distracted by facing off with the companions, Adam fails to see Larry Zapp rise to his feet (with considerable difficulty) behind him, and is forced to release Doc Tanner when Zapp simply falls forward onto Traven, trapping him under his enormous weight. Zapp soon after dies, shot multiple times at point blank range by the panicking Traven. Ryan and J. B. roll Larry's corpse off of Adam, then ensure his slow demise by shooting him in the knees, elbows, and stomach and then leaving him to his fate. The group makes the jump to the New Mexico redoubt, spurned on by mostly unintelligible but urgent messages from Jak received on the portable two-way. When they arrive Jak is waiting to meet them, and tells Ryan that while he was gone Dean was captured by a band of slavers, who departed through the MAT-TRANS. He also is able to tell Ryan who is leading the slavers, someone Ryan has crossed paths with two times prior: Zimyanin.

He was the older brother of John S. Fullmer, another politician. Fullmer was a person of some importance in the early Latter Day Saint movement. Early childhood and career David Fullmer spent his childhood and early adult years on his family's farm in Chillisquaque, Northumberland County. In 1830, his father, Peter Fullmer, moved the family from Pennsylvania to Jefferson Township, Richland County, Ohio. Fullmer was brought up on a farm and received a common-school education. In addition to farming, he also taught school and went into merchandising. In September 1831, Fullmer married Rhoda Ann Marvin, daughter of Zera Marvin and Rhoda Williams. In 1835 he moved to Richmond County, Ohio, upon hearing the message of Mormonism. Fullmer was baptized September 16, 1836, by Elder Henry G. Sherwood. Involvement in early Mormonism In early 1837, Fullmer traveled to Kirtland, Ohio, where he met Joseph Smith for the first time. Shortly afterward he was ordained an elder under the hands of Reuben Hedlock in the Kirtland Temple; he also received a patriarchal blessing from Patriarch Joseph Smith, Sr. In September 1837, he removed to Caldwell County, Missouri, to be near the site that Joseph Smith had revealed as the principal gathering place of the Saints. In the spring of 1838 he moved to Daviess County in the same state. The following summer he had a severe attack of sickness which threatened his life, but his health was restored. With mounting opposition between the newcomer Latter-day Saints and the \\"old settlers\\" of Missouri, and after Missouri Governor Lilburn W. Boggs issued Missouri Executive Order 44, he was compelled with the rest of the Saints to leave his home and possessions in Missouri, under threat of death. With the Saints, he went to the state of Illinois, where he left his family and then continued to Ohio to assist in moving his father to Illinois. He and his family eventually settled in Nauvoo, Illinois. During this time, Fullmer was ordained to the office of high priest in 1839 and appointed to the high council in the Nauvoo Stake. His sister, Desdemona Wadsworth Fullmer Smith, married Joseph Smith as one of his plural wives during this time. In 1844, Fullmer was appointed to be one of the electioneering missionaries in behalf of Joseph Smith's candidacy for President of the United States. He was engaged in this labor and in preaching in the state of Michigan when he received news of the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. Fullmer immediately returned to his home in Nauvoo and attended the general meeting of the Church, at which the claims of Sidney Rigdon to be guardian of the Church were rejected by vote of the conference, and the Twelve Apostles, with Brigham Young presiding, were sustained as the pro temp leaders of the Church. In the ensuing schism, Fullmer, along with a majority of the Saints, would side with Brigham Young as the rightful successor to the presidency and prophetic mantle of Joseph Smith. Plural marriage After having been married for fourteen years to Rhoda Marvin, Fuller entered into polygamist marriages with Margaret Phillips and Sarah Oysterbanks in Nauvoo. On 19 January 1846, all three wives were sealed to him, for eternity, in the then-newly completed Nauvoo Temple. Fullmer divorced Margaret Phillips in 1848, without the two having had any known children. With his other two wives, however, Fullmer had twenty children altogether: eleven with Rhoda Marvin, and nine with Sarah Oysterbanks. Civic, theocratic, and ecclesiastical engagements Fullmer was a member of the Nauvoo City Council, and later, after the Illinois Legislature repealed the Nauvoo city charter, he was elected to the town council of Nauvoo. He was also a member of the Council of Fifty, a theocratic representation of and preparation for what Joseph Smith perceived as the impending Millennial Kingdom of Jesus Christ. Expulsion and trek to Utah In the winter of 1846, with the Saints threatened with expulsion from Nauvoo, Brigham Young led church members into the western frontier to find a new home for the Saints. Fullmer was appointed \\"captain\\" over a company of one hundred pioneers, Brigham Young organizing the traveling Saints after the camp of Israel described in the Book of Exodus. In 1846, it was decided that a temporary settlement was needed as a resting place for the rear company of Saints and all those who, from lack of means, were unable to proceed further. To this end, Garden Grove, Iowa was established, with Samuel Bent appointed as president and Fullmer as his first counselor. Here the exiled Saints made a large farm and worked together to raise grain. There were many poor among them who were destitute for food and clothing. When President Bent died shortly after the settlement was established, the presidency passed to Fullmer. He sent missionaries out along the great rivers to solicit aid for the relief of the poor, and by this means some help was obtained. The company moved to another temporary settlement called Winter Quarters, Nebraska, on the Missouri River, before making their way to present-day Utah. After arriving to the main settlement then known as Great Salt Lake City, Fullmer was appointed first counselor to Daniel Spencer, president of the Salt Lake Stake, in 1849. At this time, when Church leaders also served as community leaders, there was a fusion of church and state, Fullmer continuing his role in the theocratic government known as the Council of Fifty. Fullmer continued his overland travels in service to his church and people. For five months during the winter, he journeyed south with an exploring expedition, serving as counselor to Parley P. Pratt. Fullmer would later serve as captain over a relief company, traveling east to Independence Rock to assist a company of Saints who were journeying westward. When the territory of Utah was created, Fullmer was elected a member of the legislature for Salt Lake County, and at various times served in other civic positions, such as treasurer of the University of Deseret, treasurer pro temp of Salt Lake County, treasurer of Salt Lake City, delegate to one of the early territorial conventions, director of the Agricultural Society, and home missionary. Stake president In 1852, stake president Daniel Spencer was called on a mission to Great Britain, and Fullmer became acting president of the stake (1852–56). In the general church conference held April 7, 1853, David Fullmer was formally sustained as the fourth president of the Salt Lake Stake. A special conference was convened under the direction of President Brigham Young on August 13, 1853, at which time Thomas Rhoads and Phineas H. Young were sustained as Fullmer's counselors. When community problems arose they were often solved by the local church leaders. For example, a resolution of the brethren of the Mill Creek Ward passed on January 29, 1853, explained the necessity of calling a general meeting for discussion of uniform prices for agricultural products and standard wages for mechanical labor and related services. Such a meeting was subsequently held on February 3, 1853, where the \\"Deseret Agricultural Society\\" was formed for the purpose of carrying out the resolutions of the farmers. During the three and a half years President Fullmer presided over Salt Lake Stake he organized two new wards: 5th Ward (previously authorized, but not made an active ward until 1853) and the Sugar House Ward in 1854. The stake then had a total of twenty-nine wards when President Spencer returned. None of the wards had been transferred or discontinued. President Fullmer appointed four members of the high council during his presidency and twenty new bishops. As the officers of Salt Lake Stake were presented during the semiannual conference of the Church held October 8, 1853, as was the usual practice, it was reported that there were three members of the First Presidency and nine members of the Council of the Twelve who resided and had their membership in Salt Lake Stake. Members of the Council of the Twelve attended the annual meeting of the 14th Ward on December 26, 1853. After certain matters of business were attended to and some spiritual talks given, dancing and social activities were enjoyed by all. Later life, death Several years before his death, Fullmer was ordained a patriarch. David Fullmer died at his home on October 21, 1879 at 11:20 PM of causes incident to age. He was 76 years of age. His funeral was on Thursday, October 23, 1879, in the Salt Lake Sixth Ward Chapel, at 1 PM, with several prominent members of the LDS Church in attendance. He was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery in the Family Plot.

History The 11th Army was established on 5 October 1940 as \\"Kommandostab Leipzig\\", but changed its designation to Kommandostab München on 23 April 1941. It was restructured into Heeresgruppe Don on 21 November 1942. After being reformed on 26 January 1945 and taking part in various counter-offensives against the Soviet and US advance, the army surrendered to American troops on 23 April 1945. Formation The 11th Army was activated in 1940 to prepare for the forthcoming German attack on the Soviet Union. The 11th Army was part of Army Group South when it invaded the USSR during Operation Barbarossa. In September 1941, Erich von Manstein was appointed its commander. His predecessor, Colonel-General Eugen Ritter von Schobert, perished when his Fiesler Storch aircraft landed in a Soviet minefield. At the start of Barbarossa, the 11th Army order of battle included: *LIV Corps ** 50th Infantry division ** 170th Infantry division ** 138th Artillery brigade ** 190th Assault Gun battalion ** 197th Assault Gun battalion ** 46th Combat Engineer battalion ** 744th Combat Engineer battalion ** 454th Corps Signal battalion *XXX Corps ** 198th Infantry division ** 14th Infantry division (Romanian) ** 5th Cavalry brigade (Romanian) ** 249th Assault Gun battalion ** 610th Anti-aircraft Artillery battalion ** 70th Nebelwerfer battalion (150 mm mortars 280 mm guns) ** 110th Artillery brigade ** 690th Field Engineer regiment ** 430th Corps Signal battalion ** 430th Corps Supply battalion ** 430th Corps Cartographic battalion * XI Corps ** 76th Infantry division ** 239th Infantry division * Army reserves and other assets ** 22nd Infantry division ** Railroad operations command ** 19th Construction brigade ** 300th Tank battalion ** 617th Cartography battalion ** 756th Traffic controllers battalion ** 766th Artillery regiment ** 926th Construction command ** 558th Army Communications regiment ** 693rd Propaganda company The 11th Army was tasked with invading the Crimea and the pursuit of enemy forces on the flank of Army Group South during its advance into the Soviet Union. The 11th Army order of battle included three Corps: XXX Corps, which was composed of the 22nd, 72nd and Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler divisions and the XI Corps, consisting of the 170th Infantry Division and the 1st and 4th Mountain Divisions; and LIVth Corps, consisting of the 46th, 73rd and 50th Infantry Divisions. The latter formation had been in charge of the advance into the Crimean peninsula earlier in September. The Romanian 3rd Army, three Mountain brigades and three cavalry brigades, were also under von Manstein's command. Einsatzgruppe D was attached to the 11th Army. Battle of Sevastopol The 11th Army fought in southern USSR from 1941 until mid-summer 1942 and laid siege to Sevastopol. It did not take part in Fall Blau when Army Group South attacked in Southern Russia towards the Caucasus and Stalingrad. The 11th Army cut the Soviets off from the sea at Sevastopol, thus sealing the fate of the remaining defenders. After a 248-day-long siege, an estimated 100,000 prisoners marched into captivity. For his achievements in this battle, Manstein was promoted to field marshal. A grateful Adolf Hitler also authorized the Crimean Shield to commemorate the efforts of the 11th Army. It was a costly victory, however: the 11th Army's casualties and material losses were so high it was no longer a viable fighting force in its own right.Robert Forczyk, Sevastopol 1942: Von Manstein's triumph, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2008, p.90. Manstein recommended that the 11th Army either cross the straits of Kerch and push into the Kuban area to aid in the capture of Rostov, or be placed into Army Group South reserve. Instead, part of the 11th Army, along with the heavy siege train, was transferred to Army Group North. Ordered to oversee Leningrad's reduction, Manstein transferred with them. The remainder of the 11th Army was parcelled out to Army Group Center and Army Group South. This breakup of the 11th Army and its disappearance from the order of battle of Army Group South would have dire consequences for Nazi Germany. During the course of the following fall and winter of 1942, the Battle of Stalingrad took place. The Luftwaffe had largely reduced the city to rubble and the presence of the Volga behind the city made it virtually impossible for the Germans to follow the classical dual pincer envelopment strategy. The Red Army now opted 'hugging' tactics, (keeping the front lines as close to the Axis forces as possible), thereby rendering tanks, aircraft, and artillery largely redundant, and placing the entire responsibility on the infantry. Although the 6th Army had managed to capture most of the city and had pushed the Soviets to the banks of the Volga river in several places, it needed several more infantry divisions (as explained above), to take the city completely. In spite of repeated requests to the German high command, the 6th Army was not reinforced because no other reinforcements were available in the region, or close enough to support them. As the battle grew more intense, the Soviets counterattacked on both sides of the 6th Army's flanks and destroyed the Romanian 3rd and 4th Armies. The Soviet pincers then linked up, thereby surrounding and ultimately destroying the 6th Army. The 11th Army was de-activated on 21 November 1942 and was used to form the newly created Army Group Don. Order of Battle During the Battle for Sevastopol The 11th Army, during the battle of Sevastopol, consisted of nine German infantry divisions (including two taken on strength during the battle), in two corps, and two Romanian rifle corps, plus various supporting elements, including 150 tanks, several hundred aircraft and one of the heaviest concentrations of artillery fielded by the Wehrmacht. *LIV Corps **22nd Infantry Division - commanded by General der Infanterie Ludwig Wolff **24th Infantry Division **50th Infantry Division **132nd Infantry Division *XXX Corps - commanded by General der Infanterie Hans von Salmuth **28th Light Division **72nd Infantry Division **170th Infantry Division *Romanian Mountain Corps - commanded by Major General Gheorghe Avramescu **1st Mountain Division **4th Mountain Division **18th Infantry Division October 1944 to April 1945 The 11th SS Panzer Army (SS panzer-Armeeoberkommando 11. ), was not much more than a paper formation formed between November 1944 and February 1945 by Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler while he was commander of Army Group Vistula.The historian Antony Beevor wrote that, when the 11th SS Panzer Army was created, the available units could constitute a corps at best, \\"'But panzer army' observed Eismann 'has a better ring to it'\\". It also allowed Himmler to promote SS officers to senior staff and field commands within the formation. Obergruppenführer Felix Steiner, probably the best SS officer available, was named its commander.Beevor p.88 The formation was officially listed as the 11th Army but it was also known as SS Panzer-Armeeoberkommando 11.Tessin p.?? and is often referred to in English as the 11th SS Panzer Army. After fighting east of the Oder River during February 1945, the 11th was assigned to OB West, reorganized, and given command of new units, for combat against the Western Allies in March 1945. After fighting in the vicinity of the Weser River and the Harz mountains, the 11th surrendered on April 21.

Tyler III (May 21, 1750 – April 29, 1832), a veteran of the Battle of Bunker Hill, and Sarah Edwards Tyler (July 11, 1761 – April 25, 1841), granddaughter of Jonathan Edwards.Warner, Ezra J.

Tyler who would also serve as a general in the Civil War. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1819. He became an authority on artillery and an honest inspector of arms of private contractors, which appears not to have helped him advance above first lieutenant in rank. Daniel Tyler married Emily Lee of Norwich, Connecticut on May 18, 1832. They had five children; Alfred Lee, Gertrude, Edmund Leighton, Mary Law, and Augustus Cleveland. Gertrude was the mother of Edith Carow Roosevelt, wife of President Theodore Roosevelt. http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=26. Tyler resigned his commission in the United States Army in May 1834 and became an iron manufacturer, developing blast furnaces and rolling mills. He was the president of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad and, for five years, the Macon and Western Railroad in Georgia. Later, Tyler served as the superintending engineer of the Dauphin and Susquehanna Railroad and the affiliated Allentown Railroad, and became president and engineer when the former was reorganized as the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Railroad. He had greater success in the railroad industry than he had in the manufacture of pig iron. American Civil War service At the start of the Civil War, Tyler volunteered to be an aide- de-camp to Brig. Gen. Robert Patterson in April 1861. He served briefly as the colonel of the 1st Connecticut Infantry. He was appointed brigadier general in the Connecticut Militia on May 10, 1861 and commanded a division in Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell's Army of Northeastern Virginia, with which he fought in the First Battle of Bull Run. Tyler was mustered out on August 11, 1861.Eicher, 2001, p. 539. Though he has been assigned a substantial portion of the blame for the Union disaster at Bull Run, he was appointed to the rank of brigadier general of volunteers on March 13, 1862. He was sent to the west and commanded a brigade in the Army of the Mississippi between May 1, 1862 and July 22, 1862 during the Siege of Corinth. At the Battle of Harpers Ferry on September 15, 1862, Tyler's division surrendered to the forces of Confederate Lieutenant General Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson.Heidler, David S., and Jeanne T.

The Union soldiers, who were paroled after their capture, were sent to Camp Douglas, which already had been used as a prisoner of war camp for Confederates captured at the Battle of Fort Donelson, for temporary detention. Under the terms of the prisoner exchanged cartel then in effect, they had to await formal exchange before they could leave the camp. These 8,000 paroled Union soldiers began to arrive at Camp Douglas on September 28, 1862 and Tyler took temporary command of the camp. Under Tyler's command these Union soldiers had to live under similar conditions to those endured by the Confederate prisoners from Fort Donelson. In fact, the conditions were worse because the camp had become filthy and even more run down during its occupancy by the prisoners. The parolees had a two-month stay at the camp. Tyler was relieved as commander on November 20, 1862. Later, Tyler commanded at Baltimore, at Harper's Ferry between June 13, 1863 and July 3, 1864, and finally at the District of Delaware between July 3, 1863 and January 19, 1864. Aftermath Tyler resigned his commission in the Union Army on April 6, 1864, then being older than the retirement age of 65, and moved to New Jersey. Then, in the 1870s, he moved to Alabama and founded the town of Anniston, named for his daughter-in-law. He established an iron manufacturing company and was president of the Mobile and Montgomery Railroad. He also acquired large tracts of land in Guadalupe County, Texas.Warner, 1964, p. 515 Daniel Tyler died while visiting New York City on November 30, 1882. He is buried in Hillside Cemetery, at Anniston, Alabama. Tyler's granddaughter, Edith Carow Roosevelt would later become First Lady of the United States after her marriage to Theodore Roosevelt. His nephew, Robert O. Tyler, was also a brigadier general in the Union Army.

In recent years, these studies have increasingly involved the use of modern scientific techniques and instruments, such as fMRI and EEG which are able to directly observe brain physiology and neural activity in living subjects, either during the act of meditation itself, or before and after a meditation effort, thus allowing linkages to be established between meditative practice and changes in brain structure or function. Since the 1950s hundreds of studies on meditation have been conducted, but many of the early studies were flawed and thus yielded unreliable results. Contemporary studies have attempted to address many of these flaws with the hope of guiding current research into a more fruitful path. In 2013, researchers at Johns Hopkins, publishing in the Journal of the American Medical Association, identified 47 studies that qualify as well-designed and therefore reliable. Based on these studies, they concluded there is only a moderate evidence that mindfulness meditation programs can reduce anxiety, depression, and pain, but no evidence that it was more effective than active treatments, such as drugs or exercise. Others studies cautioned about possible misinformation and misinterpretation of data related to the subject. The process of meditation, as well as its effects, is a growing subfield of neurological research. Modern scientific techniques and instruments, such as fMRI and EEG, have been used to study how regular meditation affects individuals by measuring brain and bodily changes. Difficulties in the scientific study of meditation=Weaknesses in historic meditation and mindfulness research A comparison of the effect of various meditation techniques on systolic blood pressure. In June, 2007 the United States National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) published an independent, peer-reviewed, meta-analysis of the state of meditation research, conducted by researchers at the University of Alberta Evidence-based Practice Center. The report reviewed 813 studies involving five broad categories of meditation: mantra meditation, mindfulness meditation, yoga, T'ai chi, and Qigong, and included all studies on adults through September 2005, with a particular focus on research pertaining to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and substance abuse. The report concluded: It noted that there is no theoretical explanation of health effects from meditation common to all meditation techniques. A version of this report subsequently published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine in 2008 stated: \\"Most clinical trials on meditation practices are generally characterized by poor methodological quality with significant threats to validity in every major quality domain assessed.\\" This was despite a statistically significant increase in quality of all reviewed meditation research, in general, over time between 1956 and 2005. Of the 400 clinical studies, 10% were found to be good quality. A call was made for rigorous study of meditation. These authors also noted that this finding is not unique to the area of meditation research and that the quality of reporting is a frequent problem in other areas of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) research and related therapy research domains. Of more than 3,000 scientific studies that were found in a comprehensive search of 17 relevant databases, only about 4% had randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which are designed to exclude the placebo effect. In a 2013 meta-analysis, Awasthi argued that meditation is defined poorly and despite the research studies showing clinical efficacy, exact mechanisms of action remain unclear. A 2017 commentary was similarly mixed, with concerns including the particular characteristics of individuals who tend to participate in mindfulness and meditation research. Position statements A 2013 statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) evaluated the evidence for the effectiveness of TM as a treatment for hypertension as \\"unknown/unclear/uncertain or not well-established\\", and stated: \\"Because of many negative studies or mixed results and a paucity of available trials... other meditation techniques are not recommended in clinical practice to lower BP at this time.\\" According to the AHA, while there are promising results about the impact of meditation in reducing blood pressure and managing insomnia, depression and anxiety, it is not a replacement for healthy lifestyle changes and is not a substitute for effective medication. Methodological obstacles The term meditation encompasses a wide range of practices and interventions rooted in different traditions, but research literature has sometimes failed to adequately specify the nature of the particular meditation practice(s) being studied. Different forms of meditation practice may yield different results depending on the factors being studied. The presence of a number of intertwined factors including the effects of meditation, the theoretical orientation of how meditation practices are taught, the cultural background of meditators, and generic group effects complicates the task of isolating the effects of meditation: Research on mindfulness A previous study commissioned by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that meditation interventions reduce multiple negative dimensions of psychological stress. Other systematic reviews and meta-analyses show that mindfulness meditation has several mental health benefits such as bringing about reductions in depression symptoms, improvements in mood, stress-resilience, and attentional control. Mindfulness interventions also appear to be a promising intervention for managing depression in youth. Mindfulness meditation is useful for managing stress, anxiety, and also appears to be effective in treating substance use disorders. A recent meta analysis by Hilton et al. (2016) including 30 randomized controlled trials found high quality evidence for improvement in depressive symptoms. Other review studies have shown that mindfulness meditation can enhance the psychological functioning of breast cancer survivors, is effective for people with eating disorders, and may also be effective in treating psychosis. Studies have also shown that rumination and worry contribute to mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety, and mindfulness-based interventions are effective in the reduction of worry. Some studies suggest that mindfulness meditation contributes to a more coherent and healthy sense of self and identity, when considering aspects such as sense of responsibility, authenticity, compassion, self-acceptance and character. Brain mechanisms In 2011, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) released findings from a study in which magnetic resonance images were taken of the brains of 16 participants 2 weeks before and after the participants joined the mindfulness meditation (MM) program by researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital, Bender Institute of Neuroimaging in Germany, and the University of Massachusetts Medical School. The researchers concluded: The analgesic effect of MM involves multiple brain mechanisms including the activation of the anterior cingulate cortex and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. In addition, brief periods of MM training increases the amount of grey matter in the hippocampus and parietal lobe. Other neural changes resulting from MM may increase the efficiency of attentional control. Participation in MBSR programmes has been found to correlate with decreases in right basolateral amygdala gray matter density, and increases in gray matter concentration within the left hippocampus. Changes in the brain Mindfulness meditation also appears to bring about favorable structural changes in the brain, though more research needs to be done because most of these studies are small and have weak methodology. One recent study found a significant cortical thickness increase in individuals who underwent a brief -8 weeks- MBSR training program and that this increase was coupled with a significant reduction of several psychological indices related to worry, state anxiety, depression. Another study describes how mindfulness based interventions target neurocognitive mechanisms of addiction at the attention-appraisal-emotion interface. A meta-analysis by Fox et al. (2014) using results from 21 brain imaging studies found consistent differences in the region of the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions associated with body awareness. In terms of effect size the mean effect was rated as moderate. (Cohen's d = 0.46) However the results should be interpreted with caution because funnel plots indicate that publication bias is an issue in meditation research. A follow up by Fox et al. (2016) using 78 functional neuro-imaging studies suggests that different meditation styles are reliably associated with different brain activity. Activations in some brain regions are usually accompanied by deactivation in others. This finding suggests that meditation research must put emphasis on comparing practices from the same style of meditation, for example results from studies investigating focused attention methods cannot be compared to results from open monitoring approaches. Attention and mindfulnessAttention networks and mindfulness meditation= Psychological and Buddhist conceptualisations of mindfulness both highlight awareness and attention training as key components, in which levels of mindfulness can be cultivated with practise of mindfulness meditation. Focused attention meditation (FAM) and open monitoring meditation (OMM) are distinct types of mindfulness meditation; FAM refers to the practice of intently maintaining focus on one object, whereas OMM is the progression of general awareness of one's surroundings while regulating thoughts. Focused attention meditation is typically practiced first to increase the ability to enhance attentional stability, and awareness of mental states with the goal being to transition to open monitoring meditation practise that emphasizes the ability to monitor moment-by-moment changes in experience, without a focus of attention to maintain. Mindfulness meditation may lead to greater cognitive flexibility. In an active randomized controlled study completed in 2019, participants who practiced mindfulness meditation demonstrated a greater improvement in awareness and attention that participants in the active control condition. Alpha wave neural oscillation power (which is normally associated with an alert resting state) has been shown to be increased by mindfulness in both healthy subjects and patients. =Evidence for improvements in three areas of attentionSustained attention Tasks of sustained attention relate to vigilance and the preparedness that aids completing a particular task goal. Psychological research into the relationship between mindfulness meditation and the sustained attention network have revealed the following: * Mindfulness meditators have demonstrated superior performance when the stimulus to be detected in a task was unexpected, relative to when it was expected. This suggests that attention resources were more readily available in order to perform well in the task. This was despite not receiving a visual cue to aid performance. (Valentine & Sweet, 1999). * In a continuous performance task an association was found between higher dispositional mindfulness and more stable maintenance of sustained attention. * In an EEG study, the Attentional blink effect was reduced, and P3b ERP amplitude decreased in a group of participants who completed a mindfulness retreat. The incidence of reduced attentional blink effect relates to an increase in detectability of a second target. This may have been due to a greater ability to allocate attentional resources for detecting the second target, reflected in a reduced P3b amplitude. * A greater degree of attentional resources may also be reflected in faster response times in task performance, as was found for participants with higher levels of mindfulness experience. Selective attention * Selective attention as linked with the orientation network, is involved in selecting the relevant stimuli to attend to. * Performance in the ability to limit attention to potentially sensory inputs (i.e. selective attention) was found to be higher following the completion of an 8-week MBSR course, compared to a one-month retreat and control group (with no mindfulness training). The ANT task is a general applicable task designed to test the three attention networks, in which participants are required to determine the direction of a central arrow on a computer screen. Efficiency in orienting that represent the capacity to selectively attend to stimuli was calculated by examining changes in the reaction time that accompanied cues indicating where the target occurred relative to the aid of no cues. * Meditation experience was found to correlate negatively with reaction times on an Eriksen flanker task measuring responses to global and local figures. Similar findings have been observed for correlations between mindfulness experience in an orienting score of response times taken from Attention Network Task performance. * Participants who engaged in the Meditation Breath Attention Score exercise performed better on anagram tasks and reported greater focused attention on this task compared to those who did not undergo this exercise. Executive control attention * Executive control attention include functions of inhibiting the conscious processing of distracting information. In the context of mindful meditation, distracting information relates to attention grabbing mental events such as thoughts related to the future or past. * More than one study have reported findings of a reduced Stroop effect following mindfulness meditation training. The Stroop effect indexes interference created by having words printed in colour that differ to the read semantic meaning e.g. green printed in red. However findings for this task are not consistently found. For instance the MBSR may differ to how mindful one becomes relative to a person who is already high in trait mindfulness. * Using the Attention Network Task (a version of Eriksen flanker task ) it was found that error scores that indicate executive control performance were reduced in experienced meditators and following a brief 5 session mindfulness training program. * A neuroimaging study supports behavioural research findings that higher levels of mindfulness are associated with greater proficiency to inhibit distracting information. As greater activation of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was shown for mindfulness meditators than matched controls. * Participants with at least 6 years of experience meditating performed better on the Stroop Test compared to participants who had not had experience meditating. The group of meditators also had lower reaction times during this test than the group of non- meditators. * Following a Stroop test, reduced amplitude of the P3 ERP component was found for a meditation group relative to control participants. This was taken to signify that mindfulness meditation improves executive control functions of attention. An increased amplitude in the N2 ERP component was also observed in the mindfulness meditation group, thought to reflect more efficient perceptual discrimination in earlier stages of perceptual processing.  Emotion regulation and mindfulness  Research shows meditation practices lead to greater emotional regulation abilities. Mindfulness can help people become more aware of thoughts in the present moment, and this increased self-awareness leads to better processing and control over one's responses to surroundings or circumstances. Positive effects of this heightened awareness include a greater sense of empathy for others, an increase in positive patterns of thinking, and a reduction in anxiety. Reductions in rumination also have been found following mindfulness meditation practice, contributing to the development of positive thinking and emotional well-being. =Evidence of mindfulness and emotion regulation outcomes= Emotional reactivity can be measured and reflected in brain regions related to the production of emotions. It can also be reflected in tests of attentional performance, indexed in poorer performance in attention related tasks. The regulation of emotional reactivity as initiated by attentional control capacities can be taxing to performance, as attentional resources are limited. * Patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) exhibited reduced amygdala activation in response to negative self-beliefs following an MBSR intervention program that involves mindfulness meditation practice. * The LPP ERP component indexes arousal and is larger in amplitude for emotionally salient stimuli relative to neutral. Individuals higher in trait mindfulness showed lower LPP responses to high arousal unpleasant images. These findings suggest that individuals with higher trait mindfulness were better able to regulate emotional reactivity to emotionally evocative stimuli. * Participants who completed a 7-week mindfulness training program demonstrated a reduction in a measure of emotional interference (measured as slower responses times following the presentation of emotional relative to neutral pictures). This suggests a reduction in emotional interference. * Following a MBSR intervention, decreases in social anxiety symptom severity were found, as well as increases in bilateral parietal cortex neural correlates. This is thought to reflect the increased employment of inhibitory attentional control capacities to regulate emotions. * Participants who engaged in emotion-focus meditation and breathing meditation exhibited delayed emotional response to negatively valanced film stimuli compared to participants who did not engage in any type of meditation. =Controversies in mindful emotion regulation= It is debated as to whether top-down executive control regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), are required or not to inhibit reactivity of the amygdala activation related to the production of evoked emotional responses. Arguably an initial increase in activation of executive control regions developed during mindfulness training may lessen with increasing mindfulness expertise. Stress reduction Research has shown stress reduction benefits from mindfulness. A 2019 study tested the effects of meditation on the psychological well-being, work stress, and blood pressure of employees working in the United Kingdom. One group of participants were instructed to meditate once a day using a mindfulness app on their smartphones, while the control group did not engage in meditation. Measurements of well-being, stress, and perceived workplace support were taken for both groups before the intervention and then again after 4 months. Based on self-report questionnaires, the participants who engaged in meditation showed a significant increase in psychological well-being and perceived workplace support. The meditators also reported a significant decrease in anxiety and stress levels. Other research shows decreased stress levels in people who engage in meditation after shorter periods of time as well. Evidence of significant stress reduction was found after only three weeks of meditation intervention. Brief, daily meditation sessions can alter one's behavioral response to stressors, improving coping mechanisms and decreasing the adverse impact caused be stress. A study from 2016 examined anxiety and emotional states of naive meditators before and after a 7-day meditation retreat in Thailand. Results displayed a significant reduction in perceived stress after this traditional Buddhist meditation retreat. Insomnia and sleep Chronic insomnia is often associated with anxious hyperarousal and frustration over inability to sleep. Mindfulness has been shown to reduce insomnia and improve sleep quality, although self-reported measures show larger effects than objective measures. Future directions A large part of mindfulness research is dependent on technology. As new technology continues to be developed, new imaging techniques will become useful in this field. Real-time fMRI might give immediate feedback and guide participants through the programs. It could also be used to more easily train and evaluate mental states during meditation itself. The new technology in the upcoming years offers many new opportunities for the continued research. Research on other types of meditation thumb Insight (Vipassana) meditation Vipassana meditation is a component of Buddhist practice. Phra Taweepong Inwongsakul and Sampath Kumar from the University of Mysore have been studying the effects of this meditation on 120 students by measuring the associated increase of cortical thickness in the brain. The results of this study are inconclusive. Vipassana meditation leads to more than just mindfulness, but has been found to reduce stress, increase well-being and self-kindness. These effects were found to be most powerful short-term, but still had a relatively significant impact 6 months later. In a study conducted by Szekeres and Wertheim (2014), they found stress to be the category that seemed to have the most regression, but the others contained higher prevalence when compared to the participants' original scores that were given from before embarking on Vipassana meditation. Overall, according to self-reports, Vipassana can have short and long-term effects on an individual. An essential component to the Vipassana mediation approach is the focus on awareness, referring to bodily sensations and psychological status. In a study conducted by Zeng et al. (2013), awareness was described as the acknowledgement of consciousness which is monitoring all aspects of the environment. This definition differentiates the concept of awareness from mindfulness. The emphasis on awareness, and the way it assists in monitoring emotion, is unique to this meditative practice. Sahaja yoga and mental silence Sahaja yoga meditation is regarded as a mental silence meditation, and has been shown to correlate with particular brain and brain wave characteristics. One study has led to suggestions that Sahaja meditation involves 'switching off' irrelevant brain networks for the maintenance of focused internalized attention and inhibition of inappropriate information. Sahaja meditators appear to benefit from lower depression and scored above control group for emotional well-being and mental health measures on SF-36 ratings. A study comparing practitioners of Sahaja Yoga meditation with a group of non-meditators doing a simple relaxation exercise, measured a drop in skin temperature in the meditators compared to a rise in skin temperature in the non-meditators as they relaxed. The researchers noted that all other meditation studies that have observed skin temperature have recorded increases and none have recorded a decrease in skin temperature. This suggests that Sahaja Yoga meditation, being a mental silence approach, may differ both experientially and physiologically from simple relaxation. Kundalini yoga Kundalini yoga has proved to increase the prevention of cognitive decline and evaluate the response of biomarkers to treatment, thereby shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of the link between Kundalini Yoga and cognitive impairment. For the study, 81 participants aged 55 and older who had subjective memory complaints and met criteria for mild cognitive impairment, indicated by a total score of 0.5 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. The results showed that at 12 weeks, both the yoga group showed significant improvements in recall memory and visual memory and showed significant sustained improvement in memory up to the 24-week follow-up, the yoga group showed significant improvement in verbal fluency and sustained significant improvements in executive functioning at week 24. In addition, the yoga cohort showed significant improvement in depressive symptoms, apathy, and resilience from emotional stress. This research was provided by Helen Lavretsky, M.D. and colleagues. In another study, Kundalini Yoga did not show significant effectiveness in treating obsessive-compulsive disorders compared with Relaxation/Meditation. Transcendental Meditation The first Transcendental Meditation (TM) research studies were conducted at UCLA and Harvard University and published in Science and the American Journal of Physiology in 1970 and 1971.Lyn Freeman, Mosby’s Complementary & Alternative Medicine: A Research-Based Approach, Mosby Elsevier, 2009, p. 163 However, much research has been of poor quality, (References the same 2004 systematic review by Canter and Ernst on TM and hypertension that is separately referenced in this article) including a high risk for bias due to the connection of researchers to the TM organization and the selection of subjects with a favorable opinion of TM. Independent systematic reviews have not found health benefits for TM exceeding those of relaxation and health education. A 2013 statement from the American Heart Association described the evidence supporting TM as a treatment for hypertension as Level IIB, meaning that TM \\"may be considered in clinical practice\\" but that its effectiveness is \\"unknown/unclear/uncertain or not well-established\\". In another study, TM proved comparable with other kinds of relaxation therapies in reducing anxiety. Practitioners of TM have demonstrated a one Hertz reduction in EEG alpha wave frequency relative to controls. Research on unspecified or multiple types of meditation=Brain activity The medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices have been found to be relatively deactivated during meditation (experienced meditators using concentration, lovingkindness and choiceless awareness meditation). In addition experienced meditators were found to have stronger coupling between the posterior cingulate, dorsal anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices both when meditating and when not meditating. Over time meditation can actually increase the integrity of both gray and white matter. The added amount of gray matter found in the brain stem after meditation improves communication between the cortex and all other areas within the brain. Meditation often stimulates a large network of cortical regions including the frontal and parietal regions, lateral occipital lobe, the insular cortex, thalamic nuclei, basal ganglia, and the cerebellum region in the brain. These parts of the brain are connected with attention and the default network of the brain which is associated to day dreaming. In addition, both meditation and yoga have been found to have impacts on the brain, specifically the caudate. Here, there is greater connectivity to the caudate, as well as the interaction of basal ganglia cortico-thalamic feedback loops within meditation and yoga practice. Further studies need to be conducted to show a stronger relationship between these areas of brain involvement with common results of yoga and meditation, (improved mental health and well-being). One reason that mindfulness-based approaches could have the impact of decreased anxiety is a result of a decrease in activity with the amygdala, the area of the brain that is involved with the \\"fight or flight\\" response. Another reason this treatment assists anxious individuals is its ability to reduce cortisol levels. This occurs as levels of glucocorticoids remain elevated and act as a force of resistance against cortisol. Biological Impact Mindfulness-based stress reduction has been found to interact and regulate physiological factors such immune, metabolic, cardiovascular, and endocrine systems. Changes in the brain and neuroplasticity Meditation has been shown to change grey matter concentrations and the precuneus. An eight-week MBSR course induced changes in gray matter concentrations. Exploratory whole brain analyses identified significant increases in gray matter concentration in the PCC, TPJ, and the cerebellum. These results suggest that participation in MBSR is associated with changes in gray matter concentration in brain regions involved in learning and memory processes, emotion regulation, self-referential processing, and perspective taking. Studies have found that regular meditation practice increases the protein BDNF in the brain and improves cellular health, reduces the rate of aging within cells, and a reduction of grey matter decay in the brain making it possible for higher neuroplasticity over longer periods of time. Meditation has been linked to higher levels of cognitive flexibility and a greater ability to recognize cognitive evaluations and functions. Recent studies suggest that meditation can increase the amount of gray matter in the medulla oblongata located in the brain stem leading to decreased arousal when dealing with unpleasant situations and higher levels of activity in the higher cortical regions of the brain and insula. Meditation has shown to increase activity in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and enhance communication from the anterior cingulate cortex to the rest of the brain resulting in a better ability to evaluate and resolve cognitive tasks. Studies have shown that meditation actually increases the amount of white matter within the parts of the brain that assist in self regulation and behavior.  Attention/Mind wandering  Meditation has been found to decrease mind wandering and allows the brain to fully focus on challenging tasks for longer periods of time without getting distracted. This is due to an increased ability to reduce activity in the default mode network when focusing on a particular task. Non directive forms of meditation where the meditator lets their mind wander freely can actually produce higher levels of activity in the default mode network when compared to a resting state or having the brain in a neutral place. These Non directive forms of meditation allows the meditators to have better control over thoughts during everyday activities or when focusing on specific task due to a reduced frustration at the brains mind wandering process. When given a specific task, meditation can allow quicker response to changing environmental stimuli. Meditation can allow the brain to decrease attention to unwanted responses of irrelevant environmental stimuli and a reduces the Stroop effect. Those who meditate have regularly demonstrated more control on what they focus their attention on while maintaining a mindful awareness on what is around them. Experienced meditators have been shown to have an increased ability when it comes to conflict monitoring and find it easier to switch between competing stimuli. Those who practice meditation experience an increase of attentional resources in the brain and steady meditation practice can lead to the reduction of the attentional blink due to a decreased mental exertion when identifying important stimuli. Perception Studies have shown that meditation has both short-term and long-term effects on various perceptual faculties. In 1984 a study showed that meditators have a significantly lower detection threshold for light stimuli of short duration. In 2000 a study of the perception of visual illusions by zen masters, novice meditators, and non-meditators showed statistically significant effects found for the Poggendorff Illusion but not for the Müller- Lyer Illusion. The zen masters experienced a statistically significant reduction in initial illusion (measured as error in millimeters) and a lower decrement in illusion for subsequent trials. Tloczynski has described the theory of mechanism behind the changes in perception that accompany mindfulness meditation thus: \\"A person who meditates consequently perceives objects more as directly experienced stimuli and less as concepts… With the removal or minimization of cognitive stimuli and generally increasing awareness, meditation can therefore influence both the quality (accuracy) and quantity (detection) of perception.\\" Brown also points to this as a possible explanation of the phenomenon: \\"[the higher rate of detection of single light flashes] involves quieting some of the higher mental processes which normally obstruct the perception of subtle events.\\" In other words, the practice may temporarily or permanently alter some of the top-down processing involved in filtering subtle events usually deemed noise by the perceptual filters.  Memory  Meditation enhances memory capacity specifically in the working memory and increases executive functioning by helping participants better understand what is happening moment for moment. Those who meditate regularly have demonstrated the ability to better process and distinguish important information from the working memory and store it into long-term memory with more accuracy than those who do not practice meditation techniques. Meditation may be able to expand the amount of information that can be held with in working memory and by so doing is able to improve IQ scores and increase individual intelligence. The encoding process for both audio and visual information has been shown to be more accurate and detailed when meditation is used. Though there are limited studies on meditation's effects on long-term memory because of meditations ability to increase attentional awareness episodic long-term memory is believed to be more vivid and accurate for those who meditate regularly. Meditation has also shown to decrease memory complaints from those who suffer with Alzheimers disease which also suggests the benefits meditation could have on episodic long-term memory which is linked to Alzheimers. Calming and relaxation According to an article in Psychological Bulletin, EEG activity slows as a result of meditation. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has written, \\"It is thought that some types of meditation might work by reducing activity in the sympathetic nervous system and increasing activity in the parasympathetic nervous system,\\" or equivalently, that meditation produces a reduction in arousal and increase in relaxation. Herbert Benson, founder of the Mind-Body Medical Institute, which is affiliated with Harvard University and several Boston hospitals, reports that meditation induces a host of biochemical and physical changes in the body collectively referred to as the \\"relaxation response\\". The relaxation response includes changes in metabolism, heart rate, respiration, blood pressure and brain chemistry. Benson and his team have also done clinical studies at Buddhist monasteries in the Himalayan Mountains. Benson wrote The Relaxation Response to document the benefits of meditation, which in 1975 were not yet widely known. Arousing effects Although the most common modern characterization of Buddhist meditation is a 'relaxation' technique, both scientific studies and Buddhist textual sources proves meditation's arousing or wake-promoting effects. Meditations aiming at improving meta-cognitive skills and compassion (e.g. loving-kindness meditation) are associated with physiological arousal, compared to breathing meditation. Theravada (i.e.Vipassana) styles of meditation induce relaxation responses, while Vajrayana styles of meditation induce arousal responses. Short term meditation training enables the voluntary activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) results in epinephrine release. When the SNS is activated, human body is turning into 'fight or flight' mode, whereas the PNS is termed the 'rest and digest' mode. For example, when SNS is activated, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration will be increased, and catecholamines will be produced, while heart rate variability and galvanic skin resistance will be decreased. Therefore, Relaxing meditation seems to correspond to PNS dominance, and arousing meditation seems to correspond to SNS dominance. Slowing aging Aging is a process accompanied by a decrease in brain weight and volume. This phenomenon can be explained by structural changes in the brain, namely, a loss of grey matter. Some studies over the last decade have implicated meditation as a protective factor against normal age-related brain atrophy. The first direct evidence for this link emerged from a study investigating changes in the cortical thickness of meditators. The researchers found that regular meditation practice was able to reduce age-related thinning of the frontal cortex, though these findings were restricted to particular regions of the brain. A similar study looked to further expand on this finding by including a behavioural component. Consistent with the previous study, meditators did not show the expected negative correlation between grey matter volume and age. In addition, the results for meditators on the behavioural test, measuring attentional performance, were comparable across all age groups. This implies that meditation can potentially protect against age-related grey matter loss and age-related cognitive decline. Since then, more research has supported the notion that meditation serves as a neuroprotective factor that slows age- related brain atrophy. Still, all studies have been cross sectional in design. Furthermore, these results merely describe associations and do not make causal inferences. Further work using longitudinal and experimental designs may help solidify the causal link between meditation and grey matter loss. Since few studies have investigated this direct link, however insightful they may be, there is not sufficient evidence for a conclusive answer. Research has also been conducted on the malleable determinants of cellular aging in an effort to understand human longevity. Researchers have stated, \\"We have reviewed data linking stress arousal and oxidative stress to telomere shortness. Meditative practices appear to improve the endocrine balance toward positive arousal (high DHEA, lower cortisol) and decrease oxidative stress. Thus, meditation practices may promote mitotic cell longevity both through decreasing stress hormones and oxidative stress and increasing hormones that may protect the telomere.\\" Happiness and emotional well-being Studies have shown meditators to have higher happiness than control groups, although this may be due to non-specific factors such as meditators having better general self- care. Positive relationships have been found between the volume of gray matter in the right precuneus area of the brain and both meditation and the subject's subjective happiness score. A recent study found that participants who engaged in a body-scan meditation for about 20 minutes self-reported higher levels of happiness and decrease in anxiety compared to participants who just rested during the 20-minute time-span. These results suggest that an increase in awareness of one's body through meditation causes a state of selflessness and a feeling of connectedness. This result then leads to reports of positive emotions. A technique known as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) displays significant benefits for mental health and coping behaviors. Participants who had no prior experience with MBSR reported a significant increase in happiness after 8 weeks of MBSR practice. Focus on the present moment and increased awareness of one's thoughts can help monitor and reduce judgment or negative thoughts, causing a report of higher emotional well- being.

Potential adverse effects and limits of meditation The following is an official statement from the US government-run National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health: > \\"Meditation is considered to be safe for healthy people. There have been > rare reports that meditation could cause or worsen symptoms in people who > have certain psychiatric problems, but this question has not been fully > researched. People with physical limitations may not be able to participate > in certain meditative practices involving physical movement. Individuals > with existing mental or physical health conditions should speak with their > health care providers prior to starting a meditative practice and make their > meditation instructor aware of their condition.\\" Adverse effects have been reported, and may, in some cases, be the result of \\"improper use of meditation\\". The NIH advises prospective meditators to \\"ask about the training and experience of the meditation instructor… [they] are considering.\\" As with any practice, meditation may also be used to avoid facing ongoing problems or emerging crises in the meditator's life. In such situations, it may instead be helpful to apply mindful attitudes acquired in meditation while actively engaging with current problems. According to the NIH, meditation should not be used as a replacement for conventional health care or as a reason to postpone seeing a doctor. Pain Meditation has been show to reduce pain perception. An intervention known as mindfulness- based pain management (MBPM) has been subject to a range of studies demonstrating its effectiveness.

It began 17 October 1985 starring Donnie Macleod, formerly of Na h-Òganaich, whose appearances made him a cult figure. Donnie was primarily the singer across the many series of the programme. The programme featured a presenter who carried the bulk of the programme presentation although Donnie shared some of the role, particularly when telling the time at the end of the programme. Presenters The presenters were: Donnie Macleod, Rhoda Macleod, Cathy Macdonald, John Urquhart, Gaelic singers Mairi Macinnes and Anna Murray also presented the programme. The first series also featured Anne Sinclair as the singer. She didn't wear hats and accompanied herself on the piano. Premise Donnie wore various different silly hats, which were decorated with something relevant to the song and the programme. Donnie was often seen wearing a default seagull hat when the theme didn't lend itself to be illustrated with a hat. Many of the hats were designed and constructed by costume designer Kirsty Colam. The programme featured 6 puppets. Nelson and Napoleon are a pair of parrots who squawk their way through the 'what's the time' sequence at the end. Cagnaidh the dog and Crotal the rabbit were usually involved with the activities at the opening of the programme. Oighrig the hippo and Ealasaid the elephant mainly sat about and listened to stories. The songs were about everyday things that matter to children, while the style and structure of the songs were traditionally Gaelic. The songs were written to a pre-determined theme by a team of scriptwriters with each writer being responsible for a few programmes across the series. Both Donnie and some of the scriptwriters set the lyrics to music. Most of the songs related to Gaelic culture or Scottish rural life. The show's theme tune was previously used for the Intro of The Further Adventures Of Noddy (a series based on Enid Blyton's books of the 'Toyland' series). Influence It could be argued that most young Gaelic speakers today learned much of their early vocabulary from the programme. Many young singers and musicians were influenced by the style of the music to write and play in their own tradition. Dòtaman is referenced in the 2019 song 'Fairytale of Stornoway' by Western isles band Peat and Diesel, featuring Mairead Fay Nicholson. The song is a reworked version of the Pogues classic 'Fairytale of New York' and is making a bid for Christmas Number 1.

History Delaware and Ulster train, circa 1989 The last regularly scheduled passenger train over the former Ulster & Delaware Railroad (U&D;) tracks was operated between Kingston and Oneonta by the New York Central Railroad on March 31, 1954. The tracks were then cut back to Bloomville in 1965 to make way for construction of Interstate 88 near Oneonta, and for lack of freight business west of Bloomville. Ownership of the tracks passed to Penn Central in 1968, and to the government-backed Conrail on April 1, 1976. The last westbound freight train over the mountains was operated by Conrail on September 26, 1976, with the return trip to gather up all remaining freight cars taking place on October 2, 1976. The DURR is a subsidiary of the not-for-profit Catskill Revitalization Corporation, of Stamford, NY, which owns the former U&D; railbed between Highmount, New York and Bloomville, New York: 45 miles. The line was acquired from Penn Central in 1980, for $770,000, following the successful regional advocacy for this by noted transportation attorney Donald L. Pevsner. Funding was provided by the A. Lindsay and Olive B. O'Connor Foundation, of Hobart, NY, which currently has $57 million in assets derived from IBM stock that was sold to Mr. O'Connor directly by Thomas Watson, Sr., IBM's founder, in the 1920s. The Foundation conveyed the 45-mile- long line to the Delaware County Towns through which it passed, and these Towns later conveyed it to the non-profit Catskill Revitalization Corporation. The new tourist railroad started operations in 1983, between Highmount and Arkville, NY, and extended operations later to the Arkville-Roxbury, NY segment. The DURR operates in Delaware County, New York on the former U&D; tracks from Highmount, where it connects with the Catskill Mountain Railroad, to Hubbell Corners, New York. DURR's operations are currently limited to the Arkville-Roxbury segment; the Highmount-Arkville segment was placed back into service on October 3, 2013, and the Roxbury-Hubbell Corners segment remains out of service. The Hubbell Corners-Bloomville segment was abandoned; the railbed was converted for use as the Catskill Scenic Rail Trail. The DURR suffered a major washout at Kelly's Corner on August 28, 2011, as a result of Hurricane Irene. The east branch of the Delaware River undermined approximately a quarter-mile of track along Route 30, and caused minor washouts and scouring at Halcottsville and other locations along the line; service resumed in May 2012. Rip Van Winkle Flyer The pride of the DURR is the Rip Van Winkle Flyer, a five-car Budd streamline train used for charters. The train consists of: * Observation Car: former NYC No. 61, built 1948 * Tavern Lounge: former Minneapolis & St. Louis No. 52, built 1948 * Dining Car: former ACL No. 5936, built 1950 * Vista Dome: former MP 891, built 1948 * Baggage/Generator, former ATSF The regular train is powered by former Delaware & Hudson 5017, an Alco RS-36, and consists of two flat cars and three former Pennsylvania Railroad MP-54 coaches (441, 444 and 447) lettered for NYC. Other locomotives at the DURR consist of: *Alco S-4's #1012 and #5106, *GE 44 tonner #76, *EMD NW2 #116 Currently under consideration for restoration is the \\"Red Heifer\\" a Model 250 Brill Gas-Electric doodlebug, formerly NYC M-405. This piece of equipment was used extensively during the railroad's early days in 1983. The railway also owns two flatcars. The DURR's Roxbury Station is owned by the Ulster & Delaware Railroad Historical Society and is called the Roxbury Depot Museum. Currently, the entire depot is covered by a structure that was put in place while it was used as a lumber and feed dealer. Volunteers are seeking funds for full restoration, as well as seeking to settle remaining issues with the estate of the former owner before work can proceed.

This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction: : ATP + rhodopsin \\\\rightleftharpoons ADP + phospho- rhodopsin Mutations in rhodopsin kinase are associated with a form of night blindness called Oguchi disease.  Function and mechanism of action  Rhodopsin kinase is a member of the family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases, and is officially named G protein-coupled receptor kinase 1, or GRK1. Rhodopsin kinase is found primarily in mammalian retinal rod cells, where it phosphorylates light-activated rhodopsin, a member of the family of G protein- coupled receptors that recognizes light. Phosphorylated, light-activated rhodopsin binds to the protein arrestin to terminate the light-activated signaling cascade. The related GRK7, also known as cone opsin kinase, serves a similar function in retinal cone cells subserving high-acuity color vision in the fovea. The post-translational modification of GRK1 by farnesylation and α-carboxyl methylation is important for regulating the ability of the enzyme to recognize rhodopsin in rod outer segment disk membranes. Arrestin-1 bound to rhodopsin prevents rhodopsin activation of the transducin protein to turn off photo-transduction completely. Rhodopsin kinase is inhibited by the calcium-binding protein recoverin in a graded manner that maintains rhodopsin sensitivity to light despite large changes in ambient light conditions. That is, in retinas exposed to only dim light, calcium levels are high in retinal rod cells and recoverin is bound to and inhibits rhodopsin kinase, leaving rhodopsin exquisitely sensitive to photons to mediate low-light, low-accuity vision; in bright light, rod cell calcium levels are low so recoverin cannot bind or inhibit rhodopsin kinase, resulting in greater rhodopsin kinase/arrestin inhibition of rhodopsin signaling at baseline to preserve visual sensitivity. According to a proposed model, the N-terminus of rhodopsin kinase is involved in its own activation. It’s suggested that an activated rhodopsin binds to the N-terminus, which is also involved in the stabilization of the kinase domain to induce an active conformation.Orban, Tivadar, et al. “Substrate-Induced Changes in the Dynamics of Rhodopsin Kinase (G Protein- Coupled Receptor Kinase 1).” Biochemistry, vol. 51, no. 16, 2012, pp. 3404–3411.  Eye disease  Mutation in rhodopsin kinase can result in diseases such as Oguchi disease and retinal degeneration. Oguchi disease is a form of congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB). Congenital stationary night blindness is caused by the inability to send a signal from outer retina to the inner retina by signaling molecules. Oguchi disease is a genetic disorder so an individual can be inherited from his or her parents. Genes that are responsible for Oguchi disease are SAG and GRK1 genes. Rhodopsin kinase is encoded from the GRK1 gene, so a mutation in GRK1 can result in Oguchi disease. Retinal degeneration is a form of the retinal disease caused by the death of photoreceptor cells that present in the back of the eye, retina. Rhodopsin kinase directly participates in the rhodopsin to activate the visual phototransduction. Studies have shown that lack of rhodopsin kinase will result in photoreceptor cell death. When photoreceptors cells die, they will be detached from the retina and result in retinal degeneration.

In high-speed flight, the assumptions of incompressibility of the air used in low-speed aerodynamics no longer apply. In subsonic aerodynamics, the theory of lift is based upon the forces generated on a body and a moving gas (air) in which it is immersed. At airspeeds below about , air can be considered incompressible in regards to an aircraft, in that, at a fixed altitude, its density remains nearly constant while its pressure varies. Under this assumption, air acts the same as water and is classified as a fluid. Subsonic aerodynamic theory also assumes the effects of viscosity (the property of a fluid that tends to prevent motion of one part of the fluid with respect to another) are negligible, and classifies air as an ideal fluid, conforming to the principles of ideal-fluid aerodynamics such as continuity, Bernoulli's principle, and circulation. In reality, air is compressible and viscous. While the effects of these properties are negligible at low speeds, compressibility effects in particular become increasingly important as airspeed increases. Compressibility (and to a lesser extent viscosity) is of paramount importance at speeds approaching the speed of sound. In these transonic speed ranges, compressibility causes a change in the density of the air around an airplane. During flight, a wing produces lift by accelerating the airflow over the upper surface. This accelerated air can, and does, reach supersonic speeds, even though the airplane itself may be flying at a subsonic airspeed (Mach number < 1.0). At some extreme angles of attack, in some airplanes, the speed of the air over the top surface of the wing may be double the airplane's airspeed. It is, therefore, entirely possible to have both supersonic and subsonic airflows on an airplane at the same time. When flow velocities reach sonic speeds at some locations on an airplane (such as the area of maximum camber on the wing), further acceleration will result in the onset of compressibility effects such as shock wave formation, drag increase, buffeting, stability, and control difficulties. Subsonic flow principles are invalid at all speeds above this point.

Development The Dragonfly shares a clear family resemblance with the Dragon Rapide, but is smaller and has higher aspect ratio, slightly sweptback wings. The lower wing has a shorter span than the upper, unlike the DH.89, and the top of the engine nacelles protrude much less above its surface because the fuel tank had been moved to the lower centre section. Structurally, too they are different: the Dragonfly had a new preformed plywood monocoque shell and strengthened fuselage. It was designed as a luxury touring aircraft for four passengers and a pilot, with provision for dual controls. The first aircraft, G-ADNA, first flew on 12 August 1935. The Dragonfly achieved maximum performance on low power, by using the new construction methods developed for the de Havilland Comet racer, and therefore was expensive to buy (£2,650). In modern terms, it was an executive transport, aimed at wealthy private individuals, often via the companies they owned. Operational history The first delivery was made in May 1936. Some 36 new- build Dragonflies went to private and company owners, about 15 to airlines/air taxis and three to clubs. Two each went to the Danish and Swedish air forces, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had four to combat rum-runners. Production ended in 1938.Jackson (1978), pp. 374–9Hayes, pp. 145–50 By 1939, several aircraft had moved from private to commercial use, like the fleet built up by Air Dispatch Ltd at Croydon Airport, headed by The Hon Mrs Victor Bruce. Amongst her seven examples were also some ex-airline machines.Hayes p.158 They were used as air taxis between the various London airports, and also as Army Cooperation night flying trainers. Western Airways of Weston- super-Mare Airport used its Dragonfly on a scheduled service via Birmingham to Manchester. Seven airframes were shipped to Canada, and erected by de Havilland Canada, where they served a variety of small commercial operators, the R.C.M.P. and two with the R.C.A.F. At least one, CF-BFF, was fitted with Edo floats, and used commercially. In about 1937, three Dragonflies were bought by the Romanian government for crew training, appearing on their civil register.Grey, C.G. and Bridgman, L., Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1938.(1972). p. 51b. Newton Abott: David & Charles At the start of World War II, about 23 Dragonflies were impressed into the R.A.F and Commonwealth air forces, some six surviving to 1945. Overall, there were about thirteen flying in that year. Dragonfly used by Silver City Airways as an executive transport in 1953 Silver City Airways operated a Dragonfly G-AEWZ as an executive transport from 1950 until 1960. By around 1970, only the two survivors noted below were active. In May 2018 Hertfordshire-based Uno bus named a new fleet of buses after the Dragonfly plane https://www.route- one.net/news/uno_s__1m_investment_for__really_important_route_/ The fuel tanks in the Dragonfly are in the thickened lower centre-section, not immediately behind the engines as in the Dragon Rapide. As a result, only one aircraft was lost to fire. A common cause of loss was the frequent development of a vicious ground loop either on takeoff or landing, resulting in undercarriage writeoff and spar damage.

This investigation leads deep into the history of a war between human civilization and a neighboring alien civilization and challenges the foundation mythos of the current human government. The book is the first in the Alex Benedict series. It is the only one told from Benedict’s point of view; the others are narrated by his pilot and assistant, Chase Kolpath. Plot=Setting and background The story is set approximately 9,600 years in the future (approximately 11,600 C.E.). As is made clearer in McDevitt's later Alex Benedict novel Seeker,Jack McDevitt, Seeker, Ace Books (2005) during the course of recorded history, human civilization has spread through a substantial part of the Orion Arm of our galaxy. The novel is concerned with two time periods – the present of the principal viewpoint character, Alex Benedict, and a period approximately 200 years before his time, which is viewed through back-story. Humanity discovered the ruins of one alien technological civilization, and encountered one that at the time of the story is alive and thriving, the Ashiyyur. The sphere of Ashiyyur worlds is described by the author as abutting the worlds of human civilization along the Perimeter – first contact was made at least several hundred years before the time in which the back-story is set. McDevitt conceives the Ashiyyur as being at approximately the same technological level as humans, and in fact humanoid – bi-laterally symmetrical, bipedal, larger than average for human, of two genders, descended from predators, and interested in the same kind of real estate as humans. Most significantly for the story, they are also incapable of audible speech without mechanical aids, and are nicknamed “Mutes” by humans as a result. The Ashiyyur are telepathic\\"ESP,\\" John Clute and Peter Nichols, The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, St. Martin's Press (1993) and have evolved a society based on that form of communication. They have the ability, with some difficulty, to “read” human minds and emotions. Ashiyyur civilization is described as being much older than human civilization (approximately 75,000 years versus perhaps 15,000) but as having developed much more slowly. It is important to the back-story that to the Ashiyyur, human dynamism and exuberance appear threatening and humans are aggressive, untrustworthy, and unethical. McDevitt describes human civilization at the time of the back-story as spread across many worlds, most of which were independent of the others. All maintained sentimental ties with Earth, but difficulties of interstellar travel and local parochialism ensured that there was no central government. Many human worlds maintained their own armed forces but again there was no central direction. Communication between worlds was limited to travel by interstellar ships, which used magnetic drives for short and medium distance travel within star systems and Armstrong interstellar drives by means of which ships could travel between star systems through “Armstrong space”. Both at the time of the back-story and in the protagonist's time, navigation using Armstrong drives is sufficiently imprecise that ships must for safety reasons emerge from Armstrong space well away from stars and planets and travel substantial distances (and times) using magnetic drives. In addition, and partly as a result, travel through Armstrong space is time-consuming – as described in the novel, a voyage of 3,000 light years takes about seven months, of which about five months time is spent in Armstrong space. It is important to the story that some individuals, like Alex Benedict and most Ashiyyur, react physically badly to the transitions into and out of Armstrong space. As described in the back-story, following first contact with the Ashiyyur, there was increasing friction between human and Ashiyyur civilizations, evolving from a “cold war” into an increasing number of small and then larger military clashes in which the Ashiyyur generally prevailed. The fiercely independent governments of the human worlds responded to the Ashiyyurian challenge largely by dithering and self-deception about the threat. A few human worlds, led by Dellaconda, reacted militarily by forming a small military force, based at first mainly on the Dellacondan navy, to wage a guerrilla war known as \\"the Resistance\\" against the Ashiyyur. The back-story begins at this point in history, although it is not told in strictly chronological sequence. Plot Alex Benedict receives word from a cousin that his uncle Gabriel was among the passengers on an interstellar that disappeared in Armstrong space. A package arrives from his uncle’s lawyers informing Alex that he is his uncle’s heir and giving Alex a sealed message from his uncle. Alex learns that his uncle had been working on a special archeological project that Alex is to pursue now that his uncle cannot. Alex must return to his uncle's home on Rimway and look in the “Leisha Tanner” file to recover relevant research and notes. The message does not discuss the nature of the project, other than to mention Hugh Scott, an old acquaintance. However, en route to Rimway, Alex learns that his uncle’s house has been burgled and, when he arrives, that the Tanner file is missing and all of his uncle's computerized records have been destroyed. From this point onward, the story follows two increasingly intertwined threads, a mystery in the present and a history narrated in the backstory. The mystery is the nature of Uncle Gabe’s project, which Alex works to discover. As Alex does so, he becomes increasingly immersed in the history of the Resistance and its principal leader and hero, Christopher Sim. The story switches back and forth between the developing mystery and the historical narrative. Alex visits the local police inspector and learns that the burglars apparently wanted only the Tanner file. The inspector, a social friend of Alex's uncle, can shed little light on Gabe’s project other than to note that Alex's uncle seemed distracted for the three months before his death and that he had become a “nut” on the subject of Christopher Sim and the Resistance. Chase Kolpath visits Alex at his uncle's house. Before disappearing, Gabriel Benedict had hired Ms. Kolpath to investigate the last flight of the Tenandrome, Hugh Scott's Planetary Survey ship, and then meet Gabe at a world near the Veiled Lady star cluster and pilot them to an unspecified destination. Alex's uncle disappeared before reaching his destination, and owed Ms. Kolpath a considerable sum. Alex agrees to pay what his uncle owed her and asks her to assist him in his investigations. From the planned logistics of the trip, Ms. Kolpath estimates that they were to travel from 800 to 1,500 light years distance. Chase doesn’t know Gabe’s objective, only that it had something to do with the Tenandrome. That ship had explored the Veiled Lady about three years before Gabe’s death and returned unexpectedly early. “Apparently, they saw something. . . Gabe wanted to know what, but I could never find out.” Alex researches the Tenandrome flight but finds no indication of anything unusual besides a mechanical breakdown. He then attempts to visit Hugh Scott, but finds that Scott has been away from home for months. One of his neighbors notes that Scott’s personality has changed since the Tenandrome flight. Like Alex's uncle, Scott has become obsessed by the Resistance and Christopher Sim. Alex gradually learns more of the history of the Resistance and is puzzled by the fact that during the war Sim’s forces, and especially Sim himself, appear to have been present and in action at widely separated locations virtually simultaneously. He contacts the local Ashiyyur representative office to review Ashiyyur records of the war, which might shed some light on the problem. Alex meets S’Kalian and experiences mind-to-mind contact for the first time. He learns that the Ashiyyur are aware of the “problem” of Sim’s nearly simultaneous appearances in distant places and account for it as human scholars have done, by assuming that Sim’s fleet included as many as three other Dellacondan vessels disguised as the Corsarius, Sim's ship, as a form of psychological warfare. Dellaconda itself is the next destination, as Chase and Alex continue their hunt for Hugh Scott. Alex visits Christopher Sim’s home and the school where he taught before the war; both are maintained as shrines to his memory. He locates and meets with Hugh Scott, in spite of Scott’s obvious reluctance. Scott will not say anything about theTenandrome mission, except to confirm that the survey ship found something and that there was a good reason to keep it secret. Alex startles Scott by guessing that the Tenadrome had found a Dellacondan warship, but Scott will say no more. The mystery begins to unravel. Alex and Chase decide that whatever the Tenandrome found, Lesha Tanner had found it first, 200 years before. Alex has an inspiration – the location of the missing something is obliquely described in a poem by Walford Candles, to whom Tanner must have confided the secret. A collection of Candles' poems, Rumors of Earth, had been in Uncle Gabe’s bedroom when Alex returned, and was open to that poem. Gabriel Benedict must have had the same insight. Alex is able to find the university researcher who helped his uncle work with the clues in Candles’ poem and who identifies a location about 1,300 light years into the Veiled Lady as the primary locus of search. Alex and Chase rent a ship and begin a two-month journey through Armstrong space. At their destination, they find a red dwarf star with two planets in its habitable zone. One appears to be a terrestrial world and they move toward it. From a distance, they are able to see something artificial orbiting this world. Moving closer, they can see first that it is a ship, then that it is a warship, and then that it is a Dellacondan warship. Finally, they can make out clearly the ship’s insignia – the famous markings of Corsarius, Christoper Sim’s own. They board the ship and find that the Corsarius has power and appears functional. Indeed, the ship appears virtually normal, aside from a few mechanical malfunctions due to age. They play back the captain’s log, and unexpectedly find that it ends before the battle at Rigel at which Sim died. They listen to the whole record and hear a Sim’s-eye view of the history of the Resistance. It becomes clear that as time had passed, Sim became increasingly angry at the shortsightedness of the major human worlds and increasingly disturbed by the casualties among “our finest and bravest.” Toward the end, “his anger flared: there will be a Confederacy one day, . . . but they will not construct it on the bodies of my men.” Gradually, Alex works out the answer. Christopher Sim became disillusioned with the war and wanted to sue for peace. His brother Tarien and other Resistance leaders seized him and marooned him on this planet to keep him from surrendering. Alex confirms this by searching the planet in a lander and finding Sim’s camp. There is no indication there what happened to Sim. Chase reports from orbit that an Ashiyyur warship is inbound at high speed. Then another appears, slowing to make orbit around Sim's world of exile. Alex warns Chase to abandon their rented ship for the Corsarius; she does so just before the first Ashiyyur warship destroys their rented ship. Alex joins her and learns that the Armstrong drive on the Corsarius won’t be fully charged for about a day. Their problem is to stay alive until the Armstrong drive is ready. They borrow a classic maneuver from one of Sim’s battles and leave orbit at high speed headed directly toward the incoming Ashiyyur warship, which cannot slow its speed quickly enough to meet them. It uses lasers to disable Corsarius' magnetic drives; Chase realizes too late that she has forgotten to raise the ship’s shields. The Ashiyyur warship reverses its trajectory and reaches them about ten hours before they can jump. It demands their surrender. Through a strategem, Alex and Chase are able to fire Corsarius’ major weapons at it, damaging it badly and forcing it to flee. Ten hours later, the interstellar drive activates. It is not an Armstrong drive but something else, product of Rashim Machesney’s genius. In an eye blink, Corsarius is in orbit around Rimway, and safe. The huge (if temporary) technological advantage conferred on humanity by the new drive ends the human-Ashiyyur rivalry; the Perimeter stabilizes and more peaceful relations develop between the two civilizations. In an epilogue to the novel, the reader learns, with Hugh Scott, that Christopher Sim did not die on the planet where he was marooned. Sim was rescued by Leisha Tanner and lived afterward under the assumed identity of Jerome Courtney, spending considerable time as a respected lay brother at a Catholic monastery on an isolated planet. There, he continued to write on various historical and philosophical subjects. Principal characters=The Present The following are the principal characters from the story set in the \\"present\\" of the novel: Alex Benedict - A reputable and very successful dealer in human antiquities. His interest in the field was sparked by his uncle, Gabriel Benedict, who raised him from an early age. Gabriel Benedict - An older man of independent means, an amateur archeologist, well-regarded and greatly experienced in the field. He lived on Rimway, in the country west of Andiquar, the planetary capital and capital of the Confederacy. Chase Kolpath - When the story opens, Ms. Kolpath is an experienced private interstellar pilot who had been working with Gabriel Benedict intermittently for several years. S’Kalian - Representative of the Ashiyyur on Rimway. Hugh Scott - Formerly an acquaintance of Gabriel Benedict, later a member of the Planetary Survey and a crew member on the Tenandrome on its flight to explore the Veiled Lady star cluster. The Past The following are all historical characters who play significant roles in the back-story. Christopher Sim - Christopher Sim is the most important character in the \\"historical\\" back-story, the person around whom the central mystery of the novel revolves. As Alex Benedict's quest progresses, the author reveals more and more of Sim's story. Sim lived about 200 years before the novel's \\"present\\" time, beginning as a teacher of Ancient History and Government on the planet Dellaconda, a frontier world near the Perimeter (border) with Ashiyyur space. McDevitt portrays the reaction of Sim, his politician brother Tarien Sim and others on Dellaconda and neighboring frontier worlds to the Ashiyyur threat: they banded together, formed a small naval force and conducted a guerrilla war (the \\"Resistance\\") over a four or five year period against the Ashiyyur. The author tells (one of his major themes) how the Resistance faced apathy or outright hostility from most other humans - for every human world that supported the Resistance, McDevitt tells us, two remained neutral (including the most powerful) and a few accepted overlordship of the Ashiyyur. McDevitt portrays Christopher Sim as an unlikely hero who rose to greatness through an unexpected \\"talent for war,\\" a charismatic military genius able to anticipate his enemy’s plans and outwit them with his own. As McDevitt describes the history of the war, over several years, Sim's forces won a series of improbable military victories against far superior Ashiyyur forces through a combination of audacity, imaginative tactics, excellent strategic intelligence, and uncanny insights into Ashiyyur psychology. Sim’s forces, small though they were (“sixty-odd frigates and destroyers holding off the massive fleets of the Ashiyyur”), seemed to be everywhere at once. McDevitt tells us that Sim's strategic successes foreshadowed his ultimate tactical defeat. While the tide of public opinion (if not government policies) on human worlds slowly turned in favor of the Resistance, Sim’s forces’ unavoidable losses in battle and meager replenishment and the much larger military forces on the other side eventually brought Sim to bay. In a climactic battle near Rigel, Sim’s remaining forces were overwhelmed and his famous ship, the frigate Corsarius, was destroyed. Only a handful of Dellacondan ships survived the battle; the Resistance navy ceased to exist for all practical purposes. Christopher Sim’s death in battle, like that of Leonidas at Thermopylae, changed everything, according to the author. Public opinion swung swiftly to demand war against the Ashiyyur. Previously hesitant governments on many worlds now committed to the war effort; one especially resistant government was overthrown by an enraged populace and its major military forces committed to the war. Within a few months, Tarien Sim and his colleagues were able to persuade the majority of human worlds to sign the Instrument of Confederation creating a human federal government. The military forces of \\"half a hundred human worlds\\" were contributed to a unified Confederate fleet, which battled the Ashyyur forces to a standstill and preserved the independence of human civilization. Tarien Sim did not live to see this outcome; he was killed in battle shortly before the Instrument was signed and before the weight of human forces could be effectively mobilized. Leisha Tanner - Another key figure, through whose perceptions (reflected in her private papers and the journals of her friend Walford Candles) McDevitt tells the major part of the back-story. She was a university professor at and after the time of the Resistance, a specialist in Ashiyyur philosophy and literature. Her translations of and writings on the most important Ashiyyur philosopher, Tulisofala, are still considered definitive in Alec Benedict’s time. She was a peace activist during the early years of the Resistance, later becoming a staff intelligence officer and diplomat for the Dellacondans. Rashim Machesney - The most eminent physicist at the time of the Resistance, an expert in gravitational wave theory. Portrayed by the author as a larger-than-life Falstaffian figure, Machesney declared support for the Resistance early in the war and joined them with much of his scientific team. The Ashiyyur denounced him as a war criminal for creating advanced weaponry for Sim’s military forces. His principal apparent value to the Resistance was diplomatic. Together with Tarien Sim, Machesney was the public face of the Resistance. His scientific prestige lent credibility to the cause, his political campaigns drew public attention, his brilliant writings persuaded. Walford Candles - A professor of classical literature, a war poet, a contemporary of Christopher Sim and a friend of Leisha Tanner. In the novel, his journals are the best source of information about and insight into Leisha Tanner. They also paint a vivid picture of life on the home front during the time of the Resistance, with non-combatants waiting in hope and despair as the fortunes of the Dellacondans rise and, eventually, fall.  Critical reception  The SF Site's Steven H Silver wrote, \\"While A Talent for War is not McDevitt's best novel, it shows signs of the writer he is still becoming. Even where the characters flag, the ideas remain at the forefront and manage to place A Talent for War above a standard space opera or science fictional mystery.\\" Reviewer Russ Allbery praised the novel's \\"unique perspective\\" on the theme of first contact with aliens, its \\"quaint feel that's both comfortable and oddly prosaic,\\" and its \\"satisfying, tense conclusion\\": Science fiction scholar John Clute, comparing McDevitt's second novel with his first, The Hercules Text, wrote, \\"A Talent for War (1988 [sic]), set in a galactic venue eons hence, similarly sets a religious frame around the central quest plot, in which a young man must thread his way through the unsettled hinterlands dividing human and alien space in his search for the secret that may retroactively destroy the reputation of a human who has been a hero in the recent wars. In both novels, [McDevitt] wrestles valiantly with the task he has set himself: that of imposing an essentially contemplative structure upon conventions designed for violent action. He comes, at times, close to success.\\" A Talent for War is not one of the three novels annotated under Jack McDevitt's name in the current (fifth) edition of Anatomy of Wonder.Anatomy of Wonder, Entry II-737-739, pp. 298-299.

It also featured underground rap and hardcore artists. It was first set up in November 2002 by two South London-based businessmen on a marketing budget of £2,500, with no previous TV experience. The channel continued into 2003 when it was cancelled. Audience The channel provided an alternative to the other rock-orientated music video channels around at the time. P-Rock played videos almost constantly, in contrast to channels such as MTV2 which often features interview segments in the form of talk shows and other such programming. Also, P-Rock provided an alternative to the other channels of similar nature, in the manner of the type of music that was played. The channel played lesser-known underground bands, as well as more popular acts. Also, there was much more focus on contemporary and classic punk rock than the metal and rock that Kerrang! featured heavily in its programming. Playlist The channel's popularity relied partially upon the inclusion of popular artists among its track list. However, the playlist also featured a number of bands that rarely, if ever, had any time devoted to them on other channels, such as Farse. It mainly played US bands, but also included some UK bands, particularly more underground acts. Over the Christmas 2002 period, the channel notably played videos by Rancid, Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards, The Distillers, The Vandals, The Offspring, Tsunami Bomb, Jimmy Eat World and Reel Big Fish, as well as a number of artists on Drive Thru Records such as Allister and Homegrown. They later extended to underground rap-rock bands such as Cypress Hill and N.E.R.D. The channel also branched out and introduced less well known bands such as Good Riddance, Bouncing Souls, No Use for a Name and King Prawn. Programming The channel managed a near non- stop stream of viewer-selected videos filled on the schedule, while there were features such as the Top 10 at weekends, or late at night. The channel also allowed itself to show some of the less savoury music videos at night that were banned from daytime showing, such as the gory video to the Misfits song \\"Scream\\". Complaints Technical problems were rife during the channel's run, some of which being satellite failure and glitches in the videos. Cancellation P-Rock's co-founder and financial backer Mark Shipman, has stated that lack of commitment by advertisers led to the decision to close the channel down, when in fact the channel was cartelled by both Viacom and E-map who, at the time, were the owners of all the other music channels on the Sky platform. Although it was receiving over 600,000 viewers a week around the time of closure, the reluctance of advertisers to risk losing spots on the other music channels meant p-rock.tv without adverts was no longer financially secure. After its original cancellation, the channel resumed playing in May 2003 for a brief while but was later cancelled a second time. Before its final cancellation, the channel was put on a permanent technical failure notice, before being closed down for the final time.

As a bandleader, Jones has released seven albums under the Mack Avenue Records label. He performs with his own groups both nationally and internationally. Jones often plays at music venues and jazz festivals such as the Monterey Jazz Festival, Detroit International Jazz Festival, the Vail Jazz Festival and Montreal International Jazz Festival.  Background  Among Jones' first musical experiences were the gospel music he heard while attending Saint James' Church of God in Christ in Warren, Ohio, where he sang and performed with the choir. As a beginning musician, Jones started on the drums and switched to trumpet in the fifth grade after his grandmother told him about his grandfather playing the instrument during World War II. Jones developed an interest in jazz music around the same time, after receiving two Miles Davis albums from his band instructor, namely Kind of Blue and Tutu. By the time he entered Warren G. Harding High School, Jones had decided to pursue a career as a professional musician, and studied classical trumpet as well as jazz. In 2000, Jones obtained an undergraduate degree in classical trumpet performance from Youngstown State University and later a master's degree from Rutgers University, where he studied under Professor William Fielder, who had also taught Wynton Marsalis, among others. As a session musician, Jones has performed with several notable ensembles and musicians, including Tia Fuller, Gerald Wilson, Joe Lovano, Tom Harrell, Jon Faddis, Jimmy Heath and Frank Foster. In 2004, Jones had a six-month stint with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, after which Marsalis offered him a position with the ensemble as a third trumpeter then moved to the lead chair a couple months later. Around the same time, Jones became a music professor at Duquesne University, and lived in the Pittsburgh area for several years. Jones has recently been selected as the Interim Artistic Director for the Cleveland Jazz Orchestra. He became an associate professor of Jazz Trumpet at Oberlin Conservatory for the 2012-2013 academic year. He was a member of the SFJAZZ Collective from 2015 - 2017. He previously served as head of the Brass Department at Berklee College of Music. He currently serves as the chair of the jazz studies department of the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD.

The village was the site of several important events in the history of Bohemia, and is situated in the west of the Czech Republic under the statutes of Žihle municipality. History Kalec's origins begin in the 13th century, it was a modest establishment with a bunker, inhabited by families of the low nobility formed during the middle age. Kalecs steps to be a part of the Monastery of Plasy caused disputes between several feudal entities until 1346. In the 14th century the monastery began to acquire properties in this establishment. During the period of the Battle of White Mountain in the 30 Years War against Sweden, Kalec was occupied several times, including by Emperor Frediand II. Evzen Tyttl, in 1710–16, allowed the construction of a mansion in the \\"baroco\\" style. A small chapel was built for \\"Holy Daisy\\", after much negligence, Abbot Fortunato Hartmann rebuilt and designed the chapel after the Czech Italian architect Jan Santini Aichel's influence. The Inn at Kalec underwent a total rehabilitation and modernization in 1769. In 1785, Kalec, after the approval from the Church, went to the dominions of \\"Manetin\\" and for the beginning of the 19th century it became part of Rabstejn. However, in 1787, the property was acquired by the Lazanský family. Kalec had great relevance during the Second World War due to its location, which is at a crucial part of the Edge of Sudetes Mountain or Sudetenland. The Sudetenland, along with the Sudetes Mountain was first taken by Hitler, after the war it restored by the Decrees of Edvard Beneš. With the formation of the Czechoslovakia state in 1918, the property was expropriated, and put under an agrarian reform which was put into the hands of a cooperative. In 1934, the property was acquired by Jaroslav Brček an industrialist from Plzeň. The precise location of the buildings in rhombus, plus the complexity of the wooden structures and the vaulted buildings, constituted substantial reason for the admiration and studying of the students at the time. The most important structure is largely regarded as the castle, which is characterized as having five floors with leaned wings. In 1973, Dvůr Kalec had been declared a National Heritage. At the moment Kalec is having repairs done to the facade. The property is made up on a total of of earth, between fields of culture, meadows, lakes and forests.

It is an addictive opiate, used recreationally as a psychoactive drug. Poppy straw, like opium, is harvested from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). Polish heroin was used mainly in Central and Eastern Europe prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of communist control of the countries of the Warsaw Pact or Eastern Bloc. While related to opium, Polish heroin more nearly resembles poppy tea in its impurity, but can be very potent. This drug was also considered by Eastern Bloc addicts to be one of last resort when refined heroin, morphine, or other similar drugs were unavailable, as was often the case during the 1950s through the end of the Soviet era. Illicit drug trafficking and clandestine drug manufacture within the communist-governed nations of Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Russia itself, and others was on a much smaller scale and the supply far more erratic and unreliable compared to that of Western nations. Opium poppies, by contrast, were widely available and relatively inexpensive. The drug has been known as early as the 1940s. The drug in its finished state is a bitter brown fluid looking like tea or cola in color. Polish heroin contains diacetylmorphine (heroin), 6-monoacetylmorphine (active metabolite of heroin), 3-monoacetylmorphine (less-active metabolite of heroin), morphine and small amounts of codeine. The amount of opiates can be high provided that the end product is not overly diluted during production, but the amount of diacetylmorphine and 6-monoacetylmorphine created depends on the skills of people making it and the time and conditions of acetylation. The use of the term kompot or compote refers euphemistically to kompot, a traditional compote-like dessert popular in Central and Eastern European countries made of stewed fruit, spices, and sugar. The so-called kompot method of making a crude opiate \\"cocktail\\" intended for injection involves stewing the pods of the opium poppy in nearly boiling water and an acid, and using the strained liquid (essentially like kompot is produced from the raw ingredients). However, in 1976 two Polish students from Gdańsk discovered a simple way of making it by extracting opiate alkaloids from poppy straw by using ion exchange resin, acetone, ammonia water and a few other chemicals used in the last step of production. In this method, opium poppy pods and stems are boiled in water for a few hours without adding acid, and then filtered. Strongly acidic ion exchange resin is then added. The resin is filtered and the opiates are recovered with the addition of ammonia water. The resulting liquid is evaporated using a chemical condenser, then when dry (it is then called glazura - glaze) it is acetylated using acetic anhydride in an anhydrous environment of a non-polar solvent, for example toluene, diethyl ether, chloroform, or most commonly acetone. After acetylation, the solvent is evaporated to remove the acetic anhydride, and finally water is added. The amount of water added depends on the amount of plant material used in the beginning of the process, most often 30 milliliters per kilogram of dry plant material. Although the drug is primarily intended for intravenous injection, kompot extraction as described here produces an end product containing residual plant matter, waste chemicals, impure water, and other contaminants, making this dangerous substance to inject since such impurities can lead to abscesses or anaphylactic shock. The Power of the Poppy: Harnessing Nature’s Most Dangerous Plant Ally, By Kenaz Filan. Page 96. Inner Traditions / Bear & Co, Feb 23, 2011. Accessed via Google Books July 28, 2016 Polish heroin has been in declining use since the break-up of the Soviet Union and its Central and Eastern European satellite states (Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, et al.) as after 1991 the availability of heroin and other drugs smuggled into those countries from abroad increased enormously. Since then, \\"kompot\\"/\\"Polish heroin\\" has all but disappeared, except in a few rural areas where cheaper, purer, more potent drugs have not overwhelmed the illicit marketplace.

The original go-go boots, as defined by André Courrèges in 1964, were white, low-heeled, and mid-calf in height, a specific style which is sometimes called the Courrèges boot. Since then, the term go-go boot has come to include the knee-high, square-toed boots with block heels that were very popular in the 1960s and 1970s; as well as a number of variations including kitten heeled versions and colours other than white.  Etymology  The term go-go is derived from the French expression à gogo, meaning \\"in abundance, galore\\", which is in turn derived from the ancient French word la gogue for \\"joy, happiness\\".Le Petit Robert: GOGO (À), 1440; de l'a. fr. gogue \\"réjouissance\\" The term \\"go-go\\" has also been explained as a 1964 back-formation of the 1962 slang term \\"go\\", meaning something that was \\"all the rage\\"; the term \\"go-go dancer\\" first appeared in print in 1965. The go-go boot is presumed to have been named after the dance style.  1960s  Fashion boots were revived in the early 1960s by designers such as Beth Levine, although at first they featured fashionable high heels such as the stiletto and kitten heels. The earliest go-go boots were mid-calf, white and flat-heeled, as seen in the work of the designer André Courrèges, who is often credited with creating the style. The simple minimalism of the Courrèges boot was easily and widely reproduced for the mass market. Courrèges boots provided the foundation for the development of the go-go boot, which increasingly came higher up the leg and was made in alternative colours. While remaining low- ish, the heel also became higher and chunkier. The earliest Courrèges boots were made of leather, such as kidskin or patent leather, but many of the subsequent versions and copies were made in PVC, vinyl, and other plastics. Go-go boots as worn in London in 1969/1970 In 1966, the song \\"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\\" was released and performed by a go-go boot wearing Nancy Sinatra, who is credited with further popularising the boot. Tim Gunn suggests that Sinatra helped establish the boot as \\"a symbol of female power\\". Female dancers on the television shows Hullabaloo and Shindig! also wore the short, white boots. This led to the boots sometimes being called 'hullabaloo boots,' as in an advertisement run in American newspapers in January 1966 for hullabaloo boots with \\"kooky heels and zipper backs\\" for the \\"Go-Go Getter\\". Post-1960s Pair of black go-go boots, mid-1990s. In the mid-1990s, as part of a general revival of 1960s fashions, go-go boots came back into style.

Although all German states (including Prussia) had been de facto dissolved since 1933, the Nazi government formally partitioned the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau into two provinces with a decree issued on 1 April 1944 and effective on 1 July 1944. The two new provinces were the province of Kurhessen and the province of Nassau. The name comes from the former Duchy of Nassau (1806–1866), which Prussia annexed following the Austro-Prussian War to form part of the province of Hesse-Nassau. Following the end of World War II, the province of Nassau fell under American administration. The province of Nassau was dissolved by the occupying US forces on 19 September 1945, forming part of the administrative zone of Greater Hesse. Just over a year later, Greater Hesse became the modern German state of Hesse. Small parts of the province of Nassau also became part of Rhineland-Palatinate.

Early life Casanova attended Ponce High School in Puerto Rico. Baseball career=Minor leagues He was drafted 220th overall, in the eighth round of the 1990 draft by the New York Mets. His professional career started off that year. In 65 at bats, he collected only five hits for a .077 batting average. In his 1991 season he had 18 at-bats with the Kingsport Mets, he collected one hit for a .056 batting average. In 32 games with the Gulf Coast League Mets that year, he hit .243. His 1992 season was an improvement; in 137 at-bats with Kingsport that year, not only did he hit his first professional home run, but he also hit .270. He hit only .167 in 18 at bats with the Columbia Mets that year though. After the 1992 season, he was traded with Wally Whitehurst and D. J. Dozier to the San Diego Padres for Tony Fernández. He spent the whole of 1993 with the Waterloo Diamonds, and he hit .256 with six home runs in 76 games. Then, in 1994, he had the best season of his professional career. Playing for the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, his batting average rose to .340, and he also hit 23 home runs and had 120 runs batted in (RBIs). Because of his outstanding performance, he was named the Padres Minor League Player of the Year. He was also a California League All-Star. In 1995, Casanova saw his average drop to .271, but he did hit 12 home runs while with the Memphis Chicks. He was playing in Double-A baseball, higher than he had ever played before. According to Baseball America, he was the 60th best prospect in 1995. After the 1995 season, he was traded with Richie Lewis and Melvin Nieves to the Detroit Tigers for Sean Bergman, Todd Steverson and minor leaguer Cade Gaspar. He started 1996 off strong, hitting .333 in 30 at bats with the Jacksonville Suns. That prompted his promotion to Triple-A, where he hit .273 in 49 games. Major leagues He made his major league debut on May 24 of that year at the age of 23, going 0-for-4 in his debut game. He collected his first hit on May 27 off pitcher Tim Belcher of the Kansas City Royals. Two days later in his very next game, he hit his first career home run, a solo shot off Kevin Appier. Overall, he played 25 games for the Tigers that year, hitting .188 with four home runs and nine RBIs. In 1996, he hit home runs from both sides of the plate in one game. He was the team's main starting catcher in 1997, although Matt Walbeck also got a fairly large amount of playing time. In 101 games with Detroit that year, he hit .243 with five home runs and 24 RBIs. Of all the players on the team who appeared in over 100 games, he was the only one not to collect 40 or more RBIs. He also spent some time in the minors, hitting .195 in 12 games with the Toledo Mud Hens. He started 1998 as the team's starting catcher, but after collecting only two hits in his first 13 games, he was sent down to Toledo. In 50 games with Toledo that year, he hit .257. He was recalled back to the Majors in July of that year, but only played three more games in the big leagues. Overall, he hit only .143 in 16 games with the Tigers that year. He spent all of 1999 in the minor leagues, playing as low as Rookie League baseball. In two games with the GCL Tigers that year, he collected four hits (including a home run) in five at-bats. In 12 at-bats with Single-A Advanced Lakeland, he hit .500, hitting another home run. He really struggled while with Triple-A Toledo-he spent 44 games with them and hit only .206. He was granted free agency after the 1999 season and was signed by the Colorado Rockies. He was released by them before the beginning of the season and was then picked up by the Milwaukee Brewers. Casanova, Henry Blanco and Tyler Houston all spent time catching for the Brewers in 2000. He hit .247 with six home runs (including two grand slams) and 36 RBIs for the Brewers that year. He also hit .288 in 20 games with the Indianapolis Indians that season. He was the team's main backup catcher in 2001, backing up Blanco. He had a career year that year, belting a career high 11 home runs and hitting a career high .260 in 71 games. Also, for the first time in his career, he did not spent any time in the minors that season. 2002 was a bad season for Casanova. He started off with the Brewers, but after hitting only .184 in 31 games with them he was released and quickly signed by the Baltimore Orioles. He only played two games with them that year, collecting no hits in one at bat. Overall, he hit .182 that year, with one home run and eight RBIs. He spent 14 games with Indianapolis that year as well-he hit .279 with them. He played in five different farm systems between 2003 and 2005, playing well. He played for the Colorado Springs Sky Sox and Ottawa Lynx in 2003, hitting .301 while with the Sky Sox, who are in the Colorado Rockies farm system, and .286 with the Lynx, who are in the Orioles farm system. Signed as a free agent by the Boston Red Sox in 2004, he hit .270 in 23 games with their Triple-A team, the Pawtucket Red Sox before being sent to the Kansas City Royals as part of a conditional deal. In 58 games with their Triple-A team, the Omaha Royals, he hit .323 with 10 home runs. Even after a great performance in their system, Casanova was released by the Royals and then signed by the Chicago White Sox. He spent 70 games with their Triple-A team, the Charlotte Knights, before getting called up to the Majors in the latter part of the season. In six games with the White Sox that year, he collected one hit in five at-bats. He was granted free agency after the 2005 season and was signed by the Oakland Athletics. He played in a total of eight minor league games in 2006, hitting .265 in 34 at-bats. He spent time with three teams in 2006 – he played two games with the Stockton Ports, two games with the Midland RockHounds and four games with the Sacramento River Cats. He was a non-roster invitee to spring training in 2007 for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He was assigned to the Triple-A Durham Bulls. In June 2007, Casanova was called up to back up Dioner Navarro in the major leagues. In 29 big league games in 2007, Casanova hit .253 with six home runs and 11 RBIs. His slugging percentage was .519. In 44 games with the Bulls, he hit .291 with five home runs and 21 RBIs. On December 12, 2007, Casanova signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets.

Biography Lowry was born La Guaira, Venezuela, the son of the U.S. Consul Robert K. Lowry. He was appointed a midshipman on January 21, 1840, (or on January 31), and was promoted to passed midshipman on July 11, 1846. He then served in the Mexican War, and later also took part in Commodore Matthew C. Perry's expedition to Japan in the mid-1850s. Lowry was promoted to Master on March 1, 1855, and then to lieutenant on September 14 the same year. At the very start of the Civil War, Lowry was serving aboard the sloop , moored in the Potomac River, off Alexandria, Virginia. Early on May 24, 1861, as a force of federal troops from Washington D.C. approached by land and by gunboat, the captain of Pawnee, Stephen C. Rowan, acting without orders, dispatched Lieutenant Lowry to find the Confederate commander Colonel George H. Terrett and to demand his surrender. Terrett, aware of the hopelessness of his position, promptly ordered his troops to abandon the town, leaving it in Union hands. The only casualty was Elmer E. Ellsworth, Colonel of the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, who after taking down a Confederate flag flying over the Marshall House Inn, was shot by the owner James W. Jackson. Lowry commanded the army transport steamship George Peabody, landing troops during the Battle of Hatteras Inlet Batteries in August 1861. He then commanded the gunboat from October 1861 until February 1862, and as part of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, took part in operations off North Carolina, in November sinking three blockships at the entrance to Ocracoke Inlet, and then in February 1862 capturing enemy fortifications on Roanoke Island, and then taking part in the subsequent capture of Elizabeth City. Lowry then served as the executive officer of the sloop during the capture of New Orleans in April 1862, and during the first attack on Vicksburg in June. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on July 16, 1862. He then commanded the gunboat in extensive river operations. On May 19, 1863 Lowry wrote to the Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles urging that naval officers and seamen not employed at sea be used to man forts and seacoast defenses, stating that: The most successful defenses made against us – at various points of the Mississippi and the seacoast have been made by ex-naval officers and seamen; in the last defense of Port Hudson the guns were worked by seamen and naval men, so at Vicksburg, at Galveston, and Charleston. The defenses of Sebastopol were entirely defended by Russian seamen for many months, while from the fort guarding that port they beat back the combined fleets of England and France. After the war, on July 25, 1866, Lowry was promoted to the rank of commander. On August 27, 1869 Lowry commissioned the wooden screw sloop of war at the New York Navy Yard. In December 1869, Severn was assigned as flagship of the North Atlantic Squadron under Rear Admiral Charles H. Poor. Severn called at Key West in January 1871 before cruising in the West Indies. In April, she investigated alleged mistreatment of the United States consul at Santiago de Cuba, subsequently sailing to Hampton Roads at the end of July. Leaving Hampton Roads in December, Severn sailed to the Boston Navy Yard, decommissioning there on December 31, 1871. Lowry having received another promotion on November 2, 1871, to the rank of captain. Lowry's last command was the New London Naval Station, having been promoted to commodore on April 1, he shortly thereafter died at the Brooklyn Naval Hospital on November 25, 1880. The (DD-770), launched on February 6, 1944, was named in his honor. USS Lowry received four battle stars for World War II service and two for Korean War service, and was deployed during the Vietnam War. She was decommissioned in October 1973 and sold to Brazil.

It is in humans encoded by the ~2.5 kb AANAT gene containing four exons, located on chromosome 17q25. The gene is translated into a 23 kDa large enzyme. It is well conserved through evolution and the human form of the protein is 80% identical to sheep and rat AANAT. It is an acetyl-CoA-dependent enzyme of the GCN5-related family of N-acetyltransferases (GNATs). It may contribute to multifactorial genetic diseases such as altered behavior in sleep/wake cycle and research is on-going with the aim of developing drugs that regulate AANAT function.  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:2-arylethylamine N-acetyltransferase. Other names in common use include: * AANAT * Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase * Melatonin rhythm enzyme * Serotonin acetylase * Serotonin acetyltransferase * Serotonin N-acetyltransferase The officially accepted name is aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase. Function and mechanism=Tissue distribution The AANAT mRNA transcript is mainly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). It is detectable at low levels in several brain regions including the pituitary gland as well as in the retina. It is most highly abundant in the pineal gland which is the site of melatonin synthesis. Brain and pituitary AANAT may be involved in the modulation of serotonin-dependent aspects of human behavior and pituitary function.  Physiological function  In the pinealocyte cells of the pineal gland, aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase is involved in the conversion of serotonin to melatonin. It is the penultimate enzyme in the melatonin synthesis controlling the night/day rhythm in melatonin production in the vertebrate pineal gland. Melatonin is essential for seasonal reproduction, modulates the function of the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and influences activity and sleep. Due to its important role in circadian rhythm, AANAT is subjected to extensive regulation that is responsive to light exposure (see Regulation). It may contribute to multifactorial genetic diseases such as altered behavior in sleep/wake cycle and mood disorders. The chemical reactions catalyzed by AANAT The primary chemical reaction that is catalyzed by aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase uses two substrates, acetyl-CoA and serotonin. AANAT catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group of Acetyl-CoA to the primary amine of serotonin, thereby producing CoA and N-acetylserotonin. In humans, other endogenous substrates of the enzyme include specific trace amine neuromodulators, namely phenethylamine, tyramine, and tryptamine, in turn forming N-acetylphenethylamine, N-acetyltyramine, and N-acetyltryptamine. 600px In the biosynthesis of melatonin, N-acetylserotonin is further methylated by another enzyme, N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to generate melatonin. The N-acetyltransferase reaction has been suggested to be the rate-determining step, and thus Serotonin N-acetyltransferase has emerged as a target for inhibitor design (see below). AANAT obeys an ordered ternary- complex mechanism. The substrates bind sequentially (ordered) with acetyl-CoA binding to the free enzyme followed by the binding of serotonin to form the ternary complex. After the transfer of the acetyl group has occurred, the products are orderly released with N-acetyl-serotonin first and CoA last.  Structure  Arylkylamine N-acetyltransferase is a monomeric polypeptide with a length of 207 amino acid residues, and with a molecular weight of 23,344 daltons. The secondary structure consists of alpha helices and beta sheets. It is 28% helical (10 helices; 60 residues) and 23% beta sheet (9 strands; 48 residues). This family shares four conserved sequence motifs designated A-D. Motif B serves as the location of the serotonin binding slot. The structure was determined by X-ray diffraction. Several structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and //. Aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase has also been crystallized in complex with 14-3-3ζ from the 14-3-3 protein family, with the PDB accession code . The GNAT superfamily Aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase belongs to the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily which consists 10,000 acetyltransferases, named so because of their sequence homology to a class of eukaryotic transcription factors, therein the yeast GCN5. Other well-studied members of the superfamily are glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase and histone acetyltransferases. All members of this superfamily has a structurally conserved fold consisting of an N-terminal strand followed by two helices, three antiparallel β-strands, followed by a ‘‘signature’’ central helix, a fifth β-strand, a fourth α-helix and a final β-strand. These elements are nearly universally conserved in spite of poor pairwise identity in sequence alignments.  Regulation  Regulation of AANAT varies between species. In some, AANAT levels oscillate dramatically between light and dark periods, and thus control melatonin synthesis. In others, rhythm is regulated primarily on the protein level. One example is in rodents, where AANAT mRNA levels increase more than 100-fold in dark periods. In other species, cyclic AMP plays an important part in inhibition of proteolytic degradation of AANAT, elevating protein levels at night. Experiments using human AANAT expressed in a 1E7 cell line show an ∼8-fold increase in enzyme activity upon exposure to forskolin. Dynamic degradation of AANAT mRNA has proven essential to the circadian action of the enzyme. The 3’UTR sequences have importance with regards to the rhythmic degradation of AANAT mRNA in some species. In rodents, various hnRNPs maintain dynamic degradation of AANAT mRNA. In other species, such as ungulates and primates, the stable AANAT mRNAs with a shorter 3’UTR is suspected not to be under control of the hnRNPs that bind and direct degradation of AANAT mRNA in rodents. Exposure to light induces signals to travel from retinal cells, ultimately causing a drop in norepinephrine stimulation of the pineal gland. This, in turn, leads to a signaling cascade, resulting in Protein Kinase A phosphorylation of two key Ser and Thr residues of serotonin N-acetyltransferase. Phosphorylation of these residues causes changes in catalytic activity through recruitment and interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, specifically 14-3-3ζ. Another protein which interacts and regulates AANAT activity is protein kinase C. Protein kinase C acts, like protein kinase A, on threonine and serine residues, enhancing the stability and enzymatic activity of AANAT. Inhibition of the acetyl-CoA-binding to the catalytic site through the formation and cleavage of intramolecular disulfide bonds has been suggested to be a mechanism of regulation. Formation of a disulfide bond between two cystein residues within the protein closes the hydrophobic funnel of the catalytic site, and thus acts as an on/off switch for catalytic activity. It is not yet certain if this mechanism is present in in vivo cells through the regulation of intracellular redox conditions, but it is suggested that glutathione (GSH) could be an in vivo regulator of the formation and cleavage of these disulfide bonds.  AANAT inhibitors and clinical relevance  Inhibitors of AANAT may eventually lead to development of a drug that would be useful in circadian biology research and in the treatment of sleep and mood disorders. Synthetic inhibitors of the enzyme have been discovered. However, no AANAT inhibitor with potent in vivo activity has been reported. Up to now, five classes of AANAT inhibitors have been described in the literature. Below are the five classes:  Melatonin derivatives  Since it was reported that melatonin is a competitive inhibitor of AANAT, this neurotransmitter seems to exert an autoregulatory control on its own biosynthesis. Thus, loose structural analogues of the indolamine hormone were evaluated on AANAT, and moderate inhibitors were discovered.  Peptidic inhibitors  Peptide combinatorial libraries of tri-, tetra-, and pentapeptides with various amino acid compositions were screened as potential sources of inhibitors, to see if it serves as either pure or mixed competitive inhibitor for the hAANAT enzyme. Molecular modeling and structure-activity relationship studies made it possible to pinpoint the amino acid residue of the pentapeptide inhibitor S 34461 that interacts with the cosubstrate-binding site.  Bisubstrate analogs  It is suggested that AANAT catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to serotonin, with the involvement of an intermediate ternary complex, to produce N-acetylserotonin. Based on this mechanism, it might be expected that a bisubstrate analog inhibitor, derived from the tethering of indole and CoASH parts, could potentially mimic the ternary complex and exert strong inhibition of AANAT. The first bisubstrate analog (1), which links tryptamine and CoA via an acetyl bridge, was synthesized by Khalil and Cole, and shown to be a very potent and specific AANAT inhibitor.  N-Haloacetylated derivatives  AANAT has shown that it also has a secondary alkyltransferase activity as well as acetyltransferase activity. N-Haloacetyltryptamines were developed and serve as substrates of AANAT alkyltransferase and are also potent (low micromolar) in vitro inhibitors against AANAT acetyltransferase activity. AANAT catalyzes reaction between N-bromoacetyltryptamine (BAT) and reduced CoA, resulting a tight-binding bisubstrate analog inhibitor. The first synthesized cell-permeable inhibitor of AANAT N-bromoacetyltryptamine was studied further on melatonin secretion from rat and pig pineal glands. New N-halogenoacetyl derivatives leading to a strong in situ inhibition of AANAT. The concept behind the mechanism of action of these precursors was studied by following the biosynthesis of the inhibitor from tritiated-BAT in a living cell.  Rhodanine-based compounds  The first druglike and selective inhibitors of AANAT has been identified. Lawrence M. Szewczuk et al. have virtually screened more than a million compounds by 3D high-throughput docking into the active site of X-ray structure for AANAT, and then tested 241 compounds as inhibitors. One compound class which containing a rhodanine scaffold has shown low micromolar competitive inhibition against acetyl-CoA and proved to be effective in blocking melatonin production in pineal cells. The recent study about inhibitor of AANAT has described the discovery of a new class of nonpeptidic AANAT inhibitors based on a 2,2′-bithienyl scaffold.

In 1866 he earned his medical doctorate from the University of Dorpat with a thesis concerning the measurement of chloroform in blood, before becoming the first professor of pharmacology at the University of Strasbourg, where he remained for 46 years. In 1911, he testified in the United States v. Forty Barrels & Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola trial, and later, was a major factor in the success of the German pharmaceutical industry prior to the Second World War, having trained most of the European professors at the time. Early life and family Oswald Schmiedeberg was born in Courland, one of the Baltic provinces of Russia. His parents were Wilhelm Schmiedeberg, born 1809 in Windau, Courland, died 1878 in Dorpat, and his wife Lucie Bernard, born 1813 in Lausanne, Switzerland, died 1871. He was the eldest of six siblings. Career In 1866 he earned his medical doctorate from the University of Dorpat with a thesis concerning the measurement of chloroform in blood, titled \\"Determination and Concentration of Chloroform in the Blood\\", and remained an assistant to Rudolf Buchheim at Dorpat (Tartu) until 1869. He was appointed Chair of Pharmacology and for one year then worked with Carl Ludwig at the University of Leipzig. In 1872 he became the first professor of pharmacology at the University of Strasbourg, where he remained for the next 46 years. His work largely dealt with chemicals poisonous to the heart, causing vomiting and those causing passing urine, as well as hypnotics, venoms and metals. With his pupil Hans Horst Meyer he discovered glucuronic acid as a conjugation partner in xenobiotic metabolism and later found that glucuronic acid was also a component of cartilage and occurred as a disaccharide of chondroitin sulfate. He studied the composition of hyaluronic acid and explored its relationship to collagen, amyloid and chondroitin sulfate. In 1869 he demonstrated that muscarine had a similar effect on the heart as electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve. He also demonstrated the hypnotic properties of urethane. In 1911, he testified in the United States v. Forty Barrels & Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola trial. Schmiedeberg was a major factor in the success of the German pharmaceutical industry prior to World War II, having trained most of the professors at the time. He published over 200 scientific books and articles and with pathologists Bernhard Naunyn (1839–1925) and Edwin Klebs (1834–1913), he co-founded the journal Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology.

The soil is favorable for the production and cultivation of cotton especially in some parts of northern Azare, which is conducive for cotton production. However, Azare was agrarian society with majority of the populace depending on farming and animal husbandry as dictated by its climate and soil condition which favours the growing of cereal, Agriculture has great historical achievement in Azare. The rich Fadama being round the region provides fertile agricultural land for cereals, root crops, tree crops such as caltrops and a wider variety of vegetables, millet (Gero), late millet (Maiwa), Sorghum (Dawa), and groundnut and cotton which are the chief export crops and the marketing board recorded 22,271 tons of groundnut, the climate and soil condition also support the production of bean (wake) and cassava (Rogo). Agriculture is the main stay of the economy of Azare. This explains why the vast land coupled with high soil quality makes it possible for about 80-90% of its inhabitants to engage in food and cash crop farming. The major crops produced in the region include cotton, millet, later millet, groundnut and cassava as well as guinea corn. Moreover, Azare is a pluralistic region made up of diverse ethnic and religious groups who have over the time or years cohabited and intermarriages into a burgeoning and vibrant fusion of many culture there over no fewer than four (4) or so ethnic groups in Azare these are Fulani, Hausa, Kare-kare, Bolawa as well as Kanuri which is popularly known as Bare-bari.

Over the years, since 19th century such practices have been completely eradicated. Islam has continued to be the predominant religion despite the fact that, the influx of immigrants has led to the introduction and propagation of Christianity and this resulted of the British colonial missionaries, as a result of this therefore churches have sprung up in most part of the districts of the emirate. However, as it has been said, the overwhelming predominance of the people are Muslim. Indeed, there are many mosques and Arabic schools (Makarantun Allo).

His masterpiece is the Neues Museum in Berlin, as well as the dome of the triumphal arch of the main portal of the Berliner Stadtschloss. His grave in Berlin Life Stüler was born on 28 January 1800 in Mühlhausen. In 1818 he started studying architecture and became a student of Karl Friedrich Schinkel in Berlin. After travelling to France and Italy together with Eduard Knoblauch in 1829 and 1830 and to Russia together with Heinrich Strack in 1831, Stüler became Hofbauinspektor (Royal Buildings Inspector), Hofbaurat (Royal privy councillor for buildings) and director of the commission for the building of the Berliner Stadtschloss in 1832. In 1837, he planned the rebuilding of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, but failed to realise these plans because Tsar Nicholas I of Russia decided to rebuild the original Baroque/Rococo palace instead of Stülers Neo-Renaissance concept. Stüler then returned to Berlin, where King Frederick William IV of Prussia opened a huge array of tasks to him, making him Architekt des Königs (Royal architect) in 1842. Together with King Frederick William, who had previously (since his first journey to Italy in 1828) studied Italian architecture, Stüler incorporated Classical antiquity and Renaissance architecture in what was to become Prussian Arcadia. They also conceived a recourse to early Christian motives such as the liturgy of the Early church to avoid political problems with the contemporary church. After the death of Ludwig Persius, Stüler assumed control of the building of the Friedenskirche in Potsdam in 1845. Joint journeys to Italy of Stüler and King Frederick William in 1858/59 deepened the Italian influence from medieval and Quattrocento buildings. His ideas for Cast-iron architecture or the techniques he used for the Neues Museum are more likely influenced from a journey to England in 1842. The building was badly damaged during World War II, but was reopened in 2009.LORENZ, WERNER. \\"Classicism and High Technology - the Berlin Neues Museum.\\" Construction History 15 (1999): 39-55. http://www.jstor.org/stable/41613794.

Commonly, Stüler is viewed as a student of Karl Friedrich Schinkel as well as an architect of his own right, combining the wishes of Frederick William, Schinkels Classicism and the new Historicism of the Wilhelminian era, though he didn't refer to himself as a student of Schinkel.

Among the 20 standard amino acids, the following are aromatic: phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine. However, in addition to being aromatic, tyrosine can be classified as a polar amino acid. In addition, while histidine contains an aromatic ring, its basic properties cause it to be predominantly classified as a polar amino acid; however, the compound is still aromatic.  Chemical Structure and Properties  Aromatic amino acids absorb ultraviolet light at a wavelength above 250 nm and produce fluorescence. This characteristic is used in quantitative analysis, notably in determining the concentrations of these amino acids in solution. This achieved through the utilization of a UV spectrophotomer and the Beer-Lambert Law equation. Most proteins will have an absorption maximum at 280 nm due to the presence of aromatic amino acids in their primary structure. However, because several aromatic amino acids exist, this method has low accuracy; in order to mitigate this issue, the desired protein must be pure, and its molar absorptivity is known. In addition, a protein without aromatic amino acids will not have an absorption maximum at approximately 280 nm. The presence of nucleic acids in the protein can further decrease the method's accuracy due to the presence of purine and pyrimidine rings, which have an absorption maximum at approximately 260 nm. Phenylalanine has a relatively weak absorbance in comparison to the other standard aromatic amino acids; its presence in a protein can only be detected if tryptophan and tyrosine are not present. Its absorption maximum occurs at 257 nm. Consequently, it has a relatively weak fluorescence. Tryptophan has the highest relative absorbance in comparison to the other standard aromatic amino acids; its absorption maximum occurs at 280 nm. The side chain of tryptophan does not titrate. The absorption maximum of tyrosine occurs at 274 nm. In chemical reactions, tyrosine can function as a nucleophile. Aromatic amino acids also play a crucial role in glycan-protein interactions.181x181px  Occurrence and Functions in Biochemistry = Biosynthesis Pathways  Shikimate Pathway = In plants, the shikimate pathway first leads to the formation of chorismate, which is the precursor of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. These aromatic amino acids are the derivatives of many secondary metabolites, all essential to a plant's biological functions, such as the hormones salicylate and auxin. This pathway contains enzymes that can be regulated by inhibitors, which can cease the production of chorismate, and ultimately the organism's biological functions. Herbicides and antibiotics work by inhibiting these enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, thereby rendering them toxic to plants. Glyphosate, a type of herbicide, is used to control the accumulation of excess greens. In addition to destroying greens, Glyphosate can easily affect the maintenance of the gut microbiota in host organisms by specifically inhibiting the 5-enolpyruvylshikinate-3-phosphate synthase which prevents the biosynthesis of essential aromatic amino acids. Inhibition of this enzyme results in disorders such as gastrointestinal diseases and metabolic diseases. Diagram of the Shikimate Pathway, and examples of amino acids serving as precursors. = Aromatic Amino Acids as Precursors = Aromatic amino acids often serve as the precursors to other molecules. For instance, in the production of epinephrine, phenylalanine is the starting molecule. The reaction is indicated below: Phenylalanine → Tyrosine → L-DOPA → Dopamine → Norepinephrine → Epinephrine Tyrosine is also a precursor for the synthesis of octopamine and melanin in numerous organisms. In the production of thyroxine, phenylalanine also serves as the initial precursor: Phenylalanine → Tyrosine → Thyroxine In the production of serotonin, tryptophan is the starting molecule, as indicated below: Tryptophan → 5-hydroxytryptophan → Serotonin In addition, histidine is the precursor to histamine. Tryptophan is the starting molecule in the synthesis of tryptamine, serotonin, auxin, kynurenines, and melatonin.  Nutritional Requirements  Animals obtain aromatic amino acids from their diet, but all plants and micro-organisms must synthesize their aromatic amino acids through the metabolically costly shikimate pathway in order to make them. Phenylalanine, tryptophan, and histidine are essential amino acids for animals. Since they are not synthesized in the human body, they must be derived from the diet. Tyrosine is semi-essential; therefore, it can be synthesized by the animal, but only from phenylalanine. Phenylketonuria, a genetic disorder that occurs as a result of the inability to breakdown phenylalanine, is due to a lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. A dietary lack of tryptophan can cause stunted skeletal development. There is evidence to suggest that a high dietary intake of aromatic amino acids may increase the rate of hypertension, although more research is required. Blue diaper syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease that is caused by poor tryptophan absorption in the body.

G. Paley (3 September 1823 – 23 January 1895), was an English architect who practised in Lancaster, Lancashire, in the second half of the 19th century. After leaving school in 1838, he went to Lancaster to become a pupil of Edmund Sharpe, and in 1845 he joined Sharpe as a partner. Sharpe retired from the practice in 1851, leaving Paley as the sole principal. In 1868 Hubert Austin joined him as a partner, and in 1886 Paley's son Henry (who was usually known as Harry) also became a partner. This partnership continued until Edward Paley's death in 1895. Paley's major work was the design of new churches, but he also rebuilt, restored, and made additions and alterations to existing churches. His major new ecclesiastical design was that of St Peter's Church, Lancaster, which became Lancaster Cathedral. He also carried out secular commissions, mainly on country houses in the north-west of England. His largest and most important secular work was the Royal Albert Asylum in Lancaster. When designing churches, Paley mainly used the Gothic Revival style, but in his secular works he employed a greater variety of styles, including Tudor Revival and Scottish Baronial as well as Gothic Revival. Paley played little part in the political life of Lancaster, but he was involved with cultural events and sports in the town. His interests included music and archaeology, and he was involved in archery and rowing. In addition to designing the Royal Albert Asylum, he served on its committee, as well as being on the committees of local schools and the Mechanics' Institute. His work tended to be eclipsed in the later part of his career by Austin, and Paley is regarded as having been a competent architect, rather than a great one. Early life Edward Paley was born in Easingwold, North Yorkshire, the seventh child and the fourth son of Revd Edmund Paley and Sarah née Apthorp. His older brother, Frederick Apthorp Paley, was a classical scholar. His father was the local vicar, who in turn was second son of William Paley, the Christian apologist. Edward was initially educated at home, and later at Christ's Hospital when it was situated in London. From school he went directly to Lancaster in 1838 to become a pupil of the architect Edmund Sharpe at the age of 15. Career and works alt=A stone Gothic style church with a tall steeple 1845–68 In 1845, after Paley had completed his articles, Sharpe appointed him as a partner in the practice, which was known as Sharpe and Paley, Architects, (or more usually as Sharpe & Paley). Sharpe then paid more attention to his interests outside the practice, and from 1847 Paley was carrying out most of the work. In 1851, the year of Paley's marriage to Sharpe's sister, Sharpe formally retired from the practice, leaving Paley as sole principal. The practice continued to use the title Sharpe and Paley until 1856, the year Sharpe moved to North Wales; the title was then changed to E. G. Paley. In 1860 Paley moved his office from St Leonard's Gate to 32 Castle Hill (later 24 Castle Park). This building was to serve the practice for the rest of its existence until it closed in 1946. In 1871 Paley took over the ownership of the building. Between 1845 and 1851 it is difficult to determine how much responsibility each partner took in the commissions undertaken by the practice, but from 1851 it was Paley who was individually responsible. The two partners did work together on the remodelling of Capernwray Hall, and in the rebuilding of All Saints' Church, Wigan. Throughout Paley's career, the design of new churches was his major source of work. Between 1851 and 1867 he was responsible for about 36 new or rebuilt churches. During the 1850s his new churches included St Patrick, Preston Patrick, St Peter, Rylstone (both 1852–53), St Anne, Thwaites (1853–54), Christ Church, Bacup, (1854), and St George, Barrow-in-Furness (1859–60). All these churches were Anglican, but in 1857 came a commission for a Roman Catholic church, St Peter, Lancaster, (which in 1924 became Lancaster Cathedral). With its spire rising to , it is considered to be Paley's finest design. Later major new churches include St Peter, Quernmore, St Anne, Singleton (both 1859–60), St Mark, Preston (1862–63), Holy Trinity, Bury (1863–64), St James, Poolstock (1863–66), St James, Barrow (1867–69), and his most substantial church of this period, St Peter, Bolton (1867–71). Paley also designed a great variety of secular buildings, the most important of which was the Royal Albert Asylum (1868–73), the largest building ever undertaken by the practice. He carried out much work on schools, designing town and village schools, and designing extensions for larger schools, including work for Giggleswick School (1849–51) and, for Rossall School, a chapel (1861–62) and a new east wing (1867). Paley carried out commissions for country houses, including the rebuilding of Wennington Hall (1855–56), and a new house, The Ridding in Bentham, North Yorkshire (1857–60). There was also a variety of smaller works, including a music hall in Settle, cemetery buildings in Lancaster and Stalmine, and industrial buildings. Paley's career coincided with the growth of the town of Barrow-in-Furness and the development of the Furness Railway and, being the major architect in the area, he gained many commissions relating to the town and the railway. He developed working relationships with the major entrepreneurs, James Ramsden, and Henry Schneider, for whom he designed both domestic and industrial buildings. An early commission was to convert a former manor house into the Furness Abbey Hotel for the railway (1847–48). He later designed a large country house for Ramsden, Abbot's Wood (1857–59, since demolished). Paley's first station for the railway was Strand station in Barrow (1863, since demolished). Subsequently, the practice was to be responsible for most of the buildings required for the railway. 1868–95 alt=A stone church seen from the west with a broad battlemented tower From 1868 until his death in 1895 Paley worked in partnerships. He was joined by Hubert Austin in 1868, when the practice became known as Paley and Austin. Paley's son Henry, usually known as Harry, joined the partnership in 1886, when the practice became Paley, Austin and Paley, a title it retained until Edward Paley's death. From 1868 it is difficult to know what part any one partner contributed to any particular project. Almost all the works were attributed to the partnership as a whole, and not to an individual partner. What is certain is that the firm enjoyed its most successful period and designed most of its most admired buildings during these years. New features appeared, including what Brandwood et al. describe as \\"a new-found muscularity which tended to be uncharacteristic of Paley's work\\". Although Paley had occasionally used Perpendicular features in his churches, these were used much more frequently, so much so that the practice is credited with playing a part in what Brandwood et al. term the \\"Perpendicular revival in the North\\", and even with playing a \\"nationally pioneering role\\" in the \\"rehabilitation of the Perpendicular style as an acceptable stylistic choice\\". In addition, later in this period, the use of features derived from the Aesthetic Movement was introduced. It is not known what part Edward Paley played in these developments, but Brandwood et al. argue that they are \\"undoubtedly attributable to the influence of Austin\\". This is not to down-play the work done by Paley during this period. Brandwood et al. point out that of the two, Paley had the more outgoing personality, and because of this, and because of his senior position, the writers suggest that he, rather than Austin, would \\"tend to 'front' many of the dealings of the firm\\". They also suggest that Paley would be more at ease in dealing with patrons, such as the Duke of Devonshire, in discussing the rebuilding of Holker Hall after the fire of 1871, and that he would have played a greater part in training the pupils in the practice. Paley did have some individual responsibilities within the practice. He took over from Sharpe as Bridgemaster of the South Lonsdale Hundred in 1860, and in 1868 he was appointed as inspector of Lancaster Gaol and the Judge's Lodgings. He served on the committee of the Royal Albert Asylum for many years, taking much interest in its management. He was a director of the Lancaster Waggon Company, for whom he designed their factory, the Lancaster Carriage and Wagon Works (1864–65). In his role as bridgemaster he was responsible for the new road bridge over the River Lune at Caton (1882–83) following its collapse in 1881. Paley became a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1871, served on its council for two periods, and at the time of his death was one of its examiners. Architectural styles Royal Albert Asylum, Lancaster, showing the tower with its French featuresalt=Part of a three-storey building with a tower surmounted by a Mansard roof During the first half of the 19th century ecclesiastical architecture was moving away from the Neoclassical style towards Gothic. Initially the churches in Gothic Revival style incorporated Gothic-like features, such as lancet windows, and towers with pinnacles and crockets. This was known as a pre-archaeological style and was used in the first phase of the Commissioners' Churches. A. W. N. Pugin argued that these features should correctly and accurately reflect medieval Gothic architecture rather than mimic it, and Sharpe became an expert in this movement. Paley learned much of this from Sharpe and as a consequence incorporated \\"correct\\" Gothic features in his own work. At the same time the Cambridge Camden Society, influenced by the Oxford Movement, were advocating a more sacramental form of liturgy, which required a larger chancel than that normally provided in the Commissioners' Churches. Paley was also influenced in this by his brother, Frederick, who was a member of the Camden Society and was himself an expert on medieval architecture. Most of Paley's churches followed precedents from the 13th and 14th centuries, and were in Early English, or in Decorated style, mainly the latter. Their common plan consisted of open roofs, benches for the congregation, stalls in the chancel, a pulpit to the side of the entrance to the chancel, steps leading up to the chancel, and a font at the west end. Paley is not seen as an innovator in church design, and he did not use devices such as polychromy, which was being introduced elsewhere. He did however introduce Perpendicular features into some of his designs, for example, St Patrick, Preston Patrick, St Peter, Rylstone (both 1852–53), and in the rebuilding of St Paul's Church, Brookhouse (1865–67). Paley's early new churches had plastered interiors, but in 1860 he introduced an interior of bare brick in St Peter, Quernmore. This feature was repeated in a similar manner in later churches including St Mark, Preston, and St James, Barrow. In his secular commissions, Paley employed a greater variety of architectural styles, including features of Tudor Revival architecture. The earliest major building in which he used this style was Wennington Hall (1855–56). As a contrast was the country house, The Ridding (1857–60), which is in Scottish Baronial style, the only building in which he used this style. Another building in Tudor style is the country house Eccle Riggs (1865). His most important building, the Royal Albert Asylum (1868–73), is Gothic in style, but, in the opinion of Hartwell and Pevsner, it incorporates French features, in particular the steep hipped roof of the central tower. After Hubert Austin joined the practice, it becomes difficult to determine the specific input of any individual partner. New architectural features were introduced, and Brandwood et al. consider that Paley \\"tends to be overshadowed\\" by Austin, but the practice continued to design fine buildings throughout the time that Paley was a principal. Personal life alt=A stone church seen from the south-west with a large battlemented tower Edward Paley married Frances Sharpe, Edmund Sharpe's sister, in June 1851. They had five children: three daughters followed by two sons, the youngest of whom, Henry Anderson (known as Harry), joined his father as a partner in the practice. The family lived initially at 35 Castle Park, near Lancaster Castle, before moving to a house to the south of Lancaster called The Greaves, which Paley designed himself. He also converted a former workhouse into a country house for himself, called Moorgarth, at Brookhouse, near Caton to the north-east of Lancaster. Paley was a keen Anglican churchman, initially attending Lancaster Priory, and later St Paul's Church, Brookhouse, a church that he largely rebuilt in 1866–67. Paley took little interest in local politics, although he did serve as a Conservative councillor for three years from 1858; he declined to be renominated at the end of his term. He was involved in other ways in social concerns, serving on the committees of local schools and the Mechanics' Institute. He also played a major part in establishing the Royal Albert Asylum, designing the building and serving on its committee. Paley shared sporting and musical interests with Sharpe, being a member of the John O'Gaunt Bowmen, and helping Sharpe to set up the Lancaster Rowing Club. Paley and his wife were members of the Lancaster Choral Society, Paley was involved with the Athenaeum Company and the Lancaster Philosophical Society, and in 1873 founded the County Club, a gentleman's club in Lancaster. He was also interested in archaeology, and was a founder member of the Royal Archaeological Society, and a member of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society. Death Paley died on 23 January 1895, having suffered from typhoid fever for 20 days. Although he had not played a prominent role in the political life of Lancaster he had been active in the life of the town, and was given a civic funeral; he was buried in Lancaster Cemetery. His estate amounted to £71,939 (). Appraisal Hartwell and Pevsner consider that the architectural partnership of Austin and Paley \\"did more outstanding work than any other in the county\\", and that this work was \\"outstanding in the national as well as the regional context\\". Although during the time of the Paley and Austin partnership, Austin has been given more credit for the originality of the designs, Paley had a good reputation as a church architect in his own right. After his death the Architect & Contract Reporter carried an article highlighting this aspect of his work. In respect of St Peter, Lancaster (later Lancaster Cathedral), Brandwood et al. consider it to be \\"Paley's masterpiece as an independent church architect\\". In 1901 the German architect and critic Hermann Muthesius mentioned it in his survey of English churches \\"with some enthusiasm\\". Nikolaus Pevsner writing in 1969 described it as \\"a fine, aspiring building\\", and Pevsner's successors in the Buildings of England series describe it as his \\"chef d'oeuvre\\". Later Paley's work tended to be overshadowed by Austin, although it is usually impossible to determine which partner was responsible for which design. Paley has been described as being \\"an attractive individual, popular and a leading figure in the life of Lancaster\\". His obituary in the Lancaster Guardian described him as \\"one of nature's gentlemen, always cheerful and kindly ... esteemed and respected by all\\".

The small settlement is mainly known for Ossiach Abbey. Geography It is located at the southern shore of Lake Ossiach, on the slope of the small Ossiacher Tauern range within the Nock Mountains, a range of the Gurktal Alps, at the road between Villach and Feldkirchen. The commune consists of the Katastralgemeinden Alt-Ossiach, Ossiach, Ostriach, Rappitsch, Tauern and Untertauern. History Ossiach Abbey Ossiach Abbey was founded about 1000. The monastery church was mentioned in a 1028 deed, hence the first of the Benedictine Order in the Duchy of Carinthia. The abbey developed to an ecclesiastical and cultural centre of the region, though no larger homestead arose outside its walls. After the dissolution of the monastery by the order of Emperor Joseph II in 1783, the rural area from 1850 was part of neighbouring Steindorf. The Ossiach municipality was not established until 1904. Today the church is also renowned for the Carinthischer Sommer classical music festival, held around July and August each year. The pianist Wilhelm Backhaus held his last concert here on June 29, 1969. Since 1974, the abbey has held church opera productions, particularly the parables of Benjamin Britten, as well as other theatrical productions. Some Austrians have written works specifically for the festival, including Cesar Bresgen (Das Spiel vom Menschen, 1982) and Dieter Kaufmann (Bruder Boleslaw, 1989). A chapel of ease stands in the village of Tauern. First mentioned in 1290, the Tauernkirche was rebuilt in 1519 in a Late Gothic style and received a Baroque equipment including a high altar in the 17th century.

A single prototype was built, but declines in rail passenger traffic resulted in a lack of orders so Budd re-designed the concept as an electric multiple unit (m.u.). Six of the EMU coach design were purchased by the Pennsylvania Railroad with the intention of using them as a high-speed self-contained coach that could be used for long-distance commuter or short-distance intercity travel in the Northeast U.S. The 6 production Pioneer III units were the first all- stainless-steel-bodied EMU railcar built in North America and, at , the lightest. Lightweight coach The Pioneer III lightweight coach (Budd serial number 3880) was completed in 1956 and was seen by the Budd Company as a milestone product that could revolutionize the passenger railcar market. With this assessment in mind, the Pioneer III name was chosen in reference to the Budd Pioneer stainless steel aircraft and the Pioneer Zephyr lightweight trainset. The coach was designed for medium- or short-distance inter-city passenger travel with extreme emphasis placed on saving weight. This was accomplished through the use of electric train heat and air conditioning in place of steam and mechanical systems, high-speed inboard bearing trucks that used air suspension instead of heavier springs, an airline-style bathroom instead of the fully equipped \\"lounge\\" style and a thin corrugated stainless steel carbody. The result was a car that weighed only , nearly half the amount of the then state-of-the-art \\"lightweight\\" stainless steel cars being manufactured by Budd. With a capacity of 88 passengers in a 2+2 seating configuration, the Pioneer III coach achieved a weight-to-passenger ratio, a number not seen since the days when passenger cars had been made out of wood. Unfortunately, these remarkable statistics were accomplished at the expense of comfort, as passengers were provided with significantly reduced legroom compared to other coaches in the same class and a bouncier ride. The Pioneer III coach concept toured numerous North American railroads as a demonstrator unit, but due to the general decline in rail passenger traffic there was little interest in new rolling stock, especially one that represented a new and untested model. Electric Multiple Unit Budd Pioneer III lightweight truck. Note non-standard right-angle gearbox. Finding no takers for the Pioneer III coach, Budd re-worked the design into an Electric Multiple Unit for commuter operations by fitting a propulsion system and a vestibule type operating cab at each end. The Pennsylvania Railroad's increasingly antiquated fleet of MP54 suburban MU's prompted the railroad to order 6 Pioneer III MU's from Budd in 1958. Measuring roughly 85 feet in length and 10 feet in width, the Pioneer III coach resembled the stainless steel coaches used by the Pennsylvania Railroad for its premier New York City-Washington, D.C. and New York City-Chicago services. Seating on the Pioneer III was in two rows of 25 in a 3+2 configuration. Like all m.u. coaches, the Pioneer III was capable of running as a single-car train or with up to six cars total, depending on the number of passengers it was to carry. The Pioneer III car had an advertised speed of 100 m.p.h., but in actual operations ran at speeds of around 80–85 m.p.h. Its knuckle-shaped (tightlock) couplers, identical to those found on the PRR long-distance trains, allowed the Pioneer III coaches to be transported to shop facilities in Paoli or Wilmington for maintenance. The original numbers were 150-155 with the even-numbered cars having fabricated truck frames and disc brakes, while the odd-numbered cars had cast steel truck frames and tread brakes. The cars used the revolutionary, and aptly named, Budd Pioneer III truck, which was a lightweight, inboard bearing railroad bogie designed for high-speed operation. This truck would see continued use by Budd on its subsequent Silverliner order, as well as MUs ordered by the Long Island Rail Road and Metro North, PATCO rapid transit cars and the Amtrak Amfleet cars, where they would operate up to speeds of . The Pioneer III cars used a slightly different right-angle gearbox (adapted from the very successful Budd-built PTC M-3 transit cars) set the traction motors at a right angle to the axle instead of the more common lateral placement. The need for a larger traction motor resulted in the change to the more traditional layout in the Silverliner II design. Power was collected from a diamond-shaped pantograph, and the control system consisted of a step-down transformer connected to an AC/DC rectifier powered by mercury arc ignitron tubes. The DC output was then fed into a camshaft motor controller which provided for smooth acceleration. No dynamic braking system was fitted. In 1961 the mercury arc tubes were replaced by silicon diode rectifiers. The thin stainless steel carbody and other elements of the Pioneer III design combined with the lightness of the traction components resulted in the Pioneer III MU cars being the lightest all-metal electric multiple unit railroad passenger cars produced in North America. Unfortunately there were reliability and performance issues with the small traction motors and low capacity main transformer. Service history A Pioneer III car at 30th Street Station in 1976 Although the Pioneer III design was advanced for its time, operating headaches and a ready stream of available GG1 locomotive-hauled coaches spelled a premature end to the Pioneer III coaches in long-distance passenger service. In 1963, as part of an effort to improve commuter rail service in the Philadelphia area, the PRR contracted with the Budd Company to build a more advanced version of the Pioneer III design. Using the Pioneer III as a model, the new \\"Silverliner\\", as the stainless steel MU coaches were called, differed greatly from the Pioneers. They all had fabricated trucks with air springs and disc brakes, more powerful traction motors, two rows of ceiling lights, improved air- conditioning, the use of an automatic MU coupler that automatically made electrical connections in addition to the usual AAR \\"knuckle\\" design and a sleeker T-shaped (Faiveley) pantograph in place of the diamond-shaped pantograph. Thirty-eight Silverliner cars (201-219, 251-269) were built for the PRR, with 17 nearly identical cars (9001-9017) for the Reading Company tacked onto the same order. After taking delivery of the 38 Silverliner cars, the PRR took the Pioneer III cars off intercity operations and used them exclusively on Philadelphia-area commuter service. In 1967, when SEPTA and the PRR took delivery of a second \\"Silverliner\\" MU car order from the St. Louis Car Company, the first (1963) \\"Silverliner\\" delivery became the \\"Silverliner II\\" cars and the 1967 order, the \\"Silverliner III.\\" Although still officially called the Pioneer III, these cars were retroactively given the \\"Silverliner I\\" designation. As part of the Penn Central merger, the cars were also renumbered, out of sequence, to 294-299. By that time, the three disc-braked cars, together with all of the PRR Silverliner IIs, had been retrofitted with tread brakes, with which the Silverliner IIIs came equipped. During the 1974–75 delivery of the \\"Silverliner IV\\" cars from General Electric numbered PC 270-303, the Pioneers were renumbered 244–248 (the 249 had been wrecked and retired by that time) to form a solid block of MU's containing both the new cars and existing Silverliner II and III cars. After purchasing a number of push-pull trainsets and AEM7s in 1987, SEPTA found itself possessing a sufficient number of Silverliner II, III and IV MU cars to retire the Pioneer III/Silverliner I cars. Retirement finally came with the spring timetable change on April 1, 1990, due to a requirement by Amtrak that all locomotives and self-propelled railcars operating on the Northeast Corridor be equipped with a new type of train control, a result of a 1987 train collision. Until 2000, the cars were kept in storage near Wayne Junction. Although there were plans to convert the cars into locomotive-hauled coaches, SEPTA finally decided to dispose of the fleet due to the expense it would have taken to deal with PCBs in the transformers and the lack of ADA compliance. Of the 5 remaining Pioneer III/Silverliner I cars, three of the cars were sent to the AAR/FRA test site in Pueblo, Colorado, for use in crash tests, while the remaining two cars were donated to the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg. The cars sent to the test site and the museum have since been scrapped. Gas turbine demonstrator In 1966 the Budd Company in cooperation with Garrett AiResearch used the surplus Pioneer III demonstration coach as the basis for the first gas turbine-powered railcar in North America. The coach, re-christened GT-1, was to be supplied to the Long Island Rail Road for testing on its non-electrified branch lines as a way to provide high speed MU operation without the need to extend the electrification. The single entry vestibule was converted into a vestibule cab, with a second, doorless cab being constructed on the \\"blind\\" end of the coach. The GT-1 used a mechanical drive, with the output shaft of the gas turbine being connected to the driving wheels via a mechanical gearbox. The GT-1 was tested on the LIRR from September, 1966 to May, 1967. In 1969 the GT-1 was rebuilt using funds from the Urban Mass Transit Administration into a hybrid turbo-electric railcar, replacing the mechanical drive with an electrical generator providing power to 4, 150 hp traction motors. Re-classified again as GT-2, the coach was intended to test gas turbine railcar operation into the confines of New York Pennsylvania Station and therefore was also given the capability to draw power from the 700 VDC third rail. The GT-2 was also notable for being one of the first rail vehicles to be equipped with DC chopper propulsion control. The Pioneer III coach in the GT-2 configuration was tested from November, 1969 to December, 1970.http://www.trainsarefun.com/lirr/gasturbinecars/gasturbinecars.htm See also *Budd Silverliner *Silverliner *ACMU References Budd multiple units Rail passenger cars of the United States Electric multiple units of the United States ","title":"Pioneer III (railcar)"},{"id":"9579287","text":"Synthetic Marble sculpture by Nick Hornby in Andaz 5th Avenue, 485 5th Avenue at 41st Street, New York, USA Nick Hornby (born 1980) is a British artist.

The complex of buildings home to the school is bounded by Leopold Street, West Street, Orchard Lane, and Holly Street.  Origin  During the late 19th century Sheffield city centre underwent a significant redevelopment. Along with concepts of mass production the industrial revolution encouraged the development of mass education. This collection of education buildings was the synthesis of this concept in Sheffield. The Schools were established to provide a technical knowledge base to support the emerging manufacturing industries of the age and no doubt have contributed to Sheffield’s position as the most significant steel manufacturing city in the world.  History  The key buildings on the site were built between 1874 and 1894. The buildings are robust ornate stone structures typical of the civic architecture of the time generally described as English Renaissance Revivalist in style. Initial drawings for the Central Schools development were produced following the Education Act of 1870, the buildings were also to house the Sheffield Schools Board formed out of the Act. The construction was to commence in 1876 following acquisition of the land which was formerly home to workshops, and terrace housing. The first buildings on the site were designed by Local Architect T R Flockton in collaboration with E R Robson and were technically advanced for their time incorporating heating and ventilation techniques that were rarely seen, not only distributing warm/cool air but also purifying the incoming air from the many external pollutants. The Houses of Parliament in London was the only other building of the time to utilise such technology. The site was initially home to the Firth College, the Central Technical Schools and the Sheffield Schools Board. These first buildings were completed by 1880. The Firth College is specifically notable for its benefactor: Mark Firth - a successful local steel manufacturer and philanthropist, and for later becoming the University of Sheffield following its amalgamation with the Technical School and Medical School in Sheffield in 1897 and moving to a new larger site 8 years later. Former infants school The school was extended between 1894 and 1899 with a building on Bow Street (no longer a road) to form an infants school with a roof-top playground, and the Pupil Teacher Centre on Holly Street which was built in a Gothic Revival style of architecture by H W Lockwood. As Urban populations migrated to the suburbs throughout the twentieth century the role of the Central School increasingly became unworkable, eventually leading to its closure in the 1930s. The school re- opened as High Storrs School in Ecclesall, and the association for former pupils of High Storrs retains the historical connection in its name, the Old Centralians.Old Centralians website , History page There were two commemorative plaques erected detailing the buildings' history. The wording is reproduced here: THE CITY OF SHEFFIELD EDUCATION OFFICES. OPENED IN 1879 AS FIRTH COLLEGE THROUGH THE GENEROSITY OF MARK FIRTH (1819–1980), AN EMINENT LOCAL STEEL MAKER AND MANUFACTURER, THE COLLEGE WAS A CENTRE FOR POPULAR LECTURES AND UNIVERSITY EXTENSION CLASSES AND, ALONGSIDE SHEFFIELD MEDICAL SCHOOL, WAS THE FORERUNNER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD. FROM 1905 TO 1963, THESE BUILDINGS SERVED AS PREMISES FOR A VARIETY OF LOCAL SCHOOLS, THE LAST OF WHICH WAS THE CENTRAL TECHNICAL SCHOOL FOR BOYS. THIS PLAQUE WAS SPONSORED BY STONES BITTER. and THE CITY OF SHEFFIELD EDUCATION OFFICES. FROM 1933 TO 1964 FIRTH BUILDING WAS USED BY THE CENTRAL TECHNICAL SCHOOL, FORMERLY THE JUNIOR TECHNICAL SCHOOL. DURING THAT TIME, OVER 15,000 BOYS PASSED THROUGH THE SCHOOL, MANY PROGRESSING TO SUCCESSFUL CAREERS IN THE STEEL, ENGINEERING AND BUILDING INDUSTRIES OF THE REGION. THE FIRST HEADMASTER, GWILYM E. THOMAS, WAS SUCCEEDED BY HERBERT W. WADGE M.B.E. WHO WAS PROMINENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SECONDARY TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN THIS COUNTRY. HERBERT WADGE HAD A PROFOUND LIFE-LONG INFLUENCE ON ALL HIS PUPILS. FLOURISH CTS FOR EVER THIS PLAQUE HAS BEEN SPONSORED BY C.T.S. OLD BOYS ASSOCIATION. GOLDEN JUBILEE YEAR 1996 \\"Flourish CTS for ever\\" is a reference to the refrain of the School's song which was written by Wadge. (Some have noted, here, a similarity to the school song of Westminster College 'From the Cheviots down to Dover')  Ethos  Under its headmaster, Herbert W. Wadge, CTS selected its (single-sex) pupils from across the city by means of an entrance examination at age 13 years. There were two streams: Engineering and Building to cater to the city's industrial nature. There was an emphasis on both the practical and the academic with courses such as Pattern Making/Foundry Practice and Brickwork. The school offered its own diploma for those leaving before taking nationally recognised qualifications at 'O' and 'A' levels.  Later development  The Leopold Street/West Street site was home to the city's education offices together with the Sheffield City Grammar School and the Central Technical School. It was quite compact. Consequently, the playing fields for the schools were located at two sites at Ringinglow. As the Central Technical School expanded, additional premises were found in Queens Street near the corner of Silver Street, not far from Sheffield Cathedral. \\"Cathedral School\\" provided a school meals service and additional class rooms. Space at the school was at such a premium that tin-smithing and plumbing were taught in a building on Arundel Street adjacent to the rear of the Central Library (Sheffield) upstairs was a bakehouse where cooking & baking were taught but not to the Central Technical school students. Eventually, in the early 1960s, the City Grammar School was relocated to Stradbroke and was later renamed \\"The City School (Sheffield)\\". Shortly afterward, in 1964, CTS was relocated under its existing headmaster, Herbert.W. Wadge, to its own purpose-built premises on the outskirts of the city at Gleadless Road, Gleadless. Peter Dixon, took over as headmaster in 1965 and the school eventually became co-educational in 1968, merging with the adjacent Hurlfield Girls School and changing its name to 'Ashleigh School'. In 1988 Ashleigh School merged with Hurlfield School and became 'Myrtle Springs School'. The former Hurlfield Girls site was not required as part of the merger and demolished, and in the mid 1990s the former CTS site became redundant and was also later demolished to make way for houses. The original buildings in Leopold Street were occupied by the education offices of Sheffield City Council up until 2001 when it was redeveloped into apartments, a hotel, and bars/restaurants, by local architects Axis Architecture.

Financial regulators in Germany, Belgium and 15 other countries have banned the sale of financial products from SkyWay or warned the public about a potential scam. Overview The SkyWay Group technology is referred to as \\"string transport\\" and involves the movement of driverless vehicles on sleeperless tracks elevated above the ground on concrete supports. The \\"strings\\" are a bundle of prestressed tensioned steel wires placed in a concrete-filled body. The SkyWay technology has been marketed as a new type of elevated light rail transportation system. SkyWay has been designed to transport passengers and cargo. Yunitskiy claims his vehicles can reach speeds of up to 500 kilometers an hour and are reported to cost 20 percent less than normal subways. It is also claimed that this technology involves minimal gas and particle emissions. SkyWay claims that its small transport units with variable passengers capacity can travel safely at intervals of only 2 seconds, thus providing a transport capacity of up to 50,000 passengers per hour. History SkyWay test track built in Ozyory, Russia in 2001 which was later deconstructed Anatoly Yunitskiy is the inventor of SkyWay technology and is also the founder, the director and the main shareholder of companies in the SkyWay Group. He designed the technology in 1980 as a system of passenger and cargo capsules that travel by cable car. In 2001 a prototype of a SkyWay track was constructed in the Russian village Ozyory in Moscow Oblast. The allowable load on this track was tested there using a truck with iron wheels. This site was later deconstructed. A prototype was assessed in Russia in 2008 by the Moscow State University of Railway Engineering concluding that it was \\"not viable and unsafe\\". In October 2015 the SkyWay Group started constructing a test site to demonstrate 'SkyWay' technology. It is situated in Marjina Horka (about 70 km from Minsk) and is called the EcoTechnoPark. In 2016, a Russian government panel that evaluated the technology called it innovative, but only in theory. A prototype of the technology reached speeds of 102 kilometers per hour in 2017. In August 2018 at the EcoFest event, there were three tracks demonstrating prototypes at this site. One is for a vehicle with a maximum capacity of 48 people. The second track is for a 14-seater vehicle and the third is for a 6-seater vehicle. Operations= Company structure  SkyWay Group consists of numerous subsidiaries. The SkyWay Group deals with construction of the technology through numerous subsidiaries. SkyWay Group of Companies controls SkyWay Capital which was launched in 2014 to self-finance the projects. They also own and control other companies like \\"SWIG International Ltd.\\" registered in London and \\"SkyWay Capital Inc.\\" which is registered in Saint Lucia. These companies function to collect funds for SkyWay projects. Established in Belarus, operated from an office complex in Minsk and registered under business names including \\"Euroasian Rail Skyway Systems Holding Ltd.\\", \\"First SkyWay Invest Group Limited\\" and \\"Global Transport Investment Inc.\\" in places like the British Virgin Islands, London and Saint Lucia. It has been documented that companies in the SkyWay Group seek potential investors all over the world for the development of an elevated rail transport technology they refer to as SkyWay.  Marketing  The SkyWay Group exhibited a monorail vehicle at the InnoTrans trade fair in Berlin in 2018. In addition to demonstration models at the EcoTechnoPark in Belarus, the company has exhibited its technology at trade fairs like the 3rd Singapore International Transport Congress and Exhibition (SITCE). The SkyWay Group markets itself primarily by promoting investment in its technology to small investors. SkyWay Group seeks investors through its website and social media. The SkyWay Group have been seeking potential investors all over the world using various forms of marketing such as crowdfunding, telemarketing and multi-level marketing. It has also been documented that the SkyWay Group promote their technology with paid advertising on television and in newspapers, and that financial services are being offered via social media. The company \\"Sky Way Invest Group Limited\\" also launched financial training courses for a fee which it marketed as 'Educational Investment Packages' (EIPs). CONSOB, the Italian financial regulatory agency, banned the sale and advertisement of these investment products in February 2018 because it turned out instead of receiving the \\"investment training courses\\" advertised, customers unwittingly ended up with \\"gift certificates\\" that could later be converted to company shares on the occasion of its IPO.  Negotiations  Although countries like Australia, India, Indonesia, Italy and Lithuania started negotiating with the SkyWay Group, they were later cancelled or postponed due to concerns about safety and financial irregularity. Projects are being realized in Belarus and in the United Arab Emirates. The most recent negotiations have taken place in the United Arab Emirates. The SkyWay Group started negotiating with countries like Lithuania, Australia, Slovakia, India, Italy and Indonesia. =Lithuania= The municipality of Siauliai in Lithuania signed an investment agreement with SkyWay in 2014. The mayor of Siauliai was later criticized for negotiating with the SkyWay Group and at the end of 2014 he was instructed to cancel the negotiations. In 2014, the Bank of Lithuania released an official statement warning investors of SkyWay. An investigation by the country's Prosecutor General's office found no evidence to prosecute the company. A subsequent lawsuit by SkyWay against the Lithuanian government was dismissed in 2018. =Australia= In 2016 in South Australia, SkyWay negotiated with Flinders University to build a 500 meter long line for $13 million Australian dollars under the direction of ex-state transport minister Rod Hook who worked for SkyWay as an infrastructure consultant. These negotiations were eventually postponed indefinitely in August 2018, as they opted for driverless busses instead. =Slovakia= In July 2016 SkyWay signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava to promote SkyWay technology in Slovakia. =India= In May 2017 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the minister of Urban Development of the Northern Indian state Himachal Pradesh with SkyWay Group. The minister who negotiated with SkyWay was criticised for doing so \\"without following proper procedures\\" Critics also questioned why an agreement was signed with a company that had no operational projects, and for the suitability of the technology to be used in the region. As a result, negotiations in India have been postponed. =Indonesia= In September 2017 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the University of Indonesia in West Java to build on-campus 'sky trains'. In December 2017 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed in Jakarta for a proposed project in Kalimantan. In February 2018 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the Gadjah Mada University in Central Java to promote research and innovation in the field of transportation. Members of the Indonesian public complained about the suspicious sale of investment products and the OJK (the Indonesian financial regulatory agency) added SkyWay Capital to its list of prohibited companies. As a result all negotiations in Indonesia were finally cancelled or postponed and the activities of the Indonesian subsidiary \\"PT SkyWay Technologies Indonesia\\" were frozen. =Italy= In early 2018 negotiations took place in Italy. The Secretary of State for the Republic of San Marino signed a Memorandum of Understanding at the EcoTechnoPark in Belarus in March 2018 for the construction of the San Marino-Rimini line. The mayor of the Sicilian city Messina also used SkyWay's \\"flying trams\\" to promote his electoral campaign. Both negotiations were postponed or cancelled because of concerns brought up in local politics and by the Italian regulatory agency Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (CONSOB). In March 2019, Brianza - a region in North-West Lombardy, Italy - invited SkyWay to present a feasibility project for a cable car between Cologno Monzese and Vimercate. Due to controversy surrounding the company these negotiations have been postponed. =United Arab Emirates= In October 2018 an investment agreement was signed between the SkyWay Group and Sharjah Research Technology and Innovation Park in the United Arab Emirates and 25 hectares was allocated to build a SkyWay test-site there. In February 2019 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) of Dubai with the \\"Skyway Greentech Company\\" to develop 'sky pods' there. In April 2019 the Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, approved a SkyWay suspended transit system that would have a length of 15 kilometres, consist of 21 stations and link vital spots in Dubai. In November 2019 the Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Member of the Federal Supreme Council of the UAE and Ruler of Sharjah, witnessed the launch of the experimental phase of the SkyWay project for a hanging track transport system at the Sharjah Research Technology and Innovation Park. Financial regulation Regulators in Belgium, Lithuania, and Estonia have warned investors about SkyWay not being authorized to issues shares in the respective countries. In 2018 The International Organization of Securities Commissions (OICV-IOSCO) released a number of warnings related to the activities of SkyWay Group companies such as \\"SkyWay Capital\\" and \\"Sky Way Invest Group\\". In February 2018 the Italian regulatory agency CONSOB prohibited the advertisement and sale of certain SkyWay investment products to Italian citizens. In May 2019 the German regulatory agency BaFin prohibited the public offering of SkyWay investment products to the general public. In August 2019 the Financial markets Authority (FMA) of the New Zealand reiterated warning about potential Skyway Capital/SWIG scam.  Criticism  Concerns have been raised in published articles about information the company has posted about itself to promote investment. These concerns include the unrealistic returns promised to investors, the value of its intellectual property, awards it has won, excessive pre-order contracts, and people/organisations who have invested in the company.

Northumberland was then a border county and in 1341, Sir Robert Ogle was allowed a licence to crenellate or fortify the manor; in 1346, David II of Scotland was held prisoner here after his capture at the Battle of Neville's Cross.Wallis, J.

The last direct descendant in the senior line, Catherine Ogle (ca 1568-1629), married Sir Charles Cavendish and after her death, the manor passed to their son, William Cavendish, later 1st Duke of Newcastle. Cavendish was the senior Royalist in the North during the 1642-1646 First English Civil War and spent much of his fortune raising troops for Charles I; after defeat at Marston Moor in 1644, he went into exile in Europe, returning only after the 1660 Restoration. Parliament sold Ogle Castle in 1653 to James Moseley, who repaired some of the damage done during the civil wars but the original house was extensively rebuilt after it was returned to William in 1660. The modern building largely dates from that period, retaining only the mediaeval tower house and its projecting latrine, as well as showing parts of a double moat on the western and northern sides.

If activated to federal service, the Wing is gained by the United States Air Force Air Mobility Command. Overview The 121st Air Refueling Wing's KC-135 Stratotanker mission is to provide the core aerial refueling capability for the U.S. Air Force and the Air National Guard. This unique aircraft enhances the Air Force's capability to accomplish its primary missions of Global Reach and Global Power. It also provides aerial refueling support to Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and allied nation aircraft. The KC-135 is capable of transporting litter and ambulatory patients using patient support pallets during aeromedical evacuations. Units The 121st Air Refueling Wing consists of the following units: * 121st Operations Group ** 166th Air Refueling Squadron * 121st Maintenance Group * 121st Mission Support Group * 121st Medical Group History=World War II : See 357th Fighter Group for extended World War II history Capt. Clarence E. \\"Bud\\" Anderson, 363d FS. Capt Anderson flew three P-51s (2 B and 1 D) which he named \\"Old Crow\\" (B6-S), this aircraft being P-51D 44-14450. Used P-39 Airacobras in preparing for duty overseas. Moved to England in November 1943 and became part of VIII Fighter Command. Trained with P-51 Mustangs and began combat operations on 11 February 1944 by making a fighter sweep over Rouen. Served primarily as a bomber escort organization, providing penetration (target) and withdrawal support for bombers that attacked strategic objectives on the Continent. Participated in the assault against the German Air Force and aircraft industry during Big Week, 20–25 February 1944. Received a Distinguished Unit Citation for two escort missions in which heavy opposition was encountered from enemy fighters: on 6 March 1944 provided target and withdrawal support during the first attack that heavy bombers of Eighth Air Force made on Berlin; on 29 June 1944 protected bombers that struck targets at Leipzig. Received second DUC for operations on 14 January 1945 when the group, covering bombers on a raid to Derben, broke up an attack by a large force of interceptors and in the ensuing aerial battle destroyed a number of the enemy planes. In addition to escort the group conducted counter-air patrols, made fighter sweeps, and flew strafing and dive-bombing missions in which it attacked airdromes, marshalling yards, locomotives, bridges, barges, tugboats, highways, vehicles, fuel dumps, and other targets. Participated in the invasion of Normandy in Jun 1944; the breakthrough at St Lo in July; the Battle of the Bulge, Dec 1944 – Jan 1945; and the airborne assault across the Rhine in Mar 1945. Flew its last mission, an escort operation, on 25 April 1945. Moved to Germany in Jul and assigned to United States Air Forces in Europe for duty with the army of occupation. Inactivated in Germany on 20 August 1946. Ohio Air National Guard 164th FS P-51H Mustang 44-64502 The wartime 357th Fighter Group was re-designated as the 121st Fighter Group, and was allotted to the Ohio Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Lockbourne Army Airfield, Columbus, Ohio, and was extended federal recognition on 20 June 1948 by the National Guard Bureau. The 121st Fighter Group was bestowed the lineage, history, honors, and colors of the 357th Fighter Group. Assigned to the Ohio ANG 55th Fighter Wing, the 121st Fighter Group consisted of the following operational squadrons: * 162d Fighter Squadron, Cox-Dayton Municipal Airport * 164th Fighter Squadron, Mansfield Lahm Regional Airport * 166th Fighter Squadron, Lockbourne Army Airfield The squadrons was equipped with F-51D Mustangs with a mission of air defense of the State of Ohio. On 31 October 1950 the 121st Fighter Wing was established, and the 55th Fighter Wing was disbanded, its personnel and mission assumed by the new 121st Fighter Wing. The 121st Fighter Groups and its assigned squadrons were assigned to the new 121st FW. With the assumption of the 55th Fighter Wing, the 112th Bombardment Squadron (Light) at Cleveland Municipal Airport was transferred from the 55th Fighter Wing to the 121st Fighter Wing, the squadron being assigned directly to the wing. The 112th flew the RB-26C Invader. =Korean War federalization= Douglas RB-26C-40-DT Invader serial 44-35599 of the 112th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron in a temporary wooden nose \\"hangar\\", January 1953. Notice the temporary Marston Mat used for the parking apron with the snow and ice. With the surprise invasion of South Korea on 25 June 1950, and the regular military's complete lack of readiness, most of the Air National Guard was federalized placed on active duty. * The 112th Bombardment Squadron was federalized on 10 October 1950. It was re-designated as the 112th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron and assigned to the federalized Alabama ANG 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Group. It deployed to West Germany and later France to reinforce the United States Air Forces in Europe. It was released from active duty on 9 July 1952 and returned to Ohio without aircraft or equipment, which was transferred to USAFE. * The 162d Fighter Squadron was not federalized and remained at Cox-Dayton Municipal Airport and continued its air defense mission. * The 164th Fighter Squadron was federalized on 10 February 1951. The 164th however was selected to remain at Mansfield Lahm Regional Airport and continue the air defense mission, being operationally gained by the Eastern Air Defense Force, Air Defense Command. The squadron was released from federal service and returned to Ohio State control. * The 166th Fighter Squadron was federalized on 10 February 1951 and assigned to the federalized Indiana ANG 122d Fighter-Interceptor Group with an Air Defense Command commitment. The squadron initially remained at Lockbourne and flew air defense training missions. On 20 September, the 166th was reassigned to the federalized Oregon ANG 142d Fighter-Interceptor Group which was headquartered at Chicago O'Hare International Airport with no change of mission. However, Strategic Air Command (SAC) had taken over Lockbourne AFB on 1 April 1951 it was decided to move the 166th FIS to Youngstown Municipal Airport, Ohio, which was accomplished on 31 October 1952. The squadron was released from federal service and returned to Ohio State control on 1 November, remaining in Youngstown. =Early Cold War era= F-84E Thunderjet from 1955–1957 The 112th was reformed at Akron-Canton Airport and re- designated as the 112th Fighter-Bomber Squadron. It was re-equipped with F-51H Mustangs, and were one of the last two Air National Guard squadrons to fly this version of the Mustang. It was assigned to the 121st Fighter-Bomber Group. At its new base at Youngstown, the 166th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was re-equipped with F-51H Mustangs which the squadron flew until 1954 when the 166th received refurbished F-80A Shooting Stars that had been modified and upgraded to F-80C standards. With the F-80s, the squadron began standing daytime air defense alert at Youngstown, placing two aircraft at the end of the runway with pilots in the cockpit from one hour before sunrise until one hour after sunset. The squadron only operated the Shooting Star until January 1955 when the 166th received F-84E Thunderjets that had returned from wartime duty in Korea. In September 1953 the 164th, now designated as a Fighter-Bomber Squadron, received its first jet aircraft, refurbished F-80A Shooting Stars that had been modified and upgraded to F-80C standards. The squadron only operated the Shooting Star for a year when in October 1954 the equipment was changed to F-84E Thunderjets that had returned from wartime duty in Korea. In August 1954, the 164th began standing daytime air defense alert at Mansfield, placing two aircraft at the end of the runway with pilots in the cockpit from one hour before sunrise until one hour after sunset. This ADC alert lasted each and every day until 30 June 1956. In September 1955 Air Defense Command wanted to re-equip the 162d Fighter Interceptor Squadron from F-51H Mustangs to jet-powered F-84E Thunderjets in accordance with the USAF directive to phase out propeller-driven fighter-interceptor aircraft from the inventory. However, because the runways at the Cox-Dayton Municipal Airport were too short at that time to support jet fighter operations, the National Guard Bureau approved the relocation request by the Ohio ANG to move the squadron to Springfield Municipal Airport, just east of Dayton. With new facilities under construction at Springfield, the 162d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron conducted their transition training from temporary facilities at Wright-Patterson AFB. The F-84E Thunderjets were Korean War veteran aircraft and the squadron received training in the equipment from the Ohio ANG 164th and 166th Tactical Fighter Squadrons. Two 164th TFS F-84F Thunderstreaks in formationm 51-9433 and 52-6938 In October 1955, the 112th FBS were informed that they were to receive F-84E Thunderjets, but since the runways at Akron-Canton Municipal Airport were deemed inadequate for jet operations, it was decided to construct an entirely new facility for them at the new Toledo Express Airport at Toledo. The 112th FBS left Akron-Canton for the Toledo Municipal Airport on 1 April 1956 and retired their F-51H Mustangs for T-28A Trojans, and operated F-84Es until the summer of 1958. In January 1959, the 112th's facility at the Toledo Express Airport and moved to the new facility. The T-28s were replaced with new F-84F Thunderstreaks the squadron was designated as a Tactical Fighter Squadron. In early 1956, a fifth squadron was gained by the 121st. The 145th Air Transport Squadron was allotted to the Ohio Air National Guard by the National Guard Bureau to replace the 112th Fighter-Bomber Squadron at Akron- Canton Airport. The 145th ATS, gained by the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) received federal recognition on 17 March 1956. Initially assigned C-46D Commando twin-engine propeller transports, the squadron was upgraded in 1958 to C-119J Flying Boxcar transports, fitted for aeromedical transport of personnel to medical facilities. In early 1957, the 164th FBS sent their war- weary F-84C Thunderjets to storage at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona and received new F-84F Thunderstreak swept-wing interceptors. Later in 1957, the 164th Fighter-Bomber Squadron received the 1st Air Force Flying Safety Award for three consecutive years of accident-free flying, an impressive accomplishment as in the previous three years the squadron had flown three different types of aircraft. The 166th was upgraded with new F-84F Thunderstreaks in November 1957, the gaining command of the squadron became Tactical Air Command (TAC), however, it remained attached to Air Defense Command in a secondary role. In 1959, the need for active duty Air Defense Command bases and regular Air Force fighter-interceptor operations were diminishing and the intent to scale back operations at Youngstown AFB was announced on 28 October 1959. The Ohio Air National Guard moved the 121st FBG back to Lockbourne Air Force Base on 1 March 1960. =1961 Berlin Crisis= Former Ohio 166th TFS Republic F-84F-40-RE Thunderstreak, Serial 52-6526. Today, this aircraft is on permanent exhibit at the Museum of the United States Air Force Wright- Patterson AFB, Ohio The 121st Tactical Fighter Wing were called to active duty for a period of twelve months on 1 October. When activated, the federalized wing consisted of three operational units, the 162d TFS at Springfield, the 164th TFS at Mansfield, and the 166th at Lockbourne. The 112th TFS at Toledo and the 145th ATS at Akron were temporally attached directly to Ohio ANG Headquarters at Columbus for the period of federalization. The mission of the activated 121st TFW was to reinforce the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), and deploy to Étain-Rouvres Air Base, France, a standby USAFE base. However, due to funding shortages, only 26 F-84F Thunderstreaks of 166th TFS were deployed to France, although several ground support units from the 162nd and 164th were also deployed. On 4 November the first ANG T-33 aircraft arrived at Etain, with the F-84s arriving on 16 November. In July 1962 the deployed Air National Guardsmen were no longer needed in Europe and the 7121st began to redeploy its personnel to Ohio. All the aircraft and support equipment, however, remained at Etain to equip a new wing being formed there, the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing. The last of the ANG personnel departed on 9 August 1962. =1962 reorganization= With the wing's return from France in 1962, the Ohio Air National Guard received authorization from the National Guard Bureau to expand its squadrons to groups. * This expansion had commenced in July 1961 when the 145th Air Transport Squadron was moved to Clinton County Air Force Base. The 145th ATS was realigned to Tactical Air Command and became a C-97 Stratotanker air refueling squadron. The runways at Akron could not support the large C-97 operation which forced a move to Clinton County AFB. The 160th Air Refueling Group received federal recognition on 8 July 1961. * The 178th Tactical Fighter Group received federal recognition on 15 October 1962 at Springfield. The 162d Tactical Fighter Squadron was transferred from the 121st TFG to become its operational squadron. * The 179th Tactical Fighter Group received federal recognition on 15 October 1962 at Mansfield. The 164th Tactical Fighter Squadron was transferred from the 121st TFG to become its operational squadron. * The 180th Tactical Fighter Group received federal recognition on 15 October 1962 at Toledo. The 112th Tactical Fighter Squadron was transferred from the 121st TFG to become its operational squadron. The 121st Tactical Fighter Group retained its 164th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Lockbourne AFB. =Vietnam War and late Cold War era= 162d Tactical Fighter Squadron – North American F-100F Super Sabre 56-3859 about 1975 In 1962, having left their Thunderstreaks in France, the 166th TFS at Lockbourne was re-equipped with F-100C Super Sabre fighter-bombers, which greatly enhanced its mission capabilities. In 1964, the 160th ARG participated in Operation Ready Go, the first all United States Air National Guard (ANG) non- stop deployment of fighter aircraft to Europe. In 1965, the KC-97Gs were upgraded to KC-97Ls with addition of jet engine pods mounted to the outboard wings. 1967 saw the beginning of Operation Creek Party, a continuous rotational mission flying from Rhein Main Air Base, West Germany, providing air refueling to United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) tactical aircraft. The success of this operation, which would continue until 1975, demonstrated the ability of the Air National Guard to perform significant day-to-day missions without being mobilized. It was taken over by the active-duty Strategic Air Command 7th Air Force. Along with the Kansas ANG F-100C 127th Tactical Fighter Squadron, the 166th TFS was federalized and deployed to Kunsan Air Base, South Korea. The federalized ANG squadrons were assigned as part of the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing. The squadrons flew deterrent air defense missions over South Korean airspace during the next year. During the deployment some pilots flew combat missions in South Vietnam while performing temporary assignments with other units. The performance of the ANG units at Kusan in 1968–69 suggested the prerequisites of effective air reserve programs and paved the way for adoption of the total force policy in 1970 which exists today. In 1971 the squadrons F-100Cs were retired and replaced by F-100D/F Super Sabres, being received from combat units in South Vietnam that were returning to the United States. 166th TFS A-7D 72–260 about 1979 In the spring of 1970, the 178th TFG's F-84F Thunderstreaks were sent to Davis-Monthan AFB for storage, the squadron receiving Vietnam War veteran F-100D/F Super Sabres. Concentration on the qualifications of aircrews, munitions load crews and the attainment of a C-3 combat readiness rating were the primary objectives for 1971. The group achieved C-3 on 30 August, a first for F-100D-equipped Air Guard units. January 1972 saw the squadron in extensive practice for their pending 9th Air Force Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI). The ORI was conducted in March and the 9th Air Force did not agree with the unit's C-3 rating. A retake was scheduled in June, with the 162d TFS coming away with the TAC-confirmed rating of C-1, the first F-100D squadron to achieve this feat. In 1971, the 180th TFG retired its Thunderstreaks and also converted to the F-100 Super Sabre. 164th Airlift Squadron C-130 Hercules In 1971, Clinton County Air Force Base was closed as a result of the Nixon Administration looking to save money because of the Vietnam War. As part of the moving out of units from Clinton County AFB, the 160th ARG was moved to Lockbourne Air Force Base near Columbus, Ohio. In February 1972, the 179th TGS also retired its Thunderstreaks and converted to the F-100 Super Sabre. The squadron flew the F-100s until the winter of 1976 when the 179th was transferred from Tactical Air Command to Military Airlift Command on 5 January. At this time, the unit converted to the C-130B Hercules and received a complement of eight aircraft. With the change of equipment, the unit was designated a Tactical Airlift Group. In 1974, under the \\"Total Force Policy\\", Guard and Reserve units began to receive newer aircraft and equipment in the 1970s. The 166th TFS began conversion to the A-7D Corsair II in December which brought with it additional missions. The 178th TFG received the A-7D in January 1978. The conversion from the F-100 to the A-7 was accomplished in less than three months, the fastest ever for an Air Force or Air National Guard unit. The 179th TFG converted to A-7D in the summer of 1979 In December 1974 Tactical Air Command transferred its air refueling units to Strategic Air Command. In 1975, the 160th ARG became the first Air National Guard unit to convert to the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker all jet tanker aircraft as part of SAC's Eighth Air Force. The group was the first ANG unit to perform the SAC 24-hour Alert mission and pass a SAC Operational Readiness Inspection in July 1976. During the 1980s the squadrons and groups of the 121st were frequently deployed, primarily to Europe during USAFE exercises. The \\"OH\\" tailcode of the wing was a frequent sight at bases in England, West Germany and other NATO air bases. In 1989, while deployed at Panama for a Coronet Cove deployment, 180th TFG A-7s were employed during Operation Just Cause. =1990 Gulf Crisis= 160th ARG KC-135 refuels two U.S. Navy Grumman F-14A Tomcat fighters from Fighter Squadron VF-74. In August 1990, the 160th Air Refueling Group was one of the first Air Guard units to deploy aircraft to the Middle East after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Aircraft, aircrews and support personnel began volunteer rotational Desert Shield deployments to a provisional Tanker Task Force at King Abdul Aziz Air Base, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (1709th ARS (P)). The 160th was called to active duty on 20 December 1990. Deployment began on 28 December and the 160th became part of three Provisional Air Refueling Wings at Al Banteen Air Base, Abu Dhabi (1712th ARS (P)), Al Dhafra Air Base, Dubai (1705th ARS (P)), and Jeddah. Additional personnel augmented a regional support base at Morón Air Base, Spain while others deployed to various bases to \\"backfill\\" for deployed active duty personnel. Aircraft and volunteer aircrews were heavily involved in \\"Air Bridge\\" refueling missions supporting deployment of combat forces to Southwest Asia. The 179th Airlift Group was active during Desert Shield/Storm providing airlift support throughout the Continental United States and Europe. Portions of the 179th were activated during Desert Shield/Storm and served in the US, Europe and Saudi Arabia. The 164th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 178th and 180th Tactical Fighter Groups did not deploy to Saudi Arabia in 1990 during Operation Desert Shield or Operation Desert Storm as the A-7Ds were considered a second-line aircraft. Ohio Air National Guard volunteers, however were deployed to CENTAF during the crisis and subsequent combat operations. =Post Cold War reorganization= After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990 and Operation Desert Storm, Air Force planners reorganized the major command structure and the organization of its units to reflect the new reality of the 1990s and also a smaller force after the end of the Cold War. 112th Fighter Squadron – General Dynamics F-16D Block 42F Fighting Falcon 89-2165 Strategic Air Command, Military Airlift Command and Tactical Air Command were all inactivated. In their place Air Combat Command and Air Mobility Command became the gaining commands for the Ohio Air National Guard units effective 1 June 1992. * The 160th Air Refueling Group became part of Air Combat Command. In 1991 it was upgraded to the more fuel-efficient KC-135R Stratotanker. * The 179th Airlift Group became part of Air Combat Command. In 1991 it was upgraded to the C-130H Hercules. * The A-7D Corsair II ground support fighters were retired in 1992 and 1993. The 178th and 180th TFG received F-16C Fighting Falcon fighters and became part of Air Combat Command. The 178th Fighter Group was the last United States military organization to fly the A-7D. * The 166th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Rickenbacker also retired its A-7Ds. It was realigned as a KC-135 air refueling squadron in 1993 as part of Air Combat Combat Command. The 121st also assumed Rickenbacker base support responsibilities. In October 1993, the 121st Air Refueling Wing was consolidated with the 160th Air Refueling Group which was inactivated in the process. With this consolidation, the 121st became a \\"Super Wing\\" by gaining the 145th Air Refueling Squadron. In October 1995, in accordance with the Air Force One Base-One Wing directive the 121st was relieved of its Geographically separated Groups as they were changed in status to Wings, reporting directly to the Ohio Air National Guard. The 178th Fighter Wing stood up on 1 October 1995; the 179th Airlift Wing on 11 October 1995 and the 180th Fighter Wing also on 11 October 1995. =Modern era= A 121st Air Refueling Wing KC-135 refueling a B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber Under the 121st ARW, the 166th and 145th Air Refueling Squadrons began flying from bases in southern France to support strike aircraft during Operation Deny Flight missions over the Balkans. The 121st was a fixture at Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, as well as Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia, supporting Operations Northern Watch and Operation Southern Watch, respectively, over Iraq. After the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, the 121st Air Refueling Wing launched into immediate action supporting armed aircraft over the United States during Operation Noble Eagle. The 121st ARW had the distinction of flying more missions than any other unit during this time. The 121st ARW has also deployed and participated in Operation Enduring Freedom over Afghanistan, as well as Operation Iraqi Freedom over Iraq. In addition to the combat deployments, the unit has also been very heavily tasked with airlift missions during national emergencies. Immediately following Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, the 121st ARW was one of the first units to send aircraft into Louisiana filled with supplies and troops. Similar missions were flown in September 2005, after Hurricane Rita. In 2010, the wing commander Brigadier General Thomas Botchie was forced to resign after allegations of cronyism, fraternization, inappropriate conduct, and sexual harassment were made against him by members of the wing and substantiated by an investigation. Witnesses stated that fraternization and unprofessional relationships within the wing were widespread and also included another senior officer, Colonel Stephen McMahon, the wing's operations group commander.Fontaine, Scott, \\"Report: Sexual relationships ‘rampant’ in wing\\", Military Times, 18 April 2011; Fontaine, Scott, \\"Report details 1-star’s inappropriate conduct\\", Military Times, 18 April 2011.

As a political philosophy Parity of esteem can be used to establish a theory to overcome inter-communal conflict. Promoters of the theory argue that \\"parity of esteem\\" \\"offers a language for negotiation of a post-conflict equilibrium\\". This negotiation begins with the communities recognising the stalemate of their position. Rather than continue trying to out-do each other, the communities should attempt to negotiate a peaceful coexistence in a shared physical space despite their cultural differences. \\"Parity of esteem\\" can be described as a post-Enlightenment theory as it differs drastically from classical liberal or Marxist rationalism and is contrary to 20th-century ideas of \\"self-determination\\" or the 19th-century idea of the nation-state. Many of these anticipated a \\"withering away of nationalism\\" once minorities were brought within the nation-state. These concepts are today the most dominant within contemporary political theory. As Ernest Gellner writes, \\"the idea that political boundaries must be congruent with ethnic ones, that rulers must not be ethnically distinguishable from the ruled now has a salience and authority which it has never possessed in the previous history of mankind\\". Where Enlightenment theories addressed issues of inter-communal conflict, it did so either by promoting \\"non-sectarianism\\" against \\"tribalism\\" (liberalism) or emphasising \\"class politics\\" against \\"bourgeois nationalism\\" (Marxism). Neither of these approaches recognised the traditions of belligerents in inter-communal conflicts. \\"Parity of esteem\\" on the other hand can accepts various nationalist traditions within one state. Interest in \\"parity of esteem\\" approaches emerged during the mid-1980s and accelerated following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Yugoslav wars of the early 1990s. It was recognised that while there were 184 independent states, there were more than 600 living language groups and more than 5,000 ethnic groups. Simply put, without enough geo-political space, slogans such as the Serb nationalist claim for \\"All Serbs in One State\\" were simply unworkable. Since the end of the 1990s, \\"Parity of esteem\\" is a core concept to the Northern Ireland peace process. Health care \\"Parity of Esteem for Mental Health\\" is an issue for many healthcare systems because of the pervasive stigma of mental illness. People with diagnosed mental illness die on average around 20 years earlier than those without such a diagnosis, some because of suicide, but mostly because of poorly treated physical illness. Mental illness has been assessed as constituting around a quarter of the disease burden in developed countries. There is much bigger treatment gap for mental illness than for physical illness. In the USA legislation was enacted in 2006 which attempted to achieve equality in health insurance coverage between surgical treatment and mental health treatments. In the UK Norman Lamb campaigned for mental health to be given parity of esteem with physical health. The Royal College of Psychiatrists proposed that parity of esteem should be defined as \\"Valuing mental health equally with physical health\\". In practice most arguments have been centred on levels of funding. Expenditure on mental health services provided by NHS trusts fell by around 8.25% between 2010 and 2015. According to Dr Phil Moore chair of the Mental Health Commissioners Network at NHS Clinical Commissioners discussions in 2016 had degenerated into a funding dispute. He wanted to see discussions about the degree to which mental health is embedded into other services, including the integration of psychological services with general practice  References  * Tom Hennessey and Robin Wilson, 1997, With All Due Respect: Pluralism and Parity of Esteem, Democratic Dialogue, Political theories Mental health Discrimination ","title":"Parity of esteem"},{"id":"9579593","text":"Bardowick is a Samtgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\") in the district of Lüneburg, in Lower Saxony, Germany.

In 1984 he became the last student in Eton's history to receive corporal punishment. Early writing career Doggart began his career as a journalist in Latin America, working as a reporter on the Lima Times during two years he took off before going to Cambridge. Within three months on the job, he was promoted to co-Editor of the newspaper. At 19, he was the youngest editor the paper had had. In 1990, he moved to Argentina, where he became Finance and Economics Editor for the Buenos Aires Herald, chronicling an extraordinary period of hyperinflation, wholescale privatizations, and deregulation under President Carlos Menem's neo-liberal government. Doggart parleyed his journalism work into a book, Investment Opportunities in Argentina, which had a foreword by Menem himself. Published in 1990, a month after he went to Cambridge, Doggart's own tutor, David Lehmann, reviewed the book in Professional Investor: \\"As the first optimistic economic report on Argentina to have been produced for some 20 years, this study acts as a clear indicator of the international business community's growing interest in the region.\\" Theatre career After leaving Cambridge, Doggart trained as a drama director at Central School of Speech and Drama. His production of Ms Lear—which radically re-interpreted King Lear as a neo-Thatcherite woman—performed at theatres in London and Amsterdam. On graduating, he directed productions for eminent British companies Cheek by Jowl (world tour of The Duchess of Malfi); Actors Touring Company (Ion by Euripides); Theatre Museum Covent Garden (Playing with Fire by August Strindberg) and Creation Theatre Company (Romeo and Juliet, which Doggart set in 18th century Ireland, with English Capulets and Irish Montagues). Doggart established himself as the leading translator/director of Latin American plays on the British stage. His production of Mistress of Desires, on which he collaborated directly with Nobel Laureate Mario Vargas Llosa, premiered in 1993. He worked directly with Carlos Fuentes on the British premiere of Orchids in the Moonlight, a dream play about the love between two Mexican actresses exiled in Hollywood's maze of mirrors. Doggart rehearsed the play in Cuba and opened in the Teatro Nacional, Havana. The production went on to perform at the Edinburgh Festival. According to Scotland on Sunday, the production was \\"rich in language and movement, fantasy and reality, sensuality and cruelty; as iconoclastic as the magic realist boom of the 1960s.\\" In 1994, Doggart translated and directed Night of the Assassins, by the Cuban author Jose Triana, staging it at the Technis theatre in London and at the Edinburgh Festival. According to The Scotsman: \\"Brilliant, at times almost unbearable to watch, the British premiere of this award-winning Cuban play is utterly compelling... The atmosphere of oppression is almost tangible as the audience feel themselves entangled in the hysteria and power games of three siblings enacting or re-enacting the murder of their parents.\\" In 1996, Doggart translated and directed a double bill of plays at The Gate theatre: Saying Yes, by Griselda Gambaro and Rappaccini's Daughter, by Nobel Laureate Octavio Paz, with whom he collaborated on the translation. Sarah Alexander played the leading role of Beatrice. That same translation has been staged internationally, including a production by the Santa Fe Playhouse in July 2006. Doggart has since translated the only plays of two other leading Latin American writers: Diatribe of Love against a sitting man, by Gabriel García Márquez, and The Kings by Julio Cortázar. In 1998, Doggart produced Northern Stage's 'Lorca Fiesta', a major festival in Newcastle upon Tyne to celebrate the centenary of the birth of Spanish poet Federico García Lorca. The event included an academic conference of international scholars and translators of Lorca and a dramatization of Lorca's Poet in New York, which Doggart adapted and directed. He was also producer and dramaturg for The Moon Comes Out, Federico, a collaboration between Northern Stage and the Seville-based company Octubre Danza, which fused story-telling, contemporary dance and live cante jondo to enact Lorca's long poem \\"Lament to Ignacio Sanchez Mejias\\". In 2000, Doggart co-founded the Gaia Arts Center in Havana, Cuba, dedicated to providing theater practitioners with a safe and inspiring place in which to create. In 2007, Doggart devised and co-directed the live performance piece, Balance of Ice, which combined three elements: a piece of music by Canadian composer Andrew Staniland that was inspired by the sounds of ice sheets calving; a dance performance by acclaimed Cuban ballerina Viengsay Valdes that fragmented her usual balletic virtuosity; and edited moving images of the polar ice caps and the threats facing them. Between 2007–2008, Doggart translated and directed Cocinando con Elvis, a Spanish version of Lee Hall's play Cooking with Elvis, about food, sex, happiness, and Elvis Presley. The production opened at the Teatro Nacional in Havana, and was the first premiere of a British play in Cuba since An Inspector Calls opened in 1947. Television career In 1999, Doggart branched into television production, where he produced and/or directed for the BBC (Tomorrow's World'); Channel Four (Living on the Line), and worked as an associate producer on ITV series (The South Bank Show and Two Thousand Years). The Financial Times wrote of Two Thousand Years: \\"Well made and highly informative, the first series truly to deserve the 'Millennium label'.\\" His interview profiles included Germaine Greer, Kenneth Branagh and Nobel prize-winning Octavio Paz. In 2000, Doggart moved to the United States where he produced/directed major TV series including: *Wife Swap for ABC and RDF Media, an Emmy-nominated show in which two families from vastly different social classes and lifestyles, swap wives/mothers for two weeks. Doggart's film, about a New Jersey woman who treated her plastic dolls as her own children and went to the Alabama countryside to live with a man whose favourite food was armadillo with ketchup, was described as \\"the strangest season premiere ever,\\" received an A+ critical rating, and clocked 3.57m viewers. *Project Runway for Bravo, described by The New York Times as \\"the Prada of reality shows\\", and nominated for a 2005 Primetime Emmy; *15 Films About Madonna for A&E; – a one-hour one- off film, notable because Doggart directed and co-wrote 15 short films of totally different genres: animation, documentary, drama, mock political campaign ads, mock infomercial, comedy, mock 1950s PSA, and music video. The film was chosen to represent Great Britain at the 2008 Muestra de Jovenes Realizadores in Havana, Cuba and played at the prestigious Cine Charles Chaplin. *Two series (15 episodes) of Damage Control (TV series) for MTV, directing celebrities including Kelly Clarkson and Hulk Hogan *30 Days for FX, hosted by Oscar-nominated Morgan Spurlock and nominated for a Producers Guild of America award *Things I Hate About You for Bravo, a show where spouses identified a number of irritating traits in their partner, and then revealed them on camera, so that a panel of relationship experts could vote which was the better partner. Film career Sebastian Doggart and Heidi Klum on set of 'Project Runway' After writing and directing two short fictional films, Hole in the Wall and Three and a Bed, Doggart set up Tribute Films, a company that produced films for individuals, their loved ones and their pets. His production of Carol Connors and Her Cats, launched a longstanding collaboration with Connors, a passionate ailurophile (cat lover), Elvis Presley's former girlfriend, and a twice-Oscar-nominated songwriter. The film was lauded by Charlene Tilton as \\"the funniest thing I have ever seen\\". The Los Angeles Times described it as the first pet hagiography film ever made, and as \\"the Cadillac of filmed pet memorials\\". In 2004, Doggart moved to New York City. From 2006, he spent three years making Courting Condi, the first musical docu-tragi-comedy in the history of cinema. The film won 26 awards on the festival circuit, screened at the Cannes Film Festival, and was critically acclaimed. By combining screenings of the film with public debates about its subject, Condoleezza Rice's record in office, Doggart fueled calls for Rice to be investigated for human rights abuses and war crimes. In 2009, Doggart directed and produced another film about Rice, American Faust: From Condi to Neo-Condi. This investigative documentary explored in greater depth Rice's pursuit and alleged misuse of power, and revealed the direct role she had in fabricating reasons for going to war in Iraq, and in ordering torture, especially in CIA black sites around the world. The film won numerous awards on the festival circuit, and was broadcast on a raft of international stations, including Al-Jazeera. In 2012, he completed a third feature film, True Bromance, an irreverent romantic comedy starring Jim Norton, Adrian Grenier, Frank Luntz, Devin Ratray and himself about the absurd role friends and family play when people fall in love. The film won 19 awards on the festival circuit, including Best Film at the Harlem International Film Festival, and Best Actor and Best Screenplay at the Washington DC International Film Festival. 'The Brooklyn Paper' described it as \\"a bromance for the ages.\\" ‘The Brooklyn Eagle’ wrote: \\"Starring possibly the most surreal comedy troupe ever... True Bromance is consistently unnerving, funny and surprising and features an original comic-book style\\". Doggart has written two other screenplays, Casanova's Return and Clinton a Neuro-Musical. Political and human rights career In 1997, Doggart was a campaign manager on Martin Bell's successful bid to become the first Independent MP to be elected to the British Parliament since 1945. From 2009-10, Doggart used the release of his documentary American Faust: From Condi to Neo-Condi to launch a campaign to bring to justice officials in the Bush Administration whom contributors in the film —- including attorneys from the American Civil Rights Union, Amnesty International and Reprieve—allege are guilty of war crimes and torture. Amnesty International screened the film at Stanford University on the eve of Rice's return to the Hoover Institution, adding to pressure on Stanford authorities to expel her for allegedly dishonoring the college's Fundamental Standard to show \\"respect for order, morality, personal honor and the rights of others as is demanded of good citizens.\\" Doggart teamed up with students at the University of Denver, where Rice was an undergraduate, by organizing a debate on the motion 'This house believes that Condoleezza Rice should stand trial for war crimes.' Proposing the motion was Rice's political theory professor, Alan Gilbert; defending Rice was Republican State Senator Sean Mitchell. The event met fierce resistance from the University administration. Vice Chancellor Jim Berscheidt had already tried to shut down a shoot and denied the producers access to archive of Josef Korbel. Up until the last moment, Berscheidt sought to use bureaucratic obstacles and alleged intimidation of students to stop the event. However, the screening and debate did eventually take place, with a strong turn-out, and webcast on both Mogulus television and through the Amnesty International website. At a screening at the Starz Denver film festival in December 2009, and again in an interview with Progressive Voice, Doggart called for the prosecution of ten Bush Administration officials: President George W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice (as NSA and chair of the Group of Principals who authorized the torture techniques), Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Vice-President Dick Cheney, CIA bosses George Tenet and Porter Goss, General Geoffrey D. Miller (commander at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo), Secretary of State Colin Powell, and Attorney Generals John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales. In February 2010, Doggart presented a screening of the film at New York's Revolution Books with human rights organizations World Can't Wait and War Criminals Watch. Screenings in Minnesota were also organized by Coleen Rowley, a former FBI agent turned whistle-blower, who called the film \\"a must-see documentary\\". The campaign continued through social networking sites and interviews in the press, radio and on PBS but has so far failed to secure its objective of Rice's arrest, prosecution and imprisonment. Efforts to this end were escalated in May 2010, following the announcement that Rice was to play a concert with Aretha Franklin. Doggart responded to this by corralling a group of human rights activists, including Rowley, War Criminals Watch, and Down With Tyranny, to pressure Franklin and the Philadelphia Orchestra to dump her from the concert billing, and to encourage either a citizen's arrest, or one instigated by Attorney General Eric Holder. These protests continued at a Denver University awards dinner, where Madeleine Albright presented the 2010 Josef Korbel Outstanding Alumni Award to Rice, while activists warned guests outside that \\"there's a war criminal in the area\\". In 2014 and 2015, Doggart was the chief judge on the annual Tackling Torture Video contest. In 2016, Doggart was appointed President of the New York Families Civil Liberties Union, and 2018 was made Executive Director of the national FCLU. Writing career Doggart has had three books published: Fire Blood and the Alphabet: One Hundred Years of Lorca focused on Spanish playwright and poet, Federico García Lorca. The book included poems, translations and an essay by Doggart, as well as eminent Lorca scholars, and was published in a second edition in January 2010. Stage Labyrinths: Latin American Plays included Doggart's translations of five Latin American dramatic works, as well as interviews with the writers and a history of Latin American theater His third book is on the Argentine economy. He has been a principal contributor to five other books – Stages of Conflict: A critical anthology of Latin American theater and Performance (University of Michigan Press, 2008), Purple Homicide: Fear and Loathing on Knutsford Heath (Bloomsbury, 1998), Raymond Chandler: A Biography (Atlantic, 1997), Reflections in a Family Mirror (Red House, 2002), and Time Out: Havana (Penguin, 2001, 2005, 2007) – and has written for New Statesman, The Guardian, The Independent, The Observer, The Telegraph, The Huffington Post and The Sunday Telegraph. In 2011, Doggart became a columnist for The Daily Telegraph, writing a twice-monthly column from New York on film, literary, political, family and comedic subjects. column. He also worked as a film reviewer for The Guardian . .

It was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers by damming the East Branch of the Clarion River. Construction of the rolled earth, impervious core dam was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1944. The lake is one of sixteen flood control projects administered by the Pittsburgh District of the Army Corps of Engineers. East Branch Clarion River Lake helps to provide flood protection for the Clarion River valley and the lower portions of the Allegheny River and the upper portions of the Ohio River. The dam is upstream from the confluence of the East and West branches of the Clarion River. It was constructed in 1952 for $9 million and serves a 72.4 mi² (187 km²) drainage area. It is estimated that East Branch Clarion River Lake has prevented $81 million in damage. The dam was especially important in curtailing damage during the 1972 floods caused by Hurricane Agnes. East Branch Clarion River Lake also serves recreational purposes. Controlled releases of water during the dry summer months help to improve water quality and quantity for industrial and domestic uses. These releases of the lake waters also improve navigation on the rivers and enhance aquatic life. An August 2013 bass catch and release tournament held at the East Branch Clarion River Lake by the Reynoldsville Bass Club East Branch Clarion River Lake is a destination for both fisherman and recreational boaters. The lake is home to cold water fishing for walleye, smallmouth bass, muskellunge, brook, lake, rainbow and brown trout. The creeks of the park are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. There is a native brook trout population in some of the smaller streams of the park. There is no limit on the horsepower of the boats. All boats are required to have current registration with any state. Ice fishing and ice boating are common winter activities on East Branch Clarion River Lake. The land in the vicinity of the dam is managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

The branch allows Norfolk Southern, since the opening of a new bridge in 2001, to bypass the city of Wilmington, Delaware and allows direct access to both the Port of Wilmington and the New Castle Secondary, which connects to the Delmarva Subdivision of the Delmarva Central Railroad that runs to Central Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia's Eastern Shore. Both ends of the branch connect with Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and, like all of the PRR's through- freight lines, was electrified from 1935 PRR Eastern Region Electric Power System, Drawing ET-1, dated June 10, 1935 Retrieved November 10, 2010 until the Conrail era. The line was originally built doubly tracked, but was subsequently converted to single track.  Route description  The line begins at its northern terminus at the Bell Interlocking PRR Ward and Bridge interlocking diagrams, dated Jan 1, 1962 Retrieved December 26, 2010. near Claymont, Delaware, a flying junction built by the former Pennsylvania Railroad originally to allow thru-freight traffic access to the double-track Shellpot Branch from the four-track Philadelphia-Washington Mainline without crossing over any of the passenger-only tracks. Consisting of a single grade- separated overpass bridge used by northbound NEC (that is, Amtrak intercity and Wilmington/Newark Line commuter trains (southbound trains remain at ground level)), the two inner tracks which become the Shellpot Branch duck underneath of the bridge and comes level with the two passenger tracks at the Bellevue Substation , which converts the 138 kV, 25 Hz AC transmission power to the 11 kV, 25 Hz AC traction power used on the overhead catenary used by the Amtrak and SEPTA trains. See also Amtrak's 25 Hz Traction Power System. South of Bellevue, the two electrified tracks reduce to a single track, but less than a mile after the reduction, a non-electrified track that becomes the Shellpot Branch splits back off the electrified single track that eventually goes into Amtrak's Wilmington Maintenance Facility . An additional non-electrified track which serves the former Chemours Edgemoor freight siding splits off from the NEC at the Interstate 495 underpass. Just after the divergence from the NEC right-of-way, the line enters the NS Edgemoor Yard facility. The line parallels I-495 and passes under 12th Street, then crosses over the Christina River on a single-track turntable bridge that was rebuilt in 2001 . Past the bridge, the New Castle Secondary (which connects to the Delmarva Secondary and the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision at Porter, DE) splits off at a wye junction , also built in 2001 with the bridge, allowing both eastbound and westbound trains to access the line without having to go through Wilmington (which would only be allowed during overnight hours) and then reversing direction in Newport. The Shellpot Branch ends with the line rejoining the NEC at the line's Ragan interlocking near Interstate 95 in Newport, Delaware. Christina River bridges  The Shellpot branch features two separate swing bridges crossing the winding Christina River at different locations. The first bridge, \\"Bridge\\" or No. 3 Drawbridge, located 3.77 miles from Bellevue Tower, had become a dilapidated two-track structure that forced Conrail, due to budgetary restrictions, to abandon the bridge and restructure Shellpot Branch operations in the mid-1990s. For nearly ten years the bridge sat idle. A novel public-private partnership between Conrail's successor, Norfolk Southern, and the state of Delaware resulted in the state providing capital (about $13 million) to rebuild the bridge. In return, the bridge became a toll bridge for twenty years, with NS paying the state a fee for each car transported over the bridge.Zeta-Tech presentation Retrieved December 26, 2010. Due to the historic nature of the bridge, the movable span was removed and refurbished. The approach piers were replaced. Although the bridge has the width to accommodate two tracks, it was rebuilt with the single track structure centered within the bridge structure. The second bridge, \\"Ward\\" or No. 4 Drawbridge, is located 5.22 miles from Bellevue, and has not required rebuilding. However, it is out of service to water traffic, as the bridge's control shack and interlocking signals have been removed, the central fender is overgrown with trees, and the Christina's navigable channel now stops just short of this bridge. The operator of \\"Ward\\" bridge also controlled an adjacent swing bridge which carried a former Reading and Baltimore and Ohio Railroad branch to Pigeon Point on the Delaware River, which crossed the Shellpot Branch on a diamond. The Reading branch was abandoned after Conrail was formed in 1976 and its bridge has been left in the open position ever since.

It is a useful tool for ranking projects because it allows you to quantify the amount of value created per unit of investment. Under capital rationing, PI method is suitable because PI method indicates relative figure i.e. ratio instead of absolute figure. The ratio is calculated as follows: *\\\\text{Profitability index} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{PV of future cash flows}}{\\\\text{Initial investment}} = 1 + \\\\frac{\\\\text{NPV}}{\\\\text{Initial investment}} Assuming that the cash flow calculated does not include the investment made in the project, a profitability index of 1 indicates break- even. Any value lower than one would indicate that the project's present value (PV) is less than the initial investment. As the value of the profitability index increases, so does the financial attractiveness of the proposed project. The PI is similar to the Return on Investment (ROI), except that the net profit is discounted.

It was directed by Tom Gries with a screenplay by James R. Webb. The cast included Charlton Heston as Whipple Hoxworth and Geraldine Chaplin. The performance by Tina Chen led to her receiving a Golden Globe nomination as best supporting actress. The film was based on the book's later chapters, which covered the arrival of the Chinese and Japanese and the growth of the plantations. The third chapter of the book had been made into the film Hawaii in 1966. Plot The story begins 40 years after the events depicted in the original Hawaii as a new generation of Americans and Asians must deal with a changing island and world. One of them is a sea captain. Whipple \\"Whip\\" Hoxworth returns home to Hawaii to find his grandfather (Captain Rafer Hoxworth in the preceding film) has died and left his fortune to Hoxworth's cousin, Micah Hale. Whip, the black sheep of his otherwise very conservative and disapproving family, starts a plantation, staffing it with newly arrived Chinese indentured servants Mun Ki, and his second wife/concubine Nyuk Tsin. Mun Ki fathers children with Nyuk Tsin, all the while dreaming of returning to China and his first and officially \\"real\\" wife. Nyuk Tsin has other ideas. For the remainder of the story she is referred to as \\"Wu Chow's Auntie\\". Wu Chow is their firstborn son, and the nickname serves to support the traditional fiction that Mun Ki's official spouse in China is the \\"real\\" mother of his children. Whip steals valuable pineapples from French Guiana in the hope that they will grow in Hawaii. He gives the forlorn plants to Wu Chow's Auntie, knowing that she has a \\"green thumb\\". When she succeeds in nurturing the plants into flourishing, the overjoyed Whip offers to buy her some land as a reward. Over Mun Ki's opposition, she accepts. This is the first step in the rise of both Whip and Wu Chow's Auntie, as well as of the pineapple industry in Hawaii. Meanwhile, Whip marries native Hawaiian, Purity, and has a son with her. However, because of her inbred royal Hawaiian ancestry, she is mentally fragile. Eventually, her mind gives way, and she can no longer abide to live with Whip. Their son Noel grows to manhood experiencing an uneasy relationship with his father. When Mun Ki contracts leprosy, Wu Chow's Auntie accompanies him to the leper colony on Molokai. Upon Mun Ki's death years later, she returns to be reunited and reacquainted with her now-grown, educated, and prospering children. A complication arises when Noel falls in love with Wu Chow's Auntie's only daughter. Neither parent approves of the marriage, but in the end, they grudgingly accept it. Reception The movie opened to mixed reviews, with many critics feeling it was not as successful as the earlier movie Hawaii (1966), which was liked by both moviegoers and critics. It made less money than the original. Writing for The New York Times, Roger Greenspun called it a \\"movie with reasonable claims to having something for almost everybody\\", with \\"spectacle\\" that proceeds with \\"efficient and attractive modesty\\"; he complimented the director's craftsmanship and highlighted the performances of John Phillip Law and Charlton Heston, but said \\"Geraldine Chaplin offers only a disturbing evocation of her father's face, without the other qualities of his presence.\\" He calls Tina Chen \\"not remarkable\\", even though she has a \\"role almost equal to Heston's\\". Time magazine was even less complimentary, saying \\"the plot is laced with the usual colonial tensions and pretensions: Hoxworth feuds with a polyglut of races while his pineapple princess (Geraldine Chaplin) goes quietly mad. Every time the pace slackens, which is often, someone goes to sea, either to pick up field hands or to transport lepers to Molokai. The incessant ebb and flow is intended as a metaphor for the turbulent tides of Hawaiian life. But the real metaphor here is the pineapple, which in the good old gangster days was a synonym for bomb. Tina Chen received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Bill Thomas was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design.

He was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1929 to 1931, and 1940 to 1955. He was born, of Irish descent, in Grenada, West Indies and came to the United Kingdom to study medicine at Glasgow University in 1904. while at University he was active in the Fabian Society and founded the students' Irish Nationalist Club. After qualifying, he worked in a number of Glasgow mental hospitals and then served as a doctor in France during World War I, and then entered general practice in London, initially at Greenwich, later Camberwell and finally at Paddington. Political career Spanish Medical Aid armband Morgan contested the South London constituency of the Camberwell North West at the 1922 general election, but lost by a wide margin to the National Liberal MP Thomas James Macnamara. He stood again at the 1923 election, when Macnamara had re-joined the Liberal Party, and lost by only 80 votes. In 1924, Sir Edward Taswell Campbel won the seat by only 194 votes, and Morgan finally won the seat at the 1929 general election. However, the Labour Party split at the 1931 general election over fiscal policy; Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald had left the party to form a National Government with the support of the Conservative Party and some Liberals, and Labour's national share of the vote fell disastrously from 37% to 31%. In most seats, Liberal and Conservative candidates agreed a single candidate to stand against Labour, and as a result Labour retained only 52 of the 287 seats which it had won in 1929. Morgan's Camberwell seat was one of those lost. He did not stand for Parliament again until 1940, when the Labour MP William Kelly resigned his Rochdale seat. At the by-election in July 1940, Morgan was elected unopposed. He was re-elected in 1945, but with a majority of only 10%, he moved at the 1950 general election to the safer Warrington seat, which he won with a comfortable 19% majority. He was re-elected in Warrington in 1951 (when the Conservatives won Rochdale), and retired from the British House of Commons at the 1955 general election. In between his periods in Parliament, Morgan returned to medical practice. In 1936 he worked with Charles Brook and other members of the Labour-affiliated Socialist Medical Association to found the Spanish Medical Aid Committee, to provide supplies and a uniformed medical unit to the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. He served as a member of the Confederation of Health Service Employees (COHSE) union National Executive Committee and COHSE's Medical Guild from 1946–1951. Morgan died in 1956, aged 70.

Although his Hebrew name was יצחק (Isaac), he was known as \\"Arthur\\" in the secular world. He was married to Marguerite (Rebecca - רבקה) Pereyre, née Léon (1873 – 1968). The main accomplishment for which Pereyre is remembered by history is his writing out phonetically, according to modern French phonetics, the transliteration of the Mahzor (holiday prayerbook) of the Jewish community of Bayonne and Bordeaux. He wrote out this transliteration for the benefit of his wife, in the early years of the twentieth century. The Jewish communities of Bayonne and Bordeaux were founded by ex-conversos, Sephardi Jews who had pretended to convert to Catholicism, yet secretly continued keeping their Jewish traditions. The communities had a special way of pronouncing Hebrew, which retained numerous archaic features lost elsewhere. Although the synagogues still exist today, they have been taken over by North African Jews. The old ex-converso community has now dwindled to a few individuals. Thus, Pereyre's transliteration is invaluable in teaching linguists how the Hebrew pronunciation of the old community sounded. Prof. Moshe Bar-Asher transcribed and published Pereyre's transliterated Mahzor along with a study of the pronunciation as reflected in it. Arthur Pereyre is also credited for having copied a manuscript containing a Spanish translation of some haftarot, where the masoretic accents (the teamim) are written on the Spanish text itself, indicating to the reader the way to read and to chant it. This manuscript, discovered in 2014 by Peter Nahon, is believed to be the only non-Hebrew text bearing a punctuation system close to that of the Hebrew Bible.

Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States, Bangladesh, and Eastern India, but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere's summer and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across Europe, Asia, and Australia. Tornadic events are often accompanied with other forms of severe weather, including strong thunderstorms, strong winds, and hail. There were 1,395 tornadoes reported in the United States in 2003, of which 1,374 were confirmed. 2003 is currently the seventh-most active year for tornadoes in the United States since reliable record-keeping began in 1950. Events http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/2003/table January January had no tornadoes confirmed in the United States. It was only the fifth time since 1950 that an entire calendar month went tornado-free. The other months were; October 1952, December 1963, November 1976, and January 1986. February There were 18 tornadoes confirmed in the US in February. February 2 (Africa) A tornado killed 17 people near the town of Yumbi in the northwestern Bandundu Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Over 4,000 people were injured, 217 seriously. February 17–18 (Pakistan) On the 17th, a tornado killed five people and injured 35 in Gadap Town, Pakistan. More than 80 structures were destroyed, and many livestock were killed as well. Another tornado struck the next day near Lahore in eastern Pakistan, killing two people and injuring 150. 400 homes were destroyed in four villages. February 21–22 A rare winter storm caused eight tornadoes. At 3:13 PM, an F1 tornado touched down in the rugged rural hills of extreme western Breathitt County, Kentucky, near Athol. Two people were killed as five trailers were destroyed, and many damaged. March There were 43 tornadoes confirmed in March. March 17–20 A tornado outbreak produced 27 tornadoes from Texas to Georgia. During a three-day period from the 17th to the 19th, 22 F1 and F0 tornadoes touched down across a widespread area, mostly in Oklahoma, Louisiana, Alabama, and Tennessee. On the 19th, an F1 tornado near Cookeville, Tennessee killed one person when a trailer was thrown 100 yards. The tornado damaged houses, barns, trailers, garages, sheds, and at least one church. Many trees were downed as well. Another F1 tornado damaged three mobile homes, 11 homes and four businesses from the Rosalie to Flat Rock communities in Alabama. The final day of the outbreak was the most devastating. On the evening of the 20th, a supercell thunderstorm developed in the Florida Panhandle, producing an F2 tornado that struck Cypress. Two mobile homes and a single-family home were destroyed. 15 single-family and mobile homes were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were downed. One person was seriously injured and two sustained minor injuries in the Cypress area. The supercell continued into Georgia and produced an F3 tornado. The tornado tore through Mitchell County impacting subdivisions on the south side of Camilla. Unbelievably, another F3 tornado followed nearly this same track back in February 2000. Some residents in Camilla rebuilt homes destroyed by the tornado three years ago, only to find their new homes damaged or destroyed by this tornado. The tornado destroyed a total 66 homes, and damaged 200 homes and businesses, with the hardest hit area being the Goodson Road area of Camilla. The tornado then continued into Worth County, producing more damage before dissipating. Six people were killed and 200 were injured. Both Mitchell and Worth Counties declared a state of emergency as a result of the tornadoes. Numerous trees and power lines were downed as well. Overall, the outbreak caused seven fatalities. March 27 Eight tornadoes struck South Florida, including an F2 tornado that struck the Liberty City neighborhood of Miami and caused one death and 14 injuries. The fatality was the first tornado-related death in Miami-Dade County since 1925. As a result of that tornado, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dispersed over $8.4 million in funds. Additionally, an F1 tornado struck North Miami Beach and caused damage to trees and roofs, but no injuries were reported. April There were 156 tornadoes reported in April. April 4–7 A tornado outbreak spawned 41 tornadoes from Idaho to Alabama. There were no fatalities, but 14 people were injured. April 15 A small tornado outbreak struck Oklahoma and Texas, injuring one. May There were 542 tornadoes confirmed in May. May 3–11 North Kansas City tornado An intense series of tornado outbreaks occurred from May 3 to May 11. Tornadoes began occurring over the affected area on April 30, but the most prolific continuous period was the seven-day period of May 4–10. There were 401 tornado confirmed in 19 states and one Canadian province, 1,587 reports of large hail, and 740 reports of wind damage. More severe weather broke out this week alone than any other week in U.S. history, though comparable events occurred in May 1896, 1917, 1930, and 1949 before the modern era of tornado detection. There was a severe weather outbreak every day during the week. There were 48 people killed by the tornadoes, and damages totaled nearly $1 billion. Also six F4s touched down. The main meteorological factor for this series of tornado outbreaks was the presence of a persistent 500 mb trough over the western United States, coupled with a series of shortwave disturbances which propagated through the central and eastern United States. These shortwaves provided a mechanism for the deepening of surface low pressure areas, which followed the upper level flow from southwest to northeast. The cyclones induced a strong south to southeasterly flow in the low levels of the atmosphere (1000 mb, 850 mb) off the Gulf of Mexico. This persistent flow provided an abundance of warm, moist maritime tropical air in the central and eastern US. May 4 (Bangladesh) At least 20 people were killed by a tornado in several remote villages in the Brahmanbaria District of Bangladesh.Tornado hits Bangladesh Accessed 2009-01-25. May 18 (Australia) An F2 tornado struck Bendigo, Victoria, Australia, damaging more than 50 houses on a 7 km path.Severe Thunderstorms and Tornadoes in Victoria Retrieved 06 April 2007. June There were 292 tornadoes confirmed in the US in June. June 22–23 Supercell 22 June 2003 Hail between the size of softballs and volleyballs fell in Aurora, Nebraska on June 22 along with another storm to the East that produced a tornado. One person died and seven people were injured from a F2 tornado and another died the next night due to a F4 tornado. One of the largest hailstones ever measured fell, 17.8 cm (7.0 in) in diameter with a 47.6 cm (18.75 in) circumference. 27 tornadoes were confirmed, with all seven injuries and both deaths coming from Nebraska. June 24 A large tornado outbreak struck the Northern Plains. The strongest tornado was a large F4 tornado touched down near Huron, South Dakota ripping through the rural farmland before completely annihilating the town of Manchester. Four people were injured and Manchester later became a ghost town. Despite 95 tornadoes touching down during the outbreak, there were no fatalities, although 12 people were injured. July There were 167 tornadoes in July. July 21 A significant tornado and derecho event affected the northeastern United States. The event began with four weak F0 tornadoes in Indiana. Around 3:20 pm, an F1 tornado touched down in Pennsylvania and struck Kinzua Bridge State Park, destroying the 103-year- old Kinzua Bridge. Many trees were downed throughout the park. At about 7:30 pm, a long tracked supercell thunderstorm spawned a series of tornadoes along a path of 61 miles through New York and Vermont. It produced an F2 that had multiple vortices at one point, and at its strongest near Kinderhook Lake, New York produced considerable damage. A barn was completely destroyed and its contents thrown into Kinderhook Lake. A car was flipped, one person was injured, and trees were snapped as well. Another F2 tornado near Catskill, New York destroyed several homes and injured 7 people. One woman was injured in a mobile home as it was lifted into the air then smashed into the ground. Additional weak tornadoes and wind damage occurred in Vermont. The most powerful tornado of the day was an F3 that struck near the town of Ellisburg, Pennsylvania, where a farm was completely leveled. Another home was extensively damaged, and a car was thrown 600 yards. A tractor was lofted into a stand of trees as well. Widespread derecho damage occurred as well throughout the region. The derecho itself produced a very intense mesoscale convective vortex, and at times, the entire squall line was wrapped into it, creating a \\"Super-Derecho\\", also known as a Landphoon. Overall, the outbreak produced 26 tornadoes.http://www.erh.noaa.gov/ctp/features/2003/Severe721.php August There were 44 tornadoes confirmed in August. August 7  There were four reported tornadoes, including an F1 tornado in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. This tornado caused minor damage. September There were 32 tornadoes confirmed in September. September 23 An F1 tornado hit Ewing and Lawrence townships, in Mercer County, New Jersey. There were no fatalities, but there was widespread damage to homes.Tornado damages homes and power lines in Lawrence Twp. , The Daily Princetonian, September 24, 2003 The tornado touched down in Ewing near Prospect Street, crossed Olden Avenue, and entered Lawrence Township near the Shabukunk Creek. In Lawrenceville, the tornado followed a path parallel to and slightly northwest of Princeton Pike. Olden Avenue in Ewing was closed for several days while debris and downed power poles were removed. Several retail stores at the Mercer Mall and the Nassau Park retail center were also damaged.NCDC: Event Details October There were 26 tornadoes confirmed in October. October 29 An F0 tornado struck suburban Miami Gardens, Florida. No deaths or injuries were reported, and damage was relatively minor; damage to fencing and landscaping, roof damage to a trailer, and destruction of a patio and carport. The widely scattered nature of the damage supported the F0 classification. November There were 53 tornadoes confirmed in November. November 17–18 On November 17, the Storm Prediction Center forecast a moderate risk of severe thunderstorms for much of the Deep South from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast as an upper-level low ran into very unstable air. During the evening hours, numerous tornadoes broke out across portions of Southeast Texas and Central Louisiana, resulting in 56 injuries. Most of these tornadoes were weak, but five of them reached F2 intensity. Damage from this tornado outbreak totaled $9.934 million. November 26–27 During the late evening hours of November 26 (the night before Thanksgiving), severe weather broke out across portions of West-Central Louisiana. The worst storm spawned an F2 tornado, which formed in Beauregard Parish and traveled northeast into Vernon Parish. December There was one tornado confirmed in July. December 15 (Argentina) F3 tornado or an F2 cause destruction in the small town of Atalaya, in the province of Corrientes, in eastern Argentina. dozens of homes and cars destroyed and animals flew through the action of the tornado, had a path of 1 km. long and caused 5 killed and 50 wounded. December 21 (Australia) A minor tornado hit near Inverleigh, Victoria, Australia, causing severe damage to a farm. December 23 (Argentina) In the south of the city of Cordoba, the second largest city in Argentina an F3 tornado that devastated a neighborhood in just minutes was formed. 400 houses, dozens of cars and 1000 trees were damaged or destroyed in this tornado, which lasted for 25 minutes and swept through three neighborhoods, making it the longest lived tornado in the Southern Hemisphere. It was filmed by televtision cameras and by many people on the ground. The tornado caused five deaths and 90 wounded.

David M. Cheney. Retrieved October 7, 2016. \\"Diocese of Faenza-Modigliana\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved October 7, 2016. It was created in 1986 through a merger of the diocese of Faenza and the diocese of Modigliana. Originally the diocese of Faenza (Faventia) was a suffragan (subordinate) of the Archbishop of Ravenna.Kehr, p. 147. In 1582 the diocese of Bologna was raised to the status of a metropolitan archbishopric by Pope Gregory XIII in the bull Universi orbis of 10 December 1582, and Faenza was made a suffragan of the archdiocese of Bologna. On 2 April 1787, Pope Pius VI transferred seven parishes from the jurisdiction of the bishop of Faenza to the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Ravenna. On 7 July 1850, in the bull Ea quo licet immerito, Pope Pius IX created the new diocese of Modigliana from eight parishes in the territory of the diocese of Faenza.Cappelletti, Volume 17, pp. 349-354. This action was done at the repeated request of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Leopold II, whose political domain included the lands that became the diocese of Modigliana. The Duke was unhappy to see persons under his temporal jurisdiction subject to an ecclesiastical authority (Faenza) which was outside of his domain. The new diocese was assigned to the ecclesiastical province of Florence, and the Collegiate Church of S. Stefano de Mutilano became a cathedral. In 1853, when its first bishop was appointed, Modigliana was transferred to the ecclesiastical province of Bologna.Kehr, p. 147. Ruggero Bovelli was appointed bishop of Modigliana on 5 August 1915, and when a vacancy occurred in the diocese of Faenza, he was also appointed Bishop of Faenza, on 24 March 1924, and on 1 May the decree was issued uniting the two dioceses in the person of Bishop Bovelli.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 16 (Città del Vaticano 1924), p. 301 : 1 maii. — Cathedrali Ecclesiae Mutilanae, cum Ecclesia cathedrali Faventina ad personam unitae, E.

In compliance with a Constitution of the Second Vatican Council, and following norms established by Pope John XXIII, after extensive consultations with all interested parties, and with the consent of Pope John Paul II, the Vatican Congregation of Bishops issued a decree on 30 September 1986, uniting the two dioceses of Faenza and Modigliana under one bishop, with one Curia, and with one seat, and one Cathedral Chapter, in Faenza. The former cathedral of Modigliana was reduced to the rank of co-cathedral, and was allowed to keep its Chapter of Canons.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 79 (Città del Vaticano 1987), pp. 704-707: Vi criterii generalis, quo statuitur ut in unum coalescant circumscriptiones ecclesiasticae usque adhuc pastorali curae unius Episcopi commissae, etiam pro dioecesibus unitis Faventina et Mutilensi Congregatio pro Episcopis praesenti Decreto plenam earum unionem decernit. History In 740, according to the Chronicon of Canon Tolosanus of Faenza,Giuseppe Rossini (ed.), Magistri Tolosani Chronicon Faventinum Rerum Italicarum Scriptoresl Tomo XXVIII, pars 1 (Bologna: Nicola Zanichelli 1900), p. 6: Sub anno itaque dominice incarnationis DCC quadragesimo, parato exercitu magno, nominatus' rex maximis itineribu8 et occultis festinavit venire Favenciam, et sabbato sancto circa horam vespertinam pater per portam Emiliam, que dicitur Ymolensis, filius per Flamineam portam, que est super fluvium, in civitatem subito intraverunt, omnes viros et mulieres senes cum iunioribus, quos invenerunt, in ore gladii perimentes. Populus totus tunc aderat prò pueris baptizandis apud Sanctam Mariam foris portam, ubi sedis erat ep[iscopalis et unde] episcopatus delatus est in ecclesiam Sancti Petri intra civitatem' iubente Romano pontifice... Ex populo nempe pauci evaserunt, omnibus aliis interfectis seu vinculìs mancipatis.... the Lombard King Liutprand descended upon Faenza and put the town under siege. He was intent on seizing the Exarchate of Ravenna and expelling the last remaining Byzantine officials from northern Italy. Pope Gregory III, who was supporting the Exarch, and the people of Faenza who were supporting the Pope, were the object of the King's wrath. On Holy Saturday, in the evening, they broke into the Cathedral, where the annual solemn baptismal service was in progress, and killed or threw into chains nearly the entire population. The name and the fate of the bishop of Faenza are unknown.Righi, Annali, pp. 23-24. Cappelletti, p. 245. Pope Gregory wrote immediately to Charles Martel, complaining of the destruction and depredations of the Lombard kings, and seeking aid of the Franks. Either Gregory or his successor Zacharias (Gregory died in November 741) ordered the bishop of Faenza to move his episcopal seat from S. Maria foris portam ('outside the gate'), where the outrage had taken place, to the church of S. Peter inside the city.Rossini, Magistri Tolosani Chronicon Faventinum, p. 6, note 1. Cathedral and Chapter In 816, the Emperor Louis the Pious held a council at Aix, at which it was ordered that Canons and Canonesses live together according to a set of rules (canons, regulae). In the Roman synod of Pope Eugene II of November 826, it was ordered that Canons live together in a cloister next to the church. In 876, the Council of Pavia decreed in Canon X that the bishops should enclose the Canons: uti episcopi in civitatibus suis proximum ecclesiae claustrum instituant, in quo ipsi cum clero secundum canonicam regulam Deo militent, et sacerdotes suos ad hoc constringant, ut ecclesiam non relinquant et alibi habitare praesumant. 'Bishops are to create a cloister next to their church, in which they serve God along with their clergy according to the rule of canons, and they should compel their priests not to leave the church and presume to live elsewhere.' The office of Archdeacon is older than the Chapter of Canons, being attested as early as 883.Strocchi, p. 70. In 1045 the dignities of Archdeacon and Provost are found combined in one person.Tonduzzi, pp. 153, 155. But, after 1179, there is no mention of the Archdeacon, until the office was restored on 14 May 1517 by Pope Leo X.Strocchi, p. 71. According to tradition, the Canons and Canonry at Faenza were established by Bishop Paulus, a figure of the mid-tenth century. In 1045, according to the Chronicon of Canon Tolosanus of Faenza,Giuseppe Rossini (ed.), Magistri Tolosani Chronicon Faventinum, p. 21: Anno MXLV conbusta est Faventia et maior ecclesia cum instrumentìs eiusdem destructa est turris magna que erat in Caminica [Canonica]. a fire consumed Faenza, and the cathedral along with it. The scrinium, where the diocese's documents were kept, was severely damaged. An effort was made immediately to recover, repair, or restore the most important documents. On 23 April, a large public meeting took place next to the wall of the cathedral, Bishop Eutychius (Etico) presiding, and the constitutions of the Cathedral Chapter were reconstructed. The Chapter and the Canonica, it was remembered, had been instituted by Bishop Paulus, and had provided for thirty Canons.Tonduzzi, pp. 152-155: Necessarium duximus tradere memoria textam cartularum nostrae Canonicae quas scimus Iudicio Dei igne consumptas. Et maximè qualiter Domnus Paulus Religiosus Episcopus ordinavit Canonicam et Canonicos supradictae Fav(entinae) Ecclesiae num. xxx. The properties from which they derived their income included the cathedral parish, the parish of S. Pietro in luna, the monastery of S. Stephen Protomartyr in Faenza, the monastery of S. Vitale, and the monastery of S. Savini, along with numerous towns and estates.Tonduzzi, p. 153. A note in the archives of the Cathedral Chapter indicates that Bishop Federico Manfredi (1471-1478) was the last bishop to be elected by the Chapter.Messeri, p. 60, column 1: ultimus ad episcopatum electus a capitulo legitur canonicus Federicus de Manfredis. In 1682, the Chapter was composed of three dignities and fifteen Canons.Ritzler- Sefrin, V, p. 198, note 1. In 1742, there were sixteen Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 213, note 1. Synods A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See.

Cardinal Francesco Cennini, Bishop of Faenza (1623–1643), presided over a diocesan synod on 26 April 1629. On 4–6 July 1647, Cardinal Carlo Rossetti, Bishop of Faenza (1643–1681), celebrated his first diocesan synod. His second synod took place on 7 October 1649. The third synod was held on 1 June 1651.

Eubel, I, p. 246. *Theodericus, O.P. (1274-1281)Teoderico was already installed as bishop on 1 March 1274. His election, however, was labelled as due to simony by Fra Salimbene: quasi violenter et simoniace factus fuit et pretio et mediantibus minis. His date of death is unattested. Messeri, p. 42, note 1. Eubel, I, p. 246. *Vivianus (1282-1287)Vivianus had been Archdeacon of Arezzo. He was appointed Bishop of Faenza by Pope Martin IV on 25 January 1282. He took part in a provincial council that met at Forlì in 1286. He died on 7 August 1287. Ughelli, p. 500 (whose date of 1281 for Vivianus' appointment is wrong, since Martin IV was not elected until 22 February 1281). Scaletta, p. 41.

(1311-1336)A member of the Observant Franciscans, Ugolinus was present at the synod of Ravenna in June 1311 as Bishop-elect. By 3 July he had received consecration as a bishop.

(1337-1342)Fra Giovanni was a native of Faenza. He had been a monk at the Priory of S. Perpetua in Faenza. He was elected by the Chapter, probably on 8 May 1336; was approved by the Archbishop of Ravenna, and consecrated in Faenza by Bishop Ramboldus of Imola. But since his election had not been properly notified to Pope Benedict XII, he was compelled to freely resign his bishopric. The Pope then appointed (provided) him again on 6 May 1337. He died in 1342 (Eubel), in July (according to Cappelletti, followed by Gams) or 1339 (Ughelli). His successor was elected on 25 January 1343. Ughelli, p. 501. Cappelletti, p. 273. Eubel, I, p. 246.

He attended the Council of Pisa in 1409, at which the contending popes, Benedict XIII and Gregory XII, were deposed for heresy and schism. Pago was transferred to the metropolitan diocese of Spalato (Split, in Dalmatia) on 19 October 1411 by John XXIII (Baldassare Cossa). He died on 30 December 1426. Messeri, p. 51, note 2. Eubel, I, p. 460. : Sede vacante (1411–after 1414)A document dated 3 March 1414 states that the See had been vacant for two years because of the schism, vacante episcopatu faventino episcopo et vacaverit iam duobus annis propter sisimam (sic) regnantem inter pastores Ecclesiae, quorum unus sufficeret gubernator. Messeri, p. 52 column 1. :[Antonio de Solarolo]Antonio was elected by the Cathedral Chapter, and in a document dated 14 July 1416, he is named as Rev. pater dominus, dominus Antonius de Solarolo Dei gratia faventinus ellectus, nec non commendatarius monasterii sancti Prosperi de Faventia. He never obtained papal confirmation of any of the contenders for the papal throne (Gregory XII, John XXIII, and Benedict XIII). Messeri, pp. 51-52, note 3. *Silvestro de la Casa (1418?–1428)Silvestro was a native of Florence. The earliest documentary evidence of his episcopacy is dated 4 April 1418. Reports that he was elected or appointed in 1412 (Ughelli and others), or 1415, are without foundation, as Messeri, p. 52 note 1, points out. There is a Bull of Pope Martin V dated 7 February 1418, that refers to a Bishop of Faenza, who is undoubtedly Bishop Silvestro, granting him powers to be used to found a new hospital in honor of S. Maria della Misericordia in Faenza. He died in 1428. Eubel, I, p. 246. *Giovanni da Faventia, O.Min. (1428–1438)Giovanni was appointed bishop by Pope Martin V on 5 November 1428.

He was elected bishop of Faenza by the Chapter of the Cathedral on 16 September 1438, the day following the death of Bishop Giovanni. His election was confirmed by Pope Eugenius IV on 12 December 1438, who reserved the right to select the next bishop himself. In 1440 Bishop Zanelli transferred the remains of S. Savino from Selva Liba (near Fusignano) to the cathedral. On 6 July 1444, he presented the Observant Franciscans with the convent and church of S. Perpetua, which had been vacated by the Canons Regular of S. Marco of Mantua. He died in 1454. Messeri, p. 53, note 2. Eubel, II, p. 152 with note 1. : Sede Vacante (1454–1455)The vacancy in the episcopal seat began with the death of Bishop Giovanni, O.Min., and was still in progress according to a document dated 24 August 1555 naming the Vicar Capitular who was governing the diocese, Alexander de Stampittis decretorun doctor, nec non canonicus fav. et vicarius ven. dom. canonicorum et tocius capituli.... propter mortem Revmi in Christo patris d. Fratris Francisci olim episcopi faventini. Messeri, pp. 54-55. Eubel's date (p. 152) is therefore an error. *Giovanni Terma (1455–1457)Giovanni was a native of Siena. On 16 May 1469, Bishop Giovanni's Vicar General, Canon Graziado de' Diaterni, stated that Bishop Giovanni was elected on 18 September 1455: de anno 1455 a decima octava septembris usque ad vigesimum diem decembris anni 1457 fuit et stetit episcopus faventinus rev. pater d. Iohannes de Senis, qui erat homo multum pinguis et grossus corpore et non aptus et habilis ad sese evercitandum, attento consueto suo otio et dicti corporis gravitate. He described Bishop Giovanni as large and fat, adverse to exercise and given to leisure. He was a master of theology and Doctor in utroque iure. He was often ill in 1456 and 1457; he wrote his Last Will and Testament on 5 October 1457, and died on 20 December 1457. Messeri, p. 54, column 2 note 1. Eubel, II, p. 152. *Alessandro Stampetti (1458–1463)Alessandro di Taddeo Stampetti da Sarnano was a Doctor of Canon Law and Canon of the Cathedral Chapter. He had been Vicar Capitular during the Sede vacante of 1454–1455. He was provided as bishop of Faenza by Pope Calixtus III in a bull of 16 January 1458. He died in February 1463.

His name was submitted to Pope Pius II, who quashed the election because Federico was below the minimum canonical age. Instead the Pope conferred the bishopric on Bartolomeo Gandolfi, a Canon of the Cathedral and its iudex capituli. Gandolfi died in July 1470. Messeri, p. 55 note 1; p. 56 note 1. *Federico Manfredi (1470-1478)Manfredi was the son of the ruler of Faenza, and a Protonotary Apostolic. He had been elected bishop of Faenza once before, in 1463, but on 20 February Pope Pius II rejected him, because he was below the minimum age. He is recorded as merely a Protonotary and Canon in a document of 19 July 1470, but as Bishop of Faenza on 21 December 1470 (Messeri, p. 56, column 2). In the popular uprising of November 1477 he was forced to flee the city. He died on 28 September 1478. Cappelletti, pp. 281-282. Eubel, II, p. 152 with notes 3 and 4. *Battista de' Canonici, O.S.B.

Giovanni Battista. For reasons unknown, Pope Sixtus IV quashed the election. A document of 30 March 1479 indicates that the See was still vacant, though on 11 September 1479 Bishop Battista de' Canonici is in office. Messeri, pp. 59-60, note. Eubel, II, p. 152, with note 5, states that Battista was entered on the Oblates Register on 5 October 1478. Bishop (Giovanni) Battista died on or before 1 April 1510. from 1500 to 1800 *Giacomo Pasi (1510–1528)Born in 1468 of the jurisconsult Bartolomeo Pasi of Faenza, Pasi had been ambassador of Faenza to the Papal Court.

Renowned for their scurrilous humour and highly stylised animation, it was created in 2004, initially as a website publishing single panel jokes and then as series of irregularly released comics. The initial pilot programme was commissioned by Channel 4 as part of their Comedy Lab series and broadcast on 10 May 2005. Series one was first broadcast between 11 July to 15 August 2006. Following the DVD release of the first series in November 2007, a second series was shown between 23 January and 27 February 2008. The show features the voices of Lee Kern, Mackenzie Crook, Simon Greenall, Paul Kaye, Doon Mackichan, Lucy Scott, Anthony Davis, David Schall and Ralph Brown. The show was aired on the Independent Film Channel (IFC) in the United States and in 30+ territories including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Poland, Finland, Ukraine, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia Herzegovina, Macedonia, Philippines, Bulgaria, Iceland and the African territories reached by MNet. The series last played in the United Kingdom on 4Music in 2011 and the pilot episode received an airing on Channel 4 in August 2012. Characters The following recurring cartoons appear regularly in the programme: *Alan: the figurehead of Modern Toss, Alan is a cartoon scrawl who repeatedly sabotages his middle-class friends' get-togethers, resulting in his fleeing, pursued by \\"Roger\\", shouting, \\"Come back, Alan, you wanker!\\" *Accident & Emergency/Citizens Advice/Customer Services: members of the public ask a patient woman at a help-desk bizarre and often ridiculous questions. Contains the recurring theme of an angry Texan yelling into the phone, complaining profanely about a recently purchased cheeseburger, and who appears in every segment, regardless of the topic. *Barney: a man who periodically turns into a red Incredible Hulk-like monster at the mention of Alan Titchmarsh, and causes destruction in a mad rage, followed by embarrassment at what he has done. *Drive-By Abuser: a blunt moped-rider who \\"considers\\" various things before hurling profane abuse at them. *Cheese and Wine: a person at a party asks someone a question, and the other replies in a coarse and aggressive manner. *Fly Talk: a pair of flies discuss goings-on, often involving being trapped in a celebrity's car/house/hat and witnessing unexpected behaviour (such as David Attenborough urinating on his open fire). *Gnat Burglar: a giant gnat which sucks the entire contents out of things and injects it into other things. *I Live 'Ere: a West Country farmer recounts his violent assaults on trespassing (English) members of the public. *Illegal Alphabet: a large number of human- sized letters that congregate in a field to form rude words (including odd portmanteaus such as \\"pipecock\\"); they are then ambushed by truncheon-wielding police. These scenes end with a Radio 4-style voiceover announcement, for example: \\"That was Illegal Alphabet in 'illegal piss meeting' followed by 'unauthorised shitcasket'\\". *Mr Tourette - Master Signwriter: a gruff Frenchman who creates inappropriate signs (more often than not, with a sexual leaning) for bewildered customers. *Peace & Quiet: a man who seeks peace and quiet in his garden, but is plagued by noise from neighbours and others nearby. *Planet Chat: a Jerry Springer-style talk show in which the Moon and several other celestial bodies argue, usually turning on the Earth in the end. *Prince Edward, Royal Entrepreneur: rarely seen in the programme, Prince Edward tries to profit from (often tasteless) Royalty-related merchandise. *Seawalker: another infrequent feature of series - a man with very long legs walks out of the sea onto the beach, whereupon a leg is severed by people playing frisbee. *Sneezeman: a little man with a huge nose who experiences uncontrollable sneezing fits, usually injuring himself and causing extensive damage to property. *Space Argument: two inept astronauts who disagree while carrying out routine space-related tasks. *Underground Wolf Gobbler: a giant semi-human monster that pops up out of the ground and eats things, i.e. trains or oncoming traffic. *Work: an unenthusiastic employee expresses his unwillingness to come in, or do any work. The theme music is the brindisi, \\"Libiamo ne' lieti calici\\", from La Traviata by Giuseppe Verdi.

Plus 5 The Seven Sins are: # Wealth without work. # Pleasure without conscience. # Knowledge without character. # Commerce without morality. # Science without humanity. # Religion without sacrifice. # Politics without principle.  History and influence  Mohandas Gandhi published his list of \\"Seven Social Sins\\" in 1925. (1940s photo) The list was published by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in his weekly newspaper Young India on October 22, 1925.The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (electronic edition), Vol. 33, pp. 133-134. , An almost identical list had been published six months earlier in England in a sermon at Westminster Abbey by Fredrick Lewis Donaldson. Gandhi wrote that a correspondent whom he called a \\"fair friend\\" had sent the list: \\"The... fair friend wants readers of Young India to know, if they do not already, the following seven social sins,\\" (the list was then provided). After the list, Gandhi wrote that \\"Naturally, the friend does not want the readers to know these things merely through the intellect but to know them through the heart so as to avoid them.\\" This was the entirety of Gandhi's commentary on the list when he first published it. In the decades since its first publication, the list has been widely cited and discussed. Some books have also focused on the seven sins or been structured around them: * Eknath Easwaran (1989). The Compassionate Universe: The Power of the Individual to Heal the Environment (listed, discussed, and served as chapter structure for book) , , * Stephen Covey(1989). Principle-Centered Leadership ( Chapter 7: Seven Deadly Sins (p. 87 to 93). * Frank Woolever (2011) Gandhi List of Social Sins: Lessons in Truth (focuses on the list) Many books have discussed the sins more briefly: * Peter J. Gomes (2007). The scandalous gospel of Jesus: What's so good about the good news? Page 122 states \\"Years ago, I was much encouraged when I discovered that Gandhi had a list of seven social sins that, if not resisted, could destroy both persons and countries. .... We live in a world in which these social sins flourish as much today as they did in Gandhi's time; surely the battle against them is still worth waging.\\" * Adam Taylor (2010). Mobilizing hope: Faith-inspired activism for a post-civil rights generation Page 155 mentions two of the social sins, stating \\"The recent economic collapse (now referred to as the Great Recession) reminds me of two social sins from Gandhi's famous list of seven deadly social sins. Gandhi warned about the dangers of wealth without work and commerce without morality....\\" * Thomas Weber (2011). \\"Gandhi's Moral Economics: the Sins of Wealth Without Work and Commerce Without Morality.\\"In: Page 141 lists the sins and their date of publication, stating that \\"These and many of Gandhi's own writings make it quite clear that the Mahatma did not compartmentalize his life. For him, economics together with politics, morality and religion formed an indivisible whole.\\" * Rana P. B. Singh (2006). \\"Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi.\\" In: Page 107 lists the sins and gives a 2 or 3 sentence explanation of each, stating \\"these are ideals, but they are more relevant in the present era of desperation and could easily be accepted.\\" They have also been anthologized: * Anil Dutt Misra (2008). Inspiring Thoughts Of Mahatma Gandhi Inspiring Thoughts Of Mahatma Gandhi Concept Publishing Co. (listed, p. 239)  Politics without principle  Regarding \\"politics without principle\\", Gandhi said having politics without truth(s) to justly dictate the action creates chaos, which ultimately leads to violence. Gandhi called these missteps \\"passive violence\\", ‘which fuels the active violence of crime, rebellion, and war.’ He said, \\"We could work 'til doomsday to achieve peace and would get nowhere as long as we ignore passive violence in our world.\\" Politics is literally defined as, \\"The struggle in any group for power that will give one or more persons the ability to make decisions for the larger group.\\" Mohandas Gandhi defined principle as, \\"the expression of perfection, and as imperfect beings like us cannot practice perfection, we devise every moment limits of its compromise in practice.\\" There are many different types of regimes in the world whose politics differ. Based on Gandhi’s Blunder Politics without Principle, a regime type might be more of a root of violence than another because one regime has more principle than the other. Regimes have different types of fighting and aggression tactics, each desiring different outcomes. This difference affects the actions taken by political heads in countries across the globe. Gandhi wrote, \\"An unjust law is itself a species of violence.\\" The aggression of one country on another may be rooted in the government's creation of an unjust law. For example, a war of irredentism fought for one state to reclaim territory that was lost due to a law promoting ethnic cleansing. Principle in one country could easily be a crime in another. This difference leads one to believe that the root of violence is inevitably present somewhere in the world. “Politics without Principle” will inevitably take place throughout time. : \\"I object to violence because when it appears to do good, the good is only temporary; the evil it does is permanent.\\" This list grew from Gandhi's search for the roots of violence. He called these \\"acts of passive violence\\". Preventing these is the best way to prevent oneself or one's society from reaching a point of violence, according to Gandhi. To this list, Arun Gandhi added an eighth blunder, \\"rights without responsibilities\\".Arun Gandhi's article According to Arun Gandhi, the idea behind the first blunder originates from the feudal practice of Zamindari. He also suggests that the first and the second blunders are interrelated.  Arun Gandhi description as \\"Seven Blunders\\"  Arun Gandhi, who was personally given the list by his grandfather, Mohandas Gandhi, has described it as a list of \\"Seven Blunders of the World\\" that lead to violence. More recently Mohandas Gandhi's list of negative qualities has also been described by his grandson as \\"Seven Blunders of the World\\". Examples of description under this heading include: * (profile of Arun Gandhi that gives a list entitled \\"Mohandas Gandhi's 'Seven Blunders of the World,'\\" and states that \\"The last time Arun saw his grandfather, the old man slipped the boy a piece of paper with a list of what have come to be known as Gandhi's 'Seven Blunders of the World' that lead to violence.\\" It also states that Arun Gandhi \\"would make 'Rights without responsibilities' No. 8 on his grandfather's list of 'blunders.'\\") * (p. 15, gives the list entitled \\"Gandhi's 'Seven Blunders of the World' that Lead to Violence,\\" plus \\"8.

It is one of the most widespread Pinguicula species, being found in mountainous regions from Iceland to the Himalayas. Native to cold climates, it is a temperate species, forming prostrate rosettes of green to red leaves and white flowers in the summer and a tight hibernaculum during a period of winter dormancy in the winter. Like all members of the genus, P. alpina uses mucilaginous glands covering the surface of its summer leaves to attract, trap, and digest arthropod prey. Description Pinguicula alpina is a small perennial herb, reaching a height of 5–15 cm (2-6 in.) when in flower. The plant is supported by 1–2 cm (0.4-0.8 in) long roots, which are fleshy, yellow-white and branching.Linnee, in Spec. pl. ed. 1 (1753) 17 P. alpina is the only temperate Pinguicula which retains these roots year-round; the roots of other temperate species wither with the winter dormancy. This allows it to invest more of its income (nutrients derived from prey) into long-term storage, compared to other subarctic Pinguicula which are income breeders and invest these nutrients into immediate plant size and flowering increases.Thorén, L. Magnus and Karlsson, P. Staffan (1998). Effects of supplementary feeding on growth and reproduction of three carnivorous plant species in a subarctic environment. Journal of Ecology; Jun98, Vol. 86 Issue 3, p501-510 Leaves P. alpina leaf rosette The five to eight fleshy, light-green to reddish, elliptic to lanceolate leaves form a ground-hugging rosette up to 6 cm (2.5 in) in diameter. The upper surface of the leaves are sticky from the mucilage secreted by stalked glands covering the leaf surface. Small insects alighting upon this surface are caught by the mucilage, upon which sessile glands embedded in the leaf surface (except for the central vein) secrete digestive enzymes to digest the prey. The leaves of this species are able to further aid digestion by growing such that the leaf edge rolls toward the center, bringing additional glands into contact with the prey. Most plants are reddish-green in full sun, though some plant will turn completely red while a smaller percentage will remain completely green.Patrat, Eric, 1998; Pinguicula alpina (trip report) Flowers and seeds Pinguicula alpina only begins flowering after several years of growth. Six to eight (occasionally up to 13) flowers are borne singly on unbranched inflorescences up to 12 cm (5 in) tall. The zygomorphic flowers are 10–16 mm (⅜-⅝ in) long with a short yellow-green spur and are composed of a two-lobed upper lip and three-lobed lower lip. They are white with one or sometimes three yellow markings on the lower lip. These can be variable in size and shape. The flowers are protogynous, meaning that the female stigmas mature before the male anthers, and are pollinated by flies. Fertilized flowers mature into 6–9 mm (¼-⅜ in) by 2–3 mm (1/16-⅛ in) seed capsules bearing copious numbers of tiny, rust-brown seeds. Vegetative reproduction forms clusters of plants like this one from Slovenia Vegetative reproduction Healthy plants produce 3 mm (⅛ in) bulblets at the leaf axils following the flowering period. These form new plants the following year, serving as a means of vegetative reproduction. Plants in arctic habitats do not form these bulblets. Hibernacula Pinguicula alpina is hemicryptophytic, in that the plant survives the cold winter conditions by reducing to a bud resting on the soil surface. This bud, called a hibernaculum, is composed of small, densely packed leaves, which unfurl with the coming of spring. Although most hibernacula in this genus lose their roots during this period, P. alpina is unique in that it retains them. Distribution P. alpina distribution shown in red Pinguicula alpina is found in high altitudes and latitudes throughout Europe and Asia, with the densest populations concentrated in the Alps and northern Scandinavia. Around the last ice age the plant was distributed throughout Asia, where it still remains today in Siberia, Mongolia, and the Himalayas. P. alpina is one of the most widely distributed members of the genus Pinguicula. In 2012, a population of more than 1000 P. alpina individuals was discovered in Ringhorndalen, Svalbard. Previously unknown to exist in the archipelago, it now marks the northernmost population of the species. Habitat and ecology This species grows from sea level in northwest Siberia to altitudes of up to 4,100 m (13,500 ft), in open, sunny locations. The plant prefers wet soils such as seeps with alkali to neutral pH. P. alpina is, however, unusually tolerant of soil dryness for a temperate butterwort. It is typically found in subalpine seeps or bogs or alpine rock-meadows. In alpine locations P. alpina is often found growing with Carex firma (an alpine grass), Bistorta officinalis, Dryas octopetala, and Pedicularis rostratocapitata. Here it most often grows in a Caricetum firmae plant association, part of the Seslerion albicantis (alpine bluegrass) plant community. In montane locations it is most often associated with Caricion davallianae and Cratoneurion commutati plant communities, growing together with Schoenus nigricans, Schoenus ferrugineus, Epipactis palustris, Cochlearia officinalis and Pinguicula vulgaris. Environmental status P. alpina growing in the Tatra Mountains of Slovakia. Due to its widespread distribution, P. alpina enjoys a relatively secure future. In some regions in Europe, however, it is uncommon enough to be threatened by development or agriculture. The species, for example, used to be found in northern Scotland, but has since been eradicated there and is no longer found growing natively on the British Isles. The species is protected in Germany by the \\"Bundesartenschutzverordnung\\", and is also protected locally in some Swiss cantons and the Pannonian and Alpine foothill regions of Austria. Uses European folk medicine didn't distinguish between various butterwort species, but prescribed them for sores, swelling, sciatica, and liver disease, as well as stomach aches, chest pain and respiratory problems. Its supposed effectiveness against these ailments is attributed to the cinnamic acid found in the plants. Taxonomy In 1583, Clusius distinguished between two butterwort forms in his Historia stirpium rariorum per Pannoniam, Austriam: a blue-flowered form (P. vulgaris) and a white-flowered form (P. alpina), which Linnaeus included in his Species Plantarum in 1753 along with P. villosa and P. lusitanica. Since that time countless subgenera, varieties and forms have been described in an attempt to reassign or further delimitate the species. These, however, have not gained wide acceptance. With the exception of the extremely rare P. crystallina, P. alpina is the only European species which is not a member of the section Pinguicula, belonging instead to the section Micranthus, of which it the type species. The other three species of this section are native to northern Russia, Siberia and Japan. Although it is not closely related, P. alpina forms natural hybrids with P. vulgaris, forming the hybrid Pinguicula × hybrida.

Standing 6'3\\" and weighing 195 pounds, Whitehurst attended the University of New Orleans where he compiled a 37-15 record. Career Originally selected by the Oakland Athletics in the third round of the 1985 MLB draft, Whitehurt became a member of the Mets organization when he was part of a three-team trade that took place on December 11, . He was sent by Oakland, with Kevin Tapani, to the Mets. The Los Angeles Dodgers sent Bob Welch and Matt Young to the Athletics, and Jack Savage to the Mets. The Athletics then sent Alfredo Griffin and Jay Howell to the Dodgers, with the Mets sending Jesse Orosco to the Dodgers. Whitehurst stayed in the minor leagues until July 17, , when he made his MLB debut at the age of 25. In one inning of work, he allowed one hit and walked three batters, surrendering two earned runs. His season did improve though, and he finished with a 4.50 earned run average in nine games. Whitehurst was used entirely as a reliever in , appearing in 38 games, which was tied for third most on the team. In 65+ innings, he walked only nine batters and posted a 3.29 ERA. Whitehurst appeared in 36 games in , starting more than half of them. His 7-12 record was the worst among all the pitchers who had started more than 10 games with the Mets that year, as was his 4.19 ERA. He was limited to the bullpen during the last month of the season. Although Whitehurst posted a 3.62 ERA in , his record was 3-9. He was traded to the Padres after the season—he was sent with D. J. Dozier and Raul Casanova for Tony Fernández. Whitehurst spent two seasons with the Padres, and , posting a record of 4-7 each season. After the 1994 season, he was released by the Padres and picked up by the San Francisco Giants. In April , the Giants released him and he was signed by the Boston Red Sox. Whitehurst was released by the Red Sox in July, but picked up by the Toronto Blue Jays a short time later. After the 1995 season-a year in which he saw no major league action-he was granted free agency and picked up by the Montreal Expos. In June , Whitehurst was selected off waivers from the Expos by the New York Yankees, and he started two games with them, winning one and losing one. In eight innings of big league work in 1996, he struck out only one batter (José Herrera). Whitehurst appeared in his final big league game on August 29, . Overall, he went 20-37 with a 4.02 ERA. He walked 130 batters and struck out 312 batters in 487+ innings of work. He batted .150 in 107 career at bats, and his fielding percentage was .948. He wore number 47 while with the Mets, 41 with the Padres and 55 with the Yankees. He spent five seasons with Dwight Gooden and David Cone-longer than any other teammates. Since Whitehurst's playing days ended, he has been a pitching coach. He coached the Arizona League Padres in 2004, the Eugene Emeralds in 2005 and 2006, the Fort Wayne Wizards in 2007, and the Lake Elsinore Storm in 2008. After serving as a substitute teacher at his old high school, Terrebonne High School in Houma, Louisiana, Whitehurst has since become the pitching coach for the Lynchburg Hillcats of the Carolina League. However, in 2010, the Pirates and Cincinnati Reds swapped minor league franchises. As a result, the Reds took control of the Hillcats, while the Pirates received Cincinnati's Sarasota Reds. The Pirates then moved Sarasota's operations to nearby Bradenton, where the club was renamed the Bradenton Marauders. Whitehurst then served as the pitching coach for the Altoona Curve. Whitehurst has left the ranks of coaching professional baseball and is currently living in Houma and working as a salesman in the oil and gas Industry.

Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States, Bangladesh, and Eastern India, but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere's summer and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across Europe, Asia, and Australia. Tornadic events are often accompanied with other forms of severe weather, including strong thunderstorms, strong winds, and hail. Events=United States yearly total=January There were 5 tornadoes confirmed in the United States in January. January 19 Four minor tornadoes were caused by a bow echo in Georgia and Alabama. Four people were injured by an F0 tornado near Montgomery, Alabama. Eight more were injured when another F0 struck a shopping center near Hartsfield International Airport. Two other tornadoes in Georgia (rated F0 and an F1) caused negligible damage and no injuries.NCDC Storm Events-Select State February There were 30 tornadoes confirmed in the United States in February. February 16 An F2 tornado touched down near Goodman, Mississippi damaging cabins, downing trees, and tossing vehicles. One woman was crushed to death by her car after abandoning it for a ditch-- considered better shelter from a tornado than a vehicle. Four F0 tornadoes also occurred, with no injuries. February 24–25 Destroyed mobile home in Arkansas from a tornado that occurred on February 24. A moderate tornado outbreak affected several southern US states. A line of tornado-producing supercells formed out in front of a squall line which produced damaging winds. Over 10 hours, multiple tornadoes touched down and caused $35 million in damage, primarily in Arkansas and Mississippi. The outbreak began on the 24th, and multiple tornadoes began touching down in Arkansas that evening. An F2 tornado that impacted the towns of Sweet Home and College Station, destroying homes, mobile homes, and a church. The tornado downed many trees and power lines and injured 8 people. Another F2 tornado near Union heavily damaged a dairy barn and the roofs of several homes. Many trees were downed, and three mobile homes were destroyed, resulting in a fatality and three injuries. An F3 tornado touched down near Reed, and moved northeast. Roofs were damaged at several homes. In addition, the tornado rolled a 500-gallon butane tank, damaged or destroyed metal barns and sheds, and knocked down hundreds of trees. Near the town of Kelso, the tornado completely destroyed a metal farm shop, and pieces of debris from the structure were found 6 miles away. Also near the shop, a pickup truck was mangled with several large farm implements thrown, overturned or destroyed. A tractor-trailer was flipped before the tornado dissipated near Snow Lake. Tornado activity began to spread into Mississippi later that night, and an F3 tornado caused major damage near Greenwood. Another F3 tornado touched down near Bruce before moving east and slamming into Pontotoc, where major damage occurred. At least 360 homes, 15 businesses and 2 churches were damaged or destroyed in Pontotoc. Among the homes destroyed was a restored antebellum plantation home listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Numerous trees and power lines were blown down. Six people were killed in town, and 43 others were injured. The tornado then struck Baldwyn, where 100 homes were damaged or destroyed, and the Baldwyn High School which lost the roof to its gymnasium. Past Baldwyn, the tornado struck Guntown, where 8 homes and 1 business were heavily damaged, while 13 other structures were damaged. Lesser damage occurred in Saltillo and Wheeler before the tornado dissipated. Additional weak tornadoes occurred in Tennessee on the 25th before the event came to an end.

The Storm Prediction Center was already predicting a chance of thunderstorms on Wednesday. The area forecast discussion started mentioning a \\"severe potential\\" on Tuesday, also mentioning \\"severe storms with large hail and damaging winds possible\\". By the morning of October 24, the SPC was on its highest alert after issuing a high risk for severe weather for Indiana, middle Kentucky, eastern Illinois, southern Michigan, and western Ohio. The surrounding area was in a slight risk. At 5:00 A.M., a severe weather outlook was issued highlighting the fact that the area was under a high risk as well as a possibility of tornadoes. By 11:30 A.M., the SPC issued a Public Severe Weather Outlook calling for \\"intense tornadoes\\" in the area. Just 15 minutes later, the SPC issued a Particularly Dangerous Situation Tornado Watch for northern Indiana, and northwestern Ohio. At around 12:30 P.M., a line of storms began forming in central and eastern Illinois and moved east.

These early-season races are competed mainly by French teams and are considered preparations for Paris–Nice, the first European World Tour event in March. History The Tour Méditerranéen (\\"Tour of the Mediterranean Sea\\") was created by former Tour de France winner Lucien Aimar in 1974. The event was named Trophée Méditerranéen for its first four editions. Run in February, the five-day stage race was won by several eminent riders, including Eddy Merckx, Gianni Bugno, Tony Rominger, Laurent Jalabert and Paolo Bettini. Gerrie Knetemann holds the record with three victories. In 2012 licensing problems between the organizers and the French Cycling Federation emerged, nearly spelling the cancellation of the event before a deal was ultimately reached. Financial difficulties led to the discontinuation of the race in 2015 after organizers failed to pay debts from the previous edition. In 2016 the race was revived as La Méditerranéenne and scaled back to four days. The rejuvenated edition was won by Ukrainian Andriy Hrivko. Route From 1974 until 2014 the race was held in the southern French region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, but also occasionally featured stages in Liguria, Italy. Traditionally, a summit finish on the Mont Faron in Toulon was staged every year. As from 2016, the re-invented La Méditerranéenne is contested over four days.

History Penn Central Silverliner at West Chester in 1970 The branch was composed of rail lines built by two companies in the 19th century. One portion, a line from West Chester to Malvern, was built after 1831 by the West Chester Railroad.Jones, James A. \\"A Brief History of Transportation in West Chester\\". Accessed 2010-01-02. The PRR leased the line in 1859, and moved the Malvern end to a junction at Frazer in 1880. The PRR acquired the West Chester Railroad in 1903. The other portion, a line from Philadelphia to West Chester, was built by the West Chester and Philadelphia Railroad (WC&P;) between 1852 and 1858. In 1880, the WC&P; was purchased by the PRR-controlled Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (PWB), which merged it the following year into the Philadelphia and Baltimore Central Railroad.ICC valuation report of the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad, filed June 30, 1918 As the PRR's West Chester Branch, the line offered commuter rail service between Philadelphia, Media, and West Chester, the county seat of Chester County.

In 1971 and 1972, there were washouts on the nearby Chester Creek Branch and Octoraro Branch, due to heavy storms and Hurricane Agnes. Subsequently, the Penn Central (PC) ended service north of West Chester and parts of the nearby branches and removed some of the tracks. Today, the right-of-way can still be seen in places. Later years After the PC bankruptcy and the formation of Conrail in 1976, operations and ownership of the West Chester Branch was ceded to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in 1983. SEPTA operated the line as its R3-Media/West Chester service until 1986, when service was truncated to Elwyn. As of early 2014, SEPTA operates commuter rail operations on the line between Philadelphia and Elwyn, while the West Chester Railroad operates a scenic excursion train on weekends between West Chester and Glen Mills. Occasional nocturnal freight service occurs via Amtrak to obtain track ballast from a quarry in Glen Mills. Restoration of service SEPTA plans to restore rail service west of Elwyn to a new Park and Ride station in Wawa in 2021.

His architectural style ranged from art deco to mid-century modern, while his etchings of the 1920s-30s documented scenes of Native American and Mexican life in the American Southwest. Early life and Family Frederick Monhoff was born in New York City to Emil Monhoff (1865-1922) and Maria Therese Kremer Monhoff (1864-1951). As a boy, Monhoff moved to Los Angeles with his family. He served in the United States Navy during World War I and later attended the University of California, Berkeley where he received an M.A. in 1921. At Berkeley, Monhoff served on the staff of the school's literary journal The Occident. On June 29, 1926, Monhoff married Hildegarde Flanner and they settled in Altadena, California. Monhoff illustrated several of Flanner's books of poetry and essays with his drawings and etchings. The couple had one child, John, born March 15, 1941. Hildegarde's sister was Janet Flanner, a long time Paris correspondent for The New Yorker, (writing under the pen name Genet). In 1962, Monhoff and his family moved north to Calistoga, California, in the Napa Valley and he died there in 1975. Career Monhoff served as a design architect for the Los Angeles County Architectural Divisions and designed numerous public buildings and private residences in Southern California in the Los Angeles area, Malibu, Santa Barbara, Palm Springs, Orange County, and in Northern California in the Napa Valley. Monhoff taught design at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles (1926-1950) and at the Pasadena Art Institute (1959). During the 1940s, he also taught architecture at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In 1924, the International Printmakers Society of California awarded Monhoff a bronze medal for Best Print or Best Series of Prints. Monhoff's etching Clothes Burning Ceremony is listed in the Art Institute of Chicago's 1932 exhibition catalog First International Exhibition of Etching and Engraving.

Early life She was born Stella Goldschlag and raised in Berlin as the only child in a middle-class, assimilated Jewish family.Diana Tovar, Summary of Peter Wyden's Stella University of California, Santa Barbara (Fall 2005). Retrieved July 29, 2011 After the 1933 seizure of power by the Nazis, she, like other Jewish children, was forbidden to go to a state school, so she attended the Goldschmidt School, set up by the local Jewish community. At school, she was known for her beauty and vivacity. The family fell on hard times when Jews were purged from positions of influence and her father, , lost his job with the newsreel company Gaumont. Her parents attempted to leave Germany after Kristallnacht in 1938 to escape the Nazi regime, but were unable to gain visas for other countries. Stella completed her education in 1938, training as a fashion designer at the School of Applied Art in Nürnbergerstraße.The Forger, Cioma Schonhaus, Granta Books, 2004, pp140-141 Going underground and collaboration In 1941, she married a Jewish musician, Manfred Kübler. They had met when both were working as Jewish forced-labourers in a war plant in Berlin. In about 1942, when the large deportation programme of Berlin Jews into extermination camps began, she disappeared underground, using forged papers to pass as a non-Jew — owing to her blonde-haired, blue-eyed 'Aryan' appearance. In the spring of 1943, she and her parents were arrested by the Nazis. Stella Kübler was subjected to torture. In order to avoid deportation of herself and her parents, she agreed to become a \\"catcher\\" () for the Gestapo, hunting down Jews hiding as non-Jews (referred to as \\"submerged\\", ). She was promised a salary of 300 Reichsmark for each Jew that she betrayed. She proceeded to comb Berlin for such Jews and, as she was familiar with a large number of Jewish people from her years at her segregated Jewish school, Kübler was very successful at locating her former schoolmates and handing their information over to the Gestapo, while posing as a submerged herself. Some of Kübler's efforts to apprehend Jews in hiding included promising them food and accommodation, meanwhile turning them over to the Nazi authorities; she would also follow clues provided to her by the Gestapo.Carsten Dams and Michael Stolle, The Gestapo: Power and Terror in the Third Reich (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 71. The data concerning the number of her victims varies, depending on different sources of information, from between 600 and 3,000 Jews. Stella Kübler's charisma and striking good looks were a great advantage in her pursuit of underground Jews. The Nazis called her \\"blonde poison\\". She is mentioned in The Forger, Cioma Schonhaus's 2004 account of living as an underground Jew in Berlin,The Forger, also by )Cioma Schonhaus (Granta Books, 2004) and in Berlin at War by Roger Moorhouse (2010). The Nazis would break their promise of sparing the lives of Kübler's parents. They were deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp, where they were killed. Kübler's husband, Manfred, was deported in 1943 to Auschwitz, along with his family. Kübler still continued her work for the Gestapo until March 1945. During that time, she met and married her second husband, Rolf Isaaksohn, on 29 October 1944. Isaksohn, a fellow Jewish collaborator with the Nazis known also as a Greifer (\\"catcher\\"). The end of the war and after At the end of World War II, Kübler went into hiding. She was found and arrested by the Soviets in October 1945 and sentenced to ten years of hard labor. Following the completion of her sentence, she moved to West Berlin. There she was again tried and convicted, and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. She did not have to serve the second sentence because of the time already served in the Soviet prison. Stella's only child, Yvonne Meissl, was taken from her and became a nurse in Israel. After the war, Kübler, according to Irving Abrahamson, \\"convert[ed] to Christianity and bec[ame] an open anti-Semite\\". Kübler committed suicide in 1994 by throwing herself out of the window of her apartment in Freiburg. Personal life Stella Kübler was married five times: Following the deportation of her first husband, Manfred Kübler, she married fellow Jewish collaborator and Greifer Rolf Isaaksohn on 29 October 1944, who was shot dead attempting to escape to Denmark as the Soviets advanced. After the war, she was married to three non-Jews, starting with Friedheim Schellenberg. Her last husband died in 1984. In biographies and fiction Peter Wyden, a Berlin schoolmate whose family had been able to obtain US visas in 1937 and who later learned about Stella's role as a \\"catcher\\" while he was working for the U.S. Army, tracked down and interviewed Kübler in 1988, and wrote Stella, a 1992 biography of her. In 2019, the German journalist Takis Würger published a novel based on Kübler's life, ', which was published by Carl Hanser Verlag. It received largely negative reviews. Critics described the work as \\"Holocaust kitsch\\", but it sold well. Kübler appears in Chris Petit's novel The Butchers of Berlin. Here, her actions as a \\"catcher\\" are in the background of the main story. References * Dams, Carsten, and Michael Stolle. The Gestapo: Power and Terror in the Third Reich.

Summary Naka Kaburagi has all the qualities a model can have. Well, not really all. After being dumped by her senpai because she can't smile like a flower and has a scary face, Naka is determined to get her revenge and to show her senpai that she can smile like a flower just like his female idol Umi Kajiwara. After failing her 19th audition, Naka accidentally bumps into the great Umi, but wait.....what is this!? Umi is a MALE!!? To keep Naka's mouth shut, Umi gives her the job as his co-model. Always being together and sharing a dark secret, Naka's road to successful modeling has a lot of troubles to come, especially when Naka and Umi started to feel funny whenever they are by each other's side. Characters '''''' *Nickname: :A unpopular 14-year-old model who, when nervous, has a face that looks like a criminal's. After getting rejected by her Senpai because he preferred the popular female model Umi’s smile to her own, Naka joins the same modeling company as Umi in hopes of finding out the secret to Umi’s smile and becoming a popular model to get back at her Senpai. :At first, Naka resents Umi for her charming smile and ability to land modeling jobs seemingly effortlessly, but her resentment soon fades after Naka finds out Umi’s secret. The sweet charming female model Umi is really a possessive, cross-dressing male. After finding out his secret, Umi lands Naka a job modeling for the popular clothing brand “Junk” in exchange for her silence, which she agrees to after seeing it as a step towards getting revenge on her Senpai. :Even though Umi is constantly seen harassing and insulting Naka, throughout the series they become close friends and eventually develop feelings for each other. The two share a kiss after Umi finds out that Naka is going for a job for the brand “Heki”, a job Umi had been aspiring towards his whole career. Though the kiss was mostly due to Umi’s jealousy and hurt, it leads to the two growing much closer in their relationship and even taking on a romantic atmosphere in the later chapters. :Briefly, Tsutsumi Ikue, a high fashion photographer, was a rival for Naka’s love but it was shown in later chapters that he was just using Naka as a replacement for his ex-girlfriend, Najafuji Mihane. Naka was torn between Tsutsumi and Umi for a short period of time since she was able to take beautiful pictures both with Umi and with Tsutsumi, which led her to doubt her feelings for Umi, and likewise, he started to doubt her feelings for him. In book 16, she and Umi are shown attending Ikue and Mihane's wedding reception and the two kiss at the end. '''''' *Nickname: :A 14-year-old cross- dressing supermodel that enchants men and women alike with his charming smile. Umi is known for being a beautiful, charming female supermodel when in reality ‘she’ is actually a rude pervert who lacks tact and social restraint when being himself. In the beginning of the series Umi’s true gender is only known by the president, referred throughout the series as Ms. President, of Boom! modeling agency, the agency that employs both Umi and Naka. While he chooses to reveal his gender to Ms. President, Naka stumbles across Umi’s true gender by accident which leads him to offer her a modeling job for the popular clothing brand “Junk” in exchange for her silence. :Soon after Naka discovers Umi's secret it is revealed he is also the president of her high school, something she had never noticed before since he is in his true gender while at school. Also while at school, Umi doesn’t hold back his true personality which causes him to have a reputation as \\"demon\\" and to be feared by most of the student body. Surprisingly, despite his low attendance Umi has top grades and always makes sure everything for the student council is handled in a business- like fashion. :Umi is hinted to have feelings for Naka at the beginning of the series, shown through his constant sexual harassment and embarrassment when Naka compliments him. When Tsutsumi Ikue appears and shows a very blatant interest in Naka, Umi’s feelings become clear and he even confesses he is in love with Naka to Ms. President. :Though Umi is shown to be very two-faced and cruel throughout the series, he has a softer side which is generally shown when dealing with Naka or matters concerning Naka. Also as time progresses Umi is shown becoming more and more masculine in looks and therefore threatening his chance of ever becoming the face for “Heki”. '''''' :A 17-year-old genius photographer who thinks Umi is stiff and dull. He only sees Umi as wearing some kind of mask because he/she never looks natural to him. In volume 4, Ikue reveals to Naka that he likes her, but this is only his way to test Umi and Naka's relationship if they will end up like him and Mihane. He loves strawberry-flavored snacks. He and Mihane end up together again and three years later, they get married. :Though as of lately, Ikue has been covering for Umi when his gender identity was in danger of being discovered.

Often called \\"Chi,\\" he is Mihane and Ikue's best friend. He has a long-time crush on Mihane Nagafuji. He befriends Umi in a way and they often talk to each other about their love lives. After Ichigo confessed to him, he became confused about his feelings for her. During the festival, he saw a guy patting and talking to Ichigo, and Umi asked him \\"Are you jealous?\\" in which Chihiro replied \\"Really?\\" and \\"But I can't forget her.\\" And Umi said, \\"Getting jealous is the best proof.\\" They end up together. ' :She is the younger twin of Kaede Arita. Ichigo and her brother design clothes and are known in public as the 17 years old designers, Kaede Koumoto and Ichigo Koumoto. She is pretty small and is actually the same age as Naka and Umi. She fell in love with Chihiro Akiyama and confessed to him and that she will make him fall crazily in love with her. She can see through Chihiro easily like when is he laughing even when he isn't even happy and that he wants to be loved and hugged tightly. She has bad eyesight and can be seen talking to random objects instead of people. Three years later, her hair grew because Chihiro once said she should grow her hair out and they end up together. ' :She is the older sister of Azu Nagafuji and she was the first ever model for Heki.

Nubia has been one of the earliest humanly inhabited lands in the world. Its history is tied to that of Egypt, from which it became independent in the 10th century BC. The rich gold deposits in Nubia made the latter the target of Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans and later Arabs. Research on Nubia has allowed scholars to find several of its references. Historical References to Nubia=Egyptians Ancient Egyptians called the land down south from the first cataract of the Nile River Tanehsu. In Tanehsu, they called the land between the first and second cataracts, Wawat. That region was very rich in gold. Egyptians exploited it for almost three millennia. Napatans and Ptolemy II of Egypt exploited it as well. During the Old Kingdom, the Egyptians called the land between the second and third cataracts Medja and its inhabitants the Medjay (Mazzoi in later Greek translation); however, by the Middle Kingdom \\"Medjay\\" referred to a group of desert nomads who wandered in and out of what used to be Medja, many of whom were employed as archers and/or in the Egyptian Army and eventually became an elite group of guardsmen; by the New Kingdom, the word essentially meant \\"police inspector.\\" The term Nubia came from Nortat, the name Egyptians used around the New Kingdom to refer to tribes living on their southern boundaries. Greeks and Romans Greeks occupied Egypt from the Ptolemaic Period (332-30BC), they called the land south of Egypt, Ethiopia. Romans adopted that name for Nubia when they came and defeated the Ptolemaic Dynasty. Arabs and English Arabs conquered Egypt in 641AD, and were planning to attack Bilad al-Sudan, the land of the blacks. That was the name Arabs used to refer to Nubia. That name was still used in 1820, when Mohammed Ali Pasha or Mehmet Ali became the viceroy of Egypt. When The English came and conquered the area, they adopted the name Sudan from the Arab term to refer to that area. References * El Mahdi, Mandour. 1965. A Short History of the Sudan. Pg 1-3.

Some of the original inhabitants left Cattawood in 1730 to join up with Cudjoe in Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town). According to one story, a group of one hundred men women and children went to join Cudjoe, and they were probably members of the group led by Captain Cuffee, who was one of Cudjoe's deputies at the signing of the 1739 peace treaty with the Leeward Maroons. They retained their name subsequently settling in Cotterwood in Saint Elizabeth Parish.The History of the Maroons from their Origin to the Establishment of their Chief Tribe at Sierra Leone by Robert Charles Dallas, London 1802 pp. 44-5.

QANTAS 1929 305px Following the success of the de Havilland DH.50J in Australia, the company was asked to design a larger replacement using a Bristol Jupiter engine. The cabin had room for six to eight passengers with the pilot in an open cockpit behind the wings. The aircraft took only 10 weeks to design and the prototype first flew in December 1927. Following test flights in England, the aircraft was sent to de Havilland Australia in Melbourne. After reassembly, the prototype first flew on 2 March 1928 and was used on scheduled services between Adelaide and Broken Hill by MacRobertson Miller Aviation. The prototype was originally called Canberra which was used as a type name until it was changed to Giant Moth. A total of 10 aircraft were built, including one in Canada built from components with the rest coming from the Stag Lane production line. Three aircraft for Canada (G-CAPG), (G-CARD) and (G-CAJT) were fitted with Short Brothers floats at Rochester before one was delivered to Canadian Vickers. This aircraft (G-CAJT) was sent to Western Canada Airlines Ltd. on a rental arrangement. During a proving flight on 23 October 1928, the Giant Moth suffered structural damage in the air and crashed at Calgary, Alberta in a non-fatal accident. Molson 1974, p. 43.

He wrote it in 1967, and it was first performed at the Brown Beret junta in Elysian Park, East Los Angeles. The play examines stereotypes of Latinos in California and how they are treated by local, state, and federal governments. Plot The short play is set in Honest Sancho's Used Mexican Lot and Mexican Curio Shop, a fictional Californian store that apparently sells various \\"models\\" (robots) of stereotypical Mexicans and Mexican-Americans that buyers can manipulate by simply snapping their fingers and calling out commands. The action of the play revolves around \\"The Secretary,\\" a character by the name of Miss Jiménez, who converses with Honest Sancho, the owner of the store. Sancho says her name with Spanish pronunciation ( or, roughly, ), though she chastises him for speaking bad English, demanding that it be pronounced as the Anglicized . Miss Jiménez explains to the courteous Honest Sancho that she is a secretary for Governor Reagan and that his administration is looking to purchase \\"a Mexican type\\" to appeal to a lower income crowd. Sancho shows the Secretary four different models, snapping his fingers in order to bring them to life and demonstrate their behaviors. Although Miss Jiménez is herself evidently a Chicana (Mexican-American), she seems completely ignorant to the cultural stereotypes displayed in each of the four buyable characters. First, Sancho shows her the sturdy Farm Worker, but she refuses to buy him because he speaks no English. Second, they examine the \\"Johnny Pachuco,\\" a 1950s Chicano gang member model who is violent, profane, and drug-abusing, though an easy scapegoat and perfect to brutalize. Third, when Miss Jiménez asks for a more romantic model, they come to the Revolucionario, one of the glorified bandit/martyrs of early Californian history; however, she denies him when she learns that he is completely Mexican and not even American-made. Finally, they come to the most contemporary Mexican-American model, named \\"Eric Garcia\\": a well-dressed and exciting public speaker who is university-educated, ambitious, bilingual, and polite. Miss Jiménez very reluctantly agrees to buy Eric for $15,000, when suddenly he begins staging a vocal protest in Spanish: \\"¡Viva la raza! ¡Viva la huelga! ¡Viva la revolución!\\" (Long live the people! Long live the strike! Long live the revolution!). Soon he snaps the three other models awake and they join in his miniature uprising. After Jiménez flees in fright, the four models converse among each other, revealing that they, in fact, are not robots, but rather, living human beings. They leave the lot and share the money amongst themselves, and Sancho stays still; it is he who is the robot. One of the people take him for an oil job and the play ends. Analysis Luiz Valdez wrote this play to enhance awareness to the different stereotypes in 1960 Americas, and how other people treated him. Luis Valdez himself was a Chicano and immigrant from Mexico. The Sellouts are people who sell out their culture and adapt to the culture of Americans. Valdez himself saw this as a huge problem to immigrant workers as it made people of his kind, who kept their culture, look bad. In this case, it is Miss Jimenez who was the Sellout.

The race series was created as a standalone series which began operating as such within numerous sanctioning bodies. The series was founded by the current National Director, Dave Derecola, and his son Chris Derecola, who continue to own and operate the series. The series currently races within the Porsche Club of America, under the direction of the National Director as a guest series.  Chapters  Racing under the 944 Cup rule set is currently possible in two regional chapters, East and West, and a pair of National Championship runoff events each year. The following are the only currently recognized official chapters of the 944 Cup National Series: In addition to providing for Regional Championships, the series held its inaugural national championship in September 2006 and a subsequent one in every year following. The yearly events invites all 944 Cup racers to compete on the same track over the course of 2–3 days to crown a National Champion.  Classes  The series includes 3 classes: Spec, Cup and Super Cup for the front-engine water cooled Porsches, including the various models of the 924S, 944, 944S, 944S2, 951, 951T and the 968. The Spec and Cup Class is designed for normally aspirated eight (8) valve front-engined Porsches. The Super Cup Class is designed primarily for higher horsepower cars such as the sixteen (16) valve normally aspirated and turbo equipped front-engine Porsches.  Rules  For each Class, allowed modifications for each category of car and corresponding minimum weights are described in detail in the rules. The 944 Cup rules also include by rule all PCA SP1, SP2, SP3, B, C, E and F class front engine Porsches, SCCA ITS 944's and all NASA 944 Specs cars are also eligible, along with many NASA GTS1 and GTS2 cars. Most front engine Porsches racing in PCA, SCCA and NASA are eligible. No 944 Cup membership or annual dues are required to race in the series. A current race competition license is required from PCA with two routes to obtaining a PCA Club Racing License. A current physical exam certification is required. 1) Via an existing, current full-competition license with current experience from a recognized road-racing sanctioning organization, including NASA, SCCA, POC, IMSA, USCR, BMWCCA or equivalent sanctioning body, or any vintage group which is a member of the Vintage Motorsport Council. Or, 2) the member must meet the race-track driving- experience requirements as defined in the licensing procedures in the Club Racing Rule Book and successfully complete the PCA Club Racing School which occurs the first day of every club race weekend.  History  The 944 Cup started with one class for normally aspirated / 8 valve 944s in 2002 at a race at Summit Point on June 22 with 16 racers entered. The race was held with NASA but as an independently owned and operated race series. The series had 6 rounds of racing that year. Designed as a place to race for nearly all front- engine Porsches, the series added a second class in 2004, Super Cup, for the more powerful 944s. Now racing in its 19th season, the series has hosted more than 500 individual races with over 2,500 racer entries. Along the way, it has visited some of the most storied tracks in motorsports history, a list that includes Virginia International Raceway, Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, Watkins Glen International Raceway and Daytona International Raceway. To create a safe and well-organized racing environment, the 944 Cup has partnered with many clubs and sanctioning bodies, including World Challenge, PCA, SCCA Club Racing, SCCA Pro Racing, Brian Redman's Intercontinental Events, Rennsport Reunion, Calabogie Motor Club, Autobahn Motor Club, NASCAR of Canada, NASA and EMRA. The 944 Cup now races all of its events with the Porsche Club of America. The first contact from PCA with the series regarding the prospect of adding 944 Cup classes for the club was in late 2005. As a result, PCA added two Cup classes in 2006: the SP2 representing the 944 Cup class and SP3 representing the 944 Super Cup class. The series Cup officially split from its original partner club NASA in 2008, when NASA decided to move their Nationals to Utah. Several other series have developed directly out of the Cup series by former Cup directors, including NASA's 944 Spec, NASA's GTS and the 944 Canada Challenge.

Formerly the Manor of Pulters, building was started c. 1390. The construction is of clunch with loose flint filling cavities in the lower part of the walls. There is 16th century decoration painted directly onto the stonework in one of the upper rooms. It was once owned by John Ward, son of Richard Ward, who was Lord Mayor of London for one month in 1484. After his death it passed to John Lambard, master of the Mercers' Company and alderman of London. The house was inhabited at one time by Cistercian monks of the Monastery of Pipewell Northants. The Drury and Andrews map of 1766 shows an L shaped building with three separate outbuildings with indication of an avenue and other plantings. The large spring fed pond to the south of the house is one of the sources of the river Rhee which is a major tributary of the river Cam. In the early part of the 20th century it was owned by Walter Sale who farmed but in the 1930s was compulsorily purchased by the county council who divided the land into four smallholdings each of about . The Sales remained tenants until 1949 by which time, the house having fallen into dereliction, it was sold to a banker who formed a syndicate of London professionals and artists (including the actor Peter Copley) who renovated it. Hinxworth Place was divided and sold during the 1960s and the larger part of the property is now the home and workplace of the sculptor John W Mills, a number of his works are displayed in the grounds. Haunting of Hinxworth Place Hinxworth Place has long been reputedly haunted. The main legend concerns the sound of thumps, screams, the sound of a baby crying, and of water coming from a pump - but this only takes place during stormy autumn evenings. The story behind the disembodied sounds is the accidental killing of a young boy by his nursemaid. Having dressed himself in a white sheet as a \\"ghost\\" for a joke, the child's terrified nurse screamed and struck at him with a poker, and he fell down a flight of stairs, the commotion awakening the family's baby. Servants attempted in vain to revive the boy by putting his head under the pump. There have also been tales of ghostly monks - sometimes a procession, sometimes alone - vanishing through a doorway long since bricked up.

In addition to its other responsibilities, the IMLS annually awards the National Medal for Museum and Library Service, the nation's highest award given for community service by libraries and museums. IMLS is located at 955 L'Enfant Plaza North, SW, Suite 4000, Washington, D.C. 20024-2135. History IMLS was established by the Museum and Library Services Act (MLSA) on September 30, 1996, which includes the Library Services and Technology Act and the Museum Services Act. This act was reauthorized in 2003 and again in 2010. The law combined the Institute of Museum Services, which had been in existence since 1976, and the Library Programs Office, which had been part of the Department of Education since 1956. Lawmakers at that time saw \\"great potential in an Institute that is focused on the combined roles that libraries and museums play in our community life.\\" As amended, MLSA authorizes IMLS to promote improvements in library services; to facilitate access to resources in libraries; to encourage resource sharing among libraries; to support museums in fulfilling their public service and educational roles; to encourage leadership and innovation to enhance museum services; to assist museums in the conservation of America's heritage; to support museums in achieving the highest standards of management and service to the public; and to support resource sharing among museums, libraries and other organizations. MLSA also authorizes IMLS to carry out and publish analyses of the impact of museum and library services. The act comes up for reauthorization every 5 years. Adjustment to the act have been made over time.Mjoseth, Jeaninne, Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences, 3rd ed, \\"Institute of Museum and Library Services\\", Aug 25, 2011 In April 2014, Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) recommended that the federal government not fund MLSA and \\"shift the federal agency’s responsibilities to the private sector in his 2015 fiscal year budget resolution\\" such as \\"funded at the state and local level and augmented significantly by charitable contributions from the private sector\\". Consolidation Following a proposal by President George W.

The consolidation took effect in early 2008.  Leadership  When Congress passed the Library Services and Technology Act in 1996, it moved library responsibilities out of the Department of Education and created the IMLS as new agency. The act stipulated that the agency maintain a rotating directorship starting with the former director of the Institute of Museum Services for a four-year term. In the fifth year, the directorship would pass to a representative from the field of library and information science.

National issues and priorities  * STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) – Libraries and museums are improving learning in science, technology, engineering and math, a national priority for US competitiveness. * Preservation, Conservation, and Care of Content and Collections – Libraries and museums care for collections that connect us to history, art, science and the natural world. The national initiative, Connecting to Collections, is an initiative to raise public awareness of the importance of caring for our treasures, and to underscore the fact that these collections are essential to the American story. * National Digital Platform – The national digital platform is a way of thinking about and approaching the digital capability and capacity of libraries and museums across the US.

Early career Marsh was born at Aylsham, Norfolk on 4 January 1862, and was educated at Brighton College and University College London. He worked for the Great Western Railway under William Dean becoming Assistant Works Manager at Swindon in 1888. In 1896 he became Chief Assistant Mechanical Engineer of the Great Northern Railway at Doncaster railway works under H.A. Ivatt, where he participated in the design of the Ivatt Atlantics. LB&SCR; Marsh succeeded R.J. Billinton as the Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Superintendent at Brighton Works on 23 November 1904.* Marsh's locomotive classes included two designs of Atlantic 4-4-2 (H1 Class and H2 Class), and four designs of 4-4-2T (I1, I2, I3, and I4). In 1910 he designed two 4-6-2T tank locomotives of the J1 and J2 classes. His least successful design was the LB&SCR; C3 class 0-6-0 freight locomotives. Marsh also rebuilt many of his predecessors' locomotives with larger boilers thereby creating the A1X, B2X, C2X, E4X, E5X and E6X classes. In 1907 he introduced an example of the Schmidt superheater on one of his LB&SCR; I3 class locomotives, with dramatically improved results. Whilst at Brighton he abolished the Stroudley yellow livery for passenger locomotives and removed the names from them. During Marsh's period in office Brighton railway works built up a serious backlog of locomotives awaiting repair, and by 1910 30% of the locomotive stock was unusable. Marsh received a lot of the blame for this situation although it was partly because the works was overwhelmed with work. Resignation and retirement Marsh was never popular within the workforce at Brighton. He resigned on the grounds of deteriorating health in July 1911, following accusations of a number of irregularities in his accounting. Shortly after his resignation he became a consulting engineer for the Rio Tinto Company until 1932. He died in Bath in May 1933.

For example, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Strasbourg, and the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem are exempt, being directly subject to the Holy See. See List of Catholic dioceses (structured view) for a list of exempt entities. Background Originally, according to canon law, all the residents of a diocese, as well as all diocesan institutions, were under the authority of the local bishop. Following complaints by monasteries that bishops treated them oppressively, they were taken under the protection of synods, princes and popes. Papal protection often evolved later into exemption from episcopal authority. From the 11th century onward, papal activity in the matter of Church reform has often been the source of exemptions. Extent and scope of exemption Eventually, not only individual monasteries, but also entire orders, were granted exemption from the authority of the local bishop. Exemptions were also granted to cathedral chapters, collegiate chapters, parishes, communities, ecclesiastical institutions, and even single individuals. In some cases, monasteries and churches which could document that from time immemorial they had never been subjected to the authority of a bishop could have their claim to exemption confirmed. Under these circumstances, the diocesan administration of the bishops was frequently crippled. Complaints and conflicts were frequent and councils were called upon to clarify and circumscribe the notion and scope of exemption. Some bishops gained exemption from the authority of their metropolitan (archbishop), either at their own request or by decision of the Holy See. However, those exempt bishops were required to choose an ecclesiastical province and attend the provincial synods.D. Bouix, Tractatus de concilio provinciali, Paris, 1862, p. 128. In the case of monasteries and churches, exemption is known as either passiva or activa, the latter being the most extensive. Abbots known canonically as proelati nullius cum territorio separato exercised quasi episcopal rights over a clearly defined territory entirely distinct from the diocese. There was disagreement as to whether or not such exempt abbots could be required to attend provincial synods as their presence might eventually jeopardize the right of exemption of their monasteries.D. Bouix, p. 144. The exemption enjoyed by female orders and religious houses was more restricted. The bishop or his representative presided over the election of the abbesses, prioresses, or superiors and they continued to have the right to visit canonically these houses. They also retained the right to supervise the observance of the clausura (cloister).

Synopsis A man had three sons and no daughter. He prayed for a daughter, even if she was a fox. His wife gave birth to a daughter, but when the girl was six, one of their cows would die every night. One night, he sent his oldest son to watch. The boy watched, and told him that his sister did it, by pulling the liver out of the cow and eating it. His father accused him of having fallen asleep and having a nightmare, and threw his son out. Next, the second son was sent to watch over the cows, and nothing happened until the moon was full again. Then, the sister struck, and the second son was also thrown out for reporting this. Following this, the youngest son was sent to watch; he claimed that their sister had gone to the outhouse, and that the cows must have died from seeing the moon. The older brothers wandered until they met a Buddhist monk, who sent them back with three magical bottles: a white one, a blue one, and a red one. Once they arrived, they found their sister living alone; she told them their parents and brother had died, and implored them to stay. Finally, she persuaded them to stay the night and somehow made a rich meal for them. In the night, the older brother was woken by the sounds of chewing. He rolled over, saw the meal, and realized that they had eaten corpses. His sister stood over his dead brother, eating his liver. She told him that she only needed one more to become a human. He fled, throwing the white bottle behind him, and it became a thicket of thorns. As a fox, she made her way through it. He threw the blue bottle behind him, and trapped her in a river, but as a fox, she swam ashore. He threw the red bottle behind, and she was trapped in fire.

The neighbourhood is considered a middle-income area, with an average family income of $47,890, an average dwelling value of $201,503 and a home ownership rate of 59.3%. According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $316,411. History W.W. Ashley Park The west half of Haultain was within the city limits when it incorporated; the land east of Clarence Avenue was annexed by the city between 1910 and 1919. A 1913 map shows that the present-day Haultain area overlaps two registered subdivisions of the day: the Broadway Addition in the west and Victoria Park in the east. Haultain School was opened in 1924, and named in honour of Sir Frederick Haultain, former Commissioner of Education and later first Premier of the Northwest Territories. The school's first principal was Miss Victoria Miners. In 1936, she received a Master of Education, making her the first woman in Saskatoon and only the second woman in Canada to earn that degree. When the school was first constructed, it was on the outskirts of Saskatoon. Many homes had no running water - it was delivered by water truck and residents could purchase pails of water. The school provided Monday morning baths in the school basement, and several homes still had outhouses until plumbing was established.

Design and development DH.94 Moth Minor Coupe at Portsmouth Airport in September 1954 The Moth Minor was designed as a low-wing monoplane to replace the biplane Moth series, and was intended to give similar performance with less power, and without the need for rigging of the biplane's tensioners and struts. Its predecessor was the DH.81 Swallow Moth monoplane of 1931, of which only one was built. The wooden prototype of the DH.94 was first flown by Geoffrey de Havilland on 22 June 1937 at Hatfield Aerodrome. Production started and nearly 100 examples had been built by the outbreak of the Second World War. With a selling price of only £575 the Moth Minor was popular with flying clubs keen to acquire modern monoplanes. Nine aircraft were specially built with hinged coupe tops instead of the normally open cockpit. As the factory at Hatfield was needed for the war effort, the drawings, jigs, components and unfinished aircraft were shipped to the de Havilland factory at Bankstown, Sydney. More than 40 aircraft were produced in Australia. Civil aircraft operated in the United Kingdom were commandeered for use by the Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm, and one example was used by the United States Army Air Corps. A large number of civil aircraft from the UK were sent to Australia, where they and a handful of locally built Australian civil aircraft were commandeered by the Royal Australian Air Force.ADF Serials list of RAAF Moth Minors. Retrieved: 11 December 2008 After the Second World War several Moth Minors continued to be flown by private owners in the United Kingdom. During World War two, de Havilland took over the small grass airfield at Witney (Oxfordshire) where they operated as a Civilian Repair Organisation on behalf of the British Government. They carried out complete overhauls to battle-damaged Spitfires and Hurricanes, plus any de Havilland types. An ex-Battle of Britain RAF pilot had been posted in to Witney to carry out the test flights as the aircraft were completed by the factory but he was de-mobbed as the war drew to an end, and test-flights carried out by de Havilland pilots who flew down to Witney from Hatfield. Frequently, Peter de Havilland would fly in to Witney in a DH.94 Moth Minor which was the coupe model and had a variable-pitch airscrew.

Margaret casually mentioned that her brother Donnie was learning guitar, so a decision was made to form a trio to enter the Folk Group competition at the Royal National Mòd. A friend from the Isle of Lewis, Donnie MacLean, was working with the BBC and introduced them to recordings of the little-known Melbost Bard, Murdo Macfarlane. Recognising the originality and catchiness of Murdo's songs, the trio took two of them to the Royal National Mòd in Stirling in October 1971, where they won the Folk group competition and created an immediate stir with their professional performance and novel songs. The following year they performed another of Murdo's songs (Mi le m' Uillinn) and won the New Song competition at the Pan-Celtic Festival in Killarney, Ireland, introducing themselves on to the international stage. This led to engagements throughout the Celtic Language speaking world: in England, Canada, Wales and Brittany. The group recorded three albums for the Beltona Sword label, a branch of Decca Records - The Great Gaelic Sound of Na h-Òganaich (1972), Gael Force Three (1973) and Scot-Free (1975). In 1976 Na h-Òganaich were invited to participate in an extended tour of the USA. At that time Noel was working as a college lecturer and unable to take part, so Margaret and Donnie proceeded to tour, and later perform back in the UK, as a duo with backing musicians. The original group has reformed on several occasions since then on a one-off basis, notably at Fèis nan Còisir in Stornoway and at Celtic Connections in Glasgow (2007). Margaret has continued to sing professionally with accordionist Billy Anderson, while Donnie in the 1980s became a popular TV performer and presenter with the children's Gaelic TV programme Dotaman on BBC Scotland. Noel has been living and working in education on the Isle of Lewis since 1978.

Mithridates was one of the sons born to King Mithridates VI of Pontus from his mistress, the Galatian Princess Adobogiona the Elder. He also had a full-blooded sister called Adobogiona the Younger. The Pontic prince was of Persian, Macedonian and Galatian ancestry. His father sent Mithridates to Pergamon to be educated, where he became a leading citizen of that city. Mithridates was a tetrarch over the Trocmi tribe. In the winter of 48/47 BC, Caesar was under siege in Alexandria by the armies of Achillas, guardian and general for King Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator. Mithridates raised an army and came to Caesar’s relief. In the aftermath of the Battle of Zela, Caesar made him king of the Bosporan Kingdom, by commanding him to declare war on his niece Dynamis and her husband Asander (who were then the ruling monarchs) to seize the kingship for himself. Dynamis and Asander were defeated by Mithridates and his army, and Mithridates became King of the Bosporus. However, after Caesar’s death in 44 BC, the Bosporan Kingdom was restored to Dynamis and Asander by Caesar’s great nephew and heir, Octavian (future Roman Emperor Augustus). Sometime after Mithridates abdicated, he died. Mithridates was portrayed by Furio Meniconi in the 1963 film Cleopatra.

One example for this is 1,1-diethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazine, or diethylamine dinitric oxide. These compounds are unusual in having three sequential nitrogen atoms: an amine functional group, a bridging NO− group, and a terminal nitrosyl group. In contact with water, these compounds release NO (nitric oxide). pH-dependent decomposition of NONOates Most NONOates are stable in alkaline solution above pH 8.0 (e. g. 10 mM NaOH) and can be stored at −20 °C in this way for the short term. To generate NO from NONOates, the pH is lowered accordingly. Typically, a dilution of the stock NONOate solution is made in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.4; tris buffers can also be used) and incubated at room temperature for the desired time to allow NO to accumulate in solution. This is often visible as bubbles at high NONOate concentrations. Incubation time is important, since the different NONOates have different half-lives (t½) in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. For example, the half-life of MAHMA NONOate under these conditions is ~3.5 minutes, whilst the t½ of DPTA NONOate is 300 minutes. This is often useful in biological systems, where a combination of different NONOates can be used to give a sustained release of nitric oxide. At pH 5.0, most NONOates are considered to decompose almost instantaneously.

First proposed in 1990 by Foot and Lew, it assumes that leptons as well as quarks come in three \\"colors\\". Such theory may reproduce the Standard Model at low energies, and hence quark–lepton symmetry may be realized in nature.  Possible evidence for QLC  Recent neutrino experiments confirm that the Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata matrix UPMNS contains large mixing angles. For example, atmospheric measurements of particle decay yield ≈ 45°, while solar experiments yield ≈ 34°. These results should be compared with which is small, and with the quark mixing angles in the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix UCKM. The disparity that nature indicates between quark and lepton mixing angles has been viewed in terms of a \\"quark–lepton complementarity\\" which can be expressed in the relations : \\\\theta_{12}^{PMNS}+\\\\theta_{12}^{CKM} \\\\approx 45^\\\\circ \\\\ , : \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\theta_{23}^{PMNS}+\\\\theta_{23}^{CKM} \\\\approx 45^\\\\circ \\\\ . Possible consequences of QLC have been investigated in the literature and in particular a simple correspondence between the PMNS and CKM matrices have been proposed and analyzed in terms of a correlation matrix. The correlation matrix VM is simply defined as the product of the CKM and PMNS matrices: :V_\\\\mathrm{M}=U_\\\\mathrm{CKM} \\\\cdot U_\\\\mathrm{PMNS} \\\\ , Unitarity implies: :U_\\\\mathrm{PMNS}=U^{\\\\dagger}_\\\\mathrm{CKM}V_\\\\mathrm{M} \\\\ .  Open questions  One may ask where do the large lepton mixings come from? Is this information implicit in the form of the V_M matrix? This question has been widely investigated in the literature, but its answer is still open. Furthermore, in some Grand Unification Theories (GUTs) the direct QLC correlation between the CKM and the PMNS mixing matrix can be obtained. In this class of models, the V_M matrix is determined by the heavy Majorana neutrino mass matrix. Despite the naive relations between the PMNS and CKM angles, a detailed analysis shows that the correlation matrix is phenomenologically compatible with a tribimaximal pattern, and only marginally with a bimaximal pattern. It is possible to include bimaximal forms of the correlation matrix V_M in models with renormalization effects that are relevant, however, only in particular cases with \\\\tan \\\\beta > 40 and with quasi-degenerate neutrino masses.

First mentioned in an 860 deed, it is known as the oldest town in Carinthia. Geography=Location Friesach covers an area of 120.83 km2 and its mean elevation is 631 meters above sea level. It is located in northern Carinthia near the border with Styria, about north of its capital Klagenfurt. Municipal arrangement Friesach is divided into the following Katastralgemeinden: Friesach, St. Salvator and Zeltschach. It can be further divided into Friesach proper and the villages and hamlets of Dobritsch, Dörfl, Engelsdorf, Gaisberg, Grafendorf, Guldendorf, Gundersdorf, Gunzenberg, Gwerz, Harold, Hartmannsdorf, Hundsdorf, Ingolsthal, Judendorf, Kräuping, Leimersberg, Mayerhofen, Moserwinkl, Oberdorf I, Oberdorf II, Olsa, Pabenberg, Reisenberg, Roßbach, Sattelbogen, Schratzbach, Schwall, Silbermann, St. Johann, St. Salvator, St. Stefan, Staudachhof, Stegsdorf, Timrian, Wagendorf, Wels, Wiegen, Wiesen, Zeltschach, Zeltschachberg, Zienitzen, Zmuck. History In 860 King Louis the German of East Francia donated the lands of the estate ad Friesah - derived from Slavic Breza (birch) - in the Bavarian March of Carinthia (Carantania) to Archbishop Adalwin of Salzburg. From about 740 Bavarians had crossed the Central Eastern Alps and settled among the Slavic Carantanians. Petersberg Castle After the formation of the Duchy of Carinthia in 976, Friesach remained a southern Salzburg exclusive and a strategically important outpost. About 1076 Archbishop Gebhard of Salzburg, a follower of Pope Gregory VII in the Investiture Controversy, had the Petersberg fortress erected above the town in order to prevent Emperor Henry IV from crossing the Alps. The archbishop also had fierce enemies in the Carinthian ducal House of Sponheim, who after his deposition made several attempts to take possession of Friesach. Constant attacks by Duke Engelbert were finally repelled in 1124. In 1149 King Conrad III of Germany stayed at the castle on his way back from the Second Crusade, as did Richard the Lionheart returning from the Third Crusade in 1192, attempting to elude the guards of Duke Leopold V of Austria. Town fortification The settlement of Friesach beneath Petersberg Castle received town privileges in 1215. During the Middle Ages, it was a principal market town and commercial centre due to an important trade route from Vienna to Venice that ran through the city. The town flourished when Archbishop Eberhard II of Regensberg (1200-1246) made it the second largest city in the Archdiocese of Salzburg and the most important town in Carinthia. From local silver resources it even minted its own currency called the Friesacher Pfennig or Frizatik, widely used within the Austrian and Hungarian lands in the 12th century. The town gained in regional importance, and by the 13th century the Friesach pfennig was the standard coin used in the eastern Alps - circulated even as far as Croatia.Freed, John B. \\"Medieval German Social History\\". Central European History. 25:1 (1992). 7. The importance of the town diminished with the rise of the House of Habsburg, Carinthian dukes since 1335. The fortress, however, continued to be an important power basis of the Salzburg prince-archbishops throughout the Middle Ages, once again enlarged and strengthened by Leonhard von Keutschach from 1495 onwards. It nevertheless belonged to Salzburg until the secularisation of the archbishopric in 1803, when Friesach finally fell to Carinthia. Demographics At the 2001 census Friesach had 5,335 inhabitants. Of that, 89.8% are Roman Catholic, 2.6% are Protestant and 1.5% are Muslims. 4.8% of the population is non-religious.

The services, including both ambulance and paramedic services, may be provided directly by the province, contracted to a private provider, or delegated to local governments, which may in turn create service delivery arrangements with municipal departments, hospitals or private providers. The approach, and the standards, vary considerably between provinces and territories. Organization=Rail Ambulances A rail ambulance is a vehicle used for medical transportation services on railway lines. The first rail ambulance was set up in 1920, in order to enable injured people to be transported to the nearest hospital, was set up in the coalmining community of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. The car ran between #3 and #7 mines and Town of Sydney Mines. It was discontinued in 1922.https://scontent- lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12670362_1322428467774188_1335651579109790345_n.jpg?oh=4375a860255dc72ffb91ecf87e209b98&oe;=57E138CD Land Ambulance A land ambulance in Montreal Responsibility for emergency medical services (EMS), as a part of health care in general, lies with the provinces and territories of Canada. With the exceptions of British Columbia and Alberta, which operate their EMS services directly, the method used for service delivery varies between jurisdictions. Typically, the provincial/territorial government provides enabling legislation, technical standards, accreditation or licensing, and oversight to a variety of operators, including municipalities, hospitals, and private companies. Municipalities or hospitals may also, in turn, elect to provide EMS service directly, as a branch of another municipal department, such as the fire department or health department, or may contract out this responsibility to a private company. The approaches used for service delivery are governed by what is permitted under the legislation of the individual province or territory, or under the by-laws of a municipality that has accepted responsibility for EMS service. Provincial governments may also, as in the case of the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, contract directly with a single private company, in these cases Medavie Health Services, to provide province-wide services. Air Ambulance Ontario Air Ambulance operated by Ornge. Canadian provinces are also served by air ambulance services. These arrangements may come in a variety of forms, including direct service provision, contracts between private companies and the provincial government, or \\"brokerage\\" arrangements in which one private company takes the lead on service provision, perhaps even operating some of their own aircraft and providing dispatch services, but subcontracting many of the operations to smaller air charter services. In some cases, the inter-facility transport of high-acuity patients may be a mix of air-based and ground-based resources. Canada is a vast country, and its sheer size dictates that in many cases a helicopter-based air ambulance service is impractical as the distances required exceed the flight range of the aircraft. For this reason, the use of fixed wing aircraft is commonplace. In some jurisdictions not all air ambulance calls are emergencies, since distances to tertiary care centres mean that some patients with lower-acuity medical conditions are also flown. Standards=Vehicles Ottawa Rehab Unit Individual provinces and territories typically specify, generally through legislation and regulations, the specifications and types of vehicles to be used in EMS. These vehicles include ambulances, but may also include rapid response vehicles (sometimes called \\"fly-cars\\"), and specialized emergency support units, such as equipment vehicles and mass-casualty transport vehicles. Each province or territory, and also the Canadian military, has its own unique ambulance specifications. Individual provinces or territories may also specify types of mandatory equipment in those vehicles, including medical equipment. Ambulances type in Canada are based on United States federal KKK-1822 Standards requirements: * Type I Ambulances are based on the chassis-cabs of light duty pickup-trucks. * Type II Ambulances are based on modern passenger/cargo vans. * Type III Ambulances are based on chassis-cabs of light duty vans. Bus-based and air ambulances are not based on these standards. Buses are mostly for ambulatory transfer only and offer less advanced care services. Staffing and training Individual provinces and territories also typically specify required levels of mandatory staff training. British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Yukon are served by highly educated paramedics with advanced skills. Other jurisdictions have not yet reached these levels, and some jurisdictions have introduced, or are considering introducing, critical care paramedics. > Progress varies, driven primarily by public demand, acceptance by the medical community, and funding. A great deal of the recent advancement in standards of care and procedures has been driven by formal outcome-based research and clinical trials, such as the groundbreaking research work on the management of S-T segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI), undertaken in cooperation with the Ottawa Paramedic Service. Some paramedics undertake their own formal research projects or collaborate with other researchers in the medical community, leading to publication (as with the preceding two references, both of which had paramedics in lead investigator roles). In Ontario, paramedics are certified to administer symptom relief medications under a base hospital physician's license. The Ministry of Health and Long Term Care has established a minimum standard of care for the province, but base hospitals can add medications at their discretion. The number and type of medications beyond the minimum standard also varies with the paramedic scope of practice (primary, advanced or critical care). Response times Urban areas such as Toronto set standards according to percentiles. In Toronto, the standard is 8 minutes and 59 seconds or less 90 percent of the time on AMPDS triaged Delta and Echo calls. There is no jurisdiction in Canada that is currently reporting successful achievement of this response time standard, and services cite a variety of reasons for this failure, but continue to aspire to the standard. This approach to response time monitoring is accepted in most urban areas of the country, but there are some jurisdictions that set a second standard for rural areas (the majority of the country). Such standards vary from one jurisdiction to the next. Additionally, there are jurisdictions that do not set specific response time objectives, instead simply reporting average response times for emergency calls. Towards national standards There are currently major initiatives for improved standardization of staff training underway in Canadian EMS. The Paramedic Association of Canada has produced the National Occupational Competency Profile (NOCP), and several provinces are working toward meeting these standards. Provinces and territories are also responsible for standards with respect to the dispatching of EMS resources, and some jurisdictions are measuring performance, benchmarking and setting standards. In addition, initiatives by the Paramedic Chiefs of Canada organization are working towards improved interoperability and a best practice approach to the overall management of EMS systems. Several provinces have started testing using the COPR (Canadian Organization of Paramedic Regulators) licensing exam for both PCP and ACP levels. As of March 2018, these include British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, P.E.I., and Newfoundland and Labrador. Funding and costs EMS services in Canada are generally funded, at least in part, and to varying degrees, by the Ministry of Health or Health Department of the province or territory in which they operate. Paramedics and ambulance services are not mentioned in the Canada Health Act, and are therefore not an insured service. Provinces may choose to subsidize some of the cost, usually just for patients with valid provincial health cards. Health insurance in Canada is universal and publicly funded, so the cost of emergency ambulance services is covered to some degree. The degree to which individual use of EMS is subsidized by provincial health insurance varies by province, and may be supplemented either by partial fees for service, or by the property tax revenues of municipalities operating such services. In some jurisdictions, funding is at 100 per cent, and occurs without the patient being aware of its existence. Other jurisdictions fund at varying levels, but may require payment up front. In most cases this is later reimbursed. This may be particularly true of out of jurisdiction services, with an individual from one province who requires EMS service in another province being required to pay for that service and then submit the receipt to their own provincial health insurance scheme for reimbursement. In some jurisdictions, such as Ontario, a deterrent fee scheme is used to discourage the medically unnecessary use of EMS by the public. In such cases, the provincial health insurance scheme pays the majority of the cost of EMS service (around 80 per cent) for medically necessary EMS service, but when a physician decides that the service was not medically necessary, they can cause the patient to pay the full, uninsured amount of the charge, with the patient receiving a bill for the additional deterrent fee at some point after the emergency is over. Within Ontario, for example, such deterrent billing occurs through the receiving hospital, despite the fact that the hospital neither provides nor oversees EMS in most cases. Private transport services St John Ambulance, a common private transport service in Canada In addition to regular EMS, many jurisdictions also operate non-emergency patient transport services. In many jurisdictions, there are also companies who specialize in non-emergency patient transfers. Such companies have their own vehicles, which are similar to ambulances and carry some similar patient care equipment. These services can relieve the workload on public EMS through the elimination of some, or most, of the non-emergency transfer volume, and some provide service to the public that is of the highest standard. In many cases, such services are small private businesses, using second-hand ambulances which have been retired from public EMS service, while others use vehicles expressly built for their purposes. There has, however, been some controversy, in some jurisdictions, with respect to the operating procedures of some (but not all) of these services. In some cases, the vehicles are often made to look as much like EMS ambulances as possible, even retaining emergency lights and sirens (which they are forbidden by law to use), and incorporating the word \\"paramedic\\" (this term is not protected in Canada yet), variations on \\"EMS\\" (in some cases, \\"event medical services\\") or spelling variations of \\"ambulance\\", such as \\"ambu-lans\\", or using the Star of Life logo on their vehicle markings. These services are not generally licensed, or required to meet any recognized standard. These services generally attempt to recruit staff who meet provincial EMS qualification standards, but are under no legal obligation to do so. Such services are not covered by provincial health insurance, operate on a fee-for-service basis, and are not considered to be a legitimate part of mainstream EMS. Other EMS Operations in Canada EMS services are publicly operated, and many by the provincial ministry of health (mostly since the 1970s). In Ontario services were devolved to local municipalities in the 1990s. *Alberta Health Services *British Columbia Ambulance Service *List of EMS Services in Ontario **Ottawa Paramedic Service **Region of Waterloo EMS **Toronto Paramedic Services **York Region EMS *Urgences-santé (Montreal region) *New Brunswick Emergency Medical Services (Province of New Brunswick) *Emergency Health Services (Province of Nova Scotia) *Island EMS (Province of Prince Edward Island) See also *Air ambulance *Emergency Medical Dispatcher *Paramedics in Canada *9-1-1 ReferencesExternal links *Paramedic Association of Canada *Ambulance Paramedics of B.C. *Ontario Paramedic Association *Saskatchewan College of Paramedics *Alberta College of Paramedics *Manitoba Paramedic Association *Quebec Paramedic Association (in French) *Paramedic Association of New Brunswick *Nova Scotia Paramedic Society *Paramedic Association of Newfoundland and Labrador *Paramedic Association of Prince Edward Island * Ottawa Paramedic Service *Toronto Paramedic Association ","title":"Emergency medical services in Canada"},{"id":"9581350","text":"Clube Desportivo Arrifanense is a Portuguese football club from Arrifana, Santa Maria da Feira.

The central organizations that provide these services are known as a SAMU, which stands for Service d'Aide Médicale Urgente (Urgent Medical Aid Service). Local SAMU organisations operate the control rooms that answer emergency calls and dispatch medical responders. They also operate the SMUR (Service Mobile d'Urgence et Réanimation – Mobile Emergency and Resuscitation Service), which refers to the ambulances and response vehicles that provide advanced medical care. Other ambulances and response vehicles are provided by the fire services and private ambulance services. Organization=SAMU organizations The term SAMU may refer to either the overall integrated emergency medical service of France, or to a local organisation that coordinates the service. A law in 1986 defined SAMU organizations as hospital-based services providing permanent telephone support, choosing and dispatching the proper response for a phone call request. The service is organized based on the departments of France. Each department has a hospital-based SAMU organisation which is named with the department's unique two-digit number code. For example, SAMU 06 covers Alpes- Maritimes (including Nice) while SAMU 75 covers Paris. Additionally, two SAMU have specific tasks: * The Paris SAMU is responsible for providing service to high-speed trains (TGV) and Air France aircraft, while in flight. * The Toulouse SAMU is responsible for providing service to ships at sea. In addition to the mainland French departments, SAMU also operates in most of the offshore North and South American Départements, such as Guadeloupe (SAMU 971), Martinique, Guyane or Pacific and Indian French Islands (Tahiti Reunion). Operations The central component of SAMU is the dispatch centre where a team of physicians and assistants answer calls, triage the patients' complaints and respond to them. Their options include: *Dispatching an ambulance or response vehicle. *Directing the patient to present themselves at a place of care, such as a primary care clinic or hospital. *Offering care advice over the telephone. This means that the SAMU controls a variety of resources within a community from general practitioners to hospital intensive care services. Due to the triage (called medical regulation) and use of alternative options, only about 65% of calls to SAMU result in an ambulance being sent. Current response time targets are for the responder to arrive at the scene within 10 minutes for 80% of responses, and within 15 minutes for 95% of responses. Ambulance provision While the term ambulance is generally used in France for any type of ambulance, not all are officially called ambulances. For example, fire service ambulances are usually referred to as a VSAV (Rescue and Casualty Assistance Vehicle). The main three providers of ambulances are the SMUR service, fire services and private providers. SMUR provides the more advanced emergency treatment, though all three providers can transport patients. Fire service ambulances have a crew of 3 or 4, while SMUR and private company ambulances have a crew of 2 or 3. The three types providers have different specialities. Fire service ambulance have training to provide first aid to major trauma cases, and their crews may also carry out rescues such as vehicle extrication.French fire service performing a vehicle extrication during a demonstration in 2007 Not all ambulances follow the European standard colour scheme for ambulances (CEN 1789), which was published by the European Committee for Standards., Most private company ambulances are white. The fire service ambulance are red but since 2010 they have often had yellow markings added. Private ambulance services Private Basic Ambulance on the Tour de France in Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse, France Private companies are more likely to be sent to non-emergency and low-priority calls. Their vehicles are often not officially designated as an \\"ambulance\\"; relying instead on the more general term \\"light vehicle adapted to patient transport.\\" Fire department services French fire service in Strasbourg, France Local fire departments also respond to medical calls, and can send an ambulance, a multi-purpose response vehicle or even a fire apparatus. Here, the cross-trained firefighters will provide on scene care and transport for injuries or illness, but are usually backed up by a SMUR unit for more serious or complex cases. Although they also transport casualties and are, in any practical sense, ambulances, their vehicles are instead called a VSAV (véhicule de secours et d'assistance aux victimes, rescue and casualty assistance vehicle). Volunteer-staffed ambulances may be called a VPS (véhicules de premiers secours, first aid vehicle). The VSAV and VPS are considered to be means of bringing rescue workers and equipment onsite, with the evacuation of patients being only the logical result of the response, but not the primary duty of these response resources. SMUR Emergency vehicles of Orléans SMUR SAMU helicoptered MICU AgustaWestland AW109 SMUR (Service Mobile d'Urgence et Reanimation, Mobile Emergency and Resuscitation Service) units are advanced medical responders which are operated by the SAMU organisation. They are typically labelled as \\"SAMU\\", though that term actually refers to either the overall system or the local EMS organization that the SMUR units are part of. The French philosophy on emergency medical care is to provide a higher level of care at the scene of the incident, and so SMUR units are staffed by a qualified physician along with a nurse and/or emergency medical technician. This contrasts with systems in other parts of the world, notably English-speaking countries, where care on scene is conducted primarily by paramedics or emergency medical technicians, with physicians only becoming involved on scene at the most complex or large scale incidents. The result is that a SMUR unit will typically spend a long time on scene compared with a paramedic ambulance in a different system, as the physician may conduct a full set of observations, examinations and interventions before removal to hospital. Despite being hospital-based, SMUR units may choose to transport a patient to an alternative hospital if the latter is better suited to treating the patient. Hospital standards for SAMU French hospitals (whether publicly or privately run) must operate an emergency department (service spécialisé d'accueil et de traitement des urgences) only if it is capable of treating the common trauma and illness conditions that are likely to present. This normally includes a resuscitation unit, general and internal medicine, cardio-vascular medicine, pediatrics, anesthesiology-resuscitation, orthopedic surgery and oncology, including obstetrics. The exception would be for specialised units, which only admit specific pathologies or specific types of patients (e.g. pediatrics). These units are termed \\"pôle spécialisé d'accueil et de traitement des urgences\\". The hospital must have two operating rooms (and a recovery room) with personnel on duty that allow operation at any time, as well as support services that can perform additional examination or analysis at any time, such as medical imaging (radiography, medical ultrasonography, CAT Scanners, haematology, toxicology laboratory etc.). The specialized service is managed by an emergency physician. An emergency physician must always be \\"on-call\\" and a specialized physician can be called at any time. In addition the team must have two nurses, care assistants (and possibly child care assistants), a social worker and a receptionist, with all of them having received specific education for dealing with emergency cases. The service is organized in three zones: * a reception zone, * a zone for examination and treatment (including intensive treatment). * a zone for monitoring over short duration (patients waiting to go out or for a transfer to another service). Most services also have a massive crowd room that are designed to allow care of a large number of patients, outside of the normal levels of presenting patients. These \\"plan blanc\\" units are designed to cope with major incidents or epidemics. A local SAMU organisation carries out the day to day monitoring of response vehicles and hospital emergency departments, and coordinates with the SAMU organisations of the neighbouring departments. It also acts as the regional Medical Emergency Response Center (MERC).Comparable to a system used in some USA States like Oklahoma. See Callaway p 137-138 in Hogan Burstein Disaster Medicine Lippincott Ed.2007 In the case of disaster, they form a network that can plan the first emergency phase planned response, called \\"Plans blancs\\", and of secondary ground or aerial transport if necessary. Emergency medicine speciality Emergency medicine in hospitals has only recently been recognized as a medical specialty in France, and pre-hospital care is currently struggling to be recognized as a sub-specialty. In the meantime, many SMUR/MICU physicians are actually in training for other specialties, such as anesthesia, and the system relies on General Practitioners and physicians from other specialties 'filling the gap' when emergency physicians are not available. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the physicians staffing the SMUR units are among the lowest-paid in Europe. Although salaries have recently improved somewhat, in 2002 it was reported that these physicians who are, for the most part, full-time employees of public hospitals, had a starting salary of only €1300 (£833; $1278) per month. This economic situation has resulted in high turnover and some difficulty in staffing positions. However, the recognition of emergency medicine as an in-hospital specialty in France and elsewhere in Europe is likely to result in the evolution of that system towards more comprehensive in-hospital emergency services. This will ultimately, in turn, result in physicians becoming less likely to respond to emergencies outside the hospital, though they are still expected to play a major role in the immediate future. Since 1986, fire department-based rescue ambulances have had the option of providing resuscitation service (reanimation) using specially- trained nurses. operating on protocols Public access France, along with the rest of the continental European Union uses the emergency telephone number available across all members 112, which gives access to police, fire and ambulance services. However, the legacy emergency number of \\"15\\" for SAMU and \\"18\\" for fire department VSAV are still in use. Funding and costs The use of SAMU is free, but abuse is punishable by law. In France, the 100 or so SAMUs (one for each Département) are all operated by public hospitals. Public hospitals (unlike private hospitals, and France has both) receive government funding. France operates on a system of universal health care. Patients have freedom to choose physicians, hospitals etc., and there are prices set for each type of service. When operating in the public system, patients are asked to co-pay a portion of the cost for each type of care that they receive. To illustrate, a patient requiring hospitalization is liable for 20 percent of costs for the first month, and nothing thereafter. What this means in terms of funding is that the SAMUs and their SMUR response teams are funded by the government, by means of the hospital funding scheme. They do charge a fee for service, and for a typical patient, 65% of this cost will be covered by the government health insurance scheme and the balance covered by optional additional private insurance. By French law, in an emergency any French hospital or SAMU must treat any patient, regardless of their ability to pay. As a measure against system abuse, the SAMU physician may refuse to sign the patient's \\"treatment certificate\\", resulting in the patient being liable for the full cost of services provided, although in practice, this is rarely done. Most French citizens also carry private health insurance in order to cover all co-payment charges. In some circumstances, particularly on low-priority calls, patients being transported to hospital may be asked to pay for service in advance, and then seek reimbursement from the government insurance scheme or their private insurance. Although not regarded as ambulances in France, fire department ambulances, when used, may provide transportation to hospital, albeit with a considerable charge. All requests for ambulance service are processed by the local SAMU, which will determine what type of assistance and transportation resources are sent; the patient has no choice in the matter when it is an Intensive Urgent Care Need.

They are distinct from other mobile phones in that they make use of two cellular networks instead of a single one. PowerSource phones currently include the ic402, ic502, ic602 and ic902, all manufactured by Motorola and available only through Sprint-Nextel in the United States.  History  Upon the merger of Sprint PCS and Nextel Communications in 2005, the combined company faced significant integration challenges. Unlike some other mergers in the wireless arena, Sprint PCS and Nextel employed different air-interface technologies for their networks, making them incompatible. Sprint used Qualcomm's proprietary CDMA format, which they operated in the 1900 MHz band, while Nextel used Motorola's iDEN system, which they deployed at 800 MHz. This meant that the combined company had two distinct customer bases with two types of phones; a Nextel user could not use their phone on the Sprint PCS network, and vice versa. There was an additional problem facing the newly combined company: prior to the merger, Nextel Communications had been issued a government mandate to reduce interference caused by its cellular network with public safety radio systems. It was to do so via a process termed \\"re-banding.\\" As a side effect of this \\"re-banding,\\" however, Nextel's iDEN network would lose valuable 800 MHz spectrum, causing the network to face significant capacity challenges. Simultaneously, Boost Mobile, a prepaid MVNO that operated on Nextel's network, was beginning to skyrocket in popularity, placing an even greater burden on the iDEN system. This eventually manifested itself in a decrease in Nextel customers' call quality in certain markets—dropped calls, blocked calls, and bad voice quality all began to be reported in various cities in 2006. To remedy this problem, Sprint-Nextel sought to move as much of its customers' voice traffic (phone call volume) as it could from the Nextel network to the higher-capacity Sprint network. The challenge that arose then, however, was how to keep the Nextel customer base happy; Nextel had become famous in the United States for its walkie-talkie feature (called Direct Connect), a feature that at the time could not be replicated on the Sprint (or any other) network. The result was the PowerSource series of phones. Originally called \\"hybrids,\\" these devices were aggressively marketed to Nextel customers in so-called \\"red markets\\" (areas of high Nextel network congestion) beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006.  Operation  PowerSource phones used the Sprint network for interconnect (regular voice phone calls) and the Nextel network for walkie-talkie calls. They do this through the implementation of two radios in each unit—a 1900 MHz CDMA radio for Sprint, and an 800 MHz iDEN radio for Nextel. Since the more capacity- hungry interconnect (phone) calls are routed through the higher-capacity Sprint network, these phones in mass deployment are expected to reduce the overall burden on the Nextel network. Since data services (such as web browsing and text messaging) are routed through the Sprint PCS network, they perform faster (up to 144 kbit/s) than on the Nextel National Network (up to 56 kbit/s). Also, since interconnect and walkie-talkie calls use different networks, it is possible to receive a walkie-talkie alert while on a regular voice call—something not possible on a traditional Nextel phone. Maintaining two active radios in a single handset is a power-intensive task, and some users have complained about lack of battery endurance in the ic402/ic502 models. Some users report Sprint-Nextel acknowledges the problem and has even offered free car chargers as a result. Additionally, because Motorola did not include the capability for 800 MHz roaming in the handset, the usable coverage area for a PowerSource phone is significantly less than that of a comparable Sprint PCS phone. Also, since the PowerSource series does not allow voice calling over the iDEN network, a customer with good Nextel coverage but no Sprint coverage would only be able to use the walkie-talkie feature. Phone selection was once a stumbling point, with the ic402 and ic502 being the only two models available; both are basic units that lack cameras, high-speed data, or any similar amenities. This shortcoming has now been eliminated with the availability of the ic902, a high-end model, which is the first powersource phone with high-speed 3G data (EVDO), a 2-megapixel camera and an external SD card storage. The ic902 also offers bluetooth and MP3 capabilities. In addition, the ic602 is coming out 9/2/07 and it is described as a Mid Tier Powersource clamshell built to Mil spec 810F with Vision Data services and a VGA camera.

In most circumstances, emergency ambulance service is organized by a local Health Trust, and may be operated directly, or contracted to private providers, such as national transportation companies, for which ambulances are just a part of their business operations. Private organisations are also used frequently by the police in search & rescue operations. Organization=Land ambulance Land ambulance service provision is funded by the national government, and provided by means of one of the four Regional Health Authorities (Southern and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, Southern Norway Regional Health Authority, Western Norway Regional Health Authority, and Northern Norway Regional Health Authority) which provide most healthcare in Norway. Services may be provided directly by the Trust or its member hospitals, but are typically outsourced. In many locations in Norway, the provision of land ambulance service is contracted to private operators, most typically large scale transportation companies operating a variety of types of service. Namsos Trafikkselskap (NTS) is an example of a private company participating in this type of arrangement for service delivery. While the majority of such arrangements are currently with Norwegian-based companies, this is changing, and international companies, such as Falck are beginning to contract for services in some areas. Such services may operate 24 hours per day in larger centers, but in remote and rural locations are still frequently staffed by 'on-call' personnel after normal business hours. Even in areas with directly operated emergency ambulances, non-emergency transportation is more likely to be conducted by commercial transportation companies. Norway currently operates on the Franco-German model of EMS care, with some limitations on the permitted skills of EMS personnel, and physician response to emergencies being quite commonplace.

This is the old appearance Air ambulance As Norway has a very scattered population with many small towns and villages that are located far from hospitals and treatment centers, land ambulances are supplemented by both helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. These are organized nationally, under the title Norwegian Air Ambulance. Participants in the air ambulance scheme include the Royal Norwegian Air Force 330 Squadron, and also one privately owned company (Lufttransport) and one not-for-profit foundation (Norsk Luftambulanse). The relationship with the private company and the foundation are contractual, and currently extend to 2014.

Such services may be provided directly, or may be contracted out to a larger marine transportation company. Water ambulances may be found in Oslo and Stavanger, among other locations. Standards=Staffing Ambulances are usually staffed by two emergency medical technicians. Ambulances in Norway have traditionally been manned by EMTs with only 2 or 3 month courses in acute emergency medicine, however, an increasing focus on the importance of prehospital medicine has resulted in such courses being phased out, in favor of a far more comprehensive 2+2 year education process. At a national level, effort is being made to reduce the number of ambulances staffed by personnel on home call, but this arrangement still occurs fairly frequently in rural areas. Training EMTs newly entering the field are now recommended to have two years of training at Vocational school followed by two-year internships. This program has been offered since 2003, and is inspired by American EMS training. The system currently has individuals working at the Basic, Intermediate and Advanced levels, and for vehicles providing ALS service, the crew configuration is typically 1-ILS, 1-ALS. Those EMTs already working in the field, and with sufficient experience, are permitted to 'fast track' the new training, completing a degree with the equivalent of a single year of full-time education. Only those EMTs completing this education process are permitted to use the title \\"Paramedic\\". While the program is not yet mandatory on a national level, it is considered to be a prerequisite for employment in the Oslo region. Norway has also come up with the proposal to add qualified nurses on the ambulances, as other countries in Europe have done within its system. Vehicles Norwegian ambulances are required to comply with the European Union standard CEN 1789 (types A-C) for ambulances, as issued by the European Committee for Standards., These standards include the types of vehicles used, their design, performance, testing, basic equipment, and markings or livery. As with all European Standards, compliance is voluntary, but has been mandated by the Norwegian government. Response time The national goal is that any citizen should not have to wait more than 12 minutes (in urban areas) or 20 minutes (in sparsely populated areas) for emergency services. This goal is not yet being achieved consistently.St.meld. nr. 43 (1999 - 2000). Om akuttmedisinsk beredskap.

He moved to the Western United States in the early 1940s.Biography at the West Coast Stock Car Hall of Fame, Retrieved November 22, 2007 He had a successful short track racing career in Southern California, primarily driving for owner Floyd Johnson. Cook made 39 starts in the Nextel Cup series from 1954 through 1970. Most of Cook's starts were in West Coast races during the time the races counted for both Nextel Cup and PCLM points, though he did compete in the inaugural World 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway and in the 1964 Daytona 500 and Richmond 250. After this foray, his Nextel Cup series starts were limited to an annual start in the Motor Trend 500, then held each January at Riverside International Raceway. He did compete regularly in the PCLM series, primarily driving for owners Floyd Johnson or Cos Cancilla, finishing in the top ten in points eight times between 1956 and 1969, with a best points finish of 3rd on three occasions (1963, 1967 and 1968). He had five career victories in the PCLM series, the last one coming at Tri-Cities Speedway in West Richland, Washington in July 1969. Cook scored one career win in the Nextel Cup series at the old California State Fairgrounds in Sacramento, California on September 11, 1960. The 100 mile race took place on the 1 mile dirt oval. Cook, driving Floyd Johnson's Dodge, edged Scotty Cain's T-Bird. Cook's racing career came to an end when he was severely injured in a crash during the 1970 Motor Trend 500 at Riverside International Raceway on January 18, 1970. His Ford crashed into the end of the turn 9 wall and he suffered head trauma and many broken bones. After his accident left him using a wheelchair full-time and with large medical and hospital bills, benefit races were held for him at Southern California tracks. Cook was murdered on November 29, 1983, by a drifter who broke into his Oceanside, California apartment and beat him to death with one of his racing trophies. In 2006, Jim Cook was inducted into the West Coast Stock Car Hall of Fame.

It is located directly above the Family Dining Room on the State Floor and looks out upon the North Lawn. The Dining Room is adjacent to the Family Kitchen, a small kitchen designed for use by the First Family, and served by a dumbwaiter connected to the main kitchen on the ground floor. The space was originally occupied by a bedroom suite known as the Prince of Wales Room. From 1929 to 1948, this suite was known as the Lincoln Bedroom. The bedroom suite was structurally changed in 1961 to create a dining room and kitchen in the First Family's residence. Early history of the room The Prince of Wales Room some time between 1897 and 1900, when it served as First Lady Ida McKinley's bedroom. The President's Dining Room is located in the northwest corner of the Second Floor. When this part of the Executive Residence was completed in 1809, a bedroom suite occupied the space. What is now the private stairs and Cosmetology Room were the eastern chamber and closet of the suite, A bedroom and toilet occupied what is now the President's Dining Room, and a lady's dressing room was in the space currently occupied by the Family Kitchen, the kitchen storage space, and the pantry. This space was little changed by 1825. Since the private stairs from the Ground Floor were now complete, the closet in the eastern chamber was removed and a landing for the stairs inserted in the middle of the room. This effectively created an open storage area in the southern third of the chamber. First Lady Louisa Adams and her niece, Mary Hellen, used the bedroom and dressing room as a bedroom suite (but did not occupy the eastern chamber). From March 1829 to the summer of 1830, all three rooms were occupied by Jack and Emily Donelson and their four children. President William Henry Harrison used the larger bedroom as his personal bedroom during his 32-day presidency in 1841. Robert Tyler (son of President John Tyler), his wife, and daughter used all three rooms from April 1841 to March 1845. From 1845 to 1849, the bedroom, dressing room, and eastern chamber were used by Augusta Tabb Walker and her two small children. The Prince of Wales Room The bedroom suite became known as the Prince of Wales Room after Albert Edward, Prince of Wales stayed in the room in 1860. Although a full bath was added to the eastern chamber, there was no connecting door between it and the bedroom. To accommodate the bathroom, the stairs were moved from the middle to the southern part of the room, and the storage space eliminated. Mary Todd Lincoln's refurbishment of the White House in 1861 led to historic changes in the room. Mrs. Lincoln purchased two armchairs, a rosewood center table, a chest of drawers, four side balloon-back side chairs, a sofa, and—most importantly—a wide, long rosewood bed frame for the room. The headboard was pierced and richly carved with images of birds, grapes, and vines. The footboard featured similar, though more simply-carved, images. Attached to the headboard was a gilt canopy carved in the shape of a crown, with a shield in the front. Purple satin trimmed in gold lace hung from the canopy. This bed became known as the \\"Lincoln bed\\", even though President Lincoln is not known to have slept in it. Mrs. Lincoln also purchased a Wilton carpet to cover the floor, and purple-tinted French velvet wallpaper with crimson stripes and repetitive golden images of a moss rose tree in bloom. In this configuration, the bedroom was used by Willie Lincoln, who died in it. On April 16, 1865, Dr. Janvier Woodward and Dr. Edward Curtis autopsied, and Dr. Charles D. Brown embalmed, Abraham Lincoln in this room. First Lady Eliza Johnson used the small eastern chamber as her bedroom, while the First Family used the larger bedroom (later to be the President's Dining Room) as a living room. The large room was later used as a bedroom by Nellie Grant (daughter of President Ulysses S. Grant); Fanny Hayes (daughter of President Rutherford B. Hayes); Mary \\"Mollie\\" Garfield (daughter of President James Garfield); Ellen \\"Nell\\" Arthur (daughter of President Chester Arthur); President Grover Cleveland and First Lady Frances Cleveland; James Robert and Mary Harrison McKee and their two small children; President William McKinley and his wife, Ida; Alice Roosevelt (daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt); Ethel Roosevelt (daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt); First Lady Helen Taft; Eleanor Wilson (daughter of President Woodrow Wilson); and Calvin Coolidge, Jr.; The room was used as a surgery in 1907 when newly-married Alice Roosevelt (now Alice Roosevelt Longworth) was stricken by appendicitis. Rather than go to a hospital, her appendectomy was performed in the Prince of Wales Room. Lincoln Bedroom Lincoln Bedroom in 1947. After the death of Calvin Coolidge, Jr. in July 1924, the bedroom suite was unoccupied for some years. In 1929, the Coolidges moved the \\"Lincoln Bed\\" into the bedroom suite and formally renamed it the Lincoln Bedroom. This large, four-poster bed had been purchased by Mary Todd Lincoln in 1861 and placed in the Prince of Wales Room. Although there is no evidence Abraham Lincoln ever slept in it, it subsequently became known as the Lincoln Bed. It had moved to several other rooms (and even placed in storage) in the intervening years, but now was restored to its original setting. The Lincoln Bedroom was used as a guest bedroom until the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, when it was occupied by Lorena Hickok (journalist and aide to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt). After Roosevelt's death in 1945, it became the bedroom of Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman. Major architectural changes were made to the Lincoln Bedroom when the White House was gutted and renovated in 1952. In the smaller eastern chamber, the bathroom was removed, the stairs were widened, and the stairs moved into the middle of the space (which allowed an enclosed storage space to be created south of the stairs). The passage from the eastern chamber to the bedroom was closed as well. The 1952 reconstruction turned the bedroom into a mirror image of the president's bedroom across the Center Hall. The bedroom's south wall was made convex, which created a walled-off dead space in the room's southeast corner. The southwest corner now became storage space accessible from the dressing room. After the reconstruction, Margaret Truman continued to use it as her bedroom. In 1953, First Lady Mamie Eisenhower turned it from a bedroom into a sitting room for her mother, Elivera \\"Minnie\\" Doud. From Lincoln Bedroom into dining room The President's Dining Room after its creation during the Kennedy administration. In 1961, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy transformed the Lincoln Bedroom into the President's Dining Room. Kennedy felt the Family Dining Room on the State Floor was too cavernous and impersonal in which to raise a young family, and decided that a smaller, more intimate dining room should be created on the Second Floor. A small kitchen took over the space which was once a dressing room, with a pantry and storage space occupying the southern half of the space. (The storage closet created in the now-convex room to the east was accessed from the new pantry.) The bedroom became the new Family Dining Room. At first, the walls of the President's Dining Room were merely painted off- white, and the room furnished with Louis XVI chairs and a table belonging to the Kennedys. During the presidential transition, Kennedy was advised on White House decor by her veteran interior decorator and good friend Dorothy \\"Sister\\" Kinnicutt Parish. Although Kennedy chose French interior designer Stéphane Boudin to decorate most of the executive mansion, his design for the President's Dining Room was rejected in favor of Sister Parish's recommendations. The look of the President's Dining Room was defined by its wallpaper. The wallpaper was a 1960 reproduction of paper printed by Zuber et Cie in France some time in the early to mid 1800s. It was discovered in a London antique shop by Kennedy friend and socialite Brooke Astor. Known as \\"Scenes of Revolutionary America\\", the wallpaper depicts various events in the American Revolutionary War. The wallpaper is based on an 1834 wallpaper printed by Zuber, \\"Scenic America\\", which depicted various American landscapes and which Kennedy had hung in the Diplomatic Reception Room. (\\"Scenic America\\", in turn was derived from engravings made by Engelmann in the 1820s.) To match the colors of the wallpaper, window draperies of blue and green silk damask were hung in the room. Their design was a copy of an early 1800s design found in a book. These were topped by window treatments of green silk with gold bullion fringe. A Hereke rug from Turkey, in a similar color style, covered the floor. A mantel made of plaster mixed with other materials, installed over the fireplace in the east wall in 1952, was retained. Designed about 1815 by Robert Welford in Philadelphia, the mantel is inscribed with Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's famous message, issued after the Battle of Lake Erie in 1813: \\"We have met the enemy, and they are ours\\". The room was lit with an Empire style chandelier, manufactured in the 1700s by Waterford Crystal and purchased in London by banker and art collector Chester Dale. It was given to the White House in 1948. The room was furnished with Federal style antiques. Twelve dining room chairs, crafted in the Sheraton style in Baltimore in 1785, were donated to the White House in 1961 by Mrs. Charles W. Engelhard, Jr. The chairs were initially reupholstered in an off-white damask approximating mother-of-pearl, designed by Parish and woven by Bergamo Fabrics. The fabric stained too easily, and in early 1963 Mrs. Kennedy asked Boudin to recommend a new upholster. Boudin selected white leather, tooled to look like silk damask and manufactured by Maison Jansen (the design firm for which Boudin worked). The chairs surrounded a Sheraton pedestal dining table. The Engelhards also donated a Federalist hunt board crafted in the American South. A side table, attributed to cabinetmaker John Shaw (cabinetmaker) of Annapolis, Maryland; a mahogany sideboard manufactured in New England and originally owned by Daniel Webster; a setee with caned seat; and a hunt table in the Hepplewhite style also adorned the room. Additional Federalist dining chairs were donated in 1962. Serving items in the President's Dining Room during the Kennedy administration included a silver dinner service purchased by President Andrew Jackson in 1833, a tureen purchased by President James Monroe, a French silver dessert service, two French-made wine coolers, and a vegetable serving dish purchased by President Jackson. Ford, Carter, and Reagan refurbishments The President's Dining Room in 1976, after the Zuber wallpaper was removed. First Lady Betty Ford had the dining room's Zuber wallpaper removed. Luckily, the wallpaper was installed with a linen backing, which allowed it to be detached from the wall and rolled up without incurring much damage. Ford then had the walls painted yellow. In 1977, First Lady Rosalynn Carter had the Zuber wallpaper reinstalled. In 1984, First Lady Nancy Reagan more extensively refurbished the President's Dining Room. Reproductions were made of the Sheraton chairs, which had suffered extensive wear and tear after nearly a quarter century of use. The reproductions were upholstered in blue horsehair (a historically accurate fabric for the Federal period), with a gold diamond and rosette pattern dyed into it. The Zuber wallpaper in the room was also treated, conserved, and stabilized. Clinton renovation The President's Dining Room after renovation during the Clinton administration. The room was again redecorated in 1997 by Kaki Hockersmith, the personal interior designer for President Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hockersmith felt the room was gloomy due to the color of the wallpaper and the lack of light, but the historic wallpaper could not be removed without incurring further damage. Instead, thin wooden lathes were nailed to the walls, and a new wall covering attached to them. This completely obscured the 1961 wallpaper without having to remove it. For the new wall covering, Hockersmith chose a pale green silk (manufactured by Scalamandré, Inc.) with a moiré pattern, onto which was printed medallions in two different tones of green. Portions of the frieze around the top of the room were painted with a pale yellow glaze to bring out its detail. A new carpet, in colors complementary to the green wall covering, was also ordered and installed. The carpet, designed by Hockersmith, featured a diagonal grid-like background pattern designed to be both visually stimulating as well as better able to obscure stains and damage. Clusters of flowers and acorns, in the Colonial Revival style, were woven into the field of the carpet, which was woven by Scott Group Custom Carpets in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The Sheraton chairs were restored to the room, and reupholstered in a bright yellow patterned brocade with a curving garland of flowers down and across the seat. The pedestal table was removed, and a custom 1902 dining room table, designed by architect Stanford White installed. The room was decorated with paintings by Childe Hassam, Edmund C. Tarbell, and Guy C. Wiggins. George W. Bush refurbishment The pale green silk wall covering was removed during the presidency of George W. Bush, replaced by a soft yellow silk damask selected by the Bushes' interior decorator, Ken Blasingame. References ;Notes ;Citations Bibliography     Further reading * Abbott, James A.

Biography Pigalle grew up in Montmartre, Paris. She was brought up in an artistic home. Before she was ten years old, she was selected by the school choir. As a teenager, she played guitar in an all-female band, hanging out with punk musicians in Paris and London. She appeared in magazines such as i-D, Magazine No. 2, Grabuge and Facade. In the early 1980s, she moved to London, performed in clubs, made some recordings with Adrian Sherwood and recorded for Channel 4 an opera called The Kiss, written by Michael Nyman and produced by David Cunningham. She then signed a contract with ZTT Records and released an album on ZTT/Island Records in 1985 called Everything Could Be So Perfect. In 1986, Pigalle revamped Café de Paris, a club in Piccadilly, London, with a new concept: Les Nuits Du Mercredi. She also played at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. She was photographed by Lord Snowdon, Mario Testino and Nick Knight; her music and image were used in Japanese TV commercials for Jean-Paul Gaultier and Karl Lagerfeld. Around that time she toured Japan and Europe. In 1989, she performed for TV arts programme The South Bank Show for the anniversary of the French Revolution. Other TV appearances included The Tube (in the UK), Ardisson's Bains de Minuit (in France), Japan and Mexico. Pigalle left ZTT Records at the end of the 1980s and produced and starred in a Japanese commercial for Isetan with her song \\"Tango Contre La Montre\\". She was voted fifth Best Performer of the Year by Los Angeles radio station KCRW Morning Becomes Eclectic. She played a show at Chateau Marmont, Los Angeles. From 2001, mostly in London, Pigalle produced home movies and videos, electronic tracks, Polaroid self-portraits, paintings, poems, curated events in nightclubs, wrote an autobiographical screenplay, appeared in films, developed her art performances and the Amerotic Salons. The Amerotic Salon has been performed at The Colony Room and at Glastonbury Festival. From 2005 to 2007, she exhibited her paintings and self-portrait Polaroids (for which she created visual sets, erotic masks and crowns of flowers) at the Charing Cross Gallery, Michael Hoppen gallery, and the Aquarium Gallery. She called her art 'amerotic' ('âme' means 'soul' in French). In 2007, she launched a night at the Grill Room, Café Royal, called Spirit of Ecstasy, where she performed a futuristic cabaret show along with bohemian poets. In 2009 and 2010, she sang at shows in Mexico and at the Tuareg Festival au Désert in Timbuktu, Mali, Africa. In 2010 and 2011, Pigalle released the trilogy, L'âmerotica Part I and II on iTunes—21 surreal and erotic vignettes of poetry put to music. In 2013 she released a collection of new songs and erotic poems called Madame Sex. In 2015, she released Madame Sex and L'ame Erotique as an art CD, and played live concerts in London. In spring 2015, Pigalle created La nuit Amerotique, a new venture night in Soho, with a new philosophy, performing various material relating to Pigalle, Soho, Art and Eroticism, in various locations. She included her poetry from Madame Sex and invited performance artists who have lived and worked in Soho to illustrate and share the show. In 2016 she performed a show at the National Portrait Gallery, London. In summer 2016, she played an art show, Not Dead at the G511ERY Gallery, dedicated to her mother, followed by a Chinatown pop-up experimental show, The Last Chanteuse is Not Dead. In autumn-winter 2016/2017, Pigalle created the Madame Sex art performances in Pigalle, France, and followed up in the bars of Soho. In spring 2017, Les P'tites Femmes De Soho, her art show in Soho's We Are Cuts institution, was dedicated to nightlife's little women. In autumn 2017 she organised a multi media evening in Soho, Soho Mon Amour, at the 01 zero studios. She again performed at the National Portrait Gallery in London during its Cézanne exhibition. She celebrated the 40th anniversary of punk with an art show and a concert of punk songs in Hackney Wick called Never Mind Jackson Bollocks, Here's Anne Pigalle... 2018: Performance of \\"Memo from Turner\\" for the 50th anniversary of the film Performance in Powis Square.

She belongs to the Ngāi Te Rangi and Ngāti Ranginui iwis. Wereta has served as the Mäori representative on several government commissions or committees on the electoral system, education and justice. Career Wereta gained a BA Hons degree, then joined the Department of Statistics in the early 1970s. In 1992, Wereta became manager, Maori Statistics. She has also worked as a policy researcher and/or a manager in the Ministry of Maori Development and its predecessors, and in the Department of Internal Affairs. Wereta was employed as a social researcher at the Department of Maori Affairs in Wellington in 1988. Wereta served on the New Zealand National Commission for UNESCO. She was one of the three members of the Local Government Commission from 1 April 1990 until 31 March 1993, along with Sir Brian Elwood and Doug Pearson. Rejoining Statistics New Zealand in 2001, she was appointed General Manager, Maori Statistics. Public policy advisor Wereta was a member of the five-person 1985-86 New Zealand Royal Commission on the Electoral System that recommended mixed member proportional representation (MMP) for elections to the New Zealand Parliament, a major change from the previous first-past-the-post system. She was the only member of the commission with a known political affiliation (to the Labour Party), and also the only Maori and the only woman on the commission. The committee embraced the principles of fairness to women and to the Maori in their report, which was accepted. New Zealand now follows an MMP system of elections. In 1988, Wereta was appointed to serve on the Picot task force to review the functions of the Department of Education. Her role on the task force was to emphasise a Maori perspective. As the only Maori on the task force, she was at first marginalized. It was only when she threatened to resign that it was agreed to include a section on Maori aspirations in the report. The Picot Task Force caused fundamental changes in the New Zealand educational system towards greater school autonomy and separation of regulatory responsibilities into different agencies. In 1994, Wereta was appointed to the four-person Mäori Committee to the New Zealand Law Commission, an independent advisory body set up to review, reform and develop the law of New Zealand. The purpose of the committee is to assist the Law Commission in the \\"development of a bicultural framework for the law of New Zealand\\". She was a member of that committee when, on 15 September 1995, it submitted a report that rejected in the strongest terms the government proposal to abolish the right of appeal to the Privy Council. She was a contributor to the April 1999 report by the Law Commission on Justice: The Experiences of Mäori Women. In 2006, Wereta was appointed the government's representative on the Representation Commission to determine the boundaries of the Maori electoral districts. Other members were John McEnteer, representing the opposition, and Judge Bernard Kendall, chairperson. Dr Pita Sharples, co- leader of the Māori Party, criticized the appointment on the grounds that the government had not consulted his party. Papers As an authority on statistics, and Maori statistics in particular, Wereta has published and presented a number of academic papers. In 2002, she presented a paper on Statistics in the Wake of Challenges Posed by Cultural Diversity in a Globalization Context at the International Symposium on Cultural Statistics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. In July 2005 she was a keynote speaker at a conference of the Population Association of New Zealand. At a March 2006 meeting in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada of the UN Permanent Forum of Indigenous Peoples she presented a paper on Towards a Maori Statistics Framework.

It has been listed as Least Concern by IUCN as it remains common and displays some adaptability to ongoing habitat loss.  Description  The common treeshrew is one of the largest among treeshrews. Average body length is between , and average weight is around 190 g, with varying colours of reddish-brown, greyish or black upper parts and whitish belly. Its long, bushy tail is dark greyish- brown and almost reaches the length of the body. The paws are bare with sharp nails, and with a naked patch of skin above its long nose. Both sexes are similar. The animal has a head and body length of 13–21 cm and a tail length of 12–20 cm. The common treeshrew usually has a white, pale stripe on each shoulder. The two subspecies are T. g. longipes and T. g. salatana, with T. g. longipes being duller in color than T. g. salatana. The underparts of T. g. longipes are dull buff to reddish-buff, and the underside of the tail is greyish. The underparts and underside of the tail are dark reddish in T. g. salatana. Similar species are Tupaia splendidula and Tupaia montana.  Distribution and habitat  Common treeshrews occur south of about 10°N latitude in southern Thailand through mainland Malaysia and adjacent coastal islands to Singapore. They inhabit protected areas, including the Pasoh Forest Reserve on the Malay Peninsula and Krau Wildlife Reserve. In Indonesia, they are found on the islands of Siberut, Batu, Sumatra, Java, Bangka, Riau, Lingga and Anambas. Usually they are found in primary dipterocarp forest, but are tolerant to some degree of habitat modification. They have also been recorded from secondary forest, plantations, fruit orchards, and trees near housing areas.Parr, J. W. K. (2003). Large Mammals of Thailand. Sarakadee Press, Bangkok, Thailand. Common treeshrews are probably present throughout the lowlands and hills up to in the Kelabit Highlands of Borneo. The subspecies T. g. longipes occurs in the north of Borneo, in Sarawak, and in East Kalimantan, including Sabah. The subspecies T. g. salatana occurs in the south of Rajang River and Kayan River in Borneo.Payne J., Francis, C.M., Phillips, K. (1985) A Field Guide to the Mammals of Borneo, Malaysia. The Sabah Society. pp. 161–162.  Ecology and behavior  Common treeshrews are active during the day, and forage for food alone or in pairs, mainly on the ground, among shrubs and tree holes. They feed on fruits, seeds, leaves, and insects, especially ants and spiders.Nowak, R. (1999). Walker’s Mammals of the World (6th Ed.) Vol 1. Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press. pp.245-246. They are also reported to catch lizards. They are very agile in climbing both large vertical tree trunks and bushes, and occasionally jump from stems of a young tree to that of another as much as away. Their climbing is concentrated in lower heights. They frequently scent-mark their territories by chest and anogenital rubbing with a secretion from glands on chest and scrotum. Adult males are more secretory than females and juveniles. In the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, mean home ranges of adult males were estimated at , of adult females at , of juvenile males at , and of juvenile females at , with partial overlaps between male and female ranges varying from 0.4% to 56.8%. Home ranges of adult residents of the same sex overlap to a lesser degree than those of opposite sexes. A male's range may include the ranges of two or three females. A high overlap between ranges of one adult male and one adult female indicates they form a stable pair. Juvenile ranges of either sex adjoin or overlap with ranges of adults, suggesting the juveniles are family members. Individuals of the same sex are involved in aggressive territorial chases.Kawamichi, T., Kawamichi, M. (1979) Spatial organization and territory of tree shrews (Tupaia glis) Animal Behaviour 27: 381–393 Juvenile males depart from their family's territory sooner than juvenile females.  Reproduction  Both sexes of common treeshrews are sexually mature at the age of about three months. In captivity, females give birth for the first time at the age of about 4.5 mo, usually in February. A postpartum oestrus results in more births in April. Their oestrus cycle is eight to 39 days, and the gestation period lasts 40 to 52 days, after which a litter of one to three individuals is born. The newborn offspring weigh about 10 to 12 grams. Females suckle their young every other day, and neglect their young as long as possible. They would not even be able to identify their own young if they did not mark them with the scent produced from glands in their sternum and abdomen. Juveniles leave the nest between 25 and 35 days of age. Longevity of a captive common treeshrew has been recorded as 12 yr and 5 mo. From October to December, common treeshrews are reproductively inactive. The mating season starts at the onset of the monsoon season in December and lasts until February. Oestrus and preoestrus behavior is characterized by adult males pursuing adult females. Males emit chattering, and appear to be extremely excited. They also chase each other and fight. Females do not actively choose a partner among the male participants of chases. The dominant male gains access to females.Kawamichi, T., Kawamichi, M. (1982) Social System and Independence of Offspring in Tree shrews Primates (23) 2: 189–205 In tropical rainforest habitats in West Malaysia, population density varies from two to five animals per hectare. Their annual breeding coincides with the abundance of invertebrates after the dry season. Their main reproductive period is between February and June, and their litter size is invariably two. Some females breed more than once a season, and the age at first pregnancy is seven months. The main period of emigration or mortality of young is during the breeding period or monsoon.Langham, NPE (1982) Ecology of the Common Tree Shrew, Tupaia glis in Peninsular Malaysia. Journal of Zoology. Vol. 197 (3): 323–344 Abstract  Taxonomic status  The species was first described in February 1820 by the French explorers Pierre-Médard Diard and Alfred Duvaucel in their jointly written article \\"Sur une nouvelle espèce de Sorex — Sorex Glis\\", which is preceded by an illustration. They observed specimens in Penang and Singapore, and considered them a species of Sorex, and not as a new genus.Diard, P.M., Duvaucel, A. (1820) \\"Sur une nouvelle espèce de Sorex — Sorex Glis\\". Asiatick researches, or, Transactions of the society instituted in Bengal, for inquiring into the history and antiquities, the arts, sciences, and literature of Asia, Volume 14. Bengal Military Orphans Press, 1822 Between 1821 and 1940, several zoologists described the species from other areas. The species still retains many forms of uncertain rank and validity, and is pending a detailed study. Some forms were formerly considered synonyms of Tupaia glis; some were elevated to species level. Synonyms include:  Threats  Common treeshrews are threatened due to deforestation and ensuing human activities in agriculture (for example, using trenchers to dig ditches), plantations, and commercial logging. Moreover, other pressures, such as hunting for food and sport, can create pressure to the species.  As a model organism  Tupaia glis is used by researchers as animal models for human diseases because of their close relationship to primates, and their well-developed senses of vision and hearing. Research studies have included hepatitis.Rui Qi Yan, Jian Jia Su, Ding Rui Huang, You Chuan Gan, Chun Yang and Gua Hau Huang (1996). Human hepatitis B virus and hepatocellular carcinoma I. Experimental infection of tree shrews with hepatitis B virus. Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology, Volume 122, Number 5: 283–288.

The style was more fanciful than historically accurate, though the first archaeological surveys of Greece had begun to appear at this time.James Stuart and Nicholas Revett's James Stuart (1713–1788)#Antiquities of AthensThe Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece (London, 1762) led the way. It was characterized by severe rectilinear and trabeated forms with a somewhat crude Greek detailing incorporating bold pilasters, Ionic scrolls, Greek key and scroll frets and guilloche. The style's origin may be found in the suite of furniture designed by Louis-Joseph Le Lorrain for the Parisian financier Ange- Laurent de La Live de Jully (now in the Musée Condé, Chantilly). In comparison to the prevailing Rococo style, the austerity of these pieces is stark, and found praise from the contemporary authority on Greek antiquity, the Comte de Caylus. Also influential were the engravings of the architect Jean-François de Neufforge, the architecture of Charles De Wailly, and the designs of Philippe de La Guêpière. The goût grec was a style of avant-garde circles in upper- class Paris, but was ignored at the court at Versailles, where a more conservative, stiffened Louis XV style and modified \\"Transitional\\" style obtained. The goût grec was short-lived and replaced quickly with the delicate, linear (or insipid, according to preference) goût étrusque and goût arabesque, neo-Etruscan and \\"arabesque\\" fashions with closer parallels in contemporary British Adam style of the 1770s and 80s.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve SK L/45 guns and had a top speed of . Strassburg spent the first year of her service overseas, after which she was assigned to the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet. She saw significant action at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914 and participated in the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in December 1914. By 1916, the ship was transferred to the Baltic to operate against the Russian Navy. She saw action during Operation Albion in the Gulf of Riga in October 1917, including screening for the battleships and during the Battle of Moon Sound. She returned to the North Sea for the planned final operation against the British Grand Fleet in the last weeks of the war, and was involved in the mutinies that forced the cancellation of the operation. The ship served briefly in the new Reichsmarine in 1919 before being transferred to Italy as a war prize. She was formally transferred in July 1920 and renamed Taranto for service in the Italian Navy. In 1936–1937, she was rebuilt for colonial duties and additional anti-aircraft guns were installed. She saw no significant action during World War II until the Armistice that ended Italy's participation in the war. She was scuttled by the Italian Navy, captured and raised by the Germans, and sunk by Allied bombers in October 1943. The Germans raised the ship again, which was sunk a second time by bombers in September 1944. Taranto was finally broken up for scrap in 1946–1947. Design Strassburg was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced normally and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of AEG-Vulcan steam turbines driving two propellers. They were designed to give , but reached in service. These were powered by sixteen coal- fired Marine-type water-tube boilers, although they were later altered to use fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. These gave the ship a top speed of . Strassburg carried of coal, and an additional of oil that gave her a range of approximately at . Strassburg had a crew of 18 officers and 336 enlisted men. The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve SK L/45 guns in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle, eight were located amidships, four on either side, and two were side by side aft. The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees, which allowed them to engage targets out to . They were supplied with 1,800 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. She was also equipped with a pair of torpedo tubes with five torpedoes; the tubes were submerged in the hull on the broadside. She could also carry 120 mines. The ship was protected by a waterline armored belt that was thick amidships. The conning tower had thick sides, and the deck was covered with up to 60 mm thick armor plate. Service history Strassburg was ordered under the contract name Ersatz and was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Wilhelmshaven in 1910 and launched on 24 August 1911, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 9 October 1912. Strassburg spent the first year of service overseas, from 1913 to 1914. She was selected to participate in a long-distance cruise to test the reliability of the new turbine propulsion system in the battleships and . The three ships were organized in a special \\"Detached Division\\". The trio departed Germany on 9 December 1913 and proceeded to the German colonies in western Africa. The ships visited Lomé in Togoland, Duala and Victoria in Kamerun, and Swakopmund in German South-West Africa. From Africa, the ships sailed to St. Helena and then on to Rio de Janeiro, arriving on 15 February 1914. Strassburg was detached to visit Buenos Aires, Argentina before returning to meet the two battleships in Montevideo, Uruguay. The three ships sailed south around Cape Horn and then north to Valparaiso, Chile, arriving on 2 April and remaining for over a week. On 11 April, the ships departed Valparaiso for the long journey back to Germany. On the return trip, the ships visited several more ports, including Bahía Blanca, Argentina, before returning to Rio de Janeiro. On 16 May the ships left Rio de Janeiro for the Atlantic leg of the journey; they stopped in Cape Verde, Madeira, and Vigo, Spain while en route to Germany. Strassburg, Kaiser, and König Albert arrived in Kiel on 17 June 1914. In the course of the voyage, the ships traveled some . A week later, on 24 June, the Detached Division was dissolved. After returning to Germany, Strassburg spent majority of her career in the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet. World War I On 16 August, some two weeks after the outbreak of World War I, Strassburg and conducted a sweep into the Hoofden to search for British reconnaissance forces. The two cruisers encountered a group of sixteen British destroyers and a light cruiser at a distance of about . Significantly outnumbered, the two German cruisers broke contact and returned to port. Strassburg was heavily engaged at the Battle of Heligoland Bight less than two weeks later, on 28 August. British battlecruisers and light cruisers raided the German reconnaissance screen commanded by Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass in the Heligoland Bight. Strassburg was the first German cruiser to leave port to reinforce the German reconnaissance forces. At 11:00, she encountered the badly damaged British cruiser , which had been hit several times by and . Strassburg attacked Arethusa, but was driven off by the 1st Destroyer Flotilla. She lost contact with the British in the mist, but located them again after 13:10 from the sound of British gunfire that destroyed the cruiser .Along with , she badly damaged three British destroyers—, , and —before being driven off again. Shortly thereafter, the British battlecruisers intervened and sank and Maass's flagship Cöln. Strassburg and the rest of the surviving light cruisers retreated into the haze and were reinforced by the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group. Strassburg was present during the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 15–16 December, as part of the screening force for the battlecruisers of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group. After completing the bombardment of the towns, the Germans began to withdraw, though British forces moved to intercept them. Strassburg, two of the other screening cruisers, and two flotillas of torpedo boats steamed between two British squadrons. In the heavy mist, which reduced visibility to less than , only her sister ship Stralsund was spotted, though only briefly. The Germans were able to use the bad weather to cover their withdrawal. The ship had been transferred to the Baltic by 1916, and so missed the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916. By 1917, she was assigned to the VI Scouting Group, which saw action during Operation Albion against the Russian naval forces in the Gulf of Riga. At 06:00 on 14 October 1917, Strassburg, , and left Libau to escort minesweeping operations in the Gulf of Riga. They were attacked by Russian coastal guns on their approach and were temporarily forced to turn away. By 08:45, however, they had anchored off the Mikailovsk Bank and the minesweepers began to clear a path in the minefields. Two days later, Strassburg and Kolberg joined the dreadnoughts and for a sweep of the Gulf of Riga. In the ensuing Battle of Moon Sound, the battleships destroyed the old pre-dreadnought and forced the pre-dreadnought to leave the Gulf. On 21 October, Strassburg and the battleship were tasked with assaulting the island of Kyno. The two ships bombarded the island; Strassburg expended approximately 55 rounds on the port of Salismünde. On 31 October, Strassburg carried the first military governor of the captured islands from Libau to Arensburg. By October 1918, Strassburg was assigned to the IV Scouting Group, which was to participate in a final, climactic attack by the High Seas Fleet. Admirals Reinhard Scheer and Hipper intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to secure a better bargaining position for Germany, whatever the cost to the fleet. On the morning of 27 October, days before the operation was scheduled to begin, around 45 crew members from Strassburgs engine room slipped over the side of the ship and went into Wilhelmshaven. The crewmen had to be rounded up and returned to the ship, after which the IV Scouting Group moved to Cuxhaven. Here, men from all six cruisers in the unit refused to work in protest of the war, and in support of the armistice proposed by Prince Maximilian. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on and then on several other battleships mutinied. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. In early November, Strassburg and steamed to Sassnitz. There, the commander of Strassburg took command of the naval forces in the port and invited a sailor's council to be formed to assist in controlling the forces there. Italian service After the war, Strassburg served briefly with the reorganized Reichsmarine in 1919. She was stricken from the naval register on 10 March 1920 and ceded to Italy as a war prize. She was transferred under the name \\"O\\" on 20 July 1920 in the French port of Cherbourg. Strassburg was commissioned into the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) on 2 June 1925 and her name was changed to Taranto, initially classed as a scout. Her two 8.8 cm anti-aircraft guns were replaced with two Italian 3-inch /40 anti-aircraft guns. She also had her superfiring 15 cm gun moved amidships, but in 1926 it was moved back to clear room for a platform to hold a scout plane. She initially carried a Macchi M.7, which was later replaced by a CANT 25AR. From May 1926, Taranto was deployed to the Red Sea to patrol Italian East Africa, where she served as the flagship of the colonial flotilla there. She remained there until January 1927. Taranto was reclassified as a cruiser on 19 July 1929, and that year she joined the other two ex-German cruisers, and and the ex-German destroyer as the Scout Division of the 1st Squadron, based in La Spezia. In 1931, her M.7 seaplane was replaced with the CANT 24AR seaplane. Another tour in East Africa followed from September 1935 to 1936. After returning to Italy, she underwent a refit that involved removing her forward two boilers and the funnel that vented them. This reduced her power to and top speed to , though by World War II only could be maintained. Eight /65 and ten machine guns were added for close-range anti-aircraft defense. In early July 1940, Taranto, two minelayers, and a pair of destroyers laid a series of minefields in the Gulf of Taranto and in the southern Adriatic, totaling 2,335 mines. She was thereafter assigned to the Forza Navale Speciale (Special Naval Force) along with the other ex-German cruiser still in Italian service, Bari. The FNS was slated to take part in an amphibious invasion of the British island of Malta in 1942, but the operation was cancelled. The ship was transferred to Livorno on 26 February and reduced to a training ship. She was decommissioned in December in La Spezia and was scuttled there on 9 September 1943 a day after the armistice that ended the war for Italy was declared to prevent her from being seized by the Germans, who rapidly moved to occupy the country after Italy surrendered. The Germans captured the ship and re-floated her, though she was sunk by Allied bombers on 23 October. The Germans re- floated the ship again, and again she was sunk by bombers, on 23 September 1944 in the outer La Spezia roadstead, where the Germans had moved the hulk to block one of the entrances to the Gulf of La Spezia. Taranto was ultimately raised and broken up for scrap in 1946–1947.

Acer (November 11, 1949 – September 3, 1990) was an American dentist who was accused of infecting six of his patients with HIV. One of his alleged victims was Kimberly Bergalis. Biography=Early life David Johnson Acer was born November 11, 1949 in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in North Canton, a suburb of Canton. He was the first of four children of Victor and Harriet Acer. He graduated from Hoover High School in 1967, where he participated in wrestling, the German Club, and the school's yearbook staff. After graduation, Acer enrolled at Ohio State University, then enrolled in the university's dental school in 1970. Students and professors regarded Acer as a shy but solid individual who rarely missed a class and seldom partook in party antics on campus. He graduated from dental school in March 1974, maintaining a B average. Acer then joined the U.S. Air Force, where he held the rank of captain and practiced dentistry while stationed in Germany. Meanwhile, his family had relocated to Beaver, Pennsylvania. Acer did not follow them there after his discharge and instead moved to Venice, Florida, where he remained for year before moving to Miami. Career Once arriving in Florida, Acer joined a dental group practice as an associate, where he quickly became a success in his field. That success led him to opening his own practice in Jensen Beach in the early 1980s. This too was a success, largely due to a high number of referrals he received from CIGNA Dental Health of Florida. The carrier covered hundreds of state employees and Martin County schoolteachers. Acer settled in Stuart, which was a twenty-minute commute to his practice. He maintained a brick and stucco ranch home on Alamanda Way, where he kept a pet cocker spaniel and a 20-foot fishing boat. He was described by friends and colleagues as professional, but not very social in large group settings. When not at the office, Acer enjoyed fishing, tennis, and golf. He was often seen playing tennis at Falkenburg Tennis Club, two days a week. In 1985, Acer added an associate dentist, Elizabeth Greenhill. Greenhill told the Palm Beach Post that she had wanted him to autoclave his dental instruments, though he did routinely steam clean them. She told the paper that Acer did not make any extra effort towards the enforcement of universal precautions, despite CIGNA'S procedural manual for dentists covered this very subject, which included the use of masks and gloves while treating patients. Acer used neither, but this was overlooked by CIGNA's dental director, who regularly visited Acer's practice. AIDS Diagnosis Acer believed he had contracted HIV in 1986 through a sexual contact, but did not exhibit any symptoms of AIDS. Meanwhile, his practice continued to grow, with him seeing close to 2,000 patients in 1987, clearing about $50,000 that year. That was also the year that Acer began to show visible symptoms of AIDS. Acer saw Frank Gutierrez, his general practitioner, in September 1987 for treatment of a sore throat. Gutierrez, who knew of Acer's lifestyle habits, warned him to practice safe sex. Acer then saw an oral surgeon who took a biopsy of the roof of his mouth. Rolf Wolfrom diagnosed Acer as having Kaposi's sarcoma, a form of AIDS-related cancer. Acer then confessed that he had likely had 150 different sexual partners in the past decade, and had not used a condom during his last sexual experience two months prior. He began taking AZT and getting treatment at the VA Medical Center for the oral lesions. When he returned to Gutierrez in November, Acer informed him that he was practicing safe sex only. In December 1987, Acer treated Kimberly Bergalis for two abscessed molars and continued to see other patients, well into 1988. With symptoms advancing, Acer's work began to get sloppy, prompting other patients to take notice that he was reusing gloves and other disposable components, not sterilizing instruments, and taking shortcuts that put patient safety in jeopardy. Acer also began showing lesions on his skin, prompting him to wear long sleeves and buttoned collars, regardless of the weather. By early 1989, Acer's symptoms worsened, with frequent coughing, blurred vision and more lesions appearing on his skin. By summer, he had missed so much work that he could no longer keep it a secret and told his family of his illness after being hospitalized with pneumonia. Those who inquired about his health were told he had terminal cancer. He then put his practice up for sale, later selling it to Ben Emerson, who kept 20 of Acer's patients and the reception room furniture. Almost everything else was thrown out. In March 1990, Kim Bergalis was diagnosed with AIDS. Officials from the CDC office in Atlanta investigated Acer after learning of Bergalis' medical history. Acer by this time, was housebound and receiving care from his parents, who had relocated from Pennsylvania to Florida. He told the CDC that since learning he had AIDS, he wore gloves and masks when treating patients. The CDC concluded on July 27, 1990 that based on epidemiologic and laboratory findings, it was possible that Acer transmitted the HIV virus from himself to Bergalis. Three days before his death, Acer ran an open letter in several newspapers that he had AIDS. Death Acer was taken from his home on August 31, 1990, to live his final days at Hospice of Palm Beach County at West Palm Beach. Acer was suffering from hallucinations, a severe cough, and lesions in his mouth, and on his skin and lungs. His weight had dropped to 115 pounds from 175. On September 3, 1990, Acer died of complications arising from Kaposi's sarcoma. He was later cremated at Tri-County Crematory in Stuart. There was no memorial service. Aftermath Four days after Acer had died, Kimberly Bergalis' family sued his estate for malpractice, and Kimberly had decided to go public with her story.

Conservation and threats Satellite picture of Bahia interior forests ecoregion (black line). In this image, it's possible to observe the deforestation degree of the ecoregion. Bahia interior forest is one of the most modified ecoregions in Atlantic forest region. Most forests remnants has less than 10 km², and even these are currently under strong pressure from anthropogenic activities, as fires, illegal deforestation and predatory hunting. Less than 2 percent of Bahia interior forests are protected as conservation units. The largest forest remnant of this ecoregion is the Rio Doce State Park, with 359 km² of area.

Previous bands include Nothingface in which he was a founding member. After Nothingface he was involved in a band with Skrape vocalist Billy Keeton. In the 1980s he was in thrash metal band Have Mercy. His style of playing and writing relies more on grooves and hooks rather than shredding and fast soloing. Early life Maxwell was born on June 25, 1968 in Baltimore, Maryland. He got his first guitar, a 1969 Gibson Les Paul, when he was eight years old. According to Maxwell, he still owns it. Career=Nothingface The band started when drummer Chris Houck put an ad out in a local magazine called Rox Magazine in Baltimore. Tom Maxwell, who was living in Baltimore at the time, contacted Chris about the ad, and said he was interested in getting together and jamming. Tom sent a tape with music that he had been working on. Chris, who was living with Bill Gaal at the time in Damascus, Maryland, got the tape and they were both impressed with what Tom had sent. From there they got together and jammed on covers of Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Jane's Addiction and clicked. Hellyeah Maxwell became friends with Mudvayne's lead vocalist Chad Gray, and they talked about the possibility of forming a supergroup. The following year, Nothingface toured with Mudvayne and talks to form the supergroup continued, although were constantly put on hold due to scheduling conflicts. At this time, Gray and Maxwell had brainstormed five band names. Mudvayne guitarist Greg Tribbett approached Maxwell \\"out of the blue\\" and wanted to join the band. Nothingface drummer Tommy Sickles originally helmed the drum kit for the band's demo, however, things did not work out and the search for a new drummer began.Jon Wiederhorn, \\"Hellyeah: Night Riders\\", Revolver, March 2007, p. 60-64 (link to Revolver back issues ) The band knew former Pantera and Damageplan drummer Vinnie Paul, and tried to persuade him to join the band as their drummer. Originally, Paul was not sure if he would return to music after the death of his brother, Dimebag Darrell and an 18-month hiatus: \\"It was one of those things that I didn't think I'd be a part of this ever again without him, and after about a year and a half had gone by, these guys called me up, Chad [Gray] and Tom [Maxwell], they were like, 'We're thinking about putting this band together, would you be into it?' First couple of times, I told them, 'No, I don't think I'm ready to do this yet.' And they just were real persistent, they kept calling me. And one night, I had been drinking some red wine and listening to some KISS on 12\\" vinyl record and I said, 'You know what, lets take a shot at this, lets see what happens.'\\" The band's persistence paid off and Paul joined the project. Paul commented about joining the project: \\"Everybody had their head in the right place and that let's-tear-the-world-a-new-ass attitude\\". Personal life When not touring, he resides in Maryland with his wife and son.

He was the author of numerous dictionaries, grammars, poems and short stories. He also founded Gwalarn, a literary journal in Breton where many young authors published their first writings during the 1920s and 1930s. Life and works Hemon served in the French Army at the beginning of the Second World War, where he was wounded and taken prisoner by the Germans. Back in Brest in August 1940, he took back publishing Gwalarn. In November 1940, he was appointed as director of programmes at Radio Roazhon-Breizh, a Breton language weekly broadcast set up by the Propagandastaffel.Breton literature during German Occupation , Mercator, The University of Wales From 1941, he directed the weekly publication Arvor. In October 1942, Hemon was appointed by Leo Weisgerber to help found the \\"Celtic Institute of Brittany\\". Hemon rendered other services to the Germans, like helping in compiling files against préfet Ripert. At the Liberation, Hemon fled to Germany, where he was imprisoned. After one year of jail he was sentenced by the French state to ten years of \\"dégradation nationale\\" for the offence of \\"Indignité nationale\\". He decided therefore to go in exile to Ireland. He worked there for the Institute for Advanced Studies. He would never go back to Brittany. Despite all this he never stopped working for the Breton language, and wrote for instance A Historical Morphology and Syntax of Breton in 1975. He created the magazine Ar Bed Keltiek that resembled Kannadig Gwalarn or Arvor. He died in 1978. He was buried in Brest.  Attack on his reputation  Hemon's reputation as a scholar led to the naming of institutions in Brittany after him. In 2000 controversy erupted over this, as Hemon's role in the war was publicised. Some of his statements made at the time were disinterred, particularly anti-French opinions expressed in Ni hon unan. As a result, the school Diwan in Le Relecq- Kerhuon, and the Cultural centre of Guingamp, which had been named after Hemon, had to change names.

Monadh Liath is Scottish Gaelic, and means \\"grey mountain range\\". Running in a northeast to southwest direction, it lies on the western side of Strathspey, to the west of the Cairngorms and to the south east of Loch Ness. Its southwestern limit is usually taken to be Corrieyairack Pass (763m) but similar uplands continue to Glen Roy and Spean Bridge. The range is within the Highland council area, and the south and east fringes are within the Cairngorms National Park. The high point of the range is Càrn Dearg, at , located south of Inverness. This is one of four Munros in the Monadhliath, the others being A'Chailleach (), Geal Chàrn (), and Càrn Sgulain (). The Monadhliath Mountains are designated a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The Monadh Liath differs greatly in character from the greater Highland mountains to the south and west, as an elevated moorland with no proper ridges. The four Munros are all on the Spey rim, three making a classic circuit from Newtonmore; the interior is rarely visited. The main valley within the Monadh Liath is the Findhorn. It is unusually sinuous, being an incised meandering river valley very little altered by glaciers. The landscape of the Monadh Liath is one of the most ancient in Britain, its essentials as a secondary massif flanking the Cairngorms having evolved continuously since the Caledonian Mountains were created over 400 million years ago. Thus the land surface still slopes gently northwest towards the Great Glen, away from the main Grampian divide which crosses the Cairngorms.David Jarman 'Landscape evolution of the Monadhliath' (2013). In Boston CM, Lukas S and Merritt JW (eds) The Quaternary of the Monadhliath and the Great Glen - Field Guide. Quaternary Research Association, London, 9-24. Although icesheets have repeatedly covered the Monadh Liath, they have done little to change its character: there are no corries away from the Munros fringe, and only a few short glaciated troughs, notably Glen Killin on the north. It has just become recognised that thin ice on the plateau is frozen to the ground, but as it starts to flow into the troughs it thickens, accelerates, and warms up so it can erode and enlarge them. This has occurred as recently as the very last (Younger Dryas) glacial period ~12000 years ago.Clare Boston, Sven Lukas, Simon Carr 2015. A Younger Dryas plateau icefield in the Monadhliath, Scotland, and implications for regional palaeoclimate. Quaternary Science Reviews 108, 139-162 Until the last few years, the Monadh Liath interior was remote and desolate, a naturally treeless and largely trackless wilderness, one of the last large tracts of 'wild land' in human terms at least, known only to a few deer and grouse enthusiasts. The renewable energy gold rush has already led to the Glendoe hydro-electric scheme above Fort Augustus. The actual reservoir and dam are not unduly intrusive, but the extensive network of heavy-duty access roads to service all the weirs diverting water into the catchment have altered its remoteness and wildness. These roads have also facilitated a very large wind energy project, one of several encouraged by proximity to the high-capacity Beauly-Denny power transmission line over Corrieyairack Pass, and which now dominate the NW Grampian skyline in views from the Cairngorms and Western Highlands up to 50 miles away.

A significant programme of urban development has established Sunniside as a centre of culture, film, dining, entertainment and art in the city. It is also known as the historic heart of Sunderland's legal and real estate sectors, with many solicitors and estate agencies based in the area. History Sunniside grew up in the Victorian Era as the original business centre of Sunderland. At the height of Sunderland's power as a shipbuilding centre, most of the mercantile insurance and reinsurance companies and other associated business functions were based in Sunniside, as were a substantial number of foreign consulates, including the Netherlands, Denmark and Russia. Situated between West Sunniside and Norfolk Street is the old General Post Office building, now converted to residential use. As the economic fortunes of Sunderland waned in the 1980s, however, many of the lucrative businesses left Sunniside and many others moved westward to new locations in the city centre and out of town, leaving the area to become plagued by urban decay. In the late 1990s, the Sunniside district was earmarked by the local council as a priority for urban renewal. Regeneration In 2003, Sunderland's area regeneration company, Sunderland Arc released 15 year long proposals for Urban regeneration in the area, and they worked with the One Northeast regional redevelopment corporation and the city council to begin improvements on Sunniside with an investment.

Records of donations from Vögler to the Nazi Party from as early as 1931 exist. Vögler met Adolf Hitler on 11 September 1931. From 1932 Vögler openly funded the Nazi party. He was a member of the Freundeskreis Himmler. Hitler became German Chancellor on 30 January 1933. He held a meeting with Hermann Göring, and German industrialists on 20 February 1933. Vögler was present at this meeting. Hitler presented the Nazi Party's political plans, and received a total of three million marks in donations. During the latter part of the 1930s, Vögler was described by Jewish businessman Max von der Porten as one of the industrialists who focused primarily on business and hardly speaks of politics and do not want to know anything about it. From 1940 onwards, Vögler was heavily involved with the manufacture of munitions. He served in increasingly important positions under Albert Speer in the Ruhr industrial heartland from 1942 until 1944. He helped rationalize armament production and indeed increase production at a time when Germany was clearly losing the war, following the loss of an army at Stalingrad, defeat at the Battle of El Alamein and at the Battle of Kursk. The armaments industry used much forced labour as well as slave labour so costs of manufacture were minimal. He was president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society (later Max Planck Society) from 1941 until his death in 1945. Nuremberg trials On 14 April 1945, in order to avoid capture by the US Army, Vögler committed suicide in Haus Ende, Herdecke. Despite his death, he was still identified as one of the defendants in the Nuremberg trials of prominent industrialists, which prosecuted the clique of businessmen who helped Hitler.

It is the eighth track on his first album, Empty Sky. It was originally released in August 1968 as a single on the Pye label by Guy Darrell and simultaneously by Roger James Cooke on Columbia Records. It was also recorded by Deep Feeling in 1970 (a band of which Guy Darrell was a member), Dana, Judith Durham, and Gene Pitney on his Pitney '75 album. Musical structure The original recording from the Empty Sky album has Elton John on harpsichord and organ. It is the only song on the album with John without other musicians. He wrote the song in the style of a hymn. The lyrics of the song are metaphorical — describing a pigeon that is flying high and free having been released from a human hand, with the line in the second verse, but most of all please free me from this aching metal ring, possibly revealing a human longing to be released from a broken marriage and set free to pursue new, truer dreams and ambitions — a theme that would reappear in 1975's Someone Saved My Life Tonight, using a similar metaphor of a butterfly flying free. Though there exists also the more literal interpretation of a war pigeon, as they were most commonly used to carry urgent messages in a small capsule affixed to the leg with metal bands, and carried on the backs of soldiers in small cages with a single wire door for the pigeon to look out of. 1972 version In 1972, John re-recorded the song with his band (Dee Murray, Nigel Olsson and Davey Johnstone) during the sessions for Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player. The new recording used piano instead of harpsichord, and strings and oboe arranged by Paul Buckmaster. Originally issued as the B-side of the hit-single \\"Daniel\\", it first appeared on CD in 1988 as part of the DJM issue of the Lady Samantha compilation album, then a few years later in the US and abroad on the 1992 Mercury release Rare Masters, and as a bonus track on the 1995 reissue of Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player. The 1972 version of Skyline Pigeon appears again on the third CD of John's 2017 compilation box set Diamonds. Performances \\"Skyline Pigeon\\" was played on the radio as early as 1968. It was the most popular song during the very early period of John's musical career, yet it was not released as a single. It is, however the most performed live and best known track from the Empty Sky album. The song was performed live in various eras and venues throughout John's career, mainly in Britain, and frequently during his solo shows and pairings with the percussionist Ray Cooper. John has always said he regards \\"Skyline Pigeon\\" as one of the first \\"great\\" songs that he and Taupin wrote. John performed the song at the funeral of the AIDS victim and friend Ryan White in 1990 on a grand piano, although he played Roland Piano on tour and in the studio at the time.Claude Bernardin (1995). \\"Rocket Man: The Encyclopedia of Elton John\\". p. 191. Greenwood Press, Apart from its earlier appearances on record, a live, solo piano version recorded at the Royal Festival Hall in London during summer 1974 was also included as the opening number on the \\"Here\\" side of the Here and There album in 1976, a place it retained in the 1995 2-CD expanded version remixed by the album's original producer Gus Dudgeon. It was also released on Volume 1 of two EltonJohn.com limited edition CDs recorded live in Madison Square Garden, as part of a series of solo performances John gave in October 1999. The song received a brief revival during a UK tour in 2009. The 1972 version was a hit in Brazil. A live performance from 17 January 2009 was broadcast on TV along with the rest of an entire concert John performed in São Paulo, Brazil. Again in Brazil in 2011, he played the song during a concert at Rock in Rio in front of 150,000 people in Rio de Janeiro, on 23 September. During the 2013 tour he played the song again in São Paulo, on 27 February, and in Porto Alegre, on 5 March.

Vacancy  The seat had become vacant when the Labour Member of Parliament William Kelly, had resigned his seat in Parliament by the procedural device of accepting the post of Steward of the Manor of Northstead, a notional 'office of profit under the crown'. Kelly had been Rochdale's MP since winning the seat from the Conservatives at the 1935 general election.  Candidates  The Labour Party candidate was Dr Hyacinth Morgan, a doctor born in the West Indies to Irish parents, who had studied medicine in Glasgow. After three unsuccessful attempts, he won the Camberwell North West seat at the 1929 general election, but lost it at the 1931 election. This was his first candidacy since his defeat. During the Second World War the political parties in the Coalition Government had agreed not to contest by-elections when a vacancy arose in any of the seats held by the other coalition parties. Although many later by- elections were contested by independent or minor party candidates, none were nominated in Rochdale.  Result  As there was only one candidate, no vote needed to be held, and Morgan was returned unopposed.  Aftermath  Morgan represented the constituency until the 1950 general election, when he moved to the safer seat of Warrington. Rochdale was won by the Conservatives at the 1951 election.

The Temple Wat Bang Phra Wat Bang Phra translates into English as the \\"Monastery of the Riverbank Buddha Image,\\" a reference to the temple's history as a spot where a revered Buddha image from Ayuthaya was recovered from a boat which sank in the Nakhon Chaisi River alongside where the monastery was founded.Cummings, Joe, Sacred Tattoos of Thailand: Exploring the Magic, Masters and Mystery of Sak Yan, Marshall Cavendish, 2015. History Wat Bang Phra dates to the late 18th century, just before the second fall of Ayutthaya. A small, elegant ordination chapel represents the only significant remains of the original monastery today. Inside sit two Buddha images, Luang Pho Sit Chaiyamongkon and Luang Pho Kai Sitmongkhon, which, according to legend, were being transported downriver from Ayutthaya to save them from plundering Burmese troops when the boat carrying them capsized. When the images were later pulled from the river, they were kept in the monastery that came to be known as Wat Bang Phra. The murals inside the original ordination hall demonstrate craftsmanship from the reigns of Kings Rama III and Rama IV. Former abbot Phra Udom Prachanart, more commonly known as Luang Phor Pern, was a famous meditation monk well known for his potent incantations and his knowledge of the body of Buddhist canons (Tripitaka) and most of all his mastery of protective sak yant (sacred Thai tattoos). Luang Phor Pern ordained as a monk at Wat Bang Phra at the age of 25 and studied with abbot Luang Pu Him Inthasoto, an accomplished sak yant master. Even though Luang Phor Pern had never been tattooed himself (and never would be), he took up the sacred art at Luang Pu Him's feet and carried on the tradition after Luang Pu Him died four years later. In 1953, feeling he needed further withdrawal, renunciation and solitary meditation, wandered in the forests of a remote area of Kanchanaburi Province on the Myanmar-Thailand border. Villagers in the area were beleaguered by wild tigers that had mauled or killed several locals. After Luang Phor Pern learned of the villagers’ predicament, he offered katha (incantations) and sak yant to protect them. He taught them that tiger yantras, in particular, could fend off attacks. From that point forward, no one who received the monk’s protection was ever attacked by a tiger or other wild animal, earning Luang Phor Pern a powerful reputation as a master of incantations and tattoos. Returning to Wat Bang Phra many years later, he was made abbot used temple donations to build a bridge over the adjacent river so that farmers could more easily bring their crops to market in Nakhon Chaisi or beyond, and constructed the local public hospital that today bears his name. As his reputation for wisdom and loving kindness grew, thousands of Thais travelled to Wat Bang Phra to receive the blessings of the great monk and to become his lifelong disciples. Many received sak yant from the abbot and the monks he assiduously trained. By the time Luang Phor Pern died in 2002 at the age of 79, he had become one of Thailand’s most well- known and beloved monastics. Because of Luang Phor Pern’s association with the border tiger legend, devotional images of the late monk today often depict him meditating on the back of a tiger. Daily tattooing The temple is also known for the daily tattoos or Sak Yants given by the monks that live there, and especially for the Wai Khru festival held on the temple grounds once a year during March, when disciples gather to pay respect to the spirit of Luang Pho Poen. The power of any amulet or tattoo decreases with time, so, to re- empower tattoos each year, Sak Yant masters celebrate with their disciples the Wai Khru (Wai Khru meaning to pay homage to one's teacher). On this day devotees gather in the parlours of their Sak Yant masters to honor them and get their tattoos blessed and re-empowered.Drouyer, Isabel Azevedo, Rene Drouyer, Thai Magic Tattoos, The Art and Influence of Sak Yant, Riverbooks, 2013. There are many articles found on the internet regarding the tattoo festival but very little information found regarding the day-to-day operations of the temple as described below. The process of receiving a tattoo from the monks at Wat Bang Phra outside of the events surrounding the tattoo festival are as follows: Before the tattoo Tattoo Selections on the temple wall A person wanting a tattoo will arrive at the temple around 8:00 AM. Before entering the temple, the person will purchase flowers and incense(70 Baht as of Feb 2011) as an offering to Buddha and to support the Wat. These offerings are then recycled back into the place where purchased and the money used for up-keep for the Wat. Upon removing your shoes and entering the Wat, a person will sit down in line. The offerings are kept in the center of the room. The tattoos are done in groups of about 20 people. When the previous group is complete, the monk blesses the next batch of offerings observed to be between 18 and 30. Tattoo options Luang Pi Nunn tattooing at Wat Bang Phra Upon entering the Wat, one of the first things a person sees on the wall is a very large banner of tattoos available. Unless there is a specific choice requested, the monk will begin with a simple tattoo at the top of the back. Daily tattooing Right before reaching the monk, the people next in line to the one being tattooed will assist the monk with holding the one receiving the tattoo still. The monk uses a single long thin needle about 18 inches in length and about four millimeters in width. The tip of the spike is split into two (like a split cane), so that each stab of the spike produces two dots of ink in the skin. There are about 8 of these needles in a pot of a type of cleaning solution. Sometimes the monk will sharpen the needle with fine grade sandpaper before beginning. The monk will then select from several different rubber templates with the design of choice. He will apply the template to ink and then press it on to the recipients back to transfer the design. When ready to begin, he will dip the tip of the needle into a mix of oil, probably palm oil, Chinese charcoal ink, and possibly snake venom. He then begins to trace the pattern. The typical tattoo takes about 3,000 strikes to complete. The monk dips the needle into the ink about every 30 seconds. When complete, he blesses the tattoo and blows a sacred Kata (Ghata) on it to infuse it with power. For men, the monk uses the charcoal ink. For women he uses a transparent ink and will use a glove in order to not touch the female body. Health The sanitation of the needle and ink are unknown. Receiving a tattoo at the Wat Bang Phra temple potentially exposes a person to HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C. There are approximately 580,000 people living with AIDS in Thailand. However, it is important to note that according to the \\"UNAIDS 2006 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic\\" there are no recorded cases of contracting HIV or AIDS from a tattoo needle due to the absence of a reservoir inside the needle containing enough blood to deliver the virus into the body to pass infection.

He was a founder and served as president, chief executive officer and chairman of Energy Research Corporation (now called FuelCell Energy, Inc.,FuelCell Energy in Danbury, Connecticut), developer and manufacturer of direct fuel cells (MCFC) used to generate electric power. Power plants based on his concepts are providing electricity in distributed generation locations throughout the world. Baker was known worldwide as an expert in electrochemical systems. He directed research in and development of various electrochemical power generation devices, including different types of fuel cells, batteries and hybrid systems. Baker's expertise encompassed fundamental research as well as the technological, engineering, system and marketing aspects of these systems, including \\"direct fuel cells\\", which can process hydrocarbon fuels such as natural gas without an external reformer. Baker received his bachelor's and master's degrees in chemical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania and was a post-graduate Fulbright fellow at the Laboratory for Electrochemistry of the University of Amsterdam, before earning a doctorate from the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1969. His doctoral thesis was also on fuel cell heat transfer and internal reforming. Before joining Energy Research Corporation, Baker was director of basic sciences at the Institute of Gas Technology in Chicago, where he directed research in the area of energy conversion and fuel cells. Before that, he was senior scientist at Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, Missiles & Space Division, where he was responsible for research on carbonate fuel cell systems and electrochemical kinetic studies. Baker is a major contributor to the field of fuel cell research, development and commercialization. He was issued 20 U.S. patents relating to fuel cells and other electrochemical systems. He authored more than 100 publications, including technical papers, books and symposia proceedings on the subject of fuel cells. In 1999, he received the Grove Medal, which was presented in conjunction with the Sixth Grove Fuel Cell Symposium 11th Grove Fuel Cell Symposium 2009 in London and is awarded to acknowledge an individual or company that has made valuable contributions toward the development and success of fuel cell technology. At the time of the award, the chairman of the Grove Symposium Steering Committee said: \\"Dr. Bernard S. Baker devoted his entire professional career to develop and promote fuel cells. In the beginning as a scientist, finally as a top manager he dealt with various fuel cells including alkaline, phosphoric acid and molten carbonate technologies. Dr. Baker personifies a remarkable combination of scientific capabilities and management skills. This unique blend enabled him not only to have many patents on fuel cell related inventions and to issue more than 100 fuel cell publications but to build up one of the world wide leading companies in the carbonate fuel cell technology.\\" Baker received the Cecil J.

Originally trained in civil engineering at Dartmouth College (BS 1908 & CE 1909), Rugg went on to study psychology, sociology and education at the University of Illinois where he completed a dissertation titled \\"The Experimental Determination of Mental Discipline in School Studies.\\" After earning his Ph.D. he went on to teach at the University of Chicago and later became a professor at Teacher's College at Columbia University. He studied the creativity which he believed was vital to the learning process. He created the first textbook series and his social studies books were extremely popular in US schools. By the early forties his books fell out of favor due to campaigns run by organizations like the Advertising Federation of America and the American Legion, due to Rugg's junior-high textbooks including concepts considered \\"pro-socialist\\" by conservative opponents. Biography Rugg was born on January 17, 1886 in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. Rugg went to school at Dartmouth College, where he received his bachelor of science in civil engineering in 1908 and his graduate degree in civil engineering in 1909. Rugg worked as a civil engineer before becoming a professor at Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois, where he became interested in how students learn. Rugg began teaching at the University of Illinois in 1911 and in 1915, Rugg submitted his dissertation, \\"The Experimental Determination of Mental Discipline in School Studies.\\" in order to attain his Ph.D. in education. During World War I, Rugg served as a member of the Army's Commission on Classification of Personnel under Charles H Judd. The commission is credited with testing adults for aptitudes and intelligence. Rugg used his wartime experience in educational statistics to study children's education. He taught at the University of Chicago from 1915 until January 1920, where he pioneered the application of quantitative methods to educational problems. In 1917, he published Statistical Methods Applied to Education and in 1926 published The Child-Centered School, which was an early influence on the progressive education movement. Rugg took a job at the Teachers College of Columbia University, where he stayed until he retired in 1951. While he was teaching at Columbia, Rugg became a spokesperson for the reconstructionist perspective, which viewed formal education as an agent of social change. His views were widely distributed, and Rugg has been credited with consolidating social sciences and creating a curriculum for the consolidated subject. He created the first series of an educational book, Man and His Changing Society, which was a junior high school social studies textbook that ran 14 volumes from 1929 until the early 1940s. Man and His Changing Society fell under scrutiny of the Advertising Federation of America and the American Legion for \\"pro-socialist ideas\\" because he illustrated the American society as having strengths and weaknesses. The Advertising Federation of America, or AFA, and the American Legion felt that these topics undermined the stability of American society. Many school districts pulled the textbook series subsequently starting censorship of his textbook. Rugg published Culture and Education in America in 1931, The Great Technology in 1933, and American Life and the School Curriculum in 1936. Each of these books discussed problems in American society and how school could solve them. In addition to emphasizing the social engineering philosophies of the reconstructionists, Rugg argued that individual integrity was vital to a good society and could be fostered by creative self-expression. Therefore, he championed the expansion of creative activities within school curriculum and would continue to research creativity after his retirement from Columbia in 1951. Rugg died at his home on May 17, 1960, in Woodstock, New York. Imagination was published posthumously in 1963 and was the crescendo of his research into the creative process. In 1922 he was elected as a fellow of the American Statistical Association.List of ASA Fellows, retrieved 2016-07-16.

The infection is characterized by craterlike pits on the sole of the feet and toes, particularly weight bearing areas. The infection is caused by Corynebacterium species bacteria and Kytococcus sedentarius. Excessive sweating of the feet and use of occlusive footwear provide an environment in which these bacteria thrive and therefore increase the risk of developing pitted keratolysis. The condition is fairly common, especially in the military where wet shoes/boots are worn for extended periods of time without removing/cleaning. Skin biopsy specimens are not usually utilized, as the diagnosis of pitted keratolysis is often made by visual examination and recognition of the characteristic odor. Wood's lamp examination results are inconsistent. Treatment of pitted keratolysis requires the application of antibiotics to the skin such as benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, or mupirocin. Prevention efforts aim to keep the feet dry by using moisture-wicking shoes and socks as well as antiperspirants.  History  Pitted keratolysis was first named keratoma plantare sulcatum. Epidemiology Pitted keratolysis occurs worldwide and in various climates. The infection is more common in people who live in tropical climates and walk barefoot, and those who spend a lot of time wearing occlusive footwear (e.g., tight shoes, rubber boots), such as in the military where wet shoes are worn for a prolonged period of time without removing and proper hygiene.  Signs and symptoms  Pitted keratolysis typically presents with white discoloration of the skin and numerous discrete, \\"punched-out\\" pitted lesions or erosions, usually located on the soles of the feet. The pits are typically 1-7 millimeters in diameter. These circular and shallow pits are characteristic of pitted keratolysis, and often overlap to produce larger areas of erosion. The appearance of this condition’s characteristic lesions becomes more pronounced when the affected area is wet or submerged in water. Occasionally these lesions present with a green or brown hue around and within the pits. These superficial erosions are found under the toes and on the soles of the feet, and especially at the pressure bearing points such as the heel. Typically, both feet are equally affected. Rarely, the condition affects the palms. Cause The most common cause of pitted keratolysis is Corynebacterium species. However, several other bacteria may also cause the condition, particularly Actinomyces keratolytica, Dermatophilus congolensis, Kytococcus sedentarius, and Streptomyces. Less frequently, it is due to Acinetobacter, Clostridium, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas species. Pathogenesis Pitted keratolysis is associated with excessive sweating of the palms or soles (palmoplantar hyperhidrosis.) The pits seen in pitted keratolysis are caused by bacteria secreting proteinase enzymes which cause the breakdown of the keratin proteins in the stratum corneum layer of the affected skin. This results in the formation of sulfur compounds which leads to a very strong and foul foot odor. The bacteria that cause pitted keratolysis thrive in warm and humid environments. Irritation is generally minimal, though occasionally burning, itching, and soreness are experienced with pitted keratolysis. Diagnosis The diagnosis of pitted keratolysis is based primarily on the physical examination, with recognition of the classic pitted lesions and pungent odor. Dermoscopic examination can facilitate visualization of pits and pit walls. A Wood's lamp may show coral red fluorescence, as seen in erythrasma. However, this finding is not uniformly present, as the condition may be caused by bacteria that do not produce fluorescent pigments. Further laboratory testing is not typically required for the diagnosis. However, a potassium chloride preparation can help rule out the presence of a fungal infection. Imaging and biopsy are not necessary.  Differential diagnosis  * Acid * Athlete's foot (Tinea pedis) * Erythrasma * Hyperhidrosis  Treatment  As of 2014, there is little high-quality evidence to provide guidance and support one treatment method over another. Therefore, the optimal treatment approach for pitted keratolysis remains unclear as the condition has not been well-studied. One review suggested a treatment approach requiring modification of risk factors (e.g., keeping feet clean and dry) and treating the underlying bacterial infection. Effective antibiotic options include clindamycin, erythromycin, mupirocin, and fusidic acid. Topical clindamycin is generally preferred as the first-line choice due to lower cost and better availability. Fusidic acid is preferred over mupirocin in most cases due to less resistance to fusidic acid amongst Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. Benzoyl peroxide is an effective alternative over-the-counter option and is thought to be as effective as topical clindamycin. Clinical cure was typically seen after 2.5-3 weeks. Oral antibiotics are not typically recommended. Foot hygiene is important. The feet may be washed at least daily with soap and water, and dried thoroughly afterwards. Moisture-wicking socks and shoes may be worn and antiperspirants, such as aluminum chlorohydrate, may help to keep the feet dry. Injections of botulinum toxin have successfully induced cessation of sweating (anhidrosis) of the soles of the feet and led to resolution of pitted keratolysis. These injections are typically reserved for refractory cases of pitted keratolysis that have failed to respond to environmental modifications and antibiotics due to the high cost and pain associated with botulinum toxin injections. Pitted keratolysis can be reduced and eventually stopped by regularly applying a liberal amount of antiperspirant body powder to the inside of the shoes and socks of the affected person. Regular powder application will greatly reduce foot perspiration and keep the plantar surface of the foot dry therefore creating an environment hostile to the Corynebacterium.

It is situated on the eastern shore of Kootenay Lake. It is 90 minutes from Nelson on the west shore, via the Kootenay Lake Ferry, known as the world's longest free ferry ride.  History  The settlement of Riondel developed around a very productive silver, lead and zinc mine, known as the Bluebell mine. In 1882 an American named Robert Sproule staked four claims along the Riondel Peninsula, including the Bluebell mine. When he left to register his claims, an Englishman, Thomas Hammill, re-staked the claims. In the following dispute, Sproule shot Hammill dead for stealing his claim. Sproule was convicted of homicide and executed on the gallows for his crime.  1890s  In the 1890s the settlement was known as Hendryx, after Wilbur Hendryx, who had control of the Bluebell mine and other claims in the mid-1880s. In 1905 The Canadian Metal Company purchased the mine. In 1907 the settlement was named Riondel after Count Edouard Riondel, the president of the Canadian Metal Company.  Pronunciation  Riondel is pronounced several different ways, even by locals: RYE-on-del and ree-ON-del are commonly heard. However, S.S. Fowler, who applied for the post office in 1907, wrote: “It is or should be pronounced Ree-on-del with accent very slightly on the first syllable,” as it was named after an ethnic French man.  Bluebell mine  The Bluebell mine operated from 1895 to 1929, during which period the population of Riondel was stable at around 70 people. With the closure of the Bluebell mine in 1929, the population dwindled. By 1943 there were only 22 people left in Riondel. In 1950 the Bluebell mine re-opened, and the population of Riondel soared to almost 300 people within three years. As the expansion of the Bluebell mine required more electricity, in 1952 Cominco built power lines across the Kootenay Lake, to bring power to the East Shore without the use of generators. Development included a smelter and a townsite. This mine has the longest history in the province of British Columbia.  1950-1972  From 1950, Riondel was a bustling, thriving mining town until 1972, when the Bluebell mine closed for good. Most people moved on to other nearby towns, while the older employees stayed in Riondel and retired. Riondel became a popular retirement community; at one time it had more seniors per capita than any other postal code in Canada.  1972-present  Today Riondel is a tidy village with streets, a lakeside campground, beach, community centre, playground, cable TV system, 9-hole golf course, grocery and liquor store, cafe, and pub. In April, 2006 Riondel was connected with dial-up internet provided by Telus.  Riondel Daze  During the weekend of the Civic Holiday, Riondel hosts an annual celebration called Riondel Daze. The Historical Society of Riondel usually has its vintage ambulance, a 1949 Mercury, at the event. Other elements are a ball tournament with a hot dog stand, local music, and a stand-still parade.  Location  Riondel is located on Riondel Road on the eastern shore of Kootenay Lake, 6 miles (10 km) north of Kootenay Bay, the eastern terminal of the Kootenay Lake ferry. Riondel is a 1-hour drive from Creston, British Columbia, and a 90-minute drive from Nelson, British Columbia, on the western shore, using the Kootenay Lake Ferry, known as the world's longest free ferry ride.  Hiking  *The Waterfront Trail in Riondel follows 1.5 km of the lakeshore from the south end of North Bay beach; *Pebble Beach Trail 7 km north of Riondel leads from the Kootenay Lake East FS Road to a south-facing, pebbled beach; *15-minute Pilot Bay Lighthouse Trail near Kootenay Bay leads to an historic 1907 lighthouse;The History of Pilot Bay Lighthouse on Kootenay Lake / Hulland, Susan, 1946-1997 *The one-hour Pilot Bay Marine Park Trail leads through varying terrain as it follows the lakeshore; *Plaid Lake Hiking Trail near Crawford Bay is a full-day hike to the alpine Plaid Lake on the west side of the Purcell Mountains; *Duck Lakes Dykes Trail near Sirdar offers miles of almost level hiking through some of the richest waterfowl habitat in British Columbia.  Golf  There are two golf clubs to choose from; the 9-hole, Par 3 course at the Riondel Golf Club, located on Galena Bay Wharf Road 10 minutes from the Kootenay Lake Ferry, and the 18-hole championship Kokanee Springs Golf Resort in Crawford Bay, a 20-minute drive to the south.  Fishing  Kootenay Lake maintains considerable populations of various fish species, including kokanee, rainbow and cutthroat trout, Dolly Varden, burbot, and whitefish. Kootenay Lake supports record-sized Rainbow Trout. The world's largest recorded kokanee - almost 10 pounds (4.5 kg) - was taken from Kootenay Lake. Kokanee (Kekeni) means 'red fish' in the Sinixt Interior Salish language. It is the name given to the land-locked salmon that spawn in large numbers in Kokanee Creek in the late summer. The best fishing time is in the fall and winter months.  Recreation  Other outdoor opportunities in Riondel include canoeing or kayaking the waters of the 75-mile long and 5-mile wide Kootenay Lake (rentals available), swimming, wildlife and nature viewing, boating and sailing, horsedrawn adventures, and backcountry exploration. A youth group at the Riondel Recreation Centre plays floor hockey on Sundays and other games such as pool and air hockey; they also have movies available. The Riondel Community Centre is located in a former school, and it has an auditorium for community events. The Centre houses the Riondel Art Club, the Riondel Seniors' Society, the Riondel Commission of Management, Riondel Community Library, and the Historical Society. Children may play on the playground outside.  Camping  The private Riondel Campground is located 1 km from the Riondel General Store. A second campground and RV park is located 12 km north of Riondel. References *Community of Riondel *Kootenay Lake Region *British Columbia  Further reading  * Bluebell Memories by A.

Early career Korsakov entered military service as a cadet in the Preobrazhinski Guard Regiment, and was appointed lieutenant colonel of the Tchernigov Musketeer Regiment at age 25. He fought in the Russo-Turkish War in 1788 and 1789, and in the Russo-Swedish War. He subsequently became a major-general of the Semenovsky Regiment of the Leib Guard and was assigned to accompany the Count of Artois to England. From there he went to Flanders as Russian observer to the army commanded by Prince Josias of Coburg. His account to the tsarina of the Battle of Fleurus (1794) won him favour; on returning to St. Petersburg, he was dispatched to serve under Count Valerian Zubov in an ill-fated expedition against Persia, which Emperor Paul I recalled in 1799 in order to deal with the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1797, Korsakov was elevated to inspector general of Infantry, and the following year, general lieutenant. 1799 campaign in Switzerland In 1798, Paul I gave Korsakov command of an expeditionary force of 30,000 men sent to Germany to join Austria in the fight against the French Republic. At the beginning of 1799, the force was diverted to drive the French out of Switzerland. Leaving Russia in May, Korsakov reached Stockach in 90 days. With 29,463 men, his command then marched to Zürich to join up with the 25,000-man corps of Austrian general Friedrich von Hotze. It was expected that Alexander Suvorov's army would join them from Italy after marching through the Alps, but terrain and enemy action held up Suvorov's advance. In the meantime, Korsakov waited near Zurich in a relaxed state of over-confidence.Furse, George Armand Marengo and Hohenlinden (2 vols 1903, facsimile edition Worley 1993 p. 80) Taking full advantage of this, the French under André Masséna attacked on 25 September 1799, in the Second Battle of Zürich, winning a signal victory and forcing Korsakov to withdraw rapidly to Schaffhausen, despite almost no pursuit by the French and orders from Suvorov for him to hold his ground. Korsakov then took up a position on the east of the Rhine in the Dorflingen Camp between Schaffhausen and Constance, remaining there while Masséna was left free to deal with Suvorov. His left under Condé was driven from Constance on 7 October, on the same day he advanced from Büsingen against Schlatt, but was eventually driven back by Masséna, abandoning his hold on the left bank of the Rhine. He joined Suvorov’s survivors at Lindau on 18 October, and was shortly after relieved of command. Soon after he was dismissed as colonel-in- chief of the Rostov Musketeer Regiment in disgrace. The combined army turned towards Bohemia, from where Paul I recalled the army back to Russia for the winter. Later career With the accession of Emperor Alexander I in 1801, Korsakov was re-appointed as a GvC cavalry general. He was Governor of Lithuania from 1806 to 1809, based at Vilna, and again from April to June, 1812. On the approach of the French he was ordered to withdraw by Barclay de Tolly on 28 June, but returned to serve for a third term as Governor-General of Lithuania from 8 December 1812 until 1830. During this time he ordered the reconstruction of the Tuskulėnai Manor in Vilnius, where he lived. Recalled to St. Petersberg after the Polish insurrection of 1830–31, Korsakov was made member of the State Council of Imperial Russia. He died in 1840.Mikaberidze, Alexander. 2005.

It is a loop off US 19; the southern terminus located in Mt. Lebanon and the northern terminus in McCandless Township, connecting to US 19 at both ends. The route is notable for a large, unorthodox interchange with the Penn- Lincoln Parkway (I-376/US 22/US 30) just west of the Fort Pitt Tunnel, where the route joins the Parkway and forms several wrong-way concurrencies, including one with its own opposing directions.Multiplexed Roads - Image of 5 route concurrency North of Pittsburgh, U.S. Route 19 Truck is called McKnight Road and south of Pittsburgh it carries West Liberty Avenue and Washington Road. Route description=Southern terminus to five-route concurrency Diagram showing the northbound / southbound Truck US 19 concurrency US 19 Truck begins as U.S. Route 19 enters Mount Lebanon along Washington Road. US 19 branches northwest to skirt Mt. Lebanon and Dormont, following Cochran Road, while US 19 Truck stays on Washington Road and continues through the centers of those towns. As US 19 Truck enters the southern parts of Pittsburgh, its name becomes West Liberty Avenue as it passes through the Beechview neighborhood. At the south portal of the Liberty Tunnel, US 19 Truck interchanges with Pennsylvania Route 51 (Saw Mill Run Boulevard) and joins it, following it north. After , US 19 Truck and PA 51 encounter the Penn-Lincoln Parkway, carrying I-376/US 22/US 30, at a complex, unorthodox interchange complex that stretches roughly half a mile along the Parkway and rests just south of the Fort Pitt Tunnel. Mainline US 19 also resides within this interchange, exiting the Parkway and traveling north to join PA 51. Here, US 19 Truck joins the Parkway. Northbound US 19 Truck exits PA 51 at a left exit, turning toward the westbound Parkway, which also contains a right-in/right-out ramp for Woodville Avenue. The ramp merges into the southbound US 19 mainline ramp, forming a wrong-way concurrency, but remains separated from the Penn- Lincoln Parkway via Jersey barrier. The ramp travels for roughly half a mile in this fashion before making a U-shaped curve. Before this ramp passes under the Parkway, it merges with southbound US 19 Truck (which exits the Penn- Lincoln Parkway from the Fort Pitt Tunnel), forming a wrong-way concurrency with itself. Mainline US 19 separates after the underpass and travels southbound as Banksville Road, and the ramp (carrying north and south US 19 Truck) curves northward, joining with the northbound US 19 mainline. The ramp now merges into the Penn-Lincoln Parkway, forming four lanes of I-376/US 22/US 30/both directions of US 19 Truck/US 19. After a short stretch, southbound US 19 Truck exits south at the next ramp, removing one lane from the Parkway, and after passing under PA 51, northbound mainline US 19 exits as well, also removing a lane. The Penn-Lincoln Parkway, now with both directions carrying I-376/US 22/US 30/US 19 Truck and in an orthodox orientation, enter the Fort Pitt Tunnel. Fort Pitt Tunnel to Interstate 279 Interchange After exiting the Fort Pitt Tunnel, US 19 Truck/I-376/US 22/US 30 cross the Monongahela River on the Fort Pitt Bridge, arriving on the Golden Triangle of downtown Pittsburgh. The route meets the southern terminus of Interstate 279 here, and I-376/US 22/US 30 head eastward, while US 19 Truck separates from them and joins I-279 on its northward trek. The two routes then cross the Allegheny River on the Fort Duquesne Bridge. North of the bridge, I-279 and US 19 Truck interchange with the southern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 65 at exit 1C of I-279. Exit 1B is to PNC Park and exit 1C is for Heinz Field. At exit 1D and 2A, I-279 southbound splits into HOV lanes at the Interstate 279 Interchange. The Interstate 279 interchange involves the northern terminus of Interstate 579 and the southern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 28. Exit 2 to northern terminus North of Exit 2B, I-279 has HOV lanes and continues its concurrency with US 19 Truck towards the north. At exit 4, US 19 Truck splits from I-279 and US 19 Truck continues towards the north at-grade as McKnight Road, a frequently congested divided highway known locally as McNightmare Road.: \\"McKnight Rd did not the nickname \\"McNightmare Rd\\" by mistake.\\" In Ross Township, US 19 Truck interchanges with Babcock Boulevard and shifts towards the northwest. The remainder of the route widens to six lanes, and heavily lined with shopping centers and large malls, including North Hills Village, Ross Park Mall, and McCandless Crossing. In McCandless Township, US 19 Truck interchanges with Ingomar Road. Northwest of Ingomar Boulevard, US 19 Truck turns west, paralleling and crossing Pine Creek before it terminates (ends) at a partial Y-interchange with U.S. Route 19. History The roadway was signed as US 19 from 1941 to 1948. The route was signed in 1946 as a bypass route for trucks that were not allowed on US 19. In 1948, the southern terminus was moved from Banksville Road to its current location. In 1989, US 19 Truck's designation was moved to I-279 to form a complete US 19 Truck from Mount Lebanon to Wexford after the Parkway North was completed. In 1997, construction began on the interchange at the southern portal of the Liberty Tunnel, and opened to traffic on November 20, 1999.Pennsylvania Highways - U.S. Route 19 Truck Major intersectionsSee also ReferencesExternal links *Multiplexed Roads - U.S. Route 19 Truck junction list Truck, Pittsburgh 19 Truck Pennsylvania Pittsburgh U.S. Highways in Pennsylvania Transportation in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Transportation in Pittsburgh ","title":"U.S. Route 19 Truck (Pittsburgh)"},{"id":"9582196","text":"Guy Owen (February 24, 1925 - July 25, 1981) was a professor of English who produced many different types of literary works. He was born in Clarkton, Bladen County, North Carolina, and grew up on a tobacco farm. Although his college education was interrupted by three years as an army private in Europe during World War II, he ultimately earned his bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Although he never returned there to live, his Depression-era boyhood in the Cape Fear region, spent accompanying his grandfather to auctions and clerking at his father's general store, informed his writing, providing him with a lifetime of material for his fiction and poetry. In the years between earning his M.A. and his Ph.D., Owen taught briefly at Davidson College and Elon College. During a four-year stint as an associate professor at Stetson University in Florida, he published his first poetry collection, and founded Impetus, the literary magazine which would evolve into the Southern Poetry Review. In 1960, he published his first novel, Season of Fear, a Depression-era story set in a rural community. The story of one man's struggle between religion and sex was critically well received, but its seriousness left Owen ready to write some lighter fiction. The Ballad of the Flim-Flam Man follows the comic adventures of an aging confidence man and his young AWOL sidekick in a thinly fictionalized Bladen County. Mordecai Jones and the guitar playing Curley Treadaway were to become two of Owen's favorite characters. The book was made into a movie in 1967 (The Flim-Flam Man) starring George C. Scott and Michael Sarrazin, and the characters reappeared in two more books to \\"con\\" the greedy and gullible who only get what they deserve. The 1970 novel Journey for Joedel won the Sir Walter Raleigh Award for best work of fiction by a North Carolinian. In 1962, Owen took a position at North Carolina State University. He continued over the years to publish stories and poems. His collection The White Stallion and Other Poems won a Roanoke-Chowan cup for poetry by a North Carolina poet. He co-edited several anthologies of state and regional verse, lectured and conducted workshops across the state for writers of all levels, participated in the \\"poetry in the schools\\" program, and directed the North Carolina Poetry Circuit, which brought together poets and college students. As a writer and teacher of writing, Guy Owen adhered to two principles. The first was specificity: \\"Never write 'flower': write 'rose' or 'marigold' or 'chrysanthemum.'\\" The second was \\"Make your reader comfortable,\\" meaning that a writer should give enough information in a clear style to enable the reader to easily enter the writer's world. Owen's many honors include a Bread Loaf Scholarship, the Henry H. Bellamann Foundation Award, a Yaddo Fellowship, and the 1971 gold medallion North Carolina Award for Literature. Owen died of liver cancer in Rex Hospital in Raleigh, North Carolina, at the age of 56.  Books and editorships  * The Ballad of the Flim-Flam Man.

As of 2015, Mackie Academy had roughly 1170 pupils and 80 teaching staff. The feeder primary schools are Arduthie, Bervie, Catterline, Dunnottar, Glenbervie, Gourdon, Johnshaven, Kinneff, Lairhillock, and Mill O'Forest. History The school was founded in 1893 thanks to the generosity of a local merchant, William Mackie, who bequeathed money in his will to establish a school in Stonehaven. The original site was on Arduthie Road, where Arduthie Primary school is now situated. The original building on this site was destroyed in a fire in the 1920s and had to be rebuilt. In 1969, the school was moved to the new purpose-designed building on the Slug Road. This land had previously been used as the Academy playing fields and the grounds around the present building are still used for this purpose. Between mid-2009 and late 2010 extensive work was carried out to the toilet facilities introducing 13 disabled toilets and 15 toilets. The school served a large geographical area surrounding Stonehaven until the opening of Portlethen Academy, which reduced the catchment area of the school drastically. After 2009, a large fence was erected around the school grounds. Pupil activities The school's pupils are divided into five different houses, which are derived from the surrounding geography of Stonehaven and historical local figures. These houses are Cowie, Dunnottar, Fetteresso, Swanley and Ury. Until 2014, a 6th house, Rickarton, was included in the school. However, this house was then disintegrated due to drops in pupil population and the retiring of Rickarton's guidance teacher.

The 13 miles (19 km) from Idaho Springs to SH 5 forms about half of the Mount Evans Scenic Byway. Route description The route begins at Idaho Springs, where it heads southwest away from the center of the city and follows the Chicago Creek. After exiting the city, the route begins climbing in elevation, ultimately reaching an elevation of about 10,000 feet, where it meets SH 5, at Echo Lake Park. Together with SH 5, the route to this point forms the Mount Evans Scenic Byway, the highest paved road in North America. Then the route continues through Squaw Pass, along the upper end of Echo Mountain Ski Area and on to its terminus at County Route 151. Past this point, the highway is not marked by CDOT, but the rest of what is called Squaw Pass Road descends toward Evergreen. History The route was established in 1923, where it began at US 285 and traversed to Idaho Springs. The segment east of Squaw Pass was renumbered in 1954, and the route was entirely paved by 1956.

Each was initially personally numbered and monogrammed by Buckethead himself. No two sets were the same, as the covers were hand-drawn and unique from one another. It is considered a special release, making it the first of Buckethead's albums to be referred to as such. According to Travis Dickerson, Buckethead's longtime producer: The original project started as an even more ambitious project than the one released. Dickerson explained that the project consisted of a series of 13-CD box sets that when completed and stacked would spell out the phrase \\"In Search of the Disembodied Sounds\\". However, due to the popular demand of this section of the project, the original idea was scrapped, as it became an exhausting endeavor to cover the demand for this box set. The original box set could be purchased as either a box set or separately. There are a total of 92 songs in the set ranging in length from 0:33 to 19:45, not including \\"Vol. 13: E\\" which is one unbroken 45-minute track. Buckethead drew the covers on each set of In Search of The until he reached the 1000th copy. However, mistakes were made in the numbering, and ranges of numbers were skipped during the production of the personalized edition of the box set. Dickerson estimates that the actual number of box sets produced might be around 800 copies with the final number written being 1000. All further copies available are no longer hand-made and feature the same artwork from set to set. Track listing=Notes *\\"Vol. 2, Track 1\\" samples the drumbeat from They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa! by Napoleon XIV. *\\"Vol. 2, Track 8\\" is identical to \\"Vol. 3, Track 2\\". *\\"Vol. 4, Track 4\\" contains an extended background beatbox session, possibly by Buckethead. *\\"Vol. 6, Track 1\\" (the second longest song in the boxset) is one impromptu guitar solo played over a continuous drum pattern. *\\"Vol. 7, Track 5\\" ends in 10 seconds of silence, possibly indicating that \\"Vol. 7, Track 6\\" is meant to be a hidden track. *\\"Vol. 10, Track 7\\" ends at 1:41, followed by an extremely low hum that is only heard when the volume is turned up. This remains until the end of the song. *\\"Vol. 11, Track 4\\" begins with a 1 minute, 25 second piano looping followed by guitar and drum work. *\\"Vol. 13, Track 1\\" is a single unbroken track and is Buckethead's single longest song. It has a 0:30 drum intro (laced with a bit of guitar buzzing) followed by a short pause, then the drumbeat from They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa! is sampled and plays for the entire remainder of the track. Atop this are typical Buckethead guitar solos incorporating pinch harmonics, distorted low notes and fast pick movements. At 26:52, with the drum beat still playing, the song changes to a more pleasant and less complex tone, reminiscent of Buckethead's earlier song \\"I Love My Parents\\". Then, without warning, the song pulls straight back into frenetic soloing at 28:58. *Vols. 4, 10 & 11 are the only albums in the set not to contain a song longer than ten minutes. However, Vols. 4 & 10 both contain tracks between nine and ten minutes. Vol. 11's longest track length is just 6:10. This would also explain the fact that, at eleven tracks, Vol. 11 has more tracks than any of the other albums. It is also the only volume in the set to have a double digit track amount.

It was produced by Jack Cummings and directed by Roy Del Ruth. The film was originally announced as Broadway Melody of 1944 to follow MGM's Broadway Melody films of 1929, 1936, 1938, and 1940. It was originally slated to star Eleanor Powell and Gene Kelly, but Louis B. Mayer and MGM loaned Kelly out to Columbia to play opposite Rita Hayworth in Cover Girl (1944). The film instead starred George Murphy, who had appeared in Broadway Melody of 1938 and Broadway Melody of 1940. Mayer then replaced Powell with Ginny Simms. Other cast members included Charles Winninger, Gloria DeHaven, Lena Horne, Nancy Walker, Eddie \\"Rochester\\" Anderson, the Ross Sisters, and Ben Blue, as well as Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra. Plot Murphy plays a successful Broadway musical comedy producer named Johnnie Demming. He needs a star for his new show. He's smitten with the glamorous film star, Helen Hoyt (Simms), and offers the part to her, but she turns him down because she wants to be sure she's in a hit. Johnnie's father (Winninger), retired from vaudeville, wants to do his own show. He gets his daughter, Patsy (DeHaven) and also Helen. Johnnie feels betrayed by his father. The film is very loosely based on the Broadway musical Very Warm for May (1939). However, all the songs from the musical except for \\"All the Things You Are\\" were left out of the film.

Early life and education Born in New York City, Taddeo Gargiulo was the son of immigrant parents Salvatore Gargiulo, a baker from Sorrento, and Erminia Mascia from Castellamare di Stabia, Italy. During the Great Depression, Theodore discovered his passion for the piano and found a way to begin his studies. His talent and pursuit led to a scholarship to the Manhattan School of Music. As he studied music theory and harmony, he was asked to join the National Youth Administration Symphony under the direction of Leopold Stokowski, where he expanded his knowledge of orchestration and composition. In 1935, he received another scholarship from the New York Philharmonic Symphony Society and studied under a pupil of Rimsky-Korsakoff. He was asked to be a part of the Simeon Bellison Clarinet Ensemble, where he played bass clarinet. His concentration here continued to be harmony and composition. An original Romanza and his arrangement of Borodin’s On the Steps of Central Asia received a monetary prize and was performed by the ensemble at Town Hall on April 28, 1938 to standing ovations. He continued to do music in New York City and was writing, arranging and leading the Coro d’Italia to three gold cups at the 1939 New York World's Fair. According to one of New York’s newspapers, \\"Thirty-two nations joined hands in bringing colorful songs and dances of the old world to the world of tomorrow…The talent and grace of the young and old performers all costumed was something the huge crowd will never forget. The show lasted over seven hours.” He also studied vocal arts at Teachers’ College of Columbia University. Maestro Fritz Stiedry of the Metropolitan Opera embraced him as his protégé. Here his passion grew deeper in the world of opera. Career Sponsored by the City of New York, the Department of Parks, and local 802 A.F.M., Gargiulo conducted a series of outdoor summer concerts called “Live Music for Millions.” Subsequent years found Maestro Gargiulo performing as Music Director, Assistant Conductor and Conductor with opera companies such as the Miami Opera Guild, Wagner Opera Company’s National Tour, New York Opera Festival in Washington, DC, Cafarelli Opera in Cleveland, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Columbus Symphony Orchestra in Columbus, Georgia, the Connecticut Opera Association, the Philadelphia Opera and the Cincinnati Summer Opera. As a member of the Sacred Musical Service in New York City he was a freelance choir master, organist and pianist. Theodore’s last international conducting tour included the symphony orchestra of Ottawa, Vancouver and other cities in Canada. These orchestras provided accompaniment to the four hour silent film epic of the restoration of Abel Gance’s 1927 classic Napoleon produced by Francis Ford Coppola. He was chief music critic, reviewer and feature writer for the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer newspapers for seven years and his articles appeared in many publications. The Gargiulo family came to Monterey in 1972. He organized the Peninsula Clarinet Quartet for the Monterey Museum of Art and established the chamber concert series, \\"Music in the Museum.\\" Colonel Moskowitz, and Theodore organized the Pan Cultural Orchestra of the Defense Language Institute (DLI). The orchestra performed concerts in Steinbeck Forum and throughout the community. With Specialist Bill Zornes, a student from the Russian Department, Theodore wrote a pageant to celebrate the Army’s 208th Birthday Ball, \\"Music – the Great Motivator.\\" Interspersed with narration, the pageant revealed how music has inspired patriotism throughout history. It was described as a \\"spine thrilling performance.\\" In November 2001 Maestro Gargiulo received a lifetime achievement award at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. The award was presented by the Licia Albanese – Puccini Foundation. Maestro Gargiulo was a prolific composer with a collection of art songs in various genres, symphonic works, chamber music, a wedding mass, and two operas. One of his last commissions was a popular romantic ballad titled Tehama Monterra Now and Forever and recorded on CD with a chamber orchestra. On August 30, 2006 Maestro Gargiulo composed his last composition, a musical setting of the Credo from the Catholic mass. Family Theodore married Gloria Moschella in September 1959. They have two children, Franca Gargiulo and Terrence Gargiulo. Occhiata Productions (aka Occhiata Foundation) was founded by Franca and Terrence Gargiulo in honor of their father. The mission of Occhiata is to bring opera and music opportunities to underserved schools in Monterey County and surrounding Central Coast areas.

Biography Harald Prins was born in the Netherlands and is a University Distinguished Professor of anthropology at Kansas State University. Academically trained at various universities in the Netherlands, where he studied prehistoric archaeology, history, and cultural anthropology, among others under Anton Weiler, Albert Trouwborst, Anton Blok, and Ton Lemaire, he completed his at the Radboud University Nijmegen (1976). After two years as an assistant professor in theoretical history at its graduate program, he came to New York City under the auspices of the Netherlands-America Institute in 1978.

As such, she is the older sister of Emperor Emeritus Akihito. She married Takamasa Ikeda on 10 October 1952. As a result, she gave up her imperial title and left the Japanese Imperial Family, as required by law. Later, she served as the most sacred priestess (saishu) of the Ise Grand Shrine between 1988 and 2017. Biography Princess Atsuko was born at the Tokyo Imperial Palace on 7 March 1931, her father is the Emperor Showa (Hirohito), her mother is the Empress Kojun. Her childhood appellation was . She had three elder sisters, the Princess Shigeko Teru-no-miya, the Princess Sachiko Hisa-no-miya (died as a baby) and the Princess Kazuko Taka-no-miya. As with her elder two sisters, she was not raised by her biological parents, but by a succession of court ladies at a separate palace built for her and her elder sisters in the Marunouchi district of Tokyo. She graduated from the Gakushūin Peer’s School, and was also tutored along with her siblings in English language by an American tutor, Elizabeth Gray Vining during the American occupation of Japan following the World War II. She graduated from Gakushuin University Women's College in March 1952. Atsuko and Takamasa Ikeda on 10 October 1952 On 10 October 1952, Princess Yori married Takamasa Ikeda, the eldest son of former Marquis Nobumasa Ikeda and a direct descendant of the last daimyō of Okayama Domain, whom she had met at a Japanese tea ceremony at Kōraku-en gardens. The couple were engaged after only six months, but wedding plans had to be postponed due to the death of her grandmother Empress Teimei in 1951 and subsequent period of mourning. Upon her marriage, Princess Yori became the second daughter of an emperor to relinquish her status as a member of the Japanese imperial family and become a commoner upon marriage, in accordance with the 1947 Imperial Household Law. The groom's father and the bride's mother, the Empress, were first cousins, making the couple second cousins. The former princess relocated to Okayama Prefecture, where her husband, a wealthy cattle rancher, served as director of the Ikeda Zoo outside of Okayama city for over fifty years. In 1965, she was hospitalized with sepsis, which was a cause of great concern for the Imperial Family, as her elder sister Shigeko Higashikuni had already died of stomach cancer. In October 1988, Ikeda succeeded her ailing elder sister, Kazuko Takatsukasa, as the most sacred priestess (saishu) of the Ise Shrine. She served in that capacity until 19 June 2017, whereupon she was succeeded by her niece, Sayako Kuroda.Japan Times She also served as the Chairperson of the Association of Shinto Shrines until June 2017.

He received both his BA and MD degrees from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, taught previously at both the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University, and was Chief of Psychiatry at both Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston during formative periods in psychiatry for each institution.Leon Eisenberg papers, 1905-2009 (inclusive), 1968-2005 (bulk). HMS c196. Harvard Medical Library, Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine, Boston, Mass. Medical accomplishments The reasons Leon Eisenberg is listed as a famous figure in world and American psychiatry are numerous; here are eight select reasons. Leon Eisenberg identified rapid return to school as the key to treatment in the management of the separation anxiety underlying school phobia. He completed the first outcome study of autistic children in adolescence and recognized patterns of language use as the best predictor of prognosis. Of the two first studies of the outcome of infantile autism, he reported the American study in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 1956, and the UK study was reported in JCPP shortly afterward by Victor Lotter and Sir Michael Rutter. That was a time when a narrow rather than a broad definition of autism was in fashion. It is of interest that the poor prognosis was evident both in the narrowly and broadly defined cases and that, because many of the cases now called autistic would have been called \\"mental retardation: moderate to severe\\", they would have joined other such children with a relatively poor outcome. He was Principal Investigator (PI) on the first grant from the Psychopharmacology Branch of NIMH for RCTs in child psychopharmacology. From a concern for evidence-based care, well before the phrase was coined, he introduced randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in psychopharmacology and showed that \\"tranquilizing\\" drugs were inferior to placebo in the treatment of anxiety disorders, whereas stimulant drugs were effective in controlling hyperactivity. He completed the first RCTs of psychiatric consultation to social agencies and of the utility of brief psychotherapy in anxiety disorders. He published a forceful critique of Konrad Lorenz's instinct theory. He established the usefulness of distinguishing \\"disease\\" from \\"illness\\". He has highlighted the environmental context as a determinant of the phenotype emerging from a given genotype, and from the late 1990s through 2006, he had been involved with developing conferences and resources for medical educators in various specialties that would help them incorporate, into courses with their current and future students, the tidal wave of new information in genomics yet to puzzle future clinicians. This interest may have been encouraged by his stepson, Dr. Alan Guttmacher, then Acting Head of the National Human Genome Research Institute. For many decades, Leon Eisenberg had criticized psychoanalysis from a number of platforms. The scientific contributions of Dr. Eisenberg include: * the first longitudinal follow-up of Leo Kanner's original cases of autism * a study that identified the roots of social phobia in parental anxiety * the first clinical trial of the effectiveness of psychiatric consultation in a social agency * the first randomized controlled trial in childhood psychopharmacology * the first randomized controlled trial of stimulant drugs in adolescents * the first randomized clinical trial of brief psychotherapy * a forceful critique of Lorenz's theory of instincts and imprinting * an early statement of the distinction between \\"disease\\" (what doctors deal with) and \\"illness\\" (what patients suffer) * a widely cited critique of the oscillation of psychiatry between brain-centered and mind-centered approaches arguing for the integration of the two * a synthesis of the evidence on the importance of training primary care physicians to recognize and treat depression * papers that highlight the molding of the brain structure by social experience * publications putting inheritance in an environmental context as a determinant of risk and resilience. * Called \\"the father of prevention science in psychiatry\\"Video of the announcement of the Leon Eisenberg Chair in Psychiatry at Children's Hospital Boston, in which Dr. William Beardslee, a colleague, notes the grounds for Eisenberg's being considered the founder of preventive psychiatry Specific publications referring to the above achievements are contained in his bibliography Leon Eisenberg was proudest of the Diversity Lifetime Achievement Award he received in 2001 for his role in inaugurating affirmative action at HMS in 1968 and sustaining it as Chairman of the Admissions Committee from 1969 to 1974. He regards that as his most important contribution to Harvard Medical School. He and his wife, Dr. Carola B. Eisenberg, former Dean of Students, first at MIT, then at Harvard Medical School, had been active with Physicians for Human Rights, which as an organization received a Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for its International Campaign to Ban Landmines. In mid-2009 (June 22, 2009), a Leon Eisenberg Chair in Child Psychiatry was named at Children's Hospital Boston. The first chairholder of the Leon Eisenberg Professorship in Child Psychiatry is David R. DeMaso, MD, HMS Professor of Psychiatry and Psychiatrist-in-Chief at Children's Hospital Boston. His brief (~30 pages) autographical memoir (a walk through the history of psychiatry) was published posthumously by Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica - in mid- or late-2010) \\"Were we asleep at the switch?\\" [See below] was written from his home. Humor Among his friends and professional colleagues, Leon Eisenberg was known for his humor and friendly wit which he shared in lectures, publications, and even as Recording Secretary for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (sometimes in the form of haiku).AmAcad Attendees at the Annual Leon Eisenberg Award at the Harvard Faculty Club in Cambridge, Massachusetts, end the evening - after the Awardee's lecture - with informal sharing of 'Leon's jokes to the best of our memories.' White it's often assumed that these quips and stories were Eisenberg originals, research shows that many if not most - or even all - 'had a prior history' (sometimes a very long history). One example of 'an original' related to healthcare and medicine is: > The embarrassingly poor outcomes of the painfully expensive US healthcare > system can be summed up in the words of Dolly Parton, \\"It costs a lot of > money to look this cheap!\\" Collecting his humor is difficult (often it was in personal e-mails), but many agree that a few typical scenarios recurred: * Several persons of different social backgrounds involved in a difficult, odd, or even humorous situation, usually with a Jewish psychiatrist or a rabbi [often exploring social nuances and varying or even contrasting perceptions]. * A very wise person involved with something very unusual [e.g. Chinese mathematician sipping tea (often a tale about moral outrage)]. * A well-known historical event [e.g. The last survivor of the Johnstown Flood (about humility before highly accomplished and esteemed professional colleagues)].This story was retold by colleague Dr. Arthur Kleinman at the announcement of the Leon Eisenberg Chair at Children's Hospital Boston, between 1:13:00 and 1:14:00. However, the late Senator Ted Kennedy is also credited with this story. David. Teaching flood preparedness to Noah. It's Not a Lecture: A blog by Wescott Strategic Communications.

Former President of Case Institute of Technology (then Case-Western Reserve), Dr. Edward M. Hundert, while he was a medical student (class of 1984) at Harvard Medical School, played the part of Leon Eisenberg in the HMS Class Folies, in which (as his character) he sang the supposedly satirical but actually most complimentary tune, \\"I feel witty!\\" Death Leon Eisenberg died of prostate cancer at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts on September 15, 2009.Benedict Carey, Dr. Leon Eisenberg, Pioneer in Autism Studies, Dies at 87 The New York Times.

He was typically among the first thought and invited to such committees because of his breadth. Attempts to identify a full set of such committees are proceeding. Themes of most recent writing Leon Eisenberg is credited by numerous colleagues with \\"simple and direct\\" prose (Arthur Kleinman, Norma Ware, etc.). He will be remembered most for his writings in these areas, though his encyclopedic comprehension reached much more broadly: * Evidence- based medicine ** Capacity of academics to accept ideas that are absurd and later rejected * Why and how did psychoanalysis come to be so dominant for so long (the triumph of psychopharmacology over psychotherapy and changes in the way care was financed) has been explored repeatedly, but outlined here in two papers for different Josiah Macy Conferences: ** \\"Modern Psychiatry: Challenges in Educating Health Professionals to Meet New Needs\\" ** \\"The Challenge of Neuroscience: Behavioral Science, Neurology, and Psychiatry\\" * Diagnostic classifications (see below) - a theme continued from the very beginning of his career * Human rights of patients * Conflict of Interest (COI) in the Practice of Psychiatry and Medicine ** Issues in rewriting the entire psychiatric taxonomy at one time (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders = DSM): COI, empirical evidence to support DSM changes, timing of revisions ** Complicity of the medical and psychiatric professionals in torture. ** Criticizing the replacement of patient interests with the profit motive in healthcare.Eisenberg, L. Marketplace Medicine: Prescription for Disaster. Academe: Bulletin of the American Association of University Professors 1999;85:26-30 ** The relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and medical education through sponsorship and educational programs. * Integration of genetics in health professional educationA series of annual conferences on the future of integrating the avalanche of genetics research results from biomedical research in health professional education was sponsored by the Josiah Macy Foundation and coordinated from Leon Eisenberg's office at Harvard Medical School * Resolving the conflict between integrative medicine and evidence-based biomedicineEisenberg, L. 2000.

Sponsored by Josiah Macy Foundation.Eisenberg, L. 2002. Complementary and Alternative Medicine: What Is Its Role? Harvard Review of Psychiatry, 10(4), pp. 221-230. Published online: 03 Jul 2009 Later autobiographical reflections: \\"Were We Asleep at the Switch?\\" Leon Eisenberg had written from his home a 'mini-autobiography' which he named \\"Were We Asleep at the Switch?\\".Leon Eisenberg and Laurence B. Guttmacher, Were we all asleep at the switch? A personal reminiscence of psychiatry from 1940 to 2010, Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, 2010, vol. 122, Issue 2, pp. 89-102 Eisenberg suggested that a switch from 'mind' to 'body' has taken place in psychiatry as a discipline, which led to overuse of medication. He also argued that, while medical scientists were worrying about the tedious science at the base of medical practice and healthcare decisions for the general public, \\"money\\" and monied interests had been making de facto decisions for the populace about how things that affected them deeply were going to be done. In this view, the overwhelming impact of economic considerations over emerging bodies of expert knowledge may have rendered and might continue to render futile the professional contributions of many brilliant, timely, and concerned working scientists. A 2012 article in the German weekly publication Der Spiegel gives an account of an interview Eisenberg gave in 2009, seven months before his death. It quotes him as saying, \\"ADHD is a prime example of a fabricated disease. ... The genetic predisposition to ADHD is completely overrated.\\" Instead of prescribing a 'pill', Eisenberg said, psychiatrists should determine whether there are psychosocial reasons that could lead to behavioral problems.Jörg Von Blech, Schwermut ohne Scham, Der Spiegel, 2012, Issue 6 Earliest papers * Bazett HC, Love L, Newton L, Eisenberg L, Day R, Forster R.

Biography Davoli was born in San Pietro a Maida, Calabria. He was discovered by poet, novelist and film director Pier Paolo Pasolini, who had begun a relationship with Davoli, then a 15-year-old boy, in 1963. Pasolini considered him to be \\"the great love of his life\\", and he later cast him in his 1966 film Uccellacci e uccellini (literally Bad Birds and Little Birds but translated in English as The Hawks and the Sparrows), co-starred with celebrated comic Totò, Pasolini became the youth's mentor and friend. \\"Even though their sexual relations lasted only a few years, Ninetto continued to live with Pasolini and was his constant companion, as well as appearing in six more of his films.\\" First cast in a non-speaking role in the film Il vangelo secondo Matteo (The Gospel According to St. Matthew, 1964), Davoli played mostly comical-naïve roles in several more of Pasolini's films, the last of which was Il fiore delle Mille e una Notte (A Thousand and One Nights/Arabian Nights, 1974). After Pasolini's death in 1975, Davoli turned increasingly to television productions. In May 2015 Davoli was announced as recipient of a special Nastro d'Argento Career Award.

Berner Middle School is a middle school that serves Massapequa, New York since 1987 after the conversion from Berner High School. The school was named after Alfred G. Berner, who served on the Board of Education from 1945 to 1954. The campus currently serves students in grades 6-8 that matriculate to Massapequa High School. History Berner High School opened in January 1962 as a junior high school under principal Donald Woodworth. Half of that year's 9th and 10th grade students attending Massapequa High School were assigned to Berner High School for the 1962-1963 school year and the school's enrollment peaked in the early 1970s. After a decline in district enrollment from a high of 17,000 students in 1970 to 7,800 by 1986, Berner High School closed in 1987.Schmidt, Catherine (1986-08-03). \\"If You're Thinking Of Living In; Massapequa\\". The New York Times. There is currently no talk of returning the middle school's status to a high school, though it is possible that many of the schools in the Massapequa Union Free School District system may exchange uses, due to the rising adolescent population in both Massapequa and Massapequa Park. In February 2016, the Massapequa School District's Board of Education voted to move the district's 6th graders into Berner starting in the 2017-2018. Unfortunately, the move was reversed in a 3-2 vote in July 2017, leaving the people against the move happy and the people for the move upset. The July vote was the result of many angry parents against the move attending the regular Board of Education meeting in May. The Board of Ed agreed to vote on the 6th graders again in July and if the move was still going on, a public vote would have taken place in January 2018 to decide if the next incoming 6th grade class and future classes were to go to Berner or to remain at the Elementary level for 6th grade. Unfortunately, that was not the case since Board of Ed members Timothy Taylor, Brian Butler, and Joseph LaBella voted against the move. LaBella, who was originally voted for the move, changed sides in this vote due to him receiving many emails from angry parents. He was considered \\"The Middle Man\\" in this vote since 2 members voted against (as mentioned above) and the remaining 2 members, Marianne Fisher and Gary Baldinger, voted for the move. Incoming 6th graders protested to get their class back into Berner Middle School, as they have already graduated and had their festivities for their graduation. Even though people think that nothing could be done after creating an online petition and protesting in front of the BOE office, the Board of Education received a stay from the NYS Department of Education on August 1, 2017 that requires them to leave the move as is and let the 6th graders go where they all wish to be, at Berner. It was officially decided at the August 3, 2017 regular board meeting that the 6th graders will be going to Berner in September 2017. At the meeting, the Board of Ed was considering to get into legal affairs with the power of attorney to once again try and reverse this move. All four of the Baldwin brothers are Berner alumni.Sottili, Carol (2001-08-15). \\"Tawkin' 'Bout My Generation: The Long Island Star Factory\\". Washington Post: C02. Campus The former high school's athletic facilities, including a track, football field, and tennis courts, have mostly fallen into disrepair. In summer of 2016, the Massapequa Board of Education elected to renovate the athletic facilities at Berner due to the disrepair of the facilities over the years. The north soccer field is still often used by the Long Island Junior Soccer League for the Massapequa Soccer Club's travel teams, but the south soccer field is often torn up due to constant use by middle school students during the soccer and football seasons. It is also used heavily for adult leagues and unsanctioned soccer games during the weekends. The tennis courts have recently been torn down and they have built a new softball field there instead.

Reifsndyer, the 1957 recipient of the Maxwell Award for College Player of the Year, coached at least two of the Baldwin brothers, Alec and Daniel. Under Reifsnyder, the football Bisons won the South Shore (Long Island) championship in 1971 and made it to the Nassau County Conference I-II championship game in 1974 (lost to Syosset).

History The first Aomori Airport was opened in 1964, in the town of Namioka, with a single 1200 x 30 meter runway designed for use with the NAMC YS-11 aircraft. The airport was located at an altitude of 200 meters in a valley surrounded by mountains, which hampered operations during inclement weather. The runway was lengthened to 1350 meters in 1971, widened to 45 meters in 1972, and extended to 1400 meters in 1973. The terminal building was expanded in 1974, and again in 1978. However, due to the geographic limitations of the existing site, design work began on a new airport at its present location southwest of downtown Aomori. The new facilities opened in 1987 with a single 2000 x 60 meter runway, with an ILS system. The runway was extended to 2500 meters in 1990. All Nippon Airways began operations to Tokyo from 1994. In 1995, the airport terminal building was remodeled, and certified as suitable for international operations. Korean Air began operations to Seoul and Siberian Airlines to Khabarovsk the same year. In 1998, Air Nippon began operations to Sendai Airport. However, usage of Aomori Airport fell short of projections, and the service was canceled after a year. In April 2003, All Nippon Airways withdrew from operations at Aomori as well, turning its routes over to Skymark Airlines, which in turn ceased operations to Aomori from November of the same year. Siberian Airlines stopped its flights to Aomori in 2004. The runway was extended to 3,000 meters in 2005, and the instrument landing system upgraded to handle Cat-3a fog conditions in 2007. The Tōhoku Shinkansen high-speed rail line was extended to Aomori in 2010, adding intense competition on the Aomori-Tokyo route. Aomori Prefecture has been considering the privatization of the airport since 2012. On 17 July 2019, EVA Air began operating two flights per week between Aomori and Taoyuan International Airport. Facilities=Runways Aomori Airport has one runway that is aligned in a northeast to southwest heading. The runway gets covered in an average of snow annually. The 38-vehicle White Impulse snow removal crew gets rid of the snow covering the airport's runway, taxiway, and apron; an area covering , in 40 minutes. Ground transportation The airport is serviced by scheduled bus service to central Aomori and Hirosaki; taxis and rental cars are also available. Airlines and destinationsIncidents * Two United States Air Force F-16 Falcon fighter jets on a training flight from nearby Misawa Air Base made an emergency landing at Aomori Airport on April 26, 2010 due to engine troubles. In a similar incident several years later, two F-16s from Misawa made an emergency landing at Aomori Airport on April 15, 2015 due to an engine oil leak on one of the aircraft; Aomori Governor Shingo Mimura demanded that the U.S. military take measures to prevent a recurrence.

Description My Ladye Nevells Booke consists of 42 pieces for keyboard by William Byrd, widely consideredThe New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd edition (29 volumes, 2001) one of the greatest English composers of his time. Although the music was copied by John Baldwin, a singing man from St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, who was also paid for copying music at the chapel in the 1580s,Hilary Gaskin, \\"Baldwin and the Nevell hand\\" in Byrd Studies (Cambridge University Press 1992), 159–173 the pieces seem to have been selected, organised and even edited and corrected by Byrd himself. A heavy, oblong folio volume, it retains its original elaborately tooled Morocco binding, stamped with the title, on top of a nineteenth century repair. The illuminated coat of arms of the Neville family is on the title page, with the initials \\"H.N.\\" in the lower left-hand corner. There are 192 leaves each consisting of four six-line staves with large, diamond-shaped notes. At the end is a table of contents. History John Harley has established the dedicatee as Elizabeth Bacon (c.1541 – 3 May 1621), eldest daughter of Queen Elizabeth's Lord Keeper Sir Nicholas Bacon (1510–1579), by his first wife, Jane Ferneley (d.1552), the daughter of William Ferneley of Suffolk.; . Elizabeth Bacon was the third wife of Sir Henry Neville of Billingbear House, Berkshire,. whose arms on the title page have now been identified. Thomas Morley also dedicated a book to her (as Lady Periam). Harley has postulated some reasons for the inception of the book, but nothing firm has been established. Sir Henry and his family were not Catholics, but his son Henry's association with Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex is evidence that the family may have been in favour of religious tolerance. The date of the manuscript however leaves no doubt, as it was signed as completed by the scribe John Baldwin in Windsor with the following colophon: > finished & ended the leventh of September in the yeare of our lorde god 1591 > & in the 33 yeare of the raigne of our sofferaine ladie Elizabeth by the > grace of god queene of Englande etc, by me Jo. Baldwine of windsore. laudes > deo. Baldwin was a fervent admirer of Byrd: at the end of the fourth galliard he noted: \\"mr. w. birde. homo memorabilis\\", and in his commonplace book,Baldwin Commonplace Book (ca. 1580–1606), GB-Lbl RM 24 d. 2 he wrote a poem praising Byrd, \\"whose greate skill and knowledge doth excelle all at this tyme / and farre to strange countries abroade his skill dothe shyne\\" Elizabeth Neville must have been closely associated with Byrd, whether as pupil or patron is not known, but the book was most probably a gift to her. She lived principally at Hambleden in Buckinghamshire, near to where Byrd and his brothers had a home. At some time it was presented to Queen Elizabeth by Sir Henry Neville, and then passed through various hands until it was given back in 1668 to an unknown Neville descendant. The book was preserved by the Neville family until the end of the eighteenth century, when it passed through several collectors' hands until it returned to the possession of William Nevill, 1st Marquess of Abergavenny. In 2006 it was accepted by HM Government in lieu of Inheritance Tax, and allocated to the British Library. In 2009 the British Library digitised the manuscript and made it available as a virtual book on its website. It has also been published in facsimile.British Library MS Mus. 1591 with an introduction by Oliver Neighbour (Kassel, Bärenreiter, 2012) Contents (Spelling as in the score's pages or in the index – there are some minor differences.) #my ladye nevells grownde #Qui paſse: for my ladye nevell #the marche before the battell #the battell ##the souldiers sommons ##the marche of footemen ##the marche of horsemen ##the trumpetts ##the Irishe marche ##the bagpipe and the drone ##the flute & the drõme ##the marche to the fighte – tantara tantara – the battels be ioyned ##The retreat #the galliarde for the victorie #the barlye breake #the galliard gygg #the huntes upp #vt re mi fa sol la #the first Pavian #the galliarde to the same #the seconde pavian #the galliarde to the same #the third pavian #the galliarde to the same #the fourth pavian #the galliarde to the same #the fifte pavian #the galliarde to the same #the sixte pavian [Kinbrugh Goodd] #the galliarde to the same #the seventh pavian #the eighte pavian # the nynthe pavian [the Passinge Mesures] #the galliarde to the same #the voluntarie lesson #will you walk the woods soe wylde #the maydens songe #a lesson of voluntarie #the seconde grownde #have wt you to walsingame #all in a garden greene #lthe:lo:willobies welcome home #the carmans whistle #hughe ashtons:grownde #A fancie — for my ladye nevell #sellingers rownde #munsers almaine #the tennthe pavian: mr:w:peter #the galliarde to the same #A fancie #A voluntarie With the exception of the two pieces dedicated to Lady Nevell, the compositions were evidently neither created specifically for the book, nor for the dedicatee, but are representative of some of Byrd's work of the ten to fifteen previous years. The tenth pavan is dedicated to William Petre, the son of the Catholic John, Lord Petre, while the sixth was for Kinborough Good, daughter of Dr James Good. The manuscript is notable for the lack of any liturgical works, and the pieces may reflect the musical tastes of Elizabeth Nevill herself. Dance music is represented mainly by the ten magnificent but somewhat sombre pavans and their galliards, and there are none of Byrd's more lively corantos and voltas found in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, and only one of the almans. The naive battell was supposedly written after the Armada victory of 1588, but more probably alludes to one of the Irish rebellions of the time. It is the first known programmed suite of descriptive music, and shows Byrd in a rare lighthearted vein. The variation forms, sometimes harmonic, sometimes contrapuntal, are on folk-song and dance tunes, and on the hexachord (ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la), possibly an invention of Byrd's. The masterful fantasias and voluntaries (the terms could in this period be used interchangeably), at least one of which is an arrangement of a fantasia for consort, are not likely to have been composed before the late 1580s, but in any case a full generation before the Italian keyboard masters published their toccatas. Recordings Complete recordings of the music in the booke have been made by harpsichordists Christopher Hogwood and Elizabeth Farr. Davitt Moroney's recording of the complete keyboard works of William Byrd of course includes all these pieces. Some pieces, including \\"Sellingers Rownde\\" and \\"Hughe Ashtons Grownde\\", have been recorded by Glenn Gould on piano.

It is bounded to the north and east by Fish Creek Provincial Park, to the south by Sun Valley Boulevard and to the west by Macleod Trail.  History  Midnapore was once an unincorporated hamlet under the jurisdiction of the Municipal District of Turner Valley No. 32. The Hamlet of Midnapore and adjoining lands were annexed by the City of Calgary on December 30, 1961. Following annexation, Midnapore was established as a neighbourhood in 1977. The Fish-Creek Lacombe C-Train station, which serves part of Calgary's current LRT light rail transit system, recalls Midnapore's former past through its modern interpretation of the former Midnapore rail station. Amenities Midnapore has a mall (the Midnapore Mall), a community centre (Mid-Sun Community Association) which it shares with the adjacent community of Sundance, as well as many fast food restaurants including McDonald's, Wendy's, Tim Hortons, Taco Time and Subway. The community also has its own man-made lake which is used by residents in summer for water sports and in winter for skating and tobogganing. Some houses in Midnapore border onto the lake and towards the northern part of the community, houses border onto Fish Creek Provincial Park.Access is restricted to homeowners residing in the community. It is not uncommon to see wildlife such as deer, foxes and coyotes wandering around this area of the community. White-tailed Jackrabbits, both red and gray squirrels and a variety of birds such as black-billed magpies, black-capped chickadees, merlin and house finches are found year-round in Midnapore. Midnapore also has a large business section with a Re/Max office, Tri-Services station (police, EMS and Fire), Wingate Inn, Beverly Centre elderly facility, a private elementary and junior high school, Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses, and offices for H & R Block, Genstar, and a medical clinic. Midnapore has two elementary schools: Mother Teresa (separate-Catholic) and Midnapore Elementary. Midnapore is also the home to St. Mary's University and Father Lacombe Nursing Home. Midnapore is served by a number of transit bus routes that feed to Somerset-Bridlewood, Shawnessy, and Fish Creek-Lacombe train stations. Demographics In the City of Calgary's 2012 municipal census, Midnapore had a population of living in dwellings, a -0.4% increase from its 2011 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2012.

A proportion of 14.3% of the buildings were condominiums or apartments, and 25.8% of the housing was used for renting. Education The community is served by Midnapore Elementary and Fish Creek Elementary public schools, as well as by Mother Teresa of Calcutta Elementary, Father James Whelihan Elementary and Junior High (Catholic), Midsun Junior High School (public) http://www.cbe.ab.ca/schools/find-a-school/Pages/default.aspx# and Trinity Christian School (Christian private). Lake Midnapore has a community lake; the 30-acre lake was dredged in the summer of 1976. A total of 1.5 million cubic yards of earth were moved, some 300,000 cubic yards of which were used to create a 55-foot hill on the adjoining park. The lake contains 165 million gallons of water, to a maximum depth of 31 feet. The park is used for swimming, boating and fishing in the summer and winter sports.

He was formerly an External Faculty Member of the Santa Fe Institute and is currently Centennial Professor at the London School of Economics. He is well-cited in the fields of economic sociology, social networks, science and technology studies, and social change and development. Biography He received a B.A. from Princeton in 1972 and a Ph.D. in sociology from Harvard in 1982. Stark was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2002. He is the former president of the Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics, and has been a visiting fellow at the Russell Sage Foundation in New York City, the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Palo Alto, the Institute for Advanced Study/Collegium Budapest, the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris, the Social Science Research Center Berlin (WZB), and the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna. Stark won the 2009 W. Richard Scott Award for Distinguished Scholarship from the American Sociological Association for his paper, “Social Times of Network Spaces” (with Balazs Vedres), which appeared in American Journal of Sociology (2006). In 2013 he received a Doctor Honoris Causa (Honorary Doctorate) from the École normale supérieure de Cachan. Work He has been a leading contributor in developing the concept of heterarchy, referring to the process of distributed intelligence and diversity of evaluative principles in organizations. He coined the term \\"recombinant property\\" to analyze asset ambiguity during the transformation of the economies of the former Soviet bloc. It has been adopted to study processes of innovation in high technology sectors of the United States and Western Europe. Stark has been a leading contributor to the new economic sociology. His research uses ethnographic fieldwork and social network analysis. In examining organizational forms as sites of multiple evaluative principles, or frames of worth, he has carried out field research in Hungarian factories before and after 1989, in new media startups in Manhattan before and after the dot.com crash of hi-tech firm stocks in 2000, and in a World Financial Center trading room before and after the attacks on September 11, 2001. Recent work with Balazs Vedres develops a combination of network and sequence analytic methods, a key development in the emerging field of social sequence analysis. His recent book, The Sense of Dissonance: Accounts of Worth in Economic Life, published in 2009, Stark draws on much of his recent research in post- socialist transformations in Hungary, his study of new media firms in Silicon Alley, and his work on decision making in trading rooms. Stark ties these examples together and suggests a number of key determinants of innovation within organization. Foremost of these determinants is a wealth of different goals and notions of worth motivating actors in an organization. With different conceptions of what is valuable, he argues, organizations can be equipped to succeed in a search in which what they are searching for is unclear (how Stark defines innovation).

Formally the body is a charitable company limited by guarantee, the Irish Cycling Federation. CI is a member of the UCI and the UEC, often called the European Cycling Union. CI is made up of cycling clubs, whose delegates have full voting rights, and whose members can also register individually. There are four provincial associations within CI, to which individual clubs also affiliate: Cycling Connacht, Cycling Leinster, Cycling Munster and Cycling Ulster. History The governance of cycling in Ireland has been profoundly affected by the country's turbulent history, particularly in the post-partition era. Early period, the ICA and the GAA In 1878, competitive and team cycling in Ireland was administered by the Irish Cycling Association (ICA). In 1884 the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) was formed to preserve native pastimes, and cycling began to feature at GAA meetings. The ICA was composed mainly of unionists and moderate nationalists from urban areas, whereas the GAA cyclists were mostly from rural areas and tended to hold strong nationalist views. Conflict arose between the two rival groups. Ireland was partitioned in 1921 and the Irish Free State was established in 1922. The National Athletic and Cycling Association of Ireland (NACA or NACAI) was formed to administer cycling and athletics, retaining strong links with the GAA. The new body suffered disputes between its central council representatives from Northern Ireland and those from the south. In 1937, administration of cycling was given to the National Cycling Association (NCA), an all-Ireland organisation \\"carved out\\" from within the NACA, and like the NACA and the GAA, with a 32-county purview. In 1947 the world governing sport of cycling, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), decreed that the NCA should confine its area of jurisdiction to the 26 counties of what was to shortly become (in April 1949) the Republic of Ireland. The NCA refused and as a result was expelled from the UCI. Within Northern Ireland, cyclists were divided largely according to their social and political affiliations. CRÉ and the ICF In 1949, several Irish cycling clubs broke away from the NCA and formed a cycling governing body that would restrict its area of jurisdiction to state of Ireland, as directed by the UCI, Cumann Rothaiochta na hÉireann (CRÉ). In the same year, a breakaway group in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Cycling Federation, successfully applied for official recognition to the UCI and also formed an association with the British Cycling Federation. In 1955, participation at international events had become a grievance of the nationalists. At the world amateur championships, an unofficial NCA team tried to line up alongside the official (CRÉ/NICF) Irish team, leading to fighting. CRÉ was replaced by the Irish Cycling Federation (ICF) in 1967. NACA remained in existence, and its cycling branch, the NCA, continued to organise cycling north and south of the border, as well as continuing its association with the GAA. Towards cooperation Since there were now two official national governing bodies north and south of the border, the two bodies co-operated to enter all-Ireland teams in international competitions. In 1972 the ICF sent a team to represent Ireland at the Munich Olympics. The NCA sent a squad selected from the entire 32 counties who ended up attacking some of the members of the ICF team during the road race. The Tripartite Committee In 1979 the Irish Cycling Tripartite Committee (ICTC) was set up between the ICF, NCA, and NICF as a forum within which differences between the associations could be worked out and joint racing ventures organised. The Northern Ireland Cycling Federation (NICF) continued to affiliate to the world body (now the International Amateur Cycling Federation or FIAC) as an independent entity and to pay its own fees. Regulations enacted in 1986 stated that only one fee will be accepted from each designated nation, and the NICF's fee was hence rejected, with Irish affiliation to the FIAC passing to the ICTC. This led to proposals for amalgamation of the three governing bodies. This proved acceptable to both the ICF and the NCA, but caused a split within the NICF. A vote to accept the merger was challenged in the High Court where it was overturned. FIC In 1987 the IFC, NCA and Irish Cycling Tripartite Committee formed the Federation of Irish Cyclists (FIC). NICF members who supported the change (nearly 75% of members, and 70% of the clubs) formed a new body, the Ulster Cycling Federation (UCF), which affiliated to the FIC, which was then admitted to the FIAC in September 1988 as the sole governing body for the island of Ireland. In Northern Ireland, cycling continued to be split between two groups. Funding from the Sports Council for Northern Ireland was channelled to the officially recognised UCF, whereas Unionist local councils chose to support the NICF, again illustrating how sport can become bound up in Northern Ireland's political conflict. =NICF= NICF members felt that, as British citizens, they were entitled to join the BCF. However, for several years the UCI blocked this, stating that the NICF riders should take licences from the FIC. In 1992, the UCI relented and permitted NICF members to race under BCF licences. However, the NICF was not permitted to take any fuller part in the BCF, and has to occupy a semi- detached status. The UCI unsuccessfully attempted to further reconcile the NICF and the FIC. In 1995 the annual meeting of the BCF granted the NICF the same status as regional governing bodies in Scotland and Wales, and in 2001 the BCF placed the Tour of the North, an Ulster-based race, on its Premier Calendar. This proved too much for the UCI, which resolved at its 2002 congress in Zolder to restrict the actions of the BCF and NICF in Northern Ireland, and to restate that the FIC was the sole body for cycling in the entire island. An agreement to implement the UCI ruling was reached in 2004 with British Cycling (the new name for the BCF) and Cycling Ireland (the new name for the ICF). In 2006 the NICF held a special general meeting to amalgamate with Cycling Ulster, starting in 2007, and operating as a promotional group. All NICF clubs would switch affiliation from British Cycling to Cycling Ireland. Cycling Ireland members would still be able to opt for their preferred nationality on the licence, preserving political and cultural identities. Cycling Ireland 2013 saw the 25th Anniversary of Cycling Ireland, and in recognition the Annual Awards Night was a celebration of cycling past and present, with Membership Awards being awarded in conjunction with the launch of the Cycling Ireland Hall of Fame. The Irish International Rider of the Year, as voted by the Sports Journalists, was also introduced. Regional bodies Cycling Ireland governs the sport on a provincial basis, with four sub bodies affiliating to the national body. These are Cycling Ulster, Cycling Leinster, Cycling Connacht, and Cycling Munster. Name Cycling Ireland is the trading and operating name of the body formally known as the Irish Cycling Federation. Influence Cycling Ireland administers road racing, track racing, off-road or MTB racing, time trialing, BMX, Cyclocross, and is involved in the promotion of leisure cycling events. Development programs Through the Coach Education Unit, Cycling Ireland run a range of cycling programs to encourage more people to participate in cycling as an activity, and to develop leading cyclists. Sprocket Rocket (launched in 2010) Sprocket Rocket was launched at the end of 2010 with the aim of teaching children better cycling skills, setting them up for a lifetime of enjoyment from their bike. Sprocket Rocket focuses on the four main skills involved in cycling; balance, braking, cornering and pedalling, and it works through three \\"progressions.\\" The focus of the Sprocket Rocket Programme is on fun, learning, and the individual. This means that kids from age 5-11 can improve and progress at their own pace, within a structured programme that is run in an enclosed and safe environment. Sprocket Rocket can be run in a variety of ways, from a three-session intense programme to an in-depth twelve- week course. This basic skills programme works particularly well in a school and club setting, but also has been delivered to a range of groups from Brownies to summer camps. As part of the promotion of Sprocket Rocket, and the promotion of cycling skills as a fun activity for kids, many big events host Sprocket Rocket Taster Sessions, whereby children get an introduction to the cycling skills by means of an obstacle course. Every June the National Sprocket Rocket Family Cycling Festival takes place during Bike Week, with cycling activities for all ages. The zones vary from basic and advanced Sprocket Rocket skills zones to MTB, Balance Bikes and Paracycling Zones, which are run in partnership with the Irish Wheelchair Association. With cycling being an activity that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of their ability, Sprocket Rocket is a programme that engages with specialist groups like Cerebral Palsy Ireland, Special Olympics Ireland and Dyspraxia Ireland, in an effort to make cycling more accessible. Bike for Life (launched in 2013) This is a beginner's cycling programme that caters for all cyclists, from the person who has just rediscovered their bike, to the more accomplished rider who wants to take on greater challenges. Delivered by qualified coaches, the 10-week programme brings the cyclist on a journey of learning, where they are educated on the various skills, aspects and components of cycling in a safe, welcoming and social environment. Bike for Life is sponsored by the HSE, the national health authority, under their Get Ireland Active initiative, as well as receiving funding from Women in Sport. One of the aims of Bike for Life is to close the gender gap in cycling through the creation of “Meet and Spin” groups of people of similar speeds and ability. Matt Cooper from Today FM and international cyclist Caroline Ryan are the two ambassadors for the programme. At the Launch of Bike for Life last month Matt Cooper said “Bike for Life should transform how people view cycling. It’s a new programme that connects people who want to improve their cycling, no matter what level they are at, and I am really happy to endorse it.” Gearing Up Off-Road (launched in 2011) This is a beginner's mountain bike programme that can be delivered in a variety of ways, whether it is a 10-week programme, or run over an intensive weekend. Throughout Gearing Up Off-Road the rider is brought through various steps, learning specific MTB skills from qualified coaches and Trail Cycle Leaders. This programme can be delivered in a range of settings, from secondary school environments to adventure centres. With the main focus of Gearing Up Off-Road being on the acquisition of skills, this can be delivered in any setting, from a mountain bike trail to a field, with props to replicate the off-road environment. Every session includes a ride out after the coaching session. Talent Team 2020 Youth Cycling has a strong tradition in Ireland, with riders being encouraged to participate in all disciplines to ensure they become more rounded riders. To assist in the development of skills, knowledge and competence in young riders, the Talent Team 2020 was born. The aim of this development training and racing programme is to nurture and develop young talent at this early age, in order to produce medal winning squads at the 2020 Olympic Games. FBD is the sponsor of the Male Talent Team 2020, which is managed by Martin O'Loughlin. Neenan Travel is the sponsor of the Female Talent Team 2020, which is managed by Orla Hendron. Two of professional cycling's top riders in the 1980s, Sean Kelly and Stephen Roche, have had a profound effect on Irish cycling. Cycling Ireland's headquarters is called Kelly Roche House in their honour. Previous ProgramsSean Kelly Cycling Academy (2005)= In 2005, Cycling Ireland opened the Sean Kelly Cycling Academy, a facility in Merchtem, Belgium as a base for Irish cyclists on the continent where they can gain experience of racing at a much higher standard than in they would in Ireland. It gives Irish riders access to UCI ranked events where they compete against elite professional riders. This facility was partly funded by the Irish Sports Council. Sean Kelly remained involved in the promotion of Irish cycling by working in the management of the new Irish continental team, the An Post–M Donnelly–Grant Thornton–Sean Kelly Team.

One of the Medici lions on Lejonbacken. View of Lejonbacken View from Lejonbacken facing north. Lejonbacken (Swedish: \\"Lion Slope\\") is a system of ramps leading up to the northern entrance of the Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden. They were built during the 1780s named after the pair of sculpted Medici lions prominently exposed on the stone railings of the ramps.  Setting  From the crest between the ramps is a panoramic view over the stately bridge Norrbro stretching across the Parliament island Helgeandsholmen over to square Gustav Adolfs torg, the latter flanked by the Royal Opera and the so-called Palace of the Hereditary Prince housing the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The bridge was originally intended to be extended some ten kilometres further north to the royal gardens at Haga and a royal palace there never built. The eastern ramp leads down to Strömbron and Skeppsbron, and the western to Mynttorget, while the quay Slottskajen passes beneath the entire composition along the canal Stallkanalen. Inside the north-eastern wing of the palace is the Gustav III's Museum of Antiquities. Opened in 1794 and thus one of the oldest museums in the world, it displays over 200 sculptures and antiquities collected by King Gustav III during a trip in Italy as they were originally exhibited. Underneath the ramps is the Tre Kronor Museum. When inaugurated in 1999, it replaced an older and much smaller museum. It exhibits the history and archaeological remains of the medieval castle originally built in the 13th century and preceding the present palace. Inside the five metres thick medieval walls and under the large bricked vaults are historical objects and modern models retelling the development of the palace from its Viking origin in the 10th century.  History  Ramps for the northern front were originally included in proposals for a rebuilding of the medieval palace Tre Kronor in the mid-17th century, and elevations from the 1690s also featured lions. Though the old palace was completely destroyed in the devastating fire on May 7, 1697, a new proposal for the northern front was quickly produced, presenting the ramps mostly in their present shape. The portions of the ramps next to the façade were quickly completed and the lions and their plinths were installed in 1704. The work on the lower lateral parts were however not begun until after Norrbro, the bridge extending north from the palace, was completed in 1807, and not finished until 1826-1834 when the last stage of the construction was realized to the plans of Per Axel Nyström (1793-1868). Models for the bronze lions were completed in 1700 by the French sculptor Bernard Foucquet the Younger (1640-after 1711). Foucquet used stone lions at the Villa Medici in Rome as prototypes for the commission, while the Crown had to melt sculptures taken from Kronborg Castle in Denmark to assemble the required amount of bronze. A wide range of rocks from various regional sources were used for the palace which is discernible in the northern front where hard to cut but more resilient rock is used for the bases and railings (e.g. so called Stockholmsgranit, younger granite found readily around the capital, grey or red in colour), and less compact rock, which is easier to carve but less resilient for more elaborated details – sandstone from Gotland for ornaments and mouldings, and marble from Kolmården for balustrades and bollards. The original plans of King Charles XIII to use granite for the northern front were finally completed by King Charles XIV John using rock from just north of the city and from the palace of Gustav III at Haga which was never completed. The two columns flanking the central entrance are six metres tall and cut from single blocks. They made a lasting impression on their arrival to the capital and were the pride of the architect when erected in 1695 (two years before the great fire). The quadrangular pedestals were however substituted for painted cast iron in the mid-19th century. In 2000, a public convenience from the mid-18th century, arguably the oldest of the city, was discovered under the ramps following an archaeological excavation. A precursor of the modern W.C. it used water from the canal passing in front of the palace to dispose of the waste matter. In 2006 the old façade lightning was replaced by a new, doubling the amount of light while considerably reducing the energy required and giving enhanced prominence to details and nuances.

Rethinking Revolutions Through Ancient Greece 2006:71; of the bronze ephebe found in the House of the Bronze Ephebe, and identified by Dorothy Kent Hill as having held a lamp (Hill, \\"Roman domestic garden sculpture\\", in Elisabeth B. MacDougall, et al., Ancient Roman Gardens 1981:89); Hill observes \\"today we can recognize many lamp-bearers of the same ephebe type\\", instancing the Apollo of Piombino first among others. The bronze is inlaid with copper for the boy's lips, eyebrows and nipples. The eyes, which are missing, were of another material, perhaps bone or ivory. It was found in 1832 at Piombino (Roman Populonia), in Etruria, in the harbor off the southwest point and was purchased for the Musée du Louvre in 1834. Its archaic style led scholars like Reinhard Lullies and Max HirmerLullies and Hirmer, Greek Sculpture, 1960. to date it in the 5th century BCE and place its facture in Magna Graecia, the Hellenic culture area of southern Italy; Kenneth Clark illustrated it in The Nude (1956),Clark, The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form, 1960, fig 23, p. 60; Clark expressed his reserves with the sculpture in his text, but attributed the \\"uneasiness\\" to its archaic stiffness. Karl Schefold included it in Meisterwerke Griechischer Kunst 1960Plate 235. and casts of it were to be found in university and museum study collections; one made by the Louvre has been returned to Piombino.According to Thomas Hoving, False Impressions: the hunt for big-time art fakes 1996:34; Hoving quotes his previously unpublished impressions of first viewing the Apollo in the early 1960s: \\"...a simpering Cupid.... the stomach is a muddy landscape of flesh...\\" Instead, B.S. Ridgeway (Ridgeway 1967) proved it to be— not simply an archaising sculpture of the 1st century BCE, of the kind designed to appeal to a Roman with refined tastes— but a consciously fabricated Roman forgery, with a false inlaid inscription of silver in archaic lettering on the left leg. The inscription dedicates this Apollo to Athena, an anomaly.Musée du Louvre: Apollo of Piombino . The two sculptors responsible could not resist secreting inside the sculpture a lead tag inscribed with their names, which was found when the sculpture was conserved in 1842. One was a Tyrian émigré to Rhodes. The Louvre's website adds that a comparable work uncovered in 1977 in Pompeii, in the villa of C. Julius Polybius, corroborates the hypothesis of an archaising pastiche, made for a Roman client in the 1st century BCE. The study of ancient Greek sculpture in the last decades has moved away from the traditional practice of identifying sculptures based on brief literary descriptions and attempting to recognize the characteristic manner of some famous names as reflected in reproductions of their work and variants based on their style, to concentrate instead on the socio-political world in which sculpture was created and other less subjective criteria.Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway characterized the new directions scholarship in this field was taking in \\"The Study of Ancient Sculpture\\" American Journal of Archaeology 86.2 (April 1982), pp. 155–157.

It is approximately east of the market town of Howden. It lies on the B1230 road to the south of the M62 motorway and on the banks of the Market Weighton Canal. According to the 2011 UK census, Newport parish had a population of 1,580, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 1,538. St Stephen's Church, Newport Newport has a church, a school, a few shops, three public houses and two playing fields. In 1823 Newport (then New Port with New Village, and the 'West Side' of the settlement), was partly in the parish of Eastrington, partly part of an extra-parochial area, and within the Wapentake and Liberty of Howdenshire, and the Wapentake of Harthill. In the early 1770s the area that became Newport was the uncultivated and barren Walling Fen. A clay bed deep, and adjacent to the present village, was found and dug to provide material for the production of bricks, tiles and earthenware. A quantity of 1,700,000 tiles and 2,000,000 bricks were being made annually by 1823. The village that had grown over 50 years attained a population of 339 and a Wesleyan chapel, established 1814, with Sunday School to educate 200 poor children for Newport and surrounding villages. Occupations in 1823 for Newport, New Village and West Side, included nine farmers, two blacksmiths, seven brick and tile manufacturers, an earthenware manufacturer, two butchers, two carpenters, two coal merchants, three corn millers, five drapers, one of whom was a druggist, three grocers, two saddlers, two shoemakers,five tailors, eight master mariners, a bricklayer, a hair dresser, a sacking weaver & basket maker, two shopkeepers, a baker, a gardener, a schoolmaster, and the landlords of The Turk's Head, The King's Arms Inn, and The Crown & Anchor public houses. A packet boat conveyed goods and passengers by water to Hull and back once a week. A carrier conveyed goods and passengers by land to Hull, and to Howden, once a week. A mail coach ran to Hull and Doncaster daily. The 1897–98 Newport parish church of St Stephen was designated a Grade II listed building in 1987. Newport was served by Wallingfen railway station, formerly Newport, on the Hull and Barnsley Railway between 1885 and 1955.

It is owned by Miami-Dade County and operated by the Miami-Dade Aviation Department. The airport is on the Tamiami Trail near the border between Dade and Collier counties in central South Florida. History Begun in 1968 as the Everglades Jetport (also known as Big Cypress Jetport), the airport was planned to be the largest airport in the world, covering 39 square miles with six runways, and connected to both central Miami and the Gulf of Mexico by an expressway and monorail line. The airport would have been five times the size of JFK Airport in New York.http://www.nps.gov/bicy/learn/historyculture/miami-jetport.htm At the time, the Boeing 2707 was under development and it was anticipated that supersonic aircraft would dominate long-haul air transportation. South Florida was viewed as an ideal location for an intercontinental SST hub due to the limitation that such aircraft would have to fly over water. Because of environmental concerns and the cancellation of the 2707 program, construction was halted in 1970 after the completion of just one 10,500' runway. Although the airport was left abandoned and unfinished, it was still retained by the local government as a general aviation airport and (to a greater extent) training airport. It was originally heavily used by Pan Am and Eastern Airlines as a training airport, as the long runway at Dade-Collier could accommodate aircraft as large as Boeing 747s, and was equipped with a relatively new instrument landing system, which allowed pilots to train using such a system which allowed aircraft to land practically blind. The isolation of the airport meant that it could be used for training flights 24/7 all days of the year without interfering with the traffic at Miami International. In more recent years, the advent of flight simulators has made such training flights less economical, and the airport is now used much less frequently, although it remains open to general aviation.  Facilities and aircraft  Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport covers an area of , which contains one asphalt paved runway (9/27) measuring 10,499 × 150 ft (3,200 × 46 m). For 2001, the airport had 14,468 general aviation aircraft operations, an average of 39 per day. As of 2015 the airport had an average of 12 landings and take-offs per day.  Other uses  High-speed automobile events have been held here because the runway is two miles long. This allows exotic cars to break the barrier, a pinnacle for street vehicles. Such events were held in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Oil exploration on the site was considered in 2009, but not pursued due to resistance from conservation groups. The Carlos Gimenez administration proposed holding a regular \\"Miami International Air Show\\" at Dade-Collier, similar in concept to the Paris Air Show. Homestead Air Reserve Base had previously been considered, but the idea had been rejected by the US military.

She developed from the Sumerian goddess Sherida, consort of Utu.  History  Sherida is one of the oldest Mesopotamian gods, attested in inscriptions from pre-Sargonic times, her name (as \\"Aya\\") was a popular personal name during the Ur III period (21st-20th century BCE), making her among the oldest Semitic deities known in the region. As the Sumerian pantheon formalized, Utu became the primary sun god, and Sherida was syncretized into a subordinate role as an aspect of the sun alongside other less powerful solar deities (c.f. Ninurta) and took on the role of Utu's consort. When the Semitic Akkadians moved into Mesopotamia, their pantheon became syncretized to the Sumerian. Inanna to Ishtar, Nanna to Sin, Utu to Shamash, etc. The minor Mesopotamian sun goddess Aya became syncretized into Sherida during this process. The goddess Aya in this aspect appears to have had wide currency among Semitic peoples, as she is mentioned in god-lists in Ugarit and shows up in personal names in the Bible (Gen 36:24, 2 Sam 3:7, 1 Chr 7:28).  In myth  Aya is Akkadian for \\"dawn\\", and by the Akkadian period she was firmly associated with the rising sun and with sexual love and youth. The Babylonians sometimes referred to her as kallatu (the bride), and as such she was known as the wife of Shamash. In fact, she was worshiped as part of a separate-but-attached cult in Shamash's e-babbar temples in Larsa and Sippar. By the Neo-Babylonian period at the latest (and possibly much earlier), Shamash and Aya were associated with a practice known as Hasadu, which is loosely translated as a \\"sacred marriage.\\" A room would be set aside with a bed, and on certain occasions the temple statues of Shamash and Aya would be brought together and laid on the bed to ceremonially renew their vows. This ceremony was also practiced by the cults of Marduk with Sarpanitum, Nabu with Tashmetum, and Anu with Antu.

Etymology The English name 'Jim Jim Falls' comes from the local Kundjeyhmi word andjimdjim, meaning 'water pandanus' (Pandanus aquaticus). Andjimdjim (or mandjimdjim in the neighbouring Kunwinjku language) lines the creek below Jim Jim Falls.

In the dry season, access from the Kakadu Highway is possible via a gravel road, with the final suitable for four-wheel drive vehicles only. However, during much of this period the falls dry up and do not flow. In the wet season when the falls are at their most spectacular, it is impossible to drive any vehicle into the area and are best viewed from the air together with the nearby Twin Falls. It is believed that 140 million years ago much of Kakadu was under a shallow sea. The prominent escarpment wall formed sea cliffs and the Arnhem Land plateau formed a flat land above the sea.

The BDR was re-established on 21 November 1948. In East Germany the cycling section of the Deutscher Sportausschuss, the DDR's sports body, was established in 1946. In 1957 it was renamed Deutscher Radsport-Verband der DDR (DRSV), \\"East German Cycling Federation\\", which was responsible for the sport until the merger of both countries on 7 December 1990. Since 2005, the president of the BDR has been former Federal Minister of Defence Rudolf Scharping. Between 2001 and 2004, former track-and-field athlete Sylvia Schenk led the BDR. Work The BDR issues racing licences, organises training for athletes and coaches, undertakes youth work, and oversees cycle races in Germany. It works regionally through a network of local associations. The BDR is also an advocacy organisation, lobbying for the interests of both sporting and leisure cyclists, although it does not aim to represent cyclists who use their bicycles on the road for transportation. Disciplines The BDR covers almost all disciplines of cycle sport: road racing, track racing, cyclo-cross, artistic cycling, cycle ball, cycle polo, BMX racing, BMX freestyle, bike trial and mountain bike racing. In addition to the sporting disciplines, leisure cycling is also covered, including cycle touring. Regional associations {  * Badischer Radsportverband e.V (Baden) * Bayerischer Radsportverband e.V.

Founded on May 23, 1994, the station is owned by 3ABN. History KZSW began as K53DU, a 100-watt low-power television station on channel 53, in Hemet. The station was founded by Ray Wilson of Buffalo Communications, and in 1995, it was sold to Victor and LaVerta Page. The station's power was then upgraded to 2.3 kW ERP, along with a call sign change to KHEM-LP. In 2000 the station applied for displacement relief from the FCC and was granted a channel change to channel 27, with a licensed power of 9.99 kW ERP. The station ran exclusively religious programming until April 2004, when it launched the \\"Neighborhood Newsroom,\\" a half-hour local news program that focused on the daily happenings in Hemet and San Jacinto. In 2005 the station moved its studios to Temecula and adopted a traditional commercial programming format with morning and evening local newscasts. In 2006, ownership of the station was transferred to KZSW Television, Inc. The next year, KZSW slashed positions and ditched live newscasts in favor of taped programs. It routinely faced difficulties getting on local cable systems, such as Time Warner Cable. In 2008, José Aquino, a Mexican-American businessman, signed contracts with the Page family, which owned KZSW Television; the Page family rejected Aquino's proposal to convert the station to a Spanish-language format. In February 2009, the station affiliated with NewsNet, LLC in a bid to provide local news, weather, and sports coverage pertinent to the Inland Empire and Southern California. In 2009, the Pages sold the operating assets of the station, but not its license, to Michael Sterby, and it is believed that Aquino provided the funds for Sterby to buy the station and used NewsNet to operate it. This set off a series of lawsuits, sparked by the fact that the license was not sold. A source to Milenio newspaper in Mexico reported that Aquino created a new company, also using the KZSW name, with the intent of confusing advertisers. The Pages responded by claiming that their license had been usurped. On March 22, 2011, Aquino attempted to place NewsNet in bankruptcy, a declaration thrown out six months later. At some point, the news and local programming stopped, and KZSW began carrying all religious programming from 3ABN. The station held a construction permit for digital facilities on VHF channel 10, licensed in Riverside, until 2015, when it built those facilities.

Wrestling headgear is protection that a person wears over the ears and chin during wrestling matches. Description The main purpose of headgear is to protect the ears of the wrestler, not really the head as the name implies. Thus, wrestling headgear equipment are also simply called ear guards or ear protectors. The headgear often covers the ears of the wearer, has two straps that go behind the head, two that go over the front and top part of the head, and one strap that goes under the chin (in some cases the strap will go on the chin). Headgear is often made of durable plastic, velcro, and button snaps. Reason Wrestling headgear is made to protect the wearer from long term injury. The constant bashing and beating on a wrestler's ears that comes from not wearing headgear can cause blood vessels in the ears to burst. These types of injuries do not cause any external bleeding; however incredibly painful sacs of blood will start to develop in the ears often resulting in permanent disfiguration of the ears. This condition is known as cauliflower ear. Treatment of cauliflower ear requires the wrestler see a doctor who will then drain the blood out of the ear via a needle. A wrestler may need to see a plastic surgeon to repair and/or treat a Cauliflower ear. Mandatory or optional use Headgear is required to be worn in high school and college wrestling in the United States. In Canada, and in international competition (freestyle and Greco-Roman), headgear is allowed but not required. In some cases, if a wrestler has face problems, like a history of broken noses or wrestles with stitches on the face, he or she may also have the option of wearing a face mask attached to the headgear. In the USA, a wrestler must have a note from a doctor saying the face mask is required. Since an opposing coach is able to ask for this documentation before each match, it is important for athletes to carry it with them regularly. In the past in the Senior Level, Olympics, and World Championships, a wrestler could protest and their opponent would have to remove their headgear. This is no longer the case and a wrestler is allowed to wear a headgear even if their opponent protests.

During a manoeuvre that was to shorten the Polish lines, the Polish 5th Infantry Division under Gen.

The laity assisted at the daily Liturgy of the Hours psalmody, the sacrifice of the Mass, the numerous processions, and were quite familiar with the liturgy. Those few religious practices outside of official services, e.g. the Rosary (a substitute for the 150 Psalms) originated in the liturgy.

Non-liturgical practices like the Stations of the Cross, the Forty Hours' Devotion, various litanies and rosary-based prayers and chaplets prevailed everywhere; novenas and series of Sundays and weekdays in honour of particular saints or mysteries were instituted. Entire months of the year were given over to special devotions, the most widespread being: January (Holy Name of Jesus); March (Saint Joseph); May (Virgin Mary); June (Sacred Heart); July (Precious Blood); September (Our Lady of Sorrows); October (Rosary); November (Souls in Purgatory).

Back, from left to right: Ginta, Suzu, Arimi. Front, from left to right: Meiko, Kei, Satoshi Miwa The following article is a list of fictional characters from the Japanese manga and anime Marmalade Boy. Protagonists=Miki Koishikawa is the main protagonist of the series. She's a lively high school student who is on the Toryo High School tennis team. She is cheerful, friendly, supportive, outspoken, a big girly girl and good-hearted. On the other hand, she can also be insecure, whiny, clingy, and very emotionally dependent on others. She had a part-time job working in an ice cream parlor, called Bobson's. Later, she works in a small decoration shop. When she was in junior high, she confessed her love to a male friend of hers named Ginta, but it was a disaster and Miki ended up heartbroken. Eventually she got over it and became friends with him again. While Miki was in high school, her parents went on a trip to Hawaii and decided to swap spouses with another couple. The other couple had a son the same age as Miki, and they all moved into a large house to live together. That boy was Yuu Matsuura, and Miki started to fall in love with him as they came to know each other better. However, Miki was very uncertain of herself and became jealous because Yuu was always surrounded by other girls, several of them being very beautiful and mature while Miki believes herself to be only average-looking and childish. She and Yuu eventually became a couple, but they didn't tell their parents because they believed their parents would disapprove. They confessed their love to each other in episode 25, and started dating in episode 26. Due to Yuu being away in New York, and Miki tired of worrying all the time, she broke up with him in episode 62. But the two got back together in episode 71 when he returned for summer break. A misunderstanding causes Yuu to believe that they are half-siblings, and he breaks up with her without telling her the real reason, thinking the truth would be more painful. But after some time trying to make the right decision, they decide to marry and ask for their parents' approval. There, they learn that they are not related and receive their parents' blessing. By the end of the anime, they marry; at the end of the manga, they make plans to marry after college. In the movie, she is played by Hinako Sakurai. Yuu Matsuura is the title character of the series. Miki gives him the \\"Marmalade Boy\\" moniker as he thinks that he is like marmalade - good looking, and sweet only on the surface, yet bitter. Compared to Miki, Yuu's character is almost a complete opposite to hers, as he tends to be more detached, less emotional, and less open about his feelings. He admits to admiring Miki's ability to show her emotions clearly, and it being one of the reasons he fell in love with her. Yuu is smart and naturally athletic, being able to excel in almost every sport although he did not join any clubs in order to focus on his studies. Yuu's dream is to become an architect and in the anime he leaves to attend St. Andrews high school near New York City to study it there. Yuu teases Miki a lot, but this is his way of showing affection for her. His first kiss with Miki is a complete surprise for her because she had only met him a few days prior at an introductory dinner attended by both their families. The Marmalade Boy Movie, which is a prequel to the TV series and set a few days before this dinner, reveals that Yuu fell in love with Miki before they actually met. It shows that he saw Miki when she was out and followed her, witnessing her interactions with the Gastman Team, all without her knowledge. One of Yuu's biggest goals, in addition to being an architect, is to uncover his paternity. A series of unfortunate events leads him to believe that Youji is not his biological father. Nobody knows of his quest at first, especially Miki, as he researches various individuals who may or may not have fathered him, acculumating with him believing that Jin is his father, and Miki to be his half-sister. However, it is revealed that Youji is his true father and is free to continue his and Miki's relationship. At the end of the anime, they marry; in the manga, they are making plans to marry after college. In the movie, he is played by Ryo Yoshizawa. Ginta Suou is Miki's best male friend and a member of the Toryo tennis team. Miki has had a crush on him since junior high and confessed her feelings to Ginta in a note. However, the note was found by Ginta's classmates, and Ginta downplayed it, without knowing at the time that she was watching, although he felt the same way about Miki. Although he did find out that Miki had witnessed his denial of any interest in her, he was unable to tell her how he really felt until high school. The romantic tension between them comes to a head with Yuu's appearance, which makes them realize that they still have feelings for each other. He decides to go along with Yuu's ex-girlfriend Arimi's proposal that they pose as a couple in order to drive a wedge between Miki and Yuu. In the process however, he starts to develop genuine feelings for Arimi, which she later reciprocates. Ginta Suou is voiced by Jun'ichi Kanemaru in Japanese and Yuri Lowenthal in English. In the movie, he is portrayed by Taiki Sato. Meiko Akizuki is Miki's best female friend. Meiko is the only child of wealthy parents and is very mature and beautiful. However, her family life is troubled because her parents are unfaithful to each other and constantly argue. She falls in love with Shinichi Namura after realizing that he has the maturity that she craves, but their relationship as teacher/student proves to be a huge hindrance. After finally gaining her parents' approval, they are able to marry In the movie, she is portrayed by Mio Yuki. Arimi Suzuki is a former classmate of Yuu's at his previous high school. She convinces Yuu to be her \\"boyfriend\\" for three months, during which they act as a couple on a trial basis. Arimi attempts to make Yuu to fall in love with her during this time, but fails. At the end of the three months, he still thought of her as a friend. Miki's indecisiveness about Ginta and Yuu frustrates her, as she does not think that Yuu deserves someone who cannot commit to one person. Arimi teams up with Ginta in an attempt to drive Yuu and Miki apart from each other. However, she eventually realizes that Yuu's behavior around Miki indicates that he does like her, so she stops her pursuit of him. Some time later, she develops feelings for Ginta and they become a couple. In the movie, she is portrayed by Nina Endo. Supporting characters=Tsutomu Rokutanda is Ginta's cousin and a classmate of Arimi's. He has had a crush on her for a very long time. Tsutomu sees himself as Ginta's rival, and Arimi teaming up with Ginta to split Yuu and Miki frustrates him even further. In the anime, after Arimi's definitive rejection Tsutomu befriends a girl named Yayoi and they start dating. Satoshi Miwa is the student body president and a third-year student. Many girls are interested in him, but he is only interested in Meiko, and tries to get her to like him in place of Namura. However, his crude sense of humor does not impress Meiko, who thinks he is an irresponsible playboy. They go out for a time, but Meiko is unable to overcome her feelings for Namura. Satoshi tries several times to make her forget Namura, but eventually he sees that he has no chance to win her over and stops his romantic pursuit of Meiko, staying friends with her instead. Satoshi is the first person to notice Yuu's interest in architecture. His initially unusual behavior towards Yuu arouses Yuu and Miki's suspicions that he is gay and has a crush on him, which he uses to his advantage. Satoshi and Yuu eventually come to an understanding however, and Satoshi helps Yuu uncover the truth of who his biological father may be, as he suspects that his father Yoshimitsu is a potential candidate. Although it is later revealed that Yoshimitsu is not Yuu's true father, Satoshi and Yuu stay best friends after this. In the movie, he is portrayed by Kisetsu Fujiwara. Suzu Sakuma is Satoshi's younger cousin who is a well-known teen model who loves beautiful things. After seeing Yuu's picture, she fell in love with his looks and requested that he be included in a cosmetics commercial that she was shooting. Afterwards, she asked Satoshi to arrange for Yuu to become her math tutor. Feeling that Miki is too plain for Yuu, then believing that Miki is cheating with Kei and that Meiko loves Yuu, Suzu tries to break up Yuu and Miki's relationship. When her efforts cause Miki and Yuu to fight, she feels bad and apologizes. She later meets and begins following Kei, after seeing him play the piano. She also admires him. In the anime adaptation, Suzu is shown to be in love with Yuu herself, rather than wanting to have him date Meiko. Kei Tsuchiya is Miki's coworker at Bobson's ice cream parlor who is a talented but troubled pianist. He also falls in love with Miki, and tries to use Miki's lost medallion to cause Yuu to think Miki doesn't want him anymore. This fails however, as Yuu sees through his lies and, though he fights with Miki, they make up. Miki yells at Kei for his immaturity, and forgives him. After some convincing by Miki to regain his confidence in music, Kei quits his job at Bobson's ice cream parlor and says goodbye to Miki, promising to return soon. He is later seen in the regular company of Suzu who started following him after seeing him play the piano. Later, Kei began to grow some feelings for Suzu. In the anime, a much more mature Kei reappears later, offering Miki his sincere and unconditional support after Yuu goes to study abroad. He says he does not need to have Miki forgetting Yuu completely, since he's happy to help her through her ordeal. Miki appreciates his company and even dates him briefly, but he cannot compete with Yuu. Shin'ichi Namura , affectionately known as \\"Na-chan\\" by his students, is a former Toryo student who returned to his alma mater as tennis coach and English teacher. He develops feelings for the student Meiko Akizuki, which are reciprocated. However, because she is a student they must keep their relationship secret. The relationship is eventually discovered, embroiling Namura in a big scandal. Finding his position at Toryo untenable and fearing he'll be a hindrance for Meiko, he resigns and returns to his hometown of Hiroshima in order to study real estate and take over the family business. Namura tries to push Meiko away from him no matter how much he loves her, thinking that he cannot allow her future to be tainted. Ultimately, Meiko proves him wrong, and they reach an agreement: as soon as Meiko graduates and turns 17 (the age at which she can marry Namura without her parents' approval), she will come with him to Hiroshima not only marry him, but also to study literature and become a writer. At the end of the series, the agreement is filled and they marry. In the movie, he is portrayed by Terunosuke Takezai. Jin Koishikawa Miki's father and an accountant who works at a bank. He married Miki's mother Rumi after breaking up with his old girlfriend Chiyako and helping Rumi over her own break up with her boyfriend Youji. They moved to England and had Miki there, then returned to Japan. Later, he and Rumi reencounter Chiyako and Youji, reach an agreement, and swap spouses. In the movie, he is played by Michitaka Tsutsui. Rumi Matsuura Miki's mother, infamous for her bad cooking. She is cheerful and sweet, and like her ex-husband, a little childlike as well. She works at a cosmetics company. She was married to her old friend Jin Koishikawa, later divorced him on good terms, and married Youji Matsuura, her old flame. In the movie, she is played by Rei Dan. Youji Matsuura Yuu's father, who works at a trading company. He is mature and quick-witted, like his ex-wife and now best friend Chiyako. He is also good at math, yet horrible at video games. Initially marrying Chiyato after she was dumped by Jin to help support her baby, they remained together after her miscarriage and had Yuu. After divorcing Chiyako, he married Rumi. In the movie, he is played by Shosuke Tanihara. Chiyako Koishikawa Yuu's mother, who is a very good cook. She works for a cosmetics company. She also gets along well with Miki, yet tries to not be pushy on her, which Miki appreciates a lot. She was close to her former boss, Yoshimitsu Miwa, but was perceived to be having an affair with him and her relationship with Jin was ruined. She was pregnant by Jin, but he dumped her before she could tell him and the strain of the situation proved to be too much and she suffered a miscarriage. This led Yuu to think that Youji is not his true father. In the movie, she is played by Miho Nakayama. Anime-only characters=Anju Kitahara Yuu's childhood friend, who first appeared in episode 36 of the anime. She is a very soft-spoken person and has been in love with Yuu since the sixth grade. Having met Miki and finding out that she is dating Yuu, she respects their relationship and does not want to come in between them. In fact, Anju confesses to Miki her feeling for Yuu and tells her that she wants to be second to Yuu. Anju has a very life-threatening heart condition. She collapses at Christmas and wakes up in the hospital bed. She tells Yuu that she will have the operation she needs and to go to Miki and that she has gotten over him. She then leaves for America in order to have an operation that will save her. She later appears in New York in episode 52, where Yuus notices that she and Bill make a good couple. Michael Grant An exchange student from New York, currently staying at Miki's house. He is in love with Miki ever since they first met, and intends to steal her from Yuu. He doesn't like Kei very much and feels uncomfortable around him because Kei wants to steal Miki from Yuu while Yuu was studying in New York, like himself. He doesn't bother Miki when she's upset or crying in her room, though he once climbed to her window like Yuu did. Brian Grant Michael's older brother who lives in New York and goes to the same school that Yuu goes to in the last season. He is quick-tempered. He is in love with Jinny, but she keeps pushing him away, which makes him very upset. He sees Yuu and Jinny kissing once, which he jealously calls Michael, telling him that Yuu is being unfaithful to Miki, which causes problems in Japan. However, when he challenges Yuu to a basketball game and loses, they both become best friends and is supportive of his relationship with Miki. After Jinny turn him down for Bill, he decides to date Doris after hearing her confession. Jinny Golding A girl who is Yuu's classmate when he goes to America. She is out-going and fun. She immediately falls for Yuu, when she first meets him. She is the object of affection to Brian, who keeps turning him down. Yuu tells her that he is in a relationship with Miki in episode 55. She, like Arimi, will stop at nothing to be with Yuu. However, unlike Arimi, she is more aggressive. She reaches the low point of evil, when in episode 61, she ruins Yuu's relationship with Miki. Bill, Yu's roommate finds this out a couple of episodes later and slaps her. Jinny later apologizes to Yuu, who gently tells her that it's his own fault for his breakup with Miki. She encourages Yuu to go back to Japan and make up with Miki. Surprisingly, she later dates Bill, who she initially thought he was gay. Bill Matheson He is Yuu's roommate in America and best friend to Brian. He and Yuu become instant friends. Although his behavior around Yuu has led some to believe he's gay. He is very supportive and kind to all his friends. He has a crush on Jinny, and lets her pretend to think that he is gay in order to get close to her. Eventually, he and Jinny hook up in episode 69 of the anime. Doris O'Connor She is Jinny's roommate and best friend. Unlike Jinny, she is more down-to-earth, intelligent and practical. She is a good confidant to all her friends. She likes Brian and confesses to him after Jinny and Bill get together. Brian accepts and they became a couple.

In 1867 he became professor of pharmacology and toxicology at the University of Giessen. Buchheim is remembered for his pioneer work in experimental pharmacology. He was instrumental in turning pharmacology from an empirical study of medicine into an exact science. He introduced the bioassay to pharmacology, and created a methodology for determining the quantitative and medical aspects of chemical substances. While a student in Leipzig, Buchheim translated Jonathan Pereira's (1804–1853) handbook of pharmacology from English into German. He also edited the book, eliminating obsolete and ineffectual medicines and practices, while adding updated information, including a chapter of his own called Art der Wirkung (\\"The Pharmacological Action\\").

This program can be used either to generate Error-Correcting Code (ECC) data from an existing media or to augment an ISO image with ECC data prior to being written onto a medium. dvdisaster is free software available under the GNU General Public License. Recovery modes When an optical disc is physically damaged (such as by scratching), or has begun to deteriorate, some parts of the data on the disc may become unreadable. By utilizing the ECC data previously generated by dvdisaster, damaged parts of the disc data can be recovered. The two modes of ECC data generation in dvdisaster make use of Reed–Solomon codes. In RS01 mode, the generated data is created from a disc image and is stored in a separate file, which must be written on some other medium. Alternatively, in RS02 mode, the ECC data is appended to the end of the disc image before the image is burned to disc. When a CD or DVD has been augmented in RS02 mode, the 'augmented' section of the data remains invisible to the normal user, and the disc remains fully compatible with computers without knowledge of or installation of dvdisaster. In this way a damaged disc may be fully recoverable by installing the software, accessing the Reed- Solomon error correcting code using dvdisaster and rebuilding the image (to hard disk). dvdisaster can be helpful to recover the contents of a damaged disc even when no ECC data is available. The entire disc can be read into an image, skipping damaged parts. dvdisaster can then repeatedly rescan just the missing parts until all damaged areas have been filled in by correct data. Difference with other Reed-Solomon implementations dvdisaster applies an image-based approach to data recovery. It does not apply a file-based data recovery, as reading a defective medium at the file level means trying to read as much data as possible from each file. But a limitation of the file-based approach arises when data sectors are damaged which have book-keeping functions in the file system. The list of files on the medium may be truncated. Or the mapping of data sectors to files is incomplete. Therefore, files or parts from files may be lost even though the respective data sectors would still be readable by the hardware. In contrast, reading at the image level uses direct communication with the drive hardware to access the data sectors. It is important to point out that each unit of ECC data dvdisaster places at the end is calculated from sectors of the original data spread around in the original image. Each group of original data sectors and the added ECC sector(s) forms a \\"cluster\\". Any part of the cluster can be recovered as long as the amount of damages in that cluster is smaller than the amount of added ECC data in that cluster, therefore the location on disk of the ECC data doesn't matter. Clusters are different in Parchive, since each file is considered as a single block: with dvdisaster data loss begins when one of the clusters has more than about 15% of errors (unlikely to happen but theoretically possible with few KiB of data), while Parchive can recover any error, provided that the PAR2 files are intact and that the number of corrupted files (it doesn't matter how much corrupted) is smaller than the number of available ECC files. dvdisaster also has a mode with separate ECC files.

It lies 9 kilometres east of Sighetu Marmației, across the Tisza River from Velykyy Bychkiv, Ukraine. Villages The commune is composed of four villages: Bocicoiu Mare, Crăciunești (Tiszakarácsonyfalva; Кричунів), Lunca la Tisa (Tiszalonka; Луг над Тисою) and Tisa (Tiszaveresmart; Миків). History Main road in Bocicoiu Mare The village was first mentioned in 1373, by the name Boshko. Its name derives from a Slavic word meaning \\"bull\\". From 1556 it belonged to the Báthory family. By 1711 a mansion already stood here. After the failed revolution led by Francis II Rákóczi, Germans settled down in the area. The village was known as Németbocskó (\\"German Bocskó\\", later called Újbocskó or \\"New Bocskó\\") and was united with two villages (Nagybocskó and Kisbocskó; \\"Greater\\" and \\"Smaller\\" Bocskó) across the river, forming a greater village called Nagybocskó. This village had thus three parts: Újbocskó, which forms today's Bocicoiu Mare, and Kisbocskó and Nagybocskó, which form today's Velykyy Bychkiv. Lunca la Tisa was part of the former Hungarian village of Lonka, which was cut into two parts after the World Wars, when the Tisza River became a natural border between Romania and Ukraine. Its Ukrainian half forms the village of Luh (Луг). Demographics In 1910 the village had 5955 inhabitants: 3078 Ruthenians, 1646 Hungarians and 1177 Germans. It belonged to the Hungarian county of Máramaros. After World War I the village was split in two, and the river became a natural border of the two countries, with Velykyy Bychkiv in Czechoslovakia. In 1940, both half became again part of Hungary, before the former split was reinstated after the end of World War II, however due to the new border arrangements Velykyy Bychkiv became part of Ukrainian SSR in 1945). At the 2011 census, 53.2% of inhabitants were Ukrainians, 39.6% Romanians and 6.8% Hungarians. At the 2002 census, 76.8% were Romanian Orthodox, 8.5% Roman Catholic, 8.2% Greek-Catholic and 4.7% stated they belonged to another religion. Main sights * Its Roman Catholic church was built in the 14th century in Gothic style architecture, but it was rebuilt several times and lost its Gothic elements.

Born and raised in Germany, he went to China shortly before World War II and ended up being an aircraft mechanic for the United States Army Air Forces there. He became an American citizen by an Act of Congress and went on to a career in the aerospace manufacturing industry. Childhood and education Neumann was born in Frankfurt (Oder) in the Prussian Province of Brandenburg. His parents Siegfried and Frieda were non-practicing \\"Jewish Germans\\". As a teenager, Neumann apprenticed under a master auto mechanic, surnamed Schroth, who followed the traditional Prussian lifestyle of \\"First the work, then the pleasure.\\" In 1935, Neumann entered the well-regarded technical college Ingenieurschule Mittweida and earned very high grades. With other students from the college, he learned to construct and pilot a one-person glider. His experience as an engine mechanic, an aircraft designer, and as a practical engineer proved very useful in his career. Off to China The winds of war were growing in Nazi Germany, and alliances were murky and shifting. In late 1938, Neumann saw a bulletin board posting at Mittweida saying that Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek needed engineers in his fight against Japanese invaders. Engineers who got the jobs would receive deferment from conscription into the German army. Neumann decided to leave his family and embark on a long journey to the British colony of Hong Kong in May 1939. But upon arriving in Hong Kong, he found that the company for which he was to work had disappeared. Fortunately, his skills as an auto mechanic were in great demand. A few months later, on 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. On 3 September, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany, and all Germans in Hong Kong were rounded up and interned in La Salle College, Kowloon, a Christian Brothers High School for boys. Neumann was interned in the school together with some 100 Germans for several months. The British in Hong Kong considered any German citizen a potential fifth column and revoked his passport. No embassy would talk to him. Luckily, Neumann had a chance meeting with W. Langhorne Bond of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC). The company arranged for Neumann to enter China without a passport. He flew to Kunming, capital of the remote Yunnan province, and there he contacted the Chinese Air Force. He worked as an auto mechanic until the Pearl Harbor attack, when he accepted an offer from Colonel Claire Lee Chennault, who had established the Chinese Air Force with Madame Chiang Kai-shek, to work in support of that Air Force. As the war with Japan progressed, the Chinese Air Force became the American Volunteer Group (AVG), nicknamed the \\"Flying Tigers.\\" Neumann was part of the Headquarters Squadron as a Propeller Specialist. While with the Flying Tigers, Neumann was nicknamed \\"Herman the German\\". When the AVG was replaced by the U.S. Army Air Forces, Neumann was inducted into the USAAF in July 1942 although he was not yet a U.S. citizen. He helped the effort against the Japanese in many important ways. He led dangerous supply convoys, performed all types of mechanical repairs on P-40 aircraft, translated to and from Chinese, assembled a working enemy Zero fighter from crash parts to assess its flight characteristics (the other such Zero was the Akutan Zero), and even directed bombing attacks from the ground while disguised as a Chinese coolie. Eventually Neumann was dispatched to Washington, D.C. to brief William Donovan, head of the OSS, where he met his future wife Clarice. Yet for all of Neumann's heroism in China, as a German he was still considered an enemy alien. It took an act of the United States Congress to correct this. After the war, he was finally permitted to work for Douglas Aircraft Research. Return to China In late 1946, Chennault offered Neumann an engineering position with Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Airline, a new airline Chennault was forming using war-surplus C-46 transports. Neumann accepted, and on their way to China he and Clarice were married. In the year that followed, the Chinese Civil War was raging and the Communist People's Liberation Army was taking over China. The Neumanns had no choice but to attempt to return to the United States. They chose an unusual route. Instead of flying or sailing across the Pacific, Clarice suggested that they drive over the Asian continent towards North Africa. Thus began their incredible and quite dangerous journey to the Mediterranean Sea, via Siam (now Thailand), Burma, India, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Palestine. Most border crossings were dangerous, because by 1948 most countries in Asia were undergoing political turmoil. Finally, after a journey of many thousands of miles on poor roads by Jeep, Gerhard, Clarice and their dog \\"Mr Chips\\" arrived in Tel Aviv during the first Arab-Israeli war and were able to travel conventionally to New York City. Jet engine innovator In March 1948, Neumann began work as a simple test engineer for the General Electric Aircraft Gas Turbine Division, located in Lynn, Massachusetts. There he drove many innovations in jet engine design, most famously the \\"variable stator\\" that fine-tunes air compression at the inlet. His J79 jet engine enabled aircraft such as the F-104 to reach air speeds of Mach 2; The development team (Neumann, Neil Burgess, and Clarence L. Johnson of Lockheed) were awarded the Collier Trophy for 1958. Yet even as a Vice President of General Electric, he piloted various jet fighters during the 1960s to personally understand the engines' performance. A major success for GE was his guiding the design and development of the huge high-bypass turbofan jet engines (or simply called \\"fanjets\\") that now power the largest commercial and military cargo aircraft. These include the TF39, CF6, and (in 50/50 collaboration with SNECMA) the CFM56. Retirement Neumann retired from GE on January 1, 1980, after 32 years of service. He remained active in retirement, until he developed leukemia and died on November 2, 1997. The Gerhard Neumann Museum in Niederalteich, Bavaria, honors his contributions to aviation.Gerhard Neumann Museum The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Aeronautics and Astronautic Department's Neumann Hangar facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is named in his honor.

While Dylan was out of the public's eye during an extended period of recovery in 1967, he and the members of the Hawks recorded more than 100 tracks together, incorporating original compositions, contemporary covers, and traditional material. Dylan's new style of writing moved away from the urban sensibility and extended narratives that had characterized his most recent albums, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, toward songs that were more intimate and which drew on many styles of traditional American music. While some of the basement songs are humorous, others dwell on nothingness, betrayal and a quest for salvation. In general, they possess a rootsy quality anticipating the Americana genre. For some critics, the songs on The Basement Tapes, which circulated widely in unofficial form, mounted a major stylistic challenge to rock music in the late sixties. When Columbia Records prepared the album for official release in 1975, eight songs recorded solely by the Band—in various locations between 1967 and 1975—were added to 16 songs taped by Dylan and the Band in 1967. Overdubs were added in 1975 to songs from both categories. The Basement Tapes was critically acclaimed upon release, reaching number seven on the Billboard 200 album chart. Subsequently, the format of the 1975 album has led critics to question the omission of some of Dylan's best-known 1967 compositions and the inclusion of material by the Band that was not recorded in Woodstock. Background and recording By July 1966, Bob Dylan was at the peak of both creative and commercial success. Highway 61 Revisited had reached number three on the US album chart in November 1965; the recently released double-LP Blonde on Blonde was widely acclaimed. From September 1965 to May 1966, Dylan embarked on an extensive tour across the US, Australia and Europe backed by the Hawks, a band that had formerly worked with rock and roll musician Ronnie Hawkins. The Hawks comprised four Canadian musicians—Rick Danko, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Robbie Robertson—and one American, Levon Helm. Dylan's audiences reacted with hostility to the sound of their folk icon backed by a rock band. Dismayed by the negative reception, Helm quit the Hawks in November 1965 and drifted around the South, at one point working on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. The tour culminated in a famously raucous concert in Manchester, England, in May 1966 when an audience member shouted \\"Judas!\\" at Dylan for allegedly betraying the cause of politically progressive folk music.For his detailed account of the Manchester concert, C. P. Lee interviewed members of the audience about the reasons for their hostility. One explained, \\"It was as if everything we held dear had been betrayed. He showed us what to think, I know that's a stupid thing to say but there he was marching with Martin Luther King, and suddenly he was singing this stuff about himself. We made him and he betrayed the cause\\" (). Returning exhausted from the hectic schedule of his world tour, Dylan discovered that his manager, Albert Grossman, had arranged a further 63 concerts across the US that year. Motorcycle crash On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his Triumph motorcycle near his home in Woodstock, New York, suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion. The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: \\"A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great irony is that 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter.\\" In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, \\"I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me away for a while, and I still didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after that. I realized that it was a real accident. I mean I thought that I was just gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before ... but I couldn't do it anymore.\\"Wenner, Jann. \\"Interview with Jann S. Wenner,\\" Rolling Stone, November 29, 1969, in Dylan was rethinking the direction of his life while recovering from a sense of having been exploited. Nine months after the crash, he told New York Daily News reporter Michael Iachetta, \\"Songs are in my head like they always are. And they're not going to get written down until some things are evened up. Not until some people come forth and make up for some of the things that have happened.\\" After discussing the crash with Dylan, biographer Robert Shelton concluded that he \\"was saying there must be another way of life for the pop star, in which he is in control, not they. He had to find ways of working to his own advantage with the recording industry. He had to come to terms with his one-time friend, longtime manager, part-time neighbor, and sometime landlord, Albert Grossman.\\" Early recordings Big Pink, West Saugerties, New York (2006) Rick Danko recalled that he, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson joined Robbie Robertson in West Saugerties, a few miles from Woodstock, in February 1967. The three of them moved into a house on Stoll Road nicknamed \\"Big Pink\\"; Robertson lived nearby with his future wife, Dominique. Danko and Manuel had been invited to Woodstock to collaborate with Dylan on a film he was editing, Eat the Document, a rarely seen account of Dylan's 1966 world tour. At some point between March and June 1967, Dylan and the four Hawks began a series of informal recording sessions, initially at the so-called Red Room of Dylan's house, Hi Lo Ha, in the Byrdcliffe area of Woodstock. In June, the recording sessions moved to the basement of Big Pink. Hudson set up a recording unit, using two stereo mixers and a tape recorder borrowed from Grossman, as well as a set of microphones on loan from folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary. Dylan would later tell Jann Wenner, \\"That's really the way to do a recording—in a peaceful, relaxed setting—in somebody's basement. With the windows open ... and a dog lying on the floor.\\"Wenner, Jann. \\"Interview with Jann S. Wenner,\\" Rolling Stone, November 29, 1969, in For the first couple of months, they were merely \\"killing time\\", according to Robertson, with many early sessions devoted to covers. \\"With the covers Bob was educating us a little\\", recalls Robertson. \\"The whole folkie thing was still very questionable to us—it wasn't the train we came in on. ... He'd come up with something like 'Royal Canal',Robertson is referring to \\"Banks of the Royal Canal (The Auld Triangle)\\" by Dominic Behan, one of the basement recordings that was bootlegged but never officially released until 2014's The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete. The song first appeared in Brendan Behan's play The Quare Fellow, and Dylan probably learned it from Liam Clancy, who recorded it in 1965 (). and you'd say, 'This is so beautiful! The expression!' ... He remembered too much, remembered too many songs too well. He'd come over to Big Pink, or wherever we were, and pull out some old song—and he'd prepped for this. He'd practiced this, and then come out here, to show us.\\" Songs recorded at the early sessions included material written or made popular by Johnny Cash, Ian & Sylvia, John Lee Hooker, Hank Williams and Eric Von Schmidt, as well as traditional songs and standards. Linking all the recordings, both new material and old, is the way in which Dylan re-engaged with traditional American music. Biographer Barney Hoskyns observed that both the seclusion of Woodstock and the discipline and sense of tradition in the Hawks' musicianship were just what Dylan needed after the \\"globe-trotting psychosis\\" of the 1965–66 tour. Continued recording at Big Pink was impossible because of the fanbase that had built up around Dylan. He even reported finding a couple in his bed once. New compositions Bassist Rick Danko co-wrote \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\" with Dylan Dylan began to write and record new material at the sessions. According to Hudson, \\"We were doing seven, eight, ten, sometimes fifteen songs a day. Some were old ballads and traditional songs ... but others Bob would make up as he went along. ... We'd play the melody, he'd sing a few words he'd written, and then make up some more, or else just mouth sounds or even syllables as he went along. It's a pretty good way to write songs.\\" Danko told Dylan biographer Howard Sounes, \\"Bob and Robbie, they would come by every day, five to seven days a week, for seven to eight months.\\" Hudson added, \\"It amazed me, Bob's writing ability. How he would come in, sit down at the typewriter, and write a song. And what was amazing was that almost every one of those songs was funny.\\" Dylan recorded around thirty new compositions with the Hawks, including some of the most celebrated songs of his career: \\"I Shall Be Released\\", \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\", \\"Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)\\", \\"Tears of Rage\\" and \\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\". Two of these featured his lyrics set to music by members of the Band: Danko wrote the music of \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\"; Manuel, who composed \\"Tears of Rage\\", described how Dylan \\"came down to the basement with a piece of typewritten paper ... and he just said, 'Have you got any music for this?' ... I had a couple of musical movements that fit ... so I just elaborated a bit, because I wasn't sure what the lyrics meant. I couldn't run upstairs and say, 'What's this mean, Bob: \\"Now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse\\"? One of the qualities of The Basement Tapes that sets it apart from contemporaneous works is its simple, down-to-earth sound. The songs were recorded in mid-1967, the \\"Summer of Love\\" that produced the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, their most technically elaborate album. In a 1978 interview, Dylan reflected on the period: \\"I didn't know how to record the way other people were recording, and I didn't want to. The Beatles had just released Sgt. Pepper which I didn't like at all. I thought that was a very indulgent album, though the songs on it were real good. I didn't think all that production was necessary.\\" Of the sound and atmosphere of the basement recordings, Barney Hoskyns wrote that \\"Big Pink itself determined the nature of this homemade brew.\\" \\"One of the things is that if you played loud in the basement, it was really annoying, because it was a cement-walled room\\", recalled Robertson. \\"So we played in a little huddle: if you couldn't hear the singing, you were playing too loud.\\" Mike Marqusee describes how the basement recordings represented a radical change of direction for Dylan, who turned his back on his reputation for importing avant-garde ideas into popular culture: \\"At the very moment when avant-gardism was sweeping through new cultural corridors, Dylan decided to dismount. The dandified, aggressively modern surface was replaced by a self-consciously unassuming and traditional garb. The giddiness embodied, celebrated, dissected in the songs of the mid-sixties had left him exhausted. He sought safety in a retreat to the countryside that was also a retreat in time, or more precisely, a search for timelessness.\\" Dylan had married Sara Lownds in November 1965. By the time the basement sessions started in Big Pink around June 1967, he had two children: Maria (Sara's daughter from her first marriage) and Jesse Dylan. Anna Dylan was born on July 11, 1967. Both Heylin and biographer Sid Griffin suggest that recording had to move from Dylan's home to Big Pink when it became clear that the sessions were getting in the way of family life. Domesticity was the context of The Basement Tapes, as Hudson said in The Last Waltz: \\"Chopping wood and hitting your thumb with a hammer, fixing the tape recorder or the screen door, wandering off into the woods with Hamlet [the dog Dylan shared with the Band] ... it was relaxed and low-key, which was something we hadn't enjoyed since we were children.\\" Several Basement Tapes songs, such as \\"Clothes Line Saga\\" and \\"Apple Suckling Tree\\", celebrate the domestic aspects of the rural lifestyle. The intense collaboration between Dylan and the Hawks that produced the basement recordings came to an end in October 1967 when Dylan relocated to Nashville to record a formal studio album, John Wesley Harding, with a different crew of accompanying musicians. The same month, drummer Levon Helm rejoined his former bandmates in Woodstock, after he received a phone call from Danko informing him that they were getting ready to record as a group.Griffin writes that Helm's arrival in October meant that he did not play on most of the Dylan–Band 1967 Woodstock recordings, including the sixteen Dylan Basement Tapes album tracks—and it is unclear whether the drums overdubbed on \\"Too Much of Nothing\\" in 1975 were played by Helm. Griffin believes Helm drummed on eight unreleased recordings made by Dylan and the Band in the house on Wittenberg Road that Danko and Helm shared after vacating Big Pink (). Heylin has suggested that Helm might be the drummer on four tracks on The Basement Tapes: \\"Odds and Ends\\", \\"Clothes Line Saga\\", \\"Apple Suckling Tree\\" and \\"Goin' To Acapulco\\" (). In his autobiography, Helm recalled how he listened to the recordings the Hawks had made with Dylan and remembered that he \\"could tell that hanging out with the boys had helped Bob to find a connection with things we were interested in: blues, rockabilly, R&B.; They had rubbed off on him a little.\\" Dwarf Music demos and Great White Wonder The bootleg Great White Wonder featured many of the songs recorded for The Basement Tapes—its release and popularity created demand for the official album Dylan referred to commercial pressures behind the basement recordings in a 1969 interview with Rolling Stone: \\"They weren't demos for myself, they were demos of the songs. I was being PUSHED again into coming up with some songs. You know how those things go.\\". Capitals as printed in original interview. In October 1967, a fourteen-song demo tape was copyrighted and the compositions were registered with Dwarf Music, a publishing company jointly owned by Dylan and Grossman. Acetates and tapes of the songs then circulated among interested recording artists.The songs on the demo were: \\"Million Dollar Bash\\", \\"Yea! Heavy and a Bottle of Bread\\", \\"Please Mrs. Henry\\", \\"Down in the Flood\\", \\"Lo and Behold\\", \\"Tiny Montgomery\\", \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\", \\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\", \\"I Shall Be Released\\", \\"Tears of Rage\\", \\"Too Much of Nothing\\", \\"The Mighty Quinn\\", \\"Open the Door, Homer\\" and \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\" (). Peter, Paul and Mary, managed by Grossman, had the first hit with a basement composition when their cover of \\"Too Much of Nothing\\" reached number 35 on the Billboard chart in late 1967. Ian & Sylvia, also managed by Grossman, recorded \\"Tears of Rage\\", \\"Quinn the Eskimo\\" and \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\". In January 1968, Manfred Mann reached number one on the UK pop chart with their recording of \\"The Mighty Quinn\\". In April, \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\", recorded by Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and the Trinity, hit number five on the UK chart. That same month, a version of \\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\" by The Byrds was issued as a single. Along with \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\", it appeared on their country- rock album Sweetheart of the Rodeo, released in August. The Hawks, officially renamed the Band,When Albert Grossman was shopping around for a recording contract for the Hawks in late 1967, the group instructed him to sign them under the name The Crackers—a derogatory term for poor white Southerners. The Band also mischievously dubbed themselves The Honkies. It was only when Helm joined them in Woodstock that they settled on calling themselves the Band (). recorded \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\", \\"I Shall Be Released\\" and \\"Tears of Rage\\" for their debut album, Music from Big Pink, released in July 1968. Fairport Convention covered \\"Million Dollar Bash\\" on their 1969 album Unhalfbricking. As tapes of Dylan's recordings circulated in the music industry, journalists became aware of their existence. In June 1968, Jann Wenner wrote a front-page Rolling Stone story headlined \\"Dylan's Basement Tape Should Be Released\\". Wenner listened to the fourteen-song demo and reported, \\"There is enough material—most all of it very good—to make an entirely new Bob Dylan album, a record with a distinct style of its own.\\" He concluded, \\"Even though Dylan used one of the finest rock and roll bands ever assembled on the Highway 61 album, here he works with his own band for the first time. Dylan brings that instinctual feel for rock and roll to his voice for the first time. If this were ever to be released it would be a classic.\\" Reporting such as this whetted the appetites of Dylan fans. In July 1969, the first rock bootleg appeared in California, entitled Great White Wonder. The double album consisted of seven songs from the Woodstock basement sessions, plus some early recordings Dylan had made in Minneapolis in December 1961 and one track recorded from The Johnny Cash Show. One of those responsible for the bootleg, identified only as Patrick, talked to Rolling Stone: \\"Dylan is a heavy talent and he's got all those songs nobody's ever heard. We thought we'd take it upon ourselves to make this music available.\\" The process of bootlegging Dylan's work would eventually see the illegal release of hundreds of live and studio recordings, and lead the Recording Industry Association of America to describe Dylan as the most bootlegged artist in the history of the music industry. Columbia Records compilation In January 1975, Dylan unexpectedly gave permission for the release of a selection of the basement recordings, perhaps because he and Grossman had resolved their legal dispute over the Dwarf Music copyrights on his songs. Clinton Heylin argues that Dylan was able to consent following the critical and commercial success of his album Blood on the Tracks, released that same month: \\"After Blood on the Tracks, The Basement Tapes no longer had the status of a final reminder of Dylan's lost genius\\". In 1975, as well, the Band purchased Shangri-La ranch in Malibu, California, which they transformed into their recording studio. Engineer Rob Fraboni was brought to Shangri-La to clean up the recordings still in the possession of Hudson, the original engineer. Fraboni had worked on Dylan's Planet Waves album, with backing by the Band, and the live Dylan–Band album Before the Flood, both released in 1974. Fraboni has described Robertson as the dominant voice in selecting the final tracks for The Basement Tapes and reported that Dylan was not in the studio very often. The stereo recordings made by Hudson were remixed to mono, while Robertson and other members of the Band overdubbed new keyboard, guitar, and drum parts onto some of the 1967 Woodstock recordings. According to Fraboni, four new songs by the Band were also recorded in preparation for the album's official release, one of which, a cover of Chuck Berry's \\"Going Back to Memphis\\", did not end up being included. There is disagreement about the recording date of the other three songs: \\"Bessie Smith\\", \\"Ain't No More Cane\\" and \\"Don't Ya Tell Henry\\". While Fraboni has recalled that the Band taped them in 1975, the liner notes for the reissued versions of the Band's own albums state that these songs were recorded between 1967 and 1970. Ultimately, eight of the twenty-four songs on The Basement Tapes did not feature Dylan, several of the studio outtakes postdating the sessions at Big Pink. In justifying their inclusion, Robertson explained that he, Hudson and Dylan did not have access to all the basement recordings: \\"We had access to some of the songs. Some of these things came under the heading of 'homemade' which meant a Basement Tape to us.\\" Robertson has suggested that the Basement Tapes are, for him, \\"a process, a homemade feel\\" and so could include recordings from a wide variety of sources. \\"The idea,\\" he said, \\"was to record some demos for other people. They were never intended to be a record, never meant to be presented. It was somewhat annoying that the songs were bootlegged. The album was finally released in the spirit of 'well, if this is going to be documented, let's at least make it good quality.'\\"Biograph insert liner notes for \\"Million Dollar Bash\\" (Columbia, 1985).

The cover photograph for the 1975 album was taken by designer and photographer Reid Miles in the basement of a Los Angeles YMCA. It poses Dylan and the Band alongside characters suggested by the songs: a woman in a Mrs. Henry T-shirt, an Eskimo, a circus strongman and a dwarf who has been identified as Angelo Rossitto. Robertson wears a blue Mao-style suit, and Manuel wears an RAF flight lieutenant uniform. Michael Gray has identified musicians David Blue and Neil Young in the photograph. The identification of Young has been disputed by Bill Scheele who has written that Young was not present. Bill Scheele and his brother John Scheele worked with the Band from 1969 until 1976 and were present in the cover photo. Some photos by John Scheele of the 1975 Hollywood YMCA photo shoot were included in the book accompanying the 2014 release The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete Reception and sales Columbia Records released The Basement Tapes on June 26, 1975. The album peaked at number seven on the Billboard chart, and reached number eight in the UK. It was acclaimed by critics. John Rockwell of The New York Times hailed it as \\"one of the greatest albums in the history of American popular music.\\" Rolling Stones Paul Nelson called its contents \\"the hardest, toughest, sweetest, saddest, funniest, wisest songs I know\\". The review in The Washington Post declared, \\"He may perplex, irritate, and disappoint, but Dylan has to rank as the single greatest artist modern American pop music has produced.\\" The Basement Tapes topped the Voices Pazz & Jop Critics Poll. Robert Christgau, the poll's creator and supervisor, said the recordings sounded richer and stranger in 1975 than when they were made and concluded, \\"We don't have to bow our heads in shame because this is the best album of 1975. It would have been the best album of 1967, too.\\" Criticism of 1975 album Criticism of the 1975 official release of The Basement Tapes has centered on two issues: the recordings by the Band on their own, and the selection of the Dylan songs. In his book about the basement sessions, Greil Marcus describes the album's contents as \\"sixteen basement recordings plus eight Band demos\\". Critic Michael Gray writes of the album, \\"The interspersed tracks by the Band alone merely disrupt the unity of Dylan material, much more of which should have been included. Key songs missing here include 'I Shall Be Released' and 'The Mighty Quinn'\\". Heylin similarly argues that compiler Robbie Robertson did Dylan fans \\"a major disservice\\" by omitting those two songs as well as \\"I'm Not There\\" and \\"Sign On The Cross\\". He writes, \\"The album as released hardly gave a real idea of what they had been doing in Woodstock. Not even the two traditional songs pulled to the master reels—'Young But Daily Growin' and 'The Banks Of The Royal Canal'—made the final twenty-four cuts.\\" Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker, on the other hand, said of the 1975 release that, in comparison to the complete recordings released in 2011, \\"Robertson, with some exceptions, knew which the good songs were\\" and was right to clean up the recordings. The authenticity of the 1975 album was questioned by a reviewer of the remastered version of the Band's Music from Big Pink, issued in 2000. Dave Hopkins noted that \\"Katie's Been Gone\\", which appears as a bonus track on the Big Pink reissue, is the same recording that appeared on The Basement Tapes, but now \\"in stereo and with improved sound quality beyond what the remastering process alone would provide\\". Hopkins declared, \\"The cat's out of the bag: 'Katie' and the other Band-only tracks on The Basement Tapes must have been intentionally muddied in the studio in 1975 so that they would fit better alongside the Dylan material recorded in the basement with a home reel-to-reel.\\" Heylin also takes exception to Robertson's passing off the Band's songs as originating from the basement sessions. By including eight Band recordings to Dylan's sixteen, he says, \\"Robertson sought to imply that the alliance between Dylan and the Band was far more equal than it was: 'Hey, we were writing all these songs, doing our own thing, oh and Bob would sometimes come around and we'd swap a few tunes.'\\" Heylin asserts that \\"though revealing in their own right, the Band tracks only pollute the official set and reduce its stature.\\" Barney Hoskyns describes \\"Heylin's objections [as] the academic ones of a touchy Dylanologist: The Basement Tapes still contained some of the greatest music either Dylan or the Band ever recorded.\\" Sid Griffin similarly defends the inclusion of the Band's songs: \\"'Ain't No More Cane' may be included under false pretenses, but it is stirring stuff. ... And while a Dylan fan might understandably grumble that he wanted to hear another Bob song, a fan equally versed and interested more generally in late 20th-century American music would only smile and thank the Good Lord for the gift of this song.\\" Of the Band's version of \\"Don't Ya Tell Henry\\", he writes, \\"True, the argument could be made that Robertson was way outside his brief in including this on the two-LP set, as this wasn't from Woodstock or '67, and has no Dylan on it. ... But it is a song from The Basement Tapes era and it swings like a randy sailor on shore leave in a bisexual bar. So give Robbie a break.\\" By 1975, Dylan showed scant interest in the discographical minutiae of the recordings. Interviewed on the radio by Mary Travers, he recalled, \\"We were all up there sorta drying out ... making music and watching time go by. So, in the meantime, we made this record. Actually, it wasn't a record, it was just songs which we'd come to this basement and recorded. Out in the woods...\\" Heylin has commented that Dylan seemed to \\"dismiss the work as unfinished therapy\\". Themes Although The Basement Tapes reached the public in an unorthodox manner, officially released eight years after the songs were recorded, critics have assigned them an important place in Dylan's development. Michael Gray writes, \\"The core Dylan songs from these sessions actually do form a clear link between ... two utterly different albums. They evince the same highly serious, precarious quest for a personal and universal salvation which marked out the John Wesley Harding collection—yet they are soaked in the same blocked confusion and turmoil as Blonde on Blonde. 'Tears of Rage', for example, is an exact halfway house between, say, 'One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)' and 'I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine'\\". Singer-songwriter David Gray commented that the great achievement of The Basement Tapes is that Dylan found a way out of the anguish and verbal complexity that had characterized his mid-sixties albums such as Blonde on Blonde: \\"It's the sound of Dylan letting his guard down. 'Clothes Line Saga' and all those ridiculous songs, he's obviously just making it all up, they were having such a great time. The sound of the Band is so antiquated like something out of the Gold Rush and Dylan fits in because he's this storyteller with an ancient heart. At the time everything he did was so scrutinized, yet somehow he liberated himself from all that and enjoyed making music again. You hear an unselfconscious quality on this record which you don't ever hear again.\\" \\"He mocks his own inertia and impotence\\", writes critic Mike Marqusee, \\"but with a much gentler touch than in Blonde on Blonde. In place of that album's strangled urgency, Dylan adopts a laconic humor, a deadpan tone that speaks of resignation and self-preservation in the face of absurdity and betrayal.\\" Robert Shelton has argued that The Basement Tapes revolves around two sets of themes. One group of songs is \\"tinctured with the search for salvation\\": \\"I Shall Be Released\\" (on the demo, but not on the album), \\"Too Much of Nothing\\", \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\", \\"This Wheel's On Fire\\", \\"Tears of Rage\\" and \\"Goin' To Acapulco\\". \\"'Nothing' and 'nowhere' perplex and nag\\" in these songs, he writes. \\"The 'nothing' echoes the artist's dilemma: death versus life, vacuum versus harvest, isolation versus people, silence versus sound, the void versus the life-impulse.\\" A second group, comprising \\"songs of joy, signaling some form of deliverance\\", includes most of the remaining songs in the collection. In his sleeve notes for the 1975 release of The Basement Tapes, Greil Marcus wrote, \\"What was taking place as Dylan and the Band fiddled with the tunes, was less a style than a spirit—a spirit that had to do with a delight in friendship and invention.\\" He compared the songs to fabled works of American music: \\"The Basement Tapes are a testing and a discovery of roots and memory ... they are no more likely to fade than Elvis Presley's 'Mystery Train' or Robert Johnson's 'Love In Vain.\\" In 1997, after listening to more than 100 basement recordings issued on various bootlegs, Marcus extended these insights into a book-length study, Invisible Republic (reissued in 2001 under the title The Old, Weird America). In it, he quotes Robertson's memory of the recording: \\"[Dylan] would pull these songs out of nowhere. We didn't know if he wrote them or if he remembered them. When he sang them, you couldn't tell.\\" Marcus calls the songs \\"palavers with a community of ghosts. ... These ghosts were not abstractions. As native sons and daughters they were a community. And they were once gathered in a single place: on the Anthology of American Folk Music\\". A collection of blues and country music recorded in the 1920s and 1930s, the Anthology—compiled by Harry Smith and originally released by Folkways Records in 1952—was a major influence on the folk music revival of the 1950s and the 1960s. Marcus suggests that Dylan's Basement Tapes shared with Smith's Anthology a sense of alchemy, \\"and in the alchemy is an undiscovered country\\". Legacy While removed from the public's gaze, Dylan and the Band made music very different from the recordings of other major artists. Andy Gill writes, \\"Musically, the songs were completely at odds with what was going on in the rest of the pop world, which during the long, hot summer of 1967 was celebrating the birth of the hippie movement with a gaudy explosion of 'psychedelic' music—mostly facile paeans to universal love draped in interminable guitar solos.\\" Patrick Humphries itemizes the ways in which Dylan's songs dissented from the dominant ethos of rock culture: \\"While the rock world vented its spleen on parents and leaders, Dylan was singing privately about parental fidelity. While George Harrison was testifying that life went on within and without you, Dylan was taking his potatoes down to be mashed. While Mick Jagger was 2,000 light years from home, Dylan was strapping himself to a tree with roots.\\" This aspect of the basement recordings became obvious when Dylan chose to record his next album, John Wesley Harding, in Nashville in late 1967. The songs on that record, according to Howard Sounes, revealed the influence of Dylan's daily reading of both the Bible and the Hank Williams songbook. And its sound came as a shock to other rock musicians. As producer Bob Johnston recalled, \\"Every artist in the world was in the studio trying to make the biggest-sounding record they possibly could. So what does [Dylan] do? He comes to Nashville and tells me he wants to record with a bass, drum and guitar.\\" Dylan summed up the gap: \\"At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these homespun ballads.\\" When the Band began work on their debut album, Music from Big Pink, in a New York studio in January 1968, they employed a recording technique similar to the one they had become familiar with during The Basement Tapes sessions. As Robertson described it, \\"We used the same kind of mike on everything. A bit of an anti-studio approach. And we realized what was comfortable to us was turning wherever we were into a studio. Like the Big Pink technique.\\" That technique influenced groups including the Beatles, writes Griffin, who calls their Twickenham Get Back sessions in early 1969 an effort to record \\"in the honest, live, no frills, no overdubs, down home way that the Hawks/Band did for The Basement Tapes\\". \\"Listening to The Basement Tapes now, it seems to be the beginning of what is called Americana or alt.country,\\" wrote Billy Bragg. \\"The thing about alt.country which makes it 'alt' is that it is not polished. It is not rehearsed or slick. Neither are The Basement Tapes. Remember that The Basement Tapes holds a certain cultural weight which is timeless—and the best Americana does that as well.\\" The songs' influence has been detected by critics in many subsequent acts. Stuart Bailie wrote, \\"If rock'n'roll is the sound of a party in session, The Basement Tapes were the morning after: bleary, and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency. Countless acts—Mercury Rev, Cowboy Junkies, Wilco, the Waterboys—have since tried to get back to that place.\\" For Elvis Costello, The Basement Tapes \\"sound like they were made in a cardboard box. I think [Dylan] was trying to write songs that sounded like he'd just found them under a stone. As if they sound like real folk songs—because if you go back into the folk tradition, you will find songs as dark and as deep as these.\\" In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine ranked The Basement Tapes number 291 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and 292 in a 2012 revised list. In a special issue devoted to Dylan's work, Q magazine awarded the record five stars, its highest rating, commenting that \\"Dylan's work is by turns haunting, hilarious and puzzling—and all of it taps into centuries of American song\\". Other released Basement Tape songs Between 1985 and 2013, Columbia issued five additional 1967 recordings by Dylan from Big Pink: take 2 of \\"Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)\\" on Biograph in 1985, \\"I Shall Be Released\\" and \\"Santa-Fe\\" on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991 in 1991, \\"I'm Not There (1956)\\" on the I'm Not There soundtrack in 2007, and \\"Minstrel Boy\\" on The Bootleg Series Vol. 10 – Another Self Portrait (1969–1971) in 2013. In the early 1970s, Dylan released new recordings of five compositions from The Basement Tape era: live performances of \\"Minstrel Boy\\" and \\"Quinn the Eskimo\\" from the Isle of Wight Festival on August 31, 1969, appeared on Self Portrait, and October 1971 recordings with Happy Traum of \\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\", \\"I Shall Be Released\\" and \\"Down in the Flood\\" appeared on Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II. In 2005, the Band compilation A Musical History was released, which includes the 1967 Woodstock Band recordings \\"Words and Numbers\\", \\"You Don't Come Through\\", \\"Caledonia Mission\\", \\"Ferdinand the Imposter\\" and \\"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\\". In 1968, the Band re-recorded \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\", \\"Tears of Rage\\", \\"I Shall Be Released\\" and \\"Caledonia Mission\\" in studios in New York and Los Angeles for Music From Big Pink. Versions of other Band Basement Tape compositions, recorded in various locations between 1967 and possibly 1975, appear on Across the Great Divide and A Musical History, and as bonus tracks on the 2000 reissues of Music From Big Pink and Cahoots. Live versions by the Band of various Basement Tapes songs have also been issued: \\"I Shall Be Released\\" on Before the Flood; \\"Caledonia Mission\\" and \\"This Wheel's On Fire\\" on Rock of Ages, with \\"I Shall Be Released\\", \\"Down in the Flood\\" and \\"Don't Ya Tell Henry\\" appearing on the album's 2001 reissue; \\"I Shall Be Released\\" on The Last Waltz and \\"This Wheel's On Fire\\" on the 2002 box set release of the album; \\"I Shall Be Released\\" and \\"Don't Ya Tell Henry\\" on Live at Watkins Glen; and \\"Ain't No Cane on the Brazos\\" recorded live at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969, on Across the Great Divide. On March 31, 2009, Legacy Records issued a remastered version of the original 1975 Basement Tapes double album, which critics praised for its improved sound quality. According to reviewer Scott Hreha, there was \\"something about the remastering that makes it feel more like an official album—the earlier CD version’s weak fidelity unfairly emphasized the 'basement' nature of the recordings, where it now possesses a clarity that belies its humble and informal origins.\\" In the early 1990s, a virtually complete collection of all of Dylan's 1967 recordings in Woodstock was released on a bootleg five-CD set, The Genuine Basement Tapes. The collection, which contains over 100 songs and alternate takes, was later remastered and issued as the four-CD bootleg A Tree With Roots. On November 4, 2014, Columbia/Legacy issued The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete, an official 6-CD box set containing 139 tracks which comprises nearly all of Dylan's basement recordings, including 30 never-bootlegged tracks. A companion 2-CD set containing highlights from the recordings, The Basement Tapes Raw, was also released.

These services experienced weak passenger demand in the airport's first years of operation, despite local subsidies and reduced landing fees intended to make them more competitive. The Iwami-Haneda route boarded a record number of passengers in 2013 after Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni opened for passenger flights, as this made it possible to create tour packages to Izumo-taisha, Itsukushima Shrine and other regional attractions using both airports as gateways.

It does not operate in Scotland, where the Queen's Nursing Institute Scotland performs a similar function. The QNI is also affiliated to the Queen's Institute of District Nursing in Ireland - http://www.qidn.ie/. History In 1859, Liverpool merchant and philanthropist William Rathbone employed a nurse named Mary Robinson to care for his wife at home during her final illness. After his wife's death, Rathbone decided to employ Robinson to nurse people in their own homes who could not afford medical care. The success of this early experiment encouraged him to campaign for more nurses to be employed in the community. Elizabeth Malleson who was concerned to find that there was little local service of nurses for pregnant women in the 1880s. Malleson arranged for a trained nurse and midwife to be available to serve the people of Gotherington. Malleson's scheme was not the first but she decided to form a national organisation and her appeal for help brought her into contact with Lady Lucy Hicks-Beech. She was the wife of Michael Hicks Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn and they gathered enough support to launch a Rural Nursing Association. This was despite the opposition of Florence Nightingale.(2004-09-23). Malleson [née Whitehead], Elizabeth (1828–1916), educationist and promoter of rural district nursing. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 15 Jan. 2018, see link These were the beginning of organised district nursing. By the end of the 19th century, with the approval of Queen Victoria, the movement became a national voluntary organisation responsible for setting standards and training nurses. In 1887 'the women of England' raised a Jubilee Fund of £70,000 to mark Victoria's Golden Jubilee. The Queen announced that the money should be used for nursing, and Queen Victoria's Jubilee Institute for Nurses was chartered in 1889. Elizabeth Malleson's nurses became the Rural Nursing Division in 1891 was Malleson was its secretary.

District nurses visit more than 2.6 million people a year (c.2011). At that time the number of trained district nurses had fallen to < 10,000 in England. The number of health care assistants - trained to do specific tasks - had more than doubled”Parliamentary Health Committee, Fifth Report: Commissioning: further issues”. April 5, 2011. https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmhealth/796/796vw36.htm As a result, The Queen's Nursing Institute launched the 'Right Nurse, Right Skills' campaign. Queen's Nurses Training a Queen's Nurse in 1944 The title of ‘Queen’s Nurse’ was first given to nurses who had trained at the QNI, but the institute no longer trains nurses. It does provide them with professional support and development. The QNI re-instated the title of Queen’s Nurse in 2007 after a gap of 40 years to safeguard and promote high standards in patient care.

In 2020, during the Covid19 pandemic, the QNI launched TalkToUs, a confidential listening service for community nurses to be able to speak to someone about work or personal challenges. The QNI also has a programme called Keep in Touch, that puts working and retired Queen's Nurses together for regular phone contact. Fund for Innovation Since 1990 The Queen’s Nursing Institute has supported hundreds of nurse-led projects through its Fund for Innovation. Dissemination of project results also helps nurses in other areas to learn from and implement new ideas. The projects—led by community nurses, midwives or health visitors—set up new services or improved ways of working. Grants of up to £5000 are available, in addition to a full year of professional development and support.

Zimbabwe first gained prominence on the world stage when shortly after independence from colonial Britain sent a road and track team to the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow. The team consisted of Michael McBeath, John Musa and David Gillow – (the latter’s daughter Shara Gillow now riding for FDJ Nouvelle-Aquitaine Futuroscope). Throughout the 1980s Graham Cockerton competed as a professional in South Africa riding in the well known Rapport Tour. In 1988 Zimbabwe again sent a squad consisting of Pierre Gouws and Gary Mandy to the 1988 Summer Olympics in South Korea with Zimbabwe’s first European Pro Timothy Jones (cyclist) competing for Zimbabwe at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Atlanta USA. Through the course of the 1990s Zimbabwe competed internationally at the 1991 Junior World Championships held in Colorado USA as well as the Tour du Faso and Giro del Capo in South Africa which Tim Jones won in 1998. In 2005 former World Champion Belgian Roger De Vlaeminck sent a scouting team to the country with a view to creating Zimbabwe’s first ever Cyclocross team, a team was selected which raced in the Under 23 World Cyclocross championships held in St Wendel Germany with this being covered by VTM (TV channel) in their popular cycling reality television show Allez Allez. 2006 saw Linda Davidson win bronze in the time trial at the African Road Championships held in Port Louis, Mauritius 2007 saw Zimbabwe further make history when they sent a 9 member squad to the African Mountain Bike Championships that were held in Windhoek Namibia . Zimbabwe fared well with Margie Gibson attaining Gold in the Veteran Ladies Cross Country and Trevor Volker Bronze in the Sub Vets Cross Country races. Antipas Kwari by finishing 8th in the Pro Elite Race ensured his qualification for the 2008 Olympic Games- a race in which he finished 48th in the men’s cross country.

Members of the 113th also assist local and federal law enforcement agencies in combating drug trafficking in the District of Columbia on a case by case basis. The 121st Fighter Squadron, assigned to the wing's 113th Operations Group, is a descendant organization of the 121st Observation Squadron, established on 10 July 1940. It is one of the National Guard observation squadrons formed before World War II Units The 113th Wing consists of the following major units: * 113th Operations Group ** 121st Fighter Squadron (F-16C/D Fighting Falcon) ** 201st Airlift Squadron (C-38A and C-40C) ** 213th Maintenance Squadron * 113th Maintenance Group * 113th Mission Support Group * 113th Medical Group History=Korean War activation 121st Fighter Squadron Republic F-84C Thunderjet 47-1499, about 1950 In the fall of 1950, the Air National Guard implemented the wing base organization (\\"Hobson Plan\\") used by the regular air force. The 113th Fighter Wing was formed as the headquarters for the 113th Fighter Group and its supporting units. With the surprise invasion of South Korea on 25 June 1950, and the regular military's lack of readiness, most of the Air National Guard was federalized and the 113th Wing was called to active duty on 1 February 1951. The wing was assigned to Air Defense Command (ADC) and was redesignated as the 113th Fighter-Interceptor Wing. Its 113th Fighter-Interceptor Group was composed of the District of Columbia Air National Guard 121st and Delaware Air National Guard 142d Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons, both equipped with Republic F-84C Thunderjets, along with the Pennsylvania Air National Guard North American F-51D Mustang equipped 148th Fighter Squadron From Spaatz Field, Reading. On 20 March ADC redesignated the 113th Fighter Wing as the 113th Fighter-Interceptor Wing. The wing was moved from Andrews AFB to join with the 142nd FIS at Newcastle Air Force Base, Delaware. Its mission was the air defense of Delaware Bay and the Delmarva Peninsula. In April 1951, with the 116th Fighter Squadron at Geiger AFB, Washington slated to switch to F-86As, the 113th FIG sent fifteen pilots to Geiger to obtain their F-84Cs for use by the 148th FIS. These aircraft were considered to be \\"so poor\\" that they were all flown to the 113th Maintenance Squadron, then at Dover AFB, Delaware for total refurbishment before they would be accepted by the 148th FIS. In September 1951 the 113th FIW converted to F-94B Starfires with partial all- weather capabilities. During the six months the newly constituted 113th FIW was operational with the F-84C, each squadron had lost one example in an operational accident. Its federalization period ending, the 113th FIW was released from active duty and returned to District of Columbia control, 1 November 1952. Cold War 121st FIS 4-ship F-86H formation, 1960. With its return to District of Columbia control, the 121st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was re-equipped with propeller-driven F-51H Mustangs and resumed its air defense mission of Washington, D.C. It was not until 1954, with the phaseout of the Mustang and the requirement by ADC that its interceptor squadrons be equipped with jet-powered aircraft that the squadron was upgraded to postwar- era F-86A Sabres that had been refurbished and reconditioned before being received. In August 1954, the 121st began standing daytime air defense alert at Andrews, placing two aircraft at the end of the runway with pilots in the cockpit from one hour before sunrise until one hour after sunset. This ADC alert lasted each and every day until the end of October 1958 DC Air National Guard at Andrews Air Force Base (1961) Despite the reconditioning, the F-86A Sabres were weary and required a considerable amount of maintenance to keep in the air. In 1955, the 113th sent them to storage at Davis-Monthan AFB and received F-86E Sabres from active-duty ADC units that were receiving F-89 Scorpion interceptors. In 1957, the F-86H was already being phased out of active service with the USAF, being replaced by the F-100 Super Sabre, and the 121st received F-86H Sabres in late 1957. North American F-100C 53-1727 about 1965 121st Tactical Fighter Squadron F-105D 58-1173 after an air refueling. In late 1958, the gaining command for the 113th was changed from ADC to Tactical Air Command (TAC) and the mission of the wing was changed to tactical air support, although the air defense of Washington remained as a secondary mission. The Sabres were phased out in 1960 with the receipt of relatively new F-100C Super Sabres from active duty units receiving the F-100D model. The Super Sabre was a major improvement over the F-86H and it gave the wing a major increase in capability as well as it entering the supersonic age. In January 1968, a new crisis, the seizure of the American ship USS Pueblo by North Korean forces, and again the 113th was called to active duty. The wing was activated to federal service, and its personnel were assigned to Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina as a filler unit while the base's permanent unit, the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing was deployed to Kunsan Air Base, South Korea. At Myrtle Beach AFB, the federalized NJ ANG 119th Tactical Fighter Squadron joined the 121st TFS on active duty. However, not all wing personnel were sent to Myrtle Beach, as personnel were spread throughout the United States, Taiwan, Korea, and South Vietnam. The 113 TFW returned to Andrews AFB in June 1969, and transitioned into the F-105D Thunderchief (AKA \\"Thud\\") in 1971, receiving Vietnam War veteran aircraft that were being withdrawn from combat. The 113th was one of four Air National Guard units to receive the F-105, which was a very large and complex aircraft. The 113th was fortunate to have many Vietnam Veteran airmen in its ranks by 1970, many of whom had F-105 experience. The Thud was the first USAF supersonic tactical fighter-bomber that was developed from scratch. All others before it were adaptations of aircraft that had originally been developed as pure fighters. In December 1974, the 113th Tactical Fighter Group was inactivated, with the 121st TFS being assigned directly to the 113th Tactical Fighter Wing. In 1981 at the end of its service life, the F-105s were retired, with the 113th TFW receiving F-4D Phantom IIs, again receiving Vietnam War veteran aircraft from active- duty units receiving F-15A and F-16A/B next-generation fighter aircraft. With the F-4, the 113th returned to the air defense mission, becoming part of Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC), a named unit at the Numbered Air Force echelon of TAC. ADTAC had taken over the mission of Aerospace Defense Command in 1979 when the command was inactivated; the D.C. Air National Guard using the Phantoms for Washington, D.C. air defense. F-4D 66-7607 from the 121st Tactical Fighter Squadron, 1987 The 113th operated the Phantoms throughout the 1980s, retiring the Phantoms at the end of their service life in 1989. In turn, the 121st FS started receiving F-16A/B Fighting Falcons in September 1989. These were block 5 and 10 models coming from various regular USAF units converting to more modern F-16C/D models. The Wing retained its air defense and attack mission, however the early block 5 and 10 models really designed to do. In the air defense role these models lacked any BVR capability, limiting them only to close range combat with their gun and Sidewinder missiles. In the attack role these aircraft were able to deploy bombs, but with their smaller stabs the center of gravity of these aircraft was far from ideal making it quite a challenge for the pilots to fly these missions. The 113th Tactical Fighter Wing was not mobilized during the 1991 Gulf Crisis, remaining in the United States with its air defense mission. D. C. Air National Guard volunteers, however were deployed to CENTAF during the crisis and subsequent combat operations as part of Operation Desert Storm. Air Combat Command After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990 and Operation Desert Storm, Air Force planners reorganized the major command structure and the organization of its units to reflect the new reality of the 1990s and also a smaller force after the end of the Cold War. Tactical Air Command was replaced by Air Combat Command (ACC) as the gaining command for the 113th effective 1 June 1992. On 15 March 1992, the 113th adopted the new Air Force Objective Organization, which re-designated the wing as the 113th Fighter Wing. The 113th Tactical Fighter Group was reactivated as the 113th Operations Group, and the 121st Fighter Squadron was transferred to the 113th OG. Other support groups under the Objective Wing organization are the 179th Maintenance Group, 179th Mission Support Group and the 179th Medical Group. 121st Fighter Squadron F-16s over Washington DC On 20 June 1992, Detachment 1 HQ, District of Columbia Air National Guard was re-designated as the 201st Airlift Squadron, District of Columbia Air National Guard. The 201st Airlift Squadron provides short notice worldwide transportation for the Executive Branch, Congressional Members, Department of Defense officials and high-ranking U.S. and foreign dignitaries in support of the 89th Airlift Wing. The continuing efforts to upgrade and expand the squadron’s worldwide capabilities led to the acquisition of two C-38As in 1998 and two C-40Bs (Boeing 737) in 2002. In 1994 the 121st traded its early F-16A/B aircraft for Block 30 F-16C/D Fighting Falcon which upgraded its capabilities considerably. In May 1996, the 121st Fighter Squadron deployed personnel and aircraft to Al Jaber Air Base, Kuwait to support Operation Southern Watch (OSW). The 121st FS was the first Air National Guard unit to fly OSW. Operation Southern Watch was an operation which was responsible for enforcing the United Nations mandated no-fly zone below the 32nd parallel north in Iraq. This mission was initiated mainly to cover for attacks of Iraqi forces on the Iraqi Shi’ite Muslims. In July 1996, the squadron returned to Andrews AFB. C-38A Courier (s/n 94-1569) of the 201st Airlift Squadron in flight. In mid-1996, the Air Force, in response to budget cuts, and changing world situations, began experimenting with Air Expeditionary organizations. The Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept was developed that would mix Active-Duty, Reserve and Air National Guard elements into a combined force. Instead of entire permanent units deploying as \\"Provisional\\" as in the 1991 Gulf War, Expeditionary units are composed of \\"aviation packages\\" from several wings, including active-duty Air Force, the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard, would be married together to carry out the assigned deployment rotation. In February 1997 the 121st Expeditionary Fighter Squadron (121st EFS) was first formed from 113th personnel and aircraft and deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey in support of Operation Northern Watch (ONW). Operation Northern Watch was a US European Command Combined Task Force (CTF) who was responsible for enforcing the United Nations mandated no-fly zone above the 36th parallel north in Iraq. This mission was a successor to Operation Provide Comfort which also entailed support for the Iraqi Kurds. The 121st EFS returned to Andrews in April 1997. The 121st EFS was again formed in January 1998 when the Wing was tasked with a second Operation Northern Watch deployment to Incirlik Air Base. This time the deployment was only for a month with less than 100 personnel being deployed. Post 9/11 121st Expeditionary Fighter Squadron F-16C Fighting Falcon 86-0209 lifts off the runway at Balad AB, Iraq On 11 September 2001, the wing was given authorization for its pilots to shoot down threatening aircraft over Washington DC. After the events of 11 September 2001 the squadron took on an Air Sovereignty Alert Detachment role, stationing a number of aircraft at air force bases around the country to fly alert missions as part of Operation Noble Eagle (ONE). During one of those missions, on 11 May 2005 the squadron scrambled to intercept an aircraft that wandered into the no-fly zone around the White House. Customs officials had also scrambled a Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and a UC-35B Cessna Citation jet at 11:47 a.m. to intercept the plane. The Customs aircraft gave way when the F-16s arrived flew on the wing tips of the little plane. They dipped their wings – a pilot's signal to 'follow me' – and tried to raise the pilot on the radio. But the Cessna didn't change course and it was flying too slow for the F-16s. The frustrated pilots had to take turns dropping flares, breaking away and returning to drop more flares. One senior Bush administration counter-terrorism official said it was 'a real finger-biting period' because they came very close to ordering a shot against a general aircraft. Finally, when the Cessna came within three miles of the White House – just a few minutes flying time – it altered course.https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2006/january/pilot/flight- of-mistakes F-16C block 30 #87-0310 from the 121st FS is ushered out onto the runway before heading out for its deployment to Afghanistan on 11 October 2011 In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, the DoD recommended that Cannon Air Force Base be closed. As a result, it would distribute the 27th Fighter Wing’s F-16 Fighting Falcons to the 113th Wing (nine aircraft) and several other installations. The committee said that this move would sustain the active/Air National Guard/Air Force Reserve force mix by replacing aircraft that retire in the 2025 Force Structure Plan. However, the base was temporarily removed from closure 26 August 2005, pending review of new mission assignment. On 6 May 2008, the squadron flew its 2000th scramble since the events of 11 September 2001. Most scrambles do not lead to such stories as noted above. The 121st Expeditionary Fighter Squadron has been formed and deployed numerous times as part of the Global War on Terrorism. Supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), the 121st EFS deployed to Balad Air Base, Iraq, in 2003, 2007 and 2010. A deployment to Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) was made between October 2011 and January 2012.

He sang in Europe and America during the latter decades of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th century. Singing career and recordings Born on Mali Lošinj (present-day Croatia), Josip Kašman was said to be the youngest of 14 children born to an Austrian father and a local mother, Eugenia Ivancich. Possessed of a fine natural voice and a facility with languages, he abandoned a planned career in the law, to study singing instead with Ivan Zajc in Zagreb. His first public performance occurred in Zagreb during 1869. He was then cast in the lead role in a production of the first full scale Croatian opera, Mislav, on October 2, 1870. Six years later he made his Italian operatic debut at Turin (in Gaetano Donizetti's La favorita). Engagements in Venice, Rome, Bologna and Trieste followed. Before long, he had established himself as one of the best baritones in Italy, making an impressive debut at La Scala, Milan, in 1878 in Don Carlo. It was during this phase of his career that he seems to have altered his name from Joseph Kaschmann to Giuseppe Kaschmann for theatrical purposes. Bust of Josip Kašman He reached the peak of his success as a singer in the 1880s and 1890s, building an international reputation (as Giuseppe Kaschmann) and performing at such important venues as the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in Germany (in 1892 and 1894) and the Metropolitan Opera in New York City (in 1883 and 1896), as well as continuing to appear at La Scala. Audiences in Spain, Portugal, Russia, Monaco, Egypt, Brazil and Argentina also had an opportunity to hear him perform during his prime but he never sang in England. In 1907, he was granted permission to go back to Zagreb by the Austrian government, which in those days controlled Croatia. For many years he had been prevented from returning to Croatia because, as a young man, he had allegedly deserted from the Austrian army following the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This ban was lifted only after papal intervention on his behalf. He was particularly renowned for his performances in operas by Giuseppe Verdi and Richard Wagner. Towards the end of his stage career however, as the quality of his voice began to deteriorate due to age, he switched to the buffo repertoire of Rossini, Donizetti and other composers of comic operas. In 1903, he made a number of recordings in Milan for the British Gramophone & Typewriter Company. Last years and death As late as the 1920s, he was still singing roles in comic operas such as Don Pasquale and Il barbiere di Siviglia. His last public performance was in 1921, in Domenico Cimarosa's opera Le astuzie femminili, staged in Rome. Kašman also taught singing. His finest student was Salvatore Baccaloni, a celebrated Italian buffo bass. Rome became his final home and he died there in 1925, aged 74.

In carefully selected patients, when performed by an experienced interventional cardiologist, the procedure is successful in relieving symptoms in over 90% of patients. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a condition of the cardiac muscle which grows abnormally thick in the absence of a pathophysiologic cause such as hypertension (high blood pressure) or aortic valve disease. In a large subset of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, thickening of the heart muscle in a particular part of the interventricular septum causes obstruction to blood being ejected from the left ventricle. Alcohol septal ablation is a cardiac catheterization technique designed to reduce the obstruction to blood being ejected from the heart. The technique creates a small controlled myocardial infarction, killing the area of heart muscle responsible for the obstruction, and eventually causing it to fibrose and become less thick.  History  Alcohol septal ablation was first performed in 1994 by Ulrich Sigwart at the Royal Brompton Hospital in the United Kingdom. Since that time, it has gained favor among physicians and patients due to its minimally invasive nature, thereby avoiding general anesthesia, lengthy inpatient recuperation and other complications associated with open-heart surgery (e.g. septal myectomy).  Technique  Alcohol septal ablation is performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, and should only be performed by interventional cardiologists with specific training in the procedure. (Current guidelines suggest at least 20 successful procedures to demonstrate competence.) As such, it is only available in a few institutions. The technique is similar to coronary angioplasty, and utilizes similar equipment. Using wires and balloons to localize the septal artery feeding the diseased muscle under both fluoroscopic (X-ray) and echocardiographic (ultrasound) guidance, a small amount of pure alcohol is infused into the artery to produce a small heart attack. Patients typically experience mild chest discomfort during the procedure, which takes approximately 60–90 minutes to complete. Analgesics and mild sedatives are administered as needed. Patients typically are maintained in the hospital for three to four days to monitor for any complications, including the need for a permanent pacemaker in 5–10%. Complications are reduced in high volume centers, defined as a center that has performed more than 50 procedures, or an operator who has performed more than 20.  Outcomes  Relief of obstruction is noted immediately in the majority of appropriately selected patients. Clinical success is defined as a 50% or more reduction in peak gradient across the outflow tract, predicting continued improvement in gradient and cardiac remodeling over the ensuing 1 to 2 years. Over 90% of patients experience a successful procedure, with improvement in outflow tract gradient and mitral regurgitation. Patients typically report progressive reduction in symptoms, including improved shortness of breath, lightheadedness and chest pain. Serial echocardiograms are routinely obtained to follow the cardiac remodeling over time, and document reduction in outflow tract gradient. When compared to surgical myectomy, similar outcomes are noted out to approximately 10 years. However, a prospective, randomized trial has not been performed. Despite initial concerns regarding long-term arrhythmic potential after alcohol septal ablation, the risk appears to be no worse than for surgical myectomy. It is important to note that patients who fail to respond to alcohol septal ablation may still be candidates for surgical myectomy, and vice versa. Which patients are best served by surgical myectomy, alcohol septal ablation, or medical therapy is an important topic and one which is intensely debated in medical scientific circles.

He was also President of the Electoral College in 1888. Berret was born in what was then Baltimore County, Maryland on February 12, 1815. He had only two years of formal education before his father pulled him out to help on the farm. When his father died in 1831, Berret took over the farm full-time. In 1836, at the age of 21, he was elected to the Maryland state legislature to represent the newly formed Carroll County. He served two one-year terms from 1837 to 1839. Upon leaving the legislature he was appointed to an office in the U.S. Treasury by President Martin Van Buren and moved to Washington, DC. He served in the Treasury until 1850, at which time he started his own business prosecuting claims before the US government. That work continued until 1853 when President Franklin Pierce appointed him Postmaster of the District of Columbia. He served on the inaugural committee for Presidents James Buchanan and Abraham Lincoln. In 1858, Berret was nominated as the mayoral candidate for the Anti- Know-Nothing Party, a coalition of political parties that formed in 1854 as an opposition to the Know-Nothings' electoral successes in the city. He was a staunch believer in the rights of naturalized citizens to vote. However, by 1858, the Know-Nothings were a spent force, and the U.S. political landscape was such that the Republicans, who had once been a part of the Anti-Know- Nothing coalition, now stood independently from it as an opposition to President Buchanan and the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford. Thus Berret was pitted against Richard Wallach, the U.S. Marshal for the District; both men were of equal popularity, means, and political reputation, but on election day Berret won by 680 votes in an election that was marked by rioting, requiring the Marines to deploy, and the deaths of four citizens. The election sparked a fierce rivalry between Wallach and Berret, enough so that when Berret defeated Wallach again in the 1860 contest by only 24 votes, Wallach published editorials in every Washington newspaper charging Berret with massive fraud in both elections. With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, the Republicans in the U.S. Congress pushed through legislation that required all public officers in Union territory to take oaths of allegiance to the United States. When Berret refused, insisting that his oath as mayor of the nation's capital should suffice, Secretary of State William H. Seward had him arrested, jailed in the Old Capitol Prison, then sent to Fort Lafayette, New York. Three weeks later, when no evidence of collaboration with the enemy surfaced, Seward had Berret released and returned to Washington—on the condition that he immediately resign as mayor. Berret telegraphed his resignation to the Washington City Council, who had already elected Wallach to replace him. Berret eventually became friends with Lincoln, although he declined when the President offered to appoint him commissioner of the emancipation of slaves in the District of Columbia. However, he accepted Ulysses S. Grant's nomination to the board of police commissioners in 1872, where he served until 1877. He moved back to Maryland and was an Elector for Maryland in 1888, and as such was named President of the Electoral College that year. He was returned to the Maryland legislature representing Carroll County in 1891, serving on the Ways and Means committee. He later served on the inaugural committee for President Grover Cleveland and as the first Vice- President of the Washington Monument Society.Inaugural ceremonies of Grover Cleveland, president and Adlai E. Stevenson, vice-president. March 4, 1893, Internet Archives. Berret died April 14, 1901, from the flu and was buried in Congressional Cemetery in Washington, DC. His last residence in Washington was at 1535 I Street N.W. The Berret School in Washington, DC was named in his honor. It was closed in the 1950s, but the building was eventually converted to condos in 2000 and it is now called the Berret School Lofts.

He was the uncle of film director Francis Ford Coppola and actress Talia Shire, as well as the great-uncle of Nicolas Cage, Sofia Coppola, Gian-Carlo Coppola, Jason Schwartzman and Robert Schwartzman, and the younger brother of American composer and musician Carmine Coppola. Life Coppola was born in Ocean Hill, Brooklyn, on March 21, 1917, but grew up mostly in East Harlem. He was the son of Maria (née Zasa) and Agostino Coppola, who came to the United States from Bernalda, Basilicata. Coppola started his career at the age of eight with the Metropolitan Opera Children's Chorus. At the age of 9 he was in the Met's debut of Turandot. He served as an army bandmaster during World War II, conductor at Radio City Music Hall and director of both the Symphony and Opera Departments at the Manhattan School of Music. He earned a bachelor's degree (1964) and a master's degree (1965) in composition from Manhattan School of Music and received honorary Doctorates from the University of Tampa and Quinnipiac University in Connecticut. Coppola's first marriage was to Marion Jane Miller, a ballet dancer, with whom he had one child, Susan Marion Coppola (1943–2008). After their divorce, he wed Almarinda Drago in 1950, also a ballet dancer, with whom he had two children, Lucia and Bruno Coppola. He became a great-great-grand-uncle in 2014 with the birth of his grand-nephew Nicolas Cage's grandson Lucian Augustus Coppola Cage and he turned 100 in March 2017. Works Among Coppola's compositions are a violin concerto, a symphony, and Sacco and Vanzetti, an opera in both Italian and English about immigrants Sacco and Vanzetti. In the 1950s and 1960s, Coppola was the musical director of six Broadway musicals, including Silk Stockings, Bravo Giovanni and The Boy Friend. He conducted two film scores, The Godfather Part III (1990) and Dracula (1992). He appeared in the former, shown conducting Cavalleria rusticana in the Teatro Massimo in Palermo. He debuted with the New York City Opera in 1965, conducting the world premiere of Jack Beeson's Lizzie Borden, and led performances of Carmen (with Beverly Wolff, Richard Cassilly and Norman Treigle), La traviata, Il barbiere di Siviglia, and Madama Butterfly during the same year. At the Seattle Opera in 1970, Coppola led the world premiere of Carlisle Floyd's Of Mice and Men. Coppola helped found Opera Tampa in 1996 and served as its Founding Artistic Director. Among his numerous productions with the company was the world premiere of Sacco and Vanzetti on March 17, 2001. He retired from the position in 2012. Coppola was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Puccini Foundation and recognized by the Italian government as Cavaliere, Gran Ufficiale. Coppola collaborated with the Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano Giuseppe Verdi, also known as Orchestra Verdi, and operatic soprano Angela Gheorghiu on a recording of Puccini works for EMI. This recording was later re-released with additional tracks recorded by Pappano and the Royal Opera House Orchestra, Covent Garden.  Award  In 2008, Opera Tampa announced that an award was to be established in his name. The Anton Coppola Excellence in the Arts Award is presented annually to recognize an artist for significant contributions to Opera Tampa and the music world at large, and specifically for extraordinary work in the cultivation and care of the operatic art form.

Education Born in New York City, Willig graduated from Rabbi Jacob Joseph School and received a B.A. in mathematics in 1968 from Yeshiva College and an M.S. in Jewish history in 1971 from the Bernard Revel Graduate School of Jewish Studies. He was a student of the late Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik. Professional life In 1973, Rabbi Willig was appointed as rosh yeshiva at the Mazer School of Talmudic studies at Yeshiva University and holds that position, along with the position of rosh kollel at RIETS. Rabbi Willig has been the rabbi and spiritual leader at the Young Israel of Riverdale Synagogue, in Riverdale, The Bronx, New York, since 1974.

Lanner case In 1989, Rabbi Willig led a Bet Din that heard allegations of abuse by Rabbi Baruch Lanner. The Bet Din found Lanner guilty of only three minor charges and found three other charges to be unsubstantiated. The Bet Din read their determination to the litigants, to the Rabbinical Council of Bergen County, and to Lanner's two employers, the Orthodox Union and a synagogue in New Milford, New Jersey. On February 19, 2003, Rabbi Willig publicly apologized for reaching what he eventually realized to be incorrect conclusions and for other \\"mistakes\\" made during the 1989 Bet Din proceedings. He noted that since the Bet Din did not have experience adjudicating matters of abuse, they should not have agreed to take the case. A report prepared in 2000 by a special commission appointed to investigate the Orthodox Union and Rabbi Willig's Bet Din role in the Lanner case critiqued the failure of taking action and thus allowing Lanner's abusive actions to \\"continue unchecked for many years.\\" Family Rabbi Willig resides with his wife in Riverdale, New York, New York.

Early life  Doggart was born exactly one year before the death of Queen Victoria. Remembering his childhood, he wrote: Motor cars were rare, slow and often out of action, so that we had plenty of scope for spinning-tops, games with marbles and cherry-stones, tipcat, and a bowler and hoop… Riding on a milk cart was a special treat. One stood up beside the driver, behind those jangling, swinging cans, out of which the driver would ladle measures of milk. (Reflections in a Family Mirror, Red House, 2002)  First World War  Doggart's first year at King's College, Cambridge was spent in the shadow of war, helped him to learn that lesson. When he went up to read medicine at King's in 1917, many of the young men who would have become his friends were dying in the trenches. Most of the dons who would have taught him were in Whitehall. There were only ten undergraduates at King's that year, including a seriously wounded soldier, two choral scholars, and two visiting students from India and China. He filled the grim emptiness by throwing himself into his medical studies. He sailed through chemistry, physics, biology, anatomy and physiology, and finished two years of medical studies in one. In May 1918, he persuaded the Admiralty to accept him as a surgeon- probationer and began his first job in medicine, as an anaesthetist. There were no antibiotics or blood transfusions. The only anaesthetics available were chloroform and ether. His notes from the period express particular distress at wounds involving the knee-joint, and the regularity of gangrene- induced amputations. The quality of Jimmy's work earned him a transfer to , a newly built destroyer. Its mission was to escort troopships across the Channel, and to carry out anti-submarine patrols. Jimmy's medical duties were limited to treating engine-room artificers for burns and distributing medicines for venereal diseases. His literary abilities were exploited with the job of keeping code systems and other confidential books up to date, and with the unenviable task of censoring letters. If he was lucky to escape a German submarine attack in the Channel, he was even more fortunate to survive influenza, contracted while on leave in Cambridge. This was no normal ‘flu bug, but a pandemic that swept the world. It would claim more lives than World War One itself. In hospital, Jimmy saw young men who had survived the Somme killed by influenza. Thanks to a kindly nurse who gave him extra quantities of castor oil, Jimmy recovered within a month, just in time to celebrate the Armistice declaration.  Cambridge and the Apostles  Doggart returned to King’s, sharing rooms with his brother Graham Doggart, and enjoying a rebirth of university life: > 1919 was a most exciting time to be in Cambridge. Undergraduates of mixed > ages poured in. A few had gone up in 1913, joining the Forces at the > outbreak of the War… John Maynard Keynes resigned from the Treasury, > violently disapproving of Lloyd George's policies at the Versailles Peace > Conference, and got back to King’s for the May term of 1919… The Fox-trot, > the One-step and the Waltz dominated the dancing world, and the girls of > Girton and Newnham, duly chaperoned in those conventional times, were > ardently courted… There were the Pitt Club, the Hawks, the Footlights and a > host of friends at King’s and in other colleges, and games of rugger. I did > very little solid work, and of course I fell in love. (ibid, 2002) It was in Keynes’ rooms at King's where friend and writer Peter Lucas introduced Jimmy to a secret society known as the Apostles. Founded in 1829, this elite group of intellectual Jedis boasted Alfred Tennyson and Rupert Brooke amongst its past members. During Jimmy's association, fellow Apostles included philosophers Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, writer Lytton Strachey, Soviet spies Anthony Blunt and Guy Burgess, novelist E.M. Forster and future Provosts of King's Jack Sheppard and Noel Annan. Members took it in turns to read a paper on a philosophical or academic issue, which became the basis for lively debates. Jimmy forged some of his closest friendships among the Apostles, who brought him into contact with leading lights of the Bloomsbury group, such as Virginia Woolf, Duncan Grant and Dora Carrington. His correspondence with Forster, Carrington and Strachey remained vigorous and affectionate until their deaths. “Even my well-known cynicism”, Strachey wrote in a 1920 letter, “melts away under your benevolent beams, and I’ve hardly a jibe left.” (ibid, 2002) Jimmy's intellectual and personal adventures deepened his love for Cambridge and, specifically, King's College—the evening light on the Cam; the naked opening note of Once in Royal David's City; January snow on the crown of Henry VI's statue. King's became the place he cherished the most for the rest of his life.  Early medical career  Jimmy's appreciation of hard-won success grew out of his own experience with failure. Perhaps his bitterest setbacks were suffered in his medical training after leaving Cambridge in July 1920. He failed papers on medicine, surgery and midwifery on three increasingly painful occasions. After those intellectual body-blows, many people would have abandoned a medical career, but he persevered, and eventually prevailed. Indeed, the exam failures prompted him to take a careful look at what direction he wanted his career to take, and led him to find his real vocation: eye work. In February 1923, he landed a job as an ophthalmic house surgeon, and embarked on a further round of studies. His commitment to medicine was strengthened by a six-month stint as a casualty officer at the Royal Northern Hospital: > There were all manner of injuries, ranging from people brought in dead from > a motor crash, down to the cuts and bruises. On one day in February 1926 I > treated seventeen people for fractures sustained in toboganing on Hampstead > Heath and in Kenwood. There are few sensations more satisfactory, I think, > than the slide of the head of the humerus back into its socket when one > reduces a dislocated shoulder. (ibid, 2002) His self-belief was tested again in May 1927, when he failed his preliminary exams to qualify as an ophthalmic surgeon. He resumed preparations, took the exams, and failed again. “This was very discouraging,” he wrote, “because I was no further on. The people teaching the course had all expected me to get through.” (ibid, 2002) He struggled on and, in December 1928, passed the Final Fellowship exam: I could have let out a yell of joy and relief. The formal words of welcome were pronounced by Sir Cuthbert Wallace who, as Dean of the Medical School of St. Thomas’, had rebuked me a few years earlier for being so frivolous as to go off to South America before I had qualified. (ibid, 2002) In fact, that trip was not only Jimmy's first journey outside Europe; it led to his first significant contribution to medical research. The adventure came about when the eminent scientist Joseph Barcroft invited him to join an Anglo- American expedition to Peru to study the physiology of mountain sickness. The group sailed from Liverpool in November 1921, stopped off at Havana, before passing through the Panama Canal on the way to the Peruvian port of Callao. In Peru, they spent the entire winter, huddled in a converted railway baggage car at Cerro de Pasco, 14,000 feet above sea level. Jimmy was entranced by South America, where he returned to lecture on various occasions. Jimmy's love of travel started with childhood seaside holidays in the north of England, the pierrot troupe on Saltburn beach remembered with particular pleasure. He loved Scotland, where his daughter Sonia would spend much of her life: An enchanting land, offering hills to climb, burns to cross, glorious scones, cookies and cinnamon balls and of course boats, especially the kinds that you could propel standing up, by means of a single oar resting on a concave notch in the stern. (ibid, 2002) A lecture tour to the Soviet Union in 1957 with his lifelong friend Patrick Trevor-Roper yielded new adventures. Throughout his life, Jimmy was an enthusiastic sportsman. During the First World War, he sought out edelweiss-rare rugger matches. Between the wars, he rock-climbed, skated, and played golf. He played cricket for Cambridge University and for St Thomas's Hospital, where his fast right arm led the team to two successive victories in the inter-hospital Cup Final.  Personal life  Jimmy was a romantic in the field of love as well as travel. His writings refer to his impulsiveness and suggest that, like Odysseus under the spell of the Sirens, he was bewitched by beautiful women – especially the dangerous ones—throughout his youth. At age five, while attending Westholm School for Girls: I felt the first pangs of love, especially for the three fascinating Errington sisters, one word from any of whom would produce an ecstasy of tongue-tied blushes. (ibid, 2002) At Cambridge, he attracted much female attention. Virginia Woolf describes him affectionately in her diaries as a “spruce innocent young man; with eyes like brown trout streams.” (The Diary of Virginia Woolf, Volume 2 1920–24, Penguin, 1981, p. 8) Jimmy Doggart during World War II In 1919, Jimmy became romantically involved with a girl at Newnham, but the engagement was short- lived: the attractions of a single life were still too great. In Montreal, he wrote: “I was astonished at the glorious complexions of all the girls in that cold crisp air.” A year later, at the Downside Ball in London: “all the girls were beautiful and walked like panthers.” In 1925, he began a flirtatious correspondence with Dora Carrington which lasted six years. He became engaged for the second time, to a girl whom he had met at a dance in Leicester. He temporarily abandoned his studies for her because, as he explains: “being in a hurry to get married, I did not like the prospect of examinations looming up at me.” He broke off the relationship. Little is known about his first marriage. His writings allude only to the bare facts. In 1928, he met Doris Mennell, and married her the following year. They had one daughter, Sonia. They separated in 1931, and the marriage was formally dissolved in 1938. Jimmy met the love of his life, Leonora Sharpley, in October 1936. They were introduced at a dinner party hosted by Sebastian and Honor Earl, the niece of one of their favourite writers, Somerset Maugham. ‘Leo’ was an elegant lady with an aquiline nose, a mellifluous voice, and a seraphic lightness of movement. She was born in Lincoln in 1904. Her father, George Sharpley, was a stern, devout man who ran a heavy engineering business and was also High Sheriff of Lincoln. Leo grew up with two sisters, to whom she was close. After leaving school, she went to art college in London. She met and married a theatre impresario, Jack Gatti, with whom she had two fiercely independent sons, John and Peter. Jack found the starlets appearing in his theatre irresistible. The marriage collapsed. When they first met, Leo and Jimmy were both emerging from painful divorces. About a year later, Jimmy proposed to Leo, who Leo accepted. The couple were married in London on 7 May 1938. Jimmy's marriage was the bedrock on which he built his successful career. His gaze ceased wandering to pretty nurses and focused instead on using medicine to make a real difference to the world.  Second World War  His first big challenge came soon after his wedding, with the outbreak of the Second World War. He negotiated a posting as a Wing Commander in the RAF Medical Branch in Blackpool. Surrounded by some 30,000 airmen, he soon found himself testing the eyesight of up to 100 men a day. Over the next five years, the Central Medical Establishment sent him to hospitals and camps in Wales, Buckinghamshire, Hereford, Gloucester and London. He treated scores of airmen who returned from bombing raids over continental Europe with eye injuries. He saved the sight of many.  Work  Near the end of the war, Jimmy began work on a pioneering book on childhood eye diseases. It was the start of the most productive period of his career. The book was published in 1947 and became a core textbook in the field. He followed it up with a companion book, Children’s eye nursing, and then, in 1949, with two other books – Ophthalmic Medicine and Ocular Signs in Slit-Lamp Microscopy. These publications turned him into a leading player in the world of ophthalmology. His workload mushroomed, and he found himself juggling all kinds of responsibilities. He ran between consultancy appointments at Moorfields, St George's and Great Ormond Street hospitals, and still managed to find time to serve a growing private practice. He presided over the Faculty of Ophthalmology and sat on a host of other medical committees. He wrote numerous papers for medical journals and became an editor on the British Journal of Ophthalmology. He was a highly sought-after lecturer on the international circuit and a patient teacher at various hospitals. He even pushed ophthalmology into the political field, lobbying parliament to outlaw boxing because of the eye damage it causes. Jimmy's career spanned a period of enormous advances in medical technology, from the development of antibiotics to the introduction of laser surgery. He played a part in this progress through his own teaching and research work, and by spearheading a new means of advancing medical knowledge – global networking. At conferences, through exchange programs, by written correspondence, and as a member of the Order of the Knights of St. John, Jimmy forged links between doctors and eye specialists around the world – from the Soviet Union to Australia, Argentina to the United States. He created an informal World Wide Web for medical research.  Family  Jimmy Doggart with his wife Leonora and son Tony Leo gave birth to her and Jimmy's only child, Anthony Hamilton Doggart, in 1940, and moved to a cottage near Marlborough, safely tucked away from German bombs. Or so she thought. On her way to visit Jimmy in Blackpool, she was caught in an unexpected air raid in Cheltenham. The bomb just missed her railway carriage. Fire raged around her. She calmly picked up her bags and headed straight for the house of Drummond Currie, Jimmy's dissecting partner from his Cambridge days. She helped Mrs Currie make tea and successfully completed her journey to Blackpool the following day. Leo missed her husband's company and found a house in Wendover, near to his airbase at RAF Halton. She made the move in a small Austin car, with a chicken-house on a trailer. In those years of scarcity, the chickens were a major asset, ensuring that Tony had a regular supply of soft-boiled eggs. Jimmy was similarly enterprising as a parent. He once arranged an aircraft trip to St. Eval, near to where his daughter Sonia's school had been evacuated, and paid her a surprise visit. In 1943, he cleverly purchased a large house in Cambridge called Binsted, on the site of what is now Robinson College. He, Leo and Tony moved in during the summer of 1946, and Binsted became their first stable home. Leo and Jimmy's roots became increasingly intertwined as shared friendships strengthened. Jimmy's university friend Jack Sheppard became Provost of King's and they saw a lot of each other. Leo's Sunday lunch parties (and her Queen's Pudding) became famous, invitations eagerly accepted. Some of their closest friends were Noel and Gaby Annan, Tim Munby, Patrick Wilkinson and the man whom Jimmy called “the best man-friend I ever had, and the wisest man I ever knew” – his brother Graham Doggart. Leo loved laughing and gossiping with her friends, the closest of whom were Nora David, who later spoke for Labour on education in the House of Lords, and Joyce Carey, the actress at the centre of Noël Coward’s circle. Jimmy’s work required him to spend weekdays in London where he spent many evenings with friends at the Garrick Club. A painting still hangs there, depicting a trip by Garrick members to the Derby. Jimmy is portrayed rapt in conversation with a colourfully dressed gypsy woman. More interested in the mythic than the mundane, he seems unaware that a smudge-faced child, possibly the son of the gypsy, is sneaking his little hand into his pocket.  Later years  In 1962, Leo and Jimmy sold Binsted and moved to a townhouse off Kensington Church Street. In 1970, they moved to Albury Park, a stately Victorian retirement home in Surrey. It was a magically timeless place, with palatial gravel paths and rose gardens, a Saxon chapel, and a terrace designed in the 17th century by John Evelyn. Here, they devoted great energies to educating and entertaining their two grandchildren, Sebastian Doggart and Nike Doggart. Some of Jimmy’s closest friends were writers he had never met. Perhaps his closest friend of all was Homer, in whose tales of nobility and adventure he found a kindred spirit. As an undergraduate, he read the Iliad in Greek on the banks of the Cam. The classics provided an escape from the realities of the Second World War: I was spending two and a half hours in the train six days a week, practically all that time reading Homer and other Greek authors. (ibid, 2002) Jimmy and Leo shared many literary ‘friends’, including Jane Austen, Somerset Maugham, Rudyard Kipling and the Brontë sisters. Jimmy would often read these authors aloud to Leo, who listened intently as she embroidered exotic parrots on cushion covers. As in all good couples, they had their private friends. Jimmy favoured Aristophanes, Thucydides, and Plato; Leo had weaknesses for Barbara Cartland and Nigel Dempster. Jimmy had rather more literary enemies, especially D. H. Lawrence, whom he slammed as vulgar and amoral, and urged others never to read. Jimmy had a hard time growing old. Moving from a hectic career into retirement was a tough task. He set about creating projects to fill the time. He combined his literary and charitable energies into reading books onto cassettes for the blind. He approached this as a craft, taking speaking lessons so that his recordings flowed freely. His listeners, attached to the charity Calibre, rewarded him with a steady stream of fan mail, appreciative of his performances as Mr. Darcy or Charles Strickland. Deep down, old age infuriated him. He was mindful of his cherished friend Somerset Maugham's last words that “dying is a very dull dreary affair and my advice to you is to have nothing whatsoever to do with it.” The deterioration in his eyesight – the very gift he had devoted his life to preserving in other people—forced him to stop reading for the blind. That was a cruel sleight of fate. His depression became clearer with every passing year. His face lit up when he saw his children or grandchildren. His family was his only Prozac, and, unlike Leo, he did not have religion to lean on. Jimmy's Christianity had been destroyed at the age of seven, when his father subjected him to Total Immersion. His rejection of his father's Baptist beliefs became a source of inner turmoil throughout his life. On the one hand, he disagreed with what he saw as his father's religious intolerance and blinkered piety; on the other, he was mindful of his filial duties: My father would have swooned for joy if I had decided to be a medical missionary, but alas, it is impossible to turn these things like a tap, just to oblige another, even if that other is owed an enormous debt of gratitude. (ibid, 2002) Although he found no truth in organized religion, he did find God's hand in both nature and mankind. Sitting alone in a box at the Royal Festival Hall, he found God listening to Fritz Kreisler playing the violin. He found Him in the first crocuses of springtime and looking through a microscope at a child's retina. He found him in the echo of Homer's “rosy-fingered dawn.” And he found Him, infinitely, in the fanned vaulting of King's Chapel. Jimmy Doggart died 15 October 1989, aged 89 years, 266 days.
