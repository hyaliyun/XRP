While primarily a third baseman, Valbuena also played second base and first base. He was killed in a car crash in 2018 in Venezuela caused by bandits in an attempted robbery. Early life Valbuena grew up in Sucre, a municipality in the Venezuelan state of Zulia. He was raised by a single mother named Nelly, who was the president of the local youth baseball league. Valbuena's older brother and several uncles helped him learn to play baseball. Professional career Seattle Mariners Valbuena began his professional career in the Seattle Mariners organization in 2005.

Valbuena hit his first major league home run off of Bartolo Col√≥n on June 7, 2009. Valbuena in 2011 In July 2011, the Indians optioned Valbuena to Triple-A Columbus, to make room for the promotion of rookie second baseman Jason Kipnis. In August 2011, Valbuena was recalled after Kipnis was put on the disabled list with an oblique injury. He was designated for assignment and removed from the 40-man roster on November 18.

With Jed Lowrie coming off the disabled list and Carlos Correa taking over the primary shortstop position, Valbuena was forced to share some of the first base duties along with Chris Carter and utility player Marwin Gonz√°lez in order to get some playing time. At the beginning of the 2016 season, Valbuena was the starting third baseman for the Astros. He began to split playing time between first and third base. With the call-up of Astros prospect Alex Bregman, Valbuena saw more playing time at first base.

Construction Impeccable was built by American Shipbuilding, Tampa, Florida. The contract was awarded on 28 March 1991. The ship's keel was laid down on 15 March 1992, but the Tampa shipyards went bankrupt by November 1993. On 3 December 1992, the General Accounting Office published a report that concluded that T-AGOS 24‚Äì27 should not be built. Shortly afterwards the government decided to discontinue this class of ships, but Impeccable was to be completed as the sole ship in her class. The hull was towed to Gulfport, Mississippi, in 1995 where she was finished by Halter Marine Inc. She was launched on 28 August 1998 and was delivered to the Navy on 22 March 2001 which assigned her to the Military Sealift Command (MSC) Special Missions Program. Design The ship is a designated T-AGOS vessel built to tow a Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System. The ship's catamaran- type small waterplane area twin hull (SWATH) design prevents the vessel from rolling in heavy seas and gives additional deck space for storing the acoustic equipment. Mission The mission of Impeccable is to directly support the Navy by using SURTASS passive and active low frequency sonar arrays to detect and track undersea threats. Operational history Low Frequency Active Sonar *The SURTASS Low Frequency Active Sonar system, onboard Impeccable, commenced sea trials in late February 2004. During the spring and summer of 2004, Impeccable conducted five training missions in the Philippine Sea and the northwest Pacific Ocean. All LFA sonar operations included the operation of the High Frequency / Marine Mammal Mitigation sonar and compliance with all mitigation requirements. * Total operational days on board the Impeccable using the LFA array: :(15 August 2003 to 15 August 2004) 26.2 days with 63.0 hours of transmissions :(15 August 2004 to 15 August 2005) 9.4 days with 22.7 hours of transmissions :(15 August 2005 to 15 August 2006) 22.5 days with 39.4 hours of transmissions. *The ship had five years of active and passive operations in the Western Pacific before the incident in the South China Sea. South China Sea incidents Two Chinese trawlers stop directly in front of the Impeccable, forcing the ship to conduct an emergency \\"all stop\\" in order to avoid collision. On 5 March 2009, the Impeccable was in the South China Sea monitoring submarine activity when it was approached by a People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) frigate, which crossed its bow at a range of approximately 100 yards without first making contact. This was followed less than two hours later by a Chinese Y-12 aircraft, conducting 11 flyovers of Impeccable at an altitude of and a range from . The frigate then crossed Impeccables bow again, this time at a range of approximately 400‚Äì500 yards. On 7 March, a Chinese intelligence ship contacted the Impeccable over bridge-to-bridge radio, calling her operations illegal and directing Impeccable to leave the area or \\"suffer the consequences.\\" One Chinese crewmen waves a Chinese flag, while another uses a grappling hook to try to snag Impeccable's towed sonar array. On 8 March 2009, the Impeccable was 75 miles south of Hainan, China, when it was shadowed by five Chinese ships: a Bureau of Maritime Fisheries Patrol Vessel, a State Oceanic Administration patrol vessel, a PLA Navy ocean surveillance ship, and two Chinese-flagged naval trawlers, which maneuvered close to the Impeccable, with two closing in to , waving Chinese flags, and ordering the Impeccable from the area. The Impeccable sprayed water at one of the nearest Chinese ships; the Chinese sailors stripped down to their underwear and their vessel closed in to within 25 feet of the American ship. Shortly after the incident, the Impeccable radioed the Chinese crews, informing them of its intentions to leave the area, and requesting a safe pass to travel. When it was trying to leave the area, the two Chinese trawlers dropped pieces of wood in the Impeccables path and stopped directly in front of it, forcing it to do an emergency stop to avoid a collision. Once the Impeccable got under way, the crew aboard one of the trawlers used a grappling hook to try to snag Impeccable's towed sonar array. The Hainan Submarine Base is on the island of Hainan. The nearby Paracel Islands are administered by China, but claimed by both Vietnam and Taiwan The United States lodged formal protests following the incident, stating that under international law, the U.S. military can conduct activities \\"in waters beyond the territorial sea of another state without prior notification or consent\\" including in an exclusive economic zone of another country. \\"The unprofessional maneuvers by Chinese vessels violated the requirement under international law to operate with due regard for the rights and safety of other lawful users of the ocean.\\" China's Foreign Ministry responded that the Pentagon's complaints that five Chinese vessels had harassed the Impeccable were \\"totally inaccurate\\", although this claim was disputed by several released reports, which all state that the Impeccable was interfered with numerous times, both while operating in the area and when attempting to leave. On 12 March 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama gave the go-ahead to send the guided missile destroyer to the South China Sea to protect the Impeccable while operating in that area. Hans M. Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists has suggested that the incident may be related to the classified Type 093 submarine that the Chinese navy had recently deployed in the area. =Views on the legality of US and Chinese actions during these incidents= China and the United States both maintain the rightfulness of their actions based on competing interpretations of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The United States maintains that the Convention, which it has signed, but not yet ratified, authorizes activities such as those undertaken by Impeccable. Several legal experts also state that there is no legal foundation for China's claim that it can prevent foreign naval vessels from operating within its Exclusive Economic Zone. For example, Raul Pedrozo, writing in the Chinese Journal of International Law, concludes that \\"all nations may legitimately engage in military activities in foreign exclusive economic zones, without prior notice to, or consent of, the coastal State concerned.\\" On the contrary, Chinese officials assert that the operations are illegal. Rear Admiral Wang Dengping, political commissar of the Armament Department of the Chinese Navy, condemned the Impeccable's activities, stating that \\"Innocent passage by naval vessels from other countries in the Territorial waters in the Special Economic Zone is acceptable, but not allowed otherwise\\" under the Convention. Chinese actions were further defended by Professor Ji Guoxing of Shanghai Jiao Tong University who, writing in China Security, maintained that under the Convention, navigation rights in coastal countries' exclusive economic zones are \\"subject to the resource-related and environment-related laws and regulations of the coastal state,\\" and China could exclude the Impeccable on this basis. Ji further asserted that the Convention's prohibition against gathering military intelligence in another country's territorial waters should be interpreted to also prohibit intelligence gathering in coastal countries' exclusive economic zones. 2015 rescue at sea On July 19, 2015 while en route for a scheduled port visit to Subic Bay, USNS Impeccable (T-AGOS 23) rescued 11 fishermen. Impeccable sailors spotted personnel on a partially submerged ship and noted debris in the water. \\"They [Impeccable crew] initially spotted only eight people on the partially submerged vessel,\\" said Lt. Cory Hilgart, the theater anti-submarine watch officer at Commander, Task Force 74. \\"They then realized that it was actually 11 and made the call to commence the rescue effort.\\" The Impeccables master immediately deemed assistance was required and began preparations to deploy their rigid hull inflatable boat (RHIB) to rescue the personnel. \\"This was a team effort with civilian mariners, SECDET [security detachment], MILDET [military detachment] and Lockheed Martin working together to achieve an efficient rescue of all 11 fishermen,\\" said Robert Wiechert, Master of the Impeccable. The RHIB made three trips to the distressed vessel and recovered all eleven individuals. \\"One of the crew members spoke English,\\" said Hilgart. \\"He told the Impeccable crew that they were fishermen from the Subic Bay region. He confirmed that there were only 11 on board.\\" Once the mariners were brought aboard Impeccable, they were examined by medical personnel and given food and water. No serious injuries or illnesses were reported. Shortly after Impeccable arrived in port in Subic Bay, July 20, the mariners were turned over to the Philippine Coast Guard.

This is a comprehensive listing of notable characters from the video game Xenogears, a role-playing video game originally released in 1998 by Square Enix for the PlayStation video game console. Kunihiko Tanaka was the lead character designer, while Tetsuya Takahashi and Masato Kato were the lead writers for the game. Xenogears was a commercial and critical success. The readers of Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu voted Xenogears the 16th best video game of all time in a 2006 poll. Xenogears follows the character Fei and his friends as they learn about Deus, a powerful, self-aware interplanetary invasion system that crashed onto the planet ten thousand years before the game's story begins. Deus has been secretly controlling the gradually increasing population of the planet to one day bring about its own resurrection. Fei and Elly, the main protagonists, have been reincarnated throughout history in order to ensure that Deus never achieves its goal. Opposed to Fei and Elly, Miang, the embodiment of Deus and the main antagonist, has reincarnated several times to manipulate the progress of mankind. Creation and development The characters of Xenogears were designed to allude to many psychological concepts, notably of Freudian and Jungian psychology. An important character bears the name of French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, Fei: In that dream, I was called 'Lacan'... I was an artist... but the most obvious allusion involves the protagonist, Fei Fong Wong, whose Freudian id, ego and super-ego are discussed at length throughout the course of the game. Fei had subconsciously repressed his memories because of his torturous childhood, but his desire to remember his past eventually leads him to discover the truth about his identity and his relationship with the character Id. This repression also relates to the Jungian concept of the shadow. Distinctly Adlerian in nature, however, are the actions of certain characters, such as Ramsus, whose actions are driven by an inferiority complex that stems from unconscious 'nodes' that often permeate exterior behaviors of an individual. Although not distinctly psychological, allusions to the theories of Friedrich Nietzsche are also found in the game. For example, there is the concept of the eternal return, which, in Xenogears, correlates to the recurrences of the Contact and the Antitype. Main protagonists Fei Fong Wong ' is the game's protagonist, whose name alludes to the legendary Wong Fei Hung and is exactly the same as Hung when written in katakana. When the game opens, Fei has lived in the village of Lahan for three years and has no memory of events prior to his arrival. It is soon learned that Fei has a tendency to lose control of himself when he feels fear or anger. When Lahan is attacked, he steps into the cockpit of an abandoned giant fighting robot with the intent of protecting the town, but becomes responsible for laying it to waste. Afterwards, Fei joins with Citan Uzuki and other allies to uncover the web of deception and manipulation surrounding Solaris, and ultimately, Deus. A strong fighter, Fei fights with his bare fists in battle, and his special techniques are known as \\"Chi\\". Fei experiences frequent periods of memory loss and unknowingly has a split personality Id, the product of Fei's pain and anguish at a critically young age. This pain split his mind into three personas: the monster Id, the childlike \\"coward\\", and the artificial persona Fei, designed to shield Id from reality. These personas were designed to map to the Freudian ideas of the id, ego and super-ego. When Fei was a child, his mother was possessed by Miang's spirit, who experimented heavily with Fei as he was the \\"Contact\\" and one of numerous reincarnations of , the sole survivor of the crash of the spaceship Eldridge thousands of years prior. Fei's first incarnation Abel grew up along with the original Elehaym ten thousand years prior to the game's story. They were both killed in a rebellion against the world's ruler, Cain. The second Contact, , appeared in the Zeboim era, four thousand years before the game's start. He was Emeralda's creator, although Miang destroyed his technology and he went into hiding afterwards. During the Solaris War five hundred years prior to the game, the Contact appeared as the painter . Joining the rebellion against Solaris, he met Krelian and Sophia, the corresponding incarnation of Elehaym. When Sophia was killed during battle, Lacan decided to destroy the world, turning into Grahf and freeing the Contact to be reincarnated again later as Fei. The character of Fei has been called \\"a mystery for the player to follow and solve on their own\\" by IGN. Edge said of Fei that he \\"in some ways, conforms to the classic stereotypical lead character, but we quickly discover he‚Äôs anything but a blank canvas. Within an hour of play Fei has leveled his home village in an act of brutal destruction, killing his best friends ‚Äì who you were busily helping prepare for their wedding the next day.\\" The world of Xenogears was originally designed as more \\"pastoral\\" than the final result, and Lahan was planned to have a \\"martial arts\\" feel. As the game's script was written this was changed, but the design of Fei, meant to fit in with the original conception, was not able to be revised in the time allotted and remained wearing a martial arts uniform. This led to director Tetsuya Takahashi feeling that his character design was out of place, especially in the latter half of the game. The version of Fei in Zeboim, Kim, was designed with a lab coat and modern Japanese clothing to demonstrate that Zeboim society was similar to modern society. Lacan was intended to have a different design than Fei, but due to time constraints was instead left with the same artwork, and was justified with the idea that Lacan's memories were shared with Fei, who projected his own self-image into them. Elly Van Houten Elly in the Japanese instruction manual. ', nicknamed ', is a young skilled officer of Gebler who meets Fei in the forest near Lahan Village. Elly was leading an operation to steal a top-secret experiment gear from Kislev, but was forced to crash-land in Lahan and was partially responsible for the destruction of the village. Her encounter with Fei changes her life forever. Elly is an optimist, and wants to help Fei, despite the fact that he is a land dweller and that she cannot leave the military. She is a competent fighter with her rods and has elemental ether attacks. Known as the -Antitype-, she has been reincarnated numerous times throughout history along with Fei, her previous incarnation being , the Holy Mother of Nisan. Citan Uzuki ' is a medical doctor who lives up the mountain path from Lahan with his wife (granddaughter of the Shevat Guru Gaspar), and his daughter . Despite living on the surface, Citan was born in Solaris, and his real name is '. Citan is a Solaris Guardian Angel, and is working under instructions from the Solaris Emperor to observe Fei to see if he will bring relief or destruction to the world.Citan:I am sorry. I did not want to say anything until I was sure. I was on a secret mission by orders of Emperor Cain to monitor Fei. He ordered me to determine whether Fei would be a threat to the world or not. 'The Contact'... That is what the Emperor calls Fei... A very smart individual, Citan is responsible for the development of many of the Gears seen in the game. He has a history with multiple individuals, including Ramsus, Sigurd and Jessie. Citan initially fights with his bare fists but acquires a sword later in the game. During his combos, he moves so fast he has afterimages trailing his movement. When using his sword, Citan always draws and strikes with it in a single motion. Citan's special techniques are known as \\"Arcane\\" magic. Bart Fatima ', nicknamed ', is the leader of a group of sand pirates who ride the submarine Yggdrasil. He befriends Fei and Citan after shooting down a prison ship that they were on. Bart is the rightful heir to the kingdom of Aveh, his family having been forced out of the country by Ethos agent Shakhan years before.Citan:Bartholomew? Edbart IV's successor... I am sure they announced Bartholomew dies of an illness 12 years ago. Maison:Officially, yes. However, in reality, we rescued the young prince from Shakhan's evil grasp. Citan:Then why must the prince, the rightful heir, resort to piracy... Bart is constantly accompanied by his mentor and half-brother, , as well as the well- mannered . He uses a whip in battle. Bart and Sigurd are each missing an eye (Bart's left and Sigurd's right) and wear identical eyepatches. Bart's ancestors and were fraternal twin brothers who founded Aveh, and were comrades of Lacan and Sophia during the rebellion against Solaris. Their names are a reference to Edgar Roni Figaro and Sabin Rene Figaro, characters from Final Fantasy VI who were created by Xenogears co-writer Kaori Tanaka. Rico Banderas ', nicknamed ', is a massive demi-human and champion Gear fighter in Nortune, the imperial capital of Kislev.Hammer:I am telling you it is hopeless! To do that you will have to defeat the current champion, Master Rico! He has a sturdy reputation, and his size can be frightening. Despite being a prisoner, his lifestyle is superior to that of many nobles and he appears to have a connection with the Kislev ruler. Rico is one of the game's strongest physical characters, but also the slowest and with one of the lower accuracy ratings. Billy Lee Black ' is introduced as a young, pacifistic priest of the Ethos religion, and later is revealed as a member of the Etone branch, which job is to \\"clean\\" and \\"purge\\" the world from the Reapers, or -Wels-. He has a problematic relationship with his father (real name: ), who abandoned his family for a number of years after they moved to the surface from Solaris.Billy:I don't know the details but you have been labeled as an undesirable element. What did you do this time? Fight? Gamble? Go after someone's wife again? Jessie:Hmph, that's just a rumor about me. A rumor. Don't you believe that. Ever since you went into the 'Ethos' you've become such a stiff. Having been mentored by the Ethos leader Bishop Stone, Billy dedicated his life to religion and cares for many children including his younger sister at an Ethos orphanage. Billy's sports a trio of guns in battle and also wields a number of useful support \\"Ether\\" spells. Maria Balthasar ' is a young girl residing in Shevat who pilots Seibzehn, a special Gear her father, Nikolai, created to protect her home. Her father was kidnapped by Solaris to make new Gears, thus giving Maria a large grudge against Solaris.'Maria:Yes... but I haven't seen him for the past few years... He said he was looking for something very important. And he left by himself... My father was captured by Solaris and his whereabouts are not known either... I'm glad Grandpa Bal's doing fine. Maria's grandfather is the gear engineer Balthasar. Although her gear is powerful, Maria's physical attacks are weak. However, she can use ether attacks to call Seibzehn to attack enemies, even in enclosed areas. Chu-Chu Once mistaken by Bart as a stuffed animal, ' was with Marguerite during the teenage girl's imprisonment in Fatima Castle. Her race once lived in the woods, but due to Solaris's activities, they became almost extinct. Some managed to escape to Shevat and live with Wiseman. Chu- Chu can grow to the size of a gear once the physical part of the limiter is removed. She has the unique ability to heal other gears, and doesn't need any fuel to fight, but has poor stats and no special attacks in \\"gear\\" form. She has romantic interest for Fei but none of the characters notice and it spooks Fei at first.Chu-Chu:I'm Chu-Chu! I fell in love with you when I first saw you in Bledavik!! Emeralda Kasim ' is a nanomachine colony built to aid the human race. Kim Kasim (Fei‚Äôs second known incarnation) created Emeralda during the Zeboim era by analyzing Elly‚Äôs gene pattern, and creating a nanomachine colony.'Kim:This, this is the new spirit vessel that will break the curse. It hasn't awakened yet. The form was created by nanomachines, but neural simulation hasn't been done by the Assembler Tower yet. It's physically stable, but still doesn't function as a living creature yet. At the time, Miang was manipulating the government, and wanted to reset the human evolutionary cycle by starting a worldwide nuclear war. In the present, Emeralda is revived from an archeological site and is used by Krelian to enhance his nanomachine technology. She is used to guard a Solaris gate, but joins the party afterwards. At first, she seems unable to differentiate between Fei and his previous incarnation Kim, and responds to being told his name is Fei by calling him \\"Fei's Kim\\" for most of the remainder of the game. Emeralda's nanomachine-created body makes her a powerful ally in battle, and she possesses powerful ether spells as well. She does not use any weapons, but rather, she morphs her limbs (and hair) into various melee weapons while attacking. Emeralda initially has the appearance of a child, but an optional side quest late in the game causes her to assume the form of an adult woman. This transformation improves her stat growth tremendously. Main antagonists Deus ' is the core of an interplanetary invasion system, built ten thousand years prior to the game's story. Because of its power, Deus was placed on the Eldridge spaceship, but it soon became fully self aware and took control of the entire ship. When the captain of the Eldridge self- destructed his ship, Deus was not destroyed, crashing into a nearby planet. Deus then created The Complement named Hawwa (Miang), she gives birth to Emperor Cain and the Gazel Ministry. Hawwa's task was to establish a human civilization on the planet in order to one day use the humans for its resurrection. Because of the nature of Deus, much of the game's controversy stems from Fei's goal of killing the god that created mankind. This plot was the main reason as to why there were questions of a North American release of the game. Gazel Ministry The ' exists as the main governing body of Solaris. They were originally among the first human beings born on the planet. They were originally half of the core organic component of Deus, known as the 'Animus', and seek to realign with their respective 'Anima' (the Anima Relics).'Elly:Do you know why the Gazel Ministry desired the Anima Relics and your bodies? Well, here's the reason... Before becoming human, the bodies of the Ministry were once part of the organic elements in the core circuit that made up 'Deus'. There were two types of organic elements. The female type was called 'Anima', while the male type was called 'Animus'. The Ministry, which were Animus, were to become one again with their separated Anima at the time of the resurrection of god. Five hundred years before the events of the game, the Ministry were at odds with Miang, so they provided her to Shevat in exchange for the rebel army. Soon after this, they were killed by the mysterious Diabolos forces summoned by Grahf. Krelian eventually revived eight of the twelve ministers as computer data in the SOL-9000 after becoming part of Solaris.Citan:Once, during the Diabolos invasion, the Ministry elders died losing their bodies. Now, the Solaris governing Ministry exists as data in memory banks. Each of their personalities are bits of data. Throughout the game the Ministry is fearful of Fei and seek to destroy him because Fei is the reincarnation of Lacan, who was responsible for their original demise. They show utter disdain towards Ramsus because of his constant failure to defeat Fei and call him 'Trash'. At the same time, they seek to resurrect their bodies using the main characters, who are their descendants. The Ministry eventually becomes at odds with Emperor Cain when he prevents them from using the 'Gaetia Key', a device that will resurrect God's paradise, Mahanon. Because of Miang and Krelian's manipulation of Ramsus, he assassinates Cain for them and the Ministry goes ahead and uses the Key. Howevever, once the key has been used, Krelian has no more use for them and has them promptly deleted, wiping them out permanently.Gazel: What are you doing to the memory banks? Gazel: Do not touch them! We cannot survive without the...! Krelian: You were the only ones who could have activated the key. But now that it has been activated, I no longer need you. I am having you all erased. Grahf Calling himself \\"The Seeker of Power\\", ' is the persona of Lacan that split off after Lacan made contact with the Zohar five hundred years prior to the start of Xenogears influenced by Miang. Grahf is the personification of Lacan's will but is not considered to be the \\"original\\" Lacan (i.e. the \\"Contact\\"). The Contact, instead, transmigrated to be reborn in the body of Fei Fong Wong. Grahf's goal is to merge with Fei and thus reclaim his original form as \\"The Contact\\" then to awaken the weapon Deus and destroy all life. He came to the conclusion that this was the only path to freedom after his contact with the Existence as Lacan. Grahf learned the ability to pass on from body to body, thus granting him a form of eternal life. Grahf discovers the new incarnation of the Contact in Fei when Fei is still a child and attempts to meld with him. However, Fei's father, Khan, attempts to stop him. During their battle, Fei was unable to contain the powers passed onto him by the Existence and released a force so powerful that Fei's mother was killed. Grahf then took Fei who had awakened as Id. Id then trained under Grahf as an assassin, until Khan caught up to them. Grahf then tried to merge with Id(Fei) but Khan fought back and in the end defeated Grahf, Grahf then took over Khan's body, but not before Khan (as Wiseman) was able to take Fei to Lahan Village before the beginning of the game. Although he no longer possesses the full potential of \\"The Contact,\\" Grahf has immense strength and powers. He is more powerful than any other character except for Fei as \\"The Contact\\" (when all divisions of his personality merge). He can easily destroy gears with his bare hands and effortlessly defeats multiple omnigears (include Fei's Weltall 2 with System-Id) during the battle at Mahanon. However, he rarely fights directly, and instead on several occasions granted what he called \\"the Power\\" to defeated lesser villains, allowing them to challenge Fei and his friends with enhanced abilities. This power invariably leads to madness, and their resulting destruction. Grahf is finally defeated by Fei after the latter merges with all of his personalities and meets the Wave Existence. Now able to access his full powers, Fei's gear transforms into the Xenogears and engages Grahf in a one-on-one fight. Grahf is beaten and subsequently sacrifices himself to merge with the Zohar and delay the awakening of Deus, allowing Fei and party to escape and prepare for the final battle.Xenogears God and Mind - Grahf Id ' is Fei's split personality, created when Fei tried to repress his childhood memories about being abused by scientists acting as his mother. Throughout the game, Id appears when Fei is off screen. Fei is also unaware of Id until it is explained to him late in the game. Id represents Fei's id, adding a Freudian aspect to his character. Id is an often brutal and malicious character, violently seeking to destroy the planet by making contact with the Zohar. Kahran Ramsus ' commands Gebler alongside Miang and holds a prominent position in the hierarchy in Solaris. He was originally created in a nanoreactor by Miang and Krelian as a clone of the Emperor Cain, but was thrown away once Fei was discovered. He grew up in the Elements, a special Solaris fighting squad, and knew Citan, who was attracted to Ramsus' ideals against class distinctions. Ramsus grows obsessed with defeating Fei over the course of the game because it was Fei's existence that made Ramsus feel worthless.Fei:Ramsus' absolute confidence was shattered... Leaving only his cry of disbelief and resentment, Ramsus' machine disappeared into a sea of foliage. Why he was so fixated on me...I know not why. but he did say this... Ramsus:If only you didn't exist... Krelian ' is the secondary antagonist and the anti-hero of the game. He is the leader of Solaris, the antagonistic nation that controls the affairs of much of the world. Initially a land dweller, Krelian's scientific knowledge has enabled him to prolong his life and exert power over the Solaris' Emperor Cain and the main governing body, the Gazel Ministry. After the death of his beloved Sophia centuries ago, Krelian became convinced that God did not exist and that he would need to create God with his own hands and starts working with Miang. The name Krelian is a mistransliteration from Japanese for \\"Karellen\\", referencing an overlord character from Arthur C. Clarke's novel Childhood's End. He is the villain with more development in the game, playing a crucial role in the Solaris war and after. Miang ' is the main antagonist and the mastermind behind all the events in the Xenogears' timeline. She appears repeatedly throughout the game's events in opposition to the party, both behind the scenes and in direct confrontations, Miang acts as representative of Deus, an intergalactic bioweapon designed to conduct warfare on a planetary scale. The final moments of the Eldridge catastrophe resulted in the creation of the original 'mother' being, tasked by the Deus system to give birth to an entire civilization that would provide and gather all the biological and mechanical \\"spare parts\\" it needed to repair and reactivate. Hawwa is the Arabic name of Eve. Myyah (the official romanization according to Perfect Works) is almost the reverse of Elly's full name (Elhaym), with the omitted 'El' being Hebrew and meaning 'God', symbolizing how she is connected to but different from that character. One of the few humans that Deus gave birth to, Miang's first incarnation was known as Hawwa, The Complement. Hawwa's purpose was to guide and shape the events of human history to better suit the coming resurrection of Deus. All human women descended from the crash of the Eldridge, all inhabiting the planet the game takes place on, possess the genetic factor necessary to become the next incarnation of Miang. When the current one dies, Miang simply awakens in a new body. The target seems to be randomly selected, but she always inhabits the body of an adult female, and the momentary transformation always results in purple hair and eye color. The only notable superhuman abilities she possesses are the ability to retain memory across incarnations and some considerable psionic abilities, strong enough to cleanly \\"reprogram\\" someone's subconscious to perform a chosen task, though for the most part she prefers working in the shadows to manipulate world events. This is evidenced by her sparse participation in battles in a mostly supportive role, usually piloting her C-1 Vierge. TIMELINE OF KNOWN AWAKENINGS Eldridge catastrophe - 10,000 years prior to game Deus activated biological computer Kadomony, generating the first mother being in response to Abel's contact with the Wave Existence shortly before planetfall. This original being emerges from the wreckage and gives birth to Miang, Elly, Cain and the Gazel Ministry, then returned to Kadomony's stasis pod where she slowly rots over the next several thousand years. Miang begins her mission to supplement Deus' plans. Zeboim era - 4,000 years prior to game Miang awakens in a pair of identical twin sisters, using their connection to her advantage to conduct espionage within the Zeboim government. Upon finding out that a nano-engineer named Kim is working on a way to repair the genetic breakdown causing infertility in the vast majority of Zeboim citizens, she commissions Kim to continue his work. However, when he moves to secure his creation for himself she sends an assault team to requisition it and kill anyone in their way.Elly:...I just can't... hand our child... over to you... ...Live...! She influences events to accelerate the death of the civilization so that humanity can 'reset' to a form more desirable for Deus, resulting in nuclear annihilation of the entire Zeboim civilization, which then sinks to the bottom of the Aquvy sea. The beginning of the end - approx. 20‚Äì12 years prior to game Unable to locate the current incarnation of the -Contact-, Miang cooperates with Krelian to clone an artificial -Contact- using Emperor Cain's DNA. The clone, which would later become Kahran Ramsus, gains awareness before even being born and develops an inferiority complex soon thereafter.Krelian:Huh? Oh... Recognition code 0808191-'Ramses'. The Emperor's been told it's a prototype for an artificial 'Contact'. Karen:What's its status? Krelian:It has entered the so-called first growth stage. From now until the binding, its growth will be several times faster than that of an ordinary human. But its psychological development will be a little difficult to control... Miang dies of old age, and awakens in Karen Wong, Fei Fong Wong's mother, and uses her new position to conduct battery after battery of torturous experiments on Fei while his father is away, resulting in the inadvertent creation of Id. Miang stands by passively while Grahf attacks Khan Wong, triggering a spontaneous release of Fei's power. Karen regains control momentarily, long enough to throw herself in front of her son to save his life, and is mortally wounded in the process. Fei recedes into the \\"coward\\" personality, shielding himself by displacing the tragedy and horror of these events onto his alter-ego, Id, who remains the dominant personality for the rest of his teenage years under Grahf's destructive tutelage. Miang reawakens in a new host body, apparently in her early twenties, and begins to court Kahran Ramsus in order to gain power within the Gebler faction on Solaris. Final Chapter Miang is cut down by Ramsus in front of the newly activated Deus. The party witnesses her reawakening in Elly, who explains humanity's purpose relative to Deus shortly before being absorbed into its core. Deus utilizes its newly acquired Anima Relics and Krelian's nanotechnology to ascend to a higher, more advanced form than its original design was capable of, and climbs into orbit in an attempt to resume its journey. Fei gives pursuit in the Xenogears, the only Gear left operational after the destruction of the Zohar Modifier, and battles with Miang in her final incarnation, that of the Urobolus. After Fei had successfully defeated her in this form, she had then ceased to exist. Once Miang is eradicated for good, Krelian is convinced of Fei's point of view and resigns from his original mission, opting instead to walk the Path of Sephirot and travel to the higher dimension from which the Wave Existence originated, leaving Fei and Elly to return to the planet in the Xenogears.Krelian: Always the peacemaker, eh Lacan? But, regardless, I cannot go. It is something I have already decided. I'm going to walk with god, even if there is no place left for me upon my return. The chains of fate are broken, and Fei and Elly become the final incarnations of their eternally returning personas, with the memories and experiences of all their past selves incorporated into them. Other characters Emperor Cain ' is the ruler of Solaris. Created along with the Gazel Ministry and Miang, his role was to also serve in the resurrection of Deus. When Abel and Elly fight against Cain's plans for resurrecting Deus, it was Cain that plotted the death of Abel, an allusion to Original sin. Although he is supposed to aid Deus, as a leader of Solaris, Cain actually believes in making the lives of the humans better. He becomes at odds with the Gazel Ministry when they want to use the Gaetia Key and is eventually assassinated by Ramsus under Krelian's orders.Gazel Blue 2':So... Cain is dead? Gazel Red 2:Yes. Gazel Red 2:If only he had just accepted our logical ideas too... Gazel Blue 1:A fitting end for someone who had become dominated by needless flesh. Excellent work, Krelian. Gazel Blue 3:Now there is nothing that can stand in the way of us accomplishing our objective. There are scenes throughout the game exposing the backstory through dialogue between Cain and Citan. Margie Fatima ', nicknamed ', is the current Holy Mother of Nisan, the position once held by Sophia. She is both Bart's first cousin and his fianc√©e, as they are both the only living members of the Fatima royal family. She has a calm, endearing nature, despite her duties. Hammer ' is a rat demi-human who meets Fei in Kislev's D Block Prison. During the Kislev scenario, Hammer presents himself as a shifty, though somewhat reliable mechanic, item seller, and intelligence gatherer. Hammer seems to be well known throughout Kislev, as he is able to freely roam on his own accord, despite being a prisoner. Hammer tags along with the group as they steal the Goliath plane, but is separated from them following an encounter with Grahf. Much later on in the story, Hammer resurfaces after apparently encountering Krelian at some point and being given a new cyborg body. He explains to the party that he had originally been sent to spy on them, but in the end he had refused to cooperate. He then asks the party to destroy him as he has only a limited amount of control over his new body and he doesn't want to continue being Krelian's puppet. He then proceeds to sabotage his own gear while the party takes him down. The Elements The elite of the elite among Solaris' military, a four-member team with each representing one of four elements (earth, water, wind, fire). In the past, the group was Ramsus, Citan, Jesse and Sigurd, major and minor players in the game, however, in the present, it is composed of four young women, each named after an order of angels. They currently work directly under Ramsus, and encounter the party several times in the adventure. ', the Element of Earth, leads the team and is the only member with a surname. She is a vicious, domineering woman. Dominia was molded into the soldier she is after becoming the sole survivor of the events at Elru, a country destroyed by war, and Id in particular. She has numerous altercations with Elly in particular, mocking her for her noble origins. While being the Element of Earth, Dominia actually infuses any of the four elements into her blade, she is the only Element to do this, as the others exclusively use their own element. Dominia pilots a sword-wielding gear called Bladegash. Kelvena () is the Element of Water, and the opposite of Domina, she is calm and cool. Kelvena once even apologizes to Elly for Dominia's harshness, despite being on opposing sides. Kelvena pilots an aquatic gear called Marinebasher. In-game dialogue pictures of Kelvena often show her with her eyes closed, implying she may have been blind, but in reality, Kelvena's innate ether power is so great, she must exert a considerable amount of concentration to keep it under control. Tolone () is the Element of Wind. She is the only one who is a cyborg, as she makes a reference to her \\"positronic photon brain\\", and typically serious and humorless. Tolone pilots a bird-like gear called Skyghene. ' is the Element of Fire, and a foil to Dominia and Tolone's rigidity, as she acts like a complete bimbo. She pilots a gear called Grandgrowl, which resembles a lion. In the final encounter vs the Elements, they combine their four gears into a super- gear. Wave Existence Existing in the Zohar, the ' was present during the events of the Eldridge. The Zohar was an energy source for Deus, While attempting to explore infinite energy phenomena, the Zohar tapped into a higher dimension and pulled the Existence to this dimension, becoming a source of infinite energy for Deus. The Existence is the source of the higher dimension, of which a small portion spilled into this dimension, making the Existence the true God of the Xenogears universe. Its only wish is to be free of the 'prison' which holds it, the Zohar, and to return to Its own dimension. The Wave Existence makes contact with Abel, Fei's ancestor, aboard the Eldridge, allowing Abel to safely land on the planet with Deus. The Wave Existence also creates Elly as a companion for Abel and gives them both the power to be reincarnated throughout history in order to defeat Deus. It wants to be free from Deus and when Fei defeats Deus, the Wave Existence is freed. Wiseman Often appearing to Fei to help him, ' is secretly a personality inside of his father, . Wiseman forms inside of Khan when Grahf enters Khan's body after Khan defeated Grahf ten years prior to the game's start. Wiseman's appearance inside Khan occurred to balance out Grahf's destructive persona. Wiseman brought Fei to Lahan to hide him from Grahf. Queen Zephyr ' is the ruler of Shevat, after the rest of the royal family was killed five hundred years prior to the start of the game in the rebellion against Solaris. She relies on Wiseman to keep her informed of events outside Shevat. Her top advisors are the Gurus , and . Reception The characters of Xenogears have been well received, the lead protagonist Fei in particular, who has been called videogames' \\"most complicated Freudian hero.\\" The staff of Edge felt that Fei's deep backstory and character in general was \\"a far cry from the simplistic two-dimensional leads of Square‚Äôs Super Nintendo RPGs of just a few years earlier.\\" Edge also pointed out the NPCs present during the beginning scenes and how they bring depth to the scenario. \\"As a player, you feel awkward and ashamed in the presence of these NPCs, a guilty confusion and helplessness which perfectly mirrors that felt by your character and justifies his immediate exile\\", the staff wrote. IGN praised both the characters themselves and their designs. In a review for the game at Pulpfilm.com, attention is paid to the secondary characters, who, as the reviewer explains, have \\"profoundly interesting backstories\\", but are never adequately resolved by the end of the game, which other reviews also note. An article from Electronic Gaming Monthly titled WTFiction!? listed Xenogears as one of the \\"wackiest game plotlines ever.\\" Jeremey Parish went on to write that many characters in the game only made the plot more confusing, including Chu-Chu and Grahf. The in-game character sprites have met less praise. A GameSpot reviewer stated that the \\"game's character sprites are poorly animated and suffer from terrible pixelation, no doubt due to the PlayStation's limited RAM.\\" Other critics disagree, arguing that the characters are more realistic than the characters from Final Fantasy VII. In a preview of the game, IGN compared the character sprites to those of Parasite Eve, saying that \\"the game's designers have opted for a more traditional, anime-style look. But this doesn't mean the pint-size characters or low-detail environments of RPGs gone by.\\" Notes References * External links *Characters of Xenogears Official North American Website Xenogears Xenogears ","title":"Characters of Xenogears"},{"id":"19147634","text":"Himes is a surname.

The Estate was formerly the home of the poet and patron of the arts Edward James. He was an avid admirer of the Surrealist movement, and formed one of the largest collections of their works during his lifetime. He inherited West Dean House and the estate after the death of his father, William Dodge James. In 1939 Edward wrote to Aldous Huxley, expressing his fear that after the war, certain arts, particularly the techniques of the craftsmen, would be lost. As a solution, James suggested that his Estate be set up as an educational community where the techniques of craftsmanship could be preserved and taught, whilst restoring old work and creating new art works. In 1964 James conveyed this Estate including West Dean House to the Edward James Foundation; in 1971 the Foundation established West Dean College as a centre for the study of conservation, arts, crafts, writing, gardening and music, providing both full-time and short courses. The Sussex Barn Gallery, Tapestry Studio and West Dean Gardens are also located on the Estate.  Short Courses  The College offers over 700 short courses a year, at various levels of experience and covering a wide range of subjects.  Diplomas, FdAs and MAs  The book conservation workshop West Dean offers MA Degree and Diplomas programmes in Conservation Studies, Visual Arts and Foundation Degree (FdA) in Historic Craft Practices, validated by the University of Sussex. The Conservation MA and Diploma can have a specialty in Conservation of Book and Library Materials, Ceramics and Related Materials, Clocks, Furniture and Related Objects and Metalwork. The Visual Arts MA and Diploma is in Visual Arts, Painting and Drawing, Sculpture or Tapestry and Textile Art. Graduates include artists Pippa Blake and Tim Kent, who have gone on to exhibit their work in a variety of galleries. The College also offers Diploma courses in Making Stringed Musical Instruments.  Tapestry Studio  The West Dean Tapestry Studio was established in 1974 to provide high-level craft-based programmes in woven tapestry, one of only a very small number of such studios worldwide. Their first major commission were The Henry Moore Tapestries. Tapestries woven by the studio are in the Palace of Westminster, Great Ormond Street Hospital and Chelmsford Cathedral. As well as new designs, the Studio is also engaged in recreating the 16th-century 'The Hunt of the Unicorn' tapestries, part of a twelve-year project for Historic Scotland, for the refurbishment of Stirling Castle. The Studio wove a tapestry for Tracey Emin based on her Black Cat painting; it was shown at the Saatchi Gallery in May 2011.  Gallery  The Gallery on the West Dean Estate holds exhibitions of work by major outside artists as well as students and Tutors of West Dean College. Previous exhibitions include sculptor Phillip Jackson‚Äôs ‚ÄòSacred and Profane‚Äô in 2005, Man Ray‚Äôs ‚Äòlight and image‚Äô in 2005 and Brazilian artist Ana Maria Pacheco‚Äôs ‚Äòsome exercise of power‚Äô in 2006.

The area around Northwich has been exploited for its salt pans since this time. The town has been severely affected by salt mining with subsidence historically being a large issue. A programme of mine stabilisation has recently been undertaken. Northwich is a wich town in Cheshire, England. It lies in the heart of the Cheshire Plain, at the confluence of the River Weaver and the River Dane. The town is approximately east of Chester and south of Warrington.  Roman Northwich  The first references to Northwich are during Roman times when the town was known as Condate, thought to be a Latinized form of a Brittonic name meaning \\"Confluence\\". There are several other places by this name, mostly in France; in Northwich's case, it lies near the junction of the rivers Dane and Weaver. Northwich can be identified through two contemporary Roman documents. The first of these is the Antonine Itinerary, a 3rd-century road map split into fourteen sections. Itinerary II is called \\"the route from the Vallum to the port of Rutupiae\\". It describes the route between Hadrian's Wall in northern England and Richborough on the Kent coast. The station Condate is listed 18 miles from Mamucium (now Manchester) and 20 miles from Deva Victrix (now Chester). Itinerary X is called \\"the route from Glannoventa to Mediolanum\\" and details the route between Ravenglass fort, Cumbria and Mediolanum (now Whitchurch, Shropshire). In this description Condate is described as 19 miles before the routes end at Whitchurch and, again, as 18 miles from Manchester. The second document is the 7th century Ravenna Cosmography. Again this document refers to Condate between the entries for Salinae (now Middlewich, Cheshire) and Ratae (now Leicester, Leicestershire), at the time the capital of the Corieltauvi tribe. The Roman's interest in the Northwich area is thought to be due to the strategic river crossing and the location of the salt brines. Salt was very important in Roman society. The Roman word salarium, linked employment, salt and soldiers, but the exact link is unclear. It is also theorised that this is the basis for the modern word salary. Another theory is that the word soldier itself comes from the Latin sal dare (to give salt). See History of salt for further details. There is archaeological evidence of a Roman auxiliary fort within the area of Northwich now known as \\"Castle\\" dated to 70 AD. This and other North West forts were built as the Romans moved north from their stronghold in Chester. The fort was located on the west bank of the River Weaver. The fort has been excavated from 1983 onwards and shows two periods of military occupation. The first began around AD 70 and the second finished around AD 140\\\\. The fort was smaller during its second occupation. Excavations discovered the remains of barrack blocks and courtyard building thought to be a Praetorium, or commandant's house. The Romans used lead salt pans to extract the salt from the brine. Salt pans and 1st-century brine kilns have all been found around the Roman fort.  Medieval  The association with salt continues in the etymology of Northwich. The \\"wich\\" (or wych) suffix applies to other towns in the area - namely Middlewich, Nantwich and Leftwich. This is considered to have been derived from the Norse, \\"wic\\", for bay and is associated with the more traditional method of obtaining salt from evaporating sea water. Therefore, a place for making salt became a wych-house; and Northwich was the most northern of the Wich towns in Cheshire. The existence of Northwich in the early medieval period is shown by its record in the Domesday Book: It shows that by 1086 the town was producing salt and was valued the same as Middlewich at ¬£8, although less than the ¬£21 value given to Nantwich. It is unclear if salt extraction had continued from the Roman to Medieval periods. The manor of Northwich belonged to the Earls of Chester. However, in 1237 the family line died out. Subsequently, Northwich became a royal manor and was given to a noble family to collect tolls in exchange for a set rent. By 1484 this family was the Stanley's, later Earls of Derby and stayed in the family's hands until the late 18th century. That salt production continued throughout the centuries can be seen through John Leland's description of the town in 1540: Although Leland described Northwich as a market town, there is no surviving charter for a market or fair. A market still exists today. Between 1642 and 1643, during the English Civil War, Northwich was fortified and garrisoned by Sir William Bereton for the Parliamentarians.  Salt rediscovered  The salt beds beneath Northwich were re-discovered in the 1670s by employees of the local Smith-Barry family. The Smith-Barrys were looking for coal, but instead discovered rock salt, in the grounds of the family home, Marbury Hall, to the north of Northwich. Soon salt mining started again. This mining area is now known as Dairy House Meadow. By 1732 the River Weaver was improved from Frodsham Bridge to Winsford Bridge and eventually allowed vessels up to to travel up to Northwich Bridge. This allowed salt to be transported by boat rather than cart. The Trent and Mersey Canal, opened in 1775, passed to the north of Northwich because of objections from the trustees of the Weaver Navigation. However, the canal passed salt deposits near the village of Marston, and many of the later salt works were based along its banks including the Lion Salt Works and New Cheshire Salt Works. The Anderton Boat Lift was opened in 1875 to connect the canal and river systems. Weaver Hall Museum, previously the workhouse An important development occurred when it became uneconomical to mine for the salt. Instead hot water was pumped through the mines, which dissolved the salt. The resultant brine was pumped out and the salt extracted from the brine. This technique weakened the mines and led to land subsidence as they collapsed. Subsidence affected the town and the surrounding landscape. For example, collapses in 1880 formed Witton Flash as the River Weaver flowed into a huge hole caused by subsidence. Subsidence also allegedly accounts for many old timber-framed houses in the town centre, which were better able to withstand the movement of the ground. Some houses were built on a base of steel girders which could be jacked up to level the house with each change in the underlying ground. The town's historical link with the salt industry is celebrated in its Museum which is today located in the town's old workhouse.  Victorian expansion  The 19th century saw major changes for the town. A local board was founded on 26 June 1863 under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1858 to serve the original thirteen acres of the manor of Northwich. In 1875 this merged with its much larger neighbour at Witton cum Twambrooks were amalgamanted, and the resultant area was further extended in 1880 to include the whole of Castle Northwich and parts of Hartford, Winnington and Leftwich. On 10 September 1894 these areas were united as the civil parish of Northwich, served by Northwich Urban District Council.Kelly's Directory of Cheshire (1896), p.409 Further expansion took place in 1936 by the addition of parts of Winnington, Lostock Gralam, Barnton, Leftwich and Rudheath, and again in 1955 when parts of Davenham, Hartford, Rudheath and Whatcroft were added Vision of Britain. Northwich U.D.. Retrieved on 2008-12-24 Railways first came to the town in 1863 when the line from Manchester Central was extended from Knutsford by the Cheshire Midland Railway. An extension to Helsby was completed by the West Cheshire Railway in 1869. Both of these lines became constituents of the Cheshire Lines Committee on 15 August 1867. The line is now marketed as the Mid-Cheshire line.  Chemical industry  Winnington Works In 1874, John Brunner and Ludwig Mond founded Brunner Mond in Winnington and started manufacturing soda ash using the Solvay ammonia-soda process. This process used salt as a main raw material. The chemical industry used the subsided land for the disposal of waste from the manufacture of soda-ash. The waste was transported through a network of cranes and rails to the produce limebeds. This was a dangerous alkaline substance and caused the landscape to be abandoned as unusable. Brunner Mond later amalgamated with three other chemical companies in 1926 to form Imperial Chemical Industries, better known as ICI, which was for many years one of Europe's leading chemical companies in both chemical production and research.  Reclamation  In 1975 Marbury Country Park was the first area to be reclaimed from dereliction and has become a popular recreational area. In 1987 more land was reclaimed to form Furey Wood and over later years, Cheshire County Council's Land Regeneration Unit reclaimed what is now known as Anderton Nature Park, Witton Flash, Dairy House Meadows, Witton Mill Meadows, and Ashton's and Neumann's Flashes. Much of the funding for the creation of these public areas has been supplied from the North West Development Agency and now extends to approximately 323 hectares of public space known as Northwich Community Woodlands.  Salt mine stabilisation  In February 2004 a ¬£28 million programme to stabilise the abandoned salt mines underneath Northwich was begun. The work was funded by the English Partnerships through its Land Stabilisation Programme, introduced to resolve issues associated with unstable mines around England. The four mines identified for work were Baron's Quay, Witton Bank, Neumann's and Penny's Lane. These mines were chosen because their subsidence was causing problems for the town centre. When they were abandoned the mines were left with supporting salt pillars. Modern salt mining leaves around 30% of the salt to form the pillars but, because of the wild-brine pumping, the 19th century mines under Northwich were left with sometimes only 5% of the salt to form the pillars which has since been found to be inadequate. To provide additional support in the 1920s brine was used to flood the mines. However ground movement has been detected and has effectively ceased development in Northwich town centre. The current stabilisation plan involves removing millions of litres of brine from the four mines and replacing it with a mixture of pulverised fuel ash (PFA), cement and salt. The PFA arrives by rail; the cement and salt by road. The grout is mixed at Brunner Mond, Winnington from where it is pumped via a pipeline into the mines through a series of boreholes around the town. The removed brine is pumped in the opposite direction to Winnington and then taken by train to British Salt in Middlewich. Here the brine is put to use in many products such as water softeners and road de- icers. The project was completed in late 2007. Future Following the stabilisation of the mines, Northwich is to be developed in line with the 'Vision for Northwich'. The vision, if completed, will see the old concrete County Council buildings and Magistrates Court demolished and replaced with more modern buildings. New housing developments continue to appear around Northwich. In 2002 the Drill Field, the world's oldest football ground, was demolished and has been replaced by housing as Northwich Victoria football club sold the ground to relieve debt. A Debenhams store is planned to be built at Barons Quay along with a cinema and 40 new shops.

Written by Glen and Les Charles and directed by James Burrows, the episode first aired September 30, 1982 on NBC. The pilot episode introduces the employees of bar Cheers: Sam Malone, Diane Chambers, Coach Ernie Pantusso, and Carla Tortelli; and regular customers Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin. In this episode, Diane, brought in by fianc√© Sumner Sloan, meets the employees and patrons of the bar. When she realizes that her fianc√© has left her alone in the bar, Diane accepts Sam's offer to be the bar's waitress to start over. In the original script the employees were the principal characters, and Norm and Cliff were not included. Later revisions added Norm and Cliff, and scenes were restructured and rewritten. Originally, Cheers set would be a hotel, but it was ultimately changed to a bar. Ratings were low when the episode first aired, but were moderately successful in reruns. It has been critically praised over the years, and earned its writers awards for Best Writing in 1983. Plot As owner Sam Malone opens the Cheers bar, a professor Sumner Sloane (Michael McGuire) and his Boston University student fianc√©e Diane Chambers are the first customers. They are planning to go to Barbados to be married, but do not have a wedding ring; Sumner leaves to get the ring from his ex-wife. While she waits, Diane learns about the other people in the bar. Sam is an ex-baseball player and a recovering alcoholic. Waitress Carla Tortelli is a bitter divorc√©e with four children. Male patrons are playing a \\"body sweat in movies\\" trivia game, which repulses Diane. Sumner returns a few hours later, suggesting Cool Hand Luke as a \\"sweaty\\" movie and telling Diane he could not get his ex-wife's ring. His ex-wife calls the bar with a change of heart, and Sumner leaves Diane again. Diane and Sam argue about Sumner, and Sam pointedly tells her Sumner is probably on a plane with his ex-wife. Diane calls the airport to change their flight reservation, and finds out that \\"Mr. and Mrs. Sloane\\" have already used it. Heartbroken, she prepares to go home before realizing that her job as Sumner's teaching assistant is gone. Out of pity, Sam offers her a job at Cheers as a waitress. Because of her educational background, Diane initially refuses; however, when she remembers a number of orders (including special requests) from a table she reluctantly accepts the job. The following day, Diane's first customer is an international tourist (Erik Holland), asking for his lost luggage.  Casting  The pilot introduces employees of the bar, Cheers, in Boston, Massachusetts in order of appearance: * Sam Malone (Ted Danson) is a recovering alcoholic, a former baseball player, a bartender and the owner of Cheers. * Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) is a graduate student and \\"bar misfit\\" who is abandoned by her fianc√©, Sumner Sloane. She becomes a waitress at the end of the episode. * Ernie Pantusso (Nicholas Colasanto) is a \\"forgetful\\", \\"gravelly-voiced bartender\\", nicknamed \\"Coach\\" because he was Sam's coach during his career as a relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox. * Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) is a bitter, \\"wisecracking, cynical waitress\\" and divorc√©e whose husband, Nick,Nick Tortelli first appears onscreen in Season 2 episode \\"Battle of the Exes\\" (1984), and is portrayed by Dan Hedaya. abandons her and her four children. The creators rejected the idea of casting a star such as Mary Tyler Moore, and sought actors who were previously unknown to the public. They interviewed almost 1,000 people for the four principal roles: Sam Malone, Diane Chambers, Carla Tortelli, and \\"Coach\\" Ernie Pantusso. Steve Kolzak (credited as Stephen Kolzak)Bjorklund, p. 281 cast the original characters. According to Danson, Rhea Perlman was the first to be cast. Former umpire Ron Luciano auditioned for Coach; however, the producers \\"wanted an experienced actor\\". Robert Prosky, who later appeared as Rebecca Howe's (Kirstie Alley) Navy father in the 1992 Cheers episode \\"Daddy's Little Middle-Aged Girl\\" and an author in the 1996 Frasier episode \\"A Crane's Critique\\", turned down the role of Coach.Rozen, Leah. \\"The Stage Is His Usual Beat, but Robert Prosky Copped a Prime-Time Job as Hill Street's New Sarge.\\" People October 22, 1984. Web. April 6, 2012. Actor-director Nicholas Colasanto won the role. Auditions were held for Sam and Diane. Three pairs were tested: William Devane and Lisa Eichhorn, Fred Dryer and Julia Duffy, and Ted Danson and Shelley Long. Editions of April 27-29, 1984, are bundled in the webpage. Article is located at page 85 in Google. Before the show premiered Danson appeared in 1979's The Onion Field; Distributed in The Prescott Courier along with other newspapers. Long appeared in 1982's Night Shift, starring Henry Winkler of Happy Days. Fred Dryer later appeared as Dave Richards, a sportscaster friend of Sam's, in \\"Sam at Eleven\\" in 1982.Bjorklund e-Book, \\"Season One: 1982‚Äì83\\", p. 284. Sam Malone was originally \\"a former wide receiver for the New England Patriots\\", and Fred Dryer was considered for the role because he was a football player. However, NBC executives liked test scenes with Danson and Long so the creators chose them instead, making Sam a former relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox. Ed O'Neill also auditioned for the role of Sam Malone. Two customers were introduced: * Norm Peterson (George Wendt), recognized by everyone in the bar, enters for a quick drink. * Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) appears for a conversation with other male patrons about bar trivia.Actor John Ratzenberger appears as Cliff Clavin and is always credited in the closing credits of every episode of Season 1, including this episode, instead of opening. Moreover, Norm and Cliff were not established as \\"best friends\\" until Season 2. George Wendt and John Ratzenberger originally auditioned for the role of \\"George\\", and Wendt was cast.Wendt, p. 112.Wendt, pp. 113-114\\\\. John Ratzenberger auditioned for the role George, as well. In the original script, George was Diane's first customer at the end of the episode. Annoyed with Diane's long- winded explanation of how she became a waitress, he delivered his one-word line: \\"Beer!\\" After Wendt was cast, the writers revised the script; his role evolved into Norm Peterson, the first onscreen customer to enter the bar and \\"[badgering] Diane rather than the other way around\\".Wendt, p. 113. After Wendt was cast, Ratzenberger suggested to the producers that a know-it-all character be added; this led to the creation of another character, Cliff Clavin. One character who was cut from the pilot episode was an unpleasant, racist, wheelchair-bound old woman named Mrs. Littlefield, supposedly a regular customer of Cheers, who was intended to be a recurring character. Her lines were filmed as part of a rough cut of the pilot. However, the producers decided to cut the character out of the episode, as they found her character did not mesh with other characters or with the overall tone of the show. Nevertheless, the uncredited actress who played her can still be seen as a background performer in a few scenes. Some sources credit this actress as Elaine Strich, although the unidentified actress who is still seen on camera looks nothing like Stritch. In answer to a question about the actress, Cheers writer/producer Ken Levine has stated on his blog \\"that was not Elaine Stritch\\"http://kenlevine.blogspot.ca/2016/04/friday-questions_29.html According to the episode's script, the character in question was played by Margaret Wheeler. The producers ultimately decided to eliminate Mrs. Littlefield completely from the show from that point forward, necessitating changes to some yet-to-be-filmed scripts for the first few episodes.Levine, Ken (January 3, 2014). \\"Friday Questions\\". BlogSpot. Retrieved February 9, 2015. Three other bar patrons have speaking roles in the completed episode: John P. Navin, Jr. portrays a teenage boy in the cold open, Erik Holland has a brief bit as Diane's first customer, and Ron Frazier appears as a barfly who stands at the bar near Cliff (and who offers \\"Ben Hur\\" as his choice for the sweatiest movie ever made.)  Production  The creators of Cheers (and the crew of Taxi), co-writers Glen and Les Charles and director James Burrows, created a sitcom project in 1981. Initially set in a hotel, the setting changed to a hotel bar and finally a \\"Boston neighborhood bar\\". The show was filmed not in a pub, but on Stage 25 of the Paramount Studios lot. Cheers set was inspired by the Bull & Finch Pub in Boston, ProQuest: . now known as Cheers Beacon Hill (pictured, right). Google News. A Boston bar was chosen because of its \\"interior [made out of] brick, polished mahogany, and brass\\"; the city was chosen because it is \\"cosmopolitan\\", \\"a great sports town\\" and was not previously explored on television. Because the creators are sports fans, an athletic element was added to the bar. Editions of April 27-29, 1984, are bundled in the webpage. Article is located at page 85 in Google. Burrows said that the show was intended to be about a bar which people visit for more than drinks. Jokes from earlier scripts were used. In one scene, Carla Tortelli orders a phone caller to do something about their unruly children. When one of the bartenders suggests hiring a babysitter, Carla replied that the caller was the babysitter. The cast did not know the ending of the pilot episode during production, since the final draft of the script was dated April 16, 1982.  Reception   Ratings  The NBC premiere lineup on September 30, 1982 consisted of (beginning at 8:00 pm Eastern and Pacific Time) Fame, Cheers, Taxi and Hill Street Blues. Cheers debuted at 9:00 pm against the two- hour season premiere of Magnum, P.I. and the one-hour season premiere of Too Close for Comfort.

December 30, 1982, Library ed. Print. Part VI (Calendar Section), p. 10.  Critical reaction  When the episode originally aired in 1982, Fred Rothenberg of the Associated Press called it an introduction to a \\"new wise- cracking comedy\\", \\"a warm and wacky companion of a television show, a delightful place to spend idle time, [and] a five-star watering hole\\" known as Cheers. Television and radio critic Mike Drew said it was not great but \\"funnier [...] with cute lines [...] than\\" any other sitcom, even those (like Archie Bunker's Place on TV and Duffy's Tavern on radio) set in bars. Fred L. Smith of The News and Courier found this episode similar to Taxi: \\"Both are set in a place of business‚àíCheers at a [Boston bar], Taxi at a [New York taxi company]‚Äîboth have a sensible guy and a pretty, preppy girl as main characters‚ÄîTed Danson and Shelley Long in Cheers and Judd Hirsch and Marilu Henner in Taxi‚Äîand both are wacky comedies.\\" He found it \\"amusing\\"; some jokes, funny; many others, forced; and the number of \\"weird characters\\" in the show greater than their real-life bar counterparts. In 2009, Lex Walker on the Just Press Play website found this episode \\"sadder and more sentimental\\" than funny; the episode focuses \\"less on character development and more on\\" Diane restarting her life as a waitress after the loss of love, and he said it contradicts \\"what [Cheers] will grow to be\\". Nevertheless, he called the episode a true introduction to the series and considered the intertwining stories of Sam and his friends the series' premise. In 2010, Robin Raven from Yahoo! Voices called it one of her top five Cheers episodes. In 2011, Austin Lugar from The Film Yap website called it the \\"best\\". IGN ranked it number nine of the top ten Cheers episodes. Joseph J. and Kate Darowski in their 2019 book Cheers: A Cultural History rated the episode all four stars.  Awards  At the 1983 Primetime Emmy Awards, writers and co-creators Glen and Les Charles won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series for this episode. The brothers also received a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay - Episodic Comedy. The episode earned production designer Richard Sylbert and set decorator George Gaines an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Art Direction for a Series (won by Tales of the Gold Monkey). \\"Give Me A Ring Sometime\\" was Shelley Long's winning submission for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.  Home media  The first home media release of the episode was a VHS cassette in the United States on September 29, 1993. It was part of the initial launch of seven cassettes by Paramount Home Video. One volume contained only the pilot episode itself, while each of other six volumes contained two episodes. Record number MERLIN_107903 from NewsBank. The episode was released on Region 1 DVD as part of the season one box on May 20, 2003, and as part of Fan Favorites: The Best of Cheers on March 6, 2012.

Also shown is the radial density, 4œÄr2œÅ(r), scaled by a factor of 0.0375. In quantum chemistry, the electron localization function (ELF) is a measure of the likelihood of finding an electron in the neighborhood space of a reference electron located at a given point and with the same spin. Physically, this measures the extent of spatial localization of the reference electron and provides a method for the mapping of electron pair probability in multielectronic systems. ELF's usefulness stems from the observation that it allows electron localization to be analyzed in a chemically intuitive way. For example, the shell structure of heavy atoms is obvious when plotting ELF against the radial distance from the nucleus; the ELF for radon, for example, has six clear maxima, whereas the electronic density decreases monotonically and the radially weighted density fails to show all shells. When applied to molecules, and analysis of the ELF shows a clear separation between the core and valence electron, and also shows covalent bonds and lone pairs, in what has been called \\"a faithful visualization of VSEPR theory in action\\". Another feature of the ELF is that it is invariant concerning the transformation of the molecular orbitals. Image of the ELF of water at level 0.8, generated using PyMOL The ELF was originally defined by Becke and Edgecombe in 1990. They first argued that a measure of the electron localization is provided by :D_\\\\sigma(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\tau_\\\\sigma(\\\\mathbf{r}) - \\\\tfrac{1}{4} \\\\frac{( abla\\\\rho_\\\\sigma(\\\\mathbf{r}))^2}{\\\\rho_\\\\sigma(\\\\mathbf{r})}, where œÅ is the electron spin density and œÑ the kinetic energy density. The second term (negative term) is the bosonic kinetic energy density, so D is the contribution due to fermions. D is expected to be small in those regions of space where localized electrons are to be found. Given the arbitrariness of the magnitude of the localization measure provided by D, it is compared to the corresponding value for a uniform electron gas with spin density equal to œÅ(r), which is given by :D^0_\\\\sigma(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\tfrac{3}{5}(6 \\\\pi^2)^{2/3} \\\\rho^{5/3}_\\\\sigma(\\\\mathbf{r}). The ratio, :\\\\chi_\\\\sigma(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\frac{D_\\\\sigma(\\\\mathbf{r})}{D^0_\\\\sigma(\\\\mathbf{r})}, is a dimensionless localization index that expresses electron localization for the uniform electron gas. In the final step, the ELF is defined in terms of œá by mapping its values on to the range 0 ‚â§ ELF ‚â§ 1 by defining the electron localization function as :\\\\mathrm{ELF}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\chi^2_\\\\sigma(\\\\mathbf{r})}. ELF = 1 corresponding to perfect localization and ELF = ¬Ω corresponding to the electron gas. The original derivation was based on Hartree‚ÄìFock theory. For density functional theory, the approach was generalized by Savin in 1992. The approach of electron localization, in the form of atoms in molecules (AIM), was pioneered by Bader. Bader's analysis partitions the charge density in a molecule to \\"atoms\\" according to zero-flux surfaces (surfaces across which no electron flow is taking place). Bader's analysis allows many properties such as multipole moments, energies and forces, to be partitioned in a defensible and consistent manner to individual atoms within molecules. Both the Bader approach and the ELF approach to partitioning of molecular properties have gained popularity in recent years because the fastest, accurate ab-initio calculations of molecular properties are now mostly made using density functional theory (DFT), which directly calculates the electron density. This electron density is then analyzed using the Bader charge analysis of Electron Localization Functions. One of the most popular functionals in DFT was first proposed by Becke, who also originated Electron Localization Functions. References External links *Frank R. Wagner (ed.)

Facing powerful state and international conservation interests, they rarely have legal recourse. Many conservation refugees are housed in refugee camps. Role of ENGOs ENGOs (environmental non-governmental organizations) are funded by a variety of sources. Private foundations, such as the Ford and MacArthur Foundations, once provided the bulk of the funds supporting NGO conservation efforts. Funds from bilateral and multilateral sources (such as USAID and the World Bank) and corporations also support ENGOs. An increase in corporate sponsorship raises the possibility of a conflict of interest between ENGOs and the corporations which support them, leading to ethical negligence. Although the websites of the World Wildlife Fund, The Nature Conservancy and Conservation International say that the groups participate with local communities, the universally-applied model of conservation (based on Western science) often clashes with traditional knowledge of the environment. The Western conservation movement may be dismissive of indigenous conservation models because they are not based on Western science, but indigenous knowledge is the result of generations of interaction with their environment. In his Orion magazine article \\"Conservation Refugees\\", Mark Dowie writes: > \\"John Muir, a forefather of the American conservation movement, argued that > 'wilderness' should be cleared of all inhabitants and set aside to satisfy > the urbane human's need for recreation and spiritual renewal. It was a > sentiment that became national policy with the passage of the 1964 > Wilderness Act, which defined wilderness as a place 'where man himself is a > visitor who does not remain.' One should not be surprised to find hardy > residues of these sentiments among traditional conservation groups. The > preference for 'virgin' wilderness has lingered on in a movement that has > tended to value all nature but human nature, and refused to recognize the > positive wildness in human beings.\\" Dowie's article assesses the globalization of conservation. With the removal of indigenous communities from protected land, a symbiosis between indigenous peoples and their environment is disrupted; this may have the unintended consequence of decreasing biodiversity, as those who formerly lived off the land are now prohibited from interacting with it. As a result of their expulsion, they are poor additions to the over-populated areas surrounding the park (Igoe 2005). Poaching may increase, and the soil may become degraded as refugees take up subsistence agriculture. By ignoring the human factor, the conservation model followed by large ENGOs can be ineffective and counterproductive. Preserving habitats or cultures In the spring of 2003, India's Adivasi were pushed out of their farmlands and relocated to crowded villages to import six Asiatic lions. Although NGOs such as the World Wildlife Fund try to conserve land and animal species while training indigenous peoples for alternate work, indigenous peoples are often removed from their land and placed in communities or villages which leave them vulnerable to poverty and starvation. Not compensated for what was lost, they have difficulty adjusting to their new lifestyle. Christine MacDonald's Green, Inc. quotes a tribal leader that \\"white men\\" told them to leave their homes in the forest because the land was not protected; they were forced into another village (which was already occupied by another group) outside the forest, and had \\"no choice, because they told them that they [would] be beaten and killed\\". Left without food and land, they were forced to work on farms established by the villagers before them. Eliminating culture and behavior Indigenous peoples who are forced from their land lose the portions of their culture which are embedded in resources. According to Darrell A. Posey, indigenous knowledge could significantly contribute to conservation: \\"What looked natural might be cultural, and thus that indigenous people should be seen as models for conservation, rather than as opposed to it and thus denied land rights\\". Many residents of what have become conservation sites or national parks have cultural rituals and practices which are adapted to their local environment. Through these practices, they have been able to survive and develop a culture. Mark Dowie's Conservation Refugees describes Africa's Batwa Pygmies. After living in conservation camps under restrictions limiting centuries-old cultural practices, community member Kwokwo Barume observed that \\"we are heading toward extinction\\". The restrictions include bans on cultivation, hunting or gathering, and sacred sites and burial grounds are off-limits; all are essential to the people's daily life. Limitations such as these help lead toward the extinction of hunter-gatherer groups around the world to make way for government-sanctioned game reserves and ecotourism. Redefining conservation Posey was an anthropologist and ethnobiologist whose writings about the Kayapo people of the Amazon rainforest influenced environmental policy; traditional societies are now viewed as helpers in conservation, and steps are being taken to aid the reconstruction of these societies (Dove & Carpenter 2008:5). Posey reiterated that indigenous people were the only ones who truly knew the forests, because they inhabited them for centuries. He also determined that biodiversity was important for indigenous peoples' lives through gardens, openings into the forest and rock outcrops; what is considered natural today may have been altered by the ancestors of the indigenous peoples, rather than naturally occurring as previously thought. Posey's work is helping to redefine conservation and what it means to societies living in conservation areas. South American countries connect indigenous groups willing to practice conservation with technical resources from conservation groups. Instead of being expelled from their land, the Federal Environmental Conservation Act that protects their rights to remain on the land and use its natural resources; the \\"commonwealth minister negotiates conservation agreements with them\\".Alcorn, J.B. and A.G. Royo. 2007:13 Indigenous peoples The World Council of Indigenous Peoples (WCIP) held its first conference in British Columbia in 1975. It was founded by Chief George Manuel of the Shuswap Nation, who found after traveling the world that the same suffering and mistreatment felt by the North American Indians were also felt by many other indigenous peoples. Some indigenous peoples began to speak up at conservation meetings which affected them. According to Mark Dowie, the Masai sent leader Martin Saring'O to the November 22, 2004 Bangkok World Conservation Congress meeting (sponsored by the International Union for Conservation of Nature) to defend their land rights: \\"Standing before the congress, he [Martin Sarin'O] expressed, 'we are enemies of conservation.' Their nomadic people have lost most of their grazing lands over the last thirty years. At the meeting, Massai reminds the IUCN, and defends that they were the original conservationists\\". Dowie also writes that Sayyaad Saltani, the elected chair of the Council of Elders of the Qashqai Confederation in Iran, gave a speech to the World Parks Congress in Durban, South Africa in October 2003. Saltani discussed the relentless pressures on his nomadic pastoral people, how their pastures and natural resources were seized by a number of agencies, and the interruption of their migratory path: \\"Their summer and winter pastures were consistently degraded and fragmented by outsiders, and not even their social identity was left alone\\". Violence and retaliation have followed park creation due to resentment of land restriction and displacement or blocked access to resources, causing shortages. In Nepal, when the Sagarmatha National Park was founded, the Sherpa intentionally accelerated forest depletion because their rights and traditional practices had been taken away: \\"Local elders estimated that more forest was lost in the first four years after the park's creation than in the previous two decades\\". Several instances of violence have occurred in India following park creations. India has nearly five hundred protected areas, rich in resources and primarily surrounded by agricultural land and poor villages: \\"Inevitably they invade the reserves and come into conflict with authorities. Resentment at the wildlife authorities attempts to control the situation has exploded in violence against officials and guards\\". In the Naganhde National Park in South India, wildlife guards allegedly killed a poacher; the local people retaliating by burning of forest: \\"In India, resentment by local people to National Parks legislation and enforcement agencies has caused increasing problems\\". Africa African conservation refugees (about 14 million, according to some sources) have long been displaced due to transnational efforts to preserve select biomes believed to be historically and environmentally crucial. The article \\"Parks and Peoples: the social impact of protected areas\\" reported that a protected area is a way of \\"seeing, understanding, and reproducing the world around us\\" and a place of social interaction and production.West, P., Igoe, J., & Brockington, D. (2006, June 5). Parks and People: the social impact of protected areas. Annual Review of Anthropology, pp. 251-77. Protected areas are established to preserve an area in its natural state in an increasingly-globalized world. Although the residential grounds of millions of native people have existed for hundreds of years, conservation efforts encroach on these areas to preserve the biological diversity of flora and fauna. Wildlife, plants and other resources are protected, and native people are expelled beyond the border of the new preserved area (PA) so they do not affect the ecological preservation. Displacement and the lack of rights of displaced peoples is a main concern of environmental conservation; displaced peoples may encounter social problems (such as nationalism) in their new locations. These refugees often become a socially-isolated underclass. Another effect of displacement is the loss of jobs, hunting grounds, personal resources and freedom. The treatment of these peoples may trigger war (among themselves or with opposing groups), disease and malnutrition. Long-term effects of the displacement persist in conservation refugees, their families and subsequent generations, reshaping the cultural and economic dynamics of a society with a ripple effect. Resources are directly linked to conflicts, in Africa as elsewhere; according to Abiodun Alao, author of Natural Resources and Conflict in Africa, natural resources can be linked to conflict in three different ways: a direct (or remote) conflict is caused by the resource, a natural resource can fuel (or sustain conflicts), and resources have been used to resolve conflicts.Alao, A. (2007). Natural Resources and Conflicts in Africa: The Tragedy of Endowment. Rochester, NY: University of Rochester Press. Conservation efforts which appropriate an indigenous people's land remove them from a familiar social environment to unknown quarters and customs; traditional values, such as \\"songs, rituals, ... and stories\\" may be entirely lost in a little over a generation. Relocation may be economically devastating on an individual and group level. Indigenous peoples are forced to the boundaries of the new parks, stripped of their homes and status, and sometimes made to live in \\"shabby squatter camps ... without running water or sanitation\\". To protect the rights of indigenous people and others displaced as conservation refugees, the Fifth World Parks Congress held a session to discuss the problem. The session acknowledged the connection between poverty and displacement, altering land rights and their hazardous effects on culture and future generations. Its Durban Action Plan will insure that local people are compensated financially before an area is acquired for conservation. East Africa East Africa is home to tribes, such as the Maasai, whose livelihood and culture revolve around cattle. The Maasai are pastoralists, whose \\"livestock follow a seasonal settlement in the dry season and disperse into temporary camps in the wet season\\". They once occupied most of the Serengeti-Ngorongoro region; recent archaeological research concluded that pastoralists occupied the region for at least 2,500 years, and the Maasai occupied the area since the mid-nineteenth century.McCabe, J. Terrence 2002 Giving Conservation a Human Face? Lessons From Forty Years of Combining Conservation and Development in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania. In Conservation and Mobile Indigenous Peoples: Displacement, Forced Settlement, and Sustainable Development. Dawn Chatty and Marcus Colchester, eds., pp. 61-76. Berghahn Books Although the Serengeti- Ngorongoro region was allocated for a proposed national park in 1940, the pastoralists were allowed to remain. Ten years later, conflict erupted among the pastoralists, farmers and park authorities who divided the park into the Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA). The division evicted the Maasai pastoralists from the national park, but allowed them to remain in restricted areas of the NCA. This affected the Maasai lifestyle and the environment. During the wet season, the Maasai had herded their cattle to the Serengeti for grazing; after the parks' division, they could only graze in the NCA. The Maasai's seasonal migrations from the Serengeti and the Ngorongoro helped prevent over-grazing; with the new restrictions, over-grazing could result in the starvation of their cattle and the depletion of environmental resources. Another problem for the Maasai was the rapid population increase of the wildebeest. Wildebeest calves are unaffected hosts of bovine malignant catarrhal fever, a viral infection which can kill Maasai livestock exposed to areas grazed by the calves. In addition to disease, the large wildebeest population devoured the grasses which had been grazed by Maasai livestock. During the early 1970s, cultivation was banned in the NCA. The Maasai also depend on grain cultivation, trading livestock for grain. For twenty years, they experienced a ban on cultivation, restrictions on highland craters and the spread of livestock disease. Because of the inability to cultivate, there was an increase in malnutrition increased in Maasai children. The cultivation ban was lifted during the early 1990s, improving Maasai living standards; malnutrition declined, and sustainable living returned. Since intense cultivation is required to support the population, however, conservationists are reconsidering a cultivation ban. In 1988, Tanzania's Department of Wildlife evicted thousands of people from the Mkomazi Game Reserve. The result of the evictions and restrictions to land use, according to Mark Dowie, \\"is a gradual community and cultural meltdown.\\" Neighboring communities have become violent as the result of tension between indigenous people and the parks. Due to overgrazing and restrictions on land use, many pastoralists \\"were forced to reduce or completely sell off their herds and learn to cultivate grains and legumes on small plots of arid land. Some turned to poaching for a living, others prostitution ... young men who sold their herds turned to profligate lives, and when their money ran out they became low-wage farm workers and small-time hustlers. Young women facing a shrinking pool of potential husbands sell community essentials such as charcoal, traditional medicines, milk from borrowed goats, or, saddest of all, themselves\\".Dowie, Mark (2009) Conservation Refugees: The Hundred-Year Conflict between Global Conservation and Native Peoples. Cambridge: MIT Press. Because of the decline in resources and their displacement to non-arable lands, many pastoralists have resorted to bushmeat for subsistence and trade; this threatens the already-declining population of apes, and facilitates the spread of HIV and Ebola virus disease. The Ogiek tribes of the Mau Forest are also the targets of land restrictions and evacuation from their native lands. The Ogiek have been described as a peaceful people who primarily cultivate honey bees, but will grow beans and potatoes if needed. They subsist only on animals who are abundant in the forest;when the tribe notices a decline in population of a particular animal due to hunting, the Ogiek will raise sheep and goats for food. Animals are killed for their use only, and the Ogiek are not part of the bushmeat market. They are considered \\"the best imaginable conservators of land\\". The first attempt to displace the Ogiek people occurred during the 20th century, when British settlers attempted to clear the forest for tea plantations. With the Forest Act of 1957 and the Wildlife Conservation Act of 1977, successive governments have displaced the Ogiek for forest conservation; they were often moved to non-arable land which was useless to their customary lifestyle of bee production and hunting. This displacement made many Ogiek homeless, poor and ill; their life expectancy declined from sixty to forty-six years. Although the High Court of Tanzania halted the evictions in June 2005, its ruling was appealed five months later. The appeal argued that the Ogiek were unfit to inhabit the Mau Forest, ignoring the forest's illegal, massive logging operations. Ecologists and hydrologists now agree with the Ogiek that Kenya's forests (which are beginning to decline) are the main suppliers of water for the nation and, if not preserved, will result is mass starvation. West Africa In Guinea, deforestation has become the environmental norm. Since records began to be kept, only 1.8 percent of the country's tropical moist forest remains. To preserve the remaining forested land, conservationists have protected three swaths of land with restrictions on hunting, farming, and residency. As a result, 663,000 people have been displaced from the protected areas. This trend is reflected in neighboring countries; Liberia claims over 120,000 conservation refugees, and Senegal has 65,000 people displaced from its nine protected areas. Ghana, to the east, has 35,000 refugees from the six percent of its remaining forests in nine protected areas (PAs).Weber, William. African Rain Forest Ecology and Conservation: an Interdisciplinary Perspective. New Haven: Yale UP, 2001. Print. In Guinea's Ziami Strict Nature Reserve (part of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme), sections of land in the southeastern panhandle have been cordoned off to preserve the growing forest and savanna which was the traditional home of the Toma people (Fairhead).Fairhead, James, and Melissa Leach. \\"Contested Forests: Modern Conservation and Historical Land in Guinea's Ziama Reserve.\\" African Affairs 93.373 (1994): 481-512. Web. Nineteenth- century anthropologist Benjamin Anderson and contemporary anthropology professors James Fairhead and Melissa Leach have observed that, based on Toma oral history, careful Toma cultivation of high-forest areas enabled the Ziami forest to flourish along with the remaining savanna. Southern Africa The San people (also known as the Bushmen), hunter-gatherers in Botswana's Kalahari Desert, have faced hardship and‚Äîin some cases‚Äîdisplacement. The San have no land claim, and the government views them as a nomadic people.Bolaane, M. 2004. The impact of Game Reserve Policy on the River BaSarwa/Bushmen of Bot¬¨swana. Social Policy and Administration 38:399-417. Before independence, Botswana was part of the British Empire. Although the colonial government did not view the San as property owners, it provided them with a game reserve. As the San population grew, animal populations began to dwindle; this population decline and the desires to promote tourism and integrate the San into modern society led the government to consider moving them from the game reserve.Ikeya, K. 2001. Some changes among the San under the influence of relocation plan in Bot¬¨swana. In: Senri Ethnological Studies No. 59. Parks, Property and Power: Managing Hunt¬¨ing Practice and Identity within State Policy Regimes, Vol. 59 (eds. D.G. Anderson and K. Ikeya), pp. 183-198. National Museum of Ethnology, Osaka. The government of Botswana also tried limited, year-round game licenses for the San to promote conservation.Hitchcock, R. K. (2001) \\"Hunting is our Heritage: The Struggle for Hunting and Gathering Rights among the San of Southern Africa\\". In Senri Ethnological Studies No. 59 Parks, Property and Power: Managing Hunting Practice and Identity within State Policy Regimes, vol. 59 (eds. D. G. Anderson and K. Ikeya), pp. 139-156. National Museum of Ethnology, Osaka. The special game licenses did not replenish the dwindling animal populations; many officials believed that they were being abused, and the government began to restrict their distribution and again consider relocation. During the 1960s, San groups were relocated twice with the creation of the Moremi Game Reserve. Although the relocation was not forced, the San felt that they were not fully informed of its implications (Bolaane 2004). Relocation had profound effects on their lifestyle, reducing their access to the land. Forced to become wage- earners (often at one of the game reserves), they experienced social discrimination. When groups of San agreed to relocation from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) during the 1990s, adaptation to a new lifestyle (which included land ownership) was difficult and a number of people returned to the game reserve. The San founded an NGO, the First People of the Kalahari (FPK), in 1992 to advocate for land rights, social acceptance and self- determination. Role of BINGOs BINGOs (big international non-governmental organizations) may be controversial due to their partnership \\"with multinational corporations‚Äîparticularly in the businesses of gas and oil, pharmaceuticals, and mining‚Äîthat are directly involved in pillaging and destroying forest areas owned by indigenous peoples\\" (Chapin 2004). According to anthropologist Jim Igoe, \\"Ironically, there is growing evidence that national parks themselves are contributing to the very problems that advocates of community conservation are trying to solve‚Ä¶ The loss of natural resources to indigenous resource management systems that these evictions entailed frequently forced local people to mine natural resources in the area to which they were restricted\\".Igoe, Jim (2002) \\"National Parks and Human Ecosystems: The Challenge to Community Conservation.

Dawn Chatty and Marcus Colchester, eds., pp. 77-96. New York: Berghahn Books Mac Chapin writes in the introduction to his article that funding for conservation efforts has retreated from the need to work with indigenous people and local communities, \\"with a new focus on large-scale conservation strategies and the importance of science, rather than social realities, in determining their agendas\\" (Chapin 2004).

It is an archive, museum and research center devoted to the study of modern Polish history and named after the Polish interwar statesman J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. History Origins Stamp applied by the archive to documents. The Pi≈Çsudski Institute of America, a research organization and archive, came into being during the General Assembly of the National Committee of Americans of Polish Extraction (KNAPP), held at the Washington Hotel in New York City on July 3‚Äì4, 1943. The eight-member organizational committee included three prominent colleagues of Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski from the interwar period: Wac≈Çaw Jƒôdrzejewicz, former Minister of Education; Henryk Floyar-Rajchman, former Minister of Commerce and Industry; and Ignacy Matuszewski, former Finance Minister. Also present were well-known Polish- Americans, among them Franciszek Januszewski, editor of the Detroit Polish Daily; Maksymilian Wƒôgrzynek, editor of the New York Nowy ≈öwiat; and Lucjan Kupferwasser and W. Skubikowski from Chicago. Jƒôdrzejewicz commented on that event in one of his press releases: \\"Taking advantage of the presence of several prominent Polish √©migr√© activists, we decided to bring to fruition a plan that had been in the works for a long time, namely, to call into existence on July 4 the J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Institute, dedicated to the research of the most recent history of Poland.\\" This newly created entity picked up the tradition of an earlier research center established in Warsaw in 1923 and renamed after Marshal Pi≈Çsudski after his death in 1936. The organizers of the New York research center were keenly aware of the importance of collecting documents related to such a crucial period in Polish history as World War II. The initiative was also welcomed by the Polish government-in-exile ‚Äì the Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief at the time, General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski and his two successors, General Kazimierz Sosnkowski (Commander-in-Chief) and Prime Minister Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk. Hotel Washington on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, the place where the Pi≈Çsudski Institute was conceived on July 4, 1943 The death of General Sikorski on July 4, 1943 coincided with the disclosure by the Germans of the massacre of Polish officers in Katyn Forest by the Soviet NKVD. The appeal made to the International Red Cross by the Polish government-in-exile for an investigation of the atrocity was used by Stalin as a pretext to break off Polish-Russian diplomatic relations. This was a critical moment; Poland's historical and cultural heritage were now at risk from both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. After displacing the Red Army from the eastern regions of Poland, the Nazis occupied the entire country; their aim was the destruction of Polish scholarship and cultural heritage. This plan was being implemented through the extermination of the middle class, the intelligentsia, systematic plundering of libraries and museums, and by forbidding cultural, educational, and artistic activities. These actions were reinforced by mass arrests and deportations to concentration camps (such as Sonderaktion Krakau), which led to the murder of nearly all faculty of the Jagiellonian University. The closure of the Polish Academy of Sciences and other research and academic institutions left no doubt as to the Germans' intentions. Matters looked grim across Axis-occupied Europe. After the surrender of France in 1940 and the addition of Italy to the German war effort, all outposts of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Paris and Rome ceased to function. The day after the Germans entered the French capital, Gestapo agents appeared in the Polish Library on the √éle St. Louis. Although the library's director, Franciszek Pu≈Çaski, had removed the most valuable items and taken them to the south of France, the Germans confiscated or destroyed the remaining book collection and the building. Only in Great Britain and the United States did the Poles had any possibility of conducting scholarly and cultural activities. At the organizational meeting of the Institute, the following decisions were taken: * Form an eight-member organizational committee * Conduct all activities of the Warsaw Institute in absentia * Continue all activities as an American affiliate of the Warsaw headquarters after the war Franciszek Januszewski was named head of the Organization Committee, Ignacy Matuszewski his deputy, Marta Koz≈Çowska from New Jersey secretary and J√≥zef Piech treasurer. The remaining members of the committee were Henryk Floyar-Rajchman, Maksymilian Wƒôgrzynek, Lucjan Kupferwasser, W. Skubikowski and Jan Z. Dodatko from Detroit. On July 5, 1943 at its first meeting, Wac≈Çaw Jƒôdrzejewicz became the first director of the newly created Pi≈Çsudski Institute of America. The basis of the Institute's bylaws was adopted, specifying that \\"The Institute's principal aim is the collection, preservation, and research of documents related to Poland's most recent history starting in 1863, creation of archives of historical texts, publishing of books and of academic papers pertinent to that field, offering scholarships for research in the history of Poland, organizing lectures and conferences\\" as well as ‚Äì most importantly ‚Äì gathering pertinent documents for rebuilding the collections of the Institute in Warsaw which were destroyed by the Germans and Russians. At the second meeting of the Committee on September 16 of that year, Januszewski resigned as president and was replaced on an interim basis by Ignacy Matuszewski until the General Assembly of all members and election of a new board. The third meeting of the Committee took place on December 16, when the president pro tempore reported on the Institute's activities to date and the state of its finances. The final version of the bylaws was voted on, and 48 regular members joined. Other membership categories were established (supporting, life and correspondent members). The beginnings of this new entity, located at 105 East 22nd Street in Manhattan, were modest; the treasury contained $30. During the summer Jƒôdrzejewicz toured areas with large Polish populations (including Detroit, Chicago and Philadelphia), giving presentations, explaining the goals and the reasons behind the Institute, and recruiting new members. This activity also intended to forge bonds between pro-independence Polish communities, encourage collection and preservation of important archival documents and to have them transferred to the Institute. As a result, the Institute received a valuable collection of books and documents related to World War II and the activities of Polish groups in France, Great Britain, and the Near East. After World War II 105 East 22 Street, Manhattan ‚Äì Pi≈Çsudski Institute's first location The original intent of reconstructing the Institute which had existed before the war in Warsaw was not feasible because of the Yalta Agreement, which left the Polish nation for the next half-century within the Soviet sphere of influence. International recognition of the Polish government-in-exile was canceled on July 5, 1945 by Great Britain and the US (and subsequently by most members of the newly created United Nations), followed by the recognition of the Provisional Government of National Unity in Warsaw and the acceptance of the results of the election held under Russian control in January 1947. In consequence, the founders of the Institute (including the board) opted for operating a permanent and independent research organization. Its mission was now not only to gather and consolidate documents related to current political affairs, but also to disseminate accurate historical knowledge about Poland and her recent history.Pi≈Çsudski Institute website (in Polish and English) Retrieved 2011-06-19. It was an ambitious undertaking, since the Institute's founders could not count on any assistance from the Polish government-in-exile in London. From its earliest days, the functioning of the Institute depended on financial help offered by Polish √©migr√© activists, dues and donations. From the end of the 1940s, when the National Committee of Polish-Americans ceased to exist, the activities and statements by leaders of the Institute were perceived as sui generis instructions for the independence circles. These people formed a highly cohesive group, which (faithful to Marshal Pi≈Çsudski's ideals) refused to accept any compromise concerning Poland's independence and the integrity of her borders. They rejected the position espoused by then- Prime Minister Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk which promoted accepting the Treaty of Yalta and the Provisional Government of National Unity (TRJN) and later took a firmly anti-communist stand, refusing all contacts with organizations in the Polish People's Republic (PRL). From 1943 onwards those involved with the Institute were critical of the political stance of the great powers, accusing them of betraying Poland. That attitude isolated of the Institute, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s when a significant number of Polish- Americans opted for some form of contact with certain PRL organizations (if only to be able to revisit the country of their birth). In the early stages of the Institute's existence there were hopes for expanding its mission beyond the United States into other countries, where there were prominent Polish politicians and military personnel. Contact was established with the Pi≈Çsudski Group in the Middle East where Janusz Jƒôdrzejewicz, Wiktor T. Drymmer, Tadeusz Schaetzel and others were active. This cooperation continued after the group moved to Lebanon. An affiliate of the Institute was also established in Ankara through a group of politicians, among them Micha≈Ç Sokolnicki. A J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Society (still active as of 2011) was organized in S√£o Paulo, Brazil; among its members were Czes≈Çaw ≈öwirski and Karol Przetakiewicz. These efforts did not produce long-lasting results, however, mainly because of continuing migration of the military and politicians to London. After his visit to Canada and the United States in 1946, General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bortnowski founded the Pi≈Çsudski Institute in London on March 15, 1947 with the participation of Janusz Go≈Çuchowski, Ludwika Piskora, Wac≈Çaw Stachiewicz, Stefan DƒÖb-Biernacki, Jan Pi≈Çsudski, Juliusz ≈Åukasiewicz, Edward Kleszczy≈Ñski and others. At first it was viewed as an affiliate of the Institute in New York, but later became independent. From its inception the Pi≈Çsudski Institute of America struggled with many problems (mostly financial), trying to survive while continuing its activities according to its founding principles. It survived during that critical period because of the efforts of its founders and directors, who donated their time and effort from its foundation. Some of the founders, chairmen, directors, and active members were Franciszek Januszewski, Ignacy Matuszewski, Maksymilian Wƒôgrzynek, Wac≈Çaw Jƒôdrzejewicz, Marian Chodacki, Adam Koc, Jan Kowalski, Stefan ≈Åodzieski, General Wincenty Kowalski, Damian Wandycz, General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bortnowski, Henryk Floyar- Rajchman, and in later years Aleksander Me≈Çe≈Ñ-Korczy≈Ñski, Micha≈Ç Budny, Halina Janiszewska, Andrzej Zatemba, Tadeusz Paw≈Çowicz, Danuta and Andrzej Cisek, Stanis≈Çaw Jordanowski, Zarema Bau, Magdalena Kapu≈õci≈Ñska, Andrzej Beck, Czes≈Çaw Karkowski, Jerzy Prus, Janusz Cisek and Jacek Ga≈ÇƒÖzka. Due to their efforts, financial support and fundraising initiatives the Institute survived and eventually flourished, developing its activities in publishing and cataloging its extensive collection. Its unique library of documents and source material unavailable in Poland (or in other collections abroad) continue to attract many visitors who utilize these research materials. Among those who have visited the Institute over the years for information and advice are Americans, Englishmen, Belorussians, Ukrainians, Danes, Germans, Japanese and Lithuanians. During the 1940s, members of the Institute began an outreach to like-minded foreigners such as Henryk Wereszycki. At that time, efforts were undertaken to help former Prime Minister of Poland Kazimierz ≈öwitalski and Col. Wac≈Çaw Lipi≈Ñski to leave Poland. Publications and other materials were also sent to Poland, to Stanis≈Çaw P≈Çoski and others. These contacts were interrupted at the end of the 1940s during Stalinism and resumed after the \\"political thawing\\" in October 1956, when it became easier to travel from Poland to the West. At that time, Polish students who received scholarships from American foundations and from the Ko≈õciuszko Foundation began visiting the Institute. Efforts were made to single out independent scholars and researchers who, after their return to Poland, would present an unbiased picture of World War II without the communist ideological influence. Inspiring a truly independent thought process in Poland only became possible in the 1970s and '80s, however, when the Institute developed its own scholarship program supporting young scholars belonging to non-communist political groups. Since 1989 Exhibition hall at the Institute. Following the fall of the communist government in Poland in 1989, the Pi≈Çsudski Institute of America became an officially recognized organization; its increased stature in Poland was evidenced by visits from senior members of the Polish government. In 1991 the former president of the Republic of Poland visited the Institute, followed in 1992 by then-Prime Minister Jan Olszewski. Due to the political and economic changes in Poland it became possible to develop active cooperation with Polish academic and research institutions, such as the National Library in Warsaw, the Ossolineum Institute in Wroc≈Çaw, Jagiellonian University in Cracow, and the Warsaw University library. After extensive reorganization of the library collection in the mid-1990s it was discovered that the Institute possessed duplicate copies of certain publications, which were then offered to American and Polish academic institutions and the University of D√ºsseldorf. Duplicate copies of books were presented to regional libraries in Bytom, S≈Çupsk, Kielce and Rzesz√≥w. With the assistance of Jan Malicki (editor of the magazine PrzeglƒÖd Wschodni), some books found their way to libraries and schools in the former Polish eastern regions of present-day Ukraine and Belarus. In addition to the cooperation with the National Library in Warsaw (which sent librarians to help organize the Institute's library) the National Archives in Warsaw offer the aid of archivists, who help to modernize the document collections annually with the help of the Kosciuszko Foundation. Publications During its years as an √©migr√© political outpost, the Institute made efforts to publish trustworthy sources of recent Polish history. Examples of that activity are the English-language editions of Poland in the British Parliament, volumes 1-3 (edited by Wac≈Çaw Jƒôdrzejewicz) and memoirs of former Polish ambassador to Paris Juliusz ≈Åukasiewicz and former Polish ambassador to Berlin J√≥zef Lipski. Other English-language publications of scholars connected with the Institute are those of Marian K. Dziewanowski, Janusz K. Zawodny, Stanis≈Çaw Blejwas, Piotr Wandycz, Anna Ciƒôcia≈Ça and Tytus Komarnicki. At the same time, both Institutes (in London and New York) published the magazine Niepodleg≈Ço≈õƒá (Independence), originally begun in 1930s Warsaw by the Institute of Research of Recent History of Poland. Published by the Institute were books by Professor Wac≈Çaw Jƒôdrzejewicz: Kronika ≈ªycia J√≥zefa Pi≈Çsudskiego (a biography of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski) in two volumes and the four-volume Kalendarium ≈ªycia J√≥zefa Pi≈Çsudskiego (Chronicle of the Life of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, co-authored with Janusz Cisek); Krzy≈º Niepodleg≈Ço≈õci, wspomnienia ze s≈Çu≈ºby w Legionach (a memoir of service in the Pi≈Çsudski Legions) by J√≥zef Herzog; and Wspomnienia, a memoir by Juliusz Tarnowski. The research materials assembled at the Institute have been used in exhibitions, films and publications including Bitter Glory by Richard M. Watt; The Heart of Europe: A Short History of Poland by Norman Davies; The Exile Mission: The Polish Political Diaspora and Polish Americans 1939‚Äì1956 by Anna Jaroszy≈Ñska- Kirchman; the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's internet exhibit Fight and Rescue; and the film The World was Ours: The Jewish Legacy of Vilna, directed by Mia Van Doren. The Institute continues to present exhibitions and lectures. Lecturers and presenters at the Institute have included prominent writers, Solidarity activists and academics: Wojciech Ziembi≈Ñski, Marian Go≈Çƒôbiewski, Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Anna Walentynowicz, Piotr Naimski, Andrzej Nowak, Norman Davies, Janusz K. Zawodny, Juliusz ≈Åukasiewicz and Gra≈ºyna Jonkaitys-Luba. Collections As of 2011, among Polish libraries and research centers in the USA the Pi≈Çsudski Institute of America has the largest collection of documents concerning the recent history of Poland (exceeded only by that of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in California). The collection includes archives salvaged during World War II from its predecessor (the former Research Institute of Most Recent History of Poland), the Belvedere Collection (part of which consists in the archive of the Commander-in-Chief), materials from the Liquidation Committee of General Lucjan ≈ªeligowski, the archive of the Ukrainian Military Mission in Poland and the archive of the Silesian Uprisings smuggled out of Poland in September 1939. The original modest archive grew significantly through donations and bequests. New, valuable materials continued to be added from the diplomatic outposts of the Polish Republic, portfolios of private individuals and documents reflecting the organizational efforts of the Polish √©migr√© communities which found themselves in Germany at the end of the war. Documents gathered in the United States constitute about 80% of the Institute's collection. They illustrate the activities of American Polonia and include materials and documents offered by prominent statesmen, politicians, and military personalities such as historian W≈Çadys≈Çaw Pob√≥g-Malinowski (who died in France but left his archive in New York). Other archives include those of J√≥zef Lipski, Micha≈Ç Sokolnicki, Juliusz ≈Åukasiewicz, General Kazimierz Sosnkowski, Jan Weinstein and Tadeusz Katelbach. Organizations such as the Polskie Centrum Informacyjne (Polish Information Center) and Samodzielna Plac√≥wka Wywiadowcza ESTEZET (Polish Independent Intelligence Unit) have also archived their documents with the Institute. There are also earlier archives spanning the period from the second half of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th, including the collections of Leon Or≈Çowski (1891‚Äì1976) and Walerian P≈Çatonow (from 1818 to 1865). The total collection is estimated at around one million pages of documents. The Institute's research library contains about 23,000 volumes. At first the books came mostly from the Polish Information Center and the Ministry of Information and Documentation in London, from the editors of the publications R√≥j and P≈Çomyk, from the Literary Institute in Paris, Gryf Publishers and the Polish Cultural Foundation. In 1949 the library contained 2,500 volumes but with time the number of books grew, fed by individual and institutional donations (such as donations from Ignacy Matuszewski, Lucjan Kupferwasser, Wac≈Çaw Jƒôdrzejewicz, General Tadeusz Kasprzycki, General Kazimierz Sosnkowski, J√≥zef Lipski, Micha≈Ç Sokolnicki, Tadeusz Katelbach, Edward Kleszczy≈Ñski, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Pob√≥g-Malinowski and Bohdan Paw≈Çowicz's family. The Institute also has an audio-visual collection. Included are recordings of people who survived the Soviet labor camps, and personal recollections of politicians like Stefan Korbo≈Ñski and Jerzy (Jur) Lerski. There are about 3,000 press clippings and articles, from Na Stra≈ºy (On Guard) published in Jerusalem when Polish troops were stationed in Palestine and Polak w Libanie (The Pole in Lebanon, published in Beirut) to press releases from the Solidarity movement. The stamp collection contains postcards and stamps from as far back as 1818, and includes 700 postcards in a section under the heading \\"The Legions and their Founder\\". The medal, medallion and plaque collection includes items such as the medal commemorating the 1808 Battle of Somosierra and 20 medals honoring Marshal Pi≈Çsudski. The 20,000-item collection of maps and photographs is a work in progress as of 2011. An art collection of some 240 watercolors, oil paintings and drawings is preserved and displayed at the Institute.

The war began around 714 BC, with the invasion of Urartu by the Assyrian King Sargon II.Melville, Sarah \\"The Campaigns of Sargon II, King of Assyria, 721-705 B.C.\\", University of Oklahoma, 2016 Sargon led multiple offensives deep into Urartian territory, amassing numerous victories in the war. Following his death, however, Urartian Kings Argishti II and Rusa II launched many successful counterattacks, reclaiming Urartu's lost territory and gaining some from Assyria. However, their successors suffered multiple major defeats, resulting in Urartu becoming an Assyrian client state. Background The Iron Age Kingdom of Urartu began its rise to power in the mid-9th century BC. Within a century, the relatively new state had conquered the majority of what were to later be known as the Armenian Highlands. However, the Assyrian King Tiglath-Pileser III saw the rising Kingdom of Urartu as a growing threat to the safety of his kingdom. The Assyrian leadership deemed that they must end this threat through direct confrontation with the young kingdom.The Cambridge Ancient History. - Page 74 by I E S Edwards Early stages In 714 BC, King Sargon II led an offensive into Urartian territory. His early victories, especially at the Battle of Lake Urmia and his ransack of the head Uratuan temple at Mushashir, almost caused total defeat for his Uratuan counterpart, King Rusa I.Urartu Urartian counterattack After Sargon's death in 706 BC, King Rusa's successor, Argishti II, launched a major counterattack, with his forces driving the Assyrians back across the pre-war border and deep into Assyrian colonies in northwestern Iran, reconquering major towns and cities around Lake Urmia, including Mushashir, Ushnu, and Tepe. Assyrian victory The borders of Urartu and its neighbors during the final years of its existence, 610‚Äì585 BC. After the Uratuan victories during the early part of King Argishti II's reign, Urartu experienced a \\"Golden Age\\" characterized by a lengthy peace and economic prosperity throughout the remainder of Arghisti's reign and the entire rule of his successor, Rusa II.Urartu However, King Rusa III was repeatedly defeated by the Assyrians. This ultimately turned Urartu into an Assyrian client state, used as a buffer on the northern borders of this powerful empire. Aftermath Both states did not last long after the end of the war. Assyria descended into a series of bitter internal civil wars after 627 BC, leaving it open to attack. The Assyrian capital, Nineveh, was sacked and destroyed by a coalition of its former subject peoples, the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Medes, Persians, Scythians and Cimmerians, in 612 BC, with Assyria finally falling by 609 BC. The Medes and Scythians then turned on the remnants of Urartu, destroying it c. 590 BC.

They recorded a 5-song EP at a local church with Michael Mateer as recording engineer. This netted them an opportunity to play the basement of New York City's Knitting Factory. They met Brooklyn based instrumental band Skeletonbreath, who joined them for numerous shows in a Chambersburg Homeless Shelter warehouse.The Happenings (band bio), Official site .

In October 2005, they returned with Mateer to the same church where they had recorded their first EP, to do a full-length 10-song CD Red; the song \\"Yellow Cadillac\\" brought them to the attention of Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie. In December they recorded a live show in Pittsburgh with a slightly new lineup (Justin McDaniel replaced older brother Josh McDaniel on bass, and 14-year-old Sean Hallock replaced Jonathan Slick on drums). In spring of 2006, the band tried (and failed) to gain the attention of several New York labels. Meanwhile, Red had gained the attention of Seattle station KEXP. In November of that year, during CMJ's annual New York festival, the Shackeltons played a live session on KEXP and a performance at New York's Sin-√©. These led to them being signed to Seattle's Loveless Records. Meanwhile, a few months earlier, they had recorded another EP‚Äîthe Creme EP‚Äîwith Mateer. In March 2007 the Shackeltons played at Neumos in Seattle to an audience of nearly 1,000, and headed for Los Angeles to record for Loveless with producers Sam Jones and Tom Biller.

The vessel served until October 2008 when it went off charter. Mission  The mission of Cory Chouest is to directly support the Navy by using both passive and active low frequency sonar arrays to detect and track undersea threats.  Operational history In January 1991, the Cory Chouest and Amy Chouest were used as part of the Heard Island feasibility test, an experiment to transmit low frequency sound through the ocean from Heard Island in the Southern Indian Ocean as far as both ocean coasts of the US and Canada. The Cory Chouest was chosen because of its central moon pool and because it was already equipped with an array of low frequency transmitters. A phase- modulated 57Hz signal was used. The experiment was successful and demonstrated that such sound waves could travel as far as the antipodes. Planned transmissions had been for ten days, although owing to the bad weather conditions and the high failure rate of the transmitter elements, used at a frequency below their design frequency, the transmissions were terminated on the sixth day, when only two of the original ten transducers were still working.

It was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and won the Grand Prix - Golden Apricot reward at the Yerevan International Film Festival. The film was shot in Vienna, Ukraine, Romania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia from 2005 until May 2007 on 16mm film. Simultaneously, the film follows a nurse from Ukraine searching for a better life in the West and an unemployed security guard from Austria heading East for the same reason. Plot Olga is a Ukrainian woman from Eastern Ukraine, who lives with her mother and has a child. Her job as a nurse does not pay well enough for her to support herself and her baby, and she gets a second job doing internet pornography. She eventually leaves her homeland and travels to Vienna, Austria where she finds a job as a housekeeper at a rich family's home, where she also lives. However, the woman of the family suspects her of stealing and sacks her. She is then employed as a cleaner at a geriatric hospital. There, she strikes up a relationship with an elderly man named Erich and he asks her to marry him. She accepts, as she knows this will gain her Austrian citizenship. However, Erich dies of a heart attack before they can marry. Pauli is a young man from Vienna, Austria who lives with his mother and stepfather. He owns a large dog named Caeser and trains in martial arts. He works as a security guard at a shopping complex, but is sacked after a gang of drunken Turks cuff him with his own handcuffs and strip him of his clothes. His girlfriend breaks up with him as she is afraid of his dog, and he owes money to a number of people including his stepfather, Michael. Michael then takes him along on a job in Ukraine setting up video gambling machines. On the way there, they stop at an impoverished Roma Gypsy neighbourhood in Ko≈°ice, Slovakia where Pauli tries to 'hire' a prostitute. He fails to agree on a price with the Roma pimps, however, and they chase him back to his van. When they arrive in Uzhhorod, Ukraine, they rent a hotel room and try to pick up girls at a bar. When Pauli goes back to his room to borrow money from Michael to pay his tab, he finds that Michael has a prostitute. Michael insists Pauli watches him humiliate the prostitute before he can leave. The next day, Pauli leaves Michael's company and searches for work at a local market, where he fails to find any. The last we see of him is when he is walking along a long country road, hitchhiking, either back to the West or further into Ukraine.

History Agudas Achim (Community of Brothers) was founded in 1914 by a group of Orthodox Jews who met for prayer in private homes. It was chartered in 1924 and occupied leased space before erecting a brick synagogue at 909 San Jacinto. The Agudas Achim Cemetery in Austin Memorial Park on Hancock Road was purchased in 1933. The congregation joined the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism in 1948. The congregation moved to a new building on Bull Creek Road, dedicated on December 30, 1963. U.S. Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson was scheduled to the dedication, which was postponed while the congregation joined the nation in mourning the death of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. At the dedication, Jim Novy spoke about President Johnson's role in Operation Texas, a clandestine operation to use the power of the US government without formal sanction to help Eastern European Jews escape the Nazis. This is thought to have made the congregation the second American synagogue dedicated by a President. The first was the Washington Hebrew Congregation which has had cornerstones laid or buildings dedicated by Presidents McKinley, Truman and Eisenhower.History , Synagogue website. Accessed March 27, 2009. The undistinguished mid-century modern brick and glass building was renovated and upgraded in 1989. In 2001, the congregation dedicated a modern building designed by David Lake. The wood and stone sanctuary is bathed in natural light that enters via a skylight. The rusticated limestone walls resemble Jerusalem stone (both visually and geologically) but the stone, like the members of the congregation, is \\"proudly Texan\\".Henry and Daniel Stoltzman, Synagogue Architecture in America, Images Publishing, Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia, pp. 236‚Äì9.

Ika people are specifically located in the North-West of Delta State but some of their communities like Igbanke, Oligie, Inyelen and Ekpon spilled over into Edo State. Ika communities mostly comprise the following: Agbor, Owa,(Agbor and Owa being the major Ika speaking place) Umuede, Owerre Olubor, Ekuoma, Emuhu, Mbiri, Abavo, Orogodo, Otolokpo, Igbodo, Ute-Okpu, Ute-Ogbeje, Idumuesah, Akumazi, Ekpon (Edo State), Igbanke/Igbo Akiri (Edo State), Oligie (Edo State), Inyelen Edo State), Iru (Edo State). Other Ika communities found in Edo State are Owanikeke, Ute Oheze, Ute Obagie N‚ÄôOheze, Owa-Riuzor Idu and Igbogili. The Ika have a unique language, food and mode of dressing similar to their Igbo kits and kin across the River Niger and their Bini neighbours. Location Geographically, the Ika speaking people are found in the north west of Delta State. They share borders in the west with the Edo, in the north with the Ishan, in the East with the Aniocha and in the south with the Ukwuani. Politically, Ika speakers are mainly found in two local government areas, Ika North East and Ika South local government areas, both created in 1991 from a single Ika Local Government Area, in Delta State. Ika South and Ika North East local government areas, occupy a land area of 117.45 square kilometres (Delta State Government website, 1999) with a total population of about 240,000 people. There are other Ika speaking people that are political outside the Ika North east and Ika South local government areas. The exact population of speakers of the Ika language or those with Ika as mother tongue is not known since this information was not included in the 1991 census result (1991 census). Language Ika people speak the Ika language which is an igboid or dialect of the Igbo language and they have traditional rulers Eze and Ndi Ichie.  Origin  The various clans that make up Ika have many origins. But similarities of the language with Igbo suggests there might be Igbo connections. To distinguish the Ika people from other igbo ethnic groups in Delta region ,may be difficult as they do not have many physical characteristics or features which distinguish them from each other. The exact population of Ika people and speakers is about 390,000. Religion The Ika people are predominantly Christians. Some Ika people also practice Igbo traditional worship called Omenana. Ika people refer to God as Oselobue and Chukwu.91% of the population practise christian and 9% Ethnic religions. Economy The Ika (of Delta state) boast of being the home to the sweetest African Palmwine. The people of Ika tribe are majorly Farmers and the wealthiest engage in Palm kernel business with red oil extraction or other forms such as palm wine tapping.

History  During the British Raj, the British Indian Army troops depended for their medical treatment entirely on their regimental hospitals. In October 1918, Station Hospitals were sanctioned for the Indian troops. The Indian Hospital Corps (IHC) initially was divided into 10 Division Companies, which corresponded to the 10 existing Military Divisions in India and Burma. They were located at Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Multan, Quetta, Mhow, Poona, Meerut, Lucknow, Secunderabad and Rangoon. The whole corps was re-organized on command basis five companies of the IHC were created in 1932. No 1 Company was at Rawalpindi, No 2 Company at Lucknow, No 3 Company at Poona, No 4 Company at Quetta and No 5 Company at Rangoon. The World War II was responsible for rapid developments. The idea of having a homogeneous corps by amalgamating Indian Medical Services, Indian Medical Department (IMD) and Indian Hospital Corps gradually took shape and Indian Army Medical Corps (IAMC) came into being on 3 April 1943. The medical institutions of the IAMC were concentrated in the areas, which were to subsequently become Pakistan. The British Raj in India had left its legacies in the territory, which later became Pakistan. The bulk of the troops of the British Indian Army were recruited from the areas, which became Pakistan. The threats of the Russian empire and a fear of Afghans and Central Asians overrunning the Indian territory had made the British rulers wary of the northwestern borders across the Hindu Kush mountains. The army was deployed at large scale. Rawalpindi was the pivotal military base, from where they controlled the command, logistics and services provided to those troops. It was the Headquarters, Northern Command (India). Armed Forces Medical Services were one of the most organized and highly developed support services in the British Indian Army. The members of the medical profession served in the Indian Medical Services (IMS), with pride and dignity. The senior jobs in civil medical services were also reserved for the medical professionals of the army. The troops of British Indian Army were deployed over an extensive area. They were exposed to the tropical climate. They were present in the heights of Chitral in the north-west to Burma in the east. The major bulk of their health related problems were of tropical infections and parasitic infestation. The medical services were committed for the prevention and treatment of tropical diseases. Combined Military Hospital (CMH) and Military Hospital (MH) were the largest and the most well-equipped hospitals in this area at that time.  Role and task  Medical Treatment Combined Military Hospitals provide in- patient and out-patient medical and surgical treatment to the military as well as civilian population. Training CMHs serve as training centres for medical cadets, internees, post-graduate fellowship trainees, nursing cadets and nursing officers, and the paramedical staff. Preventive Health The CMHs also oversee the preventive aspects of health care provision in the cantonments. Health surveillance Health surveillance of the military personnel is done through annual medical check-ups Research and development This is done as isolated local projects in individual hospitals or as a part of army wide studies in all CMHs on subjects related to health of troops. Administration The administration is carried out by the Health Care Administrators(GDMOs) while the patient management and care is primarily the responsibility of the doctors of specialist cadre. These hospitals are run by the doctors of Pakistan's Army Medical Corps. CMHs are classified into A, B and C classes depending upon their capabilities and generally correspond to tertiary care, secondary care and primary level care hospitals respectively.

In the first two seasons of the above derby between La Fedelissima Sportiva Cuneese and Albese saw the first leg scheduled to Alba. Alba wins with a 2‚Äì0: to be reported primarily against the excesses of local fans, and Cuneo, after the match, the request to have Alba capital of the province. Cuneo is the \\"revenge\\" (sporting speaking) in the second round by winning the challenge- rematch 1‚Äì0, playing, say the chronicles, with a grit and determination that allowed them to prevail on Albese is more technical: the success was the way to erase the shame of the defeat suffered leg and torn by the opposing party suffered from the public. Much warmer they were the derby next year, the 1928‚Äì1929. In both cases, the Cuneo always won 2‚Äì0 but the second leg played in Alba on 21 April 1929 he record moments of fear: the race of the players suspended for the brawl and the public, barrel field and fisticuffs in the stands. The Faithful Polisportiva Cuneo had been a 1‚Äì0 interval lead but by the end of the first half, the Bianconeri (these were the colors of the time) were accompanied by police and by the referee in the locker room. In the second installment of the second network host, a furious melee broke out in the field and the stands and a new invasion of the area. Captain of the police intervened in the person who imposed the suspension on the match race with the visiting team that gave up the sports Alba escorted by the Royal Military Police and the Militia.  The 30s  The white and blue won the Championship Sezione Propaganda of Cuneo in 1939.  The 70s and return to the Series C  At the end of the 1970‚Äì71 season, was promoted to Serie D where, after a year of adjustment, raced three seasons and last meeting (Serie D 1974‚Äì1975) centered on the long-awaited promotion Serie C. In recent years, the team played their home games at the stadium \\"Cinzano\\" Santa Vittoria d'Alba. In this championship was saved in the Serie C 1975‚Äì1976, but relegated the following year.

However, in Serie D 1977‚Äì1978 finished third in and, thanks to the new formula of division championships with the C in C1 and C2, were promoted in the Serie C2.  The 80s and the decline  The first year Serie C2 1978‚Äì1979 was positive, but in the Serie C2 1979‚Äì1980 came the relegation to Serie D, where it served in two successive seasons. So another relegation, this time in the Promozione where, after his second place came the success of the 1982‚Äì83 and 1983‚Äì84 shows that in the Interregional, where, however, was only two years since the end of Interregional Championships 1985‚Äì1986 it returned to the Promozione. From 1986/87 to 1989/90 it served in Promozione.  The dark years of the 90s  In the summer of 1990 was found again in Serie D, but at the end of the season, Interregional Championship 1990‚Äì1991 has dropped again. A new reform of the league championships grafts Eccellenza (including the Interregional and Promozione) that Albese has played from 1991‚Äì92 to 1993‚Äì94, when it is relegated to Promozione. In 1996, she was still fished in Eccellenza, where it played from 1996‚Äì97 to 1999‚Äì00 (relegation play-out).

Among Lake's accomplishments was releasing Washington's first single vineyard designated wines and making the states first Cabernet franc, Syrah and Pinot gris wines.H. Steiman \\"Longtime Columbia Winemaker David Lake Retires\\" Wine Spectator October 17, 2006 He was the first US winemaker to hold a Master of Wine accreditation. Career After working in the British wholesale wine industry, David Lake earned his Master of Wine accreditation in 1975. He moved to the west coast of the United States where he enrolled in the enology program at the University of California, Davis. Upon completion of his studies, Lake spent a brief time in the Dundee Hills AVA of Oregon working for Eyrie Vineyards under winemaker David Lett. He also worked briefly in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA for Bethel Heights Vineyard and Amity Vineyards.H. Goldberg \\"David Lake MW dies\\" Decanter Magazine, October 7th 2009 From there he joined the Woodinville-based winery of Associated Vintners (soon to be known as Columbia Winery).A. Perdue \\"Washington wine pioneer Lake dies at 66\\" Seattle Times, October 11th, 2009 In the early 1980s, Lake pioneered the practice of producing vineyard designated wines when he released Cabernet Sauvignon from the Yakima Valley vineyards of Otis, Red Willow and Sagemoor. Working with Mike Sauer, owner and lead viticulturalist of the Red Willow Vineyard, Lake encouraged the plantings of the first Syrah vines in Washington. Noting similarities between the Red Willow vineyard and the La Chapelle vineyard of the Hermitage AOC in Rhone, Lake arranged for Syrah cuttings to be imported into the state and produced Washington's first Syrah in 1988. By 2009, Syrah would grow to be the third most widely planted red wine grape variety in Washington State. David Lake pioneered the first plantings of Syrah in Washington State. Through his career, David Lake would promote or pioneer Washington production of a wide range of grape varieties including Merlot, Viognier, Pinot gris and Cabernet franc. Among his many accomplishments, he was the first in Washington to blend Merlot and Cabernet Franc in a style similar to the Right bank of Bordeaux. David Lake's winemaking style was often described by wine experts, such as writer Paul Gregutt, as \\"European\\"-producing wines with moderate oak influence and alcohol levels. Illness and death Following the 2005 vintage, David Lake began to experience a variety of health problems, including back issues that required surgery, that prompted his retirement from Columbia Winery. After battles with heart disease and cancer, Lake collapsed in his Issaquah, Washington home on October 5, 2009 and died hours later.

It serves students from pre-kindergarten to grade 12, and is divided into a lower, middle and upper school. The student body represents 24 countries. The Head of School is Brent Bell, the Upper School Director is Chad Woods, and the Pre-K to 8 Director is Hope Jones. Founded in 1905 by local residents John Paul and Alice (Allgood) Cooper, Darlington School was named by former students in honor of a local teacher. Joseph James Darlington taught at the local J.M. Proctor School for Boys in Rome. The school originally used Thornwood House and its associated property. In 1920 the school moved to the current location of Desoto Park and has expanded around this 500 acre area. Darlington School uses an English public school-style house system in the upper school. Each house is led by a Head of House faculty member and a resident and day student prefect. Boys' houses include Summerbell (first-year house), Moser, and Neville. Girls' houses include Cooper (first-year house), Regester, and Thornwood. The school participates in Greater Opportunities for Access to Learning (GOAL), a Georgia program which offers a state income tax credit to donors of scholarships to private schools.  History  Founded in 1905 by John Paul and Alice Allgood Cooper, Darlington School was named in honor of a teacher by his former students. Joseph James Darlington taught at the J. M. Proctor School for Boys in Rome, where the quality of his character so impressed his students that a group of them resolved to build a school to perpetuate the memory of their beloved teacher. Present-day Darlington students feel J. J. Darlington's influence in every phase of campus life, for he believed in academic excellence and insisted upon honest, diligent effort in the preparation of daily assignments. His most vital concern, however, was the development of capable and responsible human beings, worthy of trust and responsive to it. Though he stressed the importance of sound scholarship and the necessity for discipline, his chief emphasis was always upon character and service. To quote from the original charter, Darlington was organized and incorporated \\"not for pecuniary gain\\" but \\"for educational and literary purposes, in which may be taught all branches of learning.\\" To this end, Darlington as a college- preparatory school expects and demands of its students sound scholarship, honest and diligent effort, and a continued focus on good character. Wilcox Hall (formerly Old Main) is the main administrative building for Darlington School. It houses the Head of School's office, other Administrators, and Moser and Neville Boys' Houses. The school opened Sept. 11, 1905, with Founding Headmaster Dr. James Ross McCain teaching 24 boys in eight classes. The building that was to become the first permanent home was not ready for occupancy, so the upstairs room above the Rome Fire Department station in East Rome was rented for temporary quarters. The school was moved to a new location on East Ninth Street in 1906. In December 1916, DeSoto Park (the current site of Darlington School) was purchased by John Paul Cooper. After two large fundraising campaigns and a great deal of support from the Rome community, the school was moved to its current location in 1923. The same year, Darlington declared itself a boarding and day school, enrolling 30 boarding students. In April 1973, the Board of Trustees voted for the consolidation of the 68-year- old institution with Thornwood School for Girls. Earlier, trustees had approved the establishment of an elementary division and a boarding department for secondary school girls. Resulting changes saw the Lower School installed on the Thornwood campus, which was located on Shorter Avenue in downtown Rome; the Middle School continuing in the former Junior School building; and the Upper School consolidated on the main campus. In 1980 and 1988, kindergarten and pre-kindergarten were added, respectively. In 2013, Darlington sold the Thornwood campus to Shorter University and moved the Lower School to the main campus, creating a true community atmosphere. Annual total enrollment is approximately 850 students in grades PK-12. Darlington's campus is the location of Alhambra-Home on the Hill. The oldest home in Floyd County, and the location the name of Rome was determined. The home is now the residence of The Head of School, and has been for every Head of School at the school.  Sexual abuse allegations  In June 2017, in the wake of teacher-student sexual abuse allegations at Choate, Darlington announced an investigation into sexual abuse between its faculty and students. The investigation was sparked by the allegations of a former student, who had reported sexually inappropriate behavior by a dorm master in the 1980s. The student claims the inappropriate behavior was reported to the school administration and nothing was done. Darlington hired a law firm to investigate the claims in 2016, and in 2017 sent a letter to former and current students informing them of the investigation.[Judd, Alan. \\"Sex abuse inquiry delves into private school's secret past\\" Atlanta Journal-Constitution June 2, 2017 http://www.myajc.com/news/state--regional/sex-abuse-inquiry-delves-into- private-school-secret-past/oGlTNJIPhjAqyTsoAqVgHP/] Notable alumni * Jane Campbell ‚Äì professional soccer player * James Dickey ‚Äì poet, novelist, author of Deliverance.

He was born in Madrid in 1784 and moved with parents to C√≥rdoba when young. He studied law at C√≥rdoba University and obtained his doctorate at the Real Universidad de San Felipe in Santiago de Chile. He opened a law practice in Buenos Aires, and lived there at the time of the British invasions. He offered his services as volunteer in the militia but was declined due to poor health.Ione S. Wright and Lisa M. Nekhom, Historical Dictionary of Argentina (1978) pp 30-31  Second Tiumvirate  √Ålvarez Jonte took part on the preparations for the May Revolution in 1810. After the revolution, the newly constituted Primera Junta sent him to Chile to try to foment a similar revolution there. This happened in October 1810, and √Ålvarez Jonte became the first Argentine ambassador to this country. Towards the end of 1810 he was in Buenos Aires and he joined Mariano Moreno's revolutionary group. The Junta named him member of the Cabildo, where he pressed to dissolve the governing Junta when news of the Battle of Huaqui disaster arrived. He supported the formation of the First Triumvirate, and by their initiative he was named again rector of the Cabildo for the year 1812. He moved to the opposition when the government of Rivadavia dissolved the first national assembly in 1812. √Ålvarez Jonte joined the Lautaro lodge, founded by Alvear and San Mart√≠n, and supported the October 1812 revolution, (started by San Mart√≠n after the arrival of the news of the military victory at the Battle of Tucum√°n). By this movement the First Triumvirate was dissolved and replaced by a Second Triumvirate, formed by Juan Jos√© Paso, Nicol√°s Rodr√≠guez Pe√±a, and √Ålvarez Jonte. A short while later Paso was replaced by Jos√© Juli√°n P√©rez, and a few months later, Rodr√≠guez Pe√±a was replaced by Gervasio Posadas, Alvear's uncle. In reality, the government was controlled by the Lautaro Lodge and by Alvear. The Triumvirate called for a National Constitutional Assembly, dominated by Buenos Aires where most of the deputies from the interior of the country were named by the Lodge, in Buenos Aires. The Assembly did not meet its objectives, not having declared independence from Spain, nor sanctioning any constitution. By the end of 1813, Juan Larrea (a rich and influential friend of Alvear and of British commerce) replace √Ålvarez Jonte, who was named to lead the commission investigating the military defeats at Vilcapugio and Ayohuma.  Collaboration with San Mart√≠n  √Ålvarez Jonte travelled to Tucum√°n to start the investigations and legal proceedings, but later he declined to judge general Belgrano. In early 1814 he reorganized the government of Tucum√°n Province. Was then named as military comptroller to the Army of the North during the short period where its commander in chief was San Mart√≠n. √Ålvarez Jonte then returned to Buenos Aires, where he served as general war comptroller, and worked in this post during the brief government of Alvear. After the mutiny that led to the Alvear's fall from government, he was exiled to London. There he joined the local Lautaro Lodge and dedicated himself to the formation of a navy squadron for Chile, recently liberated from Spain by San Mart√≠n, supporting the latter's plans to attack the Viceroyalty of Peru by sea. He arrived in Chile with Admiral Thomas Cochrane in November 1818, with the navy's ships intended to move the Army of the Andes to Peru. Even though he fell ill, he was named army comptroller and secretary to San Mart√≠n. He accompanied Cochrane in the first naval campaign to the port of El Callao. In August 1820 he embarked with San Mart√≠n towards Peru again. A short time after arriving, he fell gravely ill (probably of tuberculosis) and died in October 1820 in the port of Pisco. An avenue in Buenos Aires's Monte Castro neighborhood, is named after him.  References  Further reading * Wright, Ione S., and Lisa M. Nekhom.

He was Majority Leader of the New York State Senate in 1965, the only Democrat in this position since the adoption of the New York State Constitution of 1938 until Malcolm Smith attained the position in 2009. Early life, education, and military service Zaretzki was born on March 9, 1900.University Libraries: Special Collections & Archives: Politics and Politicians, University at Albany, SUNY. He was born in Warsaw and came to the United States in childhood.Glenn Fowler, Joseph Zaretzki, Former Albany Leader, Dies, New York Times (December 21, 1981). He served in the U.S. Army during World War I. He graduated from Columbia College and Columbia Law School. Career Zaretzki practiced law in Upper Manhattan and entered politics toward the end of the Great Depression, and rose within Tammany Hall, becoming a district leader. In November 1947, he was elected to the New York State Senate, to fill the vacancy caused by the appointment of Alexander A. Falk as Civil Service Commissioner.Senator Zaretzki Is Sworn in the New York Times on November 18, 1947 Zaretzki represented the Washington Heights area of Manhattan from 1948 to 1974, sitting in the 166th, 167th, 168th, 169th, 170th, 171st, 172nd, 173rd, 174th, 175th, 176th, 177th, 178th, 179th and 180th New York State Legislatures. He was the Democratic Minority Leader from 1957 to 1964, and from 1966 to 1974. As a state senator, Zaretzki could be both \\"fiery and humorous\\"; he once called for Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller to be impeached, but later admitted that \\"he had merely intended to capture the interest of spectators in the gallery.\\" New York Times editorial board member William V. Shannon said, \\"To call Zaretzki a hack, would be undue praise.\\"Jack Newfield, RFK: A Memoir (Thunder's Mouth Press: 1969), 2003 ed., pp. 146-47. Zaretzki was allied to Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. and Tammany Hall leader J. Raymond Jones; he was opposed by the Reform Democrats and anti-Wagner Democrats, who sought to block Zaretzki from power in the state Senate. In 1965, the Democratic Party achieved for the only time since 1938 a majority in the State Senate, but the Democratic senators were divided in two factions, 15 senators allied with Mayor of New York City Robert F. Wagner, Jr., and 18 senators allied with U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy. After a month of deadlock, Zaretzki‚Äîthe long-time Minority Leader‚Äîwas elected Temporary President on February 3 with the votes of the Wagner men and the Republicans who had voted for Earl W. Brydges, but were urged by Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller to end the deadlock. His election to the majority leadership, in TIME Magazine on February 12, 1965 Zaretzki's political career ended in 1974, when Franz S. Leichter defeated him in the Democratic primary election. Leichter, a state assemblyman, was from the Reform wing of the Democratic Party and was nearly three decades younger than Zaretzki.Linda Greenhouse, Zaretzki, Democratic Leader in State Since 1957, Is Defeated by Leichter, New York Times (September 10, 1974).

Funded by the United States National Science Foundation (NSF), it is a product of the Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN). NCN supports research efforts in nanoelectronics; nanomaterials; nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS); nanofluidics; nanomedicine, nanobiology; and nanophotonics. History The Network for Computational Nanotechnology was established in 2002 to create a resource for nanoscience and nanotechnology via online services for research, education, and professional collaboration. Initially a multi-university initiative of eight member institutions including Purdue University, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Molecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Norfolk State University, Northwestern University, and the University of Texas at El Paso, NCN now operates entirely at Purdue. The US National Science Foundation (NSF) provided grants of approximately $14 million from 2002 through 2010, with principal investigator Mark S. Lundstrom. Continuing US NSF grants have been awarded since 2007 with principal investigator Gerhard Klimeck and co-principal investigator Alejandro Strachan, with total funding of over $20 million. Resources The Web portal of NCN is nanoHUB.org and is an instance of a HUBzero hub. It offers simulation tools, course materials, lectures, seminars, tutorials, user groups, and online meetings. Interactive simulation tools are accessible from web browsers and run via a distributed computing network at Purdue University, as well as the TeraGrid and Open Science Grid. These resources are provided by hundreds of member contributors in the nanoscience community. Main resource types: * Interactive simulation tools for nanotechnology and related fields * Course curricula for educators * News and events for nanotechnology * Lectures, podcasts and learning materials in multiple formats * Online seminars * Online workshops * User groups * Online group meeting rooms * Virtual Linux workspaces that facilitate tool development within an in-browser Linux machine Simulation tools The nanoHUB provides in-browser simulation tools geared toward nanotechnology, electrical engineering, materials science, chemistry, and semiconductor education. nanoHUB simulations are available to users as both stand-alone tools and part of structured teaching and learning curricula comprising numerous tools. Users can develop and contribute their own tools for live deployment. Examples of tools include: ;SCHRED: calculates envelope wavefunctions and the corresponding bound-state energies in a typical Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) or Semiconductor-Oxide-Semiconductor (SOS) structure and a typical SOI structure by solving self-consistently the one- dimensional (1D) Poisson equation and the 1D Schr√∂dinger equation. ;Quantum Dot Lab: computes the eigenstates of a particle in a box of various shapes including domes and pyramids. ;Bulk Monte Carlo Tool: calculates the bulk values of the electron drift velocity, electron average energy and electron mobility for electric fields applied in arbitrary crystallographic direction in both column 4 (Si and Ge) and III-V (GaAs, SiC and GaN) materials. ;Crystal Viewer: helps in visualizing various types of Bravais lattices, planes and Miller indices needed for many material, electronics and chemistry courses. Also large bulk systems for different materials (Silicon, InAs, GaAs, diamond, graphene, Buckyball) can be viewed using this tool. ;Band Structure Lab: computes and visualizes the band structures of bulk semiconductors, thin films, and nanowires for various materials, growth orientations, and strain conditions. Physical parameters such as the bandgap and effective mass can also be obtained from the computed band structures. ;nano-Materials Simulation Toolkit: uses molecular dynamics to simulate materials at the atomic scale. ;DFT calculations with Quantum ESPRESSO: uses density functional theory to simulate the electronic structure of materials. Infrastructure Rappture Toolkit The Rappture (Rapid APPlication infrastrucTURE) toolkit provides the basic infrastructure for the development of a large class of scientific applications, allowing scientists to focus on their core algorithm. It does so in a language-neutral fashion, so one may access Rappture in a variety of programming environments, including C/C++, Fortran and Python. To use Rappture, a developer describes all of the inputs and outputs for the simulator, and Rappture generates a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the tool automatically. Jupyter notebooks To complement the existing Rappture GUI tools within nanoHUB, the more recent browser based Jupyter notebooks are also available on nanoHUB, since 2017. Jupyter in nanoHUB offer new possibilities using the existing scientific software, and most notably all Rappture tools, within nanoHUB with the notebooks of interspersed code (e.g. Python, text, and multimedia. Workspaces A workspace is an in-browser Linux desktop that provides access to NCN's Rappture toolkit, along with computational resources available on the NCN, Open Science Grid, and TeraGrid networks. One can use these resources to conduct research, or as a development area for new simulation tools. One may upload code, compile it, test it, and debug it. Once code is tested and working properly in a workspace, it can be deployed as a live tool on nanoHUB. A user can use normal Linux tools to transfer data into and out of a workspace. For example, sftp yourlogin@sftp.nanohub.org will establish a connection with a nanoHUB file share. Users can also use built-in WebDAV support on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux operating systems to access their nanoHUB files on a local desktop. Middleware The web server uses a daemon to dynamically relay incoming VNC connections to the execution host on which an application session is running. Instead of using the port router to set up a separate channel by which a file import or export operation is conducted, it uses VNC to trigger an action on the browser which relays a file transfer through the main nanoHUB web server. The primary advantage of consolidating these capabilities into the web server is that it limits the entry point to the nanoHUB to one address: www.nanohub.org. This simplifies the security model as well as reduces on the number of independent security certificates to manage. One disadvantage of consolidating most communication through the web server is the lack of scalability when too much data is transferred by individual users. In order to avoid a network traffic jam, the web server can be replicated and clustered into one name by means of DNS round-robin selection. The backend execution hosts that support Maxwell can operate with conventional Unix systems, Xen virtual machines, and a form of virtualization based on OpenVZ. For each system, a VNC server is pre-started for every session. When OpenVZ is used, that VNC server is started inside of a virtual container. Processes running in that container cannot see other processes on the physical system, see the CPU load imposed by other users, dominate the resources of the physical machine, or make outbound network connections. By selectively overriding the restrictions imposed by OpenVZ, it is possible to synthesize a fully private environment for each application session that the user can use remotely. Usage The majority of users come from academic institutions using nanoHUB as part of their research and educational activities. Users also come from national labs and private industry. As a scientific resource, nanoHUB was cited hundreds of times in the scientific literature, peaking in 2009. Approximately sixty percent of the citations stem from authors not affiliated with the NCN. More than 200 of the citations refer to nanotechnology research, with more than 150 of them citing concrete resource usage. Twenty citations elaborate on nanoHUB use in education and more than 30 refer to nanoHUB as an example of national cyberinfrastructure. nanoHUB-U The nanoHUB-U online course initiative was developed to enable students to study a subject in a five-week framework roughly equivalent to a 1-credit class. No credit is given ‚Äì quizzes and exams are simple and are intended to be aids to learning rather than rigorous tests for acquired skills. In the spirit of a research university, nanoHUB-U courses aim to bring new advances and understanding from research into the curriculum; in addition, simulation (often from nanoHUB) are heavily included in the courses. Every effort is made to present courses in a way that is accessible to beginning graduate students with a variety of different backgrounds with a minimum number of prerequisites. The ideal nanoHUB-U course is accessible to any students with an undergraduate degree in engineering or the physical sciences. Courses include nanoelectronics, nanoscale materials, and nanoscale characterization. nanoHUB-U courses are now a part of edX.

Club history It was formed on 1 December 2005 as the result of a merger of St Grellan's GFC and Ballinasloe Hurling Club.Historic first AGM of Ballinasloe GAA, ballinasloe.com , accessed 2 September 2008. Ballinasloe‚Äôs first ever hurling game took place on The Fair Green on Easter Monday 1884 between Killimor and Eyrecourt. Since this date Gaelic Games have been a pillar in Ballinasloe‚Äôs society. Since the games‚Äô inception its popularity in Ballinasloe has been integral to its success. The first football game in Ballinasloe GAA‚Äôs successful history took place on 31 March 1893 in a field in Pollboy. The game was between Creagh and Ballinasloe. Ballinasloe was captained by Thomas Cunningham and Creagh by T.F Burke. Creagh came out on top in a low scoring game of 2-01 to 1 point. Late that year in June 1893, Ballinasloe fulfilled another fixture where they were welcomed out to Kiltormer to take on Killoran in a Gaelic Football game under GAA rules. Ballinasloe's association with Gaelic games can be traced back beyond an inaugural meeting of the GAA which was held in Thurles on 1 November 1884; on an earlier date in 1884, Killimor and the Dublin Metropolitan Hurling team played a hurling challenge in Ballinasloe and included in that Dublin team was Michael Cusack who later in the same year, was to be a founder member of the association. In 1889, Ballinasloe had a football club with J.F. Gibney as captain. Despite the Parnell crisis, the Galway Football Championship for 1891 was played and Ballinasloe participated, playing Mountbellew in Ahascragh on 24 May of that year. In 1892, P.D. Brennan of Ballinasloe became Assistant County Secretary. Up to 1913 the Ballinasloe club had not enjoyed success on the field of play. Between 1887 and 1912, Tuam won twelve County Titles, Dunmore won eight, other winners being Loughrea and Athenry while Ballinasloe was without a title. In 1931, Joe Kelleher led Galway to All Ireland victory in the Junior Championship. Ballinasloe GAA has enjoyed continued success at all levels in both Hurling and Football. It has seen many of its members see the maroon and white of Galway. It continues to participate at a high level and with the amalgamation of hurling and football codes, development of their new facilities and recent announcement of further development in 2014, will surely continue to enjoy success far into the future.

They do this by helping to elect pro-ocean Congressional candidates and working to defeat the others. Ocean Champions engages with members of Congress to pass pro-ocean laws and shoot down bills that would harm the ocean. Co-founder David Wilmot defines the organization as a ‚Äúblue group‚Äù, instead of a ‚Äúgreen group‚Äù to emphasize its focus on the oceans. In 2016, Ocean Champions made history! For the first time in the history of the Peter Benchley Ocean Awards an organization will receive the highly regarded Excellence in Policy Award.

Ocean Champions works with both Democrats and Republicans. Ocean Champions supported Rep. Farr and worked to defeat re-election of Representative Richard Pombo in 2006. From 2004 to 2014, Ocean Champions has had an 86% success rate of endorsed candidates winning their respective elections. In 2014 Ocean Champions defeated Ocean Enemy #1 Steve Southerland and support 68 champions serving in the 114th Congress. Ocean topics Though young, Ocean Champions has already achieved several legislative victories, and that influence continues to grow. Ocean Champions was a major player in the re-authorization of a stronger Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Management Law, and helped defeat a farm bill amendment that would have exacerbated over-fishing. Key Champions in Congress helped protect the moratorium on new oil drilling off our coasts in 2006 and 2007 and led the efforts in holding BP accountable in 2010. Ocean Champions played a key role in obtaining the President‚Äôs Executive Order for a National Ocean Policy.

She was the daughter of Judge John Martin, the first Chief Justice of the Cherokee Nation and Nellie McDaniel. John Martin Thompson  The Cherokees and the Mount Tabor Indian Community  Thompson's family had ties to the Cherokee Ridge Party, who supported the removal treaty known as the Treaty of New Echota.Cherokee Cavaliers: Forty Years of Cherokee History As Told in the Correspondence of the Ridge-Watie- Boudinot Family, 1939 By Edward Everett Dale and Gaston Litton, University of Oklahoma Press In 1848, Thompson's family left the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory along with other Ridge Party and Old Settler supporters to settle in Rusk County, Texas. B.F. Thompson initially purchased in the spring of 1844 near present-day Laird Hill, Texas, on which the family made its home. The community later became known as the Mount Tabor Indian Community, the name given to the area by John Adair Bell as recorded in the book Cherokee Cavaliers, (pg 80). J.M. Thompson, although growing up in the Cherokee Nation, in both Georgia and Indian Territory, got his formal education, along with his brother William Wirt Thompson, at the Western Military College, then located at Georgetown, Kentucky. The brothers spent two years at the college before returning to east Texas and becoming deeply involved in the families plantation.John Martin Thompson biography 1905: Texas Transportation Archive http://www.ttarchive.com/Library/Biographies/Thompson-John-M_1906_American- Lumberman-Biographies-Vol-2.html American Civil War During the American Civil War (1861-1865), most Mount Tabor Cherokees joined Brigadier General Stand Watie, the only Indian to reach the rank of General in the Confederate Army. Watie, his wife and other family members lived at Mount Tabor for short periods during the war. However, John Martin Thompson did not serve or organize units for Watie's Confederate Cherokees. Rather he organized units at Bellview, a town that came from the Mount Tabor Indian Community, to serve with Texas military units. These were made up of the few Cherokees that did not serve with Watie, as well as local Yowani Choctaws and inter-married whites. Thompson who was wounded on multiple occasions during the four year war, quickly rose to the rank of Major in the Confederate Army. The largest loss of life during the war by Mount Tabor Indians that organized under Thompson, was the Battle of Jenkins Ferry in Saline County, Arkansas. This war, both in surrounding states and Indian Territory, took the lives of over 25% of the male population. Reconstruction Following the American Civil War, J.M. Thompson became one of the largest lumbermen in Texas.The Thompson Collection, Stephen F. Austin State University, Nacogdoches, Texas During the reconstruction era and into the early twentieth centuries Thompson along with his sons built their vast holdings in timber through a series of sound business decisions. In 1881, they left the Rusk County area, moving operations into Trinity County in order to market their product via the Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad. They facilitated their marketing campaigns by developing connections to retail lumberyards. Further, they organized a series of companies to expedite and manage their ever-growing timber empire. Thus were formed the Thompson and Tucker Lumber Company followed by the J. M. Thompson Lumber Company, the Thompson Brothers Lumber Company, and finally the Thompson and Ford Lumber Company.

He is also well known as a founder and a member of the Yugoslav new wave band Idoli in the 1980s.P. Janjatoviƒá, Idoli, YU rock enciklopedija 1960-1967, Beograd, 1998.  Biography  ≈†aper was born in Belgrade in 1958 as a son of teacher Ljiljana and professor Radomir ≈†aper. His family lived in the Vasina Street until they moved to Nevesinjska Street in the Vraƒçar neighborhood. ≈†aper attended the Sveti Sava elementary school followed by the Eight Belgrade Gymnasium (now known as the Third Belgrade Gymnasium). During high school, he became interested in the work of Carl Jung and his analytical psychology. This was one of the reasons ≈†aper enrolled in the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Medicine where he developed friendships with future bandmate Neboj≈°a Krstiƒá as well as Boris Tadiƒá who would go to become the President of Serbia. In March 1979, with friends Krstiƒá and Vlada Divljan, 20-year-old ≈†aper formed Idoli,http://www.diplomacyandcommerce.rs/sapers-story-about-idols-about- divljan-krstic-and-defence/ a new wave band that quickly became popular throughout SFR Yugoslavia. He quit the medical studies, enrolling at the Belgrade's Faculty of Dramatic Arts and graduating with a degree in film direction. When Idoli disbanded in 1984, ≈†aper worked with Bucko & Tucko, a company that recorded TV commercials, and starred in Davitelj protiv davitelja movie as Spiridon Kopicl. He also worked on the soundtrack and wrote the song \\"Beogradski davitelj\\" which he performed with the imaginary band VIS Simboli. In 1987 he recorded Poslednja mladost u Jugoslaviji with Neboj≈°a Krstiƒá. He joined the Democratic Party in 1990 and in 1993 started working on political campaigns, later with his own company \\"Idols & Friends\\" formed in 1995. The following year Neboj≈°a Krstiƒá and Piloti singer Zoran Lesendriƒá Kiki and he formed Dobrovoljno Pevaƒçko Dru≈°tvo. The band released only one album Nedelja na Duhove and disbanded. In 1997. Srƒëan ≈†aper signed an affiliate contract with McCann Worldgroup and opened agencies in Belgrade and Skopje. In the following years, I&F; McCann Grupa established agencies in other countries in the Balkan region, and today the group operates in twelve countries of South East Europe and Nordic region. Srƒëan ≈†aper is the owner of the Novembar art gallery in Belgrade. He is also the author of the original idea for the TV series BESA. He had been identified as one of two dozen Serbian citizens mentioned in the Panama Papers.in this Bizzmark report  Musical career   VIS Deƒçaci and Idoli  ≈†aper became interested in forming a musical group with his friend Neboj≈°a Krstiƒá and at a party during the late 1979 he made a deal with his close high school friend Vlada Divljan to start playing together. ≈†aper was to play guitar, Krstiƒá was to play guitar and Divljan was to be the drummer. The band was called Deƒçaci (The Boys). Divljan took them to his apartment building basement where he and his friends kept their instruments and tried playing. Having realized there was no progress, the band was joined by Divljan's friends and neighbors Zdenko Kolar (bass) and Bo≈æa Jovanoviƒá (drums) with whom he previously played. Krstiƒá and ≈†aper became percussionists and did the vocals. Since the two wore beards, the band was renamed to Deƒçaci plus Bradonje (The Boys plus The Bearded). The band was soon renamed to Idoli. In the meantime Deƒçaci started working with Dragan Papiƒá, who became the band's media activist and published photos in \\"Vidici\\" and \\"Izgled\\" youth magazines, but when the band included Zdenko Kolar and Bo≈æa Jovanoviƒá, whom Papiƒá did not like, Papiƒá stopped working with the band. He did however manage to persuade \\"Vidici\\" and \\"Izgled\\" to finance the recording of the first single. Idoli were officially formed on March 1, 1980 at a rehearsal where they wrote some of the most notable songs of that period, including \\"Retko te viƒëam sa devojkama\\" and \\"Pomoƒá, pomoƒá\\" which appeared on the first single released a month later. The single was labeled as Izgled and appeared with the April issue of \\"Vidici\\" magazine. Soon after the band started working on the Paket aran≈æman project which was released in 1981 by Jugoton. In the meantime the band released a new single, \\"Maljƒçiki\\" with a new version of \\"Retko te viƒëam sa devojkama\\". ≈†aper and Divljan were credited as writers of \\"Maljƒçiki\\". The promotional video for \\"Maljƒçiki\\" was first broadcast on New Year's Eve 1981 in the \\"Rokenroler\\" show. The song became a nationwide hit and caused a protest of the Soviet embassy, as the song was a parody on Russian working class. In 1982 the public was expecting the Idoli debut record which turned out to be a 12\\" EP called VIS Idoli. The EP contained six songs including two covers and was a major success as it was sold in about 200.000 copies. The band went on a tour with the band Film). Having finished the tour, during the late 1982, the band started working on the first long play album released in early 1983. The album was called Odbrana i poslednji dani and did not become a commercial hit as it was a complex concept album dealing with an anthropological attitude towards Orthodoxy which was a bit of a taboo topic in Yugoslavia at the time. ≈†aper provided vocals for \\"Senke su drugaƒçije\\", \\"Nemo\\", \\"Igrale se delije\\" and \\"Odbrana\\". For this record ≈†aper played synthesizer and was credited as a partial author. Since Odbrana i poslednji dani was sold only in 50.000 copies which was considered failure, the band had to turn towards a more commercial sound. New album was recorded in London with producer Bob Painter who completely changed the band's style. The album ƒåokolada was the band's greatest success, sold in 350.000 copies which was a record at the time. All songs were written by Divljan, Krstiƒá and ≈†aper provided lead vocals for \\"Tiho, tiho\\", \\"Bambina\\" (released on single) and \\"Udri bogata≈°a\\". The tour followed the album but, beside successful and sold-out shows, after the Ljubljana concert due to a quarrel, the band ceased to exist. D≈æuboks magazine critics voted the album the greatest Yugoslav rock album of the 20th century in 1985. The album was polled in 1998 as Yugoslav greatest popular music album in the book YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike. In 2015, Odbrana i poslednji dani was polled the greatest Yugoslav rock album in the special edition of Croatian Rolling Stone. ≈†aper participated the recording of the last Idoli release, the ≈†est dana juna soundtrack album where he provided vocals.  Post Idoli career  In 1986 ≈†aper with Neboj≈°a Krstiƒá formed a band called Unutra≈°nja Imperija and recorded the album Poslednja mladost u Jugoslaviji released by Jugoton in 1987. The two also performed live at the Zagreb festival in 1987. In March 1991 ≈†aper appeared as guest at the Akcija band concert at SKC and performed the song \\"Beogradski davitelj\\" from the movie \\"Davitelj protiv davitelja\\". The recording of the song is available on bootleg. In 1995 the two joined by Piloti frontman Kiki Lesendriƒá formed a supergroup Dobrovoljno Pevaƒçko Dru≈°tvo. The band went to Budapest and recorded the album in the \\"Utopia\\" studio with Hungarian session musicians. on the album also appeared Nenad Stefanoviƒá Japanac (bass and guitar), Milan ƒêurƒëeviƒá (keyboards) and Aleksandra and Kristina Kovaƒç who did the backing vocals.

The three members were credited as song authors. ≈†aper did the vocals on \\"Sestrice mala\\", \\"Arcadia\\", \\"Zemlja\\", \\"Laura\\" and \\"Little Sister\\", the last two featuring lyrics in English language. In 1996 both ≈†aper and Krstiƒá appeared on the Akcija self-titled debut on the track \\"7 dana\\".

A federation of nationally-organized societies of men and women and local and provincial councils of women, it is the Canadian member of the International Council of Women (ICW). The Council has concerned itself in areas including women's suffrage, immigration, health care, education, mass media, the environment, and many others. Formed on October 27, 1893 in Toronto, Ontario, it is one of the oldest advocacy organizations in the country. Lady Aberdeen was elected the first president of the National Council of Women of Canada in 1893. Prominent Council leaders included Lady Gzowski, Dr. Augusta Stowe-Gullen, and Adelaide Hoodless. Founding The International Council of Women was founded in 1888 in Washington D.C., United States. By May 1893, the IWC World's Congress of Representative Women had met in Chicago and discussed creating a Canadian Council. The Council formally began its existence on October 27 at a public meeting at the Horticultural Pavilion of the Allan Gardens in Toronto. Over 1,500 women attended the meeting, which was chaired by Lady Aberdeen, wife of then-Governor General John Campbell Hamilton-Gordon, 7th Earl of Aberdeen. Lady Aberdeen served as the Council's first president until her resignation in 1899; she was succeeded by Lady Taylor. Activities The Council serves an advisory role on issues based on existing organization policy. New policies are proposed as resolutions, which are developed through grassroots discussions on the local and provincial scale and are then debated and voted upon. If they are accepted, they become policies. The organization then creates briefs (formal papers based on policy), which suggest a course of action and are submitted to an official body, such as a government. The organization has sent representatives to government boards and international bodies such as the League of Nations. The Council played a key role in creating the Victorian Order of Nurses, the Children's Aid Society, and the Canadian Association of Consumers. One of the first affiliate organizations was the Women's Art Association of Canada, of which Lady Aberdeen was the sponsor. It has also played a role in developing the Women's Bureau of Labour Canada, the Federal Bureau on Ageing, and supported the call for the Royal Commission on the Status of Women, which created the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women. The Council's major cause 1894-1918 was its fight to upgrade the status of women, without seeking the vote. It promoted a vision of \\"transcendent citizenship\\" for women. The ballot was not needed, for citizenship was to be exercised through personal influence and moral suasion, through the election of men with strong moral character, and through raising public-spirited sons. The National Council position was integrated into its nation-building program that sought to uphold Canada as a White settler nation. While the woman suffrage movement was important for extending the political rights of White women, it was also authorized through race-based arguments that linked White women's enfranchisement to the need to protect the nation from \\"racial degeneration.\\"Anne-Marie. Kinahan, \\"Transcendent Citizenship: Suffrage, the National Council of Women of Canada, and the Politics of Organized Womanhood,\\" Journal of Canadian Studies (2008) 42#3 pp 5-27 Between 1914 and 1921 the NCWC published the monthly journal Woman's Century. The purpose was to educate women about public issues and the reforms that were needed, and to provide a forum for discussion by different women's groups. The title page described it as \\"A journal of education and progress for Canadian women.\\" The monthly journal was modeled on successful British and American feminist periodicals. It was one of the very few women's rights journals published in Canada. In 1918, the federal government granted women the right to vote in federal elections. In 1929, The Famous Five won Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General), commonly known as the \\"Persons case\\", which determined that women were \\"persons\\". Three of The Five were active members of the NCWC, and the NCWC played a vital role in winning the case. Other causes include child welfare measures such as preventing child abuse, and encouraging education and good health care. General health measures include pasteurization, clean water, and medical inspections in schools. The Council has also fought controversial battles, such as broadening the grounds for divorce, wider availability of birth control information, removing abortion from the Criminal Code, and programs to protect and rehabilitate prostitutes. The organization holds Consultative Status (II) with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Notable members The Famous Five with Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in 1931. Several members of the Council have played prominent roles in Canadian history. Lady Aberdeen was instrumental in forming the Canadian branch of the National Council of Women. She had the first idea of creating the organization, despite other statements. Augusta Stowe-Gullen, one of the Society's co-founding members, was the first woman to earn a medical degree in Canada and was an important figure in the women's suffrage movement. Matilda Ridout Edgar (1844‚Äì1910), later Lady Edgar, was president in 1906 and 1909. She was an accomplished historian and an influential feminist. President Winnifred Kydd was a delegate to the League of Nations. In 1930 Cairine Wilson of the Ottawa Council became the first woman to be appointed to the Senate. Each of The Famous Five (Emily Murphy, Irene Parlby, Nellie McClung, Louise McKinney, Henrietta Edwards) were members in the organization. and also Edith Archibald led the organization for a bit in the 1880s.

The film was made in the Dallas, Texas area, where it premiered. It was released to theaters in the Southwest in September 2008. Plot In Texas, Sergeant Archie Sparks, an MP, has finally caught up with AWOL Corporal Meredith Cole, who has been accused of assaulting a commanding officer. When Archie turns his back for a moment, Meredith manages to escape his custody once again. Cole finds herself on an American Auto Coach bus on her way to El Paso, along with an eclectic group of passengers for what should be an uneventful ride on Christmas Eve. The bus passes a group of meth- addicted, nomadic bikers who taunt the passengers by performing stunts around the bus. One of the bikers makes a mistake and ends up under the wheels of the bus, resulting in the rest of the bikers seeking revenge. The driver, Danny Gunn stops the bus to help, and when he gets out, one of the bikers kills him. Stray shots also wound Meredith and passenger Joey Ryan. Another passenger, Jerry Yarbro, a high school football coach who was accused of assaulting a student, retrieves the biker's weapon, while Walter Lindley, another passenger, retrieves Danny's keys. The surviving passengers drive away in the bus in an effort to get away from the bikers. As they flee down the highway, Joey dies from her injuries. The rest of the passengers include single mother Maudie McMinn, moody, wayward father Sam Cutter, tough woman Desiree, her extremely skittish boyfriend Duke, Annabel Drake a vegan who happens to be a competitive archer, and Ramon Vargas a Spanish-speaking electrician. At Jerry's insistence, they take the bus down a side road. The bikers force the bus off the road at an abandoned junkyard, where the bus crashes, killing Walter. The passengers build a makeshift bunker that the bikers surround. And Jerry, who seems to have anger management issues, still has the gun. The group is now on the defensive against the vengeful bikers. But they realize that in order to survive, they must go on the offensive and fight back against the bikers. That evening, they make a plan to hold out in the junkyard while Maudie, (a marathoner), crosses 20 miles of desert to reach the nearest town for help. As the remaining survivors fight back with captured guns, Annabel's target bow, and Ramon's jury-rigged cannon, Maudie gets away from the compound. Maudie meets up with Archie, and they kill some of the bikers. The two make it back to the compound during the middle of the confrontation, in which the remaining bikers injure Ramon and kill Duke, Desiree, and Jerry. After the remaining bikers are killed, the survivors‚ÄîSam, Meredith, Annabel, and Ramon‚Äîare driven to the nearest town by Maudie and Archie. Later, at a hospital, Maudie reunites with her daughters, and Meredith again evades the army, this time with Archie's help. Meredith joins Sam and Annabel as they head back out on the road in a minivan.

It was caused by the death of the incumbent Labour Party Member of Parliament Alex Wilson on 23 March of that year. Within days of Wilson's death, The Glasgow Herald described the by-election as 'the biggest battle the Government has faced in Scotland since the last General Election'. The SNP, which had previously won the seat in a by-election in 1967, were reported to see the contest as an important test of where political opinion in Scotland stood. The SNP's prospective candidate, Margo MacDonald, had a high profile as a former MP and had been working in the constituency for three years. There was also initial uncertainty as to whom Labour would select as a candidate. Wilson's death was unexpected and it had been assumed he would fight the seat at the next general election. John Maxton, nephew of James Maxton, who lived in the constituency, was suggested as a possibility, but he had already been selected to fight Glasgow Cathcart for Labour at the next election. As the opening game of the 1978 FIFA World Cup was on Thursday 1 June, the by-election was held one day earlier, on the Wednesday. All by- elections since then have been held on a Thursday. The Labour candidate was George Robertson, who defeated SNP candidate Margo MacDonald, with an increased majority. It was one of a series of significant Labour victories over the SNP in 1978 which halted their rise at that time.

In the first event, horse riding, Thofelt had drawn the lot for a very peculiar horse and eventually suffered from a concussion, after he fell off twice and had to withdraw.Bj√∂rn Thofelt. Swedish Olympic Committee Consequently, the Swedish team was not ranked. Hasse was also successful at the world championships. He won the team title in 1950, with Lars Hall and Thor Henning, and placed third in 1954, with √Öke Julin and Thofelt. Haase's home club was Studenternas Idrottsf√∂rening Stockholm. He completed an engineering study at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm with a focus on metallurgical and then worked in the metallurgical industry in Fagersta, where he resided until his death in July 2014.

It originates in the Kitimat Ranges, near the sources of the Dala River, Kemano River, Atna River, and Clore River. It flows in a curve north, then west, then south, emptying into Kitimat Arm at the head of Douglas Channel, at the town of Kitimat. The river is named after the original First Nations inhabitants of the river valley, the Gitamaat, which means \\"People of the Falling Snow\\" in the Tsimshian language. The Gitamaat people themselves are not Tsimshian but Haisla. Today the Haisla Nation is centered on Kitamaat Village, near the mouth of the Kitimat River. Course The Kitimat River originates from glacial meltwater on the northern slopes of Atna Peak. The area also feeds the headwaters of the Dala River, Atna River, Clore River, and Kemano River. The Kitimat River headwaters lie northwest of Atna River Provincial Park. The Kitimat flows north in a steep valley surrounded by glaciated mountains, such as Mount Davies and Davies Glacier. Davies Creek joins the Kitimat River just north of Mount Davies. Continuing north the Kitimat is joined by Hunter Creek, which collects glacial waters from high mountains such as Andesite Peak and Mount Clore. After this the Kitimat River turns to flow west, collecting various tributaries such as Tetlock Creek, McKay Creek, and Christ Creek. Christ Creek originates on the north side of Mount Clore. After the Christ Creek confluence the Kitimat River turns south as it enters the broad Kitimat Valley, which lies between the towns of Kitimat to the south and, Terrace on the Skeena River, to the north. The Stewart-Cassiar Highway, or Highway 37, runs between Terrace and Kitimat, parelling the Kitimat River after it enters the valley. As it flows south the Kitimat River is joins by Cecil, Deception, Humphrys, and Nalbeelah Creeks before meeting the Wedeene River, which flows from the northwest. The Wedeene River and its main headwater tributary, Aveling Creek, originate from glaciers on and around Wedeene Mountain, Mount Light, Mount Temple, and Mount Holt. Nalbeelah Creek Wetlands Provincial Park is located just southeast of the junction of the Kitimat River and Nalbeelah Creek. Just below the Wedeene River confluence the Kitimat River is joined from the west by the Little Wedeene River. The Little Wedeene River originates at Mount Madden. It drain many other high peaks such as Mount Clague. Just below the Little Wedeene River confluence the Kitimat River flows by Kitimat River Provincial Park. The Wedeene and Little Wedeene River basins lie just east of Gitnadoiks River Provincial Park. As the Kitimat River enters the outskirts of the town of Kitimat it is joined by Hirsch Creek, from the east. Finally the river flows through the town of Kitimat and by Kitimaat Indian Reserve 1, also known as Colichan Ground or Old Town, and is joined by Sumg√°s Creek, before emptying into Kitimat Arm by Minette Bay, the northernmost part of the long fjord Douglas Channel. The waters of Douglas Channel flow south to Wright Sound and on to Hecate Strait and the Pacific Ocean. History Formerly a small fishing village, the present municipal town of Kitimat was built in the 1950s by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan, now Rio Tinto Alcan) to support a large aluminum smelter. To power the smelter Alcan built Kenney Dam on the Nechako River, a 16 km (10 mi) tunnel to the Kemano Generating Station, and 82 km (51 mi) of transmission lines to Kitimat, where a deep sea terminal and smelter were built.

It is usually categorised as a New Woman novel.Cunningham, Gail: \\" 'He-Notes': Reconstructing Masculinity\\", The New Woman in Fiction and Fact, ed. Angelique Richardson and Chris Willis (Palgrave: Basingstoke and New York, 2001) 94-106. Plot introduction Set mainly in 1890s London and rural Surrey, Gallia is about a conventional aristocratic family with an unconventional daughter, who is the eponymous heroine of the story. However, Gallia does not openly rebel against society by, say, demanding equal rights for women or by deliberately breaking social rules. Rather, she leads a quiet, inconspicuous life, outwardly conforming to all the norms she is expected to observe. Her unconventionality is expressed in her unusual thoughts and ideas, in particular on human reproduction, which are given broad scope by the narrator. Thus, Gallia can be read as a philosophical novel. Plot summaryA chapter-by- chapter \\"Text Summary\\" is included in the 1995 edition, pp.215-222. Ever since their only child Gallia decided to get a university education about five years ago, Lord and Lady Hamesthwaite have been carefully watching their daughter's silent alienation from their world and have had their doubts if she will ever consent to marry one of the eligible young men that present themselves to the family. Gallia is attractive, healthy and clever but all the men around her agree that she never behaves in an easy-going, coquettish manner. Family and friends are occasionally shocked by the topics she chooses for polite conversation, such as politics or sex. Since her Oxford days, Gallia has known Hubert Essex, who has embarked on an academic career and does research on Darwinian theory. It is Essex with whom Gallia genuinely falls in love. Her honesty compels her to confess her love for him, and she is devastated when she is rejected by Essex. When he tells her bluntly that his \\"life has no need of\\" her,Gallia (1995 ed.), p.48. Gallia knows that she will never be able to experience romantic love again. What Essex omits from his speech is the fact that he is suffering from a hereditary heart condition and that he is very likely to die young. When Gallia is introduced to Mark Gurdon, an ambitious social climber who wants to get ahead within the British Civil Service, and when she realizes that he is handsome, healthy, and virile, she chooses him to be the father of her future child, or children. Gurdon, whose guiding principle in life is decency, is keeping a mistress in a studio flat in London who resorts to a self-induced abortion to terminate a pregnancy just at the time when Gurdon starts being attracted by Gallia. But Gallia does not mind: when he proposes to her, she accepts but makes it clear right from the start that she will never be able to love him. Eugenicist thought in GalliaFor a more thorough discussion of this point, cf. Sally Ledger: \\"The New Woman and Feminist Fictions\\", The Cambridge Companion to the Fin de Si√®cle, ed. Gail Marshall (CUP: Cambridge, 2007) 153ff. and L. Timmel Duchamp: \\"That Only a Feminist: Reflections on Women, Feminism and Science Fiction, 1818-1960\\" , Foundation: The International Review of Science Fiction (Vol.31, No.84, Spring, 2002). Gallia Hamesthwaite expounds her ideas on human reproduction, on \\"making better people\\" (i.e. eugenics), while having tea with her friend Margaret Essex--Hubert's sister--and a fashionable young woman called Gertrude Janion.Gallia, pp.112-116. Although she believes that her suggestion for social reform is utopian (\\"We shan't live to see the real advance\\"), she has worked it out in quite some detail: > \\"[...] How can we wonder that only one person in ten is handsome and well > made, when you reflect that they were most likely haps of hazard, that they > were unintended, the offspring of people quite unfitted to have children at > all? There are people fitted, for instance, to be mothers, which every woman > isn't; there are women fitted to bring up children, who may not be mothers. > Think of this: a man may love a woman and marry her; they may be devoted to > each other, and long for a child to bring up and to love; but the woman may > be too delicate to run the risk. What are they to do? What would be the > reasonable thing to do? Sacrifice the poor woman for the sake of a weakly > baby? No, of course not, but get in a mother!\\"Gallia, p.113. Gallia sees such a development (surrogacy) as \\"only a step farther\\" from employing a wet nurse, which was common practice among the rich in the late Victorian era. (In George Moore's novel Esther Waters (1894), the eponymous heroine works as a wet nurse after the birth of her son while leaving him in the hands of a baby farmer.) Strangely, Gallia, called \\"a shrewd and hopeful saint\\" by the narrator,Gallia, p.114. does not offer a more comprehensive social reform proposal. For example, she is not concerned with the plight of the lower classes; she does not even talk to her own domestic workers. (\\"Very seldom indeed had she occasion to address any of her servants, with the exception of her own footman and her maid. She was held in the awe with which all servants regard a mistress who is habitually unconscious of their existence.\\"Gallia, p.143.) Also, the female suffrage movement is not mentioned.

History   1850 - 1904  Stone City was founded in 1850 along the banks of the Wapsipinicon River. Early settlers discovered dolomite and limestone at the location. In its earliest history Stone City was known as the Anamosa Quarries. Later the area became known as the Stone City Quarries. In the late 1800s, Henry Dearborn, John Green, and John Ronen each opened limestone quarries in the area. As the railroad system expanded westward, distribution of limestone to bordering states increased. Stone City limestone became the primary building material for railroad bridges, bridge piers, and foundations for major buildings. Each year, between the years 1859 to 1895, over 150,000 railroad car shipments of limestone were sent from Stone City. Columbia Hall As the quarry business flourished, a city of stone emerged as hundreds of people settled in the area. First came a three-story, hotel and opera house complex known as Columbia Hall. It was completed in 1883 and made of 500,000 tons of stone. The theater offered some of the most well known entertainers of the day. By 1880 the population of Stone City reached five hundred.Jones County Iowa Biographies: John Aloysius Green Overlooking the town, Green built his twelve-room mansion containing seven Italian marble fireplaces, hand- painted murals, two baths, and a conservatory. Once the house was complete, Green erected more of the city ‚Äì a railway station, a post office, schoolhouse, a blacksmith shop, water tower, and several houses, all made of stone.  1905 - 1950  Stone City ruins In 1905 Portland cement began to be produced in Waterloo, Iowa. The use of Portland cement in place of quarried stone had an adverse effect on the economy of the Stone City and one by one the quarries began to shut down. During the next half century, nature reclaimed most of the quarries. Columbia Hall was purchased in the 1930s and torn down in 1938 to use the stone elsewhere. In 1963 the Green Mansion was tragically damaged by fire and torn down in the 1990s. Stone City was once the location of an art colony. In 1932, Grant Wood, Edward Rowan, and Adrian Dornbush established Stone City Art Colony. With little more than $100 and a number of promissory notes based on the success of the art colony they leased of land on the Green Estate. An area of of the estate had been purchased by Frank Nissen in 1920. The parcel of leased land included the Green Mansion, the Ice House and Water Tower. The upstairs portion of the house was converted into a dormitory. The rest of the house was used for business offices, kitchen, a sculpture studio and showers for the men. The basement of the ice house was made into a bar called The Sickle and Sheaf where instructor/student Dennis Burlingame tended bar. The upper portion of the water tower was converted into an apartment where Adrian Dornbush lived. It was called Adrian‚Äôs Tomb. The art colony failed. In terms of attendance and reputation the colony was a huge success. However, it was never a financial success.  1950 - present  Thanks to the vision of George Nissen (the developer of the modern trampoline) the original three-story Stone Barn, the Quarry Office, Water Tower and Ice House were preserved although they have been converted into private homes. The preservation of these structures, along with St. Joseph‚Äôs Catholic Church, Schoolhouse, General Store, Dearborn Residence, Blacksmith Shop and several other private homes has helped revitalize the town with new families without losing the charm of old Stone City. Many of the remaining buildings have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1952 the quarries underwent an economic revival under a new owner. The Stone City quarries have continued to grow and have become one of the largest quarries in the Midwest. The \\"Stone City quarries\\" now ship stone all over the United States. The stone from the banks of the Wapsipinicon River can be seen in both old and new construction, not just in Iowa, but across the United States. One of the most recent uses of this limestone can be seen in the new Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.  Geography  Stone City is located at (42.105427, -91.350196).

The painting is now on permanent display at Omaha's Joslyn Art Museum. Stone City, Iowa was Wood's first major landscape. The painting captures the sentiment Wood must have had for the area he lived all his young life. Although Wood did not include all of the buildings of Stone City at the time, many of the buildings featured in the painting still remain today. St. Joseph's Church, the general store, and the blacksmith shop are still there.

The microorganisms in the environment are essentially carrying out oxidation and reduction reactions, namely, oxidation of the organic contaminant coupled to the reduction of inorganic electron acceptors. The mechanism by which these bacteria (mainly denitrifiers, iron reducers, sulfidogens and methanogens, respectively) degrade the contaminants is different from aerobic bacteria because they cannot use oxygen to activate the stable hydrocarbon molecules. In contrast to humans, these bacteria are not dependent on oxygen as an electron acceptor for cellular respiration, but use molecules like nitrate, iron, sulfate and carbonate. During her early research in the Environmental Engineering Program at Stanford University her groups was the first to prove anaerobic oxidation of eleven aromatic lignin derivatives to methane by environmental bacteria. In 1994, Young's publication on Degradation of toluene and m-xylene and transformation of o-xylene by denitrifying enrichment cultures. (Appl Environ Microbiol 57:450‚Äì454) was noted as one of the 10 most highly cited papers in the field of Ecology and Environmental Sciences. At Rutgers, Professor Young has expanded her work to examine the anaerobic communities from NY-NJ Harbor sediments to degrade alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A major research goal is to determine the microbial chemistry of the anaerobic pathways of naphthalene, methylnaphthalene and phenanthrene. She was one of the first researchers to use stable isotope labeled compounds to decipher the mechanism of attack of hydrocarbons by anaerobes. This approach is now being widely used. By understanding the anaerobic biodegradation pathways, Young's group has developed methods to improve or enhance natural rates of biodegradation in the environment. This has led to the development of biochemical and biomolecular markers for assessing intrinsic biodegradation occurring in difficult to access groundwater aquifers. In keeping with her interest in microbial processes in the environment, recent work has also focused on the ability of environmental microorganisms to oxidize or to reduce hazardous metals such as arsenic. Through their ability to change the oxidation state of the metal ions the microorganisms can affect the fate and transport of the metals in aqueous habitats such as streams and groundwater.

English lesson A very young and attractive TV presenter introduces the English class for children, showing parts of the body, with the particulars in respect of English words. Among the parts of the body, there are also the breast and pussy. After the English lesson, she meets a man (Vittorio Gassman), who presents himself as an Italian secret agent. The man is came from the girl for a mission of the Italian Consulate: to kill the African ambassador, who's arrived in Italy for a conference with the themes of peace, brotherhood, and the war on racism. The woman takes revenge by killing the Italian spy after the murder.

The superintendent calls the army and firemen, making evacuate the entire building. Except for a very senior employee, who for three years has been waiting for retirement. While the boys team are acting inside the barracks defusing the bomb, the leaders of the direction realize that there is a mistake: no bomb is about to explode, because the ticking that caused the alarm comes from an alarm clock. The boss of the police station shall meet in a secret area of Rome with the fire chief. The two are not going to make a fool of in front of the Italian and European stamp, so plan to really blow up in the air the building of the police headquarters. The problem is that the men, having planted the bomb, badly synchronize the clocks, and they end up killed in the explosion.

One of the boys comes back home: his family consists of a mother pregnant and tired, that does not make she more to care for the dozens of children who gave birth. Her husband has left her, and it's up to the boy rewarded by the bishop, being the biggest, look after the little house. However, the young boy does not make him more alienating to live his life, and decides to kill himself by jumping from the balcony of the palace. Eating kids The event of the suicide of the Neapolitan child is picked up by a female journalist, who is holding a service on the theme of the great child poverty in Naples. As a guest in the transmission there is an Italian-German professor (Paolo Villaggio) who has a proposal to solve the problem. The man, looking through a satirical article of Jonathan Swift, says that the problem of overpopulation in Naples can be solved by eating babies. Proposing various methods to cook the children, the professor says that only poor children should be eaten, because they are more succulent. The four politicians Paolo T. Fiume invites to convenes on his tg four politicians of Naples, offering always the issue of poverty in the city, and its degradation both physical and cultural. The four men, hideous in the face and in speech, turn out to be each other relative, who shall be elected at each other in the various political offices of the big city.

The noble families of cardinals who are in fight the Piazza-Colonna and the Canareggio. Rome, 18th century: when the last pope dies of old age, the cardinals begin to quarrel among themselves. Two cruel bishops kill most of the Cardinals for not voting safe for the white smoke. One day the two cardinals decide a compromise: choose a puppet pope to agree on favors to be shared. The choice of papa puppet falls to the priest Felicetto Caprettari (Nino Manfredi), sick for years, which is now on the verge of death. The two bishops at the time convince him to get himself elected pope. When Felicetto is crowned in his room, in a heartbeat he comes back healthy and cured of all ills. The two bishops believe that it is a miracle, but in reality Felicetto reveals the two that he pretended to be sick for many years, waiting for the good chance to be crowned pope. Now that Felicetto is the Holy Father, order that the two cardinals are executed. His governorship, however, has no positive proposals for Church reform.

The presidents, senators, the honorable and the archbishops, all seniors who have passed a hundred years, applaud the government's exorbitant length of Giovanni Leone with a passionate speech: the spokesman of Pope Paul VI is a man so old that he can not to articulate complete sentences. At the end of the speech, all present applaud moved, persuaded to do good for the people of Italy, and with a wild dancing a Neapolitan mazurka.

It is part of the Technical College System of Georgia. Its main campus is The college serves Habersham, Stephens, Union, Fannin, White, Rabun, Towns, and Franklin counties. NGTC is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award associate degrees; it is also accredited by the Commission of the Council on Occupational Education. History North Georgia Technical College's Clarkesville Campus originally was the home of the Georgia Ninth District School of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts (The A&M;), which was active from 1907 until 1933. From 1938 to 1943, the campus was home of \\"Habersham College\\" and the National Youth Administration, one of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's programs during the Great Depression. Recognizing the need for occupational training for Georgians, the Georgia General Assembly created a vocational division in the State Board of Education, which approved a plan creating a system of state vocational schools in October 1943. The initial location for North Georgia Trade and Vocational School was chosen in 1943, and the school accepted its first student in February 1944. As the demand for technical training grew, more courses were added. In 1962, the name of the school was changed to North Georgia Technical and Vocational School. On July 1, 1985, North Georgia Tech was placed under the governance of the new state board, which today is called the Technical College System of Georgia. In 1987, the name was changed to North Georgia Technical Institute. The Clarkesville Campus of North Georgia Technical College is located in a mountain setting off Georgia Highway 197 one and one-half miles north of Clarkesville, the county seat of Habersham County. It is situated on 339 acres with the campus covering approximately 40 acres. It is 30 miles northeast of Gainesville, 50 miles north of Athens, Georgia, and 90 miles northeast of Atlanta off Interstate 85, Interstate 985 and Georgia Highway 365. As part of former Governor Zell Miller's pledge to bring a post-secondary institution within 40 miles of every Georgian, the 1995 legislative session appropriated 5.5 million dollars to build a state-of-the- art facility to be located on 25 acres along the Zell Miller Mountain Parkway just outside the town of Blairsville. Union County graciously donated the land on which the Blairsville Campus is located. The 45,000+ square foot facility was built on a knoll with a dramatic view of the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains. Classes began September 30, 1998, for the Blairsville Campus of North Georgia Technical Institute. On July 1, 2000, House Bill 1187 was made into law. This paved the way for Georgia's technical institutes to become technical colleges. North Georgia Technical Institute became North Georgia Technical College on October 10, 2000. Athletics For a period of time beginning in 2011, NGTC competed in intercollegiate cross country as a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association and the Georgia Collegiate Athletic Association. However, as of 2016 the official athletics page no longer discusses intercollegiate competition, and the GCAA does not include NGTC in its membership list.

Hemmeter, 64; His Opulent Resorts Transformed Hawaii Tourism Business\\", LA Times, 30 November 2016. Accessed 8 March 2016. Real estate development Christopher Hemmeter was born in 1939 in Washington, D.C. and grew up in Los Altos in the San Francisco Bay area. After attending Cornell University and graduating first in his class in 1962 he moved to Hawaii and got a job as a management trainee at the Sheraton Royal Hawaiian. Hemmeter's development career began in the 1960s when he partnered with Henry Shigekane and Diane Plotts to develop resorts in Hawaii. Projects he was involved with included developing the Westin Kauai, Hyatt Regency Waikiki, Hyatt Waikoloa and the Westin Maui. Hemmeter's signature \\"...is best known for the extreme - some would say outrageous - lavishness of the Hawaii hotels he built in the 1980's.\\" When the Westin Kauai opened in September, 1987, suites cost up to $1,800 and rooms ran double the island's average at $180 per night. The hotel was set in and boasted two golf courses and a reflecting pool, adding to the reported $775 million development cost. Former Hawaii Governor Ben Cayetano called Hemmeter, \\"...a man of great vision and energy, More than anyone else, he changed the nature of resort development in Hawai'i. The four- and five-star hotels on the Big Island and Maui are the products of his work.\\" In 1988 he ranked 389th on the Forbes Wealthiest American list. In September 1987 Hemmeter made a $100 million bid for Hawaiian Airlines which was accepted, but which was withdrawn in December of that year after the October 19th stock market crash. Casinos Hemmeter returned to the mainland in 1991 when he began to develop casino gaming projects. His biggest project was a proposed $1 billion casino in New Orleans. Billed at the time as \\"the world's largest casino\\". The original design resembled Monte Carlo's 1861 casino, intending to evoke the New Orleans 1885 Cotton Exposition and Chicago's 1893 World Columbia Exposition. The developers estimated the casino would attract one million additional visitors to the city and would generate annual revenues of as much as $780 million, estimates that were based in part on the proven success of dockside gaming in the Mississippi Gulf Coast area. In 1993 a partnership of Hemmeter and Caesars World obtained the lease on the Rivergate property, which by law was the only place the land-based casino could be built in Louisiana, beating out a rival bid by Harrah's. In August, 1993, however, the State Casino Board awarded the state's sole casino license to Harrah's and not the Hemmeter-Caesar's partnership. The impasse of one company owning the only license and another owning the only lease was resolved when the two entities formed a joint venture under pressure from then-Governor, Edwin Edwards. The new entity, known as \\"Harrah's Jazz\\" established a temporary casino in the Municipal Auditorium in order to establish a cash flow while the main facility was under construction at the Rivergate. The temporary facility opened in May, 1995 and a week later was closed due to a flood. The poor location of the site resulted in the actual gaming take falling 60% below projections at only $13.1 million per month. Equally concerning was the fact that 60% of gamers at the temporary facility were locals and not out-of-town tourists, undercutting the economic benefit backers hoped gaming to provide to the tourist industry. Harrah's Jazz halted construction on the permanent facility at 3 am the day before Thanksgiving, 1995 and laid off 1,600 construction workers, 2,500 casino employees, and filed for bankruptcy. Later, the project was taken over by Harrah's who built the Harrah's New Orleans Casino on the site of Hemmeter's project. He also saw failures of his New Orleans riverboat projects and Colorado gaming property, Bullwackers. Hemmeter filed personal bankruptcy in 1997. World Football League In 1974, Hemmeter was granted a franchise in the fledgling World Football League. This team, known as The Hawaiians, represented a serious attempt at a viable professional football organization. Hemmeter was one of the few owners who was reasonably well financed. After a financially disastrous first season, Hemmeter replaced league founder Gary L. Davidson as the league's commissioner. Hew proposed a plan of restructuring for the league which was known as the Hemmeter Plan. The plan was intended to bring a measure of fiscal sanity to the league. It restructured players' salaries to a $500 per game minimum with a profit sharing arrangement with the teams, and a fresh cash infusion from the team owners. Ultimately, those efforts were brought undone when a failed effort to sign Joe Namath for the Chicago Winds caused television partner TVS to back out. The lack of a national television contract, combined with the league's already damaged reputation, resulted in the league folding in the middle of the 1975 season.

History  The original Renaissance castle was erected from about 1590 onwards as a residence of count Bartholom√§us Khevenh√ºller (1539‚Äì1613), Freiherr of Landskron, who had served as ministerialis of the Inner Austrian archduke Charles II. Finished in 1603, the Khevenh√ºllers lost it already in 1629, when the Protestant dynasty was expelled from the Carinthian lands by Charles' successor, Emperor Ferdinand II, during the Thirty Years' War. Emperor Ferdinand III sold the castle to the Dietrichstein noble family in 1639. Devastated by a blaze in 1762, the remnants were uses as an inn and a postal station. The Dietrichsteins held the Velden estates until 1861. With tourism emerging on the Carinthian lakes in the late 19th century, Velden Castle was rebuilt in a Neo-Renaissance style and opened as a hotel in 1890. It soon became popular with celebrities and royalty. In 1990, the hotel reverted to being the private chateau of German industrialist Gunter Sachs.

Vongfong was a severe tropical storm that was active in August 2008. Vongfong originally formed on August 14 as a tropical depression to the south of Japan. The next morning Vongfong was upgraded to a tropical storm by both the JMA and the JTWC and then reached its peak intensity early the next morning and became extratropical at that strength early on August 18. Meteorological history Early on August 13, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, noted that an area of convection had persisted approximately to the southeast of Okinawa, Japan and designated it as a Tropical Disturbance. The JTWC at this time also assessed the disturbances chances of forming into a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours as fair. This was due to the tropical disturbance having a broad Low Level Circulation Center however the strongest winds were displaced on the eastern side of the disturbance. Early the next morning the JTWC reassessed the disturbances chances of forming into a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours as good and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the developing disturbance. This was because the Low Level Circulation Center had become well defined. Later on August 14, the Japan Meteorological Agency designated the tropical disturbance as a minor tropical depression whilst the JTWC also upgraded the disturbance and designated it as Tropical Depression 12W. Early the next day the JMA designated the depression as a full tropical depression, whilst the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm. Later that day the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, and assigned the name Vongfong to the storm. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center then reported that Vongfong had reached its peak winds of 50 knots (60 mph, 95 km/h1-Min) whilst it was located approximately to the southwest of Tokyo, Japan. The JMA also then reported that it Vongfong had reached its operational peak winds of 40 knots (45 mph 75 km/h 10-Min) however this was later revised in its best track when the JMA upgraded Vongfong peak winds to 50 knots (60 mph 110 km/h 10-Min). Later on August 15, the JTWC reported that Vongfong had started to weaken from its peak. During the next day Vongfong carried on weakening. The JTWC then issued its final warning on Vongfong later that day as it had begun its extratropical transition. whilst the JMA kept issuing warnings on Vongfong until early on August 17 when they downgraded it to an extratropical low. The extratropical low of Vongfong then crossed the International Dateline and moved out of the JMA's area of responsibility and moved into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility but they did not issue any warnings on Vongfong as it was extratropical. Impact and naming As Vongfong brushed by Japan, heavy rains triggered flood which killed one person. A total of 523 homes and 39 hectares (96.3 acres) were damaged by the storm and 15,520 people were left without power. The storm also damaged 139 roads and caused 54 landslides. The name \\"Vongfong\\" was one of the 10 original names submitted by Macau to the WMO's Typhoon Committee for use from January 1, 2000. Vongfong was last used in the 2002 Pacific typhoon season and is the Macau word for wasp.

This event attracted nationwide attention, mainly due to the perception that the assailants had been given special treatment by the school and local authorities due to their status as local football stars. The events were later documented in a book and TV movie. Incident The assault occurred on March 1, 1989. The victim left her house the afternoon of the incident to go play basketball in Carteret Park. On the way, she found a stick which she decided to keep. When she arrived at the park, many of the school's athletes were there, either watching or participating in an informal baseball practice. One of the boys came over to her and asked her to come down to a basement of a nearby house for a party. The house was adjacent to the park and the owners were in Florida, with only the grandmother being home at that time. After initially refusing, she agreed when she was told that the boy's brother (whom she had a crush on) would go on a date with her. He put his arm around the victim and escorted her to the basement. When they reached the basement, 12 boys from the park were there. After some conversation, one of the boys removed his pants and underpants and the victim removed her shirt. At this point, a sophomore and another underclassman left. A total of six boys left while the victim undressed. Seven boys stayed, all football players and all seniors but one. The victim was then orally raped. She was forced to bend over and the boys took turns vaginally penetrating her. The victim was then penetrated with a broom by two of those present and she was penetrated with a baseball bat. The broom and bat were covered with plastic bags coated with Vaseline. At one point during the rape, one of the athletes passively suggested that they stop. After it was over, she promised not to tell, then waited outside the house for a long time, waiting for the promised date, which never happened. A number of boys later attempted to get the victim to come down to the basement a second time to repeat the incident. The first staff member to report the incident was a teacher who overheard a student discussing the rumors with a classmate. The student had been asked earlier to videotape a planned second incident (which never took place). The vice principal then called the police on March 22, three weeks after the assault occurred. Police interviewed the vice principal and the victim's swim coach, the latter of whom had heard about the incident from the victim herself three days after the incident. Detective Lieutenant Richard Corcoran put Detective Sheila Byron in charge of investigating the case. Byron's main focus was to establish if the victim had given consent, or whether she was incapable of giving consent. During her interviews with the victim, it became clear to Byron that the victim did not completely understand what had happened to her, so she would not have known she could say no. During the investigation, it became clear that the victim still wanted the athletes to like her and that she did not want to get them in trouble. Byron realized she would need independent corroboration, because the victim might not make a convincing witness in a trial. The prosecutor's office officially became involved with the investigation on April 7 and officially took control on April 12. First public reports The first public report of the incident was on May 23, 1989, by the local NBC station WNBC-TV. Over the next few days the story was picked up in newspapers across the United States and Canada. The New York Times and Washington Post ran their first articles regarding the incident on May 25, 1989, the same day the story was picked up by newspapers in Lewiston, MaineStudents arrested, The Lewiston Journal - May 25, 1989 and Spokane, Washington.Additional arrests possible after assault on mentally retarded girl, Spokane Chronicle - May 25, 1989 The Los Angeles Times first carried the story in its paper on May 26, 1989 and the Toronto Star became the first foreign newspaper to carry the story, also on May 26, 1989, the same day the story hit newspapers in northern AlabamaSexual assault case leaves town divided, Gadsden Times - May 26, 1989 and Tampa Bay, Florida. Trial, verdict and appeals After a twenty-three-week-long trial from 1992 to 1993, Christopher Archer and Kevin Scherzer were convicted in 1993 of a second- degree count of conspiracy and two first-degree counts of aggravated sexual assault with the bat and broom. Kyle Scherzer was found guilty of second- degree conspiracy, first-degree aggravated sexual assault by use of force or coercion and second-degree attempted aggravated sexual assault. Bryant Grober was convicted of a single third-degree conspiracy charge. (First-degree aggravated sexual assault is how rape is prosecuted in New Jersey.) Christopher Archer, Kevin Scherzer and Kyle Scherzer were all sentenced to a maximum of 15 years in a \\"young adult offenders\\" prison. Bryant Grober was sentenced to three years of probation and two hundred hours of community service. All three defendants were granted bail pending appeal.Lefkowitz, page 417 On appeal, the convictions for the minor offenses were reversed, but the convictions for the major offense of first-degree aggravated sexual assault were upheld, with Kyle Scherzer's sentence being reduced to seven years. All three began serving their sentences in 1997. In 2004, after all three had served their prison sentences, they again appealed their convictions to try to clear their names and to stay off New Jersey's sexual offender registry. The convictions were upheld.  Our Guys  Book Bernard Lefkowitz wrote a book about the Glen Ridge Rape called Our Guys: The Glen Ridge Rape and the Secret Life of the Perfect Suburb. The book attributes many of the problems with the football players to their society's (as well as the town's and the parents') heavy emphasis on winning and success rather than on personal character. The book was later adapted into a TV movie. Television film The events of the Glen Ridge Rape were adapted into a television movie called Our Guys: Outrage at Glen Ridge, which premiered on ABC in 1999, is occasionally shown on Lifetime and was subsequently released on DVD.https://www.amazon.com/Our-Guys-Region-Eric-Stoltz/dp/B000TMDAWE The film, directed by Guy Ferland, stars Ally Sheedy, Eric Stoltz and Heather Matarazzo and is an adaptation of Bernard Lefkowitz's book. The rape scene of the film was toned down due to the film being on broadcast television. Some of the things described in Lefkowitz's book were left out of the film. The film renamed several characters and invented some new ones. The film also altered the time-line of events, moving the time of the rape being reported in the Fall (it is football season and the film opens on homecoming night), when in reality, the rape was reported in the Spring. ;Characters * Detective Kelly Brooks (Ally Sheedy) * Prosecutor Robert Laurino (Eric Stoltz) ‚Äî Stoltz also narrates a brief summary of the later lives of some of the characters at the film's end. * Leslie Faber (Heather Matarazzo), a pseudonym assigned to the victim by Bernard Lefkowitz * Ros Faber (Sara Botsford) * Paul Archer (Scott Vickaryous) ‚Äî In the film, he suggests to his friends that they stop, although Kyle Scherzer is actually responsible for this suggestion during the real-life incident. * Lt.

This fruit is popular in Taiwan, where it is known as the \\"pineapple sugar apple\\" (È≥≥Ê¢®ÈáãËø¶), so is sometimes wrongly believed to be a cross between the sugar-apple and the pineapple. In Cuba it is known as an√≥n, and in Venezuela chirimorinon. In Israel and Lebanon, the fruit is called achta, but in Israel it is more common to call the fruit annona as Latin. In Tanzania it is called stafeli dogo (\\"mini soursop\\"). In Brazil, the atemoya became popular and in 2011, around 1,200 hectares of atemoia were cultivated in Brazil. An atemoya is normally heart-shaped or rounded, with pale-green, easily bruised, bumpy skin. Near the stem, the skin is bumpy as it is in the sugar-apple, but become smoother like the cherimoya on the bottom. The flesh is not segmented like that of the sugar-apple, bearing more similarity to that of the cherimoya. It is very juicy and smooth, tasting slightly sweet and a little tart, reminiscent of a pi√±a colada. The taste also resembles vanilla from its sugar-apple parent. Many inedible, toxic, black seeds are found throughout the flesh of the atemoya. When ripe, the fruit can be scooped out of the shell and eaten chilled. Atemoya fruit Atemoya (Annona cherimola √ó squamosa) was developed by crossing cherimoya (A. cherimola) with sugar-apple (A. squamosa). Natural hybrids have been found in Venezuela and chance hybrids were noted in adjacent sugar apple and cherimoya groves in Israel during the 1930s and 1940s. The first cross was made in 1908 by P.J. Wester, a horticulturist at the USDA's Subtropical Laboratory in Miami. The resulting fruits were of superior quality to the sugar-apple and were given the name \\"atemoya\\", a combination of ate, an old Mexican name for sugar-apple, and \\"moya\\" from cherimoya. Subsequently, in 1917, Edward Simmons at Miami's Plant Introduction Station successfully grew hybrids that survived a drop in temperature to , showing atemoya's hardiness derived from one of its parents, the cherimoya. The atemoya, like other Annona trees, bears protogynous, hermaphroditic flowers, and self-pollination is rare. Therefore, artificial, hand pollination almost always guarantees superior quality fruits. One variety, 'Geffner', produces well without hand pollination. 'Bradley' also produces fair crops without hand pollination, but the fruit has a habit of splitting on the tree. Atemoyas are sometimes misshapen, underdeveloped on one side, as the result of inadequate pollination. An atemoya flower, in its female stage, opens between 2:00 and 4:00 pm; between 3:00 pm and 5:00 pm on the following afternoon, the flower converts to its male stage.  Cultivars  * Gefner: It is a very productive Israeli cultivar and is the most satisfactory variety under Florida conditions, and does not require hand pollination (in Florida) and produces fruit of good quality. The fruits reach 450 grams and are well-formed. The carpels are narrow and pointed. The pulp is white, juicy and resistant, that is, it does not allow the passage of a spoon.

It was cut from the production during the Washington D.C. tryout on the orders of producer Florenz Ziegfeld, supposedly because it was one of the factors that made the show too long (it ran four-and-a-half hours when it premiered). However, musical theatre historian Miles Kreuger and conductor John McGlinn, also suggest that it was the dark, dramatic tone of the piece that most concerned Ziegfeld. Kern was reportedly so incensed by the deletion of \\"Mis'ry's Comin' Aroun\\" that he made it the principal motif of Show Boat's original overture and asked orchestrator Robert Russell Bennett to work sections of it into the background music as well, where it is now played by the orchestra during some of the dialogue scenes involving the mixed race actress Julie La Verne. The song, which runs about five minutes, is an African-American lament of foreboding and impending doom sung by Queenie, the cook, and the African-American chorus, and, in the show, drives Julie, who has been passing as white, to near hysteria. It is supposed to be sung at the beginning of the rehearsal scene, which contains the sequence in which Julie and her white husband are revealed to be guilty of \\"miscegenation\\" by the local sheriff, who tries to arrest them. A fragment of the song's slow section is still actually sung by the black chorus during the scene, as well as in the 1936 film version of the show, but it does not build up to the fever pitch that Kern and Hammerstein originally conceived. In the 1951 film version of the show, an offscreen chorus hums the slow section of the song as Julie and Steve leave the boat, but the words are not sung. The song is not heard at all in the 1929 part-talkie film version. The complete song was not restored to the show's score until EMI's exhaustive1988 3-CD recording of the show's score with its original lyrics, orchestrations and vocal arrangements, and performed onstage complete for the first time since the Washington D.C. tryout of Show Boat when producer Harold Prince included it in the 1994 Broadway revival.IBDB: The official source for Broadway Information References 1927 songs Songs with music by Jerome Kern Songs with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II ","title":"Mis'ry's Comin' Aroun"},{"id":"19149659","text":"The Kimlin Cider Mill is located on the east side of Cedar Avenue in the Town of Poughkeepsie, on approximately two acres of land.

For most of the 20th century, the Kimlin Cider Mill operated as a producer and retail outlet for apple cider. Its popularity with local residents, particularly the area's schoolchildren and students from nearby Vassar College, prompted Ralph R. Kimlin to embellish the exterior of the building and to create indoor spaces for the enjoyment of his customers. The property surrounding the Mill soon became a park.

Of his many notable achievements, his appointment in 1957 by US President Dwight D. Eisenhower to chair the credit committee of the Drought Conference in Wichita, Kansas, was one of his proudest. Thompson's commitment to farmers and ranchers in dire financial circumstances gained him the nickname of \\"Mr. Farm Credit\\". In 1971 he pushed his way onto the national scene by taking a leading role in getting the Farm Credit Act passed. This led to his being named \\"Man of the Year in Texas Agriculture\\" in 1972 by Progressive Farmer magazine. Further, his involvement as a Director of the Texas Electric Service Company proved to be instrumental in the subsequent building of Lake Colorado City. Charles Thompson was appointed by Texas Governor James B. Allred in 1937, to serve on the board of directors of Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University). In 1958, Texas Tech awarded him an honorary doctorate and a dormitory was named in his honor. The university honored him again in 1978 by establishing the Charles C. Thompson Professorship in Agricultural Finance through the College of Agricultural Sciences. Later life and family In addition to his involvement with helping Jesus, Charles was also interested in developing his local farm, church, and army. With his eye on growth he served as President of the Colorado City Chamber of Commerce for five years and served for over twenty- five years on various committees of the West Texas Chamber of Commerce.

He sent out a letter personally endorsing Huckabee. Because the letter was on church stationery, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began investigating Drake for possibly endorsing a political candidate as a church leader, because electioneering by churches is forbidden as a condition for churches' tax-exempt status. Drake's possible violation of federal tax law was reported to the IRS by an advocacy group called Americans United for Separation of Church and State (AU). Drake called on supporters to use imprecatory prayer to pray for the punishment and even deaths of certain AU members, drawing controversy. In May 2008, Drake announced that he had been cleared of any wrongdoing by the IRS.

Barnard developed the library collection systematically, seeking guidance from noted intellectuals including writer and lexicographer Dr. Samuel Johnson.British Library Birth and parentage Frederick Augusta Barnard was the son of John Barnard (‚Ä†1773), a Gentleman Usher, Quarterly Waiter and Page of the Backstairs to Frederick, Prince of Wales. His mother was Elizabeth Smith, who had married John Barnard at Berwick Street Chapel, St James, Westminster, in 1740/1.The Gentleman's Magazine (1741) p. 108 Barnard was born 1 September 1743 and was baptised at St James, Westminster, 30 September 1743,Family History Library microfilm 1,042,308 (providing the date of birth), quoted in Anthony Camp, Royal Mistresses and Bastards: Fact and Fiction 1714‚Äì1936 (2007) p. 45 and was almost certainly a godson of the Prince and his wife Princess Augusta of Saxe-Coburg.E.M. Paintin in The Dictionary of National Biography: missing persons (1993) p. 43, and in Oxford Dictionary of National Buiography (2004) When Barnard died (1830), The Gentleman's Magazine stated 'He was presumed to be a natural son of Frederick, Prince of Wales', a statement repeated in the same magazine in 1834,The Gentleman's Magazine vol.1 (1834) repeated in Edward Edwards, Lives of the founders of the British Museum (1870), page 468, and several subsequent reference works,e.g. R.A. Austen- Leigh, ed., Eton College Register: 1750‚Äì1790 (1921) and J.A. Venn, ed. Alumni Cantabrigiensis, Part II, vol. 1 (1940), p. 158 and perpetuated by a descendant, the herald James Arnold Frere, in his The British Monarchy at home (1963), pages 42, 45 and 139. The claim, not based on any earlier record, seems to have originated in the belief that Barnard was Prince Frederick's son by his mistress Anne Vane, the daughter of Lord Barnard, as has been stated by one genealogist,Gerald Paget, The lineage and ancestry of H.R.H. Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, vol. 1 (1977) p. 38, note 3 but since Anne died in 1736, that is not possible. That he was the son of John Barnard is proved by the latter's will, dated 2 April 1772, which quotes the terms of his marriage settlement, dated 26 June 1741, which made provision of ¬£5,000 for his wife if she survived him, and then for her children. The will states 'whereas my late wife has departed this life leaving three children by her body by me (viz) the said Elizabeth Barnard and Frederick Augusta Barnard and Mary Barnard now all living\\". The will further mentions related orders of the Court of Chancery on 24 February 1762 when Samuel Wright was ordered to pay ¬£5,000 to the Accountant General (John's wife Elizabeth having presumably died), and on 28 June 1768 when application was successfully made for the funds, all the children having attained their majorities. The ¬£5,000 was then bequeathed to the three children, the son receiving less than the daughters, he \\"being happily provided for in his Majesty's service\\".The National Archives, PROB11/989 folio 279, quoted in Anthony Camp, Royal Mistresses and Bastards: Fact and Fiction (2007) p. 45 Early career Barnard's introduction to royal service was as Page of the Backstairs to George III, appointed to that post on 26 December 1760.J.C.

The library that George III inherited consisted of a few collections scattered among the various royal residences. Early in his reign George determined to start a new library worthy of a monarch, and reflecting his patronage, taste and power. As a first step, he acquired in 1763 the library of Joseph Smith, former British Consul at Venice. Smith's collection contained many classics that were important examples of early printing. Starting around this period George delegated buyers to attend all major book sales in London and the Continent. Single volumes, private collections and large numbers of books from Jesuit libraries that had closed down, found their way to London and the new library. George continued enlarging his library for some fifty years. He acquired the best books at the auctions of West, Ratcliffe and Askew, and continued buying up to the Roxburghe sale of 1812. Messrs Nicol, the booksellers, were his usual agents, though he retrieved from the Continent some priceless incunabula through Horn of Ratisbon, a notorious plunderer of the German convents. This collection, which came to be known as the King's Library, held numerous volumes on classical, English and Italian literature, European history and religion, and had examples of early printing, including a copy of the Gutenberg Bible, and William Caxton's first edition of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. The collection included less-scholarly material, such as current magazines and newspapers. Numerous manuscripts and bound volumes of maps and topographical views rounded off the collection. The library had grown to some 65 000 volumes and 19 000 pamphlets by the time of George's death (1820). A policy was eventually instituted of making the library's resources freely available to scholars, but initially George regarded the collection as his personal property and only grudgingly allowed access to Joseph Priestley and the American revolutionary John Adams, though Samuel Johnson was always welcomed. The collection was first housed in the Old Palace at Kew, then was moved to the Octagon Library which had been specially constructed at the Queen's House or Buckingham House, on the site of the present Buckingham Palace. Here it remained until George IV, after his father's death in 1820, decided to rebuild Buckingham House into a suitable palace for himself. George IV had little interest in the library, and he donated it to the British public in 1823. Catalogue For a long time George III had wanted a catalogue of the collection published, but kept postponing this. It became evident after 1812 that he would not recover from his condition, and Queen Charlotte and the Prince Regent urged that the catalogue be finalised. Barnard compiled and published it as Bibliothecae Regiae Catalogus printed by W. Bulmer & W. Nicol of London between 1820 and 1829 in five folio volumes. Although it was never offered for sale to the public, copies were presented to the crowned heads of Europe and important libraries in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Later life Barnard had been elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1789 and a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1790. He was distressed to witness the dispersal of the collection he had helped to assemble, but he was made Knight Commander of the Order of the Guelphs (Knight of Hanover, or K.C.H.) in 1828.William A.

Overview Prior to consuming any food or beverage, a Jew must recite a blessing to express his or her gratitude to God for providing sustenance; additionally, because the entire world is believed to be in the possession of the Almighty, specific praise must be offered to God prior to deriving benefit. There are different blessings for each of the different halachic food groups: * bread * other grain products * wine and grape juice * fruit and nuts * vegetables * all other foods and drinks When an individual eats two foods together, one of which is primary and the other of which is subsidiary to it, only one blessing is recited, as stated in B.Mishna Berachot 6:7, \\"Whenever a primary food [ikar] is accompanied by a subsidiary food [tafel], the blessing is recited on the primary food, exempting the subsidiary food.\\" While the laws governing this principle are complex, some of its basic rules are straightforward. It pertains only to foods eaten in a combined form. One who has a cookie and tea must make two blessings, one on each of the items. It is when one is eating something akin to apple pie, beef stew or stuffed cabbage, which are foods consisting of multiple parts (crust and pie, beef and potatoes or meat and cabbage, respectively) that the principle of ikar v'tafel is applied (Aruch Hashulchan 212:1, 2).

The server desktop application organizes video, audio, and photos from a user's collections and from online services, enabling the players to access and stream the contents. There are official clients available for mobile devices, smart TVs, and streaming boxes, a web app, and Plex Home Theater (no longer maintained), as well as many third-party alternatives. Free Plex accounts can share their personal media libraries among a user's own collection of devices or to friends, and access Plex's content library of ad- supported video on demand (AVOD). Plex Pass is the optional paid-subscription service including synchronization with mobile devices, cloud storage integration, metadata fetching for music, support for multiple users, parental controls, live TV and DVR, trailers, extras, and cross-selling offers. In 2019, Plex began global streaming of free ad-supported video on demand (AVOD), with TV shows and movies from distributors such as Crackle, Warner Bros., MGM, Endemol Shine Group, Lionsgate, and Legendary.  History  Plex began as a freeware hobby project in December 2007 when developer Elan Feingold created a media center application for his Apple Mac. He ported the media player XBMC (now known as Kodi) to Mac OS X. Around the same time, Cayce Ullman and Scott Olechowskisoftware executives who had recently sold their previous company to Ciscowere also looking to port XBMC to OSX, and noticed Feingold's progress via XBMC online forums. They contacted him and offered support and funding, forming a three-person team in January 2008. The team released early versions of the port, called OSXBMC, intended for eventual full integration into Mac OS X. The developers continued collaborating with the Linux-based XBMC project until May 21, 2008. Due to different goals and vision from the XBMC team, they soon forked the code to become Plex, and published it on GitHub. The OSXBMC code was kept roughly in sync with the upstream XBMC code. In December 2009 the US-based Plex, Inc. was founded with Ullman as CEO and Feingold as CTO. At that time, Plex had 130 apps, the most popular of which were viewers for Apple Movies Trailers, YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, MTV Music Videos, BBC iPlayer, and Vimeo. Feingold declared Plex apps had been downloaded about 1 million times. , Plex had 65 employees.

As early as fourth grade, Sampson dreamed of one day being a writer. By the time he reached fifth grade, he had read every book in the Tom Bean library. He had written a series of books featuring Frank and Joe of The Hardy Boys fame, and even had a poem published in a national magazine.

He also played cricket for Surrey between 1876 and 1882. Career Early life and education Lindsay was born in Benares, India, the son of Major William Lindsay of the 10th Regiment. His father and most of his family were killed during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 at the Siege of Cawnpore. In 1858 he was admitted to Winchester College as one of three boys orphaned by the Indian Mutiny and remained at the college until 1865. At school he was a keen sportsman and played cricket for the Commoners XI between 1862 and 1864, as well as for the school football team. In 1860, he won the school wide jump competition and was second in the 100 yards. In 1863, he won both the high jump and the wide jump, followed by the high jump with pole in 1864 and the sack race the following year. Football career Lindsay subsequently represented the Old Wykehamists before joining the Wanderers in 1875, now aged 28. Lindsay played for Scotland in all five of the unofficial internationals against England in 1870, 1871 and 1872, which were played at Kennington Oval before the first official international match played on 30 November 1872. He qualified for Scotland as his father was born in Dundee in 1810; his grandfather had been Provost of Dundee. His first appearance for the Wanderers was against Clapham Rovers on 2 October 1875 and he went on to make eight appearances that season, including five in the FA Cup run, where Wanderers reached the Cup Final played against Old Etonians at the Oval on 11 March 1876. The match finished 1‚Äì1 after extra time. John Hawley Edwards scored for Wanderers; Alexander Bonsor got Old Etonians' equalising goal. Wanderers won the replay 3‚Äì0, with two goals from Thomas Hughes and one by Charles Wollaston. The following season he again turned out regularly for the Wanderers, making a total of seven appearances, including three matches in another successful FA Cup campaign, as Wanderers again reached the final to be played against Oxford University. Three weeks prior to the Cup Final he was one of seven debutants in the England team to play Scotland at the Kennington Oval on 3 March 1877. According to Philip Gibbons, in the 1870s the England side \\"tended to be chosen on availability rather than skill alone\\" The change in the England line-up made little difference to England's performance against the Scots who won the game 3‚Äì1, with England's consolation goal coming from Alfred Lyttelton; the Scots thus inflicted England's first international defeat on home soil in the sixth appearance between the two countries. Lindsay, along with four of the international debutants, was never selected again for international honours. In the 1877 FA Cup Final, played against Oxford University at the Oval on 24 March, Arthur Kinnaird conceded an own goal to enable Oxford University to take the lead. A few minutes from time, the Wanderers equalised when Jarvis Kenrick slotted home a goal after a pass from Hubert Heron. The game finished level after 90 minutes; in extra time, Wanderers proved too strong for their opponents when Lindsay's initial shot was headed back to him by an Oxford defender. Following in, Lindsay was able to steer the ball past the keeper for the winning goal. In 1877‚Äì78, Lindsay appeared for Wanderers in the later stages of their FA Cup campaign, as they reached the final for the third consecutive year, and the fifth time in the first seven years of the competition. The Final against the Royal Engineers was played at the Kennington Oval on 23 March. Wanderers won 3‚Äì1, with two goals by Jarvis Kenrick and one by Arthur Kinnaird. Wanderers were thus the cup winners for the third consecutive year; as a result, the Football Association awarded the Wanderers the cup outright ‚Äì the offer was declined in a \\"highly sporting and honourable gesture\\" on condition that it could never be won outright. Lindsay continued to turn out occasionally for the Wanderers until January 1880, when he was part of the side who were defeated 3‚Äì0 by Old Etonians in what turned out to be the Wanderers final FA Cup appearance. During his football career, he also played for Crystal Palace, Civil Service, Gitanos and South Norwood as well as playing representative football for Surrey. Cricket career At Winchester, he played for the school cricket eleven in 1864 and 1865. He joined Surrey in 1876, and in his seven seasons with the county he scored 987 runs at an average of 17.31. His highest innings was 74 against Middlesex at the Oval in 1877. He also played cricket for Devon. Life outside sport In 1867 he started work as a junior clerk in the store department of the India Office and from 1877 to 1881 was private secretary to the Under-secretary of State, and in 1882 became Senior Clerk. He was private secretary to Lord George Hamilton, Hon. Edward Stanhope, the Marquess of Lansdowne and Viscount Enfield before he retired in 1900. He was married to Emily (who was four years older than he was), and they had a daughter, Lilias, and a son, William. Lindsay died at his home in Rochester, Kent on 15 February 1923.

At its opening in 1956, it was the largest regional shopping center in Virginia. The backsplit two-story mall structure was razed in the mid-1990s and replaced with a dual ground level power center. History The 45-store, $25 million, center, developed by Kass-Berger of Washington, D.C., formally opened October 4, 1956, on a parcel at the intersection of Arlington Boulevard (U.S. Route 50) and Leesburg Pike (State Route 7).\\"7-Corners Center Holds Preview,\\" by Jack Eisen, The Washington Post and Times Herald, Sep 19, 1956, p. 16.\\"Ceremony To Be Brief At Opening,\\" The Washington Post and Times Herald, Oct 3, 1956, p. 38. At opening, the store was anchored by Washington D.C.-based department stores Julius Garfinckel & Co. and a Woodward & Lothrop. The center also included a Food Lane supermarket; Woolworth's; Bond Stores, Franklin Simon & Co., Joseph R. Harris Co., Peck & Peck, and Wilson's Mens Store clothing stores; Mayer & Company furniture; Thom McAn and Hahn's Shoes; Fanny Farmer candy; and Western Auto as well as a Peoples Drug Store, which featured stores on both the upper and lower concourses (connected via a staircase). It also included the first cafeteria in northern Virginia, an S&W; Cafeteria. When opened, the center employed nearly 1,000.\\"New Center Employs Nearly 1000,\\" The Washington Post and Times Herald, p. 42. A Raleigh's joined the center sometime after its opening, as did a Varsity Shop men's clothing outlet and a Brentano's book store. Seven Corners has always been a major bus stop and bus terminal. The stop was originally located outside the Garfinckel's on the lower level, then moved to the upper level next to the central escalators until the building was redesigned. Today, the bus stop sits near its original lower level location, at a transit station constructed by Fairfax County. The main building was shaped like an \\"I\\" with two anchors at either end and two wide promenades connecting. The center was built on a hillside in a split level design with escalators connecting the two levels. Heating and cooling were by water from an underground lake located beneath the center.\\"7 Corners Shopping Center Open for Business Thursday,\\" by Jack Eisen, The Washington Post and Times Herald, Oct 3, 1956, p. 37. The center prospered through the 1980s. With competition from a growing number of regional malls in the area compounded by the bankruptcy of Garfinckel's in 1990, closing of Raleigh's & and Woodward & Lothrop in 1995. \\"Garfinckel's Casts a Shadow On D.C. Dream,\\" by David S Hilzenrath, The Washington Post, Jun 25, 1990, p. E1 As the indoor mall lost relevance, Seven Corners fell victim to vacancy and disrepair. Most of the original center was demolished in the mid-1990s and replaced with a big-box style power center. As a result, Seven Corners is no longer an enclosed single shopping center, but essentially two outdoor strip malls. Instead of using interior promenades, shoppers must walk along the parking lot to go from store to store. The two levels are no longer connected by escalators; there is only a narrow exterior metal and concrete stairway at one end of the complex, which is rarely used by shoppers. The Garfinckel's now occupied by a Ross Dress for Less is the only portion of the original Seven Corners Center still standing. Once reopened, the new two level complex anchor stores included Shoppers Food Warehouse, Home Depot, Best Buy, Service Merchandise, and Barnes & Noble.Dead Malls dot Com entry (retrieved Sep 2, 2008).Fairfax County EDA - Doing Business in Fairfax County, Seven Corners (retrieved Sep 2, 2008) . Around 2003, Best Buy moved out and was replaced by RoomStore which closed in late 2012. The Service Merchandise store was replaced by Syms, which also closed in late 2011. The Shoppers grocery store will be closed and converted to Giant Food in mid-2019, as part of the eventual closing of all Shoppers stores. The center was the site of one of the Washington, D.C. Beltway sniper attacks in 2002. It is currently managed by Saul Centers of Bethesda, Maryland.

Outside North America, the word pants generally means underwear and not trousers. Shorts are similar to trousers, but with legs that come down only to around the area of the knee, higher or lower depending on the style of the garment. To distinguish them from shorts, trousers may be called \\"long trousers\\" in certain contexts such as school uniform, where tailored shorts may be called \\"short trousers\\", especially in the UK. The oldest known trousers were found at the Yanghai cemetery in Turpan, Xinjiang, western China and dated to the period between the 10th and the 13th centuries BC. Made of wool, the trousers had straight legs and wide crotches and were likely made for horseback riding. In most of Europe, trousers have been worn since ancient times and throughout the Medieval period, becoming the most common form of lower-body clothing for adult males in the modern world. Breeches were worn instead of trousers in early modern Europe by some men in higher classes of society. Distinctive formal trousers are traditionally worn with formal and semi-formal day attire. Since the mid-20th century, trousers have increasingly been worn by women as well. Jeans, made of denim, are a form of trousers for casual wear widely worn all over the world by both sexes. Shorts are often preferred in hot weather or for some sports and also often by children and adolescents. Trousers are worn on the hips or waist and are often held up by buttons, elastic, a belt or suspenders (braces). Unless elastic, and especially for men, trousers usually provide a zippered or buttoned fly. Jeans usually feature side and rear pockets with pocket openings placed slightly below the waist band. It is also possible for trousers to provide cargo pockets further down the legs. Maintenance of fit is more challenging for trousers than for some other garments. Leg-length can be adjusted with a hem, which helps to retain fit during the adolescent and early adulthood growth years. Tailoring adjustment of girth to accommodate weight gain or weight loss is relatively limited, and otherwise serviceable trousers may need to be replaced after a significant change in body composition. Younger women sometimes opt for skin-tight slim- fit pants where maintenance of fit is an ongoing challenge. Terminology In Scotland, trousers are occasionally known as trews, which is the historic root of the word trousers. Trousers are also known as in Scots, a word related to breeches. The item of clothing worn under trousers is underpants. The standard form trousers is also used, but it is sometimes pronounced in a manner approximately represented by , as Scots did not completely undergo the Great Vowel Shift, and thus retains the vowel sound of the Gaelic from which the word originates. In North America, Australia, South Africa and North West England pants is the general category term, whereas trousers (sometimes slacks in Australia and the United States) often refers more specifically to tailored garments with a waistband, belt-loops, and a fly-front. In these dialects, elastic-waist knitted garments would be called pants, but not trousers (or slacks). North Americans call undergarments underwear, underpants, undies, or panties (the last are women's garments specifically) to distinguish them from other pants that are worn on the outside. The term drawers normally refers to undergarments, but in some dialects, may be found as a synonym for \\"breeches\\", that is, trousers. In these dialects, the term underdrawers is used for undergarments. Many North Americans refer to their undergarments by their type, such as boxers or briefs. In Australia, men's underwear also has various informal terms including under-dacks, undies, dacks or jocks. In New Zealand men's underwear is known informally as undies or dacks. The words trouser (or pant) instead of trousers (or pants) is sometimes used in the tailoring and fashion industries as a generic term, for instance when discussing styles, such as \\"a flared trouser\\", rather than as a specific item. The words trousers and pants are pluralia tantum, nouns that generally only appear in plural form‚Äîmuch like the words scissors and tongs, and as such pair of trousers is the usual correct form. However, the singular form is used in some compound words, such as trouser-leg, trouser-press and trouser-bottoms. Jeans are trousers typically made from denim or dungaree cloth. Skin-tight leggings are commonly referred to as tights.  Types  There are several different main types of pants and trousers, such as dress pants, jeans, khakis, chinos, leggings, and sweatpants. They can also be classified by fit, fabric, and other features. There is apparently no universal, overarching classification. History Roman Bronze Statuette of a Suebi wearing trousers. First to 3rd century AD. Prehistory There is some evidence, from figurative art, of trousers being worn in the Upper Paleolithic, as seen on the figurines found at the Siberian sites of Mal'ta and Buret'. The oldest known trousers were found at the Yanghai cemetery, extracted from mummies in Turpan, Xinjiang, western China, belonging to the people of the Tarim Basin; dated to the period between the 13th and the 10th century BC and made of wool, the trousers had straight legs and wide crotches, and were likely made for horseback riding. Antiquity Scythian wearing trousers Trousers enter recorded history in the 6th century BC, on the rock carvings and artworks of Persepolis,Pictures show Achaemenid costumes including trousers. http://persianwondersvideo.blogspot.com.au/ and with the appearance of horse- riding Eurasian nomads in Greek ethnography. At this time, Iranian peoples such as Scythians, Sarmatians, Sogdians and Bactrians among others, along with Armenians and Eastern and Central Asian peoples such as the Xiongnu/Hunnu, are known to have worn trousers.Payne, Blanche. History of Costume. Harper & Row, 1965. pp. 49‚Äì51 Trousers are believed to have been worn by both sexes among these early users.Lever, James (1995, 2010). Costume and Fashion: A Concise History.

Costume and Fashion: A Concise History. Thames and Hudson, 1995, 2010. p. 50. As the Roman Empire expanded beyond the Mediterranean basin, however, the greater warmth provided by trousers led to their adoption.Payne, Blanche (1965). History of Costume.

Both garments were adopted originally from the Celts of Europe, although later familiarity with the Persian Near East and the Teutons increased acceptance. Feminalia and Braccae both began use as military garments, spreading to civilian dress later, and were eventually made in a variety of materials including leather, wool, cotton and silk.Lever, James (1995, 2010). Costume and Fashion: A Concise History. Thames and Hudson. p. 40. Parthians of Palmyra wearing baggy trousers, current Syria, Dura Europos 240 dC Medieval Europe Trousers of various designs were worn throughout the Middle Ages in Europe, especially by men. Loose-fitting trousers were worn in Byzantium under long tunics,Payne, Blanche. History of Costume. Harper & Row, 1965. p. 124 and were worn by many tribes, such as the Germanic tribes that migrated to the Western Roman Empire in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages, as evidenced by both artistic sources and such relics as the 4th-century costumes recovered from the Thorsberg peat bog (see illustration).Payne, Blanche. History of Costume. Harper & Row, 1965. Pp. 136‚Äì138 Trousers in this period, generally called brais, varied in length and were often closed at the cuff or even had attached foot coverings, although open-legged pants were also seen.Lever, James.

Psalter (the 'Shaftesbury Psalter') with calendar and prayers Origin England Date 2nd quarter of the 12th century By the 8th century there is evidence of the wearing in Europe of two layers of trousers, especially among upper-class males.Payne, Blanche. History of Costume. Harper & Row, 1965. p. 142 The under layer is today referred to by costume historians as \\"drawers\\", although that usage did not emerge until the late 16th century. Over the drawers were worn trousers of wool or linen, which in the 10th century began to be referred to as breeches in many places. Tightness of fit and length of leg varied by period, class, and geography. (Open legged trousers can be seen on the Norman soldiers of the Bayeux Tapestry.)Payne, Blanche. History of Costume. Harper & Row, 1965. pp. 142, 154 Although Charlemagne (742‚Äì814) is recorded to have habitually worn trousers, donning the Byzantine tunic only for ceremonial occasions,Einhard. The Life of Charlemagne. University of Michigan Press, 1960.Lever, James. Costume and Fashion: A Concise History. Thames and Hudson, 1995, 2010. pp. 50‚Äì51. the influence of the Roman past and the example of Byzantium led to the increasing use of long tunics by men, hiding most of the trousers from view and eventually rendering them an undergarment for many. As undergarments, these trousers became briefer or longer as the length of the various medieval outer garments changed, and were met by, and usually attached to, another garment variously called hose or stockings. In the 14th century it became common among the men of the noble and knightly classes to connect the hose directly to their pourpointsPayne, Blanche. History of Costume.

In the 15th century, rising hemlines led to ever briefer drawersLever, James. Costume and Fashion: A Concise History. Thames and Hudson, 1995, 2010. p. 58. until they were dispensed with altogether by the most fashionable elites who joined their skin-tight hose back into trousers.Payne, Blanche. History of Costume. Harper & Row, 1965. p. 207 These trousers, which we would today call tights but which were still called hose or sometimes joined hose at the time, emerged late in the 15th century and were conspicuous by their open crotch which was covered by an independently fastening front panel, the codpiece. The exposure of the hose to the waist was consistent with 15th-century trends, which also brought the pourpoint/doublet and the shirt, previously undergarments, into view,Payne, Blanche. History of Costume. Harper & Row, 1965. p. 200 but the most revealing of these fashions were only ever adopted at court and not by the general population. Men's clothes in Hungary in the 15th century consisted of a shirt and trousers as underwear, and a dolman worn over them, as well as a short fur-lined or sheepskin coat. Hungarians generally wore simple trousers, only their colour being unusual; the dolman covered the greater part of the trousers. Europe before the 20th century Around the turn of the 16th century it became conventional to separate hose into two pieces, one from the waist to the crotch which fastened around the top of the legs, called trunk hose, and the other running beneath it to the foot. The trunk hose soon reached down the thigh to fasten below the knee and were now usually called \\"breeches\\" to distinguish them from the lower-leg coverings still called hose or, sometimes stockings. By the end of the 16th century, the codpiece had also been incorporated into breeches which featured a fly or fall front opening. As a modernisation measure, Tsar Peter the Great of Russia issued a decree in 1701 commanding every Russian man, other than clergy and peasant farmers, to wear trousers. During the French Revolution of 1789 and following, many male citizens of France adopted a working-class costume including ankle-length trousers, or pantaloons (named from a Commedia dell'Arte character named Pantalone)Italian Culture in the Drama of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries, ed. Michele Marrapodi 2007 in place of the aristocratic knee-breeches (culottes). (Compare sans-culottes.) The new garment of the revolutionaries differed from that of the ancien regime upper classes in three ways: * it was loose where the style for breeches had most recently been form-fitting * it was ankle length where breeches had generally been knee-length for more than two centuries * they were open at the bottom while breeches were fastened Pantaloons became fashionable in early 19th-century England and the Regency era. The style was introduced by Beau Brummell (1778‚Äì1840) and by mid-century had supplanted breeches as fashionable street-wear. At this point, even knee- length pants adopted the open bottoms of trousers (see shorts) and were worn by young boys, for sports, and in tropical climates. Breeches proper have survived into the 21th century as court dress, and also in baggy mid-calf (or three-quarter length) versions known as plus-fours or knickers worn for active sports and by young schoolboys. Types of breeches are also still worn today by baseball and American football players, and by equestrians. Sailors may have played a role in the worldwide dissemination of trousers as a fashion. In the 17th and 18th centuries, sailors wore baggy trousers known as galligaskins. Sailors also pioneered the wearing of jeans - trousers made of denim. These became more popular in the late 19th century in the American West because of their ruggedness and durability. Starting around the mid-19th century, Wigan pit-brow girls scandalised Victorian society by wearing trousers for their work at the local coal mines. They wore skirts over their trousers and rolled them up to their waists to keep them out of the way. Although pit-brow lasses worked above ground at the pit-head, their task of sorting and shovelling coal involved hard manual labour, so wearing the usual long skirts of the time would have greatly hindered their movements. Medieval Korea The Korean word for trousers, baji (originally pajibaji) first appears in recorded history around the turn of the 15th century, but pants may have been in use by Korean society for some time. From at least this time pants were worn by both sexes in Korea. Men wore trousers either as outer garments or beneath skirts, while it was unusual for adult women to wear their pants (termed sokgot) without a covering skirt. As in Europe, a wide variety of styles came to define regions, time periods and age and gender groups, from the unlined gouei to the padded sombaji.Lee, Kyung Ja, and Hong Na Young and Chang Sook Hwan, translated by Shin Jooyoung. Traditional Korean Costume. Global Orient, 2003. p. 231. Women wearing trousers See also the \\"Laws\\" section below in this article. Amazon wearing trousers and carrying a shield with an attached patterned cloth and a quiver. Ancient Greek Attic white-ground alabastron, c. 470 BC, British Museum, London In Western society, it was Eastern culture that inspired French designer Paul Poiret (1879‚Äì1944) to be one of the first to design pants for women. In 1913, Poiret created loose-fitting, wide-leg trousers for women called harem pants, which were based on the costumes of the popular ballet Sheherazade. Written by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in 1888, Sheherazade was based on a collection of legends from the Middle East called 1001 Arabian Nights. In the early 20th century women air pilots and other working women often wore trousers. Frequent photographs from the 1930s of actresses Marlene Dietrich and Katharine Hepburn in trousers helped make trousers acceptable for women. During World War II, women employed in factories or doing other \\"men's work\\" on war service wore trousers when the job demanded it. In the post-war era, trousers became acceptable casual wear for gardening, the beach, and other leisure pursuits. In Britain during World War II the rationing of clothing prompted women to wear their husbands' civilian clothes, including trousers, to work while the husbands men were serving in the armed forces. This was partly because they were seen as practical for work, but also so that women could keep their clothing allowance for other uses. As this practice of wearing trousers became more widespread and as the men's clothing wore out, replacements were needed. By the summer of 1944, it was reported that sales of women's trousers were five times more than the previous year. In 1919, Luisa Capetillo challenged mainstream society by becoming the first woman in Puerto Rico to wear trousers in public. Capetillo was sent to jail for what was considered to be a crime, but the charges were later dropped. In the 1960s, Andr√© Courr√®ges introduced long trousers for women as a fashion item, leading to the era of the pantsuit and designer jeans and the gradual erosion of social prohibitions against girls and women wearing trousers in schools, the workplace and in fine restaurants. In 1969, Rep. Charlotte Reid (R-Ill.) became the first woman to wear trousers in the US Congress. Pat Nixon was the first American First Lady to wear trousers in public. In 1989, California state senator Rebecca Morgan became the first woman to wear trousers in a US state senate. Hillary Clinton was the first woman to wear trousers in an official American First Lady portrait. In Rome in 1992, a woman's jeans became a central issue in a rape case. A 45-year-old driving instructor was accused of rape. When he picked up an 18-year-old girl for her first driving lesson, he allegedly raped her for an hour, then threatened to kill her if she reported the crime. Later that night she told her parents, who sought to press charges. While the alleged rapist was convicted and sentenced, the Italian Supreme Court overturned the conviction in 1998 because the victim wore tight jeans. It was argued that she must have necessarily have had to help her attacker remove her jeans, thus making the act consensual (\\"because the victim wore very, very tight jeans, she had to help him remove them...and by removing the jeans...it was no longer rape but consensual sex\\"). The Italian Supreme Court stated in its decision ‚Äúit is a fact of common experience that it is nearly impossible to slip off tight jeans even partly without the active collaboration of the person who is wearing them.‚Äù This ruling sparked widespread feminist protest. The day after the decision, women in the Italian Parliament protested by wearing jeans and holding placards that read ‚ÄúJeans: An Alibi for Rape.‚Äù As a sign of support, the California Senate and Assembly followed suit. Soon Patricia Giggans, Executive Director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, (now Peace Over Violence) made Denim Day an annual event. As of 2011 at least 20 U.S. states officially recognize Denim Day in April. As of 2008 the Italian Supreme Court has overturned their findings, and there is no longer a \\"denim\\" defense to the charge of rape. Women were not allowed to wear trousers on the US Senate floor until 1993. In 1993, Senators Barbara Mikulski and Carol Moseley Braun wore trousers onto the floor in defiance of the rule, and female support staff followed soon after, with the rule being amended later that year by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Martha Pope to allow women to wear trousers on the floor so long as they also wore a jacket. In Malawi women were not legally allowed to wear trousers under President Kamuzu Banda's rule until 1994.Sarah DeCapua, Malawi in Pictures, 2009, pg 7. This law was introduced in 1965. Since 2004 the International Skating Union has allowed women to wear trousers instead of skirts in ice skating competition. In 2009, journalist Lubna Hussein was fined the equivalent of $200 when a court found her guilty of violating Sudan's decency laws by wearing trousers. In 2012 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police began to allow women to wear trousers and boots with all their formal uniforms. In 2012 and 2013, some Mormon women participated in \\"Wear Pants to Church Day\\", in which they wore trousers to church instead of the customary dresses to encourage gender equality within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Over one thousand women participated in 2012. In 2013, Turkey's parliament ended a ban on women lawmakers wearing trousers in its assembly. Also in 2013, an old bylaw requiring women in Paris, France to ask permission from city authorities before \\"dressing as men\\", including wearing trousers (with exceptions for those \\"holding a bicycle handlebar or the reins of a horse\\") was declared officially revoked by France's Women's Rights Minister, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem. The bylaw was originally intended to prevent women from wearing the pantalons fashionable with Parisian rebels in the French Revolution. In 2014, an Indian family court in Mumbai ruled that a husband objecting to his wife wearing a kurta and jeans and forcing her to wear a sari amounts to cruelty inflicted by the husband and can be a ground to seek divorce. The wife was thus granted a divorce on the ground of cruelty as defined under section 27(1)(d) of Special Marriage Act, 1954. Until 2016 some female crew members on British Airways were required to wear British Airways‚Äô standard \\"ambassador\\" uniform, which has not traditionally included trousers. In 2017, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced that its female employees could wear \\"professional pantsuits and dress slacks\\" while at work; dresses and skirts had previously been required. In 2018 it was announced that female missionaries of that church could wear dress slacks except when attending the temple and during Sunday worship services, baptismal services, and mission leadership and zone conferences.https://www.wsbradio.com/news/national/female-mormon-missionaries- given-option-wear-dress-slacks/3JvcGA9xS8XaSPLDJZAaJI/ In 2019, Virgin Atlantic began to allow its female flight attendants to wear trousers. Parts of trousers Parts of trousers Pleats Pleats just below the waistband on the front typify many styles of formal and casual trousers, including suit trousers and khakis. There may be one, two, three, or no pleats, which may face either direction. When the pleats open towards the pockets they are called reverse pleats (typical of most trousers today) and when they open toward the fly they are known as forward pleats. Cuffs Trouser-makers can finish the legs by hemming the bottom to prevent fraying. Trousers with turn-ups (cuffs in American English), after hemming, are rolled outward and sometimes pressed or stitched into place. Fly A fly is a covering over an opening join concealing the mechanism, such as a zipper, velcro or buttons, used to join the opening. In trousers, this is most commonly an opening covering the groin, which makes the pants easier to put on or take off. The opening also allows men to urinate without lowering their trousers. Trousers have varied historically in whether or not they have a fly. Originally, hose did not cover the area between the legs. This was instead covered by a doublet or by a codpiece. When breeches were worn, during the Regency period for example, they were fall-fronted (or broad fall). Later, after trousers (pantaloons) were invented, the fly-front (split fall) emerged.Croonborg, Frederick: The Blue Book of Men's Tailoring. Croonborg Sartorial Co. New York and Chicago, 1907. p. 123 The panelled front returned as a sporting option, such as in riding breeches, but is now hardly ever used, a fly being by far the most common fastening. Most flies now use a zipper, though button-fly pants continue to be available. Trouser support At present, most trousers are held up through the assistance of a belt which is passed through the belt loops on the waistband of the trousers. However, this was traditionally a style acceptable only for casual trousers and work trousers; suit trousers and formal trousers were suspended by the use of braces (suspenders in American English) attached to buttons located on the interior or exterior of the waistband. Today, this remains the preferred method of trouser support amongst adherents of classical British tailoring. Many men claim this method is more effective and more comfortable because it requires no cinching of the waist or periodic adjustment. Society In modern Western society, males customarily wear trousers and not skirts or dresses. There are exceptions, however, such as the ceremonial Scottish kilt and Greek fustanella, as well as robes or robe-like clothing such as the cassocks of clergy and the academic robes, both rarely worn today in daily use. (See also Men's skirts.)Convertible Ventilated Trousers shown with one leg cover removed Based on Deuteronomy 22:5 in the Bible (\\"The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man\\"), some groups, including the Amish, Hutterites, some Mennonites, some Baptists, a few Church of Christ groups, and most Orthodox Jews, believe that women should not wear trousers. These groups permit women to wear underpants as long as they are hidden. By contrast, many Muslim sects approve of pants as they are considered more modest than any skirt that is shorter than ankle length. However, some mosques require ankle length trousers for both Muslims and non-Muslims on the premises. Among certain groups, low- rise, baggy trousers exposing underwear became fashionable; for example, among skaters and in 1990s hip hop fashion. This fashion is called sagging or, alternatively, \\"busting slack.\\" Cut-offs are homemade shorts made by cutting the legs off trousers, usually after holes have been worn in fabric around the knees. This extends the useful life of the trousers. The remaining leg fabric may be hemmed or left to fray after being cut. Laws France In 2013, a law requiring women in Paris, France, to ask permission from city authorities before \\"dressing as men\\", including wearing trousers (with exceptions for those \\"holding a bicycle handlebar or the reins of a horse\\") was declared officially revoked by France's Women's Rights Minister, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem.

Turkey In 2013, Turkey's parliament ended a ban on women lawmakers wearing trousers in its assembly. Sudan In Sudan, Article 152 of the Memorandum to the 1991 Penal Code prohibits the wearing of \\"obscene outfits\\" in public. This law has been used to arrest and prosecute women wearing trousers. Thirteen women including journalist Lubna al-Hussein were arrested in Khartoum in July 2009 for wearing trousers; ten of the women pleaded guilty and were flogged with ten lashes and fined 250 Sudanese pounds apiece. Lubna al-Hussein considers herself a good Muslim and asserts \\"Islam does not say whether a woman can wear trousers or not. I'm not afraid of being flogged. It doesn't hurt. But it is insulting.\\" She was eventually found guilty and fined the equivalent of $200 rather than being flogged. United States In May 2004, in Louisiana, Democrat and state legislator Derrick Shepherd proposed a bill that would make it a crime to appear in public wearing trousers below the waist and thereby exposing one's skin or \\"intimate clothing\\". The Louisiana bill did not pass. In February 2005, Virginia legislators tried to pass a similar law that would have made punishable by a $50 fine \\"any person who, while in a public place, intentionally wears and displays his below-waist undergarments, intended to cover a person's intimate parts, in a lewd or indecent manner\\". (It is not clear whether, with the same coverage by the trousers, exposing underwear was considered worse than exposing bare skin, or whether the latter was already covered by another law.) The law passed in the Virginia House of Delegates. However, various criticisms to it arose. For example, newspaper columnists and radio talk show hosts consistently said that since most people that would be penalised under the law would be young African-American men, the law would thus be a form of racial discrimination. Virginia's state senators voted against passing the law. In California, Government Code Section 12947.5 (part of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA)) expressly protects the right to wear pants. Thus, the standard California FEHA discrimination complaint form includes an option for \\"denied the right to wear pants.\\" See also * Capri pants * Churidar * Clothing sizes * No Pants Day * Open-crotch pants * Oxford bags * Pantalettes * Low-rise pants * Pantsuit * Thai fisherman pants * Trouser clips References External links (video) Etymology of 'Pants', from Mysteries of Vernacular History of clothing (Western fashion) History of fashion ","title":"Trousers"},{"id":"19150141","text":"In the picture titled \\"Dancing boy\\" (Î¨¥Îèô:ËàûÁ´•), several types of Korean drums are depicted.

In the traditional Korean classification of instruments, drums are grouped with the hyeokbu (ÌòÅÎ∂Ä, ), or instruments made with leather. A notable class of these leather drums are Korean barrel drums History During the Joseon period, many types of drums were used for the royal court music, including the janggu, jwago, yonggo, gyobanggo, jingo, jeolgo, nogo, and others.

The wrapping of the statue of Will Rogers and Soapsuds, by the Saddle Tramps, is a prominent tradition at Texas Tech. Music The Goin' Band from Raiderland is the 450-member marching band of Texas Tech University. The Goin' Band's repertoire of performance music varies widely, ranging from traditional marches to jazz pieces to the works of Elton John and Carlos Santana. The Goin' Band makes use of both traditional-style marching (formations moving goal-line to goal-line) and corps-style (formations while playing to the sidelines) in its performances. The Goin' Band also incorporates some of the tactics of scramble bands. Mascots The Masked Rider The Masked Rider statue The Masked Rider, Texas Tech's primary mascot, dates back to a 1936 prank. George Tate borrowed a horse from the Texas Technological College Dairy Barn and led the football team onto the field. This was done a few more times during the 1936 season but was not seen again for 17 years. At the Gator Bowl on January 1, 1953, Texas Tech student Joe Kirk Fulton, riding Blackie, rushed onto the field ahead of the football team. The crowd sat in stunned silence before bursting into applause. At that game, The Masked Rider became the official mascot of Texas Tech and the first mascot in major college sports featuring a live horse. The Masked Rider wears a black gaucho hat, a black mask, and a scarlet rider's cape. From its inception to 1974, the rider was always a male student. Ann Lynch's selection as the first female rider caused controversy at the university. Today, the student serving in the role is selected by the Masked Rider Advisor Committee after a written test, preliminary screening and equestrian skills tryout period. Lyndi Starr, a senior agricultural communications major will serve as the 57th Masked Rider for the 2018-19 academic year. In 2000, a sculpture by artist Grant Speed was unveiled to commemorate the tradition. That statue is 25 percent larger than real life. It sits outside the university's Frazier Alumni Pavilion. Raider Red Raider Red. Texas Tech's other mascot, Raider Red, is a more recent creation. Beginning with the 1971 football season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school did not want to allow the Masked Rider's horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the Saddle Tramps student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist Dirk West, a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor. Though the Masked Rider's identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure. The student serving as Raider Red is a member of the Saddle Tramps or High Riders. Campus  Will Rogers & Soapsuds  Will Rogers and Soapsuds statue One of the most well-known landmarks on campus is the statue of Will Rogers on his horse Soapsuds. The statue, created by Electra Waggoner Biggs, has resided at the center of the campus since it was dedicated on February 16, 1950 by Rogers' longtime friend Amon G. Carter. Carter claimed that Texas Tech was the ideal setting for the statue and that it would be an appropriate addition to the traditions and scenery of West Texas. The statue, estimated to cost (in 1950) $25,000, stands and weighs 3,200 pounds (1,450 kg). The inscription on the plaque at the base of the statue reads: \\"Lovable Old Will Rogers on his favorite horse, 'Soapsuds', riding into the Western sunset.\\" A campus legend holds that the statue was originally intended to be positioned with Will Rogers facing due west, so that it would appear he was riding into the sunset. However, that position would cause Soapsuds' posterior to face due east, towards the main entrance of the school. The horse's rear would also be facing downtown Lubbock, potentially insulting the Lubbock business community. Though proven apocryphal, legend states the statue was turned 23 degrees to the east, causing Soapsuds' rear to face in the direction of College Station, Texas, home of rival Texas A&M; University to address the aforementioned issue. Blarney Stone On Saint Patrick's Day in 1939, Texas Tech President Clifford B. Jones and Engineering Society President Dosh McCreary unveiled the Blarney Stone monument which sits in front of the old Electrical Engineering Building. The stone on the monument was said to have been discovered on March 7, 1939, by a group of petroleum engineers on a field trip. It was reported at the time that the stone had been found to be \\"identical with a piece of the original Blarney Stone which disappeared from Blarney Castle...in 1659\\". How this was determined is unknown. Double T Bench The seniors of the class of 1931 donated the Double T Bench, a bench in the shape of Texas Tech's Double T logo. The bench is located in the courtyard behind the Administration Building. It is an announced tradition that no freshmen are allowed to sit on it. Songs The Matador Song Fans displaying the Guns Up hand sign The Matador Song was written by Harry Lemaire and R.C. Marshall. Lemaire was band director at Tech from 1925‚Äì34. He composed the music. Marshall, editor of the La Ventana, wrote the words in 1930. The words and title represent Texas Tech's original athletic teams' name of Matadors. It is the school's alma mater and is sung at athletic events and occasions such as Commencement. Fight, Matadors, for Tech! Songs of love we'll sing to thee, Bear our banners far and wide. Ever to be our pride, Fearless champions ever be. Stand on heights of victory. Strive for honor evermore. Long live the Matadors!  Fight, Raiders, Fight  Fight, Raiders, Fight, Texas Tech's fight song, was written by Carroll McMath, and updates the Matadors, Tech's original name for the athletic teams, to the Red Raiders. The spirited song is sung at many of Tech's sporting events. Fight, Raiders, Fight! Fight, Raiders, Fight! Fight for the school we love so dearly. You'll hit 'em high, you'll hit 'em low. You'll push the ball across the goal, Tech, Fight! Fight! We'll praise your name, boost you to fame. Fight for the Scarlet and Black. You will hit 'em, you will wreck 'em. Hit 'em, Wreck 'em, Texas Tech! And the Victory Bells will ring out. Events Arbor Day Each spring, Texas Tech students gather to plant flowers and new trees on campus in an effort to beautify the campus. The tradition began in 1937 when President Knapp dedicated the day. The first Arbor Day was hosted by the Saddle Tramps, students and faculty planted 20,000 trees. Carol of Lights Carol of Lights The Carol of Lights is held annually to celebrate the holiday season at the university. The event begins with the Texas Tech University Combined Choirs singing classic holiday songs at the Science Quadrangle and the Saddle Tramps carrying torches to light the way. This is followed by the lighting ceremony, where students and others witness the illuminating of the over 25,000 red, white, and orange lights decorating the 13 buildings surrounding Memorial Circle. The tradition traces its beginnings to 1959 when Harold Hinn designed the plan and provided the funding to cover the Science Quadrangle and Administration building with lights. However, students were away on Christmas break and did not see the display. So, the following year, the Residence Hall Association created the Christmas Sing, which became known as the Carol of Lights. The Carol of Lights is now one of Texas Tech's favorite traditions. Homecoming Texas Tech homecoming is held each fall. It began in 1930 at a game where the football lost, 20‚Äì6, to Hardin‚ÄìSimmons. During the annual celebration, Tech-exes and fans join with students for a bonfire, built by the Saddle Tramps, and pep rally, parade, open houses, awards programs, and float competitions. A highlight of the event is election of a queen, the first being Suzanne Matteson in 1954. RaiderGate RaiderGate is an officially sanctioned student tailgating event that takes place on campus and begins four hours before each home football game. A typical event draws nearly 10,000 students. Live music acts play on stage as students and guests barbecue, socialize, and participate in games hosted by various student organizations. Texas Tech's Student Government Association hosts the event. Raider Walk Since the 2010 season, a tradition called \\"Raider Walk\\" gives Red Raider fans the chance to greet the football team as the team arrives at the stadium prior to the game. The Raider Walk starts exactly two hours and 15 minutes prior to kickoff at all home football games at Jones AT&T; Stadium. The team busses will drop off the team and coaching staff there at the intersection of Canton Avenue and Drive of Champions (the corner of Dan Law Field at Rip Griffin Park and the City Bank Auditorium) and will proceed down Drive of Champions in front of the Frazier Alumni Pavilion and all the way to the football training facility, just east of the Athletic Training Center (ATC).http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/083010aaa.html Raider Walk was predicated by \\"Red Raid\\" a similar team walk event that took place during the 2003 season. For the 2013 football season, Head Coach, Kliff Kingsbury discontinued the raider walk.http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/102803aac.html Spirit organizations Saddle Tramps Saddle Tramps is a spirit/social organization at Texas Tech University. Founded in 1936, it is the oldest student organization on campus. During that year, while Texas Tech was very young and establishing its identity, a group of students Arch Lamb, Paul \\"Grandma\\" Bowers and Bud Thompson observed that the school spirit was being channeled in the wrong direction. The student body was overly exuberant and unorganized. Lamb conceived the idea of an organization that would lead this enthusiastic spirit into constructive channels. It was decided that Saddle Tramps should be a non-political organization dedicated to the improvement and advancement of Texas Tech as well as service and leadership to the university and student body. Early Texas ranchers would hire a \\"saddle tramp\\" on the basis of his ability and willingness to tackle any task assigned to him. He would move on after some time, having done all he could to contribute to the improvement of the ranch. It was from this idea that Lamb named the group as he did. The first men selected were the top ones in each college of the university. Each of these men chose others who he thought would make the best members. The projects of Saddle Tramps have included such things as rallying freshmen at athletic events, supervising the planting of 20,000 trees on campus in 1938 and raising money to buy the first forty band uniforms. They played a major role in obtaining the fountain and seal, which is located at the Broadway Street entrance to campus. In the spring of 1990, Saddle Tramps established the Saddle Tramp Student Endowment Scholarship Fund and donated money to the renovation of the Tech Dairy Barn the following year. Saddle Tramps are known for wrapping the Will Rogers & Soapsuds \\"Riding into the Sunset\\" statue in red crepe paper before each home football game. The statue is also wrapped in black crepe paper to mourn national tragedies. The victory bells are rang by the Saddle Tramps for thirty minutes after every home football, men's basketball, and baseball win; whenever a Tech team wins a Big 12 championship; whenever a Tech athlete is selected as an All-American; and after every Tech graduation. Saddle Tramps also construct the Homecoming bonfire and conduct a torchlight parade at the beginning of the bonfire as well as the Carol of Lights. Saddle Tramp Jim Gaspard created the university's costumed mascot Raider Red, based on a character by Dirk West. During the tenure, the identity of the person playing Raider Red is unknown to everyone but the Saddle Tramps. Prospective members receive a bid after attending rush week at the beginning of each semester. Membership is limited to 100 actives and pledges.Saddle Tramps - About A Saddle Tramp must have an active and working knowledge of Texas Tech, its history, schools and colleges, location of buildings, and staff in order that he be better prepared to answer questions of visitors and of fellow students and also for his own information. It is also necessary for him to know the history of the Saddle Tramp organization in order to help him better understand the purpose of the organization and his duties as a Saddle Tramp. High Riders High Riders is a spirit organization at Texas Tech University. It is dedicated to promoting unity and support for all women's athletics at the school. The High Riders take part in parades and campus events throughout the year to endorse the Lady Raiders. They also hold the distinction of being the only people, along with the Saddle Tramps, allowed in the bell tower of the Administration Building to ring the Victory bells after each Lady Raider home victory.High Riders - About The organization dates to 1975 and traces its roots to Nancy Neill. After attending a Saddle Tramps meeting, she discovered there had been several failed attempts to organize a women's organization to support Texas Tech's women athletes. She decided that, with better planning, she could create a lasting group to fill the gap. On February 2, 1976, the High Riders were accepted as an official campus organization. They began work immediately and, the following fall, 75 undergraduates attended rush parties. Twenty-five were chosen to be members of the first pledge class. They pledged through January 1977 and were initiated on February 4.Saddle Tramps - About When the organization first began, the High Riders had no direct funds from the university. They had to support themselves by way of bake sales, selling dorm room carpet, and selling programs at Lady Raiders sporting events. In time, the High Riders expanded and played an even greater role by helping the Lady Raiders with airport transportation, game management, and giving recruits campus tours.Tech Hall of Honor inducts new class of six Symbols Double T Double T spirit logo The most readily identified symbol of Texas Tech is the Double T logo. The logo, generally attributed to Texas Tech's first football coach, E. Y. Freeland, was first used as decoration on the sweaters for the football players. The Double T existed in its original form as an official logo from 1963 to 1999 and was updated in 2000. The new logo maintains the original promise but incorporates three-dimensional bevelling effects coupled with white trim. To recognize the importance of the Double T to Texas Tech, the class of 1931 donated the Double T bench. Per tradition, freshmen are not allowed to sit on the bench, which is currently located in the courtyard of the Administration Building. The logo is further embodied in the Double T neon sign, donated by the class of 1938 and affixed to the east side of Jones AT&T; Stadium. At the time of its purchase, this was reputedly the largest neon sign in existence. Seal The seal at the campus' entrance Designed by the campus master planner William Ward Watkin, and helped fund raised by the Saddle Tramps in 1924, the Texas Tech seal was officially approved in 1953. It actually first appeared on Tech diplomas in 1948. The seal's symbols are the lamp, which represents \\"school,\\" the key for \\"home,\\" the book for \\"church,\\" and the star stands for \\"state.\\" Cotton bolls represent the area's strong cotton industry and the eagle is suggestive of the United States. On April 27, 1972, the seal was placed at the Broadway and University entrance to campus in what became known as the Amon G. Carter Plaza. It is made of red granite and stands 12 feet high.http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/text/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/05mediaguide- history.pdf p. 160 Miscellaneous Bangin‚Äô Bertha Saddle Tramps carry Bangin Bertha, a bell on a trailer, to all home football games and homecoming events. Bertha was designed in 1959 by Saddle Tramp Joe Winegar, and was donated by the Santa Fe Railroad. Bangin' Bertha is considered a spirit-raiser and a big tradition at Texas Tech.http://www.ttu.edu/traditions/bells.php On September 28, 2012, the Big 12 Conference banned artificial noisemakers while the ball is in play and then once the offense reaches the line of scrimmage. Failure to comply will result in a 15-yard penalty. Guns Up Guns Up! The hand sign of Texas Tech is the \\"Guns Up\\". It is made by extending the index finger outward while extending the thumb upward and tucking in the middle, little and fourth fingers to form a gun to signify that the Red Raiders will shoot down their opponents. It acts as both a greeting and a sign of victory used by fans and players at athletic events. The sign was created in 1971 by Texas Tech alumnus L. Glenn Dippel, who was living in Austin and wanted an answer to the Hook 'em Horns sign used by University of Texas fans.Texas Tech University :: Campus Information :: History & Traditions :: Guns Up Texas Tech class ring Texas Tech alumni ring While the class ring had occasionally used a universal design, by the late 20th century various styles were available. In 1999, the university reverted to a single ring design for the university's graduates. The new Official Texas Tech Alumni Association Class Ring symbolically captures the essence of Texas Tech with the prominent Double T logo surrounded by the school's full name and date of foundation. By tradition, undergraduates wear the ring with the Double T logo facing themselves. Upon graduation, the ring is turned so the logo faces outward. One shoulder of the ring displays an image of the Administration Building, with the bells which represent victory. The other shoulder contains the university seal: an American eagle perched above a book, representing the church; a star, representing the State of Texas; a key, representing home; and, a lamp, representing knowledge. These elements are separated by a cross featuring ten cotton bolls, one each for Lubbock and its nine surrounding cotton-producing counties.

It was designed in response to a USAAF Technical Instruction issued for the development of a helicopter to transport passengers, cargo, or wounded personnel within an enclosed fuselage. Kellett's proposal followed the general layout that the company was developing in the XR-8, with twin intermeshing rotors, and was accepted by the Air Force on 16 October over proposals by Sikorsky, Bell, and Platt-LePage. The XR-10 resembled a scaled-up XR-8, although its twin engines were carried in nacelles at the fuselage sides, driving the rotors via long driveshafts, and the aircraft was skinned entirely in metal. The first of two prototypes flew on 24 April 1947, and at the time, was the largest rotorcraft to fly in the United States.NASM During test- flights, however, the same problem that had been encountered with the XR-8's rotor system emerged when blades from the two rotors collided in flight. With fixes in place, flight testing continued, but on 3 October 1949, the first prototype crashed due to a control system failure and killed Kellett's chief test pilot, Dave Driskill. The project was abandoned shortly thereafter, and a 16-seat civil variant, the KH-2, never left the drawing board.

He was also a colonial investor who was one of the incorporators of the Providence Company in 1630. He was a moderate supporter of the Parliamentary cause in the English Civil War. Background and early life Rudyerd was the son of James Rudyerd of Hartley Wintney, Hampshire. He was educated at Winchester College and St John's College, Oxford, and then joined the Middle Temple, where he was called to the bar in 1600.http://archive.middletemple.org.uk/Shared%20Documents/MTAR/MTAR%20-1501-1781.pdf Poetry As a young man Rudyerd's poetry, though not printed until after his death, won him many plaudits, and he was also respected as a critic. He became a close friend of the poet and playwright Ben Jonson, who addressed three published epigrams to him in 1616, the first of which began: > Rudyerd, as lesser dames to great ones use, > My lighter comes to kiss thy learned muse Rudyerd was also an associate of John Owen and John Hoskins (who once wounded him in a duel, although they later became firm friends). More valuable to him, however, was the admiration of the Earl of Pembroke, England's leading patron of the arts, who helped promote Rudyerd's political career. Rudyerd's most important surviving poems are a series written in answer to poems by the Earl. Political career In 1618, Rudyerd was knighted, and appointed for life to the lucrative post of Surveyor of the Court of Wards. (When the post was abolished in 1647, Parliament voted him ¬£6,000 in compensation for its loss.) He had a long career in parliament and most of the constituencies for which he sat were ones where the Pembroke influence was strong. In 1621, he was elected Member of Parliament for Portsmouth. He was re-elected MP for Portsmouth in 1624 and 1625. At first, Rudyerd was generally supportive of the court, in line with the policy of his patron Pembroke, and by 1624 seems to have been the government's unofficial spokesman in the Commons. He continued to support Buckingham after the accession of Charles I. In 1626 he was elected MP for Old Sarum and although he was one of the MPs named to assist in Buckingham's impeachment in 1626 took no public part in the trial. He was elected MP for Downton in 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. By the end of the decade, he was less supportive of the Crown, taking a strongly critical line on the redress of grievances and denying the King's right to arrest without showing cause. Nevertheless, he assumed the role of mediator between the King and Parliament, arguing in a speech \\"This is the crisis of Parliaments: we shall know by this if parliaments live or die. If we persevere, the King to draw one way, the parliament another, the Commonwealth must sink in the midst.\\" During the interval between the Parliaments of 1629 and 1640, Rudyerd became interested in colonial developments in North America, and in 1630 was a co-founder of the Providence Company. In 1634 he purchased the manor of West Woodhay, Berkshire. In April 1640 Rudyerd was elected MP for Wilton in the Short Parliament. He resumed his role of mediator, speaking on the first day of debate in the Short Parliament and concluding that \\"I would desire nothing more than that we proceed with such moderation as the parliament may be the mother of many more happy parliaments\\". In November 1640 he was re-elected MP for Wilton in the Long Parliament. His first speech in the Long Parliament was less conciliatory and was a vigorous attack on the King's \\"evil counsellors\\". Rudyerd took the Parliamentary side on the outbreak of the Civil War, but does not seem to have been an enthusiastic supporter of the cause, and his attendance in the House was twice specially ordered. In 1643, he was one of the MPs appointed to the Westminster Assembly and in the same years was also a member of the council appointed by the Long Parliament in 1643 for the government of the English colonies. He was opposed to the trial of the King and was excluded from Parliament in Pride's Purge, after which he retired from public life. His time in parliament was long and, in the words of Brunton & Pennington, \\"unhampered by political consistency\\" though contemporaries nicknamed him the silver trumpet of Parliaments for his pleasing oratory. Rudyerd died at the age of about 86 at West Woodhay House, Berkshire, in 1658. Rudyerd married Elizabeth Harington, daughter of Sir Henry Harington and a relation of the Earl of Pembroke.

He also was a lawyer, politician, and businessman from the state of Alabama. Early life and career Withers was born in 1814 in Huntsville, located in both Madison County and Limestone County, Alabama. He was a son of John Wright Withers, a Virginia planter, and of Mary Herbert Jones. He was of English descent.http://genealogytrails.com/ala/tuscaloosa/bios.html Withers received his education at Greene Academy in Huntsville.Wakelyn, p. 444. In 1831 he attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, and graduated four years later standing 44th out of 56 cadets. He was appointed a brevet second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Dragoons on July 1, 1835. He was posted to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and resigned his commission the following year on December 5.Eicher, p. 577. After resigning, Withers began a law practice in Alabama. In 1836 he entered the state's militia forces, and he later became a cotton broker. On January 12, 1837, Withers married Rebecca Eloise Forney, and the couple had ten children together. He was admitted to Alabama's bar association in 1838. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Withers was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army on March 3, 1847, and was assigned to the 13th U.S. Infantry. He was promoted to colonel on September 13 in the 9th U.S. Infantry, and resigned on May 23, 1848.Eicher, p. 578. Withers returned to Alabama following the war with Mexico and became a merchant there before entering local politics. He served first in Alabama's State Legislature, then, in 1855, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. From 1858 to 1861, Withers was the mayor of Mobile, Alabama. Civil War service During the American Civil War, Withers chose to follow his home state and the Confederate cause, and entered the Confederate States Army in 1861. He was appointed the colonel of the 3rd Alabama Infantry on April 28, and served briefly as commander of the Department of Norfolk that May. Withers was promoted to brigadier general on July 10, and began his Western Theater service in the fall. Withers during the Civil War Withers commanded the District of Alabama from September 12, 1861, to January 27, 1862.Eicher, p. 578. Dist. of Alabama, in Department No. 2 (September 12-October 14) and in Dept. of Alabama & West Florida (October 14-January 27, 1862) His command was re-designated the Army of Mobile on January 27 until February 5, and became the 2nd Division of the II Corps in the Army of Mississippi on March 29. Withers fought during the Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee on April 6, and was promoted to major general from that date.Warner, pp. 342-3. He commanded the reserve corps of the Army of Mississippi from June 30 to August 18, later referred to as \\"Withers' Division\\" in the \\"Right Wing\\" until November 20. The Army of Mississippi was renamed the Army of Tennessee on November 20, 1862, and Withers led his 2nd Division with distinction during the Battle of Stones River from December 31 to January 2, 1863. His conduct in the fight was praised by his corps commander, Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk, as well as by the army's commander, General Braxton Bragg.Warner, p. 343. An account of his performance at Stones River (also called Murfreesboro) follows: Withers commanded his division until resigning his commission in the Confederate Army on July 13, 1863, but was quickly restored to his rank as a major general a week later. He was given command of the District of North Alabama in the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana from February 6 to July 27, 1864. He then commanded the reserve forces of Alabama from April 30 to May 4, 1865. He was paroled at Meridian, Mississippi on May 11, after the department had been surrendered and the war came to an end. Postbellum Withers was pardoned by the U.S. government on December 28, 1865, and returned to civilian life in Alabama. Withers again took up the law, then became a cotton broker and editor of Mobile's Tribune newspaper. Briefly, in 1867, Withers was once again mayor of the city of Mobile, and from 1878 to 1879, he was treasurer of the city. Withers died in 1890, in Mobile, and was buried in the Magnolia Cemetery.

They are best known today for their recording of \\"Stormy Weather\\". \\"Stormy Weather\\" is today considered one of the most collectible doo-wop singles ever released. After the group broke up, several of the members went on to join other groups, such as The Videos. The recording of \\"Stormy Weather\\" In 1952, after months of performing at local functions, The Five Sharps were spotted by a producer and taken into a studio to record two songs. The group recorded their own \\"Sleepy Cowboy\\" and the standard \\"Stormy Weather\\". The session took most of the day and they were paid in hot dogs and soda pop. First tenor Bobby Ward remembers that sales of \\"Stormy Weather\\" were so bad that he and the other members had to buy their own copies even though they'd never been paid for the recording in the first place. The song was released on Jubilee #5104. The 78 In late 1961, record collector Billy Pensabene found a 78 rpm copy of the record and brought it to Times Square Records, run by Irving ‚ÄúSlim‚Äù Rose. Slim borrowed the record to play on his ‚ÄúSink Or Swim With Swingin' Slim‚Äù radio show on WBNX. While in his care, however, the record was broken. Slim admitted in June 1965 that the record \\"broke under [his] arm\\" on the way home from the studio, but at other times he claimed that his pet raccoon, Teddy, had broken the disc by sitting on it. Slim assured his angry customer that he would replace the broken record. He put up a sign in his store offering $25 in credit for a 78 of the song and $50 for a 45 rpm single. When weeks went by without any takers on his offer, Slim raised the rewards. Slim then went to the owner of Jubilee Records, Jerry Blaine, to get him to reissue the original. He was told that \\"Stormy Weather\\" was one of a batch of 80 masters which had been destroyed in a fire. Since Jubilee, in 1952, had been releasing singles on both the 78 and 45 formats, collectors assumed that there must be a 45 somewhere (even then, collectors valued 45s much more than 78s). None ever surfaced, however, and only a handful of 78's of \\"Stormy Weather\\" have ever been found. The re-recording In 1964, as the legend of the song grew, Jubilee hired a new group of musicians, under the name of The Five Sharps. They then recorded a new version of \\"Stormy Weather\\". It was released as Jubilee 5478, a 45 single. This version isn't nearly as collectible as the first version. After \\"Stormy Weather\\" Cuffey was diagnosed with leukemia and died in 1960. Bassett joined late-period incarnations of both the Drifters and the Flamingos, and later, formed the '70s band Creative Funk. Bobby Ward cut one unsuccessful record titled 'The Key To The City' in New York in the mid 1960s but was largely inactive musically. The other members, pianist Tommy Duckett and Mickey Owens, left the music industry until 1975, when four of the surviving group members including Ward performed at the Academy of Music in New York.

Set in the 1950s, the narrator Ifan Powel takes part in a time travel experiment and lands in Cardiff in the year 2033. He is hosted by a family and for 5 days is taken on a journey around Wales. He finds that Wales has secured self government and is prosperous economically, and socially harmonious; everyone is bilingual in both Welsh and English. He falls in love with the daughter of his host family, Mair, and when he returns to the Wales of the 1950s his longing for her makes him want to return to 2033. The scientist conducting the experiment cautions him against this as the future is not set and Ifan may therefore encounter a very different future if he travels again (see Rules of Time Travel), but after Ifan begs for his help he agrees to send Ifan back. However, when Ifan returns he finds a totally different Wales. In this dystopian future, the Welsh language has died out and traces of Welsh identity have all but disappeared. Indeed, even the country's name has been changed to \\"Western England\\". Violence and social tensions are also commonplace. Ifan only stays here for two days in order to look for Mair, but when he finds her he discovers that her name in this future is Maria, and she has no memory of him. After returning to the present for the second time, the scientist explains to Ifan that both scenarios that Ifan encountered are possible for Wales and that it is up to the Welsh people which one comes to pass. This converts Ifan into a Welsh nationalist (he had previously been opposed to nationalism) and he swears to do everything within his power to ensure that the Wales that he visited first is the one that will be realised. The novel is significant in the history of Welsh-language literature in that it was the first major science fiction work for adults to be written in the Welsh language, but it has been argued that the fact that it is (on the author's own admission) a blatant work of political propaganda diminishes its literary value to an extent. In 2017 Gareth Glyn composed an opera based on the novel with the libretto by Mererid Hopwood. In 2019 the novel was translated into English by Stephen Morris. An attempt to crowdfund the publication of the book in hard copy format was unsuccessful, but the whole translated text has been made available to read on the book's website.

Bowen, On British Islam: Religion, Law, and Everyday Practice in Shari øa Councils, Princeton University Press (2016), p. 59 His PhD thesis from SOAS, submitted in 2010, was on Islamic law and entitled \\"A critical analysis of selected aspects of Sunni Muslim minority fiqh, with particular reference to contemporary Britain.\\"Record on E-Theses Online Service Controversial remarks In 2001, Haitham al-Haddad allegedly said \\"I will tell you the truth about the fight between us and Jews who are the enemies of God and the descendants of apes and pigs\\". He later said that \\"this is the translation of what has been attributed to me\\" and that it had been incorrectly translated from Arabic to English. A journalist for Radio Netherlands Worldwide wrote, \\"Strikingly, the cleric omits the definite article \\"the\\" before \\"Jews.\\" In the Arabic language, this omission could be taken to mean he was not speaking about Jews in general but only about those Jews who are enemies of God and descendants of apes and pigs. Haddad was also accused of praising Osama bin Laden in 2011 following the latter's death; an allegation for which he successfully claimed libel and a retraction from The Times. In an article called ‚ÄòStanding up against Homosexuality‚Äô, Haddad wrote of ‚Äúthe scourge of homosexuality‚Äù, which he calls a ‚Äúcriminal act‚Äù. On women, he declared that ‚Äúa man should not be questioned why he hit his wife, because this is something between them‚Äù. In addition to this he has also claimed that ‚Äúthe most honourable and worthy role for a woman is striving to be a fine wife...this role does not only secure the best for a woman in the hereafter, but also fits perfectly with her natural disposition‚Äù He has claimed that there is a \\"proper\\" way of performing FGM, further saying \\"it is consensus of all the scholars that female circumcision is sunnah [proper]\\". Controversial events 2012 Netherlands visit In February 2012, the Dutch parliament majority tried to prevent Haddad speaking at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The university subsequently cancelled the event. Haddad blamed the opposition to him on a Jewish lobby. London \\"mega-mosque\\" project Haddad called for a 15,000-people march to put pressure on Newham council to permit building of a large mosque in West Ham, London Borough of Newham, which would have been three times the size of St Paul's Cathedral. Opposition to al-Haddad and the mosque project as a whole was led by a local councillor, Alan Craig, who eventually in 2014 would join UKIP. University of Westminster In February 2015, the University of Westminster postponed a talk by al-Haddad after it was revealed that Mohammed Emwazi, known as \\"Jihadi John\\", became radicalised at that university. Over 3,000 had signed a petition for him to be banned from campus, stating that his presence could endanger LGBT students. University of Kent In March 2015, the University of Kent postponed a talk by al-Haddad, hosted by the university's Islamic Society as part of \\"Discover Islam Week\\". The university's Vice-Chancellor cancelled the talk after controversy spread among some students regarding al-Haddad's messages.  Cases against the media   Libel case against 'The Times'  In August 2015 al-Haddad successfully claimed for libel against The Times newspaper. Following the settlement the Sunday Times published a correction (16 Aug, 2015) clarifying amongst a number of false allegations, that al- Haddad had not praised Osama bin Laden, and neither had he been banned from speaking at the London School of Economics nor London Metropolitan University.  Libel case against 'Telegraph Media Group'  In June 2019 al-Haddad settled a claim against the Telegraph Media Group. The Sunday Telegraph had published a series of articles during 2015, which it continued to publish online, which variously claimed that Dr Al-Haddad had described Jews as ‚Äúthe descendants of apes and pigs‚Äù, and the ‚Äúbrethren of swine and pigs‚Äù. As part of the terms of settlement, the Telegraph contributed ¬£62500 towards al- Haddad's legal costs, published a statement withdrawing the allegations, and apologised.

It was discovered on 11 April 2004, by American astronomer Jim Young at the Table Mountain Observatory near Wrightwood, California, in the United States. The asteroid was named for American astronaut Jerome Apt.  Orbit and classification  Jeromeapt is a member of the Massalia family (), a large family of stony S-type asteroids with low inclinations. It orbits the Sun in the inner main belt at a distance of 2.0‚Äì2.9 AU once every 3 years and 10 months (1,400 days; semi-major axis of 2.45 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid's observation arc begins more than 2 years prior to its official discovery observation, with a precovery taken by Spacewatch at the Steward Observatory in February 2002.  Naming  This minor planet was named in honor of American Jerome Apt (born 1949), who was the discovering observatory's director and also an astronaut on four Space Shuttle missions in the 1990s. At the time of naming this asteroid, he was a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center 29 October 2012 ().  Physical characteristics  Since Massalia asteroids are of silicaceous rather than carbonaceous composition, with an albedo typically around 0.22 (also see list of families), Jeromeapt possibly measures 1.1 kilometer in diameter, based on an absolute magnitude of 17.1. As of 2018, the asteroid's effective size, its composition and albedo, as well as its rotation period and shape remain unknown.

Snyder, the second book in the Study series. The series is about a girl named Yelena who was kidnapped as a child from her home in Sitia from the Zaltana clan, who are strong in magic. At the age of sixteen, her magical abilities (illegal in Ixia) begin to show and she is experimented upon by her kidnappers, who tell her she was orphan. After killing one of her tormentors and awaiting her death in a dungeon, she is given the opportunity to become the Commander's food taster and live. Plot After saving the life of the Commander, falling in love with Valek, the assassin, and discovering she was kidnapped as a child because of her suspected magical abilities, Yelena is forced to return to her original home of Sitia to train in magic so she is no longer an unstable threat to the magical world. The death sentence upon her from Ixia for her ability to do magic, despite her saving the Commander, also prevents her return to Ixia and her love, Valek. Yelena is taken to the Zaltana clan and meets her long lost parents and older brother, Leif, who despises her and states his belief that she is a spy for Ixia. Because of his abilities as a magic user himself, many in her clan think he may be right, but her parents are welcoming despite her inability to remember them. When Leif leaves for the Academy to advise the Council, Yelena must accompany him to start her training at the Academy. Along the way, they are ambushed by Cahil and his soldiers, who tells her that he is the sole heir to the throne of Ixia, the only one that Valek missed during his assassinations in the Commander's takeover. He intends to have what is rightfully his, and wants Yelena to give him information about troop movements and such in Ixia. Though Yelena protests that she is not a spy, Cahil keeps her in chains. She escapes, but comes back later that night of her own accord to strike a deal with Cahil, since they are going to the same place and she wants to prove her innocence. Cahil brings her before the First Magician, Roze, who essentially rapes Yelena's mind before declaring she is not a spy. Yelena manages to mostly fend her off, but spends several days in horror recuperating before beginning the basics of her training. During her training, Yelena assists in helping a young woman raped and beaten by a serial killer who inadvertently left her alive. In doing so, she discovers that she is likely a Soulfinder, a very powerful magic user. However, Yelena tries not to believe this is so, as the last Soulfinder stole people's souls and used them to his own purposes before he was finally killed. She has a talent for influencing people and can at times take over their bodies, leaving her own. Yelena's methods of doing things her own way and relying only on herself bring the wrath of her mentor, the Fourth Magician Irys, and when she goes off on her own to meet the serial killer, who has taken eleven souls of girls and needs a twelfth to come to him willingly, Irys breaks off the mind link between them in anger. But Yelena has Valek for help, as he has arrived in disguise with an Ixian delegation and has a natural immunity to magic. Together, and with help from her reluctant brother, they capture the killer. With the help of a Story Weaver magician named Moon Man, Yelena and Leif work out their differences as well, though they still banter as a real brother and sister. However, the killer, who they nickname Ferde, is not the only rogue magician still out there. Yelena and another group of magicians fight many of the rogues, but are forced to retreat to fight another day. Valek returns to the delegation headed back to Ixia, and Yelena joins them briefly as well, at the request of the Commander, who promises to revoke her death sentence if she becomes a spy. Instead, Yelena offers to act as an intermediary between the two countries, once her magic training is complete. Characters Yelena ‚Äì Main heroine. Yelena is on her way to be reunited with the family she'd been stolen from long ago. Although she has gained her freedom, she can't help feeling isolated in Sitia. Her Ixian background has changed her in many ways, and her new-found friends and relatives don't think it's for the better. Despite the turmoil, she's eager to start her magical training. But her plans take a radical turn when she becomes involved with a plot to reclaim Ixia's throne for a lost prince, and gets entangled in powerful rivalries with her fellow magicians. It also appears her brother would love to see her dead. Luckily, Yelena has some old friends to help her with her new enemies. Valek ‚Äì Main hero and Yelena's love interest, a highly skilled Assassin who is famous and feared for killing the former king, and being immune to magic. As the chief of security, Valek's duties involve keeping the Territory of Ixia and the Commander safe. He's in charge of a vast network of spies throughout Ixia and into the southern lands of Sitia. The work suits him as he enjoys putting together pieces of information and discovering plots and plans well before they are initiated. Patience learned when he studied the assassin arts aids him when he does find an illegal activity in full swing. Watching and learning as much as he can, Valek will only pounce when he's assured of catching all the culprits. He confident to the point of cockiness. Ari ‚Äì Secondary character. Ari is down-to-earth, solid, strong and unflappable. His intelligence helped him rise through the ranks of the Commander's Army from Private to Captain. He is the complete opposite of his partner, Janco, who can drive him crazy at times, but Ari will not trust anyone else to protect his back. Janco ‚Äì Secondary character. Quick- witted and fleet footed, Janco is a fast fighter and talker. He loves to duel with swords and sing rhymes to unnerve his opponents. Known as a jokester, Janco is frequently underestimated and has surprised many with his fighting skills. His views on life are rather odd and he enjoys embellishing a good story. His partner, Ari keeps him in line and grounds him. Janco's constant bantering and bickering with others makes for either high entertainment or pure annoyance depending on who it is, but if anyone threatens one of his friends, Janco turns deadly serious. Irys ‚Äì Secondary character. The 'Fourth Master Magician' of Sitia, Irys, who makes several brief appearances in Poison Study, becomes Yelena's mentor in an effort to teach control of her magical abilities. Throughout the novel, Irys and Yelena contact each other with a mental connection the student and teacher have created. Irys's 'Spirit Guide' which supposedly gave guidance during the Master Magician test, is a hawk. Cahil ‚Äì Secondary character, antagonist. Cahil and his army from Ixia kidnap Yelena and her brother, Leif, who abandons Yelena's welfare to befriend Cahil. Cahil claims he is the nephew of the late King of Ixia, slain by Valek. It is later revealed that Cahil is the son of an Ixian soldier and has no relation to the King. Lief ‚Äì Secondary character. Yelena's brother, Lief witnessed her kidnapping fourteen years before. He searched for her all those years, he loved his sister dearly. When she returns he thinks that she has been corrupted by Ixia, and tries to have her captured and killed.

Plot  After learning that they have five more cards to track down, Michael Scofield confronts Don Self about the news. Self swears that he knows nothing about the five other cards, and orders him to track the next one by the end of the day, or they will return to prison. Michael has no choice but to find the second Scylla card. While Michael discusses with the gang about finding the next card, Alexander Mahone disappears to make a call to Agent Felicia Lang, imploring her to find out who murdered his son. Lincoln Burrows becomes suspicious of Mahone, as he overhears the phone call. Meanwhile in Self's office, his director, Stanton is shocked to discover the fact that Scofield's team has to find another five cards. Despite Self's reassurances, Stanton is adamant that the team will not succeed and decides to shut down the operation. Sara Tancredi discovers an e-mail that was sent to Stuart Tuxhorn about an arrival in London. Mahone suggests that the email is actually written in code, and Scofield quickly deciphers the contents, revealing the word \\"Scylla\\", and a four o'clock meeting. Roland then traces the e-mails to a server in Anaheim. While Fernando Sucre and Brad Bellick stake out Tuxhorn's office, the rest head to Anaheim to hack into the main server. Sara distracts an officer by claiming that she has \\"a job interview with human resources\\", sneaking his security badge from desk and passing it to Michael. Michael and Roland find the server room on the first floor and Roland proceeds to retrieve the email. Lincoln, who is observing from afar, spots the officer confronting Sara over his security badge, and calls Michael to warn him. To stall for time, Michael activates the fire alarm. When Roland successfully retrieves the email, they realize that they are trapped in the server room. As a fire safety measure, the server room is locked down and the oxygen is sucked out of the room to prevent the spread of the fire. Michael manages to call Lincoln, who shows up in time with a fire axe and rescues them by smashing a window.

Elsewhere in Chicago, Wyatt interrogates Bruce Bennett, who doesn't reveal anything. Wyatt injects him with a substance which seems to disorient him, trying to make him talk. Bennett maintains that he does not know their whereabouts, but eventually reveals that Sara is somewhere in Los Angeles. With this new-found information, Wyatt shoots Bennett in the back of the head, execution style. Back in Los Angeles, Sucre and Bellick prepare to leave when Tuxhorn does not shows up for work. However, they are quickly surrounded by armed agents and Sucre manages to text Michael a warning message, asking them simply to \\"Run.\\" The gang flees after Roland learns that he is being locked out of the servers.

While there are various forms, epistemic conservatism is generally the view that a person's believing some claim is a reason in support of the claim, at least on the face of it.Fumerton (2007), p. 63. Others formulate epistemic conservatism as the view that one is, to some degree, justified in believing something simply because one believes it.Christensen (1994), p. 69. Expanding the thesis, epistemic conservatism implies that it is unreasonable to revise or alter our personal beliefs and ideologies without good reasons to do so. This action of revising would cause an unnecessary use of resources/energy by the individual, and it would not offer the individual any epistemic value. Epistemic conservatism sees an epistemic value in just holding one's beliefs stable. There have been some critics of the thesis but several important methodologies assume that this thesis holds true.  Kevin McCain's Epistemic Conservatism  > ‚ÄòProperly Formulated Epistemic Conservatism‚Äô (PEC): ‚ÄúIf S believes that p > and p is not incoherent, then S is justified in retaining the belief that p > and S remains justified in believing that p so long as p is not defeated for > S.‚Äù > ‚ÄúDefeat Condition 1 (DC1): If S has better reasons for believing that ‚àº p > than S‚Äôs reasons for believing that p, then S is no longer justified in > believing that p.‚Äù > ‚ÄúDefeat Condition 2 (DC2): If S has reasons for believing that‚àºp which are > as good as S‚Äôs reasons for believing that p and the belief that ‚àºp coheres > equally as well or better than the belief that p does with S‚Äôs other > beliefs, then S is no longer justified in believing that p.‚Äù This above thesis hits upon several common themes when discussing epistemic conservatism. PEC addresses the idea that when revising a belief system, individuals would seek to correct the errors piece by piece, rather than completely overhauling their ideologies. In other words, it is ideal to hold on to as many original beliefs as possible.Furthermore, PEC addresses spontaneous beliefs based on memories. It is hard to justify memory beliefs given that they are not drawn through distinct experiences, but regardless if they are/aren‚Äôt supported, individuals would still have the intuition that they are justified in holding these beliefs. According to PEC, as long as a specific memory belief is not defeated for the individual, the individual would be justified in holding this belief in virtue of previously holding the memory belief. As for forgotten evidence, PEC also makes sense of this phenomenon. An example would be where someone learned about relativity theory and came to hold the belief ‚ÄúE=mc^2‚Äù. After a long time, this person might have lost evidence supporting this specific belief, but we are intuitively drawn to claiming that they are still justified. PEC allows for this because the individual is justified in holding ‚ÄúE=mc^2‚Äù because they hold that belief.  Criticisms of Epistemic Conservatism   Richard Foley's Criticism  In his objections, Foley describes a situation where epistemic conservatism makes irrational beliefs rational, where a contradiction exists. In his example, an individual believes ‚Äúx‚Äù, however they possess better reasons to believe ‚Äú~x‚Äù. In terms of PEC, the individual is justified in believing ‚Äúx‚Äù as long as ‚Äúx‚Äù is not defeated for them. In Foley's example, ‚Äúx‚Äù is defeated for the individual so Defeat Condition 1 was met, thus PEC leads to the individual not being justified in believing ‚Äúx‚Äù, thus no contradiction exists.  Richard Feldman's \\"Lefty-Righty\\" Case  > ‚ÄúDetective Jones has definitively narrowed down the suspects in a crime to > two individuals, Lefty and Righty. There are good reasons to think that > Lefty did it, but there are equally good reasons to think that Righty did > it. There is conclusive reason to think that no one other than Lefty or > Righty did it.‚Äù In this example, Feldman questions what Detective Jones would do in the situation, as the intuition points out that Jones can not believe that Righty did the crime and Lefty did not and vice versa. He supposes that Jones came upon the belief that Lefty did it first, possibly getting Lefty's evidence first. Feldman draws the conclusion that epistemic conservatism forces our intuition away, forcing us to have Jones believe that Lefty did it. However, PEC allows for this because Jones's belief that Lefty is the culprit is defeated since he now has equal evidence to believe that Righty committed the crime. By having the two equal beliefs of ‚ÄúLefty is the culprit‚Äù and ‚ÄúRighty is the culprit‚Äù, Defeat Condition 2 was met. With PEC, Jones should withhold his belief from either of the two, thus PEC does not disagree with our natural intuitions. Notes References and further reading * Christensen, David.

After the Volksmarine was disbanded just before the reunification of Germany, she was sold to Malta in 1997 and renamed P29 and was used as a patrol boat. After being decommissioned, she was scuttled as a dive site in 2007 off ƒäirkewwa. History East Germany The minesweeper was laid down on 8 October 1969 at Peenewerft shipyard in Wolgast. She was launched on 22 May 1970 and commissioned on 19 September of that same year. She was the eighteenth ship to be built within the Kondor I class, and was named Boltenhagen after the town of the same name in Rostock. She was used to patrol the river banks between East and West Germany, as well as a minesweeper. Germany After the reunification of Germany, the minesweeper was decommissioned along with most of the Kondor I-class. However, it was then used as a patrol vessel by the German Federal Coast Guard. The name Boltenhagen was retained but she was given the pennant number BG31. The ship's guns were dismantled, the radio and radar equipment was changed, and it was repainted. BG31, the last Kondor-I in the German Coast Guard, was decommissioned on 30 June 1996. Malta The former minesweeper was then purchased by Malta on 24 July 1997 and was given the pennant number P29. She rejoined her sister ships Ueckerm√ºnde and Pasewalk which were purchased by Malta back in 1992 and were given the pennant numbers P30 and P31. P29 became a patrol boat within the Offshore Command of the Maritime Squadron of the Armed Forces of Malta. Since the former minesweepers were purchased unarmed, some light armament was then added by the AFM. P29 was then used to secure the Maltese coast against smuggling and border control operations. She was decommissioned in 2004 and was bought by the Malta Tourism Authority in September 2005. She was cleaned and then was scuttled on 14 August 2007 off the port of ƒäirkewwa to serve as a diving site and artificial reef. Wreck The wreck now lies at a depth of around 35 metres but the entire dive may be done at 25 metres. The highest point is situated only 12 metres deep from the surface. Since it was quite recently sunk compared to the and other wreck sites in Malta, it requires some time to attract a good amount of marine life inside and around it.

Historically, medical research and the practice of medicine tended to rely on an acute care model for the treatment of all medical problems, including chronic illness. Treatment choices made for a particular patient under a dynamic regime are based on that individual's characteristics and history, with the goal of optimizing his or her long-term clinical outcome. A dynamic treatment regime is analogous to a policy in the field of reinforcement learning, and analogous to a controller in control theory.

This type of abnormal behaviour shows that a key stimulus is not always needed to produce an activity. Vacuum activities often take place when an animal is placed in captivity and is subjected to a lack of stimuli that would normally cause a FAP. Etymology From Latin vacuum (an empty space, void) noun use of neuter of vacuus (empty) related to vacare (be empty). History Konrad Lorenz, winner of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine The term was first established by the ethologist Konrad Lorenz in the 1930s after observations of a hand-raised starling. In 1937 Lorenz wrote: \\"With head and eyes the bird made a motion as though following a flying insect with its gaze; its posture tautened; it took off, snapped, returned to its perch, and with its bill performed the sideways lashing, tossing motions with which many insectivorous birds slay their prey against whatever they happen to be sitting upon. Then the starling swallowed several times, whereupon its closely laid plumage loosened up somewhat, and there often ensued a quivering reflex, exactly as it does after real satiation.\\"  Lorenz's Hydraulic Model of Motivation  Animals that were raised without releasing instinctual behaviours, due to being in captivity or being taken as a pet, will produce these vacuum behaviours in seemingly random moments due to a build-up of energy reserves. This theory is based on Lorenz's Hydraulic Model of Motivation, which attempts to explain the mechanism of FAPs by equating energy input to water adding up in a container, leading to a valve which, under normal circumstances, is opened upon addition of a releaser or sign stimulus, to produce a FAP. When a sign stimulus or releaser is not present, this leads to an energy (water) build-up, forcing the valve open and producing the FAP in the absence of a stimulus.  Evolution and Genetics  Over time as animals have evolved, natural selection has favoured some behaviours over others because they have ensured the survival and reproduction of the animal. These potentially long-lasting, innate behaviours have a genetic origin that propagates through evolutionary time, becoming slightly altered due to environmental changes and mutations. The study of Epigenetics explains how certain mutations (e.g., histone modification and DNA methylation) affect how genes are expressed without altering the genetic code, suggesting learning from the environment can change gene expression, and thus neural pathways, to modify the animals behaviour within its lifetime. These FAPs, or instinctual, stereotyped behaviours lead to the production of vacuum activities when the environment is lacking the necessary stimuli, revealing a deeply intwined relationship between an external stimulus in the environment, genes, and learning. This is illustrated in the act of primates shaking branches in their natural environment to cause a distraction from predators and the inclination for captive primates in zoos to shake roof beams even though they cannot know if a predator is outside. The animals physiology is attempting to produce an instinctual behaviour that is common for that particular species but the necessary external stimulus is not present. Examples Wild raccoons often appear to 'wash' their food which may be expressed as a vacuum activity by captive raccoons in the absence of water.  Birds  Lorenz observed that a starling bird snapped at the air when flying as if it were catching insects though there were no real insects there. Weaver birds go through complicated nest building behaviour when there is no nest building material present. Sham dustbathing (sometimes referred to as \\"vacuum dustbathing\\") is a behaviour performed by some birds when kept in cages with little or no access to litter. During sham dustbathing, the birds perform all the elements of normal dust bathing, but in the complete absence of any substrate. This behaviour often has all the activities and temporal patterns of normal dustbathing, i.e. the bird initially scratches and bill- rakes at the ground, then erects her feathers and squats. Once lying down, the behaviour contains four main elements: vertical wing-shaking, head rubbing, bill-raking and scratching with one leg. However, hens \\"dustbathing\\" on wire floors commonly perform this close to the feed trough where they can peck and bill-rake in the food. Because it seems the birds appear to treat the feed as a dustbathing substrate, the term \\"sham dustbathing\\" is more appropriate.  Racoons  Wild raccoons often investigate their food by rubbing it between their paws while holding the food underwater, giving the appearance of 'washing' the food (although the exact motivation for this behaviour is disputed). Captive raccoons sometimes perform these actions of 'washing' their food by rubbing it between their paws, even when there is no water available. This is most likely a vacuum activity based on foraging behaviour at shorelines.  Calves  One vacuum activity that has been studied is 'tongue-rolling' by calves. Calves raised for 'white' veal are generally fed a milk-like diet from birth until they are slaughtered at about four months of age. The calves are prevented from consuming roughage such as grass or hay partly because the iron contained in such plant-based food would cause their muscles to assume a normal reddish colour instead of the pale colour that purchasers of this product demand. The diet, however, is unnatural because calves would normally start to forage and ruminate from about two weeks of age. When limited to a milky diet, some calves will spend hours per day in what appears to be 'vacuum grazing'. They extend the tongue out of the mouth and curl it to the side in what appears to be the action that cattle use to grasp a sward of grass and pull it into the mouth, but the calves do this simply in the air, without the tongue contacting any physical object..\\"  Pigs  A similar vacuum activity to tongue rolling is 'vacuum chewing' by pigs. In this behaviour, pigs perform all the activities associated with chewing but with no substrate in their mouth. This abnormal behaviour can represent 52‚Äì80% of all stereotyped behaviours.

She was formerly known as SS West Arrow when she was launched for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) during World War I. The ship was inspected by the United States Navy for possible use as USS West Arrow (ID-2585) but was neither taken into the Navy nor ever commissioned under that name. West Arrow was built in 1918 for the USSB, as a part of the West boats, a series of steel-hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort. Information about her early career is largely absent, but by the 1920s, news reports revealed that the ship was sailing on the North Atlantic. By the mid-1920s, West Arrow was sailing for American Diamond on their cargo service to Rotterdam and Antwerp. In 1935, American Diamond changed the ship's name to Black Osprey and the ship continued in Rotterdam service. After the outbreak of World War II, Black Osprey, still under the registry of the still-neutral United States, was detained twice by British authorities, before the U.S.-established \\"Neutrality Zone\\" ended Black Ospreys Dutch service in late 1939. Sailing under charter to the Isthmian Line in 1940, Black Osprey called at various ports in the Pacific Ocean. American Diamond sold Black Osprey to the British Ministry of War Transport in late 1940. During the ship's first transatlantic crossing under the British flag, she was sunk by on 18 February 1941, with the loss of 25 men. The 11 survivors were picked up by a Norwegian ship and landed in at Barry.  Design and construction  The West ships were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States for the USSB for emergency use during World War I. All were given names that began with the word West, like West Arrow, one of some 24 West ships built by Skinner & Eddy of Seattle, Washington.Skinner & Eddy was an emergency shipyard that only operated from 1916 until about 1920. West Arrow (Skinner & Eddy No. 12) was laid down on 20 September 1917 under the name Jas. G. Eddy, launched as West Arrow on 19 January 1918, and completed on 26 February 1918. The ship was , and was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam. West Arrow had a steel hull and a deadweight tonnage of . The ship had a single steam turbine that drove her single screw propeller, and moved the ship at a pace.  Career  West Arrow was inspected by the 13th Naval District of the United States Navy after completion and was assigned the identification number of 2585. Had she been commissioned, she would have been known as USS West Arrow (ID-2585), but the Navy neither took over the ship nor commissioned her. Little is known of West Arrows early career, with almost no information regarding her World War I activities. During that war, many of the West ships carried grain products to the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, but it is not known whether West Arrow did so or not. One early mention of West Arrow in contemporary news accounts is found in The Washington Post, which reported in February 1921 that the cargo ship had delivered 742 \\"milch cows\\" to Bremen as a gift from American farmers from Texas and Kansas. The New York Times reported in September 1923 that West Arrow, heading from Liverpool to Boston, had been struck by the White Star Line ocean liner west of Queenstown, Ireland. Haverford, headed from Philadelphia to Liverpool with passengers, struck the cargo ship on the port side, from the bow. A radio dispatch from West Arrow reported that she was proceeding under her own power and was not taking on any water. By March 1926, West Arrow was sailing for American Diamond LinesAmerican Diamond Lines was founded by the United States Shipping Board for cargo service between the United States and Rotterdam and Antwerp, and was managed from about 1920 by the Black Diamond Steamship Company of New York. See: in New York ‚Äì Rotterdam service on a U.S. government-subsidized mail route. In July 1932, the ship was moved to a new Baltimore ‚Äì Antwerp route, but by December 1934 was again sailing to Rotterdam. In 1935, American Diamond changed the name of West Arrow to Black Osprey, which remained on the Rotterdam route into 1936. In March of that year, The Wall Street Journal‚Äîreporting on a large gold shipment from the United States to Holland‚Äîspeculated that Black Osprey was the ship that had been selected to carry $345,000 of gold for export. On 24 March 1938,List of shipwrecks in 1938 Black Osprey was sailing in a dense fog off St. Catherine's Point on the Isle of Wight when she struck the British cargo ship Chagford, which sank within five minutes. Three of Chagford‚Ä≤s six-man crew were picked up by Black Osprey, whose crew searched in vain for three hours for the other three men. After the fog lifted, the Chagford survivors were transferred to a fishing vessel that landed the crewmen, and Black Osprey resumed her Rotterdam ‚Äì Philadelphia journey. World War II After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Black Osprey, still registered in the neutral-United States, was seized by British authorities on 6 September and detained at Weymouth. After carefully inspecting the ship for any contraband, the British released the ship after a week. However, on 31 October, the British again seized Black Osprey, and had not yet released her by 8 November, when the U.S. State Department released a list of 40 American ships that had been detained by belligerents. The United States established a \\"Neutrality Zone\\"‚Äîa zone where American-flagged ships could not enter‚Äîin late 1939. As a result, American Diamond was unable to continue its Dutch route, and chartered the eight vessels it employed in that service (which included Black Osprey) to other U.S. companies. Black Osprey was one of several chartered to the Isthmian Line, and made voyages in the Pacific, calling at ports such as Singapore and Honolulu in 1940. After a typhoon with winds in excess of hit Wake Island in early October, Black Osprey was diverted through heavy seas to check on the welfare of the 35 men on the island, all found to be safe. In November, American Diamond sought the permission of the United States Maritime Commission (USMC), a successor to the United States Shipping Board, to sell Black Osprey and seven other ships to the British. The USMC granted the permission, and Black Osprey was sold to the Ministry of War Transport for operation by the Cairn Line of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, for about $50 per deadweight ton, or around $440,000. The deal was completed before Black Ospreys 10 December sailing from Philadelphia to Baltimore under the British flag. Black Osprey then sailed from Baltimore on 25 January 1941 for Halifax, where she arrived on 30 January. Black Osprey, loaded with a cargo of steel, joined convoy HX 107 that sailed from that port for Liverpool on 3 February. After falling behind in the convoy, Black Osprey was torpedoed by U-96 under the command of Fregattenkapit√§n Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock at 02:27 on 18 February south of Iceland, near position . The ship's master and 24 crewmen died in the attack. Black Ospreys 11 survivors were picked up by the Norwegian refrigerated cargo ship Mosdale and landed at Barry.

President Ulysses S. Grant attended the dedication of its first building in 1876, the first time a sitting United States President had attended a synagogue service. The original structure is the oldest surviving synagogue building in Washington, D.C., and today the Lillian & Albert Small Jewish Museum. History  Founding  In 1869, about thirty Jewish immigrant families resigned from Washington Hebrew Congregation, the only Jewish congregation then in Washington, D.C., to form a more traditional, or Orthodox, alternative: Adas Israel (Congregation of Israel). These men and women sought a worship service more akin to the one they remembered from Europe, objecting to that congregation's move toward Reform Judaism. For several years, they met in rented rooms and struggled to raise funds to build their own synagogue.  Affiliation  For the Jewish community, Adas Israel was a center of traditional worship. Its constitution affirmed the Orthodox religious practices to which members were committed and forbade religious reforms from ever being made. Prayers were read in Hebrew, with the exception of the prayer for the government, which could be recited in English after being read in Hebrew. A minyan (prayer service attended by at least ten men) took place daily. As time went on, however, services began to change from the original forms. For example, English was introduced into the services, at first to translate prayers. In the late 1920s, Adas Israel affiliated with the Conservative movement, and has remained a Conservative congregation since. Initially, Adas Israel followed Orthodox tradition with separate seating for men and women, but discontinued the practice in 1951.Rabinowitz, Stanley. The Assembly: A Century in the Life of the Adas Israel Hebrew Congregation of Washington, D.C. Hoboken, New Jersey: Ktav Publishing House, Inc., 1993. Today, Adas Israel ‚Äúaspires to perpetuate Judaism, to enrich the lives of our members to celebrate Conservative Judaism at its creative best, and to bring Jews closer to God.‚Äù Adas Israel is a congregation focused on social consciousness and Jewish activism, sponsoring many community service projects. The congregation also provides many different means of being involved with Judaism. On Shabbat, as many as seven different services are held. These include traditional services, havurah, an egalitarian minyan, potlucks for young professionals, and the Ruach Minyan.  Role in the city  Adas Israel has played an important role in the nation's capital from its founding. President Ulysses S. Grant and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, Thomas White Ferry, attended the three-hour Orthodox dedication service on June 9, 1876. This was the first time a sitting U.S. president had attended a synagogue service. Local newspapers frequently reported on synagogue services and other communal events. Bat and Bar mitzvot, weddings, the High Holidays, Purim plays, and Passover celebrations all occasioned public notice. When President William McKinley was shot and killed by an assassin in Buffalo in 1901, the congregation convened a special service in his memory. In 1963 Adas Israel was the first synagogue to be addressed by civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. President Lyndon Johnson attended a Thanksgiving Day service following the assassination of his predecessor, John F. Kennedy, in 1963. This interfaith service included a sermon by Rabbi Stanley Rabinowitz. That night, Johnson paraphrased Rabinowitz's words in a nationally televised address, speaking of how blessings can come from evil situations. Following Yitzhak Rabin‚Äôs assassination in 1995, Vice President Al Gore and members of the Cabinet and Supreme Court attended a memorial service at Adas Israel. Other notable speakers at Adas Israel have included Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, Israeli Prime Ministers Golda Meir and Yitzhak Rabin, Senator Robert F. Kennedy. and President Barack Obama.  Buildings   First building (1876‚Äì1908)  Original Adas Israel synagogue located at 3rd and G Streets, NW After years of planning and fundraising, the congregation completed and dedicated its first synagogue building just in time for the nation's Centennial celebration‚Äîproviding a strong and symbolic presence for Jewish immigrants. The synagogue stood at the corner of 6th and G Streets, NW, in the heart of the city's residential and commercial center, where many of the congregants lived and worked. An influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe and Russia swelled the congregation's numbers. The congregation continued in the original synagogue until 1908, when a new building at Sixth and I Streets, NW, was dedicated. The original building was sold to Stephen Gatti, an Italian fruit dealer and real estate investor who lived a block away. In the 1910s, Saint Sophia's Greek Orthodox Church worshipped in the second-floor sanctuary. A succession of churches followed in the 1920s to 1940s. During the course of the next 60 years, the former synagogue's first floor was divided into retail spaces and housed a bicycle shop, barber, Joseph Funger's grocery store, Anthony Litteri's delicatessen, and other businesses. In the 1960s, plans for the construction of Metro headquarters threatened the building with demolition. With the support of federal and city agencies, the Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington saved the building and moved it three city blocks to Third and G Streets, NW. On September 1, 1969, President Richard Nixon signed a law authorizing the District to purchase the building and lease it to the Society for historic preservation purposes‚Äîat $1 a year for 99 years. The historic synagogue building was restored by the Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington and became the home to the Lillian & Albert Small Jewish Museum. The synagogue building is Washington's oldest surviving synagogue building. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the D.C. Inventory of Historic Sites, and the Historic American Buildings Survey. It is among the oldest synagogue buildings still standing in the United States. It is also an official project of the Save America's Treasures program. In 2016, the building was moved 60 feet; in January 2019 it was moved again, one block down G Street Northwest, to F Street Northwest to a location where it will become part of a much larger Capital Jewish Museum.  Second building (1908‚Äì51)  Sixth and I Historic Synagogue After outgrowing its original building at Sixth and G Streets, NW, the congregation constructed a new structure at Sixth and I Streets, NW. The cornerstone was laid in 1906. Architect Louis Levi of Baltimore designed the building in the Moorish style that was popular for synagogue architecture at the time. The building was dedicated on January 5, 1908. While at Sixth and I, the congregation grew vastly. Consequently, in 1943 the congregation purchased land for a new building on Connecticut Avenue, NW, outside the city's center core. In 1951, the congregation moved to its current location at Connecticut Avenue and Porter Street, NW. The Sixth and I building was purchased and occupied by the Turner Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Church. In 2002, when Turner moved to Hyattsville, Maryland, and offered the building for sale, Laura Cohen Apelbaum, current director of the Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington, appealed to the Jewish community to save the building. Three real estate developers, Shelton Zuckerman, Abe Pollin, and Douglas Jemal, placed a winning bid of $5 million on the property. Today, the former Adas Israel building is known as the Sixth and I Historic Synagogue and serves as a hub of religious and cultural Jewish life for young professionals in Washington. The space also hosts many popular book talks and concerts by locally and nationally recognized authors and performers each year.  Current building (1951‚Äìpresent)  Current location of Adas Israel synagogue at 2850 Quebec Street, NW in Cleveland Park In the 1930s and 1940s, Adas Israel's members began to move uptown. The congregation initially intended to purchase land at Connecticut Avenue and Ellicott Street, NW. When that site was deemed too small, a larger triangular site at Connecticut and Porter Street, NW, was found and determined to be suitable. The congregation, led by longtime President Joseph Wilner, built a large new facility at Connecticut Avenue and Quebec Street, NW, in the Cleveland Park neighborhood, in 1951. Architects Frank Grad and Sons designed the building in a style favored by many synagogues built after the Second World War: clean lines, large scale, and bright interiors. The cornerstone for the new building was laid in 1950; the building was dedicated later that year. The new Adas Israel, which cost nearly $1.3 million, included a 300-seat chapel, two social auditoriums, 14 classrooms and a 1,500-seat sanctuary with a balcony, a hidden choir loft, an organ, an Ark framed in black onyx and marble, and five heavy bronze doors which opened onto a lobby decorated in red marble that led to a large, open plaza overlooking the intersection. A large engraved menorah‚Äîchosen as a symbol of Judaism after much debate within the congregation‚Äîgraces the fa√ßade facing the plaza. Morris Gewirz, for whom one of the building's auditoriums was named (the other was named for his site commission co-chair Abraham Kay), declared, ‚ÄúThis great edifice stands like a mighty colossus of spiritual strength.‚Äù The school wing and auditoriums were added in 1958. Adas Israel further renovated and expanded the building in 1988. It rededicated the building in 1990, with a speech by former Israeli Ambassador Abba Eban. The building underwent major renovations in 2013.  People   Notable clergy and staff  For the congregation's first several years, paid hazzanim (cantors) and volunteers from within the congregation met worship needs. This practice was in keeping with the Jewish tradition of forming congregations and often conducting worship without religious functionaries. The first cantor, Joseph A. Cohen, served briefly in 1872‚Äì73. Adas Israel's second cantor, Jacob Voorsanger, attended the Jewish Theological Seminary in Amsterdam before immigrating to the United States in 1873. Voorsanger, who served from 1876 to 1877, left Adas Israel after only one year. He later gained fame as the rabbi of San Francisco's leading Reform congregation, Temple Emanu-El. During the early years, the congregation asked clergy to fill multiple duties, including as teachers and even as shochets (ritual butcher). One shochet aroused criticism for teaching classes in his bloody clothing. In 1898, Adas Israel hired Morris Mandel, who had been in the third graduating class of the Jewish Theological Seminary, as its first rabbi. He became Adas Israel's first clergyman trained in the United States. Many members objected to his hiring, and generally to having a rabbi, as shown in this excerpt from the congregation minutes of August 23, 1898: ‚ÄúMr. Lewis wished to know what functions Mr. Mandel was to perform, whether Rabbi or Teacher? The President answered that he was Rabbi and teacher both. Mr. M. Roginsky and Mr. Isaac Levy . . . objected to having a rabbi.‚Äù Rabbi Julius Loeb served the congregation from 1901 to 1906. Ordained in 1889 at the Yeshiva in Brisk (Brest-Litovsk), Russia, he immigrated to the United States in 1890. In response to the changing congregation, which had many members newly arrived from Eastern Europe who did not speak English, he delivered sermons in Yiddish. The first three decades of the 20th century saw a multitude of rabbis, some remaining with the congregation for under a year. Adas Israel hired clergy for one-year terms until the 1940s. Lithuanian-born Solomon Metz took over as rabbi in 1930 and remained until 1951‚Äîbecoming Adas Israel's first long-term rabbi. Louis Novick was cantor from 1923 to 1946, followed by Jacob Barkin from 1946 to 1958. Barkin performed in many concerts, secular and religious, appearing with the National Symphony Orchestra many times. While at Adas Israel, he received an offer to join the Metropolitan Opera, but he turned it down so he could continue being a cantor. In 1951, Baltimore-born Rabbi David Panitz replaced Metz. He departed in 1959, serving Temple Emanuel in Paterson, New Jersey, until 1988. In 1960, Rabbi Stanley Rabinowitz was hired from Minneapolis, and remained the senior rabbi for 26 years, also serving as president of the Rabbinical Assembly (a national organization of Conservative Jewish rabbis). Cantor Arnold Saltzman (now a rabbi) served the congregation for 24 years, beginning in the early 1980s. Rabbi Jeffrey Wohlberg succeeded Rabinowitz following his retirement in 1986. Like Rabinowitz, Wohlberg served as president of the Rabbinical Assembly. Under his leadership, the congregation created the Garden of the Righteous program to honor righteous Gentiles who rescued Jews during the Holocaust. Today Gil Steinlauf serves as Senior Rabbi, a position he has held since 2008. Adas Israel is the only synagogue that has ever had three national presidents of the North American Association of Synagogue Executives (NAASE): Abe Shefferman, Sandy Cohen, and Glenn Easton.  Congregants  Most of Adas Israel's founders came from various German and Central European states. A minority‚Äîaround a fourth‚Äîcame from Poland or other parts of the Russian Empire. Most listed their occupations as merchants and lived above or near their shops. Many families had more than four children. Most members of the congregation had lived in the nation's capital for more than ten years by the time the synagogue was dedicated. Roughly 35 families began the congregation. Some of their descendants attend Adas Israel today. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, many Eastern European Jews arrived in Washington and joined Adas Israel. Meanwhile, Yiddish replaced German and English as the language recorded in the congregation's board minutes. So many new congregants joined that Adas Israel outgrew its first building and relocated in 1908. Arthur Welsh, the United States' first Jewish aviator and an employee of the Wright brothers, was married at Adas Israel in 1907. He died in a crash while testing a plane for the Wright brothers in College Park, Maryland, on June 11, 1912. Welsh is buried in Adas Israel's cemetery in Southeast Washington. In 1912, the congregation listed 186 members (families) on its rolls. By 1934 the congregation's membership rolls had grown to 354, and expanded further two years later to around 400, then 480 in 1938, 512 in 1939, 530 in 1940, 607 in 1944, and 777 in 1948. This rapid growth reflected the influx of Jews into Washington to work for the federal government during the New Deal, World War II, and beyond. A 1940 membership survey found that 85 percent of the congregants lived above U Street, NW, and west of 16th Street, NW. This finding resulted in the congregation moving to its current building in Cleveland Park. From the time Congressman Sol Bloom joined in 1926, Adas Israel has had its share of prominent congregants. Many members of Congress, Cabinet officials, and federal employees have been members of Adas Israel. Israeli Ambassador Yitzhak Rabin and his wife Leah worshiped at Adas Israel during his tenure as ambassador to the United States. So have many of their successors. A membership survey in 1965 revealed that Adas Israel had 1,132 families with 478 children enrolled in its school. Many of the Washington area's prominent Jews were among the synagogue's members. That remains true today, as does Adas Israel's status as the capital city's largest Conservative congregation. Today Adas Israel has 1,450 households as members, with 350 children enrolled in the religious school and 200 in the nursery school.  Affinity groups and institutions   Cemetery  Adas Israel established a cemetery at 1400 Alabama Avenue, SE, in 1869, the year of the congregation's founding. Among the notable burials in the cemetery are Arthur Welsh, the country's first Jewish aviator; Stephen Theodore Norman, the grandson of Theodor Herzl; and the noted neoconservative commentator Irving Kristol.  Religious school  By 1872, before the synagogue was built, the young Adas Israel Congregation held religious classes for boys and girls for two hours in the afternoon, several times a week. Members typically paid $1.00 a month for each child's tuition. During the early years, the congregation had difficulty maintaining a school. By 1925, though, 227 students were enrolled in the school. That number grew to 320 by 1939. Because of space concerns, the school had to meet outside the synagogue, including at the Jewish Community Center on 16th Street, NW. The entire school first met in one place when Adas Israel built its Cleveland Park synagogue in 1951. The congregation held its first Bat Mitzvah in 1962. In 1973 the Congregation began the short-lived Tel Shalom summer camp in West Virginia for fourth to tenth graders. Adas Israel today also runs Gan HaYeled, a nursery school for children younger than five years old. The Melvin Gelman Religious School teaches students in grades K-12, with Ma'a lot DC allowing teenagers to continue studying following their bar and bat mitzvahs.  Sisterhood  The Adas Israel Ladies‚Äô Auxiliary organized officially in 1898 and elected Julia Oppenheimer, wife of congregation president Simon Oppenheimer, as its first president. Newspaper articles provide accounts of Sisterhood activities‚Äîfrom lectures and music performances to strawberry fairs and picnics that raised money for the congregation. Today the organization is known as the Sisterhood. Members of the Sisterhood have long played a major role in the National Women's League.  Brotherhood/Men‚Äôs Club  Adas Israel's Brotherhood first formed in 1941, with Irvin Goldstein serving as its first president. It later took the name Men's Club, which it holds today. Three Adas Israel members, Max Goldberg, Jacob Lish, and Mark Berlin, have served as national Men's Club presidents.  Other groups  Adas Israel held its first Havurah (self-led) service in 1972, the first at any Conservative Jewish congregation. It also held its first self-led study group that year. Since then, Adas Israel has had a wide variety of lay-led groups, including the egalitarian minyan, Ruach Minyan, and groups for young professionals and senior citizens.

The album was recorded in 1999, released on January 25, 2000, and features cover art from the video game Microsurgeon. Background and production The Anniversary formed by vocalist and guitarists Josh Berwanger and Justin Roelofs while they were in high school from the remnants their local pop punk bands. The first song they wrote was written with a Moog synthesizer in mind. The pair had the idea of bringing in a female keyboardist, at which point Adrianne Verhoeven joined the group;Masley 2001, p. 28 Verhoeven would later also tackle lead vocals. The band held their first show in 1997 in the basement of Berwanger's mother's house. When the members went to college, drummer Christian Jankowski and bassist James David joined the band. The Get Up Kids bassist Rob Pope sought out the band in 1999 with the intention of releasing their debut on Heroes & Villains Records, an imprint of independent label Vagrant Records that was owned by the Get Up Kids. Berwanger had been friends with Pope for a few years prior to the formation of his or Pope's bands. The band spent some time playing supporting slots for the likes of the Pulsars, Superchunk and Helium. Designing a Nervous Breakdown was recorded at Kingsize Soundlabs in Chicago, Illinois. Sessions were held in July 1999 and produced by David Trumfio, who also acted as engineer and mixer. The recordings were mastered by Ramon Breton at Oceanview Mastering. Composition Designing a Nervous Breakdown has been described as an emo indie rock and synth-pop release, with new wave and Blink-182-styled punk rock influences. The band drew comparisons to Devo, Sonic Youth, the Get Up Kids (specifically their album Something to Write Home About) and the Rentals. It incorporated frequent synthesizer usage, alongside electronic drums and group vocals. Berwanger likened their sound as a cross between Guns N' Roses and New Order. He said the majority of the tracks dealt with the topic of death.Keiper 2000, p. 20 The opening track \\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\" was reminiscent of Modest Mouse and Joan of Arc. The power pop track \\"All Things Ordinary\\" and \\"The D in Detroit\\" begin with similar guitar intros and subsequently chord progressions. \\"Perfectly\\" channeled the brooding nature of the Cure, while its outro was reminiscent of Explosions in the Sky. \\"The D in Detroit\\" was an archetypical Anniversary song: upbeat emo funneling the soul of pop punk, with flourishes of synth and Verhoeven's vocals. \\"Shu Shubat\\" incorporates the use of arpeggios. The closing track \\"Outro in No Minor\\" uses finger-picking. Release In August 1999, Designing a Nervous Breakdown was announced for release early next year. Preview clips from the album was posted on the group's website later in the month. In October, the band performed at a Heroes & Villains showcase in New York City, prior to the release of a split-single with the Get Up Kids in November. Designing a Nervous Breakdown was released on January 25, 2000. They promoted it with an east tour tour in January and February, followed by an east coast trek in March and another west coast tour in April with Love as Laughter, Hot Rod Circuit and Piebald. On a budget of $600, the band made a music video for \\"All Things Ordinary\\", which Jankowski directed. It was filmed at Oldfather Studios in Lawrence, Kansas, and took influence from 1980s music videos. The clip starts with a director coming into view and telling the band he'll change their look. Over the course of the video, the members' outfits changes from cavemen to pirates to animal costumes, before returning to their normal clothes. Some extras were invited from a party down the road to dance around the band for around 30 minutes. The group then went on a six-week of Europe with the Get Up Kids in May and June, and then an eight-week US tour with them. The band went on the Heroes & Villains Fall Tour in September and October with the Get Up Kids and Koufax; alongside this, the band and Koufax played two shows without the Get Up Kids. They took a two-week break after the trek's conclusion, before touring again until Christmas. The band received some attention when Berwanger dated actress Chlo√´ Sevigny for a brief period. In 2016, Vagrant celebrated their 20th anniversary by re-pressing their back- catalogue on vinyl, including Designing a Nervous Breakdown. To celebrate the album's 20th anniversary, the band played a few shows in early 2020 where they performed the album in its entirety. Reception Designing a Nervous Breakdown has appeared on various best-of emo album lists by A.Side TV, LA Weekly and Treblezine. Similarly, \\"The D in Detroit\\" appeared on a best-of emo songs list by Stereogum and Vulture. Designing a Nervous Breakdown received generally positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Heather Phares said the album \\"blends their skill at crafting emotional, punky-yet- melodic songs with a fondness for new-wave synths.\\" It was a \\"strong debut\\" which \\"reaffirms that traditional indie rock can still sound fresh and lively.\\" Exclaim! writer Stuart Green said the group \\"puts their predilection for Devo, Sonic Youth and goofy pop hooks to good use with a collection of ten interesting and downright catchy tracks\\". Ox-Fanzine Joachim Hiller was \\"pretty impressed\\" with the record, adding that it combined \\"contemporary pop with style elements from the early eighties without looking retro.\\" Justin W. Jones of The Phantom Tollbooth said it was an \\"incredible album that is so much more accessible than run of the mill emo bands.\\" Lawrence Journal-World writer Geoff Harkness said the band come across as \\"tight, focused and fun\\", enjoying how Verhoeven's \\"quirky chirps and riding-on-the-Metro synths\\" are placed \\"nicely with the strumming and singing\\" of Roelofs and Berwanger. Ink 19 Marcel Feldmar said the Modest Mouse-esque vocals \\"stretch and whine over a Get-Up Kids inspired explosion of straight ahead pop and electricity laden indie rock hooks.\\" Its combination of guitars that sweep \\"over rock steady rhythm[s]\\" and \\"[c]ool synth squealing\\" was a \\"good mix ... done well.\\" Pitchfork reviewer Taylor M.

Chinese \\"rainbow\\" names Chinese has three \\"rainbow\\" words, regular hong , literary didong , and ni \\"secondary rainbow\\". Note that all these Chinese characters share a graphic element of hui \\"insect; worm; reptile; etc.\\" (cf. tripled chong ), known in Chinese as Kangxi radical number 142 and loosely translated in English as the \\"insect radical\\". In traditional Chinese character classification, \\"radical- phonetic\\" or \\"phono-semantic\\" characters are statistically the most common category, and they combine a \\"radical\\" or determinative that suggests semantic field with a \\"phonetic\\" element that roughly indicates pronunciation. Words written with this radical typically name not only insects, but also reptiles, and other miscellaneous creatures, including some dragons such as shen \\"aquatic dragon\\" and jiao \\"flood dragon\\". Linguistic anthropologists studying folk taxonomy discovered many languages have zoological categories similar to hui , and coined the portmanteau word wug (from worm + bug) meaning the class of \\"insects, worms, spiders, and smaller reptiles\\". Following , \\"wug\\" is used as the English translation of the Chinese logographic radical . Hong Oracle bone script for hong \\"rainbow\\" Seal script for hong \\"rainbow\\" The regular script Chinese character for hong or jiang \\"rainbow\\" combines the \\"wug radical\\" with a gong \\"work\\" phonetic. Both Qin dynasty seal script and Zhou dynasty bronze script elaborated this same radical-phonetic combination. However, the oldest characters for \\"rainbow\\" in Shang dynasty oracle bone script were pictographs of an arched dragon or serpent with open-mouthed heads at both ends. notes, \\"In early reliefs, the rainbow is shown as a snake or a dragon with two heads. In West China they give it the head of a donkey, and it rates as a lucky symbol.\\" The (121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi dictionary, the first Chinese character dictionary, described the seal character for hong \\"rainbow\\" as \\"shaped like a wug\\". Over 18 centuries later, Hopkins described the recently discovered oracle character for . > What should we see in this simple but striking image? We should, I now feel > sure, discern a Rainbow terminating in two animal heads. But of what animal? > Certainly of the Dragon, must be the answer. For the design of the character > is, in the main, naturalistic, in so far as it is clearly modeled on the > semi-circular Bow in the sky, but symbolistic through the addition of two > heads, for where the Rainbow ends, there the Dragon begins! Hopkins elucidated. > It is the belief of the Chinese that the appearance of the Rainbow is at > once the herald and the cause of the cessation of rain and the return of > clear skies. ‚Ä¶ Now, if by his own volition, when mounting to the upper air, > the Dragon could beget the rolling thunder and the drenching rain-storm, how > should he not be able also, in descending, the cause the rain to cease, and > the face of the blue sky to clear? And that is why I conjecture and suggest > that the early Chinese must have seen in the Rainbow one avatar of the > wonder-working Dragon as conceived by their animistic mentality. That would > likewise explain why to the arching bow seen with their bodily eyes they > added the Dragon heads beheld only by the eye of faith. Jiang is an uncommon pronunciation of Ëôπ, limited to colloquial or dialectal usage, and unlike hong not normally found in compounds. For instance, caihong (with \\"color\\") \\"rainbow\\", hongcai \\"rainbow colors; iridescence; the iris; banners\\", hongqiao (with \\"bridge\\") \\"arch bridge\\", and hongxi (with \\"absorb; suck up\\") \\"siphon\\". Didong Didong or is a Classical Chinese word for \\"rainbow\\", now usually restricted to literary or historical usage. These three characters combine the \\"wug radical\\" with phonetics of zhuo \\"connect\\" or dai \\"girdle; sash\\" in di or and dong \\"east\\" in dong . Ni Ni or means \\"secondary rainbow\\" or \\"supernumerary rainbow\\", which results from double reflection of sunlight, with colors inverted from a primary rainbow (see Alexander's band). These characters combine a phonetic of er \\"child\\" with either the \\"wug radical\\" or the \\"rain radical\\" . Ni can also mean hanchan \\"winter cicada\\", which is a \\"silent, mute\\" metaphor. While hongni means \\"primary and secondary rainbows; rainbows\\", nihong is a loanword from English neon in expressions like nihongdeng \\"neon light\\", compare the chemical loanword nai \\"neon; Ne\\". Fuhong (with \\"second; subsidiary\\") means \\"secondary rainbow\\" in Chinese meteorological terminology. Early textual references Chinese classic texts dating from the Spring and Autumn period (8th‚Äì5th centuries BCE) and Warring States period (5th‚Äì3rd centuries BCE) referred to hong, didong, and ni rainbows. The Shijing has the oldest known textual usages of hong and didong, and both are bad omens. One poem uses , which is interpreted as a loan character for hong (with the \\"speech radical\\" ) \\"disorder; conflict; quarrel\\": \\"That kid with horns was truly a portent of disaster, my son!\\" Another poem begins with didong : \\"There is a girdle in the east; No one dares point at it. A girl has run away, Far from father and mother, far from brothers young and old.\\" Arthur Waley explains translating zhuo \\"spider\\" as a loan for di \\"girdle\\". > The girdle is the rainbow. Its appearance announces that someone who ought > not to is about to have a baby; for the arc of the rainbow typifies the > swelling girdle of a pregnant woman. No one dares point at it, because > pointing is disrespectful, and one must respect a warning sent by Heaven.\\" \\"Although many ancient cultures believed rainbows were good omens,\\" explains, \\"the Chinese saw them as meteorological disasters. Unlike the auspicious [long] dragon symbolizing forthcoming rain, the two-headed [hong] was inauspicious because it appeared after a rain shower.\\" The Huainanzi says both rainbows and comets were warnings from tian \\"heaven; god\\". Several classic texts (e.g., Liu Xiang's Shuoyuan and Xinxu) use the phrase baihong guan ri \\"bright rainbow threads the sun\\". For example, it is a portent of assassination in the Zhanguoce \\"a white halo pierced the sun.\\" One notable exception is the Mengzi using yunni \\"cloud and rainbow\\" to describe the legendary Tang of Shang: \\"the people looked to him, as we look in a time of great drought to the clouds and rainbows.\\" The oldest Chinese dictionary, the ca. 3rd century BCE Erya says didong was called yu \\"rain sacrifice\\", defines it as hong \\"rainbow\\", and says ni \\"secondary rainbow\\" was called qie'er \\"lift/carry two.\\" The commentary of Guo Pu notes rainbows were called yu in Jiangdong (present day Jiangsu and Zhejiang), and gives additional names of meiren \\"beautiful woman\\" and xiyi \\"split cover/screen\\". The Chuci has more rainbow occurrences (8 , 10 , and 5 ) than any other early text. It graphically interchanges ni and ni except the latter is exclusively used in yunni \\"clouds and rainbows\\" (both with the \\"cloud radical\\"). Many rainbows occur in Chuci descriptions of shamanic \\"flights\\" through the skies, frequently in contexts with other dragons, for instance : \\"To hang at my girdle the coiling Green Dragon, To wear at my belt the sinuous [] rainbow serpent ... A great [] rainbow flag Iike an awning above me, And pennants dyed in the hues of the sunset.\\" This mythical Green or Azure Dragon ruling the eastern sky and the Vermilion Bird ruling the southern sky reoccur with baini \\"Bright rainbows darting swiftly in the traces\\". The Yueling \\"Monthly Ordinances\\" section of the Liji claims hong rainbows only appear during half the year. In the last month of spring, \\"Moles are transformed into quails. Rainbows begin to appear.\\" In the first month of winter, \\"Pheasants enter the great water and become [shen] large mollusks. Rainbows are hidden and do not appear.\\" Along with the rainbow, the shen is considered to be a dragon. Yin and Yang cosmology dichotomized between primary hong \\"Yang/male rainbow\\" and secondary ni \\"Yin/female rainbow\\". analyzed ancient Chinese beliefs about rainbows, which were believed to emanate from interchanges between earthly Yin qi and heavenly Yang qi (see Shiming below). Rainbows thus symbolized a sexual union of Yin-Yang (Shijing 51 above) and a competition between male and female river gods or dragons. Eberhard explains the Chinese symbolism. > The rainbow is seen as a resplendent symbol of the union of yang and yin; it > serves therefore as an emblem of a marriage. You should never point your > finger at a rainbow. But the rainbow can have another meaning, in that it > may appear when either husband or wife is more handsome and attractive than > the other, and therefore enters upon an adulterous relationship. The rainbow > is then an emblem of fornication or sexual abuse, and forebodes ill. Like rainbows, dragons were explained in Yin-Yang theory. Rain-dragons supposedly had Yin powers since they controlled water. Edward H. Schafer says. > In China, dragon essence is woman essence. The connection is through the > mysterious powers of fertilizing rain, and its extensions in running > streams, lakes, and marshes. In common belief as in literature, the dark, > wet side of nature showed itself alternately in women and in dragons. The > great water deities of Chinese antiquity were therefore snake queens and > dragon ladies: they were avatars of dragons precisely because they were > equally spirits of the meres and mists and nimbus clouds. Etymologies The ca. 200 CE Shiming dictionary (1, Shitian \\"Explaining Heaven\\"), which defines words through phono-semantic glosses, gave the oldest Chinese \\"etymologies\\" for rainbows. *Hong \\"rainbow\\" is gong [same phonetic with the \\"beat radical\\" ] \\"attack; assault\\", [rainbows result from] pure Yang qi attacking Yin qi. *Also called didong , which always appears in the east when the sun is in the west, a [rainbow] chuoyin [same phonetic with the \\"mouth radical\\" ] \\"sucks\\" the qi from easterly water. It is called sheng \\"rise; ascend\\" when seen in the west, [rainbows] appear when the morning sun begins to \\"rise\\". *Also called meiren \\"beautiful person\\", named after times when disharmony between Yin and Yang, marital disorder, rampant immorality, men and women considering one another \\"beautiful\\", constantly chasing after each other, and such overbearing behaviors are flourishing. Using \\"etymology\\" in the usual Western sense of historical linguistics, Joseph Edkins first proposed Chinese hong \\"rainbow\\" was \\"doubtless a variant\\" of gung \\"bow\\" and compared it with \\"Siamese\\" lung \\"rainbow\\". compares Proto-Sino-Tibetan and Proto-Austro-Tai etymological proposals for hong and didong. thought *g'ung < *glung \\"rainbow (dragon)\\" and *lyung-t'lia \\"dragon\\" descended from a Proto- Sino-Tibetan *s-brong \\"wug\\" root. first thought *lyung and *g'ung were early Chinese borrowings from Proto-Austro-Tai *ru≈ã \\"dragon; rainbow\\"; but later saw *g'ung < *g'[l]u≈ã or *k[l]ung \\"rainbow\\" and *tiadtung < *tiad-[skl]ung \\"rainbow\\" (with a *tung \\"east\\" phonetic signifying \\"red part of the sky\\") as semantically related with *g'ung < *g[l]ung \\"red\\". For hong \\"rainbow\\", reconstructs Old Chinese *g√¥≈ã < *glo≈ã and compares \\"very irregular\\" dialect forms such as Proto-Min ghio≈ãB and Gan Shanggao dialect l…ënB-lu≈ãH. He lists etymological proposals of hong from Proto-Miao‚ÄìYao *klu≈ãA or Chinese long \\"dragon\\" and hong \\"red\\" (, ). For jiang \\"rainbow\\", Schuessler reconstructs *kr√¥≈ãh and notes the survival in Gan Wuning dialect k…î≈ãC1. He concludes the \\"wide range of forms\\" including didong < *t√™(t)s-t√¥≈ã < *t√™(t)s-tl√¥≈ã suggests a non-Sino-Tibetan \\"source for this etymon\\", possibly include Kam‚ÄìTai and Zhuang words like tu2-tu≈ã2 or Proto-Tai *Dru≈ã (cf. Thai ru≈ãC2 \\"rainbow\\".) Mythological parallels Tomb painting of N√ºwa and Fuxi excavated in Xinjiang. \\"Hong < *g'ung 'rainbow' has always represented a dragon to the Chinese,\\" says , \\"from Shang oracle pictographs of dicephalous sky-serpents to the modern graph with the 'wug' radical.\\" The mythic Chinese hong \\"rainbow\\" dragon has a few parallels in the natural world (two-headed snake, Rainbow Snake Farancia erytrogramma, and Rainbow Boa Epicrates cenchria) and many in comparative mythology (see rainbows in mythology and snakes in mythology). Loewenstein compares rainbow-serpent legends throughout Southeast Asia, the Pacific, Australia, Africa, and South America; and concludes: > Myths of a giant rainbow-serpent are common among primitive tribes > inhabiting the tropics. Outside the tropical belt the rainbow-serpent > concept is hardly to be found. This points to the fact that the myth must be > intimately connected with the occurrence and geographic distribution of a > particular family of snakes, the Boidae, which includes the largest > specimens in existence, namely the Pythons and the Boas. The well-known Rainbow Serpent is central to creation myths of the Indigenous Australians (translated as Chinese hongshe and Japanese nijihebi \\"rainbow snake\\"). Some other examples include: *Ayida-Weddo is a rainbow serpent loa of rainbows and fertility in Haitian Vodou *Nehebkau is a two-headed snake in Egyptian mythology *Sisiutl is a three-headed sea serpent, with one anthropomorphic and two reptilian heads, in Kwakwaka'wakw mythology *Oshunmare is a male and female rainbow serpent in Yoruba mythology Lastly, another Chinese rainbow myth involves the creator N√ºwa repairing a crack in the sky caused by the water deity Gong Gong (cf. ). She supposedly created the first rainbow by melting stones of 5 or 7 different colors to patch the sky. N√ºwa and her brother-consort Fuxi are represented as having the upper body of a human and the tail of a dragon or serpent. They are associated with yin and yang, like secondary and primary rainbows.

He was among the paid musicians in San Petronio, Bologna, from 1636 to 1641, which possibly means that he received his musical education there. He was a founding member of the Bolognese Accademia Filarmonica in 1666 and was elected its conductor in 1679. His first musical work was the opera Il Celindo which, although composed in 1674, premiered in 1677. He composed a Dixit Dominus for the annual celebration of the academy in San Giovanni in Monte on 4 July 1675. From 1680 to 1683 he was maestro di cappella of the Accademia della Morte, Ferrara, and in 1682‚Äì1683 of Ferrara Cathedral as well. In 1686 he served temporarily as maestro di cappella of San Giovanni in Monte, Bologna. From 7 July 1692 until early December 1693 he was second organist at San Petronio.

It allowed basic navigation of the Quran with the ability for the user to select a specific surah (chapter) and ayah (verse). Example of Digital Qur'an for Smartphones Translations of the Quran to other languages were also included, sometimes synchronized with the original Arabic recitations. The products were mass-produced in China at an affordable price; however this was achieved at the sacrifice of expenditure on research and development. Subsequent models introduced color screens. Since the availability of more powerful mobile devices such as smartphones, focus has shifted on the production of Quranic software for such devices rather than dedicated \\"digital Quran\\" devices.Living the Information Society in Asia; Erwin Alampay  Usage  There is debate surrounding to what degree a digital form of the Qur'an should be treated like a hard copy in terms of etiquette when reciting from it. For example, should the practices of wudu, qibla, or brushing one's teeth with a miswak be observed while reading from a digital Qur'an. Commenters speculated about how the special barakah or contagion heuristic associated with the Qur'an translates to electronic texts.\\"there may be a place on a separate portion of a believer's hard drive, apart from other forms of content of a nonreligious nature, for a digital Qur'an\\" Gary R. Bunt, iMuslims, 2009, p.87 Other observers noted that this way of thinking is foreign to the devices users, who adopt western digital technology unthinkingly.\\"But this perception is a 'western' one and not that of the Arab reader, to whom modern technology is something strange and foreign, technological containers which can be imported and used without any analysis of their actual content (Example: Digital Koran).\\" The Almost Complete Lack of the Element of \\"Futureness\\" Heise Online Myrvold (2010) summarizes the debate on how Qur'anic etexts and the devices holding them should be handled, citing a fatwa issued by the \\"Ask Imam\\" website to the effect that ritual purity should only be regarded in connection with such a device during the time Qur'anic text is actually being displayed.Kristina Myrvold, The Death of Sacred Texts: Ritual Disposal and Renovation of Texts in World Religions, 2010, p. 47, citing a 2008 fatqa at \\"askimam.com\\" phrased \\"Do You Have to Have Wudu When Handling a Digital Quran?\\" Mohammed Zakariah has come to the conclusion that it is because of the digital Qur'an that Islam has been able to spread and diversify among cultures. This has led to the expansion of Islam among people of faith, scholars who are now able to study the book and scientists that see new opportunity arise. Thomas Hoffmann also discusses in his book on new information and technologies that it is because of these new and creative ways of simplifying the Qur'an that the world sees a new wave of \\"lay\\" users rather than experts and self proclaimed experts in the field. Another Journal by Engku Alwi went to college campuses to see how the new form of technology, phone and tablet applications were seen by over 200 muslim students. This concluded that it was well received and even had good effects on recitation and memorization but that a large percentage were worried or confused o the rules of recitation when using the device.https://search.proquest.com/docview/1551172691/  As a digital Mu·π£·∏•af  A digital Qur'ƒÅn serves as a digital Mu·π£·∏•af, and faces unique challenges because of it. The critical challenges to produce a flawless digital Mu·π£·∏•af are correct encoding, correct computer typography, and facsimile rendering on all browsers, operating systems and devices. 1\\\\. Correct encoding is hampered by constraints imposed by the Unicode Standard. For instance, only recently the extra characters were encoded to represent the so-called open tanwƒ´n. Correct encoding is also hampered by the fact that input methods, i.e., keyboard layouts for Arabic, are based on modern everyday orthography, which differs from Qur'ƒÅn orthography in many respects: there are more characters used in the Qur'ƒÅn and some characters are different in terms of Unicode, such as yƒÅ' with or without dots in final position. 2\\\\. Correct computer typography is hampered by mechanisms that are lacking because the industry is not aware of the fact that they are needed. In particular the category of \\"amphibious characters\\", characters that can occur as both main letters and as diacritics depending on context, cannot be handled by conventional font layout engines. Last but not least, correct computer typography should reproduce Islamic script as accurately as possible. Unfortunately, Arabic typography has a bias to adapt or reduce itself to constraints of Western technology that was not designed to handle Arabic at all. This circumstance adds an obvious complication to the task of producing a flawless digital Qur'ƒÅn. 3\\\\. Facsimile rendering on all devices is de facto impossible with conventional computer typography, because it depends on proprietary operating systems, proprietary font layout engines and often inaccurate and incomplete Arabic typefaces. The first digital Mu·π£·∏•af that takes all these considerations into account is the Omani digital Mu·π£·∏•af: www.mushafmuscat.om, which is described in this webcast by the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Egypt: http://webcast.bibalex.org/Cast/Details.aspx?ID=11438  Recitation  Since the first digital versions of the Qur'an, more digital resources relating to the Qur'an and Islam have emerged as well. One can find videos containing Tajweed (recitation) on sites like Youtube and other sites to equip them in learning recitation. This can be helpful because both beginner and professional resources can be found and used as tools in learning the practice of Tajweed. If the digital content and context of what these followers are using is trustworthy, then listening to Tajweed online can help to provide \\"spiritual merit\\" to them. The art of Tajweed is very important in Muslim culture and if followers choose to use these online resources to explore this art, then it can enhance their prayer lives. Through the use of digital resources, a follower of Islam is given the ability to learn even if their life circumstances (work, location, health, etc.) limits them from being able to physically go somewhere to learn about the Qur'an and Islam.  Issues  An issue emerging alongside the growing usage of digital copies of the Qur'an is confirming the authenticity of digital copies. Given that the Qur'an has been maintained in its original, unedited state for fourteen centuries, maintaining this originality is against tampering is of the utmost importance for digital Qur'anic content. While hard copies of the Qur'an are meticulously examined to assure accuracy before they are made available for sale, many digital copies that are available for free on the internet are not subjected to same degree of scrutiny. Among online copies of the Qur'an, inaccuracies and tampering that have been found went gone largely unnoticed by readers of the website. Because of this, there are many proposed methods to rectify the issue of authenticity and establish a method to verify the integrity of digital Qur'anic content. One controversial method of verifying and displaying that a piece of digital Qur'anic content is authentic is the usage of digital watermarks on verified digital images of the Qur'an, which some argue is a form of modifying the Qur'an as well. Other proposed methods of ensuring authenticity include cryptography, steganography, and usage of digital signatures. Digital copies of the Qur'an can be found in many different styles of Arabic and in each style the diacritics (symbols or punctuation in Arabic writing) differ. Diacritics being misplaced or altered does not effect everyone's ability to get the correct meaning out of this text, but it does affect non-Arabic speakers' ability. One method used to try and prevent the meaning of the Qur'an from being misconstrued is the use of the Qur'an Quote Algorithm. This algorithm allows people to take a verse and search the true meaning of it by out the diacritics which could be interpreted incorrectly by non-Arabic speakers and evaluates just the words.

Mahone explains that the ceremony is attended half of the Los Angeles police force to honor fallen police officers. Nevertheless, Michael, Lincoln, and Sucre manage to infiltrate a storage room and steal police uniforms. Wyatt, following the information acquired from Bruce Bennett, arrives in Los Angeles to continue his hunt for Sara Tancredi. He sidetracks briefly to silence a former Company employee trying to leak information to Donald Self. Returning after the murder, Wyatt continues to interrogate Gretchen for information regarding Scylla and Michael, but she does not break. Michael, Lincoln, and Mahone attend the Eagles & Angels ceremony disguised as police officers, and Sucre and Bellick wait in the getaway vehicle. Michael makes his way to the card holder's table and successfully hides the downloading device. The ceremony begins, and during a moment of silence, the lost ones of the characters flash before their eyes. Unfortunately, it is at this time that the bodyguard from earlier again recognizes Lincoln and proceeds to follow him. Lincoln realizes this and leaves, only to be held at gun point outside. He is then saved by Brad Bellick, who stabs the bodyguard with a screwdriver, killing him. The Pad Man calls and instructs the card holder to leave immediately. Michael and Mahone improvise and send the card holder's bodyguard off to identify the fallen bodyguard. Michael's nose bleeds again, but he stays beside the card holder until the download is finished. During the ceremony, Sara, upon discovering Bennett's murder (disguised as a suicide), struggles to cope with grief and a sense of guilt. She rushes off to a bar and orders a drink, returning to an old habit. A man drinking near Sara snatches Bennett's credit card from Sara's bag without her knowing. When the man uses the card, Wyatt is alerted by the Company. Sara leaves without touching her drink just as Wyatt enters the bar asking for her. Although the barkeeper denied seeing Sara, Wyatt still manages to track down Sara on her way back to the warehouse and is seen following her.  Reception  IGN gave the episode 6.7/10, saying that there were multiple good moments but the \\"horribly bad dialogue and stupid character decisions\\" ensured the episode could not rise above mediocrity.

She, many years later, also sang solo, mostly wedding and Folk songs. Early life Her parents were middle-class, Punjabi of Kashmiri origin from Lahore. Her father Khwaja Nazir Ahmed, worked as a registered contractor in Lahore Municipal corporation. Early in her life, her parents wanted her to be a doctor, and provided her with the best possible education they could afford. Musarrat passed the matriculation examination (10th grade) with distinction and passed the intermediate examination (12th grade) from Kinnaird College in Lahore. Career She had keen interest in music and began singing for Radio Pakistan in the early 1950s. However, insufficient money from the radio took her to the film director, Anwar Kamal Pasha in 1955. She explained to Pasha about her strong desire to sing for the movies. Instead, Pasha suggested to her to become an actress. Musarrat needed her parents' approval. Pasha himself met Musarrat's father and convinced him to allow his daughter to work in the movie industry as a singer and actress. Anwar Kamal Pasha changed Musarrat's name to Chandani and signed her up for a side role in his movie. Hence, Chandani made her debut with Sabiha Khanum and Nayyar Sultana in Pasha's film Qatil in 1955. Her role was secondary but effective. Sheikh Lateef of Capital Films, Lahore planned to make a Punjabi film, 'Pattan (1955)'. Lateef's friend, poet and script writer, Baba Aalam Siah Posh, advised him to cast Chandani (Musarrat Nazir) in the film. Sheikh Lateef agreed. This was the debut of Musarrat Nazir in Punjabi films, with a nickname Chandani. Then Chandani appeared in the hit Punjabi film, Pattan (1955), with her real name, Musarrat Nazir. She played the lead role opposite Santosh Kumar in Pattan (1955). The producer was Sheikh Lateef and the film was directed by Luqman. The film Pattan opened the doors for Musarrat in the Punjabi film industry, which led her to the all-time hit film Patay Khan (1955). She was the supporting actress. The film was produced by film actress Shammi and Musarrat Nazir acted in a supporting role along with Noor Jehan and Aslam Pervaiz. Her main competitor actresses, in those days, were Sabiha Khanum, Yasmin and Noor Jehan. Personal life She was born in 13 October 1940. She is married to a physician Arshad Majeed and has lived in Canada since 1965. They have three grown-up children in 2005. Musarrat Nazir gave up her film career that was then at its peak for her would-be husband and agreed to move to Canada with him. Musarrat Nazir and Arshad Majeed wanted to return to Pakistan and settle in Lahore in the late 1970s. Arshad Majeed wanted to set up a hospital in Lahore and they had gone ahead and bought a home there for this purpose which they still own and maintain in 2005. After spending a lot of money, months of struggle and running around, Arshad Majeed gave up. Filmography Musarrat also gave performances in Pakistan cinema's greatest melodramas like the films Mahi Munda (1956) and Yakke Wali (1957).

In this state, they save energy during cold weather while they have limited access to food sources. Plants Deciduous trees lose their foliage in the winter. Tree growth rings are a result of winter rest, as there is rapid growth in the warmer spring, then slower growth later in the year. Perennial and biennial herbaceous plants lose their frost-sensitive, above-ground parts before the winter, and regrow in the spring. Herbaceous plants that are annual, producing seeds before the winter, can also be considered to have winter rest in some form, because their seeds may stay inactive over the winter before germinating. Annual plants which have seeds that germinate before winter also have winter rest. Winter cereals, for example, which are sown in the fall and germinate before the frost, become dormant during the winter and actually require a few weeks of cold before they are able to flower. Animals Winter rest in an animal is different from true hibernation, since the metabolism is not reduced drastically. The body temperature is not significantly lowered, however the heart rate is reduced. This means that animals like the raccoon can quickly become active again if temperatures rise or the snow melts.

A modern stage hypnosis performance typically delivers a comedic show rather than simply a demonstration to impress an audience with powers of persuasion. Apparent effects of amnesia, mood altering and hallucination may be demonstrated in a normal presentation. Stage hypnosis performances often encourage audience members to look further into the benefits of hypnotism. The causes of behaviour exhibited by volunteers in stage hypnosis shows is an area of dispute. Some claim it illustrates altered states of consciousness (i.e., \\"hypnotic trance\\"). Others maintain that it can be explained by a combination of psychological factors observed in group settings such as disorientation, compliance, peer pressure, and ordinary suggestion. Others yet allege that deception plays a part. History Stage hypnosis evolved out of much older shows conducted by Mesmerists and other performers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Scottish surgeon James Braid developed his technique of hypnosis after witnessing a stage performance by the travelling Swiss magnetic demonstrator Charles Lafontaine (1803‚Äì1892) in November 1841.\\"Magnetic demonstrator\\" ‚Äì Gauld's term (Gauld, 1992, p. 204) ‚Äì accurately describes Lafontaine; because whilst he was in the UK, he only demonstrated \\"magnetic\\" phenomena; he never used it to treat anyone at any time (in public or private).Braid always maintained that he had gone to Lafontaine's demonstration as an open-minded sceptic, eager to examine the evidence and, then, form a considered opinion of Lafontaine's work. He was neither a closed- minded cynic intent on destroying Lafontaine, nor a deluded and na√Øvely credulous believer seeking authorisation of his already formed belief (Neurypnology (1843), p. 2.For an extended account of the interactions between Braid and Lafontaine, see Yeates (2013), pp. 103‚Äì308 passim. Braid was well aware of similar performances by \\"electro-biologists\\" in his day;\\"Electrobiology: A mode of inducing hypnotism by having the subject look steadily at metallic disks. The process originated about the middle of the nineteenth century, and its fame was spread by numerous lecturers in England and the United States.\\", Melton, J.G. [2001] (ed), Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology (Fifth Edition), in Two Volumes, Volume 1 (A-L), Thomson Gale, (Farmington Hills), 2001, p. 489. e.g., Braid published the contents of an advertising hand-bill for an \\"electro-biology\\" performance by a visiting American, George W. Stone,Stone was the compiler and editor of The Philosophy of Electro-Biology, or Electrical Psychology, in a Course of Nine Lectures, Delivered by J. B. Dods, before the United States Senate, at Washington, in 1850, etc. Stone was also involved, for a time, in the active promotion the medium, Maria Basheba Hayden (1826‚Äì1883), the wife of his close friend, William Richardson Hayden, M.D. (1820‚Äì1903), journalist, and editor of The Boston Atlas, and a monthly newsletter called The Star Spangled Banner. Maria Hayden, who graduated M.D. in 1865, also assisted Augustus De Morgan in his paranormal investigations. on 12 March 1851, which, as well as clearly emphasising that Stone was claiming to use volunteers from the audience, rather than his own stooges/assistants, details some of the phenomena that Stone's audience might have expected to have displayed to them. > Persons in a perfectly wakeful state, of well-known character and standing > in society, who come forward voluntarily from among the audience, will be > experimented upon.

These are identical to many of the demonstrations which became central to subsequent \\"stage hypnosis\\", in fact it seems that little changes except the name and the introduction of the hypnotic induction, etc. Likewise, the novelist Mark Twain similarly recounts a Mesmeric performance which clearly resembles 20th century stage hypnosis, in his autobiography. The absence of any reference to \\"hypnotism\\" in these early performances, indeed before the term was coined, and the fact that they often lacked anything resembling a modern hypnotic induction is consistent with the skeptical view, that stage hypnosis is primarily the result of ordinary suggestion rather than hypnotic trance. Indeed, early performers often claimed that they were influencing their subjects by means of telepathy and other supernatural powers. Others, however, were delivering performances that displayed the wide range of hypnotic manifestations to their audiences. In the United States, for example, in the 1890s, there was a small group of highly skilled stage hypnotists, all whom were managed by Thomas F. Adkin, who toured country-wide, playing to packed houses. Adkin's group included Sylvain A. Lee,Author of The Practice of Hypnotic Suggestion (1901). One of his specialties was hypnotising per medium of the telephone; poster at Mr. and Mrs. Herbert L. Flint,Herbert L. Flint was the author of Flint's lessons in hypnotism; a comprehensive work on scientific suggestion as applied in hypnotism, mesmerism, personal magnetism, magnetic healing, psycho-therapeutics, suggestive therapeutics and similar manefestations of mental development and control (1915); poster at and Professor Xenophon LaMotte Sage.Author of Hypnotism as It Is: a Book for Everybody (1897). Xenophon LaMotte Sage was the stage name of E. Virgil Neal; see Conroy, (2009), passim, especially pp. 27‚Äì40. 20th century Throughout the 20th century, despite adopting the term \\"hypnotism\\", stage hypnotists continued to explain their performances to audiences by reference to supernatural powers and animal magnetism. Ormond McGill, e.g., in his Encyclopedia of the subject wrote in 1996 that: > Some have called this powerful transmission of thought from one person to > another \\"thought projection\\". The mental energy used appears to be of two > types: magnetic energy ... generated within the body and telepathic energy > generated within the mind. ... The two work together as a unit in applying > Power Hypnosis. The operation of the two energies in combination is what > Mesmer referred to as \\"animal magnetism\\".Ormond McGill, The New Encyclopedia > of Stage Hypnosis, 1996: 24 However, this is not what Braid meant by \\"hypnotism\\", a term coined in opposition to theories of Mesmerism, to stress the fact that the results were due to ordinary psychological and physiological processes, such as suggestion and focused attention, rather than telepathy or animal magnetism. Indeed, after meeting with Mr. Stone, experimenting with his own subjects, and presenting his findings on such performances to the Royal Institution, Braid concludes, > There is, therefore, both positive and negative proof in favour of my mental > and suggestive theory, and in opposition to the magnetic, occult, or > electric theories of the Mesmerists and electro-biologists.

(1851). Electro-Biological Phenomena, etc., p. 530. However, modern stage performers often continue to misuse the word \\"hypnosis\\" in describing their shows and encourage misconceptions about hypnotism by confusing it with Mesmerism for dramatic effect. Skepticism Catalepsy: \\"the human bridge\\". Mesmeric and other stage performances changed their names to \\"stage hypnotist\\" in the 19th century. They had originally claimed to produce the same effects by means of telepathy and animal magnetism, and only later began to explain their shows in terms of hypnotic trance and suggestion. Hence, many of the precursors of stage hypnosis did not employ hypnotic induction techniques. Moreover, several modern stage performers have themselves published criticisms which suggest that stage hypnosis is largely the result of sleight of hand, ordinary suggestion, and social compliance, etc., rather than hypnotic trance. Most notably, the well-known American magician and performer, Kreskin, has frequently carried out typical stage hypnosis demonstrations without using any hypnotic induction. After working as a stage hypnotist and magician for nearly two decades, Kreskin became a skeptic and a whistleblower from within the stage hypnosis field. > For nineteen years I had believed in ... the sleeplike \\"hypnotic trance,\\" > practicing it constantly. Though I had nagging doubts at times, I wanted to > believe in it. There was an overpowering mystique about putting someone to > sleep, something that set me and all other \\"hypnotists\\" apart. We were > marvellous Svengalis or Dr. Mesmers, engaged in a supernatural practice of > sorts. Then it all collapsed. For me anyway.Kreskin, The Amazing World of > Kreskin, 1973: 143. After experimenting with his own subjects for several years until he was satisfied he could perform \\"stage hypnosis\\" without any hypnotic induction or trance, he concluded, \\"The battle of semantics may be waged for years, but I firmly believe that what is termed 'hypnosis' is, again, a completely normal, not abnormal, response to simple suggestion.\\" An outspoken skeptic regarding stage hypnosis, Kreskin not only actively debunked stage hypnotists' claims, but went so far as to offer a substantial monetary reward, $25,000, to anyone who could prove the existence of hypnotic trance. The reward has been unsuccessfully challenged three times.Kreskin, The Amazing World of Kreskin, 1973: 152 While debunking the \\"sleep-trance\\" concept, Kreskin, like other skeptics adopting the nonstate position, was keen to emphasise that he felt the value of hypnotic suggestion had been frequently underestimated. Role of deception Due to stage hypnotists' showmanship, many people believe that hypnosis is a form of mind control. However, the effects of stage hypnosis are probably due to a combination of relatively ordinary social psychological factors such as peer pressure, social compliance, participant selection, ordinary suggestibility, and some amount of physical manipulation, stagecraft, and trickery. The desire to be the centre of attention, having an excuse to violate their own inner fear suppressors and the pressure to please are thought to convince subjects to \\"play along\\".Wagstaff, Graham F. (1981) Hypnosis, Compliance and Belief, St. Martin's Press, New York. Books written by stage hypnotists sometimes explicitly describe the use of deception in their acts. For example, Ormond McGill's New Encyclopedia of Stage Hypnosis describes an entire \\"fake hypnosis\\" act which depends upon the use of private whispers throughout: > [The hypnotist whispers off-microphone:] \\"We are going to have some good > laughs on the audience and fool them ... so when I tell you to do some funny > things, do exactly as I secretly tell you. Okay? Swell.\\" (Then deliberately > wink at the spectator in a friendly fashion.)McGill, Ormond. (1996) The New > Encyclopedia of Stage Hypnosis, p. 506. According to experts such as Theodore X. Barber and Andr√© Muller Weitzenhoffer, stage hypnosis traditionally employs three fundamental strategies: # Participant compliance. Participants on stage tend to be compliant because of the social pressure felt in the situation constructed on stage, before an expectant audience. # Participant selection. Preliminary suggestion tests, such as asking the audience to clasp their hands and suggesting they cannot be separated, are usually used to select out the most suggestible and socially compliant subjects from the audience. By asking for volunteers to mount the stage, the performer also tends to select the most extraverted members of the audience. # Deception of the audience. Stage hypnotists are performers who traditionally, but not always, employ a variety of \\"sleight of hand\\" strategies to mislead their audience for dramatic effect. The strategies of deception employed in traditional stage hypnosis can be categorised as follows: # Off-microphone whispers. The hypnotist lowers his microphone and whispers secret instructions to the participant on stage, outside the audience's hearing. These may involve requests to \\"play along\\" or fake hypnotic responses.Barber, Spanos & Chaves. Hypnotism: Imagination & Human Potentialities (1974), p. 105. # Failure to challenge. The stage hypnotist pretends to challenge subjects to defy a suggestion, for example, \\"You cannot stand up out of your chair because your backside is stuck down with glue.\\" However, no specific cue is given to the participants to begin their effort (\\"Start trying now!\\"). This creates the illusion that a specific challenge has been issued and effort made to defy it. # Fake hypnosis tricks. Stage hypnosis literature contains a large repertoire of sleight of hand tricks, of the kind used by professional illusionists. None of these tricks requires any hypnosis or suggestion, but depend purely on physical manipulation and audience deception. The most famous example of this type is the \\"human plank\\" trick, which involves making a subject's body become rigid (cataleptic) and suspending them horizontally between two chairs, at which point the hypnotist will often stand upon their chest for dramatic effect. This has nothing to do with hypnosis, but simply depends on the fact that when subjects are positioned in the correct way they can support more weight than the audience tends to assume. # Stooges. Several experts, including Kreskin, have stated that stage hypnotists have been known to make use of stooges (also called horses) who travel from show to show. A stage hypnotist may only require a single stooge because by using him first for each demonstration real subjects from the audience will tend to follow his lead and imitate his responses. Moreover, for the climax of the show, the hypnotist will often focus on one or two subjects to demonstrate more difficult and dramatic responses involving apparent hallucinatory experiences. A single stooge can be used for this purpose.Kreskin. The Amazing World of Kreskin (1973), p. 149.Weitznehoffer, Andre. The Practice of Hypnotism (2000), p. 400. Weitzenhoffer writes: > Having not only had a chance to watch famous stage hypnotists of the 1940s > and 50s such as [Ralph] SlaterReal name Joseph Bolsky (see (\\"Dr. Wilbur\\" is > Cornelia B. Wilbur), and ). and Polgar at work but having also had a chance > to have fairly extensive personal contact with other stage hypnotists, I > believe I can throw some light upon the situation. To begin with, one should > be aware that many stage hypnotists use stooges or plants. On the other hand, those who argue for a substantial \\"state\\" of hypnosis cite clinical claims (not actually evidenced in any case of stage performance, one hopes) such as the following: \\"...editorial implying most subjects have no will or interest in not following the suggestion of the hypnotist, conveniently omit the primary interest in hypnotism came in the early 1800s before ether and morphine were widely available. Thousands of extremely painful operations were performed through the use of hypnosis. Patients awoke without memory of the surgery and even healed much faster than those who endured the extreme pain without hypnosis. Sigmund Freud was directly responsible for removing hypnosis from psychotherapy because of so many reports that patients also had intuitions about conditions of patients they had never met while in the trance state.\\" Such arguments originate in the work of James Esdaile at a medical mission in India, recounted in his book of 1847. This was before the concept of \\"hypnotism\\" (only recently promoted by Braidin 1843) had spread and Esdailes work was still referred to as \\"Mesmerism\\". Whilst Esdaile claimed his patients felt no pain observers on behalf of an independent commission of enquiry for the Bengal government reported scenes of those undergoing such operations writhing in agony. Regarding more recent claims of painless surgery, Barber, among others, has pointed out that detail in accounts of such surgery admit that patients are, even though not unconscious, rendered stuporous by cocktails of anxiolytics. Moreover, the proportion of patients capable of undergoing such procedures (attaining sufficiently \\"deep\\" \\"hypnosis\\") is as small as the percentage of the population who are capable of undergoing surgery with neither chemical nor hypnotic assistance, inviting the suspicion that these groups of \\"special\\" patients overlap. Moreover, Barber also points out that invariably, cases of hypnotic surgery do use local anaesthetic at the area of incision, whilst internal organs are not capable of registering pain in response to a skilled cut rendering many such operations feasible without general anaesthetic, the role of hypnotic influence being essentially at an emotional or anxiolytic level. Furthermore, far from there being \\"thousands\\" of such cases of hypno- anaesthesia in surgery it remains sufficiently rare as to warrant the attention of news reports when it occurs. As rare, indeed, as the exceptional individuals able to undergo such surgery. However, none of the foregoing debate about hypnotic procedures in a clinical setting has any bearing upon stage hypnosis. Role of hypnotist and subject  Hypnotist  A stage hypnotist and his subjects Due to stage hypnotists' showmanship and their perpetuating the illusion of possessing mysterious abilities, the appearance of a trance state is often interpreted as an \\"effect\\" of the hypnotist's \\"power\\". The real power of stage hypnosis comes from the trust the \\"hypnotist\\" can instill in their subjects. Subjects have to cooperate and be willing to follow instructions and the hypnotist will employ several tests to choose the best subjects. Some people are very trusting, or even looking for an excuse to abdicate their responsibilities and are apparently able to be \\"hypnotised\\" within seconds, while others take more time to counter their fears. Suggestion is very powerful and a good hypnotist will know how to deliver suggestions that can create better entertainment for the audience. In his book Deeper and Deeper by Jonathan Chase,Chase, Jonathan (2005) Deeper and Deeper the secrets of stage hypnosis - p. 101 he talks about delivering suggestion, more importantly, The Super Suggestion a phrase he coined in his first published book in 1999: > \\"From this moment everything I say to you. Every single thing I say, no > matter how silly or stupid it seems will instantly become your reality. > Everything I say will instantly become your reality.\\" He emphasises the use of repetition but warns that when they have accepted the suggestion then everything that the hypnotist says to them after this point will become an irresistible suggestion. Historically, stage hypnotists often made claims for hypnotically induced enhancements to volunteer abilities beyond normal limits. One instance is \\"The Human Bridge,\\" in which a hypnotised subject is supposedly put in a state of catalepsy and placed as a \\"bridge\\" between two chairs. The stunt looks impressive: however, as hypnotist Andrew Newton puts it: \\"Any reasonably strong adult can do this stunt without being hypnotised at all.\\"https://www.newtonhypnosis.com/a-bridge-too-far/ Subjects In a stage hypnosis situation the \\"hypnotist\\" chooses their participants carefully. First they give the entire audience a few exercises to perform and plant ideas in their minds, such as: * only intelligent people can be hypnotized * only those who are open-minded to being hypnotized and willing to participate. It has been alleged that these suggestions are designed to overcome the natural fear of trusting a stranger with the greater fear of becoming an object of ridicule as one who is unintelligent, unsociable, and joyless. Out of the crowd the hypnotist will spot people who appear trusting, extroverted and willing to put on a show. The hypnotist starts them off by having them imagine ordinary situations that they have likely encountered, like being cold or hot, hungry or thirsty then gradually builds to giving them a suggestion to do something that is totally out of character, such as tap dancing, singing like Elvis, clucking like a chicken or forgetting a number. The desire to be the center of attention, having an excuse to violate their own inner fear suppressors and the pressure to please, plus the expectation of the audience wanting them to provide some entertainment is usually enough to persuade an extrovert to do almost anything. In other words, the participants are persuaded to 'play along'. Yet, whilst this accounts for some situations, it does not accord with those where hecklers, uncooperative audiences and those who wish to \\"disprove\\" the hypnotist create a set of negative expectations, uncooperative atmosphere and opposition which the performer must use skill to overcome.  Law  In some countries, there are laws and guidelines regarding stage hypnosis. In the UK, the Hypnotism Act 1952 governs the use of hypnosis in public. The original Act was amended in 1976 and again in 2003. In 1996 the government released \\"model conditions\\" which were refined and revised after consultation with FESH and with medical and academic psychologists. Note that these have no legal force: they are suggested conditions which local authorities may or may not feel appropriate to impose or modify when regulating hypnosis. If stage hypnosis is performed at a public venue a permit (permission) must be acquired from the local authority and the local authority is advised to monitor the performance to ensure that all guidelines are followed. It is illegal to hold any form of stage hypnosis in a public venue (amongst other venues) unless the local authority has issued their consent for this. In the accompanying circular announcing the revised model conditions in 1996Dipple, D. 1996. UK Home Office circular No39/1996 it was conceded that, as asserted by skeptical stage hypnotist Alex Tsander during the consultation process: \\"In practice volunteers do not react as if they truly believe that there is, for example, a giant spider behind them or a bomb under their chair.\\"Dipple, 1996, p. 6, sub-section \\"Previous Section 3(I)(Vi). This was a critical point of distinction and represents a formal recognition of the \\"as if\\" nature of behaviour in stage hypnotism in contradistinction to claims for its supposed subjective reality. In the past, stage hypnosis has been banned in several countries in the world including Denmark and some states in the USA. Most of these countries have revoked these laws or don't enforce them. In Israel, it remains illegal to perform any kind of hypnosis without a license given to doctors, dentists and psychologists. In Belgium, stage hypnosis has been forbidden since 1892;Loi sur l'hypnotisme, 30 mai 1892, article 1. the law was mentioned in 2017 to force the cancellation of a spectacle by Messmer.Agence Belga, Le spectacle de Messmer annul√© √† Colfontaine car l‚Äôhypnose en spectacle est ill√©gal selon la loi, La Libre Belgique (14 novembre 2017) References Further reading * Braid, J., Neurypnology or the Rationale of Nervous Sleep Considered in Relation with Animal Magnetism Illustrated by Numerous Cases of its Successful Application in the Relief and Cure of Disease, John Churchill, (London), 1843. ** N.B.

Accessed September 2020. Some have identified him with a certain Daniel, bishop of Suriev between 1115 and 1122. Travels thumb Origin Archimandrite Daniel journeyed to the West from the Rus monastery where he lived as an igumen. This monastery was probably near Chernihiv in Ukraine, in the Land of Chernihivshchyna. Constantinople, Greece, Cyprus Daniel's journeys took him to Constantinople, then by way of Cyprus to the Holy Land. Daniel's narratives begin at Constantinople. He began his travels in the early 12th century and was likely in Constantinople around 1106 to 1108.Merriam-Webster, p. 298Anzovin, p. 201, item 3391 Holy Land Daniel stayed in the Jerusalem area for over a year and took various trips around Palestine and Syria. During this time he explored the Dead Sea, Hebron, and Damascus. He learned much of the regions from his three major excursions to the Dead Sea and Lower Jordan (which he compares to the Snov River), Bethlehem and Hebron, and Damascus. Daniel wrote his journeys in narratives he titled Puteshestive igumena Daniila ‚Äî Life and Pilgrimage of Daniel, Hegumen from the Land of the Rus. Daniel's description of the Holy Land preserves a record of conditions that are peculiarly characteristic of the time. He describes the Saracen raiding almost up to the walls of Christian Jerusalem and the friendly relations between Roman and Eastern churches in Syria. Daniel visited Palestine in the reign of Baldwin I of Jerusalem and apparently soon after the crusader capture of Acre in 1104. He claims to have accompanied Baldwin on an expedition against Damascus (c. 1107). Daniel's narratives show that Baldwin treated him with much friendliness. Daniel records that several of his friends from Kiev and Old Novgorod were present with him at the Easter Eve \\"miracle\\" in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Significance 12th- century Holy Land Daniel's account of Jerusalem is descriptive and accurate. His observant and detailed record of Palestine is one of the most valuable medieval documents that exist. Daniel had some knowledge of both Greek and Latin and so was able to use interpreters. He writes, It is impossible to come to know all the holy places without guides and interpreters. He writes of a holy man of great learning, well advanced in years, who had lived in the Galilee for thirty years and had accompanied him in Palestine, however he made some major mistakes in topography and history.. Daniel visited about sixty places in the area. Travel literature While Daniel was not the first traveller to leave the Rus, his travels were the first which there are written records of. There were warriors, merchants, and earlier pilgrims who had travelled from the Kievan Rus to the outside world before the twelfth century; however, none left written records that have come down to the present day. Daniel was one of the first European travellers to travel long distances on foot and keep a written account of his travels - a travelog. Church history Daniel's narratives are also important in the history of the Old East Slavic language and in the study of ritual and liturgy of the time (i.e. description of the Easter services in Jerusalem and the Descent of the Holy Fire). Manuscripts There are seventy-six manuscripts of Daniel's narratives of which only five are before the year 1500. The oldest of his narratives is dated 1475 of which three editions still exist in Saint Petersburg at the Library of Ecclesiastical History.

The process of identity correlation validates that individuals only have account login IDs for the appropriate systems and applications a user should have access to according to the organization's business policies, access control policies and various application requirements. A unique identifier, in the context of identity correlation, is any identifier which is guaranteed to be unique among all identifiers used for a group of individuals and for a specific purpose. There are three main types of unique identifiers, each corresponding to a different generation strategy: * Serial numbers, assigned incrementally * Random numbers, selected from a number space much larger than the maximum (or expected) number of objects to be identified. Although not really unique, some identifiers of this type may be appropriate for identifying objects in many practical applications, and so are referred to as ‚Äúunique‚Äù within this context * Name or codes allocated by choice, but are forced to be unique by keeping a central registry such as the EPC Information Services of the EPCglobal Network For the purposes of identity correlation, a unique identifier is typically a serial number or random number selected from a number space much larger than the maximum number of individuals who will be identified. A unique identifier, in this context, is typically represented as an additional attribute in the directory associated with each particular data source. However, adding an attribute to each system-specific directory may affect application requirements or specific business requirements, depending on the requirements of the organization. Under these circumstances, unique identifiers may not be an acceptable addition to an organization.  Basic Requirements of Identity Correlation  Identity Correlation involves several factors: 1\\\\. Linking Disparate Account IDs Across Multiple Systems or Applications Many organizations must find a method to comply with audits that require it to link disparate application user identities with the actual people who are associated with those user identities. Some individuals may have a fairly common first and/or last name, which makes it difficult to link the right individual to the appropriate account login ID, especially when those account login IDs are not linked to enough specific identity data to remain unique. A typical construct of the login ID, for example, can be the 1st character of givenname + next 7 of sn, with incremental uniqueness. This would produce login IDs like jsmith12, jsmith 13, jsmith14, etc. for users John Smith, James Smith and Jack Smith, respectively. Conversely, one individual might undergo a name change either formally or informally, which can cause new account login IDs that the individual appropriates to appear drastically different in nomenclature to the account login IDs that individual acquired prior to any change. For example, a woman could get married and decide to use her new surname professionally. If her name was originally Mary Jones but she is now Mary Smith, she could call HR and ask them to update her contact information and email address with her new surname. This request would update her Microsoft Exchange login ID to mary.smith to reflect that surname change, but it might not actually update her information or login credentials in any other system she has access to. In this example, she could still be mjones in Active Directory and mj5678 in RACF. Identity correlation should link the appropriate system account login IDs to individuals who might be indistinguishable, as well as to those individuals who might appear to be drastically different from a system-by-system standpoint, but should be associated with the same individual. For more details on this topic, please see: The Second Wave: Linking Identities to Contexts 2\\\\. Discovering Intentional and Unintentional Inconsistencies in Identity Data Inconsistencies in identity data typically develop over time in organizations as applications are added, removed or changed and as individuals attain or retain an ever- changing stream of access rights as they matriculate into and out of the organization. Application user login IDs do not always have a consistent syntax across different applications or systems and many user login IDs are not specific enough to directly correlate it back to one particular individual within an organization. User data inconsistencies can also occur due to simple manual input errors, non-standard nomenclature, or name changes that might not be identically updated across all systems. The identity correlation process should take these inconsistencies into account to link up identity data that might seem to be unrelated upon initial investigation. 3\\\\. Identifying Orphan or Defunct Account Login IDs Organizations can expand and consolidate from mergers and acquisitions, which increases the complexity of business processes, policies and procedures as a result. As an outcome of these events, users are subject to moving to different parts of the organization, attaining a new position within the organization, or matriculating out of the organization altogether. At the same time, each new application that is added has the potential to produce a new completely unique user ID. Some identities may become redundant, others may be in violation of application-specific or more widespread departmental policies, others could be related to non-human or system account IDs, and still others may simply no longer be applicable for a particular user environment. Projects that span different parts of the organization or focus on more than one application become difficult to implement because user identities are often not properly organized or recognized as being defunct due to changes in the business process. An identity correlation process must identify all orphan or defunct account identities that no longer belong from such drastic shifts in an organization's infrastructure. 4\\\\. Validating Individuals to their Appropriate Account IDs Under such regulations as Sarbanes-Oxley and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, it is required for organizations to ensure the integrity of each user across all systems and account for all access a user has to various back-end systems and applications in an organization. If implemented correctly, identity correlation will expose compliance issues. Auditors frequently ask organizations to account for who has access to what resources. For companies that have not already fully implemented an enterprise identity management solution, identity correlation and validation is required to adequately attest to the true state of an organization's user base. This validation process typically requires interaction with individuals within an organization who are familiar with the organization's user base from an enterprise-wide perspective, as well as those individuals who are responsible and knowledgeable of each individual system and/or application-specific user base. In addition, much of the validation process might ultimately involve direct communication with the individual in question to confirm particular identity data that is associated with that specific individual. 5\\\\. Assigning a unique primary or common key for every system or application Account ID that is attached to each individual In response to various compliance pressures, organizations have an option to introduce unique identifiers for its entire user base to validate that each user belongs in each specific system or application in which he/she has login capabilities. In order to effectuate such a policy, various individuals familiar with the organization's entire user base, as well as each system-specific user-base, must be responsible for validating that certain identities should be linked together and other identities should be disassociated from each other. Once the validation process is complete, a unique identifier can be assigned to that individual and his or her associated system-specific account login IDs.  Approaches to Linking Disparate Account IDs  As mentioned above, in many organizations, users may sign into different systems and applications using different login IDs. There are many reasons to link these into \`\`enterprise-wide user profiles. There are a number of basic strategies to perform this correlation, or \\"ID Mapping:\\" * Assume that account IDs are the same: ** In this case, mapping is trivial. ** This actually works in many organizations, in cases where a rigorous and standardized process has been used to assign IDs to new users for a long time. * Import mapping data from an existing system: ** If an organization has implemented a robust process for mapping IDs to users over a long period, this data is already available and can be imported into any new Identity management system. * Exact matching on attribute values: ** Find one identity attribute or a combination of attributes on one system which correlate to one or more attributes on another system. ** Connect IDs on the two systems by finding users whose attribute(s) are the same. * Approximate matching on attribute values: ** The same as above, but instead of requiring attributes or expressions to match exactly, tolerate some differences. ** This allows for misspelled, inconsistently capitalized and otherwise somewhat diverse names and similar identity values. ** The risk here is that accounts which should not be connected will accidentally be matched by this process. * Self-service login ID reconciliation: ** Invite users to fill in a form and indicate which IDs, on which systems, they own. ** Users might lie or make mistakes‚Äîso it's important to validate user input, for example by asking users to also provide passwords and to check those passwords. ** Users might not recognize system names‚Äîso it's important to offer alternatives or ask users for IDs+passwords in general, rather than asking them to specify which system those IDs are for. * Hire a consultant and/or do it manually: ** This still leaves open the question of where the data comes from‚Äîperhaps by interviewing every user in question?  Common Barriers to Performing Identity Correlation  1\\\\. Privacy Concerns Often, any process that requires an in-depth look into identity data brings up a concern for privacy and disclosure issues. Part of the identity correlation process infers that each particular data source will need to be compared against an authoritative data source to ensure consistency and validity against relevant corporate policies and access controls. Any such comparison that involves an exposure of enterprise-wide, authoritative, HR- related identity data will require various non-disclosure agreements either internally or externally, depending on how an organization decides to undergo an identity correlation exercise. Because authoritative data is frequently highly confidential and restricted, such concerns may bar the way from performing an identity correlation activity thoroughly and sufficiently. 2\\\\. Extensive Time and Effort Requirements Most organizations experience difficulties understanding the inconsistencies and complexities that lie within their identity data across all of their data sources. Typically, the process can not be completed accurately or sufficiently by undergoing a manual comparison of two lists of identity data or even executing simple scripts to find matches between two different data sets. Even if an organization can dedicate full-time individuals to such an effort, the methodologies themselves usually do not expose an adequate enough percentage of defunct identities, validate an adequate enough percentage of matched identities, or identify system (non-person) account IDs to pass the typical requirements of an identity-related audit. See also *Sarbanes-Oxley Act(SOX) *Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act (GLBA) *Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act(HIPAA) *Information Technology Audit (ITA) Manual efforts to accomplish identity correlation require a great deal of time and people effort, and do not guarantee that the effort will be completed successfully or in a compliant fashion. Because of this, automated identity correlation solutions have recently entered the marketplace to provide more effortless ways of handling identity correlation exercises. Typical automated identity correlation solution functionality includes the following characteristics: * Analysis and comparison of identities within multiple data sources * Flexible match criteria definitions and assignments for any combination of data elements between any two data sources * Easy connectivity either directly or indirectly to all permissible sources of data * Out-of-the-box reports and/or summaries of data match results * Ability to manually override matched or unmatched data combinations * Ability to view data results on fine-grained level * Assignment of unique identifiers to pre-approved or manually validated matched data. * Export abilities to send verified user lists back to source systems and/or provisioning solutions * Ability to customize data mapping techniques to refine data matches * Role-based access controls built into the solution to regulate identity data exposures as data is loaded, analyzed, and validated by various individuals both inside and outside of the organization * Ability to validate identity data against end-users more quickly or efficiently than through manual methodologies *Collection of identity attributes from personal mobile devices through partial identity extraction *Profiling of web surfing and social media behavior through tracking mechanisms, U.S. Patent *Biometric measurements of the users in question can correlate identities across systems *Centralized identity brokerage systems that administer and access identity attributes across identity silos  Three Methods of Identity Correlation Project Delivery  Identity correlation solutions can be implemented under three distinct delivery models. These delivery methodologies are designed to offer a solution that is flexible enough to correspond to various budget and staffing requirements, as well as meet both short and/or long-term project goals and initiatives. Software Purchase ‚Äì This is the classic Software Purchase model where an organization purchases a software license and runs the software within its own hardware infrastructure. * Training is available and recommended * Installation Services are optional Identity Correlation as a Service (ICAS) ‚Äì ICAS is a subscription-based service where a client connects to a secure infrastructure to load and run correlation activities. This offering provides full functionality offered by the identity correlation solution without owning and maintaining hardware and related support staff. Turn-Key Identity Correlation ‚Äì A Turn-key methodology requires a client to contract with and provide data to a solutions vendor to perform the required identity correlation activities. Once completed, the solutions vendor will return correlated data, identify mismatches, and provide data integrity reports. Validation activities will still require some direct feedback from individuals within the organization who understand the state of the organizational user base from an enterprise-wide viewpoint, as well as those individuals within the organization who are familiar with each system-specific user base. In addition, some validation activities might require direct feedback from individuals within the user base itself. A Turn-Key solution can be performed as a single one-time activity or monthly, quarterly, or even as part of an organization's annual validation activities.

The first invasion's intention was to secure the flank of the main Mongolian army attacking the Kingdom of Hungary. The Mongols neutralized any potential help to King B√©la IV being provided by the Poles or any military orders. Background The Mongols invaded Europe with three armies. One of the three armies was tasked with distracting Poland, before joining the main Mongol force invading Hungary. The Mongol general in charge, Subutai, did not want the Polish forces to be able to threaten his flank during the primary invasion of Hungary. Thus, the Mongol goal was to use a small detachment to prevent the Poles from assisting Hungary until the Hungarians were defeated. That army, under Baidar, Kadan and Orda Khan, began scouting operations in late 1240. Though the Mongols may have entered with relatively modest goals and forces, they almost completely annihilated all Polish forces and influenced the Bohemian army to defend its homeland instead of assisting the beleaguered Hungary. Invasion Tactics Battle of Legnica, 1241. From a medieval illuminated manuscript A key feature of the invasion was the speed and uncertainty of the Mongol advances. Though the full Polish forces were far larger than the meager two Mongol tumens (12-20,000 men)Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War (2016). assigned to defeat them, the Mongols attacked from multiple axes before the Polish armies could merge into one united force. As a result, the Mongols defeated multiple piecemeal Polish armies in various battles and skirmishes who lacked the time to properly organize. Route Mongol tumen, moving from recently conquered Volodymyr-Volynskyi in Kievan Rus, first destroyed Sutiejsk, then sacked Lublin, after which Sandomierz was besieged and then sacked after surrendering on February 13th. Around this time, their forces split. Orda's forces devastated central Poland, moving to Wolb√≥rz and as far north as ≈Åƒôczyca, before turning south and heading via Sieradz towards Wroc≈Çaw. Baidar and Kadan ravaged the southern part of Poland, moving to Chmielnik, Krak√≥w, Opole and finally, Legnica, before leaving Polish lands heading west and south. Baidar and Kadan on 13 February defeated a Polish army under the voivode of Krak√≥w, W≈Çodzimierz, in the battle of Tursko. On 18 March they defeated another Polish army with units from Krak√≥w and Sandomierz at the battle of Chmielnik. Panic spread through the Polish lands, and the citizens abandoned Krak√≥w, which was seized and burned by the Mongols by 24 March. In the meantime, one of the most powerful contemporary Dukes of Poland, and Duke of Silesia, Henry II the Pious, gathered his forces and allies around Legnica (). Henry, in order to gather more forces, even sacrificed one of the largest towns of Silesia, Wroc≈Çaw (Breslau), abandoning it to the Mongols. Henry was also waiting for Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, his brother-in-law, who was coming to his aid with a large army. Battle of Legnica While considering whether to besiege Wroc≈Çaw, Baidar and Kadan received reports that the Bohemians were days away with a large army. The Mongols turned from Wroc≈Çaw, not finishing the siege, in order to intercept Henry's forces before the European armies could meet. The Mongols caught up with Henry near Legnica at place known later as Wahlstatt (\\"Battlefield\\" in Middle High German; now village Legnickie Pole, \\"Field of Legnica\\"). Henry, in addition to his own forces, was aided by Mieszko II the Fat (Mieszko II Oty≈Çy), as well as remnants of Polish armies defeated at Tursk and Chmielnik, members of military orders and small numbers of foreign volunteers. The decisive battle for Poland occurred at battle of Legnica on 9 April. A European knight charge appeared to cause that section of the Mongol line to rout, thus leading Henry II to commit his cavalry to chase them. However, the Mongols merely had lured the knights away from their supporting infantry, and used a smokescreen to prevent the infantry and remaining cavalry from seeing their more advanced knights being surrounded and massacred. Once the Polish & German knights were killed, the remainder of the Polish army was vulnerable and easily encircled. The later Polish chronicler Jan D≈Çugosz claimed that the Mongols caused confusion in the Polish forces by yelling 'Flee!' in Polish through the smokescreen. The Mongols did not take Legnica castle, but had a free rein to pillage and plunder Silesia, before moving off to join their main forces in Hungary. Legend A contingent of Teutonic Knights of indeterminate number is traditionally believed to have joined the allied army. However, recent analysis of the 15th-century Annals of Jan D≈Çugosz by Labuda suggests that the German crusaders may have been added to the text after chronicler D≈Çugosz had completed the work. A legend that the Prussian Landmeister of the Teutonic Knights, Poppo von Osterna, was killed during the battle is false, as he died at Legnica years later while visiting his wife's nunnery.William Urban. The Teutonic Knights: A Military History. Greenhill Books. London. 2003. The Hospitallers have also been said to have participated in this battle, but this too seems to be a fabrication added in later accounts; neither Jan D≈Çugosz's accounts nor the letter sent to the King of France (then Saint Louis) from the Templar Grand Master Ponce d'Aubon mention them.Burzy≈Ñski, p.22 Peter Jackson further points out that the only military order that fought at Legnica was the Templars.Jackson, p. 205 The Templar contribution was very small, estimated around 68‚Äì88 well-trained, well-armed soldiers;Burzy≈Ñski, p. 24 their letter to the king of France gives their losses as nine brother knights, three sergeants and 500 'men'‚Äîaccording to their use of the term, probably peasants working their estates and thus neither better armed or trained than the rest of the army's infantry. Aftermath The Mongols avoided the Bohemian forces, who were too frightened to advance forward and assist the Hungarians, and defeated the Hungarians in the Battle of Mohi. But news that the Grand Khan √ñgedei had died the previous year along with disagreements between the Mongol princes Batu, Guyuk, and Buri caused the descendants of the Grand Khan to return to the Mongol capital of Karakorum for the kurultai which would elect the next Khagan, and probably saved the Polish lands from being completely overrun by the Mongols. The death of Duke Henry, who was close to unifying the Polish lands and reversing their fragmentation, set back the unification of Poland, until it took place in the 14th century, and also meant the loss of Silesia, which would drift outside the Polish sphere of influence (and gradually became a part of the Bohemian Crown). A number of military settlements such as Sutiejsk were never rebuilt after having been destroyed by the Mongols. This ancient Slavic gord was one of the most important administrative centers of the so-called Land of the Red Gords (‚ÄúGrody Czerwienskie‚Äù), a historic region between Poland and Rus‚Äô. Likely founded by Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise, this Polish village has a population of 500 today. Later Mongol invasions There were also later, larger Mongol invasions of Poland (1259‚Äì1260 and 1287‚Äì1288). In 1254 or 1255, Daniel of Galicia revolted against the Mongol rule. He repelled the initial Mongol assault under Orda's son Quremsa. In 1259, the Mongols returned under the new command of Burundai (Mongolian: Borolday). According to some sources, Daniel fled to Poland leaving his son and brother at the mercy of the Mongol army. He may have hidden in the castle of Galicia instead. The Mongols needed to secure Poland's aid to Daniel and war booty to feed the demand of their soldiers. Lithuanians also attacked Smolensk and menaced Torzhok, tributaries of the Golden Horde, in c. 1258. The Mongols sent a punitive expedition into Lithuania for this. The Lithuanians appear to have not resisted them efficiently. Borolday again demanded Daniel to recruit more troops. After demolishing walls of all towns in Galicia and Volhyinia, in 1259, 18 years after the first attack to Poland, two tumens (20,000 men) from the Golden Horde, under the leadership of Berke, attacked Poland after raiding Lithuania. This attack was commanded by the young prince Nogai Khan and general Burundai. The Rus' soldiers under Daniel's son, Lev, and brother, Vasily, joined the Mongol expedition. Lublin, Sandomierz, Zawichost, and Krak√≥w were ravaged and plundered by the Mongol army. Berke had no intention of occupying or conquering Poland. After this raid Pope Alexander IV tried without success to organize a crusade against the Tatars. North-western Rus princes complained of the repeated attacks of the Kingdom of Poland to their Mongol masters. Nogai's army recruited troops from Rus principalities and it included Vlakh, Kipchak, and Alan soldiers. An unsuccessful raid followed in 1287, led by Talabuga and Nogai Khan. Lublin, Masovia, Sandomierz and Sieradz were successfully raided, but they were defeated at Krak√≥w. Despite this, Krak√≥w was devastated. This raid consisted of less than one tumen, since the Golden Horde's armies were tied down in a new conflict which the Il-Khanate had initiated in 1284. The force retreated instead of facing the larger Polish force. Ozbek Khan and Jani Beg warred with the powerful kingdom of Poland to secure their claim on western Rus (modern Belarus and Ukraine). Towards 1356, Casimir III the Great reached an agreement with the Golden Horde and apparently undertook to pay tribute in exchange for military support against Lithuania. In a letter to the Teutonic master, he claimed that seven Mongol princes commanding troops were coming to his aid. The Knights, however, were seeking a rapprochement with Lithuania and accused Casimir to the popes as having submitted to the Mongols.

An interaction technique, user interface technique or input technique is a combination of hardware and software elements that provides a way for computer users to accomplish a single task. For example, one can go back to the previously visited page on a Web browser by either clicking a button, pressing a key, performing a mouse gesture or uttering a speech command. It is a widely used term in human-computer interaction. In particular, the term \\"new interaction technique\\" is frequently used to introduce a novel user interface design idea.  Definition  Although there is no general agreement on the exact meaning of the term \\"interaction technique\\", the most popular definition is from the computer graphics literature: A more recent variation is:  The computing view  From the computer's perspective, an interaction technique involves: * One or several input devices that capture user input, * One or several output devices that display user feedback, * A piece of software that: ** interprets user input into commands the computer can understand, ** produces user feedback based on user input and the system's state. Consider for example the process of deleting a file using a contextual menu. This assumes the existence of a mouse (input device), a screen (output device), and a piece of code that paints a menu and updates its selection (user feedback) and sends a command to the file system when the user clicks on the \\"delete\\" item (interpretation). User feedback can be further used to confirm that the command has been invoked.  The user's view  From the user's perspective, an interaction technique is a way to perform a single computing task and can be informally expressed with user instructions or usage scenarios. For example, \\"to delete a file, right- click on the file you want to delete, then click on the delete item\\".  The designer's view  From the user interface designer's perspective, an interaction technique is a well-defined solution to a specific user interface design problem. Interaction techniques as conceptual ideas can be refined, extended, modified and combined. For example, contextual menus are a solution to the problem of rapidly selecting commands. Pie menus are a radial variant of contextual menus. Marking menus combine pie menus with gesture recognition.  Level of granularity  One extant cause of confusion in the general discussion of interaction is a lack of clarity about levels of granularity.Sedig, K., Parsons, P., Dittmer, M., & Haworth, R. (2013). Human‚Äìcentered interactivity of visualization tools: Micro‚Äì and macro‚Äìlevel considerations. In W. Huang (Ed.), Handbook of Human-Centric Visualization (pp. 717‚Äì743). Springer, New York. Interaction techniques are usually characterized at a low level of granularity‚Äînot necessarily at the lowest level of physical events, but at a level that is technology-, platform-, and/or implementation-dependent. For example, interaction techniques exist that are specific to mobile devices, touch-based displays, traditional mouse/keyboard inputs, and other paradigms‚Äîin other words, they are dependent on a specific technology or platform. In contrast, viewed at higher levels of granularity, interaction is not tied to any specific technology or platform. The interaction of 'filtering', for example, can be characterized in a way that is technology-independent‚Äîe.g., performing an action such that some information is hidden and only a subset of the original information remains. Such an interaction could be implemented using any number of techniques, and on any number of platforms and technologies. See also the discussion of #interaction patterns below.  Interaction tasks and domain objects  An interaction task is \\"the unit of an entry of information by the user\\", such as entering a piece of text, issuing a command, or specifying a 2D position. A similar concept is that of domain object, which is a piece of application data that can be manipulated by the user.M. Beaudouin-Lafon (2000) Instrumental interaction: an interaction model for designing post-WIMP user interfaces. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. Interaction techniques are the glue between physical I/O devices and interaction tasks or domain objects.P. Dragicevic and J-D Fekete (2004) The Input Configurator toolkit: towards high input adaptability in interactive applications. In Proceedings of the Working Conference on Advanced Visual interfaces. Different types of interaction techniques can be used to map a specific device to a specific domain object. For example, different gesture alphabets exist for pen-based text input. In general, the less compatible the device is with the domain object, the more complex the interaction technique.W. Buxton (1986) There's More to Interaction than Meets the Eye: Some Issues in Manual Input. In Norman, D. A. and Draper, S. W. (Eds.), User Centered System Design: New Perspectives on Human‚ÄìComputer Interaction. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale, New Jersey, 319‚Äì337. For example, using a mouse to specify a 2D point involves a trivial interaction technique, whereas using a mouse to rotate a 3D object requires more creativity to design the technique and more lines of code to implement it. A current trend is to avoid complex interaction techniques by matching physical devices with the task as close as possible, such as exemplified by the field of tangible computing. But this is not always a feasible solution. Furthermore, device/task incompatibilities are unavoidable in computer accessibility, where a single switch can be used to control the whole computer environment.  Interaction style  Interaction techniques that share the same metaphor or design principles can be seen as belonging to the same interaction style. General examples are command line and direct manipulation user interfaces.  Interaction patterns  While interaction techniques are typically technology-, platform-, and/or implementation-dependent (see #level of granularity above), human-computer or human-information interactions can be characterized at higher levels of abstraction that are independent of particular technologies and platforms. At such levels of abstraction, the concern is not precisely how an interaction is performed; rather, the concern is a conceptual characterization of what the interaction is, and what the general utility of the interaction is for the user(s). Thus, any single interaction pattern may be instantiated by any number of interaction techniques, on any number of different technologies and platforms. Interaction patterns are more concerned with the timeless, invariant qualities of an interaction.Sedig, K. & Parsons, P. (2013). Interaction design for complex cognitive activities with visual representations: A pattern-based approach. AIS Transactions on Human-Computer Interaction, 5(2), 84‚Äì133.  Visualization technique  Interaction techniques essentially involve data entry and manipulation, and thus place greater emphasis on input than output. Output is merely used to convey affordances and provide user feedback. The use of the term input technique further reinforces the central role of input. Conversely, techniques that mainly involve data exploration and thus place greater emphasis on output are called visualization techniques. They are studied in the field of information visualization.  Research and innovation  A large part of research in human-computer interaction involves exploring easier-to- learn or more efficient interaction techniques for common computing tasks. This includes inventing new (post-WIMP) interaction techniques, possibly relying on methods from user interface design, and assessing their efficiency with respect to existing techniques using methods from experimental psychology. Examples of scientific venues in these topics are the UIST and the CHI conferences. Other research focuses on the specification of interaction techniques, sometimes using formalisms such as Petri nets for the purposes of formal verification.Schyn, A., Navarre, D., Palanque, P., and Porcher Nedel, L. 2003.

He also served as the vice- chairman of the BAC-Sud Aviation Concorde Committee that produced the Concorde, working alongside Morien Morgan. His designs include the Blenheim, Britannia, Type 188 and many others. He was known throughout his career as a perfectionist, as well as his criticism for those who did not measure up ‚Äì criticisms that included ministers, civil servants, the Brabazon Committee and BOAC.Peter Masefield, \\"Obituary: Sir Archibald Russell\\", The Independent, 1 July 1995.  Early life and career  Archibald Russell was born in Cinderford, Gloucestershire. He was raised in the Forest of Dean and attended East Dean Grammar School where his father (known as \\"the mathemagician\\" owing to his facility in complex mental calculation) was headmaster. When he was fifteen the family moved to Bristol and his education continued at Fairfield Grammar School, and then the Engineering faculty of Bristol University where he gained a BSc in automotive engineering. His first job was maintaining buses for the Bristol Tramways & Carriage Company, one of Sir George White's companies.John Coneybeare, \\"Sir Archibald Russell (1904‚Äì1995): Aircraft Engineer\\" , Retired Professional Engineers' Club (Bristol), August 2005  Bristol Aeroplane Company Another of George White's companies was the Bristol Aeroplane Company. Russell joined the company in May 1925, at age 21, as an assistant in the stress office. He met Miss Lorna Mansfield, a secretary at the company, and they were married for over 50 years. One of his first efforts at the company were stress calculations for the Type 99 Badminton, a biplane racer being built for the 1926 King's Cup. The Badminton crashed a month before the race, which gravely concerned Russell until the reason was revealed to be a seized engine. Another early design was the Type 95 Bagshot, a twin-engine monoplane fighter. Russell was invited to take a flight in the Bagshot, and was alarmed to see the wings twisting during control use, a problem that led to the abandoning of the design. He developed a new method of separately calculating bending and torsional stresses, which later led to a new single-spar monoplane wing design that was granted a patent. Over a short period of time, Chief Designer Frank Barnwell drew Russell closer into the primary design team. He worked on the Type 105 Bulldog, which went on to see production of more than 500 examples. This was followed by another monoplane fighter, the Type 133, but the contract was won by the Gloster Gladiator instead. In 1935 the first of the RAF Expansion Schemes was launched, and Bristol won two contracts for monoplanes, the Bombay troop-carrier and the Blenheim bomber. Barnwell and his two chief assistants, Leslie Frise and Russell, looked to address the Bagshot's wing problems in the Bombay, and over-designed it to ensure flexing would not be an issue. The design suffered as a result, both overweight and extremely difficult to manufacture. Only 50 were built and saw limited service. The Blenheim was based on newer designs and was originally built for speed, not utility. It was the result of contest to produce the fastest four-passenger plane in Europe, and therefore did not require the higher weights and ruggedness of the Bombay. It had a much simpler design, but proved just as capable, and was easily adapted into a light bomber. The Blenheim was far more successful than Bombay, with over 1,000 delivered by the start of the Second World War in September 1939. In August 1938 Barnwell had been killed flying a small aeroplane of his own design. Leslie Frise took over the Chief Designer role, with Russell becoming deputy. They were immediately put to work on a variety of development of the Blenheim, including the Type 152 Beaufort and Type 156 Beaufighter. More than 5,500 Beaufighter's were built before the war ended. A final development, the Type 164 \\"Brigand\\", was produced only in small numbers before being replaced by the English Electric Canberra. In 1941 the Air Staff placed a development contract for a long-range, 100 ton, 300 mph heavy bomber with a bomb load of 80,000 lbs. The aircraft was designed to fill Barnes Wallis' concept of the \\"Victory Bomber\\", which would drop huge \\"earth quake bombs\\" that would destroy dams and other power plants even with a near miss, and thereby render Germany unable to run its industry. Frise and Russell started work on such a design, featuring extensive streamlining for lower drag and better range, powered by eight Centaurus engines, paired to drive four propellers. But before the design had got very far, Wallis had moved onto the idea of a smaller special-purpose bomb that could fill the same role, but would be much smaller. This developed into the famed bouncing bomb carried by the Avro Lancaster. Chief Designer In February 1944 this work was able to be re-used when the Brabazon Committee ordered a very large transatlantic airliner to carry 90 passengers for 5,000 miles in 17 hours, all with sleeping accommodation. Frise and Russell had just started work on this adaptation when Frise quit to become Technical Director of Hunting Aircraft. Russell was promoted to Chief Designer in his place. The new design emerged as the Brabazon, but proved to be a commercial failure. Overly large and too slow, it was entering the market just as turboprop and jet engines were coming into the field. BOAC asked for the second prototype to be powered by four Proteus turboprops in place of the eight Centaurus', but this engine would need additional development before it could be fitted and BOAC lost interest in the meantime. The prototype was later cut up after suffering from fatigue cracks in the engine/propeller mounting structures. While the Brabazon was turning from design to prototype, the company directors asked Russell to start development of a much more modest freighter design. This emerged as the Bristol Freighter in 1945. A small number were sold to a variety of users, and the design was a modest success. In 1947 Bristol won a design competition for \\"An airliner to required to carry thirty six passengers on routes to South Africa, Australia and the Far East.\\" The number of passengers, 36, had been set by the capacity of the standard BOAC airport bus. Russell redesigned the plane for 68 passengers instead, producing the Britannia. As development continued, BOAC decided the Proteus was ready for airline use, and asked for development to be switched to this engine. With some additional wing area, this allowed the passenger capacity to be increased to 96 without altering the fuselage. The first prototype flew in August 1952, but the engines were still not ready for production. The second prototype, with upgraded Proteus III's, flew in December 1953. This example caught fire in February 1954 and had to be ditched. The cause was eventually traced to a failure in the propeller reduction gearing, but did not significantly set back development. However, at this point the de Havilland Comet suffered a series of mysterious crashes, and the ensuing investigation discovered extensive metal fatigue problems. This led to a new requirement that all designs had to undergo extensive water tank testing. After passing these tests, the Proteus engines proved to have icing problems, leading to additional redesigns. By the time the Britannia finally entered service in 1957, the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 were about to enter service, dramatically limiting interest in the Britannia. In the late 1950s Russell led the design of the Bristol Type 200, a concept that competed with the Hawker Siddeley Trident. Russell felt that British European Airways' (BEA) specification was too small, so the Type 200 was closer in size and range to the Boeing 727, which later sold almost 10 times as well as the Trident. In 1958 BEA selected the Trident and the Type 200 was cancelled. Concorde Through the 1950s Russell became increasingly interested in supersonic flight, and was particularly interested in the \\"breathtaking novelty\\" of the slender delta wing, which gave good lift at high angle of attack due to the phenomenon of vortex lift. Russell and his team proposed a number of designs using the new wing, eventually leading a number of paper studies for a supersonic transport, starting with the Type 198 in 1961. The team, led by Bill Strang, Mick Wilde, Doug Thorn and Douglas Vickery, had produced a number of designs when they learned of similar efforts at Sud Aviation under the Super-Caravelle project. Russell developed a friendship with his counterpart at Sud, Louis Giusta, which aided the eventual formation of the Concorde project. Russell became the joint chairman of the Concorde Executive Committee of Directors between 1965 and 1969. Russell was appointed chairman, Filton Division of the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) in 1968 and retired in 1969. He was also vice-chairman, BAC-Sud Aviation Concorde Committee 1969 to 1970. Russell won the RAeS British Gold Medal in 1951, was made CBE in 1954, FRS in 1970 and Knighted in 1972. With his wife Lorna he had one son and one daughter. Lorna died in 1984 and Russell married Judy Humphrey in 1986. Archibald Russell died in Angarrack, Cornwall on 29 May 1995, one day short of his 91st birthday.

Plot  The story starts out with the introduction of a peasant farmer and his wife and their three sons. The two elder sons were very clever, but the third son was a fool and was not as clever as his older brothers. One day, the Tsar of Russia proclaims that whoever builds a flying ship that can sail the sky will win the hand of his daughter, the princess. The two older brothers were eager to try their luck and their parents provided them with lavish provisions for their journey. Unfortunately, the older brothers never came back from their journey. After some time passes, the youngest son wants to try out his luck at building the flying ship. Even though his parents just mock him and said that he will probably be eaten by a pack of wolves before he makes it, they decided to let him go on the journey but gives him poor provisions for his journey. As the Fool is walking towards the woods, he meets a man with eyebrows that jump like snowhares (literally) and the man asks the Fool where he is going. The Fool tells the man that he is going to build a flying ship to win the hand of the Tsar's daughter, but he does not know how to build such a ship. The old man then asks the Fool if he has anything to eat and the Fool tells the old man that he only has enough for himself but is willing to share the meal with him. When the Fool opens the bag, his poor meal turns into a lavish meal and he and the old man spend some time eating the food. Afterwards, the Fool falls asleep on the ground and when he wakes up, he finds a large flying ship (with chicken legs attached at the bottom) standing near him. The Fool climbs into the ship and starts to sail away over the land. Along the way, the Fool meets several unusual companions on his trip, including a man who can eat everything triple his size, a man who has extremely sharp eyesight and carries a foot long gun, a man who can run faster than the wind, a man who can hear everything around the world, and a man who has incredible strength simply from his long hair. As the ship crew arrive at the Tsar's palace, the Tsar's small servant comes running to the Tsar and tells him that the ship is filled with a loud group of peasants. The Tsar is displeased at this and asks the servant what he should do about it. The servant tells the Tsar to set impossible tasks that they could never fulfill and the first task would be to eat one-thousand loaves of bread. The Fool sends the Eater to complete this task and the Eater eats all the loaves in a few seconds. The servant then sets a second task to retrieve the Equator from Africa and the Fool sends the Runner to complete this task. While in Africa, however, the Runner gets tired and falls asleep by a tree. The Fool and the others are worried about the Runner and the Sharpshooter spots the Runner sleeping by a tree in Africa and shoots at the flea that is sleeping on top of the Runner's Head. The Runner quickly runs back to the Tsar's palace and gives the equator to the Fool who gives it to the Tsar. The Tsar is deeply upset about this and so is his daughter, the princess, but the servant thinks of one last task. The servant tells the Fool to get penguins from the South Pole and to complete this task by sunup tomorrow. The Fool tells this to his friends, and while they spot the penguins, they are in a dilemma as they do not know how to get the penguins from the South Pole. The Runner suggests that he should complete this task by running to the South Pole and then bring the penguins back to Russia, but the sharp shooter objects to this, because he had already used his last bullet to wake the runner up, so if the runner were to fall asleep like last time, he couldn't be awoken. Suddenly, the Puffer wakes up from his slumber and tells the others that he is going to puff up and therefore, he transforms into a strong heavy set man. The Puffer realizes that if they couldn't go to the South Pole, then he'd have to bring the South Pole to them. He then proceeds to pull the whole land towards them to get the penguins and just as the sun rises, the Puffer finally succeeds in getting the penguins to the Tsar's palace. When the Tsar wakes up the next morning, he sees all the penguins walking all over his palace grounds and gives the Fool his daughter's hand in marriage. Everything ends happily for everyone, well maybe except for the princess, but she got used to it.  Reception  The Fool and the Flying Ship has received many positive reviews from various articles. According to an article in Entertainment Weekly, the story received an A- and is stated by Ken Tucker, \\"Drescher's drawing is as blunt and cartoonish as Williams' narration, and together they make The Fool and the Flying Ship a lot of silly fun.\\" Also, stated in an article from Chicago Sun-Times by Ernest Tucker, \\"The quicksilver Williams has a ball in his tour de force role as the slightly Yiddish-accented fool. And the Klezmer Conservatory Band adds just the right inflections with its jazzy-yet- traditional music.

It is an analogue computer that relates vital variables of the fire control problem to the movement of one's own ship and that of a target ship. It was often used with other devices, such as a Vickers range clock, to generate range and deflection data so the gun sights of the ship could be continuously set. A number of versions of the Dumaresq were produced of increasing complexity as development proceeded. Geometric principle The dumaresq relies on sliding and rotating bars and dials to calculate the relative motion of the enemy ship and to convert this into a \\"range rate\\" (the component of motion along the line of bearing) and \\"dumaresq deflection\\" (or \\"speed across\\", the component perpendicular to the range rate). Because the dumaresq is an analogue or model of the relative motion of the two ships, it does not intrinsically favour which of its settings is an input and which is an output. This allows it to be used \\"backwards\\", a process called a \\"cross cut\\" to take sequential estimates of the range and bearing of an enemy vessel and discover its speed and heading that would be consistent. Mechanical design The design of the dumaresq consists of a circular dial with a cross- bar passing over the centre which is oriented to match the heading of one's own ship. A sliding assembly can be moved backwards along a scale etched on this bar to indicate the ship's speed in knots. Suspended below the slider is a second bar, which recorded the speed and heading of the enemy ship by rotating and sliding against a similar scale to that on the main cross-bar. The result of these two settings are such that the tip of the enemy bar records enemy movement minus own movement as a vector sum. This is equivalent to the relative motion of the target ship. The base disc of the Dumaresq features a graph which can be rotated along the line of bearing. When so aligned, the axis along the line of bearing indicates the range rate and the perpendicular axis indicates speed across. A pointer stem dangling from the enemy ship bar allows the values to be easily read off in convenient units (in 1902, range rate was expressed as the number of seconds required for the range to alter 50 yards, but was soon standardised on yards per minute). Mark I The mark I Dumaresq was manufactured by Elliott Brothers, who paid for and obtained a patent on the device in the name of its inventor, John Dumaresq, in August 1904. By 1906 the device had been amended to add a rifle-like sight for directly obtaining a bearing to the target ship. By 1913 approximately 1000 devices of various versions had been purchased by the Royal Navy at a cost of ¬£10,000. Mark II The mark II Dumaresq was the same as the Mark I, but larger and was in production by Elliotts by 1907. In 1909 it was proposed to add a compass ring to the dial plate, and another mounted on the cross bar for the enemy ship. This was added to a revised Mark II and Mark III versions. Mark IV The mark IV version was developed in 1910, intended to be used within a gun turret operating independently from the centralised fire control. The device cost ¬£4.50. Mark VI This version included a hand wheel on the side, which rotated the dial plate, and with it the enemy bar. Relative direction of the enemy ship could be maintained to within a few degrees during a turn of the \\"own ship\\". In 1908 Frederic Dreyer suggested an improvement, adding gears so that the enemy bar would alter direction automatically when the dial plate was rotated. This allowed an automatic correction of enemy direction as the home ship changed course. A similar \\"helm-free\\" Mark VI* model with a range and bearing clock and fixed dial plate permitted a gyrocompass input to automatically track own ship as it altered course, and was the one incorporated in the Dreyer Fire Control Table Mark III and III*. Such equipment was quite specialized to a larger fire control context. The electrical dumaresq This model is the zenith in complexity for the dumaresq, and was created for use in the most modern Dreyer tables of WWI, the Mark IV and IV*. The electrical dumaresq's special features were very particular to its use in the Dreyer FCTs in which it was fitted, sitting atop a range clock. Like the Mark VI*, it was helm-free, a gyro applied own course continuously, and a bearing clock tried to keep the bearing plate set appropriately. Its new wrinkle was an elaborate electrical device which would, when engaged, continuously and automatically apply the indicated range rate to its range clock and convert the indicated speed-across to a gunnery deflection at the present range. These special accoutrements were overtaking the inherent complexity of the dumaresqs themselves. Mark VIII This dumaresq (as Admiralty pattern 5969A) lasted into service through WWII. It was compact, had a fixed cross-bar and special gearing maintained enemy heading when alterations to own heading were made. All adjustments were manual on this model. A special graph spindle in the dial plate oriented along the speed- across axis could be spun to the present gun range and could quickly convert the speed-across to a gun deflection. That this was done by simple thumb work suggests that this dumaresq was meant to operate in the absence of advanced systems such as the Admiralty Fire Control Table that was then in service. Wind dumaresq Before World War I was over, a specialised dumaresq proposed by Captain FC Dreyer was incorporated into the Dreyer Fire Control Table alongside the main one to track and nullify the influence of cross-range winds on the shells as they flew toward the target. In the wind dumaresq, the vector bars subtracted own ship's motion from the real wind vector to produce the relative wind vector, which was called \\"wind you feel\\". A rolling spindle graph across the dial plate was spun to the present gun range and its markings indicated an additional correction to deflection to be applied to the gun sights in order to negate the crosswind's influence. This figure was read off by projecting the vector sum pipper to the roller graph. Post WWI The more sophisticated dumaresqs slowly died out after WWI, their functionality being manifested in other hardware. The design of the dumaresq was not well-suited to integration in larger schemes of automated fire control. A wind dumaresq, however, can still be found in the transmitting stations of and . Simple dumaresqs of almost regressive simplicity continued to be issued through WWII in auxiliaries and transports. Mark XI An example of the Spartan dumaresqs that survived beyond World War I, these were very simple, with fixed cross- bars and an own-speed of 12 knots that could not be altered. The standard speed suggests it was intended for use in transport type ships in convoy. The dial plate lacks markings for range rate, implying the fire control staff of the ship would have no range clock at all and that this device was solely to give an idea of what deflection should be used on the gun sights. A further indication that these were to be used by less intensively trained personnel is that the dial plate helpfully features an image of a gun muzzle which is to be pointed toward the enemy ship. Mark XII These were nearly identical to the Mark XI model, but had range rate markings on its dial plate. It must have been for convoy vessels with at least a Vickers range clock whose rate could be set according to this indication.

The facility can be any large facility that is designed, fabricated, constructed and installed, operated, maintained and modified; for example, a complete infrastructural network, a process plant, a building, a highway, a ship or an airplane. The difference with a product model is that a product model is typically a model about a kind of product expressed as a data structure, whereas a facility information model typically is an integration of 1000‚Äì10,000 components and their properties and relations and 10,000‚Äì50,000 documents. A facility information model is intended for users that search for data and documents about the components of the facility and their operation. A Facility Information Model can be an instantiation of a fixed data model or it can be expressed in a flexible modeling language such as Gellish English. A facility information model about a plant, a building, etc. is usually called a Plant Information Model, a Building Information Model, etc. A Facility Information Model can be created according to various modeling methods. For example, the Gellish Modeling Method enables to model it in a system- independent and computer-interpretable way. This means that the model can be imported and managed in any system that is able to read Gellish English expressions. A facility information model is in principle system independent and only deals with data and document content.  Architecture  A Facility Information Model consists of at least the following sections: 1\\\\. A Facility Model, which may include processes and activities 2\\\\. A Documents and Data sets section 3\\\\. An electronic Common Dictionary And possibly also: 4\\\\. Requirements Models The Facility Model A Facility Model describes a facility, primarily in a breakdown structure that specifies a decomposition hierarchy of the facility. For example, the facility may be decomposed in sections, whereas each section is decomposed in units and utility systems, which are further decomposed in equipment systems, control loops, sub-systems, which are decomposed in pieces of equipment, building components, etc. as far as required. The Facility Model consists partly of the facts (data) that are expressed as relations between the components and their properties and relations to other 'objects'. That data reflects the facility and its operation and its properties. Documents and data sets section Another section of the Facility Information Model consists of documents and data sets in various formats. Each of those documents and data sets is related to the element in the facility model about which the document or data set contains information. Electronic Common Dictionary Each facility model component, property, activity as well as each document and data set shall be defined. This is normally done by classification. The classes (concepts) that classify the objects are defined in an electronic Common Dictionary. To ensure consistency and communication between systems and other parties that dictionary is also an integral part of every Facility Information Model. Requirements Models The quality of a Facility Information Model is determined by its completeness, consistency, up-to-dateness and accessibility. To measure that quality it is necessary to define requirements. This is preferably done in a computer interpretable way. These requirements and standard specifications have the nature of relations between kinds of things.  Implementation  A facility information model can be implemented in various ways. The essence is that the user of a system by which the data and documents are accessed should experience it as one integrated system.

The seventh tropical depression, sixth named storm, and third hurricane of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season, Fausto formed out of a tropical wave on July 16\\\\. The storm gradually strengthened as it moved towards the west-northwest, becoming a minimal hurricane two days later. On July 19, Fausto turned towards the northwest as it continued to strengthen. The next day, while passing between the Mexican islands of Clarion and Socorro, the hurricane reached its peak intensity with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 977 mbar (hPa; 28.85 inHg). Fausto steadily weakened throughout the following two days as it moved over progressively cooler waters. By July 21, the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm and a tropical depression the next day. Early on July 23, the depression lacked deep convection and degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. The low persisted for another day before dissipating over open waters. Hurricane Fausto had little effect on land, despite passing close to the islands of Clarion and Socorro where high winds, reaching hurricane-force on Socorro, were recorded. Moderate rainfall from the outer bands of the storm amounted to 1.9 in (50 mm) in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. Meteorological history The origins of Hurricane Fausto were in a westward-traveling tropical wave that moved off the eastern coast of Africa on July 4\\\\. Little development occurred as the wave traversed the Atlantic basin. It entered the eastern Pacific basin on July 12 after crossing Central America and began to show signs of development the next day. The system westward movement became slightly erratic on July 14 as development slowed. The following day, the system became increasingly organized and a tropical depression, which was designated 07-E, formed about 550 mi (890 km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. The depression maintained an area of deep convection around the center of circulation and was located within an area of moderate wind shear. An area of high pressure located over the southwestern United States was forecast to steer the system towards the northwest for most of its existence. A mid-level ridge located to the north of the depression caused it to rapidly travel towards the west at 23 mph (37 km/h) for most of July 16. Shortly after being designated as a depression, 17-E was upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Fausto. Despite being partially exposed from convection, the system featured several banding features which supported a wind intensity of 40 mph (65 km/h). As a large cyclone, Fausto slowly intensified, with convection consolidating around the center the next day. The combination of relaxing wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures allowed the storm to intensify. Later that day, the center of Fausto became exposed but a large band of deep convection surrounded the exposed low. Early on July 18, a banding eye feature began to develop in the southern portion of the storm. Around this time, forward motion slowed as it began to turn towards the northeast. Later that day, a partial eyewall began to develop, indicating that Fausto had strengthened into a hurricane with winds reaching 75 mph (120 km/h). Tropical Storm Fausto off the Mexican coast on July 17 Shortly after being declared a hurricane, the eye started to appear on visible satellite imagery. With low wind shear and warm waters, further intensification was anticipated. Very cold cloud tops with temperatures as low as ‚Äì112 ¬∞F (‚Äì80 ¬∞C) surrounded the developing eye allowing the storm to intensify. Strengthening stopped for most of July 19 and the first half of July 20. That day, Fausto strengthened slightly as a ragged eye formed while the storm passed between the islands of Clarion and Socorro. At this time, the hurricane reached its peak intensity with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 977 mbar (hPa; 28.85 inHg). Operationally, Fausto was assessed to have reached its peak intensity several hours later as a minimal Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) as the eye became better defined. However, the storm was located over 75 ¬∞F (24 ¬∞C) waters, causing it to gradually weaken along with diminishing convective activity. Later that day, Fausto was downgraded to a tropical storm and further weakened to a tropical depression the next day. With little or no remaining convection, the system degenerated into a remnant low pressure area as it traveled towards the west-northwest. The remnants of Fausto dissipated on July 24, while located about 1,065 mi (1,715 km) west of Cabo San Lucas. Preparations and impact The National Hurricane Center did not forecast Fausto to affect any major land areas during its existence. As such, no tropical cyclone advisories were issued. The outer bands of Fausto produced moderate rainfall over portions of Sinaloa, Mexico, peaking at 1.9 in (50 mm). Several hours before the center of Fausto passed between Clarion Island and Socorro Island, sustained winds on Clarion were recorded at 64 mph (103 km/h) with gusts to 94 mph (151 km/h). Nearby Socorro recorded sustained winds of 79 mph (129 km/h) with gusts to 109 mph (175 km/h). Little or no damage was recorded on the islands. The hurricane-force winds reported on Socorro was recorded as Fausto made its closest approach to the island about 115 mi (185 km) to the southwest. However, due to the distance from the center of Fausto, these winds are suspected to be overestimated. Along the coastline of Mexico, waves up to were recorded in relation to Fausto.

The San Diego Art Institute was initially founded in 1941 as the San Diego Business Men's Art Club. In 1950 the name was changed to the San Diego Art Institute, and three years later women were allowed membership into the organization. SDAI became a nonprofit in 1963 and was dedicated to showcasing artists from the Southern California/Baja Norte region. In preparation for its 75th Anniversary, in 2014 under the leadership of Executive Director Ginger Shulick Porcella (2014-2017), the San Diego Art Institute shifted its focus. The San Diego Art Institute is now recognized as an experimental, bi-national contemporary art center with a focus on the artists of Southern California and Northern Baja. History San Diego Art Institute in Balboa Park In 1941, a group of San Diego businessmen met in the office of then Director of the Fine Arts Gallery in Balboa Park, Reginald Poland. These men were interested in forming a group, which would have as its chief objective the painting of local characteristic and historical scenes of San Diego and vicinity. Following the organizational meeting, invitations were issued to painters known to be interested in preserving the memories of the fast disappearing early landmarks of San Diego County. In May, a re-organizational meeting was held, at which time the name \\"San Diego Business Men‚Äôs Art Club\\" was adopted. The first president was Walter W. Austin, former Mayor of San Diego. The first instructor of this group was Maurice Braun, well known in all of southern California for his mellow California landscapes as well as for his unusual teaching ability. Otto Schneider, Alfred R. Mitchell and many others also acted as instructors of this enthusiastic outdoor painting group. Exhibitions of the work of club members were held at various places; the first one-man show to be held by a member of this original group was by Charles Small in Bohnen‚Äôs Studio at Fifth and Laurel Streets. In 1942 the San Diego Business Men‚Äôs Art Club negotiated with the City for studio quarters in the Spanish Village in Balboa Park. Before this arrangement could be consummated, World War II intervened; Balboa Park was requisitioned for use in the war effort. During the war the Club was relatively inactive, except for a member exhibition in the La Jolla Art Center in June 1944. After the end of the war, interest in the project was revived and the club was reorganized at a meeting held on April 4, 1947. During this year increasing activity was generated and many fine outdoor painting sessions resulted, including one at the Pine Hills ranch of Fred Heilbron, one of the original members. Several exhibitions of paintings by old and new members were held, one of which was at the San Diego Club with an attendance of more than 140 people. During this year E. H. Pohl and Ben Vaganoff were added to the list of club instructors. The original San Diego Business Men's Art Club, circa 1947 During 1948, increased interest and enthusiasm was manifested by alternate Saturday painting trips by the membership to various sites in San Diego County. The all-county Art Mart held in November of that year at 6th and Laurel streets was under the chairmanship of one of their instructors, Alfred R. Mitchell. Most of the members of the San Diego Business Men‚Äôs Art Club participated in this activity, which greatly increased the public interest in the organization. For a number of years following the 1948 Art Mart this activity was under the chairmanship of a member of the San Diego Business Men‚Äôs Art Club. In 1949 the efforts of the club were increased and expanded. Exhibitions were held in numerous business establishments, hotels and schools. In 1950 these exhibitions were extended to outlying locations such as the Hoberg Hotel in Borrego Springs and the Carlsbad Hotel in Carlsbad. Headquarters The San Diego Business Men's Art Club had grown in activities and public relations to such an extent that a headquarters and gallery were sorely needed. During World War II the Fine Arts Society of San Diego was forced to evacuate its galleries in Balboa Park and move, originally to 2324 Pine Street,San Diego City Directory 1943; http://history.sdvag.net/Chapter%20IV.htm and then to 2030 Sunset Boulevard, a fine old home which was a gift of Mr. and Mrs. Frank E. Marcy to the Fine Arts Society for use as its wartime temporary headquarters. Following the return of the Fine Arts Society to its galleries in Balboa Park after the war, the Sunset Galleries were left vacant. E. T. Price, at that time president of the Fine Arts Society, offered the use of the gallery at 2030 Sunset Boulevard for its headquarters and gallery; many exhibitions, social affairs, classes, lectures, and educational and cultural meetings were held there. Exhibitions of club's workwere held continuously, with the show changed at monthly intervals. Visiting exhibitions were held, not only of paintings but of photography and other arts and crafts. Field painting excursions continued e under the supervision and instruction of one of the faculty members. During this time Alfred E. R. Van de Veide, Carlos Verharen, J. Milford Ellison, J. Roland McNary and Earl Schrack were added to the faculty, while Elsey Taft became curator. In 1951 the membership voted to incorporate under the name of ‚ÄúThe San Diego Men‚Äôs Art Institute\\" and to accept women as associate members. The membership promptly rose to more than fifty regular members and more than one hundred associate members. With the advent of women as associate members, activities increased markedly, and, with the Sunset galleries becoming available, increased quality of the work submitted for exhibitions was noted. Organization San Diego Art Institute is a contemporary art center, focusing on the artists and audiences of Southern California/Baja Norte. Their core programs include rotating, curated exhibitions of regional contemporary art, as well as a premier artist and curator residency program. SDAI has a main exhibition space in Balboa Park, 8,000 square feet dedicated to contemporary exhibitions. As of November 2015, SDAI also has a secondary 3,000 square foot project space in Westfield Horton Plaza Mall, dedicated to hands- on artmaking workshops, experimental performances, rotating exhibitions, and artist studios. SDAI exhibits artwork by artists mainly living and working in the Southern California/Baja Norte region (Los Angeles to Tijuana). While past programs have focused solely on monthly regional juried exhibitions, SDAI has shifted their focus towards themed and curated exhibitions. Opportunities for artists are frequently posted on their website. Past notable exhibitions include: \\"Millennial Pink\\" curated by Lissa Corona and Marina Grize, ‚ÄúBeyond Limits: Postglobal Mediations‚Äù, ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Work: Masculinity and Gender in Contemporary Fiber Art‚Äù curated by Ginger Shulick Porcella, ‚ÄúSweet Gongs Vibrating‚Äù curated by Amanda Cachia, ‚ÄúUniversal Dissolvent‚Äù, and ‚ÄúEphemeral Objects‚Äù. Notable artists that have participated in exhibitions include: Angela Washko, Andrea Chung, Blane de St. Croix, Mary Mattingly, Pablo Helguera, Einar & Jamex de la Torre, Debby and Larry Kline, etc. In 2014, SDAI instituted an artist-in-residence program. Past artists-in-residence include: Andrea Chung, Matthew Mahoney, Nina Preisendorfer, Cindy Santos Bravo, Vabianna Santos, Robert Andrade, Omar Lopex, Brian & Ryan, and Michelada Think Tank. Past curators-in-residence include: Alex Young, Andy Horwitz, and Amanda Cachia. The House of Charm The House of Charm was called the Indian Arts Building when it was originally created for the Panama-California Exposition in 1916. The lath and plaster structure was renamed the Russia and Brazil Building in 1917, the Exposition's second year. It acquired its current name, the House of Charm, during the California Pacific International Exposition in 1935. Like many other Exposition buildings within the Park, the House of Charm was taken over by the military during World War II. In 1996, because of deterioration, the building was torn down and rebuilt to its original appearance. Represented on the National Register of Historical Places, the House of Charm is now home to the San Diego Art Institutes's Museum of the Living Artist as well as the Mingei International Museum and three full-scale rehearsal spaces belonging to the Old Globe Theatre. Education SDAI promotes multimedia art education through school art programs, summer camps, and individualized youth art education initiatives. They hire practicing artists making important contributions to their fields who have also demonstrated a vested interest in the capacity of art to empower young people. In 2015 SDAI started a Teen Summer Intensive, now housed at Coronado School of the Arts. SDAI also provides frequent opportunities for youth to exhibit their artwork in Balboa Park. Professional Development Workshops SDAI hosts frequent professional development workshops for artists and arts administrators. These workshops equip artists to develop and maintain their careers by encouraging collaboration, networking, and perhaps most importantly, information sharing.

Its manufacturer nicknamed it the Pirate, but this name was not officially adopted by the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC).  Design and development The LB-5 was a member of the family of closely related bomber designs that had debuted with the XLB-1 in 1923, and as such, was a large, single-bay, conventional biplane. Like most of the family, it was a twin-engine machine, with engines mounted in nacelles on the lower wing. The prototype XLB-5 had a single tail fin like the XLB-1, the 10 LB-5 production machines were designed with a triple-finned tail under the Huff-Daland name, but the final batch of 25 was redesigned with twin tails and designated LB-5A. Operational history Its Liberty L-12 engines featured duralumin adjustable-pitch propellers built by the Standard Steel Propeller Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, (forerunner of the Hamilton Standard Propeller Company). At least nine tests of tensile strength were made of its propeller blades between 1925 and 1927, one of which reported failure after 34 hours of flying time and 10 hours of testing.Miller, Dr. Roger G. \\"Four 'Caterpillars' and a funeral documents on the crash of the Huff-Daland XLB-5.\\" Air Power History, Fall 2002.

Shrapnel sprayed the five-man crew, which included 2nd Bombardment Group commander Major Lewis H. Brereton, flying co-pilot, and all except the nosegunner immediately parachuted. The nosegunner died in the crash, and the gasoline-soaked wreckage subsequently exploded and burned on the ground.

He was the sixth (but fourth surviving) son of John VI, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, by his wife Sophie Auguste, daughter of Frederick III, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp. Life After the death of his father in 1667, John Louis inherited the town of Dornburg with the title of prince. Because he was still a minor, his mother, the Dowager Princess Sophie Auguste, acted as regent on behalf of him and his brothers. In 1672, the sixteen-year-old John Louis began his Grand Tour with his older brother Karl William in Regensburg. There they reunited with their middle brothers Anthony G√ºnther and John Adolph, who had just returned from a journey to Italy. The four princes became honored guests of the Emperor Leopold I in Vienna, and were allowed to kiss his hand. During his stay at the Imperial court, John Louis and his brothers took the opportunity to make contacts and extend their knowledge. Afterwards the young brothers returned to Zerbst. They enjoyed their time together very much, and it created a deep and lifelong bond between them. Another journey already planned for John Louis in 1674 was frustrated. He was appointed to go to Italy with the Hereditary Prince Augustus Frederick, eldest son and heir of Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel; although all necessary preparations were ready, the trip had to be cancelled because John Louis broke his leg. During the next three years he suffered severe pain. The physicians were unable to set his bones correctly and only gave him analgesics. But finally, the prince recovered fully. In the meantime, his brother Karl William had taken over the government of Anhalt- Zerbst and the custody of the brothers and sister who were still minors. During his stay in Vienna John Louis also made trips to Hungary, which belonged to the Habsburg Empire. He inspected the fortresses of Raab (now Gy≈ër, north-west Hungary) and Comorra (now Kom√°rom, on the border with Slovakia). From Vienna he traveled via Salzburg and Tyrol to Venice and Rome. At the Vatican, he spoke with several cardinals and other church dignitaries at the papal court. He also had several audiences with Pope Innocent XI. The following year, in 1678, John Louis travelled further south and visited Naples, Sicily, and Malta; there, he was chosen as Grand Master of the Order of St. John (Johanniterordens). In November 1678 he finally made the return journey home. He went by boat from Malta to Livorno (Tuscany) on the west coast of Italy and stopped in Florence. He spent some time at the Florentine court of Grand Duke Cosimo III and met the other members of the grand ducal family. During this time he was highly honored; John Louis then moved again to Venice. From there he crossed Italy to the Mediterranean and stayed in the cities of Mantua, Modena, Parma, and Genoa. From Genoa, he traveled further and visited the fortress of Casale in Monferrato and Turin. In the latter city he met Queen Marie-Th√©r√®se of France, wife of King Louis XIV, who was extremely polite and accommodating to him. John Louis spent two years in Italy, then went back to Zerbst. His trip was extensive and educational in all respects. His older brother Karl William received him enthusiastically upon his return. But in early 1681, the year when he began construction on Schloss Zerbst, he started traveling again. He visited the Netherlands and France, but after two years, John Louis returned home. John Louis's military career was a minor activity for him. During his trips the fortresses he visited interested him only marginally. Nevertheless, in 1684 he joined the imperial army and held the rank of captain. Perhaps it was financial considerations that forced him to do so. He served in a regiment under the command of General von Scharfenberg and supervised an unsuccessful siege of a Hungarian fortress. The campaign was a disaster, but John Louis did acquire experience. Only two years later, in 1686, the army was able to take the fortress. John Louis's military career ended there, and he returned to the civilian life. Back home, he began to build his Schloss in Dornburg. Marriage and issue In Halle on 23 July 1687, John Louis married Christine Eleonore of Zeutsch (b. Hedersleben near Eisleben, 5 June 1666 ‚Äì d. Dornburg, 17 May 1699), of an old Thuringian noble family. The circumstances of their courtship are not known. However, it is certain that it was not a political marriage, since it was clearly morganatic. They had seven children: * John Louis II, Prince of Anhalt-Dornburg, later Anhalt-Zerbst (b. Dornburg, 23 June 1688 ‚Äì d. Zerbst, 5 November 1746). * John Augustus, Prince of Anhalt-Dornburg (b. Dornburg, 31 December 1689 ‚Äì d. Exiles, Dauphin√©, 22 August 1709). * Christian Augustus, Prince of Anhalt- Dornburg, later Anhalt-Zerbst (b. Dornburg, 29 November 1690 ‚Äì d. Zerbst, 16 March 1747). * Christian Louis, Prince of Anhalt-Dornburg (b. Dornburg, 5 November 1691 ‚Äì killed in action at Aire, Flanders, 20 October 1710). * Sophie Christiane (b. Dornburg, 16 December 1692 ‚Äì d. Zerbst, 3 May 1747). * Eleonore Auguste (b. Dornburg, 13 May 1694 ‚Äì d. Dornburg, 11 June 1704). * John Frederick, Prince of Anhalt-Dornburg (b. Dornburg, 14 July 1695 ‚Äì d. Schaffhausen, 11 May 1742), married to Cajetana of Sperling (d. Schaffhausen, 17 December 1742), a childless union. When a family compact was submitted to the Emperor for confirmation in 1689, John Louis obtained from the Emperor the insertion of a clause protecting the rights of his children as born of a legitimate and lawful marriage. In 1693 Karl Frederick, the younger son of John Louis's eldest brother, died, leaving only one sibling, the later Prince John Augustus; John Louis's next two older brothers were either unmarried or without male heirs, which made the possibility that the Zerbst inheritance would pass to his line more likely. Consequently, he took further steps to insure the succession for his children, and on 7 January 1698 secured an Imperial Decree making the children of his marriage princes and princesses of Anhalt. Indeed, they were considered dynastic, and at the death without heirs of Prince John Augustus in 1742, the surviving sons of John Louis succeeded him.

The film stars non-professional actors Venkatesh Chavan and Jhangir Badshah, as well as Bollywood veteran Nana Patekar and newcomer Ayesha Mohan. The story revolves around a young janitor working at a hotel in the port city of Panjim, India, who sees from his perch in a mango tree a luxuriant garden and shimmering pool hidden behind a wall. In making whatever efforts he can to better himself, Venkatesh offers his services to the wealthy owner of the home. Not content to simply dream about a different life, Venkatesh is inquisitive about the home's inhabitants and his curiosity changes the shape of his future. Though filmed in Hindi, a language Smith didn't know, the film earned good reviews. Besides winning a Special Jury prize at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, the film won accolades from Geoffrey Gilmore, director of the Sundance Film Festival. In the same year, it was screened at the Vienna International Film Festival and International Film Festival of India. The DVD was released on 13 July 2010.  Production  After American Job (1996), American Movie (1999), Home Movie (2001) and The Yes Men (2003), Milwaukee-based director Chris Smith read a story, written by Randy Russel, about a person from a graduate school in Iowa. This person, who is out running, sees a swimming pool and gets obsessed with swimming in it. He follows around the people who own the place and tries to befriend them. However, Smith clarified that the film's story evolved from it in a \\"completely different way from there\\". He said that though they had a draft in hand while beginning the shooting, his goal was to let the environment (the actors, their experiences and observations) shape the story. The film is a collaborative result of a crew that was half-based in India and United States. The crew included producer Kate Noble, creative consultant Xavier Leplae, whose film I'm Bobby was shot in the Indian state of Goa. Xavier's brother, Didier Leplae, who composed the score with Joe Wong in Milwaukee, had it arranged by a Bollywood composer, and recorded by a small orchestra in Mumbai. The film also credits independent film representative and producer John Sloss, who has handled all of his films, as being his \\"conduit to the rest of the world,\\" and said that it was Sloss' work on his behalf that \\"has allowed me to stay in Milwaukee.\\" Barry Poltermann, who edited The Pool and American Movie, continued his association with Smith with this film. Though the story was originally set in Iowa, Smith chose the port city of Panjim, Goa due to his long-time fascination with the city, especially the contrast between the rich and the poor. For the 65-day shoot, Smith and his crew moved to India for a five-month period. While referring to this cinematic endeavour as an experiment, he felt that the journey to India was crucial in clearing up his creative space to work. Smith once thought of aborting the project because they were unsuccessful in locating a bungalow with a pool. Eventually, they managed to lease one from a New Zealand-born India-based person.  Casting  Saying that this film was the hardest he ever worked on in his life, Smith added that casting for the film was quite a challenge. The crew lost three lead actors due to various reasons. While one of them went to Mumbai on the pretext of buying karate uniforms and never returned, a young girl could not obtain permission for leave from school. The actor originally chosen for the father's role left them for a television series. These unfortunate incidents happened three days prior to commencement of the shoot. After a casting director, who had previously worked with Ayesha Mohan, sent them her details, she was chosen to play the main actress. Speaking about how they identified Nana Patekar, a veteran Bollywood actor, Smith said: > When you're trying to cast, you will look anywhere and everywhere. At > dinner, we would look at the waiters. And one day, this newspaper came (to > their hotel room) with a story on Nana (Patekar). And it said that he takes > his time between movies and likes to do interesting projects. And Kate > thought he looked perfect. We liked his eyes and the way he handled himself > in the interview. And he seemed a kindred spirit to what we were trying to > do. Smith was convinced that if Patekar agreed to play the role, the film would get a boost. Actress Mohan helped him approach Anurag Kashyap, who directed her in the Bollywood film Black Friday (2004). Initially, Patekar was not interested to do the film. But Kashyap urged him to take a look at 45 minutes of the film's footage. Upon watching it, Patekar remained quiet for some time and then he said, \\"this reminds me of what we used to do before we got corrupted.\\" According to Smith, Patekar not just played his character, but also helped out in various scenes while filming. 20-year-old Venkatesh Chavan, who played the role of the young boy fascinated by the pool, originally hailed from Mundargi town in Gadag district of Karnataka. Chavan's parents left for Goa in search of work. While Smith was in the process of casting, Venkatesh was helping his parents to sell scrap. In January 2006, when he was roaming on the streets of Vasco da Gama, Smith met him, introduced himself and asked him to act in his film. Venkatesh took his parents' permission and agreed. His mother and sister were asked to play the role of his mother and sister in the film as well. He received INR 60,000 as compensation for acting in the film. While filming, Chavan thought it was a documentary. Jhangir, who was selected to play the 11-year-old character, worked as an employee in a bar/restaurant.

The great thing was I could think of a scene at night and we could shoot it the next morning ‚Äì give the tape to the editor at lunch and see it in the cut the next night.\\" ‚ÄîChris Smith, director } Neither of the young leads could read, so they couldn't really prepare their scenes in advance. They had to rehearse on the spot and once they got it right, the scene was shot. Another complication was their language. Since neither of them spoke English, it was difficult for Smith to directly convey detailed direction. Hence, with a translator in place, it could easily get translated in the wrong way. Another challenge was that the film was being shot in Hindi, which was not the first language of either of them. In addition, Smith had absolutely no knowledge of Hindi. Effectively, they were being directed in a language they did not understand and having to shoot complex dialogue scenes in a language alien to them. Poltermann was editing while the filming was in progress. Smith thought that this process had a huge impact on the finished film. Critical reception The film appeared on several critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008. Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle named it the 4th best film of 2008, Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter named it the 4th best film of 2008, and Tasha Robinson of The A.V.

The film stars Patrick O'Neal and cult actress Mary Woronov in leading roles, with John Carradine in a supporting performance. The plot follows a series of murders that occur in a small New England town on Christmas Eve after a man inherits a family estate which was once an insane asylum. Many of the cast and crew members were former Warhol superstars: Mary Woronov, Ondine, Candy Darling, Kristen Steen, Tally Brown, Lewis Love, filmmaker Jack Smith and artist Susan Rothenberg. It was filmed in Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York in 1970 but was not released theatrically until 1972 under the alternate titles Night of the Dark Full Moon, and in 1981 as Death House (sometimes stylized as Deathouse). Although it is attributed to Zora Investments Associates in the credits, the film was never registered with the United States Copyright Office, and thus fell into the public domain.  Plot  Silent Night, Bloody Night (full film) On Christmas Eve 1950, Wilfred Butler dies in a burning accident outside his mansion in East Willard, Massachusetts. The residence is bequeathed to his grandson, Jeffrey. Twenty years later, in 1970, lawyer John Carter arrives in East Willard on Christmas Eve with his assistant and mistress Ingrid, having been charged by Jeffrey to sell the house. Carter meets with the town's leading citizens: Mayor Adams; Sheriff Bill Mason; the mute Charlie Towman, who owns the local newspaper; and Tess Howard, who operates the town's telephone switchboard. They all agree to buy the Butler mansion on behalf of the town for the bargain price of $50,000, which Jeffrey requires to be paid in cash the next day. Carter and Ingrid spend the night at the Butler mansion, but are brutally murdered in bed with an axe by an unseen assailant. After the murders, the killer places a crucifix in Ingrid's hand and proceeds to phone the sheriff, introducing himself as the house's owner and asking him to investigate Carter's disappearance. While talking with Tess, who forwards his call, the killer calls himself \\"Marianne\\". At nightfall, Jeffrey arrives at the mansion to meet with Carter, but finds it locked and empty. He drives to the mayor's home, where he meets Diane, the mayor's daughter. The mayor has gone to the county's bank to obtain the required cash for the payment, so she redirects Jeffrey to the sheriff's office. Simultaneously, the sheriff heads to the mansion, but first stops at Wilfred Butler's disturbed gravesite, where he is beaten to death with a shovel. Failing to locate the sheriff, Jeffrey returns to the mayor's home, where Diane tells him she has received phone calls for her father from someone named \\"Marianne\\" who beckons her to the mansion. Puzzled by the strange events, Jeffrey and Diane decide to drive to the mansion, but stop after they find the sheriff's abandoned car. The two stop by the newspaper office, where they meet Charlie, who informs them Tess has also gone to the mansion. Jeffrey and Charlie go after her while Diane researches the Butler house's history in the archives. Diane manages to piece together the Butlers' story: In 1930, Wilfred's wife died of tuberculosis. In 1933, his daughter 15-year-old daughter Marianne was raped and got pregnant; the son she gives birth to is Jeffrey, who was sent away to California. In 1935, Wilfred converted the mansion into a mental hospital and had Marianne committed. The rest of the story has apparently been redacted. Tess arrives at the mansion and finds the sheriff's car running outside. In the foyer, she is greeted by the unseen killer, who bludgeons her to death with a candlestick. Jeffrey meanwhile arrives at Tess's house and finds it empty, after which he returns to Diane at the newspaper office. Diane tells Jeffrey that, based on her research, his mother did not die during his birth like he had thought. Jeffrey and Diane depart together to the mansion. En route, they pass Charlie's car, which has been set on fire; moments later, Charlie throws himself at Jeffrey's car and Jeffrey runs him over, killing him. Examining the body, Jeffrey realizes someone has cut Charlie's hands off. At the mansion, Jeffrey finds his grandfather's diary in the foyer, which reveals he was the one who got Marianne pregnant. The diary recounts how Wilfred grew hostile toward the complacent hospital staff, so on Christmas Eve 1935, he freed the hospital's patients, causing a massacre that resulted in Marianne's death as well. He then ended up faking his death in 1950 and has been living anonymously in a nearby mental hospital ever since before escaping. Jeffrey tells Diane that his grandfather/father is still alive, and that the sheriff, Tess, Towman and the mayor were all former inmates Wilfred sought revenge on for the death of Marianne. The mayor arrives at the mansion armed with a rifle, and he and Jeffrey open fire, killing each other. The killer, revealed to be the elderly Wilfred Butler, finally appears, and Diane grabs Jeffrey's gun and shoots him dead. A year later, Diane takes one last look at the Butler mansion before it is destroyed by a bulldozer crew.  Cast  Production Principal photography for Silent Night, Bloody Night began on November 30, 1970 in Oyster Bay, New York. The James W. Beekman house in Oyster Bay served as the Butler home in the film. The film originally had the working title Zora, which was the title of an unrelated screenplay owned by Cannon Films. Post-production took place in the summer of 1972, with director Gershuny and editor Tom Kennedy completing dubbing, scoring, and sound effects. Star Mary Woronov recalled of the production: \\"Silent Night, Bloody Night was terrible. We were given a weird script, and Ted [Gershuny] tried to spark it up. He tried to make it an artistic statement, but it didn't work. It didn't even make much sense. Most people couldn't understand what was going on‚Äìwhich is not good, particularly for a horror film.\\" Release The film was given a limited release in the United States under the title Night of the Full Dark Moon through Cannon Films, beginning November 17, 1972. It was subsequently released as Silent Night, Bloody Night in the spring of 1973, and continued to screen under this title through December 1973. It subsequently screened in Australia in December 1974. The same year Stiges Film Festival in Spain screened the film as official selection. The film was released once again in 1981 by Cannon under the title Death House, stylized as Deathouse in some advertisements and on the film's title card. In 1974, television broadcasting rights to the film were sold to CBS for $300,000, who subsequently screened it as late-night movie. The film was also shown on Elvira's Movie Macabre, part of WWOR-TV's Fright Night beginning in 1978, and became a staple of late-night television in the November and December months. Despite the film's dark subject matter and depictions of violence, the network chose to air it at Christmastime each year. Executive Larry Casey commented on it, saying, \\"Don't get me wrong. I loved White Christmas and traditional holiday movies. But how many times can you watch those things? We always pushed the envelope on Fright Night, and Silent Night, Bloody Night was a great fit. WOR never got any complaints for showing it that I heard about.\\"  Critical response  Upon its initial release, Michael Pitts of the Anderson Daily Bulletin criticized the film for having an unclear plotline and being \\"poorly photographed.\\" He concluded by writing that the film \\"is so bad it could have been made for television, but on the other hand most of today's TV films are better than this.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald noted: \\"The exact plot of the family mania is hard to follow but by the time the whole revolting theme of madness and butchery has been run through the thud of axe against flesh has obliterated any artistic purpose.\\" AllMovie called it a \\"minor gem\\", complementing the film's \\"eerie atmosphere\\" and noting its place as a predecessor to the slasher film genre. Leonard Maltin gave the film two stars, calling it an \\"uneven low- budgeter.\\" The film was featured in the book 150 Movies You Should Die Before You See, where it was written that the film \\"manages to disappoint on every level.\\" Film historian Brian Albright referred to the film as \\"moody... surreal, and sometimes confusing.\\" In his book Slasher Films: An International Filmography, 1960 Through 2001, Kent Byron Armstrong wrote that the film \\"has a lethargic pace, but it provides enough intrigue and mystery to help a viewer retain interest.\\" In Nightmare USA: The Untold Story of the Exploitation Independents (2007), Stephen Thrower wrote: \\"[the film is] ‚Äúpainfully slow... plotted for maximum irritation, with a deferred mystery structure that will have you screaming with impatience after the first hour.\\" In a review published by The Hysteria Lives!, the film was awarded five out of five stars, with the reviewer noting: \\"The rather soap-operish proceedings are very involved, but suffice it to say, there's more than enough bodies to please the slasher purists while entertaining those of us who enjoy a classic macabre tale as well.\\" John Kenneth Muir noted that the film \\"bears all [the] reassuring tell-tale signs of a bad movie, signs that today's garbage might avoid through expense: amateur editing and filming, bad sound, bad film stock, atrocious dialogue, and the rest. Still, at least you know where you stand with a movie like Silent Night, Bloody Night. It doesn't take long to realize that you're trapped in bad movie hell.\\" Home media Although there is a 1972 copyright statement in the opening credits for Zora Investment Associates, the film was not registered for copyright, and since its release has fallen into public domain. After the film's video release by Paragon Video in the 1980s, The film is available on DVD from various entertainment companies that specialize in public domain films, though many of the prints on these editions are of extremely poor quality. The majority of the prints used on DVDs were sourced from the VHS transfer released by Paragon Video. A high- definition restored print of the film (sourced from the original master of the Death House print) was released on DVD by Film Chest on December 10, 2013. The same print was also used for a DVD release by boutique company Code Red in 2013, in a limited edition double feature paired with Invasion of the Blood Farmers (1972). Influence Some elements of the film have been noted as influential, particularly the killer's phone calls to victims, which was a significant plot element in Bob Clark's Black Christmas, released two years later. Related works  Remake and sequel  On December 9, 2011, the website Dread Central announced that a remake of the film would be remade by UK production company North Bank Entertainment as Silent Night, Bloody Night: The Homecoming. The film was released on DVD in the United States by Elite Entertainment in February 2014. On December 29, 2014, New Wave Independent Pictures announced that the production of a sequel to the original film, titled Silent Night, Bloody Night 2: Revival, had begun. The film was released on March 15, 2015. Play adaptation On December 10, 2016, the film was adapted into a play in Brooklyn, New York for a one-night-only production by One And Done Productions.

The Accounting Review was established in 1926. In its early decades, the journal tended to publish articles that would be of interest to accounting practitioners, but over time it shifted towards a preference for quantitative model building and mathematical rigor. In the 1980s the AAA began to publish two other journals, Issues in Accounting Education and Accounting Horizons, that were more relevant to accounting educators and accounting practitioners respectively, to allow The Accounting Review to focus more heavily on quantitative articles.  Overview and history  The Accounting Review is a bimonthly peer-reviewed academic journal covering accounting, and is the flagship journal of the American Accounting Association. Its current Senior Editor is Mary E. Barth (Stanford University). The journal's scope encompasses any accounting-related subject and any research methodology: as of 2010 the proportions of papers accepted for publication across subject areas and research methods was very similar to the proportion of papers received for review. Submissions to The Accounting Review are reviewed by editorial board members and ad hoc reviewers. In 2009, the journal received over 500 new submissions a year, and about 9% of the decision letters sent to authors were acceptances or conditional acceptances. Establishment to 1960s The Accounting Review, launched in 1926 by William Andrew Paton, is one of the oldest academic journals in accounting. The American Association of University Instructors of Accounting, which later became the American Accounting Association, originally proposed that the association publish a Quarterly Journal of Accountics, but the proposal did not see fruition, and The Accounting Review was subsequently born. Paton served as editor and production manager in the journal's first three years. In the first few decades following the journal's establishment, leading authors in The Accounting Review tended to write articles that would be of interest to accounting practitioners. The journal published articles that focused on accounting education and issues related to particular industries and trade groups, with many articles using anecdotal evidence and hypothetical illustrations. The longest-serving editor during this period was Eric Kohler, an accounting practitioner; Kohler served as editor from 1928 to 1942. From the 1940s to the 1960s, The Accounting Review published articles of greater diversity, and leading authors during this period tended to have less practical accounting experience and more formal education. During this period, the three individuals that accounted for most of the editorial duties of the journal were A. C. Littleton (1944‚Äì1947), Frank Smith (1950‚Äì1959) and Robert Mautz (1960‚Äì1962), all of whom either had practical accounting experience, or were leading authors prior to 1945, when the journal was oriented towards the accounting practice. 1960s to present In the 1960s, the journal shifted towards a preference for quantitative model building including econometric models and time series models, and accepted more articles by non-accountants who contributed ideas from other disciplines in solving accounting-related problems. Since the late 1970s, accounting professors have opined that the journal was sacrificing relevance for mathematical rigor, and by 1982, accounting researchers realized that mathematical analysis and empirical research were a necessary condition for articles to be accepted. In the 1980s, the AAA began to publish two other journals, Issues in Accounting Education and Accounting Horizons. Issues in Accounting Education, first published in 1983, was created to better serve accounting educators, while Accounting Horizons, first published in 1987, focused more on issues facing accounting practitioners. This permitted the journal \\"to focus more heavily on quantitative papers that became increasingly difficult for practitioners and many teachers of accounting to comprehend\\". Between the 1980s and the 2000s, with the rise of databases such as Compustat and EDGAR and software such as SAS, articles became mathematically more rigorous with increasingly sophisticated statistical analyses, and accounting practitioners comprised a decreasing proportion of authors in the journal.  Impact  According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal had a 2012 impact factor of 2.319, ranking it 6th out of 89 journals in the category \\"Business, Finance\\". Recent studies on accounting research and on doctoral programs in accounting considered The Accounting Review to be one of six leading accounting journals, and it is also one of the journals used by the Financial Times to compile its business school research rank.

She was later Matron-in-Chief of Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service. Early life and education Roy was born on 24 January 1883, one of eight children of Rev. John Roy, minister of the Church of Scotland at Drymen, Stirlingshire. She was educated at Glasgow High School and at Esdaile, Edinburgh. She trained at the Western Infirmary, Glasgow. Nursing career Roy joining the regular army as a staff nurse in 1909 and was one of a group of 50 British nurses to be sent to France with the British Expeditionary Force one week after the war started. She served in both France and Belgium and was mentioned in despatches. In 1917, she was awarded the Military Medal for conspicuous gallantry, displayed in the performance of her duties on the occasion of hostile air raids on Casualty Clearing Stations in the field. At the end of the war she was awarded the Royal Red Cross, receiving this honour from King George V at Holyrood Palace, Edinburgh, on 5 July 1920. After the war Roy remained in France to nurse victims of the Spanish flu pandemic. During the 1920s Roy received several overseas postings, including Hong Kong, Syria and China. From 1934 she was Principal Matron at the War Office, a senior position with a rank equivalent to that of a lieutenant colonel. On 13 April 1938, Roy was appointed Matron-in-Chief of Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service, the most senior nursing role at the War Office with overall charge of the service, and a position she held until 1940.

Released via Atlantic in March 1980, the album features posthumous vocals by close friend and collaborator Donny Hathaway, who died a year prior after sessions for the album were completed. Overview Intended as her second duets album with Donny Hathaway (following 1972's Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway), Flack's ninth studio album project became a Flack solo album with Hathaway as guest due to Hathaway's death after recording only two songs with her. On 13 January 1979 Hathaway and Flack had recorded the duets \\"Back Together Again\\" and \\"You Are My Heaven\\" - the latter the last song Hathaway would ever record: after having dinner with Flack at her residence in the Dakota, Hathaway had then returned to his suite on the fifteenth floor of Essex House, later fatally falling from window of his suite.

Also both the duets on ...Featuring Donny Hathaway reached the R&B; chart Top Ten peaking at #8, with \\"Back Together Again\\" reaching #3 in the UK: \\"Back Together Again\\" had been written by James Mtume and Reggie Lucas, members of Flack's back-up band who had previously written the 1978 Flack/ Hathaway hit \\"The Closer I Get to You\\", while \\"You Are My Heaven\\" was a Stevie Wonder co-write (with album producer Eric Mercury). Wonder also contributed the song \\"Don't Make Me Wait Too Long\\", providing the track's whispered rap: issued as a third single \\"Don't Make Me Wait...\\" was not a major mainstream hit, but issued on a 12\\" single with \\"Back Together Again\\" afforded Flack her first disco chart hit single with a #6 peak.

As the former chairman and head of the Real Estate Branch of the Talaat Moustafa Group, his net worth was estimated at $800 million in 2007. He was arrested on September 2, 2008 and found guilty on May 21, 2009 for his involvement in the murder of Lebanese singer Suzanne Tamim, but his sentence to death by hanging was overturned on a legal technicality. Following a retrial in 2010, he was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. Moustafa was released after 9 years on June 23, 2017 after receiving a presidential pardon. Background Born in the Egyptian city of Alexandria in 1959, Moustafa graduated in 1980 from the University of Alexandria's College of Commerce with an accounting degree. He is the youngest son of construction magnate Talaat Moustafa and is married with three children (in order of birth): Omar, Tarek, and Mohamed. Murder case On September 2, 2008, Moustafa was charged in Cairo of arranging the murder of Lebanese singer Suzanne Tamim. Moustafa was stripped of his parliamentary immunity. Shares in Talaat Moustafa Group, one of Egypt's biggest real estate developers, fell sharply on the day of his arrest as reports of the indictment reached the stock market. The stock had declined over the summer as rumors of Moustafa's involvement in the murder swirled through Egypt. In November 2008, the presiding judge issued a gag order on the publication of case details other than procedural decisions and the final verdict. On May 21, 2009, Moustafa was found guilty of involvement in the murder through \\"incitement, agreement and assistance.\\" On June 25, he was sentenced to death by hanging, along with former police officer Mohsen al-Sukkari, who was paid $2 million to carry out the hit. Egypt's Grand Mufti Sheikh Ali Goma'a upheld the verdict: \\"The court found no reason to have mercy on the defendants and decided to execute them unanimously.\\" An appeal was filed the day before the August 25 deadline. Retrial On March 4, 2010, the Cassation Court of Egypt accepted an appeal for a new trial after concluding the original verdict had made mistakes of legal technicality. The defense argued that co-defendant Al-Sukkari was not properly represented during his first questioning. Prosecutor Moustafa Khater responded to the finding by stating that Al-Sukkari did not ask for a lawyer. The retrial began on April 26. On May 28, Tamim's family dropped its civil suit against Moustafa and denied that they were paid any money in return. Judge Mahmoud el Khodeiry, former deputy chief of Egypt's appeals court, said this would have no effect on the murder case. On September 25, prosecutors spent two hours delivering final retrial statements, arguing that they had evidence from 39 witnesses and mobile phone messages. Documents presented to the court included records of an attempt by Moustafa to freeze Tamim's bank account in Geneva. On September 28, 2010, the court re-sentenced Moustafa to a reduced penalty of 15 years' imprisonment. Political analysts were surprised that the judgment was issued before final statements were completed. Attorney Gamal Eid of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information stated, \\"They did not even bother to go through the motions to save face. I do not trust that the judiciary is independent, and every day there is new proof of this.\\" Assault investigation In August 2010, Egyptian police opened an investigation of allegations that Moustafa had beaten his brother-in-law Ihab Mohamed Madi during the first week of Ramadan. Madi claimed that the beating began after he tried to intervene in an argument between his wife Sahar and Moustafa. Sahar, who is also Moustafa's sister, has been noted as the only member of Moustafa's family to consistently attend his court hearings. Presidential pardon In June 2017, Moustafa was released after receiving a presidential pardon. His group had just bought 500 acres of land in Cairo's new capital. Philanthropy Al-Shorouk News reported that in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, Moustafa donated 62 million Egyptian Pounds to the Ministry of Health as well, Tahya Misr, and families struggling with the pandemic. This is in addition to 100 million Egyptian Pounds that were donated by TMG's corporate social responsibility group between 2018 and 2019.

It is an exclusively Theravada doctrine that differs from Sarvastivadin and Sautrantika theories of mind, and has been compared to the Mahayana concept of store-consciousness.Waldron, pages 81, 131.L. de La Vall√©e Poussin, Vij√±aptimƒÅtratƒÅsiddhi: La siddhi de HiuanTsang, Paris, 1926, I, 178‚Äì9, 196. Classical definition and development The term does not occur in the Nikayas, though the Theravada tradition identifies it with one that does; the phenomenon described as \\"luminous mind.\\"Harvey1, pages 97-98. The TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma tradition asserts that it is the bhavanga that motivates one to seek nibbana.Wallace, page 100. It is first found in the Patthana, part of the Theravada Abhidhamma Pitaka.Collins, page 238. The word bhava·πÖga is also found in the Nettipakara·πáa, Milindapa√±ha, and Petakopadesa. The nature of bhava·πÖga is also discussed in the Visuddhimagga and AtthasƒÅlinƒ´ of Buddhaghosa, as well as in Buddhadatta‚Äôs AbhidhammƒÅvatƒÅra and Anuruddha‚Äôs Abhidhammatthasa·πÖgaha. According to Rupert Gethin, > \\"bhava·πÖga is the state in which the mind is said to rest when no active > consciousness process is occurring: thus bhava·πÖga is one‚Äôs state of mind > when nothing appears to be going on, such as when one is in a state of deep > dreamless sleep, and also momentarily between each active consciousness > process.\\" Since the bhava·πÖga occurs when there is no active cognitive processes going on, the bhava·πÖga and the forms of manifest cognitive awareness are mutually exclusive according to Waldron: \\"the former ceases when the latter arises.\\"Waldron, 2003, p. 82 Furthermore, Gethin argues that the bhava·πÖga according to Pali Theravada texts is a \\"mental province that defines the essential character and capabilities of a given being\\" which exerts \\"some kind of influence on conscious mental states.\\" In the Visuddhimagga, Buddhaghosa mentions that ‚Äúmental cognition arises dependent on bhavanga-mind, a mental object [dhamma], and attention‚Äù, thus bhavanga is a condition for the arising of cognitive awareness.Waldron, 2003, p. 81 A new being's first moment of bhava·πÖga (called re-linking consciousness) is also directly conditioned by the last full conscious process of the immediately preceding life, a state of bhava·πÖga called ‚Äúfalling away‚Äù or ‚Äúdeath consciousness‚Äù (cuti-citta). Hence, this concept helps provide an account of psychological continuity. Moreover, according to Gethin, this last conscious moment before death \\"operates in principle as a kind of summing up of that life; whatever has been most significant in that life will tend to come before the mind. Moreover, what comes before the mind at this point is what will play the principal role in determining the nature of the subsequent rebirth.\\" L. S. Cousins notes that the bhava·πÖga carries an individual's tendencies: > We may interpret its continuance throughout life as the natural mode to > which the mind continually reverts as indicating its role of ‚Äòcarrying‚Äô the > essential features of the individual ‚Äì those tendencies which remain > apparently unchanged in a particular individual throughout a given life. ‚Ä¶ > Evidently it is seen either as storing past experience or as having direct > access to the past (or future). In the first case we might understand it as > an unconscious storehouse. The mind as a whole is certainly envisaged as > accumulating tendencies, but it is not clear how far this would include > experiences.Cousins, L. S. (1981), ‚ÄúThe Paiihana and the Development of the > Theravadin Abhidhamma,‚Äù Journal of the Pali Text Society, 9: 22‚Äì46, pages > 28-30. Modern interpretations According to Rupert Gethin, modern discussions of bhava·πÖga have tended towards either of two interpretations: \\"they have either tended to see bhava·πÖga as something akin to the contemporary idea of the unconscious; or they have tended to see bhava·πÖga as a kind of mental blank.\\" Theravadins such as Nyanatiloka Thera have departed from traditional descriptions of the bhavanga, broadening the scope of the concept.Waldron, pages 82-87. Nyanatiloka Thera suggests that the bhavanga can be used to explain continuity of the personality in a lifetime, but that the nervous system could also be the register in which sense impressions are stored.Nyantiloka Mahathera, \\"Fundamentals of Buddhism: Four Lectures.\\" . Nyanatiloka sees the bhavanga as a type of unconscious mental process: > ‚ÄúHerein since time immemorial, all impressions and experiences are, as it > were, stored up or, better said, are functioning but concealed as such to > full consciousness from where however they occasionally emerge as > subconscious phenomena and approach the threshold of full > consciousness.‚ÄùNyanatiloka Thera, Buddhist Dictionary, Colombo, Frewin & > Co., 1956, s.v. bhava·πÖga Other scholars like Steven Collins imply that this is a blank state of mind, empty with no content.S. Collins, Selfless Persons, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1982, 238‚Äì47 In the Theravada Abhidhamma, both conceptualizing and mental consciousness normally arise conditioned by other mental states. However, they also have an unspecified kind of r≈´pa (matter, form) as \\"support condition\\" and \\"basis.\\" Peter Harvey finds that incorporating this physical basis more fully may answer certain questions that the Abhidhamma does not address.Harvey2, page 165. One contemporary Theravada teacher claims that bhava·πÖga is an incorrect, and unhelpful interpretation of the Buddha's teaching on dependent origination.Ajahn Brahm, \\"DN15: Mahanidana Sutta - The Great Discourse on Causation (part 2)\\"  Notes   References  * Steven Collins, Selfless Persons; imagery and thought in Theravada Buddhism.

The country's history of association football began with English sailors and their boat trips due to various commercial links between Chile and Great Britain in the 19th century. History Estadio Nacional de Chile (National Stadium of Chile). Football was first brought to Chile by the English that exhibited the sport during visits to the commercial ports such as in Valparaiso. Chileans living in the area would watch how the sport was being played. In 1880 Chilean aristocratic families incorporated the sport into their regular rituals which brought the first games in Chilean football. This occurred within the confines of the British school called Mackay y Sutherland de Cerro Alegre in Valparaiso. Chile's oldest club was founded in the port of Valparaiso, and it was named Valparaiso Football Club.FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup: Destination - Host Country - FIFA.com The governing body of Chilean football Federaci√≥n de F√∫tbol de Chile was established in 1895. Chile was one of the founding members of CONMEBOL which launched the first South American international championship now known as the Copa America. Other important factors that helped the sport of football spread in Chile were the club tours from other nations, such as Argentina and Peru, held in Chile. Furthermore, the first South American tournaments aided in making Chile a better force in the world of association football. By the time the 1930 FIFA World Cup took place in Uruguay, Chile gave a decent performance but was not able to reach the second round due to losing to Argentina and thus getting second place. The next major step in the international arena took place in the 1962 FIFA World Cup which was held in Chile, and a series of interesting stories were built around the victories of the Chilean team that brought the country joy after the terrible earthquake that had deeply hurt the nation. Although Chile did not win, the team was able to obtain 3rd place in the competition. Chile is also one of the only one of two national teams in South America to have reached the final of any major FIFA men's senior competitions other than Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, having finished runners-up in 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/jul/02/chile-v-germany- confederations-cup-final-live?page=with:block-5959369ae4b051f63d23cb06 the other being Venezuela after reaching the final of 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup held earlier. Currently, Chilean football remains a strong force in Latin America.Chile escala y sue√±a Colo-Colo has been the only Chilean club to win a Copa Libertadores championship: the 1991 Copa Libertadores. Also won the Copa Interamericana 1991 and the 1992 Recopa Sudamericana. Other clubs such as Cobreloa, Uni√≥n Espa√±ola and Universidad Cat√≥lica have played finals finishing in 2nd place. And Universidad de Chile has been the only Chilean club to win a Copa Sudamericana championship. On women's football, Chile even earns a greater reputation. Colo-Colo was the first non-Brazilian champion in Copa Libertadores Femenina, having done so in 2012 edition, and has since remained a strong force of women's football in South America. Early Sentiments on Women in Football Women‚Äôs football in Chile is a difficult story to find as the media did not place an emphasis on recording the history of their women footballers and due to the social structure of many Latin American countries, including Chile, at the time, that is unfavorable for women. The media did not believe it was an important topic to cover. The Chilean society in the early 20th century did not believe that women should participate in rough sports and playing football was strongly discouraged. Physical education experts passed along sentiments that women were unequipped physically and mentally. That they did not have the mental aptitude, strength and possessed an overall inferiority to men in the aspects of sporting. Chilean society, like most Latin American societies at this time, believed that women should focus on being mothers rather than playing football. They were fearful that women playing rough sports would allow for a more masculine and homosexual nature to manifest within them making them unattractive in that time. Men who held powerful and influential positions in Chilean society believed that women were supposed to be beautiful, elegant and obedient housewives. However, while many were against them, even some women at times, Chilean women found ways to play football. As time passed, more women‚Äôs teams and players began to spring up with teams stemming from the workplace. National teams The Chile national team represents Chile at all international football competitions. The team is controlled by the Federaci√≥n de F√∫tbol de Chile which was established in 1895. They won Copa Am√©rica in 2015 and 2016. They have also appeared in 9 FIFA World Cup tournaments and were hosts of the 1962 FIFA World Cup finishing in 3rd place. Chile achieved their highest ever ranking in FIFA, standing third, between April and May 2016. A women's team, an under-20 team, and an under-17 team also compete. The Chilean women team qualified for their first ever 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. Chile under-17 football team has written history by becoming the first national team of Chile to play in three consecutive FIFA World Cup, having qualified to the 2019 FIFA U-17 World Cup after hosting the 2015 and qualified to the 2017 editions.

Age was not a prerequisite, but familiarity, through personal experience, with the religious traditions and a spiritual life was. Eldering in the Quaker tradition was commonly thought of as not only teaching, but also correcting behavior. It can only be undertaken by a committee or, on occasion, an individual designated by the committee. Elders are primarily concerned with nurturing the spiritual life of their community and individuals within that group. Spiritual eldering Spiritual Eldering is a term used by the Spiritual Eldering Institute, a multi-faith U.S.-based organization, to denote a focus in later life on spiritual development, interpersonal relationships, communication and service. The Institute is dedicated to the spiritual dimensions of aging and conscious living as expressed in the work of Rabbi Zalman Schlachter-Shalomi. His 1995 book, From Age-ing to Sage-ing (Warner Books), forms the basis of the Institute's teachings. Currently, the Sage-ing Guild, a networking organization formed in 2004, leads discussions, classes and workshops across the U.S. and trains facilitators in Rabbi Schlachter-Shalomi's philosophy. The terms Spiritual Eldering and Sage-ing are used synonymously and are trademarked by the Institute. New Eldering In 2006, The Eldering Institute began using the word \\"Eldering\\" to distinguish \\"wisdom in action\\"‚Äîwith the focus on action. The phrase suggests that if we traffic in our experience and the knowledge we have accrued over the years without being in action or without having the capacity to inspire action in others, then all our \\"wisdom\\" is little more than a pile of comforting and mostly meaningless memories. When we stop the action, we become spectators and begin a process of detachment and inevitable decline. Eldering, in this sense, conveys the idea that life can continuously improve as we get older, provided that we continue to add value (be of service) and that we create and sustain authentic relationships with others of all ages. The action of an elder is eldering and involves most of the elements of effective leadership, including: * Being responsible * Being humble and profoundly acknowledging of others * Being curious about and interested in others * Accepting people and circumstances as they are * Being whole and complete and helping others to be the same * Being committed to possibilities * Creating empowering and trusting relationships with others * Coaching others to accomplish more than they think is possible * Creating results and being wary of self-deception * Listening generously * Thinking rigorously * Enrolling others in the future * Having committed conversations Being an Elder in the twenty-first century is being a human being who is recognized by a community as having some wisdom to offer of continuing value. As such, it is not limited by age, nor is it an entitlement. It is not possible to declare oneself an Elder in the absence of relationships with others in a community. For example, The Elders (or Global Elders), a select group of 12 convened by Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu and Gra√ßa Machel and including Kofi Annan, Jimmy Carter and Mary Robinson (among others), have pledged themselves to act as global Elders to \\"support courage where there is fear, foster agreement where there is conflict, and inspire hope where there is despair\\".

ÂÖâÊòéÂøÉ k≈çmy≈çshin; K. kwangmy≈èngsim) is a Buddhist term which appears in a sutta of the Pali Anguttara Nikaya as well as numerous Mahayana texts and Buddhist tantras.Robert E. Buswell Jr., Donald S. Lopez Jr., The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism, p. 653. It is variously translated as \\"brightly shining mind\\", or \\"mind of clear light\\" while the related term luminosity (Skt. prabhƒÅsvaratƒÅ; Tib. ‡Ω†‡Ωº‡ºã‡Ω¶‡Ω£‡ºã‡Ωñ‡ºã ‚Äôod gsal ba; Ch. guƒÅng m√≠ng; Jpn. k≈çmy≈ç; Kor. kwangmy≈çng) is also translated as \\"clear light\\" in Tibetan Buddhist contexts or, \\"purity\\" in East Asian contexts.Casey Alexandra Kemp, Luminosity, Oxford Bibliographies, LAST MODIFIED: 26 MAY 2016 DOI: 10.1093/OBO/9780195393521-0219 The term is usually used to describe the mind or consciousness in different ways. This term is given no direct doctrinal explanation in the Pali discourses, but later Buddhist schools explained it using various concepts developed by them.Harvey, page 99. The Theravada school identifies the \\"luminous mind\\" with the bhavanga, a concept first proposed in the TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma.Collins, page 238. The later schools of the Mahayana identify it with both the Mahayana concepts of bodhicitta and tathagatagarbha.Harvey, page 99. The notion is of central importance in the philosophy and practice of Dzogchen.  Luminosity in early Buddhist texts  In the Early Buddhist Texts there are various mentions of luminosity or radiance which refer to the development of the mind in meditation. In the Sa·πÖgƒ´ti-sutta for example, it relates to the attainment of samadhi, where the perception of light (ƒÅloka sa√±√±a) leads to a mind endowed with luminescence (sappabhƒÅsa). According to Analayo, the Upakkilesa- sutta and its parallels mention that the presence of defilements \\"results in a loss of whatever inner light or luminescence (obhƒÅsa) had been experienced during meditation\\". The Pali DhƒÅtuvibha·πÖga-sutta uses the metaphor of refining gold to describe equanimity reached through meditation, which is said to be \\"pure, bright, soft, workable, and luminous\\". The Chinese parallel to this text however does not describe equanimity as luminous. Analayo sees this difference due to the propensity of the reciters of the Theravada canon to prefer fire and light imagery. The Pali Anguttara Nikaya (A.I.8-10) states:Harvey, page 94. The reference is at A I, 8-10. > \\"Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is freed from incoming defilements. > The well-instructed disciple of the noble ones discerns that as it actually > is present, which is why I tell you that ‚Äî for the well-instructed disciple > of the noble ones ‚Äî there is development of the mind.\\"Translated by > Thanissaro Bhikkhu, . A parallel passage can be found in the ≈öƒÅriputrƒÅbhidharma, an Abhidharma treatise possibly of the Dharmaguptaka tradition. Another mention of a similar term in the Pali discourses occurs in the Brahmanimanta·πáika-sutta of the Majjhima-nikƒÅya and in the Keva·∏ç·∏çha-sutta of the Dƒ´gha-nikƒÅya, the latter has a parallel in a Dharmaguptaka collection surviving in Chinese translation.AnƒÅlayo, The Luminous Mind in TheravƒÅda and Dharmaguptaka Discourses, Journal for the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies 2017 (13): 10-51. The Brahmanimanta·πáika-sutta describes an ‚Äúinvisible consciousness‚Äù (vi√±√±ƒÅ·πáa·πÉ anidassana·πÉ) that is \\"infinite‚Äù (ananta·πÉ), and ‚Äúluminous in every way‚Äù (sabbato pabha·πÉ). However, there is disagreement among the various editions of the PƒÅli Canon as to whom the statement is spoken by, and in some editions it seems as if it is spoken not by the Buddha but by the deva Baka Brahma in a debate with the Buddha. The Chinese parallel to the Brahmanimanta·πáika-sutta has the term used by Baka Brahma. The Keva·∏ç·∏çha-sutta and its parallel in the Dharmaguptaka Dƒ´rgha-ƒÅgama meanwhile, does have a statement spoken by the Buddha which mentions luminous consciousness. The Dƒ´rgha-ƒÅgama sutra states: > Consciousness that is invisible, Infinite, and luminous of its own: This > ceasing, the four elements cease, Coarse and subtle, pretty and ugly cease. > Herein name-and-form cease. Consciousness ceasing, the remainder [i.e. name- > and-form] also ceases. However, Analayo mentions that parallel recensions of this sutra in other languages such as Sanskrit and Tibetan do not mention luminosity (pabha·πÉ) and even the various Pali editions do not agree that this verse mentions luminosity, sometimes using paha·πÉ (\\"given up\\") instead of pabha·πÉ. Whatever the case, according to Analayo, the passage refers to \\"the cessation mode of dependent arising, according to which name-and-form cease with the cessation of consciousness\\". According to Bhikkhu BrahmƒÅli, the references to luminosity in the Brahmanimanta·πáika-sutta refers to states of samadhi known only to ariyas (noble ones), while the pabhassaracitta of Anguttara Nikaya (A.I.8-10) is a reference to the mind in jhana.Bhikkhu Brahmali, What the NikƒÅyas Say and Do not Say about NibbƒÅna, Buddhist Studies Review. He cites a common passage which notes that the mind with the five hindrances is not considered radiant and thus it makes sense to say that a mind in jhana, which does not have the five hindrances, can be said to be radiant: > So too, bhikkhus, there are these five corruptions of the mind (cittassa), > corrupted by which the mind is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant > (pabhassara·πÉ) but brittle and not rightly concentrated for the destruction > of the taints. What five? Sensual desire ... ill will ... sloth and torpor > ... restlessness and remorse ... doubt is a corruption of the mind, > corrupted by which the mind is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant but > brittle and not rightly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. (SN > V 92 and A III 16, cf. AN I 257 and MN III 243).  In Theravada  The Theravadin Anguttara Nikaya Atthakatha commentary identifies the luminous mind as the bhavanga, the \\"ground of becoming\\" or \\"latent dynamic continuum\\", which is the most fundamental level of mental functioning in the Theravada Abhidhammic scheme.Harvey, page 98. This interpretation is also used by Buddhaghosa, in his commentary on the Dhammasangani. Buddhaghosa also mentions that the mind is made luminous by the fourth jhana in his Visuddhimagga.Skorupski, Tadeusz. ‚ÄúConsciousness and Luminosity in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism.‚Äù In Buddhist Philosophy and Meditation Practice: Academic Papers Presented at the 2nd IABU Conference Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University, Main Campus Wang Noi, Ayutthaya, Thailand, 31 May‚Äì2 June 2012. Thanissaro Bhikkhu holds that the commentaries' identification of the luminous mind with the bhavanga is problematic,Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Pabhassara Sutta: Luminous Note #1. but Peter Harvey finds it to be a plausible interpretation.Harvey, pages 98-99. See also pages 155-179 of Harvey2. Ajahn Mun, the leading figure behind the modern Thai Forest Tradition, comments on this verse: Thanissaro Bhikkhu sees the luminous mind as \\"the mind that the meditator is trying to develop. To perceive its luminosity means understanding that defilements such as greed, aversion, or delusion are not intrinsic to its nature, are not a necessary part of awareness.\\" He associates the term with the simile used to describe the fourth jhana which states: > \\"Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth > so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not > extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright > awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright > awareness.\\"  Other Buddhist schools  According to Tadeusz Skorupski, the Mahasamghika school held that the mind‚Äôs nature (cittasvabhva) is fundamentally pure (mulavisuddha), but it can be contaminated by adventitious defilements. In contrast, the Sarvastivada Vaibhasikas held that the mind was not naturally luminous. According to Skorupski for the Vaibhasikas, the mind: > is initially or originally contaminated by defilements, and must be purified > by abandoning defilements. For them a primordially luminous mind cannot be > contaminated by adventitious defilements. If such a mind were contaminated > by adventitious defilements, then these naturally impure defilements would > become pure once they become associated with the naturally luminous mind. On > the other hand, if adventitious defilements remained to be impure, then a > naturally luminous mind would not become defiled by their presence. For them > the constantly evolving mind is in possession of defilements.  In Mahayana Buddhism  In Sanskrit Mahayana texts and their translations, the term is a compound of the intensifying prefix pra-, the verbal root bhƒÅsa (Tibetan: od) which means light, radiance or luminosity and the modifier vara (Tibetan: gsal ba) which means 'clear,' and also 'the best of, the highest type.'Tony Duff, The Illuminator Tibetan Dictionary Jeffrey Hopkins' Tibetan- Sanskrit dictionary glosses the term compound as: > clear light; clearly luminous; transparently luminous; translucent; brightly > shining; transparent lucidity; splendor; radiance; illumination; spread the > light; lustre; come to hear; effulgence; brilliance.Jeffrey Hopkins, > Tibetan-Sanskrit-English Dictionary Digital version: Digital Archives > Section, Library and Information Center of Dharma Drum Buddhist College > Ê≥ïÈºì‰ΩõÊïôÂ≠∏Èô¢ ÂúñÊõ∏Ë≥áË®äÈ§® Êï∏‰ΩçÂÖ∏ËóèÁµÑ  Mahayana texts  Mahayana sutras generally affirm the pure and luminous nature of the mind, adding that this is its natural condition (prakrti- prabhsvara-citta). In the Pa√±cavimsati Praj√±aparamita sutra, the prabhsvara- citta is interpreted thus: > This mind (citta) is no-mind (acitta), because its natural character is > luminous. What is this state of the mind‚Äôs luminosity (prabhsvarat)? When > the mind is neither associated with nor dissociated from greed, hatred, > delusion, proclivities (anusaya), fetters (samyojana), or false views > (drsti), then this constitutes its luminosity. Does the mind exist as no- > mind? In the state of no-mind (acittat), the states of existence (astit) or > non-existence (nstit) can be neither found nor established... What is this > state of no-mind? The state of no-mind, which is immutable (avikra) and > undifferentiated (avikalpa), constitutes the ultimate reality (dharmat) of > all dharmas. Such is the state of no-mind. A similar teaching appears in some recensions of the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ (8000 lines) Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra. Edward Conze considered the teaching on the \\"essential purity of the nature of mind\\" (prakrti cittasya prabhasvara; xinxiang benjing, ÂøÉÁõ∏Êú¨Ê∑®) to be a central teaching of the Mahayana. However according to Shi Huifeng, this term is not present in the earliest textual witness of the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ, the Daoxing Banruo Jing, attributed to Lokaksema (c. 179 CE).Huifeng Shi, An Annotated English Translation of KumƒÅrajƒ´va‚Äôs Xia≈èpƒ≠n Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra, Asian Literature and Translation Vol. 4, No 1, 2017, 187-236. Mahayana texts like the Ratnagotravibhanga, also associate prabhsvara with awakening (bodhi) and also another term, natural or original purity of mind (cittaprakrtivisuddhi).Robert E. Busswell, 2004, Encyclopedia of Buddhism, page 52. Williams, Paul, Altruism and Reality: Studies in the Philosophy of the Bodhicaryavatara, page 10 In some Mahayana shastras, natural purity is another term for Emptiness, Suchness and Dharmadhatu.Brunnholz, Karl, When the Clouds Part: The Uttaratantra and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Shambhala, 2015, page 1023. Asanga's Mahayanasamgraha for example, states: > The essential purity (prak·πõtivyavadƒÅna), i.e., the true nature (tathatƒÅ), > emptiness (≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ), the utmost point of reality (bh≈´takoti), the signless > (animitta), the absolute (paramƒÅrtha), the fundamental element > (dharmadhƒÅtu).Lamotte, √âtienne , MAHƒÄYƒÄNASA·πÇGRAHA (La Somme du Grand > V√©hicule d'Asa·πÖga), Volume II, page 165. The Bhadrapala-sutra states that the element of consciousness (vij√±anadhatu) is pure and penetrates all things while not being affected by them, like the rays of the sun, even though it may appear defiled.  Alaya-vij√±ana  According to Walpola Rahula, all the elements of the Yogacara store- consciousness (alaya-vijnana) are already found in the Pali Canon.Padmasiri De Silva, Robert Henry Thouless, Buddhist and Freudian Psychology. Third revised edition published by NUS Press, 1992 page 66. He writes that the three layers of the mind (citta, called \\"luminous\\" in the passage discussed above, manas, and vijnana) as presented by Asanga are also used in the Pali Canon.Walpola Rahula, quoted in Padmasiri De Silva, Robert Henry Thouless, Buddhist and Freudian Psychology. Third revised edition published by NUS Press, 1992 page 66, . According to Yogacara teachings, as in early Buddhist teachings regarding the citta, the store-consciousness is not pure, and with the attainment of nirvana comes a level of mental purity that is hitherto unattained.Dan Lusthaus, Buddhist Phenomenology. Routledge, 2002, note 7 on page 154. Svasa·πÉvedana In Tibetan Buddhism, the luminous mind (Tibetan: gsal ba) is often equated with the Yogacara concept of svasa·πÉvedana (reflexive awareness). It is often compared to a lamp in a dark room, which in the act of illuminating objects in the room also illuminates itself.  Tathagatagarbha  In the canonical discourses, when the brightly shining citta is \\"unstained,\\" it is supremely poised for arahantship, and so could be conceived as the \\"womb\\" of the arahant, for which a synonym is tathagata.Harvey, page 96. The discourses do not support seeing the \\"luminous mind\\" as \\"nirvana within\\" which exists prior to liberation.Harvey, pages 94, 96. While the Canon does not support the identification of the \\"luminous mind\\" in its raw state with nirvanic consciousness, passages could be taken to imply that it can be transformed into the latter.Harvey, page 97. He finds the reference at S III, 54, taking into account statements at S II, 13, S II, 4, and S III, 59.Thanissaro Bhikkhu, . Upon the destruction of the fetters, according to one scholar, \\"the shining nibbanic consciousness flashes out of the womb of arahantship, being without object or support, so transcending all limitations.\\"Harvey, page 99. Both the Shurangama Sutra and the Lankavatara Sutra describe the tathagatagarbha (\\"arahant womb\\") as \\"by nature brightly shining and pure,\\" and \\"originally pure,\\" though \\"enveloped in the garments of the skandhas, dhatus and ayatanas and soiled with the dirt of attachment, hatred, delusion and false imagining.\\" It is said to be \\"naturally pure,\\" but it appears impure as it is stained by adventitious defilements.Harvey, pages 96-97. Thus the Lankavatara Sutra identifies the luminous mind of the Canon with the tathagatagarbha.Harvey, page 97. Some Gelug philosophers, in contrast to teachings in the Lankavatara Sutra, maintain that the \\"purity\\" of the tathagatagarbha is not because it is originally or fundamentally pure, but because mental flaws can be removed ‚Äî that is, like anything else, they are not part of an individual's fundamental essence. These thinkers thus refuse to turn epistemological insight about emptiness and Buddha-nature into an essentialist metaphysics.Liberman, page 263. The Shurangama Sutra and the Lankavatara Sutra also equate the tathagatagarbha (and alaya-vijnana) with nirvana, though this is concerned with the actual attainment of nirvana as opposed to nirvana as a timeless phenomenon.Harvey, page 97.Henshall, page 36.  Bodhicitta  The Mahayana interprets the brightly shining citta as bodhicitta, the altruistic \\"spirit of awakening.\\"Harvey, page 97. The Astasahasrika Perfection of Wisdom Sutra describes bodhicitta thus: \\"That citta is no citta since it is by nature brightly shining.\\" This is in accord with Anguttara Nikaya I,10 which goes from a reference to brightly shining citta to saying that even the slightest development of loving-kindness is of great benefit. This implies that loving-kindness - and the related state of compassion - is inherent within the luminous mind as a basis for its further development.Harvey, page 97. The observation that the ground state of consciousness is of the nature of loving-kindness implies that empathy is innate to consciousness and exists prior to the emergence of all active mental processes.Wallace, page 113. Vajrayana Luminosity or clear light (Tibetan od gsal, Sanskrit prabhƒÅsvara), is a central concept in Esoteric Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism and Bon. It is the innate condition of the mind, associated with buddha-nature, the realisation of which is the goal of meditative practice. It is said to be experienced when the coarse and subtle minds dissolve during deep sleep, during orgasm, and during the death process.Buswell, Robert E.; Lopez, Jr., Donald S. (2013).

All systems of Tibetan Buddhism agree that the clear light nature of mind is non-conceptual and free from all mental afflictions, and that tantra is the superior method of working with this nature of the mind.Alexander Berzin, Making Sense of Tantra, 2002 The Indian tantric commentator Indrabhuti, in his J√±anasiddhi, states that > Being luminous by nature, this mind is similar to the moon‚Äôs disc. The lunar > disc epitomises the knowledge (j√±ƒÅna) that is luminous by nature. Just as > the waxing moon gradually emerges in its fullness, in the same way the mind- > jewel (cittaratna), being naturally luminous, also fully emerges in its > perfected state. Just as the moon becomes fully visible, once it is freed > from the accidental obscurities, in the same way the mind-jewel, being pure > by nature (prak·πõti-pari≈õuddha), once separated from the stains of > defilements (kle≈õa), appears as the perfected buddha-qualities (gu·πáa). Luminosity is also a specific term for one of the Six Yogas of Naropa.Tsongkhapa and Mullin, Six Yogas of Naropa, Snow Lion, 1996, pages 81-84. In his commentary, Pema Karpo says that the clear light is experienced briefly by all human beings at the very first moment of death, by advanced yogic practitioners in the highest states of meditation, and unceasingly by all Buddhas.http://explore.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/show/dead/texts/artofdying Various Vajrayana practices involve the recognition of this aspect of mind in different situations, such as dream yoga. In this case, the practitioner trains to lucidly enter the deep sleep state. If one has the ability to remain lucid during deep sleep, one will be able to recognize the luminosity of death and gain Buddhahood. This is called the meeting of mother and child luminosities, resulting in the state of thukdam at death. Dzogchen In Tibetan Buddhist Dzogchen literature, luminosity (od gsal) is associated with an aspect of the Ground termed \\"spontaneous presence\\" (Lhun grub), meaning a presence that is uncreated and not based on anything causally extraneous to itself.Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, 52 This term is often paired with 'original-purity' (ka dag), which is associated with emptiness (shunyata), and are both seen as inseparable aspects of the Ground. Other terms used to describe this aspect are dynamism or creative power (rtsal) and radiance (dwangs).Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, 54.

The NME made their debut single \\"Letting Go\\" its 'Single of the Week', and gave them a place on their New Noise Tour alongside Crystal Castles, Friendly Fires and White Lies. The band signed to Epic Records in August 2008, beating off competition from numerous other record labels, only to be dropped less than 18 months later. The band consisted of Fred Davis on vocals, Nathan Standlee on guitar, Ruggero Lorenzini as DJ, and Lex Dunn on drums. \\"Letting Go\\", the first track written by the band, attracted the attention of Myspace, who made them their featured artist of the week. This exposure resulted in the band getting considerable industry interest before they had even played a gig, with several A&R; representatives attending their debut live show in their native Preston. In February 2008 Team Waterpolo released the track as a single on Moshi Moshi Records, with \\"Problematic Girls\\" as a B-side, which was also included on a compilation released by CatCutter Records later that year. Team Waterpolo have supported Joe Lean and the Jing Jang Jong, Black Kids, The Wombats and Supergrass. Their next single \\"So Called Summer\\" was recorded at the countryside studio used by Alex Turner for his Mercury shortlisted The Last Shadow Puppets, and was released on 27 October 2008. The band did a UK headline tour, which ended in their hometown. The band also undertook another tour, playing venues such as Liverpool Barfly, being supported by Defend Moscow and Sampras. They were the winners of the Steve Lamacq Rebel Playlist in September 2008. In May 2009 they released their new single \\"Room 44\\".

Early life and education Rohrbough was raised in Littleton, Colorado. Rohrbough dropped out of high school at age 16 and later founded a car stereo business in Englewood, Colorado. Career His son, Daniel, was the second murder victim in the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, first being wounded by Eric Harris and then being fatally shot in the back by Dylan Klebold. This event profoundly affected Rohrbough's life. Afterward, he led efforts to examine the sociological reasons for this event, ultimately concluding that a so-called \\"culture of death\\" in the U.S., specifically legalized abortion, and the removal of all vestiges of religion from public school classrooms, were root causes. Since then he has become involved in the anti-abortion movement, and served as president of Colorado Right to Life. Today he is the president of the splinter anti-abortion group American Right to Life. This local Colorado organization is dedicated to prohibiting abortion. He has appeared on numerous local and national television programs across the country.\\"[Brian Rohrbough on CBS News Free Speech\\" 2008 vice presidential campaign In August 2008, America's Independent Party nominated Rohrbough to its first-ever presidential ticket.

Like Keyes, Rohrbough is heavily conservative and believes strongly that ending abortion is of the most importance.

Background Born in Cape Town, Rhode studied Fine Art at Technikon Witwatersrand, now known as the University of Johannesburg, in Johannesburg, South Africa, followed by a postgraduate program at the South African School of Motion Picture Medium and Live Performance (AFDA). He is a multidisciplinary artist who uses a variety of visual languages such as photography, performance, drawing and sculpture to create narratives expressed through materials such as soap, charcoal, chalk and paint. Coming of age in South Africa just after apartheid, Rhode was exposed to new forms of creative expression not motivated by a political or social agenda, but rather the spirit of the individual. The growing influence of hip-hop, film, and popular sports on youth culture as well as the community's reliance on storytelling in the form of colorful murals encouraged the development of Rhode's hybrid street-based aesthetic. Rhode is best known for his photographic series that documents a sole protagonist interacting with murals the artist painted on public walls in Johannesburg and Berlin. In the succession of photographs, the movements of the actor appear to alter the two-dimensional renderings, compressing space and time and transforming the urban landscape into a fictional storyboard. Melding individual expression with broader concerns, Rhode's work utilizes techniques of illusion, a range of historical and contemporary references, and a blending of high and low art forms. Rhode often returns to his native South Africa, creating work in the streets of Johannesburg. It has been said that an outstanding characteristic of his works is his addressing of social concerns in a playful and productive manner, incorporating these issues into his practice without simplifying or judging them.  Artistic practice  Robin Rhode, \\"the candle\\" Reminiscent of practices of street art, Rhode usually works in public spaces, using walls, public basketball courts or just the street as his \\"canvas.\\" His preferred materials are easily accessible ones like charcoal and paint. As a result, his works stand out through their simplicity and their formal clarity, emphasizing the idea over lavishness of production. Rhode transforms simple shapes into elements of narratives, interacting with only imagined presences. This narrative practice goes back to an initiation ritual at South African high schools ‚Äì that Rhode himself experienced ‚Äì where new students are forced to draw and interact with their drawing. Rhode's reference to this event takes this social gesture further into a playful mode of addressing cultural phenomena. Rhode also pays homage to the fervent utopian ideals of the Bauhaus, implicating Oskar Schlemmer's seminal Triadic Ballet from the twenties, a performance experiment created in the Bauhaus studios in the absence of a theatre space, balancing \\"emotional impulses\\" with an agenda of political agitation. His drawings of objects like a bicycle, a motorbike, a car, or of abstract shapes and patterns are employed as physical elements in a story, often alluding to the act of creation itself.  Performances  Rhode's earlier practice was dominated by performances which took place first on the streets, later in museums and galleries. One of the most popular performances is, \\"Car Theft\\" (2003, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN) where Rhode appears as a hooded character in street clothes who first draws a car on the wall and then tries to break in, eventually throwing a stone at the drawn object; highlighting his signature method of attempting to playfully transform flat renderings of everyday objects into illusory three-dimensional ones through his physical interactions. Very much a provocateur and cultural subversive, he shares conceptual links with artists as varied as Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, Jean-Michel Basquiat, David Hammons and the Russian constructivists. Rhode is realising his own personal vision of the world that surrounds him, using art as a means to approach and reflect it in an interdisciplinary practice that goes beyond established borders of genres and traditional ways to engage with art. In Skipping Rope (2005, Mus√©e ƒèArt Moderne de la Ville de Paris/ARC) Rhode interacted with the audience, engaging them into playing with an imaginary rope. The spectators became participants, taking part in Rhode's imagination that continuously seeks to reach beyond the boundaries of traditional artist-spectator roles. In November 2009 Rhode collaborated with Norwegian concert pianist, Leif Ove Andsnes in a reimagining of Modest Mussorgsky's, Pictures at an Exhibition. This collaboration titled, Pictures Reframed features Rhode's stop-frame video animations. Rhode was responsible for the stage design and all visual accompaniments for Andsnes' contemporary exploration of Modest Mussorgsky's piano suite which premiered at the Lincoln Center, New York City.http://magazine.saatchiart.com/articles/artnews/robin_rhode_and_leif_ove_andsn Rhode on Times Square for Erwartung In 2014 Irish rock band U2 invited Rhode to direct a music video for their single, \\"Every Breaking Wave\\". The music video includes some of Rhode's signature stop frame animation stencil drawings with figures interacting with these drawings. In 2015 Robin Rhode was the Artistic Director of the first-ever live production of an opera in Times Square: Arnold Sch√∂nberg's Erwartung ‚Äì A Performance by Robin Rhode; conducted by Arturo Tamayo, and produced in partnership with Performa. The soprano Carole Sidney Louis performed solo on a minimal stage created from printed sketches by Rhode, amidst the sky high buildings and billboards standing in for the dense forest illuminated only by moonlight that the opera is set in. In 2017 FNB JoburgArtFair was delighted to announce Robin Rhode as the 2017 Featured Artist.  Career   Exhibitions  In 2005, Rhode was featured in the 51st Venice Biennale and New Photography at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 2007 he had a large-scale exhibition at the Haus der Kunst in Munich, curated by Stephanie Rosenthal accompanied by his first monograph, \\"Walk Off\\", published by Hatje Cantz. In September 2008 he had solo shows at both the Hayward Gallery and White Cube Gallery, London and participated in Prospect.1 New Orleans, the New Orleans Biennale curated by Dan Cameron. In 2009, Rhode presented a solo exhibition titled, \\"Catch Air\\" at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Ohio. In 2010 Rhode had a solo exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) featuring performances, wall drawings, photographic series, objects, video animations and film. The Castello di Rivoli invited Rhode to exhibit in 2011, resulting in \\"Paries Pictus\\" ‚Äì Rhode's interactive and performative educational project. 'Paries Pictus' is the Latin word for wall drawing. This project invited children to use oversized crayons and to colour-in large scale geometric vinyl graphics applied directly to the walls by the artist. Rhode saw this project as a way of nurturing growth and creativity in youths through visual arts and contemporary art. 2013 saw Rhode's first solo exhibition in Australia, \\"The Call of Walls\\" at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne. This exhibition consisted of two gallery spaces- the first space displaying Rhode's unique blend of fine art, street culture and performance through his photography and animation. The other space incorporating \\"Paries Pictus\\", previously staged in Turin, Italy; New York and Cape Town, South Africa In 2014 Rhode presented a new exhibition titled, \\"Animating the Everyday\\" at the Neuberger Museum of Art in Purchase, New York. This show was a 10-year survey into Rhode's digital videos. 22 works were shown focussing on the digital videos that Rhode classifies as \\"animations\\". It also included photographic series that complemented these time-based works. The in Stockholm, Sweden, invited Rhode to exhibit in 2015. This culminated in The Sudden Walk and included a performance with one of Rhode's long-term collaborators, the dancer, Jean-Baptiste Andr√©, who performed the piece, Light Giver Light Taker at the opening. ‚ÄúUnder the Sun‚Äù, Rhode‚Äôs first Israeli museum exhibition, opened at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 2017.

Generally, the capital allowances will exist for only specified items of tangible capital expenditure, and the expensing is usually spread over a fixed period of years. The term is used in the UK and in Ireland. Unusually, the Irish corporate tax system has a capital allowances for intangible assets scheme which allows intangible assets to be expensed against Irish pre-tax income. It is a key Irish base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) tool that U.S. multinationals use to achieve Irish corporate effective tax rates of <3%, and was used by Apple in Ireland in 2015 (leprechaun economics). Capital allowances are in contrast with depreciation. If capital expenditure does not qualify for a capital allowance, then it means that the business gets no tax relief on such expenditure.  Categories of asset  Capital allowances were introduced in the UK in 1946 and may be claimed for: * plant and machinery * business premises renovation * flat conversion * mineral extraction * research and development * know-how * patents * dredging * assured tenancies Historically, there have also been capital allowances for industrial and agricultural buildings. These have now been phased out, though an allowance may now be claimed for features integral to a building Finance Act 2012.  Plant and machinery  Of these, by far the most important category is plant and machinery. Neither term is defined in legislation, though guidance is given by HMRC This defined machinery as anything that has a moving part. It does not have to be mechanically powered, so a hand-operated device qualifies. The term \\"plant\\" is defined in the court case Yarmouth v France CA 1887, 19 QBD 647 which was not a tax case. This held that plant \\"includes whatever apparatus is used by a businessman for carrying on his business - not his stock in trade, which he buys or makes for sale; but all goods and chattels, fixede or dead, which he keeps for permanent employment in his business\\". In that case, it was held that his employer's horse was plant. The scope of exactly what comes within the scope has been the subject of many cases. Among the more important cases, the following have been held to be plant: * a shoe maker's knife that lasted for two years, but not one that lasted for less than two years Hinton v Maden & Ireland. HL [1959] 38 TC 391. * a large dry dock, which was held to be equipment rather than premises CIR v Barclay Curle & Co Ltd. HL [1969] 45 TC 221 * swimming pools at a caravan park Cooke v Beach Station Caravans Ltd. Ch D [1974] 49 TC 514 * artificial football pitch, held not to be part of the premises CIR v Anchor International Ltd. CS [2004] 77 TC 38 * grain silos Schofield v R & H Hall Ltd. CA(NI) [1974] 49 TC 538 * law books owned by a barrister Munby v Furlong. CA. [1977] 50 TC 491 * gazebo for smokers in the garden of a pub Mrs C A Andrews v HMRC. FTT [2010] TC 799 * decorative screens in the window of building society branches.Leeds Permanent Building Society v Proctor. Ch D [1982] 56 TC 293 Where a capital allowances claim has been made on a property a new purchaser can only make another claim valuing the plant and machinery at the same rate as claimed previously. Further claims can be made on a property where it is extended or re-developed but only on those new elements of plant and machinery introduced to the building. The amount of the allowance depends on what is claimed for. In some cases, the rates are different in the year a business entity made the purchase from those in subsequent years. A business operator cannot claim capital allowances for things bought or sold: these are claimed as business expenses. If a business asset is bought on a hire purchase basis, the original cost of the item can be claimed as a capital allowance, but the interest and other charges count as business expenses.  Types of allowance  The main types of capital allowance are: * annual investment allowance (AIA) introduced from 1 April 2008 Capital Allowances Act 2001 s38A * first year allowance (FYA) * writing down allowance (WDA). * balancing allowance (BA). AIA is claimed for plant and machinery, with some exceptions such as for cars. It is fixed amount regardless of the size of the business and so is worth proportionately more for smaller businesses. The amount has varied many times since its introduction. In the 2015 summer Budget it was announced that it would be fixed at ¬£200,000 until 2020. FYA may be claimed in the tax year in which the asset was acquired.Capital Allowances Act 2001 s52 It has largely been replaced by AIA. It may still be claimed for certain energy-saving products. WDA applies to such amounts of allowable expenditure that are not relieved by either AIA or FYA. Broadly it requires all assets to be put into either a general pool, a special pool or a single-asset pool. Assets in the general pool are written down at 18% while those in the special pool are written down at 8%. An asset in a single-asset pool is written down at either 8% or 18% depending on its nature. The advantage is that, on disposal, the whole of the written down value may be offset against taxable profits. The whole balance of a pool may be written off if it falls below ¬£1,000. BA applies when a business ceases. Technical considerations Capital allowance reliefs can be set against the client's taxable profits reducing the amount payable. Companies pay Corporation Tax at 19% (2018 figureHMRC website https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and- allowances-corporation-tax/rates-and-allowances-corporation-tax), whilst individuals pay tax at 20%, 40% or 45%. Please note as it is an allowance against taxable profit, you have to be a tax payer to benefit, therefore this does not normally apply to property owned in SIPPS or by charities and trusts. Allowances are generated when a business client builds or acquires commercial property. The amount of plant contained within the building or acquired property is the key to maximising the relief. The claim should be considered as an effective discount and cash contribution to the construction cost or purchase price. The claim provides a tax saving that accrues over time. It is possible to claim allowances on investment properties but plant let in a \\"dwelling house\\" is excluded. Blocks of flats, halls of residence etc. will therefore qualify. For property that is being acquired, the specialist can apportion the purchase price under a recognised HMRC formula, and this is where the inherent property skill can maximise the claim with optimal costing of the plant contained within the property See also * Amortization (tax law) * Depreciation * Capital allowances for intangible assets (Irish) References External links * HM Revenue & Customs * Capital Allowances - A small business guide * Enhanced Capital Allowance (ECA) Scheme Taxation in the United Kingdom Accounting in the United Kingdom ","title":"Capital allowance"},{"id":"19153003","text":"Capitalizing on Roberta Flack's comeback success with the hit duet, \\"Tonight I Celebrate My Love,\\" K-tel Records released Greatest Hits in 1984.

After the conflict he served as a staff officer in the Egyptian Army. Early life and career Reynolds as a United States Army captain Alexander W. Reynolds was born in either 1816 or 1817 in Frederick County, Virginia. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1833, and graduated five years later, standing 35th out of 45 cadets.Reynolds West Point Biography # 975 Vol 1 p.566 only goes up to Reynolds dismissal from the army in 1861 He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Infantry on July 1, 1838. Reynolds was promoted to first lieutenant on June 11, 1839, and was the 1st's Regimental Adjutant from October 19 to March 1, 1840.Eicher, Civil War High Commands, p. 450. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Reynolds was a captain in the U.S. Army, serving as the Army's assistant Quartermaster beginning August 4, 1847. He was at this rank on March 15, 1848, when he vacated his line commission. Reynolds was dismissed from the U.S. Army on October 8, 1855, following the disappearance of US$126,307 from Reynolds' office in Santa Fe, where he was stationed. At the time of his dismissal he held multiple quartermaster positions, through which he was engaging in double billing, over billing and theft of government funds. Reynolds also owned full or partial interest in two sawmills, two gold mines, four ranches, two homes, three hotels and multiple town lots. However, three years later, with help from his political connections, he had himself restored to the service at his previous rank of captain as of March 29, 1858.Wooster, \\"The American Military Frontier\\", p. 123. Civil War service During the American Civil War, Reynolds chose to follow his home state and the Confederate cause. He went AWOL from the U.S. Army while serving in TexasEicher, Civil War High Commands, p. 450; Warner, Generals in Gray, 1959, p. 254. Reynolds would be \\"dropped\\" from U.S. Army rolls on October 4, 1861, because he \\"absented himself from duty\\". and entered the Confederate States Army in 1861. He was appointed a captain in the Confederate Infantry on March 16, 1861, and promoted to colonel of the 50th Virginia Infantry on July 10, 1861.Warner, Generals in Gray, p. 255. His soldiers called him \\"Old Gauley.\\"Hesseltine & Wolf, Blue and the Gray on the Nile, p. 72. Reynolds first served under Brigadier General John B. Floyd in western Virginia. In March 1862, Reynolds was sent to the Western Theater. He joined Edmund Kirby Smith's command in the Army of Kentucky throughout the rest of 1861 and most of 1862. After the Kentucky Campaign failed in its object, Smith's army joined General Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee in a reorganization of Confederate forces in the Western Theater. On December 16, 1862, Confederate President Jefferson Davis ordered the transfer of Major General Carter L. Stevenson's division to Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton's army. Reynolds utilized the political connections of his brother- in-law, Virginia Delegate Mason Mathews, to lobby for his promotion to general officer with Secretary of War James Seddon.Combs, James Thurl (1987). \\"Greenbrier, C.S.A. Wartime Letters of Mason Mathews to his son Captain Joseph William Mathews, C.S.A.\\" The Journal of the Greenbrier Historical Society (Parsons, West Virginia: Greenbrier Historical Society) V (1): 5-44. General Reynolds, commanding a brigade in Stevenson's division, went with his troops to Vicksburg.Cozzens, Battle of Stones River, p. 38. Vicksburg Unlike the other three brigades of Stevenson's division, Reynolds' brigade suffered only lightly at the Battle of Champion's Hill. During the Siege of Vicksburg his brigade held a portion of the southernmost sector near the \\"Salient Work\\".\\"Civil War Times\\", pp. 40-41. His brigade lost 14 killed, 25 wounded, and 14 missing during the siege.Battles & Leaders III, p. 549. Reynolds' brigade was part of the garrison that surrendered on July 4, 1863. Reynolds was taken prisoner. Chattanooga Reynolds was exchanged on October 13, 1863, and promoted to brigadier general to rank from September 14, 1863.Wright, General Officers, p. 111. Appointed from Virginia on September 17, 1863, to rank from September 14, and confirmed by Confederate Congress on February 17, 1864. Reynolds led a brigade in Maj. Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner's division during the Chattanooga Campaign. After Confederate President Davis ordered Lt. Gen. James Longstreet to recapture Knoxville, Tennessee, Buckner's division was sent as a reinforcement. When the Union army attacked Bragg on 23 November, Reynolds' brigade was still waiting to board the trains that would take them to Knoxville. Detached from its parent division, Bragg sent it into the fight.Cozzens, Battles for Chattanooga, p. 137. 1863's Battle of Missionary Ridge. Reynold's force is near the center of the map. In the Battle of Missionary Ridge, Bragg and corps commander John C. Breckinridge probably committed a serious tactical blunder in placing the troops of Reynolds and other brigades in a first line of breastworks at the base of the ridge. In case of a Federal attack, the two generals intended for Reynolds' men to fire a single volley and fall back to a position on the crest where a gap was deliberately left.Cozzens, Battles for Chattanooga, p. 255. To compound the error, Bragg ordered Reynolds to move his brigade back to the top of the ridge early in the afternoon. Coincidentally, his men began pulling back just as the main Union attack began. This encouraged the attacking Federals and demoralized nearby Confederate troops in the first line.Cozzens, Battles for Chattanooga, pp. 268-69. Reynolds' troops were winded by the time they reached their empty position on the crest. When Union soldiers broke through the next brigade to the north, his exhausted men put up a brief resistance before retreating.Cozzens, Battles for Chattanooga, p. 289. Atlanta Reynolds continued in brigade command in the Army of Tennessee during the Atlanta Campaign of 1864. He served in Stevenson's division of Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood's Corps.Battles & Leaders IV, p. 291. He fought at the battles of Rocky Face Ridge, Resaca, and Adairsville before being wounded in the Battle of New Hope Church on May 27. Upon recovery from his wounds, Reynolds was appointed assistant Inspector General of the District of Georgia in 1865 until the end of the war. He was paroled at Athens, Georgia, on May 8. Postbellum Reynolds entered the service of Egypt in 1869 as a colonel in the Egyptian Army. Egyptian chief of staff, Charles Pomeroy Stone assigned Reynolds to serve as Quartermaster, Commissary officer, and paymaster general.Hesseltine & Wolf, Blue and the Gray on the Nile, p. 80. He and his wife (whom he referred to as duchess), and his son Frank, and Frank's wife and son took up residence in Alexandria, Egypt. They became friends with a small circle of American expatriates that included Stone, William W. Loring, and Raleigh E. Colston.Hesseltine & Wolf, Blue and the Gray on the Nile, p. 75. Tragedy struck the Reynolds family in 1875. The previous year Frank Reynolds had returned to the United States with his wife and son to buy Remington rifles for the Egyptian government. In 1875, Frank became sick and died in Ilion, New York. After this, Mrs. Reynolds returned to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she soon died. At this time, Reynolds lost his support group of expatriates when most of the American officers left for the war against Ethiopia. With his pay from the Egyptian government in arrears and owing his creditors money, he was forced to move into a seedy boarding house. He died in bed there on May 26, 1876. According to gossip, alcoholism was a contributing factor.Hesseltine & Wolf, Blue and the Gray on the Nile, p. 217. The exact whereabouts of Alexander W. Reynolds's remains are not known;Obituaries in five 1876 newspapers report Reynolds passing but make no mention of his burial place they could be in an unmarked grave in Alexandria or in the Patton Tomb located in Lewisburg, West Virginia, at the Old Stone Presbyterian Churchyard. In Reynolds's memory a cenotaph was erected in St. James the Less Cemetery located in Philadelphia.

Shorter is convinced that one particular scene in a movie he recently saw was too realistic to have been staged with fake blood, but when Pascoe starts investigating, he soon comes across the actress in question, Linda Abbott, who obviously didn't suffer from any harm and assures Pascoe that his and Shorter's concerns are unnecessary.

The only existing copy of \\"Droit de Seigneur\\" - the film Jack Shorter was so worried about - has been destroyed, and when 13-year-old Sandra Burkill accuses the dentist of being the father of her (yet unborn) child, it begins to look as if Shorter had merely tried to avert suspicions by his claims against the \\"Calli\\".

It was a basketball powerhouse, producing several NBA players including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Len Elmore, Mario Elie, Chris Mullin, as well as NBA referee Dick Bavetta and a record 71-game winning streak. Its 1964 basketball team was named \\"The #1 High School Team of The Century\\". History Founding In 1906, Monsignor James W. Power, pastor of All Saints Parish in Harlem, asked the Christian Brothers of Ireland (now the Congregation of Christian Brothers) to come to the United States and open a school to teach the boys of the largely Irish immigrant parish. The Brothers accepted the invitation and began to teach in the parochial school. In 1909 they also opened the All Hallows Collegiate Institute, located in four rowhouses at 15 West 124th Street, which was both a high school and a business college.Remigius Lafort, S.T.D., Censor, The Catholic Church in the United States of America: Undertaken to Celebrate the Golden Jubilee of His Holiness, Pope Pius X. Volume 3: The Province of Baltimore and the Province of New York, Section 1: Comprising the Archdiocese of New York and the Diocese of Brooklyn, Buffalo and Ogdensburg Together with some Supplementary Articles on Religious Communities of Women.. (New York City: The Catholic Editing Company, 1914), p. 309. Enrollment grew and a new building was acquired to accommodate a larger student body at 164th Street and Walton Avenue in the Bronx, to which the high school moved in 1929. At the request of the Archdiocese of New York, the Christian Brothers re-occupied the former site of All Hallows and opened a new school, named Power Memorial Academy after Monsignor Power, who had died in 1926. The new school opened with an enrollment of 31 freshmen on September 21, 1931. Again the school grew, requiring more space. In 1938, the Brothers purchased the former New York Nursery & Child's Hospital at 161 West 61st Street and opened a new school there. The school remained at this address until it closed. A student murdered On March 15, 1948, Marko L. Markovich opened fire on students practicing for the St. Patrick's Day parade, killing one, Thomas Brady, and wounding six others. \\"Mad gunman kills boy here, wounds six before capture\\" read the front-page headline on the New York Times. In memoriam, the academy marched in the parade without music, their flags and drums wrapped in black. The parade was attended by President Harry S. Truman and Governor Thomas E. Dewey. Closing By the early 1980s, the school building was judged to have deteriorated to such an extent that the Brothers were unable to afford the necessary repairs. In June 1984, Power Memorial Academy closed. The property was sold the following year for $13 million.New York Sunday News article by Bill Reel, January 13, 1985 The building was demolished and a luxury apartment building was built on the site. Athletics Basketball powerhouse Power Memorial started a basketball program in the late 1930s, winning All-City championships in 1937 and 1941; and the Metropolitan Championship in 1942. Over its history, it won a total of eight New York City Catholic High School Athletic Association (CHSAA) championships. In 1961 freshman Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul- Jabbar) joined the basketball team. Alcindor led the team to 27 consecutive victories and the 1963 CHSAA championship. The winning streak continued as the team went undefeated and won the CHSAA in 1964. The streak finally ended at 71 games on January 30, 1965 when DeMatha High School of Hyattsville, Maryland defeated Power, 46-43. That was one of only 6 losses in Alcindor's high school career (96‚Äì6). The 1963-64 team was named \\"The #1 High School Team of The Century\\" by National Sports Writers John (Jack) Cunningham, Author and Founder of CAProductions and was inducted into the CHSAA Hall of Fame as the team of the century. Power Memorial continued to be known as a basketball powerhouse, although it never repeated the total dominance of the early 1960s. All- Americans Len Elmore, Ed Searcy and Jap Trimble were on the 1970 team that won the CHSAA and was named \\"Number 1 Team in the Country\\". Mario Elie played and Chris Mullin also played at Power in the late 1970s, although Mullin later transferred to Xaverian High School.

Description  This species is a typical member of the genus. Both genders typically have pale yellow wings above with no traces of orange, unlike its close cousin the orange sulphur which may also be yellowish. Males have clean borders, while females have yellow dots within this region. Females sometimes exhibit a white form known as alba. The underside of the male's wings is yellow while the female's is yellow or greenish white, and both have a doubled hindwing spot trimmed in brownish red. The hindwings show a series of four small red spots along the outer third portion, a trait that distinguishes the other North America species such as Colias interior, with exception of the orange sulphur which also shows them. Its wingspan is 32 to 54 mm.http://www.cbif.gc.ca/spp_pages/butterflies/species/CloudedSulphur_e.php White form female ; Form alba This species has white form alba which can be very common in some populations, while rare in others. It can be confused with other white forms of Colias particularly that of Colias eurytheme. It can often be distinguished by the border pattern of both wings, though some individuals are impossible to separate without the presence of other \\"normal\\" specimens. Though they differ in flight style, the white forms of Colias may be confused with other pierids such as Pieris rapae and Pontia protodice.http://bugguide.net/node/view/12864 White form males are also known, but they are exceedingly rare in this species.http://bugguide.net/node/view/503074  Habitat  This butterfly may be encountered in fields, lawns, alfalfa or clover fields, meadows, and roadsides.

The activities of the Prostheses Foundation, which he founded in 1992 under royal sponsorship from the Princess Mother Srinagarindra, have expanded beyond the borders of Thailand to Malaysia, Laos, and Burma. Jivacate has established Thailand's first and only educational institution of occupational therapy at Chiang Mai University. He has also created an educational programme for children suffering from chronic diseases at Maharaj Hospital in Nakhon Ratchasima. In 2008, he was given the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service. In addition to his work with humans, Dr Jivacate has also designed prosthetic limbs for elephants who have been injured by landmines.  Early life  Therdchai Jivacate graduated from the Faculty of Medicine of Chulalongkorn University in 1965. From 1968 to 1972 he was a resident of physical medicine and rehabilitation in Northwestern University, while from 1972 to 1975 he specialized in orthopedic surgery at Chiang Mai University. One of his first technological discoveries involved manufacturing artificial legs from recycled plastic yogurt bottles. Jivacate used his own funds to simplify and adapt the process and the devices to meet local needs‚Äîfor instance, designing artificial legs specifically for use by farmers working in wet fields.  Prostheses Foundation  On August 17, 1992 under sponsorship from the Princess Mother Srinagarindra he founded the Prostheses Foundation headquartered in Chiang Mai becoming its secretary- general. With further support from private donors, the royal family, and the Thai national lottery fund, the organization's activities were expanded. The Prostheses Foundation has manufactured artificial legs for more than 15,000 people, for free.  Innovations  After observing that amputees living in the remote borderlands of Thailand were among the least likely to obtain proper prosthetic limbs, Jivacate formed field clinics‚Äîthat is, organized teams of specialized personnel and volunteers who manufacture prosthetic limbs in mobile workshops. The process is completed within six days; every day 150 to 300 people acquire new prosthetic limbs. Since 1992, Jivacate has organized nearly 100 mobile workshop missions including missions in Laos, Malaysia and Myanmar, the workshops of some of which eventually became permanent satellite ones. These workshops are equipped, and their technicians (many of whom are also amputees) are trained, by the Prostheses Foundation. These activities have also been expanded in Aceh, Indonesia. As of 2010, the mobile units have provided service to about fourteen thousand patients, made seventeen thousand new prosthetic legs, and repaired two thousand artificial legs. In 2009 Jivacate used a modified version of the Centre for Rehabilitation casting system to fabricate a prosthetic leg for Baby Mosha, a female elephant whose leg had been amputated after she had stepped on a landmine in 2006, when she was 7 months old. The process was featured in a documentary film titled The Eyes of Thailand directed by Windy Borman.  Awards  In 1993, one year after the establishment of the Prostheses Foundation, Dr Jivacate won the Thararom Quality Award for creative inventions from discarded materials, and was voted best rural doctor by the National Medical Association of Thailand. In 1994, the National Research Council of Thailand awarded him the third prize for the most useful medical invention. On August 31, 2008 he was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund as a recognition of his work on developing artificial limbs available even for poor people.

Sugar packets are commonly supplied in restaurants, coffeehouses, and tea houses, where they are preferred to sugar bowls or sugar dispensers for reasons of neatness, sanitation, spill control, and to some extent portion control. Statistics A typical sugar packet in the United States contains 2 to 4 grams of sugar. Some sugar packets in countries such as Poland contain 5 to 10 grams of sugar. Sugar packet sizes, shapes, and weights differ by brand, region, and other factors. Because a gram of any carbohydrate contains 4 nutritional calories (also referred to as \\"food calories\\" or kilo- calories), a typical four gram sugar packet has 16 nutritional calories. The amount of sugar substitute in a packet generally differs from the volume and weight of sugar in a packet. Packets of sugar substitutes typically contain an amount of sweetener that provides an amount of sweetness comparable to a packet containing sugar. Packets are often colored to provide simple identification of the type of sweetener in the pack. History The sugar cube was used in restaurants until it began to be replaced directly after World War II. At this time, machines were made that could produce small packets of sugar for nearly half the cost. The sugar packet was invented by Benjamin Eisenstadt, the founder of Cumberland Packing best known as the manufacturer, distributor and marketer of Sweet 'N Low. Eisenstadt had been a tea bag factory worker, and became irritated by the task of refilling and unclogging all the sugar dispensers in his Brooklyn cafeteria across from the Brooklyn Navy Yard. He did not patent the idea and lost market share after discussions with larger sugar companies. Collecting The hobby of collecting sugar packets is called sucrology. Collectors can, for example, focus on the variety of types of sugar or brand names. Sugar packets are also handy forms of advertisement for businesses.

The central point is that the mainstream perception of the \\"enemies of reason\\"http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/E/enemies_of_reason/ distracts attention from the real threat of corporate and government corruption of Enlightenment principles.

He currently works as a freelance, internationally as a theatre director and most recently as a director of BBC Radio 4 drama. Early years William Alexander Paterson was born in Hunstanton, Norfolk, England, on 23 February 1948 to William and Rosemary Paterson (n√©e McCormack). He was a boarder at St. Lawrence College, Ramsgate, Kent before going on to Keele University (1969‚Äì1973) where he studied English and founded an experimental theatre group called Guerilla Theatre based on the principles of the Polish theatre director Jerzy Grotowski. Early career In 1974, Alexander began his career as a Trainee Director at the Bristol Old Vic. His productions included Butley by Simon Gray, How the Other Half Loves by Alan Ayckbourn, Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Blythe Spirit by No√´l Coward. In 1975 he joined the Royal Court Theatre as an assistant director. His production of Class Enemy by Nigel Williams won the Binkie Beaumont Award for Best New Director. At the Royal Shakespeare Company Alexander joined the RSC in 1977 as assistant to Trevor Nunn and John Barton. Initially, he worked in the RSC's two studio theatres: The Warehouse in London (primarily devoted to new plays) and The Other Place in Stratford (dedicated to a mixture of new plays and the re-discovery of classics by performing them on a small scale). He also worked at The Pit studio space which replaced The Warehouse when the RSC moved to the Barbican. In 14 years at the RSC, Alexander's studio productions included Factory Birds by James Robson (Warehouse), Captain Swing by Peter Whelan (TOP), Tartuffe by Moli√®re (PIT), Volpone by Ben Jonson (TOP and PIT), The Accrington Pals by Peter Whelan (Warehouse), Cymbeline by William Shakespeare (TOP and PIT) with Harriet Walter as Imogen. Alexander's first production on the RSC main stage was Richard III (with Antony Sher as Richard) in 1984. This production, for which Anthony Sher won the Olivier Award for Best Actor later transferred to the Barbican. In 1980 he directed Harold Pinter's Betrayal at the Cameri Theatre, Tel Aviv. In 1986, Alexander's production of The Merry Wives of Windsor won him the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Director. In 2014, Michael Billington, the Guardian's theatre critic chose this production as one of his 'Best'. Alexander's other productions for the RSC included A Midsummer Nights Dream (1986) with Sean Bean as Robin Starveling, Twelfth Night with Harriet Walter as Viola, and Deborah Findlay as Olivia 1987/88,The Merchant of Venice with Antony Sher as Shylock in 1987, Cymbeline with David Bradley and Harriet Walter in 1998, Much Ado About Nothing in 1991, The Taming of the Shrew in 1992, and Titus Andronicus in 2003. About the latter Alexander said,\\"I've also discovered what I like about Titus: it's the best play about revenge that I can think of. Revenge is such a difficult idea to deal with. Everyone knows it's \\"a bad thing\\", yet everyone understands the phrase \\"revenge is sweet\\". Titus shows revenge's seductiveness, the impulse in us all that the law is there to control. It is a work of lurid genius because it reminds us of the fundamental truths about the role of law in a just society.\\" Birmingham Repertory Theatre Alexander left the RSC to become Artistic Director and Chief Executive of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in 1992.

In his own time, his name was transcribed as either V.K. Ting, or Ting Wen-chiang. Biography Early life Ding was born into a wealthy family in Taixing, Jiangsu Province. He went to study in Japan in 1902, and later studied in Britain, majoring in zoology and geology. In 1911, Ding graduated from the University of Glasgow. After returning to China, he taught at Nanyang Public School (now Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in Shanghai. In 1913, Ding became the geological section chief in the Mining Administrative Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and went to Shanxi and Yunnan, conducting geological and mineral exploitation. National Geological Survey Together with Wong Wen-hao (Weng Wenhao in pinyin), Ding was also the founder of China's new National Geological Survey, where he collaborated closely with foreign scholars such as Johan Gunnar Andersson in training the first generation of Chinese geologists (Fiskesj√∂ and Chen 2004; Fiskesj√∂ 2011, Shen 2014). In 1921, Ding became the general manager of the Beipiao Mining Company, and founded the Chinese Geological Society. He served as vice president of the society, and was the editor-in-chief of \\"Chinese Palaeobiology\\". In 1923, Ding published a paper, \\"Mythology and Science\\", arguing with Zhang Junmai over science and philosophy, fighting against the view that \\"science is irrelevant to human philosophy\\" (on the major debates of which this was a part, see Furth 1970). Director In 1925, Ding was appointed as the director of Shanghai Commercial Bureau. He represented Jiangsu provincial government to negotiate with foreign delegates to Shanghai. They signed \\"The Temporary Regulation on Reclamation of Juridical Rights in Shanghai by China\\" on August 1, 1926. In 1931, Ding became a professor of geology at Peking University. Together with Weng Wenhao and Zeng Shiying, he edited and published \\"New Geographic Map of the Republic of China\\", and \\"Provincial Maps of China\\". In June, 1934, Ding served as the chief staff of Academia Sinica. When he was exploring a coal mine in Hunan in 1936, he was poisoned by coal gas. Fu Sinian came from Beijing to take care of him. On January 5, Ding died in Xiangya Hospital in Changsha. Following his will, he was buried on Yuelu Mountain. Author Ding authored The Textbook of Zoology. His geological exploitation materials were compiled into Mr. Ding Wenjiang's Geological Investigation Report, and published in 1947. Ding was also the first Chinese scholar to systematically study the written words of Yi ethnicity (see Fiskesj√∂ 2011). Hu Shih wrote Biography of Ding Wenjiang, and commented that he is \\"a most Europeanized Chinese, and a most scientifically styled Chinese.\\" (Hu Shih: Ding Wenjiang). At the time of his death, he was working on a comprehensive book on the archaeology of ancient China.  References  * Furth, Charlotte. Ting Wen- chiang: Science and China's New Culture.

Through his entire life, he fought against the growing strength of the United States and tried to stop the flow of settlers into the Old Northwest. He joined with Tecumseh to push the settlers south and east of the Ohio River and followed him to defeat in Canada during the War of 1812. Early years With the Treaty of Greenville (July 1795) peace returned east of the Mississippi River. In Spanish-controlled St. Louis, however, officials had urged the various Indian groups to wage war upon the Osage in 1793. The Potawatomi had been among those to accept the offer, but though incidents of violence did take place, the Lieutenant-Governor of Spanish Illinois summed up the lackluster efforts of his various allies by stating that they \\"merely pretend to make effective their promises, while even showing the willingness to make peace, in order to frighten us and to attract immense presents...\\" By the turn of the century the few notable, trans-Mississippi raids that did take place were attributed to only two particular Potawatomi leaders: Turkey Foot of the Tippecanoe and Main Poc of the Kankakee. White settlers in eastern Missouri and southern Illinois were particularly incensed by these forays as raiding parties often pilfered horses and livestock as well as killed a number of homesteaders and travelers .Edmunds, R. David; The Potawatomis, Keepers of the Fire, 1978 By 1805, Main Poc had become the sole documented leader of such forays. In the autumn of that year, the United States brokered a treaty with the Osage, promising to protect them from such incursions. Less than a month later, Main Poc carried out his most audacious raid yet, capturing over sixty Osage prisoners. Responding to Osage pressure, the United States did its best to purchase and recover as many of the captives as possible, most of whom had been sold to the Sauk and Mesquakies along the Mississippi in northwestern Illinois. Following the raid, Main Poc's influence in the region greatly increased. Both village chiefs and U.S. officials alike courted him in an attempt to further their own political ends. Able to support his followers upon their largess, Main Poc refrained from raiding for almost five years. With Tecumseh When Tecumseh and his brother the Prophet sent messengers among the Potawatomi in 1807, Main Poc readily gave support. While his given name was Wenebeset (\\"Crafty One\\"), he was known as \\"Main Poc\\", meaning \\"Withered Hand\\" in French. He had a crippled left hand. All the fingers and thumb were missing. He had risen as a shaman and had visions and contact with the spirits. The fall of 1808 found Main Poc visiting the Shawnee Prophet at his village on the Auglaize River in Ohio. He went in November and spent two months among the Shawnees. Main Poc spent the winter at Fort Wayne, where he had been invited by the Indian Agent to winter. While the Americans saw this as a sign of loyalty by the Potawatomi chief, Main Poc continued to declare his independence from American demands. When Main Poc returned to his village on the Kankakee and again prepared for war against the Osage, the American Agents proposed to send Main Poc and a delegation to Washington, D.C. He was in Washington by December and met with President Thomas Jefferson. He returned home in the spring of 1809. With the depletion of the food stocks at Prophetstown, which the prophet had moved to the previous summer, the Potawatomi warriors were returning to their own villages. Main Poc did likewise and spent a quiet spring on the Kankakee. The following year (1810), Prophetstown was again growing and Main Poc moved there in June. The combined Indian nations were planning their attacks against the American posts. Main Poc was to lead a force of Potawatomi against Fort Dearborn (Chicago). In July 1810, a series of Potawatomi raids against the Osage increased the tension between the Americans and the Potawatomi. When Gomo of the Lake Peoria Potawatomi went to St. Louis in September to profess friendship with the Americans and to promise to restrain the Illinois Potawatomi warriors. Main Poc had spent the summer in western Illinois raiding the scattered settlements and in November led a raid against the Osage. During the raid, Main Poc was wounded and could not walk or ride. He was ferried down the Missouri and up the Mississippi to a village near Portage des Sioux, where he spent the winter of 1810-11. In April, the recovered Main Poc moved his village to Crow Prairie at the northern end of Lake Peoria. From this new village, Main Poc led raids against the American settlements and skirmished with the militia units. A delegation was sent to the Peoria villages of Gomo in an attempt to end the raids. Main Poc did not attend and the Peoria villages had not joined with Main Poc's warriors in the raids. The expedition returned south without gaining a cessation to the attacks. Instead, Main Poc journeyed north to the Rock River Sauk and then to the Kickapoo villages on the Kankakee. Obtaining their allegiance, Main Poc traveled to the British post at Amherstburg (across from Detroit) to spend the winter of 1811 in Canada. Harrison marched on Tippecanoe during August 1812 in an attempt to end the raids on the Illinois frontier. His victory ended the Indian Confederacy. But, Main Poc remained in Canada, sending Wabameme to the Potawatomi villages around Lake Michigan preparing them for war. In March 1812, an American delegation traveled the Illinois River inviting the Potawatomi to Cahokia for a council of peace. The council achieved little as the chiefs hostile to the Americans, like Main Poc did not attend. By July, word was received among the warriors following Tecumseh that Main Poc was returning from the British with kegs of powder. Plans went forward for the destruction of Fort Dearborn. By this time, Main Poc was considered by the American military as second only to Tecumseh in influence among the pro-British warriors. Main Poc spent the summer on southern Lake Michigan, but his influence was felt as his messengers continued to counsel war among the Potawatomi villages. Main Poc and Shabbona were in Canada at the siege of Detroit, while Blackbird and Mad Sturgeon lead the attack (August 15, 1812) on Fort Dearborn (Chicago). On August 5, the Potawatomi led by Tecumseh turned back the American's at the Battle of Brownstown. Four days later, Caldwell and Main Poc at Monguaga ambushed another column sent to relieve Detroit. Many Potawatomi joined with Tecumseh in support of the British as they retreated from Detroit into the southern Canada. They were defeated at the Battle of the Thames (October 5, 1813). Main Poc had remained near Detroit, planning to attack Governor Harrison's supply columns. When the American Brigadier General Duncan McArthur, stationed to protect Detroit and the supply route, extended a truce to the nations of the lower lakes. Harrison at first refused to let the Potawatomi join. He relented to insure peace on the frontier and Topinbee, Five Medals and Main Poc signed for the Potawatomi. American domination The summer of 1814 witnessed the Treaty of Greenville, where the pro-American chiefs of the Potawatomi attended. Main Poc and the other pro-British chiefs (Moran, Mad Sturgeon, and Chebass) stayed away. Main Poc moved to a new village on the Yellow River (between Knox and Plymouth). From here, raids were made against Fort Harrison (Terre Haute). McArthur was instructed in August 1814 to raise a militia force and deal with the Potawatomi. Unable to raise a large enough force, no action was taken. In 1815, the news arrived that the Treaty of Ghent had ended the conflict between the Americans and the British. Main Poc was at Mackinac when the British commander notified the Indian allies of the peace treaty. When invited to Spring Wells (near Detroit), to sit in a council of peace, Main Poc refused to attend. As peace came to the frontier, the mixed-blood tribal members were taking on leadership roles. Main Poc died in 1816, furthering the trend to leaders who were comfortable in both the Potawatomi villages and the American trading companies.

History The name Krepeni appears in a title deed executed by Nicholas Bagas Baldovin of Serbia. The village of Krepeni had a historical relationship with both the nearby village of Mavrovo as well as with the Mavriotissa monastery, which was named Krepeniotissa in the early 17th century. In the beginning of 19th century Francois Pouqueville described Crepeni as a hamlet of eight families.Pouqueville, F.C.H.L. Travels in Epirus, Albania, Macedonia, and Thessaly, London 1820, p. 83. In the British Baldwin & Craddock Map of Greece (printed on 1 January 1830 by a printer located at 47 Paternoster Row, London) the village of Krepeni is not shown, although the nearby village of Mavrobo (alternative spelling of Mavrovo) is visible. The Mavriotissa monastery was a significant land owner in the village of Krepeni. In the end of the 18th century the patriarch of the Mavrovitis family moved his people from Krepeni to Mavrovo in order to avoid a plague epidemic. It is believed that there were frequent movements of population between the villages of Krepeni and Mavrovo. Stefan Verkovich, folklorist from Bosnia, noted in 1889 that there were 28 Bulgarian houses in Krepeni.

Blount was instrumental as the new broom that swept through the Dumfries club in the mid and late 90s replacing the previous regime under which the club had gone into stagnation and decline from the late 1960s. Blount was the first of the three chairman who combined have rebuilt Queens to the position the club is in today. Pre Queens Norman Blount was owner of a successful pharmacy business in Dumfries. His son Mark was part of the Queen of the South youth team that made the 1986 BP Youth Cup final against Aberdeen. The Queens side had beaten Celtic on the way to the final. Queens chairman Norman Blount became chairman of Queen of the South in April 1994.\\"Club History\\" on the official Queen of the South website Very quickly new ideas came along that showed that the club was in a new era:- * The new stand was built within 1 year of Blount becoming chairman * The club became the first senior club in the UK to establish a club museum * Queen of the South became the first club in the world to deploy astro turf on the outside of the touch line on a grass pitch (for linesmen to run along). Initially the Scottish Football Association agreed to this as a 12-month experiment. However, such was the success of the astro turf that the SFA brought the experiment to an early close and sanctioned use of this idea for any other club interested * The first senior club in the UK to use a lottery scheme to decide the annual shirt sponsor. Such was the success of the idea that the club became inundated with calls from other clubs enquiring on the best way to set such a scheme up The highlight on the pitch of the Blount regime was Queens making it to the final of the Scottish Challenge Cup for the first time. This was in 1997 where a battling Queens side lost out by 1-0 to Falkirk. Man of the match was Queens' Tommy Bryce.Tommy Bryce profile on \\"Queens Legends\\" on the official Queen of the South FC website However in November 1999 Blount candidly announced that he felt that he had taken the club as far as he could and resigned from being chairman. Two time divisional player of the year Andy Thomson was transferred for a Queens record fee of ¬£250,000 in 1994. As Thomson was to say on his return over a decade later, \\"Things have changed quite a bit while I've been away - a new stand, a completely new set-up and a more modern type of training system\\". Thomson added, \\"Norman Blount was an excellent chairman.\\"Andy Thomson profile on \\"Queens Legends\\" on the official Queen of the South FC website Players to have signed for Queens during the Blount regime include Jamie McAllister,Jamie McAllister interview on www.qosfc.com Derek Townsley, Jim Thomson, David Lilley, David Mathieson and Andy Aitken. In a later interview for the club website reflecting on his time at Queens McAllister said, \\"Norman Blount, the chairman at the time was different class\\". Queens after Blount The chairmanship was taken over by Ronnie Bradford who continued the progressive ambition started under Blount. Bradford left due to ill health in June 2003. It has been under Bradford and then succeeding chairman Davie Rae that the seeds sown by Blount have really come to fruition on the pitch. Since the turn of the millennium Queens have enjoyed both league and cup success by:- * Winning the 2001-02 Scottish Second Division to return to the top half of Scottish football * Winning the 2002-03 Scottish Challenge Cup * Progressing to the 2006-07 Scottish Cup quarter final before losing 2-1 to Hibernian * Usurping the 2006-07 Scottish Cup run by progressing beyond the quarter finals and then eliminating Aberdeen in the 2007-08 semi final. In the club's first ever Scottish Cup final Queens went down 3-2 to Rangers but still qualified for the 2nd qualification round of the UEFA Cup. Retirement Norman Blount enjoys his retirement playing golf and watching Queens as a spectator. He was among the Queens fans to make the trip in August 2008 to see Queens in the UEFA Cup 2nd qualification round game away to FC Nordsj√¶lland in Denmark. Blount is among the organisers in the events for the Queen of the South testimonial season of Andy Aitken.

Biography Ra√∫l daSilva began his film career in 1965 at the Jam Handy Organization of Detroit, Michigan. Starting as a writer in the animation department, Ra√∫l moved to live action and became a director of several hundred short films for clients such as General Motors, Merck & Co., Chevrolet, and The Boy Scouts of America. It was at this time that he became a producer-director of television commercials and director of public relation films. daSilva has been an adjunct instructor on the script scenario at St. John Fisher College and a lecturer in screenwriting and directing at NYU, Rochester Institute of Technology, Brooklyn College, and Ithaca College. He met one of his mentors, TV pioneer writer Rod Serling at Ithaca College where they both lectured. Following that, he worked with Serling on film productions and when the celebrated playwright died at age 50, daSilva was asked to write Serling's eulogy by the Rochester Times Union. Serling had died in the O.R. of Rochester's Strong Memorial Hospital. His summer home was a boathouse on Cayuga Lake, near Ithaca. A re-write of the eulogy was published as \\"My Friend, Rod Serling, His Legacy\\" in the July/August 2008 issue of Fate Magazine. With the urging by actor Sterling Hayden who had been a master of tall ships in his youth, daSilva released his critically acclaimed film adaptation of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner in 1975. For the film, he used the technique of photoanimation, a technology that he learned at the Jam Handy Organization‚Äôs animation department. This allowed him to inexpensively bring to the screen the efforts of illustrators from the 19th and 20th centuries who sought to breathe life into the timeless epic poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. After some research he discovered that British actor Sir Michael Redgrave had once taught the epic poem as a schoolmaster. After contracting the actor daSilva flew to London to have Redgrave narrate the epic poem. With over two years in production, the film demonstrated the most complex work in existence today on the craft of photoanimation due to the mixed combination of movements and exposures between the vertical camera and the compass rose movements of the camera stand compound or platform where the graphic material is placed. With the craft becoming computer driven the complexity used at that time is no longer possible today, similarly, as stated by Pixar/Disney's creative genius, John Lasseter who has said that the subtle and complex character renderings of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs can not be done using a computer but must be rendered by hand. The production was widely acclaimed by critics and recognized by six international film festival juries throughout the United States that awarded five first place prizes to the film. In this effort, Ra√∫l renewed interest for this 1798 epic poem that speaks to the sanctity of all life on Earth. The film has been distributed throughout North America since 1985 and was also broadcast in Australia. In addition, daSilva has written magazine articles on spirituality and has presented lectures throughout New York City on the eternal spirit in the ephemeral human experience. Raul daSilva currently resides in New Haven, Connecticut, where he writes freelance articles and fiction projects. He also writes website articles.

Within evolutionary biology, this term has been used sporadically to refer to cases in which an evolved, and presumably adaptive, trait has suddenly become maladaptive, leading to the extinction of the species. Within behavioral and ecological sciences, evolutionary traps occur when rapid environmental change triggers organisms to make maladaptive behavioral decisions. While these traps may take place within any type of behavioral context (e.g. mate selection, navigation, nest-site selection), the most empirically and theoretically well-understood type of evolutionary trap is the ecological trap which represents maladaptive habitat selection behavior. Witherington demonstrates an interesting case of a \\"navigational trap\\". Over evolutionary time, hatchling sea turtles have evolved the tendency to migrate toward the light of the moon upon emerging from their sand nests. However, in the modern world, this has resulted in them tending to orient towards bright beach-front lighting, which is a more intense light source than the moon. As a result, the hatchlings migrate up the beach and away from the ocean where they exhaust themselves, desiccate and die either as a result of exhaustion, dehydration or predation. Habitat selection is an extremely important process in the lifespan of most organisms. That choice affects nearly all of an individual‚Äôs subsequent choices, so it may not be particularly surprising the type of evolutionary trap with the best empirical support is the ecological trap. Even so, traps may be relatively difficult to detect and so the lack of evidence for other types of evolutionary trap may be a result of the paucity of researchers looking for them coupled with the demanding evidence required to demonstrate their existence.

Founded as an expansion team in 1970 along with the Buffalo Sabres, the Vancouver Canucks were the first NHL team to be based in Vancouver. They adopted the name of the minor professional hockey team that had existed in Vancouver since 1945. After initially struggling as an expansion team in the NHL, the Canucks won their first division title in 1975, then proceed to set a record for North American professional sports, with sixteen consecutive losing seasons. Led by captain Stan Smyl, the Canucks made their first Stanley Cup Finals appearance in 1982, losing in four straight games to the New York Islanders. After acquiring several key players, including Trevor Linden, Pavel Bure and Kirk McLean, they won consecutive division titles in 1992 and 1993. The Canucks made a second appearance in the Stanley Cup Final in 1994, losing in the seventh and deciding game to the New York Rangers. Returning to several years of mediocre play in the late 1990s, the team improved under the leadership of captain Markus Naslund in the early part of the 21st century. Background Vancouver became home to a professional ice hockey team for the first time in 1911 when Patrick brothers Frank and Lester established the Vancouver Millionaires, one of three teams in the new Pacific Coast Hockey Association. To accommodate the Millionaires, the Patrick brothers directed the building of the Denman Arena, which was known at the time as the world's largest artificial ice rink (it burned down in 1936). The Millionaires played for the Stanley Cup five times, winning over the Ottawa Senators in 1915 on home ice. It marked the first time the Stanley Cup was won to a west coast team in the trophy's history. After the Millionaires disbanded following the 1925‚Äì26 season, Vancouver was home to only minor league teams for many years. Most notably, the present-day Canucks' minor league predecessor (also known as the Vancouver Canucks), played from 1945 to 1970 in the Pacific Coast Hockey League and Western Hockey League. 1967‚Äì1970: NHL application With the intention of attracting an NHL franchise, Vancouver began the construction of a new modern arena, the Pacific Coliseum, in 1967. The WHL's Canucks were playing in a small indoor arena at the time, the Vancouver Forum, situated on the same Pacific National Exhibition grounds as the Coliseum. Meanwhile, a Vancouver group led by WHL Canucks owner and former Vancouver mayor Fred Hume made a bid to be one of the six teams due to join the league in 1967, but the NHL rejected their application. Bid leader Cyril McLean called the denial a \\"cooked-up deal\\", referring to several biases that factored against them. Speculation long abounded afterwards that the bid was hindered by Toronto Maple Leafs president Stafford Smythe; after a failed Vancouver-based business deal, he was quoted as saying that the city would not get a NHL franchise in his lifetime. Additionally, along with the Montreal Canadiens, Smythe purportedly did not wish to split Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) hockey revenues three ways rather than two.Total Hockey, ed. Dan Diamond (1998), Andrews McMeel, p. 251. There were reports at the time, however, that the group had made a very weak proposal in expectation that Vancouver was a lock for one of the new franchises. Less than a year later, the Oakland Seals were in financial difficulty and having trouble drawing fans. An apparent deal was in place to move the team to Vancouver, but the NHL did not want to see one of their franchises from the expansion of 1967 move so quickly and nixed the deal. In exchange for avoiding a lawsuit, the NHL promised Vancouver would get a team in the next expansion. Another group, headed by Minnesota entrepreneur Tom Scallen, made a new presentation, and was awarded an expansion franchise for the price of $6 million (three times the cost in 1967).Rossiter 1994, p. 27. The new ownership group purchased the WHL Canucks, and joined the league along with the Buffalo Sabres for the 1970‚Äì71 season. Team history 1970‚Äì82: Early years To fill the Canucks' roster for their inaugural season, the NHL held an Expansion Draft in the preceding summer. A draft lottery was held on June 9, 1970, determining who between the Canucks and Sabres would receive the first selection in the Expansion Draft, as well as the 1970 NHL Amateur Draft; the Sabres won both spins. With his first selection in the Expansion Draft, Canucks general manager Bud Poile chose defenceman Gary Doak.Rossiter 1994, pp. 27‚Äì28. Among the other players chosen by Vancouver were centre Orland Kurtenbach, who was named the Canucks' first-ever captain; as well as defenceman Pat Quinn, who later became the team's general manager and coach in the 1990s. Two days later, on June 11, 1970, the Canucks made defenceman Dale Tallon their first-ever Amateur Draft selection. Tallon played three seasons with the club before being traded away to the Chicago Black Hawks. By comparison, the Sabres chose centre Gilbert Perrault with the first overall selection they won from the lottery; Perrault went on to become a nine-time All-Star and member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.Rossiter 1994, p. 28. At this time, the NHL was divided into East and West Divisions, however the actual makeup of divisions was not strictly determined by geography. Instead, the East consisted of the Original Six teams while the West comprised the teams that had joined in 1967. One of the conditions of the 1970 expansion was that the new teams would join the established East while the westernmost of the Original Six teams (the Chicago Black Hawks) would move to the West. As a result, despite playing on the West Coast, Vancouver made its NHL debut in the East Division. The main benefit to the Canucks from this arrangement was it allowed the Canucks more lucrative dates against the other five Original Six teams, including their Canadian rivals in Montreal and Toronto. With the Canucks' roster set, the team played its inaugural game against the Los Angeles Kings on October 9, 1970. They lost the contest 3‚Äì1; defenceman Barry Wilkins scored the Canucks' lone goal in the game and first in franchise history, a backhander against goaltender Denis DeJordy. Two days later, the squad recorded the first win in franchise history, a 5‚Äì3 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs.Media Guide 2008, p. 146. Not surprisingly given the tough divisional alignment, the Canucks struggled in their early years, failing to make the playoffs in their first four seasons. In an effort to compete in the East, Poile assembled a core of players during this period led by Kurtenbach that included defencemen Tallon and Jocelyn Guevremont, as well as wingers Andre Boudrias and Dennis Ververgaert. Boudrias emerged as the team's leading point-scorer in four of their first five seasons. Prior to the 1974‚Äì75 season, Scallen and his ownership group from Minnesota sold the team to local media mogul Frank Griffiths for $9 million.Rossiter 1994, p. 33. Also in the summer of 1974, the Canucks were re-aligned within the league and placed in the new Smythe Division. They responded with their first winning record (38 wins, 32 losses and 10 ties), finishing first in the division with 86 points.Media Guide 2008, pp. 146‚Äì82. Making their debut in the Stanley Cup playoffs, the Canucks lost the opening series of the 1975 post-season in five games to the Montreal Canadiens. Head coach and general manager Phil Maloney (the third GM in team history after Poile and Hal Laycoe) recalled the importance of a successful season for the Canucks in that year specifically, as the rival league World Hockey Association (WHA) had established another major professional team in the city, the Vancouver Blazers. Competing for the same hockey market, the Canucks emerged over the Blazers as the latter relocated to Calgary the following season.Rossiter 1994, p. 39. The Canucks posted a second consecutive winning record and made the playoffs in 1975‚Äì76, but lost to the New York Islanders in a two-game preliminary series. The Canucks missed the playoffs in the two seasons thereafter. Meanwhile, Kurtenbach had since retired and assumed a coaching position with Vancouver. His departure as a player marked the beginning of a seven-year period in which the Canucks had four different captains ‚Äì Boudrias, Chris Oddleifson, Don Lever and Kevin McCarthy. Following their post-season loss to the Islanders in 1976, Vancouver did not have another winning season for 16 years, though they made the playoffs nine times in that span. Following the 1976‚Äì77 season, Maloney was replaced as general manager by Jake Milford, who acquired such players as Stan Smyl, Thomas Gradin and Richard Brodeur, a core that would lead the team throughout the 1980s.Rossiter 1994, p. 47. =1982 Stanley Cup run= A statue of coach Roger Neilson outside of Rogers Arena, commemorating the 1982 Stanley Cup run. The Canucks made their first significant playoff impact in the post-season of 1982. In their previous five playoff appearances, the team had failed to win a single series. Though the Canucks finished three games under a .500 win percentage in the 1981‚Äì82 regular season, they began gaining momentum by finishing the campaign on a nine-game unbeaten streak.Rossiter 1994, p. 57. Meanwhile, Smyl emerged as the club's leader, replacing McCarthy as captain after the latter was sidelined with an injury late in the season (he would retain that position for a team-record eight years). Continuing their success in the playoffs, the Canucks made the Stanley Cup Finals with a combined 11‚Äì2 record in series against the Calgary Flames, Los Angeles Kings and Chicago Black Hawks.Media Guide 2008, p. 235. Despite having a losing regular season record, Vancouver had home ice advantage in the first series, having finished second in the Smythe Division to the Edmonton Oilers. The Canucks also had home ice advantage during the second round series against the Kings, who upset the Oilers in the first round. During the Conference Finals against the Black Hawks, Vancouver interim head coach Roger Neilson, frustrated with what he felt was the poor officiating in the game, placed a white towel on the end of a hockey stick and held it up in a gesture mocking surrender (waving the white flag). The players on the Canucks' bench followed suit. At the next game, the team's fans cheered their team on by waving white towels above their heads. The habit stuck, becoming an original Canuck fan tradition now seen across the NHL and in other sports, known as \\"Towel Power\\". The Canucks proceeded to win the series, reaching the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in their history.Rossiter 1994, p. 58. Entering the Finals against the New York Islanders, the Canucks were the first team from Western Canada to play for the Stanley Cup in 56 years, when the Victoria Cougars reached the 1926 Stanley Cup Finals. It also marked the first ever coast-to- coast Stanley Cup Finals. Competing against the Islanders ‚Äì the Stanley Cup champions of the previous two years who had finished with 41 points more than Vancouver in the regular season standings ‚Äì Vancouver took the first game to overtime. In the final minute of the extra period, Canucks defenceman and fan favourite Harold Snepsts gave the puck away with an errant pass from behind his net, leading to a Mike Bossy goal.Rossiter 1994, p. 61. The Canucks were unable to complete their Cinderella run and were swept, losing their next three games by 6‚Äì4, 3‚Äì0 and 3‚Äì1 scores. The 1982 playoffs proved to be the last year in which Vancouver won a playoff series until 1992. 1982‚Äì94: Decline and resurgence Sculpture featuring Stan Smyl, who was the Canucks captain from 1982 to 1990. After their improbable Stanley Cup run, the Canucks slipped back into mediocrity for the rest of the 1980s. At the time, the NHL had one of the easiest playoff qualification formats in the history of professional sports, with four of five teams from the Smythe making the playoffs, nevertheless, the Canucks qualified only four times for the rest of the decade. Notable players that joined the Canucks' core following the 1982 playoffs included offensively-skilled forwards Patrik Sundstrom and Tony Tanti. Beginning in 1983‚Äì84, the Canucks' scoring title was held by either Sundstrom or Tanti for four of the next five seasons. For most of the second half of the 1980s, the Canucks competed with the Los Angeles Kings for the final playoff spot in the Smythe Division. The years in which they qualified, the team was eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers (in ) or the Calgary Flames (in , and 1989), both division rivals. Following Milford's tenure as general manager from 1977 to 1982, the position was held by Harry Neale for three years, then Jack Gordon for two. The latter was responsible for trading away power forward Cam Neely to the Boston Bruins in 1986.Rossiter 1994, p. 62. Neely went on to have a Hall of Fame career with the Bruins, recording three 50-goal seasons. In return, the Canucks acquired centre Barry Pederson. While Pederson collected back-to-back 70-point seasons with the Canucks in his first two seasons after the trade, he was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1989, as his performance quickly declined. Pavel Bure was drafted by the Canucks in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft. After the installation of former Canucks defenceman Pat Quinn as general manager in the summer of 1987, the team underwent an immediate rebuilding process, trading away core veterans for younger prospects and players. Among the more key transactions was a deal with the New Jersey Devils, in which Sundstrom was traded away in exchange for winger Greg Adams and goaltender Kirk McLean. In addition to Quinn's trades, the team improved through the draft route with two selections, in particular. With the second overall selection in the 1988 NHL Entry Draft, the Canucks chose winger Trevor Linden from the Western Hockey League (WHL). The following year, the team made a controversial selection by choosing Russian winger Pavel Bure 113th overall; Bure was believed by most teams to be ineligible for selection that year. Consequently, his draft by the Canucks took a year to be verified by the NHL as team management went about procuring documents to prove his eligibility.Rossiter 1994, p. 71. As the decade turned, a shift in the Canucks' leadership occurred as Stan Smyl resigned his captaincy prior to the 1990‚Äì91 season due to a reduced on-ice role with the team. In his place, the Canucks implemented a rotating captaincy of Linden, Dan Quinn and Doug Lidster; of the three Linden retained the captaincy thereafter, becoming the youngest permanent captain in team history at age 21. At the end of the season, Smyl retired as the team's all-time leader in games played, goals, assists and points. Led by Linden and in large part to Quinn's dealings, the Canucks rose to prominence in the early 1990s. This increased success came roughly around the time the Oilers and Flames began to sink in the standings. As a result, Vancouver won their first division title in 17 years with 42 wins, 26 losses and 12 ties during the 1991‚Äì92 season. During the campaign, the Canucks honoured Smyl, who had remained the team as an assistant coach, by making him the first player in team history to have his jersey (number 12) retired. In the 1992 playoffs, the Canucks won their first series since 1982 before being eliminated by the Oilers in the second round. Quinn and Bure became the first Canucks recipients of major NHL awards in the off-season, being awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach (Quinn assumed a dual coaching and general managerial role starting that year) and the top rookie in the league, respectively. The following year, the Canucks repeated as regular season division champions, while Bure emerged as arguably the team's first superstar with his first of back-to-back 60-goal seasons, totals which remain the highest recorded in Canucks history. =1994 Stanley Cup run= In , the Canucks made their second trip to the Stanley Cup finals, entering the playoffs as the seventh seed in the renamed Western Conference. Despite underachieving in the regular season (their points total decreased by 16 from the previous year), the Canucks played well in the playoffs and embarked on another unexpected run. Opening the playoffs with a close first-round series against the Calgary Flames, Vancouver rallied from a three-games-to-one deficit to win the series in seven contests. Games 5 through 7 were all won in overtime with goals from Geoff Courtnall, Trevor Linden and Pavel Bure.Rossiter 1994, pp. 15‚Äì16. The deciding seventh game featured two of the most recognizable and celebrated plays in Canucks history. With the game tied 3‚Äì3 in the first overtime, goaltender Kirk McLean made what became known thereafter as \\"The Save\\", sliding across the crease feet-first and stacking his pads on the goal line to stop Robert Reichel on a one-timer pass from Theoren Fleury. The following period, Bure received a breakaway pass from defenceman Jeff Brown before deking Calgary goaltender Mike Vernon to score and win the series. Fifteen years later, Bure's goal and McLean's save were ranked first and second in a Vancouver Sun article listing the \\"40 most memorable moments in team history\\". Following their victory over the Flames, the Canucks then went on to defeat both the Dallas Stars and Toronto Maple Leafs (both in five games) en route to the franchise's second Stanley Cup Finals appearance. Forward Greg Adams sent the Canucks into the Finals with a double-overtime goal against Maple Leafs goaltender Felix Potvin in Game 5. Staging the second coast-to-coast Finals in league history, the Canucks were matched against the Presidents' Trophy-winning New York Rangers. Vancouver won Game 1, 3‚Äì2 in overtime, largely due to a 52-save performance by goaltender McLean.Rossiter 1994, p. 87. After losing Games 2, 3 and 4, the Canucks won the next two to force a Game 7 at Madison Square Garden on June 14, 1994. Despite a two-goal effort (one on a shorthanded breakaway) from Linden (who was playing with cracked ribs), Vancouver lost the game 3‚Äì2. The Canucks' efforts to tie the game included a post hit by forward Nathan LaFayette with just over a minute remaining in regulation.Rossiter 1994, p. 103. The loss was followed by a riot in Downtown Vancouver, which resulted in property damage, injuries and arrests. Two days after the riots, the team held a rally at BC Place attended by 45,000 fans, who congratulated the team for their effort. 1994‚Äì2001 General Motors Place prior to a Canucks game, October 1997. The Canucks moved into General Moters Place (since renamed Rogers Arena) in 1995. With a young core that included Linden, Bure and McLean still in their twenties after the 1994 playoffs, the Canucks appeared poised to remain contenders in the league. However, the team failed to record a winning season in the six years following their Stanley Cup Finals appearance. Prior to the lockout-shortened 1994‚Äì95 season, Quinn stepped down as head coach to focus on his managerial duties and was replaced by Rick Ley; Vancouver finished with a .500 record that year. Their elimination from the 1995 Stanley Cup playoffs in Game 4 of the second round marked the Canucks' last game played at the Pacific Coliseum, as the team moved into the General Motors Place (since renamed Rogers Arena), a new $160 million arena situated in Downtown Vancouver, the following season. The Canucks made another significant move in the off-season by acquiring high-scoring Russian forward Alexander Mogilny from the Buffalo Sabres, reuniting Bure with his former CSKA Moscow and national team linemate. While Mogilny became the second player in team history to record 50 goals and 100 points in a season, the expected chemistry between him and Bure never materialized as the latter suffered a season-ending knee injury early in the campaign. Vancouver finished 1995‚Äì96 two games below .500 and were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the Colorado Avalanche. The season also marked the arrival of another future Canucks superstar, as Markus Naslund was acquired from the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Alek Stojanov. The deal is regarded as one of the most lopsided trades in NHL history as Stojanov soon became a minor-leaguer, while Naslund became the team's all-time leading goal- and point-scorer years later. In the 1996 off-season. Ley was replaced by Tom Renney, who lasted for less than two seasons. Despite strong performances from Mogilny and team-leading point-scorer Martin Gelinas in Bure and Linden's absence (both of whom were injured for long periods of time during the season), the Canucks missed the playoffs for the first of four consecutive seasons that year. Making another high-profile acquisition in July 1997, the Canucks signed free agent Mark Messier to a three-year deal. They had come close to signing Wayne Gretzky the previous summer, but were reportedly spurned away when they refused to continue negotiations and gave Gretzky an ultimatum to sign. Heading into the 1997‚Äì98 season, Linden resigned his captaincy for Messier, who had developed a strong reputation as a leader, having captained the Rangers over the Canucks in 1994 (he also captained the Oilers to a Stanley Cup in 1990). Linden later recalled regretting the decision, feeling that Messier generated hostility and tension in the dressing room. As the team's performance continued to worsen, starting the 1997‚Äì98 season with 3 wins in the first 16 games, Quinn was fired as general manager after ten years with the team. Soon thereafter, Renney was fired and replaced as head coach by Mike Keenan, reuniting the two figures from the Rangers' 1994 team. Keenan's hiring reportedly exacerbated tensions between groups of Canucks players and his negative relationship with Linden was given much media attention. Two months into his tenure with the team, his role was expanded and he was made de facto general manager. With control of player personnel, Keenan overhauled the roster, making ten trades within two months, most notably dealing Linden to the New York Islanders. Although the trade was unpopular with fans, the Canucks received winger Todd Bertuzzi in return, who would later become an integral part of the team's return to success in the next decade. After the Canucks finished the 1997‚Äì98 season last in the Western Conference, former NHL vice president Brian Burke was named general manager in the summer. Suffering their worst season since 1977‚Äì78 the subsequent year, Keenan was fired midway through and replaced with Marc Crawford (who had won the Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche in 1996). Meanwhile, Pavel Bure, unhappy in Vancouver, had withheld himself from the team and requested a trade at the beginning of the campaign. By January 1999, he was dealt to the Florida Panthers in a seven-player trade that also involved two draft picks. Finishing last in the Western Conference for a second straight year, Vancouver possessed the third overall pick in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft. Set on drafting highly touted Swedish forwards Daniel and Henrik Sedin, Burke orchestrated several transactions to move up to the second and third overall picks, with which he chose both players. The Canucks began to show improvement in the 1999‚Äì2000 season, finishing four points out of a playoff spot. During the campaign, Mogilny was traded to the New Jersey Devils for forwards Denis Pederson and Brendan Morrison. With Bure gone and Messier in the last year of his contract, several previously under-achieving players began developing into key contributors for the team, most notably Naslund and Bertuzzi. In the off- season, Messier left the team and returned to the Rangers; during the team's September 2000 training camp, held in Sweden, Naslund was selected to replace Messier as captain, a position he held for eight years, tying Smyl's record. As part of the team's stay in Sweden, they played exhibition games against Swedish and Finnish teams as part of the NHL Challenge. 2001‚Äì05: \\"West Coast Express\\" years Under the leadership of general manager Burke and coach Crawford, the Canucks once again became a playoff team. After qualifying for the post-season in 2001 and 2002 as the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference (losing to the eventual Stanley Cup winners Colorado Avalanche and Detroit Red Wings, respectively), the Canucks became regular contenders for the Northwest Division title. Coinciding with the team's success in the early 2000s was the rise of captain Markus Naslund and power forward Todd Bertuzzi into high-scoring wingers and NHL All-Stars. Joined by center Brendan Morrison during the 2001‚Äì02 season, the trio were nicknamed the \\"West Coast Express\\" (after the Vancouver rail service of the same name) among Canucks fans and media. Over the next three years, Naslund ranked in the top five among league scorers and was a Lester B. Pearson Award winner and Hart Memorial Trophy finalist in 2003. Bertuzzi was also a top-five scorer in the NHL in 2001‚Äì02 and 2002‚Äì03. During this span, Burke made a trade with the Washington Capitals to facilitate the return of Trevor Linden. The ex-captain returned to a markedly different Canucks team with a young core consisting of the aforementioned trio, defencemen Ed Jovanovski and Mattias Ohlund, as well as goaltender Dan Cloutier. In 2002‚Äì03, the Canucks lost the division title to the Colorado Avalanche on the last day of the regular season. Individually, Naslund was surpassed the same night by Avalanche forwards Peter Forsberg and Milan Hejduk for the Maurice Richard and Art Ross Trophies, respectively. Entering the 2003 playoffs with the fourth seed in the West, the Canucks won their first playoff series in eight years, defeating the St. Louis Blues in seven games before losing to the Minnesota Wild in the second round. Amidst a run for the team's first Northwest Division title the following season, the Canucks received significant media attention for their involvement in a violent on-ice attack during a game against the Avalanche. On March 8, 2004, Bertuzzi grabbed Avalanche forward Steve Moore from behind and punched him the head. As Moore fell to the ice, Bertuzzi landed on top of him; Moore suffered three fractured neck vertebrae, facial cuts and a concussion. Bertuzzi's actions were in retaliation of a hit that Moore landed on Naslund during a previous game between the two teams. For his actions, Bertuzzi was suspended by the NHL and International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) through to the start of the 2005‚Äì06 season. He also faced legal action in British Columbia court, while Moore filed lawsuits against him and the Canucks organization in Colorado and Ontario courts. The Canucks went on to win their first Northwest Division title that season, but lost in the first round of the 2004 playoffs to the Calgary Flames. After their elimination, Burke's contract as general manager was not renewed and he was replaced by assistant general manager and director of hockey operations Dave Nonis. At age 37, he was the youngest general manager in team history. Due to the NHL lockout, the 2004‚Äì05 season was not played. Several Canucks players went overseas to Europe to play professionally, such as Naslund and the Sedins, who all returned to their former Swedish team, Modo Hockey. 2005‚Äì11: Post-lockout Upon the resolution of the labour dispute between NHL players and owners, new gameplay rules were set in place for the 2005‚Äì06 season that were supposed to benefit skilled players and generate more scoring. As the Canucks' basis of success in previous seasons was built on playing a fast-paced, high-scoring style of play, expectations for the team were high going into the season. However, the team failed to qualify for the playoffs, completing the regular season ninth place in the West. The first line of Naslund, Bertuzzi and Morrison suffered offensively, as all three players recorded decreased points totals. Head coach Marc Crawford later recalled the campaign as a turning point for the team's offensive leadership as Daniel and Henrik Sedin began their rise to stardom, matching the top line's production. Crawford was fired in the off-season and replaced with Alain Vigneault, who had been coach of the team's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manitoba Moose. Three days after Vigneault's hiring, Nonis dealt Bertuzzi to the Florida Panthers, ending the \\"West Coast Express\\" era. In return, the Canucks received All-Star goaltender Roberto Luongo as part of a six-player trade. With the acquisition of Luongo, Cloutier was traded to the Los Angeles Kings. 2007 Western Conference Quarterfinals between the Canucks and the Dallas Stars. Ending at the 138-minute mark, it was the longest game in the club's history. With widespread changes to team personnel in 2006‚Äì07, the Canucks won the Northwest Division title for the second time in three seasons. In his first season with the Canucks, Luongo was nominated for the Hart Memorial and Vezina Trophies. He also tied Bernie Parent for the second-most wins in a single-season by an NHL goaltender with 47. The Canucks opened the 2007 playoffs with a quadruple- overtime win against the Dallas Stars. Ending at the 138-minute mark, the game was the longest in club history and the sixth-longest in league history. The Canucks also set an NHL record for shots against in one game, allowing 76. Vancouver won the series in seven games despite a lack of goal-scoring; Stars goaltender Marty Turco recorded three shutouts in the series, becoming the only goalie to achieve the feat and still lose a series. Advancing to the second round, the team was defeated by the Anaheim Ducks, who went on to win the Stanley Cup that year, in five games. Following the playoffs, coach Vigneault received the Jack Adams Award. Suffering numerous injuries to players in the 2007‚Äì08 season, the Canucks struggled and finished three points out of a playoff spot. The final game of the season, a 7‚Äì1 loss to the Calgary Flames, marked Trevor Linden's last NHL game, as the former Canucks' all-time leading scorer retired. Having missed the playoffs for the second time in three years, the team underwent numerous personnel changes in the off-season. After Nonis was fired and replaced with former player agent Mike Gillis in April 2008, longtime Canucks captain Markus Naslund, as well as Brendan Morrison, were let go via free agency. Also in the off-season, on May 29, 2008, the Canucks lost defensive prospect Luc Bourdon to a motorcycle crash near his hometown of Shippagan, New Brunswick. Roberto Luongo during the 2008‚Äì09 season, with a C visible on his goalie mask denoting his captaincy. He was named captain of the Canucks in September 2008. With Naslund's departure, Gillis announced on September 30, 2008, that Luongo had been named team captain, marking the first time since Bill Durnan of the Montreal Canadiens in 1947 that a goaltender that a goaltender had been named the captain of their NHL team. During the ensuing season, the Canucks retired their second jersey number in team history, hanging Linden's number 16 beside Smyl's number 12 in a pre-game ceremony on December 17, 2008. Later that month, the Canucks acquired unrestricted free agent Mats Sundin. The arrival of the former Toronto Maple Leafs captain and 500-goal scorer in the NHL came with expectations. However, Sundin scored at a pace below his usual pace and retired in the off-season. The team finished the regular season with another Northwest Division title and the third seed in the Western Conference. In the 2009 playoffs, the Canucks swept their first round series against the St. Louis Blues (the first four-game sweep in franchise history), but were defeated in six games by the Chicago Blackhawks in the second round. In the 2009‚Äì10 season, the Canucks faced the longest road trip in NHL history, with 14 games over 6 weeks, from January 27 to March 13, 2010. The scheduling was a result of Vancouver hosting the 2010 Winter Olympics, which shut down the NHL for two weeks, facilitating GM Place's use for ice hockey during the games. It marked the first time an NHL market hosted an Olympics since the NHL allowed its players to compete in the games, beginning with the 1998 Games in Nagano. Among the several Canucks players named to their respective national teams, centre Ryan Kesler of the United States and goaltender Roberto Luongo of Canada played against each other in the gold medal game; Luongo and Team Canada emerged with the win. As the NHL season resumed, Henrik Sedin went on to become the first Canucks player to win the Art Ross and Hart Memorial Trophies as the NHL's leading scorer and most valuable player, respectively. He achieved the feat with a franchise record 112 points, surpassing Bure's mark of 110 set in 1991‚Äì92. Vancouver won the Northwest Division title and finished third in the Western Conference for the second straight year. They opened the playoffs by defeating the sixth-place Los Angeles Kings in six games, but were once again eliminated by Chicago, who went on to win the Stanley Cup that year, the following round in six games. =40th anniversary season and 2011 Stanley Cup run= Orland Kurtenbach's plaque on the Canuck's Ring of Honour, which was established as a part of the franchise's 40th anniversary season. The 2010‚Äì11 season began on October 9, 2010, with a pre- game ceremony to commemorate the team's 40-year anniversary. Henrik Sedin was officially named in the ceremony as the team's new captain, replacing Luongo, who had relinquished his captaincy in the off-season. The Canucks played the Los Angeles Kings, their first opponent in their inaugural season in 1970; both teams wore their original uniforms used in the Canucks' inaugural game. Throughout the season, the Canucks continued to celebrate their 40th anniversary with the creation of the \\"Ring of Honour\\", a permanent in-arena display commemorating their most significant players from past years. Four players were inducted during the campaign: Orland Kurtenbach, Kirk McLean, Thomas Gradin and Harold Snepsts. In December 2010, the Canucks also honoured Markus Naslund by retiring his number 19 jersey. Naslund had retired two years after leaving the Canucks in 2008. During the second half of the campaign, the Canucks were in a battles for the Western Conference and Presidents' Trophy titles with the Detroit Red Wings and Philadelphia Flyers, respectively, widening the gap as the season progressed. On March 29, 2011, the Canucks clinched first place in the West for the first time in team history. Two days later, they accomplished another first by securing the Presidents' Trophy. Finishing with 54 wins and 117 points, the 2010‚Äì11 team broke the previous records in both categories by significant margins. Individually, numerous Canucks players had career years. Daniel Sedin won the Art Ross Trophy with a league-leading 104 points, marking the first time in NHL history that two brothers won the award in back-to-back years. Meanwhile, Ryan Kesler tied Daniel for the team goal-scoring lead with 41 goals. In goal, Roberto Luongo and rookie backup Cory Schneider captured the William M. Jennings Trophy for recording the lowest team goals against average in the NHL. Henrik Sedin accepts the Campbell Bowl on behalf of the Canucks as the 2011 Western Conference champions. Entering the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Canucks were paired with the eighth-seeded and defending Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks, who had eliminated Vancouver in the previous two years. While Vancouver initially took a 3‚Äì0 lead in the series, Chicago came back to also win three straight games and force the series into a game seven. Luongo, who had a history of struggling against the Blackhawks, was pulled in Games 4 and 5; he also began Game 6 on the bench in favour of Cory Schneider before returning as the starter in Game 7. In the deciding game, Vancouver held a 1‚Äì0 lead with less than two minutes remaining in regulation when they gave up a shorthanded goal to Chicago captain Jonathan Toews. Forced into overtime, winger Alexandre Burrows scored his second goal of the game following a failed clearing attempt by Chicago defenceman Chris Campoli to win the series. In the Conference Semifinals, the Canucks faced the defensive-minded Nashville Predators, led by goaltender Pekka Rinne. Of the 14 goals Vancouver scored in the low-scoring series, Canucks center Ryan Kesler registered a point in 11 of them, helping the Canucks defeat the Predators in six games. Facing the San Jose Sharks in the Conference Finals, captain Henrik Sedin led the Canucks with 12 points in the five-game series. Vancouver defeated San Jose four- games-to-one with a double-overtime winner from defenceman Kevin Bieksa in the fifth game. Advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1994, the Canucks opened the fourth round against the Boston Bruins with a 1‚Äì0 win in Game 1. Winger Raffi Torres scored the winning goal with 18.5 seconds remaining. In the following game, the Canucks won 3‚Äì2 in overtime with Burrows scoring the winner 11 seconds into the extra frame, making it the second fastest overtime goal in Stanley Cup Finals history. As the series shifted from Rogers Arena to TD Garden for Games 3 and 4, Boston tied the series with 8‚Äì1 and 4‚Äì0 victories. Game 3 marked the highest score by one team in a Finals game since the Avalanche defeated the Panthers in 1996. During the contest, the Bruins lost first-line forward Nathan Horton for the remainder of the series when he suffered a serious concussion from a late hit by Canucks defenceman Aaron Rome, who received a four-game suspension as a result. Returning to Vancouver for Game 5, the Canucks won 1‚Äì0 with a goal from late- season acquisition Maxim Lapierre in the third period. With an opportunity to win the Stanley Cup in Boston, Vancouver lost Game 6 by a 5‚Äì2 score. The Bruins' first four goals occurred in a span of 4 minutes and 14 seconds during the first period, setting a Finals record for the fastest four goals scored by a team (surpassing the previous mark of 5 minutes and 29 seconds set by the Montreal Canadiens in 1956). In game 7 the Canucks were shut out by the Bruins, 4‚Äì0, giving the Bruins their first Stanley Cup in 39 years.

The Air Force contributed $7 million for equipment for the new hospital in 1998 and DoD patients will get substantial discounts at the hospital for 15 years, with a guaranteed recovery of $7 million within the first seven years. Medical services The hospital is a Level III trauma center. It has 99 beds on a campus and facilities for MRI, CAT scan, dialysis, and sleep disorder studies, and has a medical laboratory on site. A Southwest Med Evac air ambulance helicopter, stationed full-time at the hospital, is used to transport patients from the mountain areas to GCRMC, and to transport patients from GCRMC to hospitals in El Paso, Las Cruces, and Albuquerque. The hospital hosts an American Cancer Society Cancer Resource Center at 1212 9th Street in Alamogordo. The Cancer Resource Center provides free of charge: literature, support groups, prostheses, wigs, and hats for cancer patients and cancer survivors. For more information go to visit www.cancer.org. Catering The hospital's food and nutrition services department operates a catering service, Mountain View Catering, that caters both on-site and off-site events and provides food service at the nearby New Mexico State University Alamogordo campus. It has been so successful that 60% of the department's revenue comes from outside the hospital. History Founding and early years The Otero County Hospital Association was formed in 1946 to build a basic county hospital. Gerald Champion Memorial Hospital was built at the corner of Tenth Street and Cuba Avenue in Alamogordo and was dedicated on Sunday, July 31, 1949 and officially opened for business on Tuesday, August 2, with 24 beds. A number of additions and renovations were made to the facility over the years. The hospital is named after Gerald D. Champion, a local businessman and civic leader who was chairman of the Otero County Hospital Association during the fund drive for the first building. Champion died in a private airplane crash on February 3, 1948, during the fund drive. In addition to chairing the fund drive, Champion was mayor of Tularosa, operated hardware and building supply stores in Alamogordo and in Tularosa, was chairman of the Central Committee of the state Republican Party, and was active in many civic groups. Transition to regional medical center The hospital moved to a new building on Scenic Drive near the New Mexico State University Alamogordo campus in 1999, and changed its name to Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center. The original building remained vacant for several years and when no use could be found for it was torn down in 2003. The new building was constructed at at a construction cost of $25,841,000. It won Building Design & Construction magazine's Grand Award: Institutional in 2000. The program manager was American Health Facilities Development (a subsidiary of Quorum Health Resources), the architects were Collins Reisenbichler Architects (since merged with Perkins and Will), and the general contractor was Robins & Morton. GCRMC celebrated its 60th anniversary on August 22, 2009 with the opening of a renovated entryway and a new obstetrics unit.

Pheia is mentioned by Homer, who places it near the Iardanus, which is apparently the mountain torrent north of Ichthys, and which flows into the sea on the northern side of the lofty mountain Skaph√≠di. It was built in a natural bay at today's Agios Andreas, Katakolo. It was destroyed in the 6th century.SKRIP newspaper, page 2, 3/31/1911, accessed from the Greek national library Upon a very conspicuous peaked height upon the isthmus of Ichthys are the ruins of a castle of the Middle Ages, called Pontikokastro, built upon the remains of the Hellenic walls of Pheia. On either side of Ichthys are two harbours; the northern one, which is a small creek, was the port of Pheia; the southern one is the broad bay of Katakolo, which is now much frequented, but was too open and exposed for ancient navigation. The position of these harbours explains the narrative of Thucydides, who relates that in the first year of the Peloponnesian War (431 BCE), the Athenian fleet, having sailed from Methone in Messenia, landed at Pheia (that is, in the bay of Katakolo), and laid waste the country; but a storm having arisen, they sailed round the promontory Ichthys into the harbour of Pheia. Thereafter the Athenians used the town and ports as a base for military operations in Elis. In front of the harbour was a small island, which Polybius calls Pheias. Archaeological remains The first excavations were made in 1911. In 1959 Nikos Yalouris explored the underwater remains of Pheia. In 1973 the Hellenic Institute of Marine Archaeology made a survey in the bay of Agios Andreas near Katakolo, and found the remains of the town at a depth of below sea level.Hellenic Institute of Marine Archaeology The archaeological remains at Agios Andreas date from the Early Helladic through the Byzantine periods. The finds included the remains of buildings, pot sherds, fragments of amphorae, the remains of a Roman cemetery and a Byzantine coin. Two cycladic marble figures from the Bronze Age were found on the headland, as well as finds of tombs and remains of Roman buildings on Tigani island. A kouros and the remains of a painted terracotta roof are among the finds dating to the late Archaic period. There is also prehistoric pottery scattered across the site. Destruction Recent studies at Agios Andreas have shown that the region suffered from the effects of tsunamis several times. Pheia was destroyed in 551 by a tsunami caused by an earthquake that was known historically. The earthquake was also responsible for the destruction of the city of Patras and for completing the destruction of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia.

Zallinger. The fresco sits in the Yale Peabody Museum in New Haven, Connecticut, and was completed in 1947 after five years of work. The Age of Reptiles was at one time the largest painting in the world, and depicts a span of nearly 350 million years in Earth's history. Painted in the Renaissance fresco secco technique, The Age of Reptiles showcases the contemporary view of dinosaurs as slow, sluggish creatures (a view that has been gradually replaced by more active dinosaurs). Zallinger received the Addison Emery Verrill medal in 1980 for the mural.  Background  Zallinger was an art student who in the early 1940s had been painting seaweed drawings for the Peabody museum. Dr. Albert E. Parr, then director of the Peabody Museum, had been unhappy with the appearance of the Great Hall of the museum, which he felt was devoid of color and barren.Scully, 18. Parr asked Lewis York, Zallinger's professor at art school, if he knew anyone who would be able to fill a large wall space in the Hall; York recommended Zallinger. On March 1, 1942, Zallinger was officially appointed to the wall-painting project. Initially, Zallinger planned on dividing the wall space, measuring 110 feet in length, 55 feet in width, and 26 feet in height, into separate panels.Scully, 19. After discussions with his supervisors, Zallinger instead decided on a different concept, which would use the entire wall for a \\"panorama of time.\\" Because Zallinger had never painted dinosaurs, Dr. G. Edward Lewis, the museum's curator of vertebrate paleontology, and Dr. George Wieland proceeded to give Zallinger a six-month crash course in vertebrate paleontology and paleobotany.Zallinger. Painting Zallinger sketched out his plan for the mural on a sheet of rag paper, which could be unrolled to edit individual sections. The position of entrances to the hall and the sequence of which Peabody's fossils are arranged made the mural be \\"read\\" from right to left, instead of the customary direction.Scully, 20. Zallinger used a Renaissance-era painting technique known as Fresco-secco. Though rarely used because of the difficulties of using egg tempera, fresco secco allowed Zallinger to delineate character as well as create a painting with good durability.Scully, 22.  Composition  In total, The Age of Reptiles spans about 362 million years, from the Devonian period at the mural's beginning to the end of the Cretaceous period, 65 million years ago.Ostrom. Each period's length on the mural is proportional to the period's length in geologic time. Each period of time is divided by large trees in the foreground.Gauthier, Hickey.

Despite its somewhat outdated view of dinosaurs, The Age of Reptiles is still notable for its historical and artistic merit and as the largest natural history painting in the world. It has been an inspiration to many visitors including both Robert Bakker and Peter Dodson, who credit it with influencing them to become paleontologists.

The vaginal cuff is created by suturing together the edges of the surgical site where the cervix was attached to the vagina. This is accomplished by bringing the edges of the vagina together and suturing them together and to the uterosacral ligaments to prevent prolapse. The peritoneum is also sewn into the newly created vaginal cuff. There may be an advantage to using one method of closure over another. The vaginal cuff has a tendency to partially or completely dehisce or open up. A further complication that can accompany the dehiscence of the vaginal cuff is evisceration or the movement of intestines into the vagina. Some or all of the vaginal cuff can reopen. The risk of vaginal cuff complications is related to the approach to hysterectomy: robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy, total laparoscopic hysterectomy, laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and total vaginal hysterectomy. The vaginal cuff can be stressed by sexual intercourse, chronic constipation, asthma, COPD, and other actions that increase intra-abdominal pressure. This structure is prone to infection, hematoma and other postoperative complications. Factors that are thought to affect wound healing are radiation treatments, age, pelvic organ prolapse, the use of corticosteroids, concurrent malignancy. Though rare, estimates of the prevalence of vaginal cuff dehiscence are difficult to assess due to the presence of only case studies and anecdotal reports. If the vaginal cuff is compromised, vaginal evisceration can occur with the small intestine protruding out through the vagina.

It was a twin-engine development of the single-engine LB-1, brought about by a change in policy by the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC). Design and development The shift from a nose-mounted engine to engines mounted in nacelles on the lower wing created an opportunity to provide stations for two extra crewmembers: a bombardier and a nose-gunner, bringing the total to five. The LB-1's single tailfin and rudder was augmented by an extra rudder either side of it. Operational history A single prototype was constructed, and delivered to the USAAC for evaluation at the end of 1927. Evaluation, however, showed that performance was actually inferior to that of the single-engine LB-1. The decision was taken to change the XLB-3's air-cooled inverted Liberty engines for air-cooled radials, at which point it was redesignated XLB-3A. With performance still unsatisfactory, development was abandoned in favor of a parallel design, the LB-5.

The station offers the facilities, advice, training and technical support for individuals and groups to create and broadcast their own media and radio programmes. Waiheke's population has distinct and diverse needs and interests arising from the island's geographical isolation, mix of rural and suburban lifestyle, and broad demographic range and is arguably not well served by radio transmitted solely from Auckland. The Waiheke Community Radio Trust established Waiheke Radio as a not-for-profit, community radio service for Waiheke in 2008 and began broadcasting on two Low Power FM transmitters later that year. One of the transmitters was paid for from a grant from the Waiheke Community Board. A community lease has also been secured in the Artworks complex in Oneroa after pressure was put on Auckland Council by members of the Waiheke Community board who lobbied for a month-to- month lease to be granted to the trust.  History   Island Radio 93.8FM  In early 1991 Peter and Adrienne Young and directors launched Island Radio 93.8FM. This was Waiheke's first true community radio station. It was owned and operated by Peter Young, with volunteer deejays and a small paid admin staff. Some of the more colourful personalities were Rick and Teddy, later Rick and Mitch in the morning, followed by Hariata with the morning show. Many eclectic personalities and people from different walks of life were involved with shows such as Rosso's Sports show on Saturday Morning, The Gay and Lesbian Show with Mara, and Bute Hewes with morning news and community affairs. It began at the Artworks complex in Oneroa. In 1992, due to an increase in rent, the radio station was forced to move to premises next door at Number 4 Korora Road. Island Radio 93.8FM continued successfully for a number of years reinventing itself as Kaos FM, a heavy metal station and probably the first of its kind in New Zealand. Eventually the frequency was lost due to the tendering process.  Beach FM  Waiheke Radio was preceded by Beach Radio, a radio station situated in the Artworks complex in Oneroa. It was last owned and operated by long-time Auckland radio personality Barry Jenkin who did a breakfast show on the station, and featured a number of community-based shows. The station was run solely by volunteers and broadcast on 99.4FM or on 107FM for the Palm Beach and Onetangi areas. The station is now defunct having lost its frequency in the tendering process in 2008. Island Life, a weekend news and events show on the Beach began to archive some of its broadcasts to ensure availability for years to come on The Internet Archive.Island Live archive Every May, to mark New Zealand Music Month, The Beach presented Live On The Beach, a series featuring Waiheke musicians playing live in the studio. The series was started in 2003 and proved so popular it became an annual event. Throughout the history of Live On The Beach it tried to showcase musicians who don't get the opportunity to perform in front of an audience on the Island whether it be because of their age, or because they are playing music that doesn't fit the solo acoustic blues format favoured by many of the local venues. Most of these performances have been recorded, and many are now available to listen to on the internet or download.Radio Beach BlogRadio Beach Blog In 2006 The Beach launched its very own music awards, The Alternatuis, to showcase alternative artists like Steve Abel, Dudley Benson, Chris Knox and The Mint Chicks. At least two of these artists subsequently placed Alternatui winner stickers on the front of their CD releases.2006 AlternatuisAlternatuis reaction  Waiheke Community Radio Trust  The closure of Beach FM left the island without a radio broadcaster and created the opportunity for the development of a not-for-profit community station on the island. Many former trustees and hosts formed a new trust to start a replacement station. The Waiheke Community Radio Trust attended the August 2008 spectrum auction and was bidding on the 99.4 frequency which eventually sold for $380,000, putting it well out of the trust's reach. The successful bidder was World TV Limited, a company that runs a number of Asian- language TV and radio stations. The $380,000 paid for the frequency was the second highest sum paid for any frequency in the country in this auction round.Provisional results of the auction and settlement processes - NZ Ministry of Economic Development, Auction 10 Archived documents The last Waiheke Island frequency auctioned, in 2003, also went for a very large sum, $378,000. The effect of the high prices paid was that Waiheke interests were priced out of the market as there is not sufficient population to support either a commercial or non-commercial operation that had to recover such an amount.  Modern station  Waiheke Radio made its first live broadcast on Saturday 28 June 2008 from 7am to 12pm. The station hosted The Classic Gold Breakfast, a nationally networked Saturday morning breakfast show fronted by veteran broadcaster, Chris Diack who was visiting the island and worked with the Waiheke Radio volunteers to broadcast his breakfast show from the studio in Artworks. The show featured a number of local people, including students from Waiheke Primary School.First live broadcast from Waiheke Radio will go nationwide The official opening of the radio station was 25 October 2008 and the station is now broadcasting a variety of specialist music and interview style shows. Among these shows is the Hour of Power, presented by Raz Chianti and Jahn Vann, The Hour of Power broadcasts on Tuesday evenings at 7.30pm.

It was first published in the Civil and Military Gazette on December 7, 1886, and in book form in the first Indian edition of Plain Tales from the Hills in 1888. It also appears in subsequent editions of that collection. The story is one of Kipling's reflections on relations between the English settlers, representing the British Raj, and the native population. As so often, there is no clear-cut schematic version of the rights and wrongs - as Kipling himself says in the last sentence of the story, \\"Which is manifestly unfair.\\" The 'unfairness' is that a worthless man is loved by two women, for no reason apparent to outside observers. Phil Garron is an Englishman who has been sent out \\"to 'tea'\\". (This was a form of disgrace for the ruling class in Britain: those who failed, like Garron, in the home country were sometimes sent out 'to the Colonies' to try to redeem themselves.) Garron, who \\"was really going to reform all his slack, shiftless ways\\" leaves Agnes Laiter heartbroken behind him. He is a man of weak character, but he settles into decent (if not exceptional, as he believes) competence - and as he works, forgets Agnes, other than as a daydream. Her family bring pressure on her, successfully, to marry another (a 'better prospect' than Garron): she writes to Garron to tell him, saying \\"she would never know a happy moment all the rest of her life. Which was a true prophecy.\\" (Kipling here shows his deft touch with at least seemingly mature psychological insight, and deft narrative detail.) Garron replies with a carefully drafted letter, which ordinary men might have called \\"the thoroughly mean and selfish work of a thoroughly mean and selfish man\\": but it makes Agnes cry; and Garron (in Kipling's ironic phrase) \\"felt every word he had written for at least two days and a half.\\" He takes up shortly after with a Hill-woman called Dunmaya, the daughter of a senior soldier among the troops of the Native Army and marries her. Agnes, now widowed, finds herself in Bombay and seeks Garron out. She finds him \\"very little altered, and Dunmaya was very nice to her.\\" The shame, and unfairness, is first, that Phil, who really is not worth thinking of twice, was and is loved by Dunmaya, and more than loved by Agnes\\", and second, that \\"Dunmaya [the 'mere' native] is making a decent man of him [the 'white man']; and he will ultimately be saved from perdition by her training.\\" So it is clear that Kipling is neither a simple misogynist, nor a simple race supremacist. :All quotations in this article have been taken from the Uniform Edition of Plain Tales from the Hills published by Macmillan & Co., Limited in London in 1899.

He was part of the first player trade between the New York Mets and New York Yankees that did not also involve a third team. Draft Staiger was born & raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and was a standout athlete at Will Rogers High School. He was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the fifteenth round of the 1969 Major League Baseball Draft, but opted to attend Bacone College in nearby Muskogee, Oklahoma, instead. Seven months later, he was drafted by the New York Mets in the first round (24th overall) of the 1970 January Secondary Amateur Draft. Minor League career After a subpar first season with the California League's Visalia Mets in (.239 avg., 7 HR, 34 RBI in 76 games), Staiger displayed the power that led the Mets to make him a first round pick his second season in Visalia. In 139 games, he clubbed nineteen home runs & eighteen doubles, while driving in 83 runs with a .282 batting average & .445 slugging percentage. As a franchise, the Mets were notoriously unstable at third throughout their brief history. This improved production prompted the Mets to use Staiger, who had split the 1970 season pretty evenly amount second, third & shortstop, primarily at third base in . Likewise, he was used exclusively at third in with the double A Memphis Blues. Injuries limited Staiger to just 81 games, in which he hit three home runs & once again batted .282 with 38 runs batted in. His slugging percentage dropped to .379, and he registered an on-base percentage of .306. Staiger would spend the next three seasons stuck at triple A. In , his first season with the International League's Tidewater Tides, he appeared in 136 games. He had a batting average of .249, a slugging percentage of .339 and an on-base percentage of .302. Although the Mets had several injuries to their infielders on the Major League team, Staiger was passed up in favor of other Tidewater infielders ‚Äî Brian Ostrosser & Lute Barnes ‚Äî and did receive time in the majors that season. In , he again played in 136 games, and improved his batting average to .272, his slugging percentage to .343 and his on-base percentage to .343. In his third consecutive season at Tidewater in , he improved his batting average and slugging percentage again to .282 and .418, respectively. This earned Staiger a promotion to the Mets major league team that September. New York Mets When Staiger made his major league debut on September 12, against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium, he became the fiftieth third baseman in Mets history. He went 0-for-4 in his debut, however, the following day, he got his first major league hit, a double off Cards closer \\"The Mad Hungarian\\" Al Hrabosky, and scored his first major league run on a Mike Phillips single the next batter. He collected just two more hits, both singles, over the rest of the season, giving him three hits in nineteen at bats for a .158 batting average. Staiger began the season in a platoon with Wayne Garrett at third until midway through the season, when Garrett was dealt to the Montreal Expos with Del Unser for Pepe Mangual and Jim Dwyer. At the time of the trade, Staiger was batting an even .200 with no home runs & six RBIs in 34 games, however, Mets manager Joe Frazier had managed Staiger at Tidewater the previous season, and believed in Staiger's ability to serve as the Mets' full-time third baseman. He showed modest improvement following the trade, batting .230 with twenty RBIs over the rest of the season. He hit his first career home run off Expos pitcher Woodie Fryman on August 2. Three days later, he hit his only other home run of the season off the Pittsburgh Pirates' Kent Tekulve. After the Mets got off to a 15-30 start, Frazier was fired as manager, and replaced with player/manager Joe Torre. Under Frazier, Staiger was the Mets' starting third baseman, and batted .236 with two home runs & eight RBIs. Torre, however, favored Lenny Randle, acquired from the Texas Rangers earlier in the season. Staiger garnered just two more plate appearances before being demoted to Tidewater. In 73 games with Tidewater he batted .287 with fifteen home runs to earn a call back up to the Mets that September. In fifteen at bats, he collected six hits, three RBIs & three runs scored. New York Yankees During the 1977 Winter Meetings, Staiger was traded by the Mets to their cross-town rival New York Yankees in exchange for shortstop Sergio Ferrer. Staiger spent the entire season with the Yankees' triple A affiliate, the Tacoma Yankees. Though he batted .283 with nineteen home runs & 85 RBIs, it was not enough to earn him a call up to the World Series champions that September. He did, however, receive a brief call up to the Yankees in September . In his second game as a Yankee, Staiger missed a hit & run call, resulting in a triple play. He appeared in four games for the Yankees, getting three hits in eleven at-bats. In Staiger played once again for the Columbus Clippers. After batting .234 in 90 games, he ended his professional baseball career.

He is known primarily for his paintings, which typically depict stories from Persian mythology and literature, and express oriental mysticism. He has also produced a number of wall tapestries that, like his works on canvas, demonstrate his own instantly recognisable visual language. Biography Ferdowsi and His Mythos, c.1980s, Vienna, Private Collection. Oil on canvas, 200 x 150 cm. Alivandi was born in Fars Province in the South of Iran in 1928. He gained his artistic training in Tehran, initially at the Kamal-ol-Molk Academy of Art, then under the tuition of French masters at Tehran's School of Fine Arts (closely modeled on the French √âcole des Beaux- Arts), from which he graduated with distinction. He completed a further degree in painting at the College of Decorative Arts, Tehran. In 1959 he was appointed by the Ministry of Education, teaching painting at the Workshop of National Art and the Kamal-ol-Molk Academy of Art, a post that he held for 20 years. During this time he practiced a variety of traditional Persian arts such as the Miniature, Ceramics, Tapestries, and Silversmithery. During this time Alivandi was one of Iran's leading modernists, but he left Iran several years after the Islamic revolution of 1979 to escape the repression and censorisation of all free artistic expression. Alivandi joined the National Council of Resistance of Iran in 1994 and was a member of the Council until his death on May 12, 2012. He lived and worked in Vienna from 1983 to 2012. Alivandi belongs to a respected generation of Iranian artists who are important figures in contemporary Iranian art, including Massoud Arabshahi, Nasser Ovissi, and Parviz Tanavoli, to all of whom he is well known. Artistic style Simorgh (The Conference of the Birds), c.1980s, Vienna, Private Collection. Oil on canvas, 200 x 150 cm. Alivandi's work is rich in symbolism and oriental motifs, such as the fish, gazelle, and horse, which are traditional motifs of Persian miniatures. He is influenced by Persian culture, depicting characters and stories from legends and epic poetry by important figures like Ferdowsi and Farid ad-Din Attar. Outstanding works include a series of large-scale oil paintings executed in the 1980s which depict such important figures as Mithra, Jesus Christ, the Simorgh, and Ferdowsi himself. Some of his work is influenced by the war situation and the repression of his native Iran, and expresses the pain and suffering of his people. In terms of technique his work is at times traditional and at times highly original. Alivandi's early paintings, including those from the 1980s, use the now- traditional medium of oil on canvas, yet his aesthetic style, which recalls the stained glass of medieval churches, is highly personal. During the 1990s Alivandi continued to work in oils, but abandoned the traditional canvas, choosing instead to apply his paints directly to newspaper; a method pioneered by the cubists in the early 1900s. Since circa 2000, he increasingly works with the angelique pointillage technique (as seen in the adjacent image), a unique method of painting with extremely small dots of ink which are then covered with a layer of veneer to lock and intensify the colours. This innovative pointillist technique has resulted in the many striking works that demonstrate the beauty of his composition and the power of his vision. According to one critic, his masterful blending of hues has earned him the title \\"the magician of colours\\".'Un Grand Peintre en Exil: Bahram Alivandi', Bulletin du Comit√© d'Amiti√© Franco-Iranien (Janvier 2008): p. 4.

Following the exhibition, in January 2008, a French article entitled 'Un grand peintre en exile' ('A great painter in exile') wrote that Alivandi's \\"synthesis of European training with sixty years of artistic experience derived from a deep knowledge of Persian art and spirituality, has resulted in the creation of a new genre that is unique to him.\\" This critic also noted that Alivandi's paintings represent a \\"paradise of dots\\".

Telfer was previously the state's most isolated town, located north-east of the state capital Perth.

History Newmont Mining first made a claim to the deposit in 1972;The Australian Mines Handbook: 2003-2004 Edition, page 128, accessed: 27 January 2010 however, this is disputed by Jean-Paul Turcaud to this date.The Golden Riddle: Finder's Keepers?

Telfer, a former under secretary for mines in Western Australia. The town grew to a peak of almost 1,000 inhabitants in the early 1990s, with services like a supermarket, a police station, a bank, a community hall, a library and a number of sporting facilities being available.Mining towns of Western Australia, page: 33-34 Plaque at Telfer, Western Australia The mine opened in 1977 as a joint venture between BHP Billiton and Newmont Mining. In 1990, a merger between Newmont Australia Limited and BHP Gold Limited resulted in the creation of Newcrest Mining, with ownership of the Telfer Mine now lying with Newcrest.History of NCM Newcrest website, accessed: 27 January 2010 Telfer's demographic characteristics were typical of a northern Western Australian mining town in the time period. It had a male to female ratio of 2.4 to 1 and almost 40 percent of its population was born overseas. Half its population was below the age of 35 and the town experienced an annual population turnover of almost 20 percent. In 1996, the town suffered the decision to move the Telfer mine from residential to a fly-in fly-out workforce. Many of the commercial services were withdrawn; only the recreational facilities were maintained. The existing housing was now used for the accommodation of the mine's mobile work force. One of the main reasons for the town's closure was that fly-in fly-out rosters gave the mine access to a larger skilled work force and to people that would otherwise have been unwilling to relocate to a remote location like Telfer. Open-cut mining was suspended in August 2000 due to high operating costs. High production costs were primarily caused by the presence of cyanide soluble copper in the open pit ore. In 2002, Newcrest Mining announced a new redevelopment project worth $1 billion, after discovering new mineral areas and a reserve base of some of gold and of copper. The mine reopened in November 2004, after commissioning of the processing plant and, initially as an open cut mine, from March 2006 also with an underground operation.Operations - Telfer Newcrest website, accessed: 27 January 2010 Climate Telfer has a semi arid climate with extremely hot summers and warm winters. Summer highs average at and winter highs at . It receives an average annual rainfall of approximately , despite the fact that it lies relatively close to the Indian Ocean. This location leaves the community vulnerable to tropical cyclones. For example, Cyclone Graham affected the area in early 2003, delivering of rain. Severe Tropical Cyclone Laurence also passed over the mine site in December 2009.

Raised in May 1942 as the 2/6th Independent Company, the 2/6th's main role was to conduct irregular type warfare including small scale raiding, sabotage, long- range patrolling and reconnaissance operations rather than the traditional commando type direct action operations. As such, for the most part the unit conducted operations in small groups operating inside enemy territory, or out in front of larger friendly forces. Between 1942 and 1945, the 2/6th undertook four major campaigns during the war‚ÄîKokoda, Buna, Markham‚ÄìRamu and Borneo‚Äîand was involved in arguably one of the most spectacular small unit actions of the war during the Battle of Kaiapit. The unit was disbanded in January 1946, following the cessation of hostilities in the Pacific. History Formation and training, 1942 The 2/6th Independent Company was formed in May 1942 at the Guerrilla Warfare School at No. 7 Infantry Training Centre at Tidal River, on Wilsons Promontory in Victoria,Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 1. in response to recommendations made by the British Military Mission in Australia, headed by Lieutenant Colonel J.C Mawhood.Horner 1989, p. 21. The company was formed from volunteers from all branches of the Army, and like all of the Independent Companies, it was organised under the philosophy that it had to be a self-sufficient force. As such, it was to be a complete and powerful organisation with its own organic signals, engineering, transport, quartermaster and medical support.Bradley 2004, p. 13. The company had a strength of 20 officers and 275 men (larger than a typical infantry company) and was divided into a headquarters and three platoons, with each platoon consisting of 75 men, commanded by a captain, with three sections below that, each commanded by a lieutenant. As firepower was deemed to be an essential element of the company's ability to conduct successful operations within the context as a raiding force, there was an abundance of automatic and section support weapons, including 0.303 Lee‚ÄìEnfield sniper rifles (SMLEs), Bren light machine guns (LMGs), 2-inch mortars and Thompson and Owen submachine guns, to the extent that in battle each platoon could provide a level of firepower equivalent to that of an infantry company.Trigellis-Smith 1992, pp. ix‚Äìx. alt=A panoramic view of a military camp at the base of a mountain The terrain surrounding the training area at Wilsons Promontory consisted of a number of high, rugged and heavily wooded mountains, swift streams and swamps. It was considered ideal for the six-week training course that the first members of the 2/6th had to endure before they were deployed operationally. Initially training stores were scarce, particularly signalling and engineering stores, and as such there was at first a large focus upon physical training. Training was conducted six days and five nights a week and it was a long, gruelling course. As a result, after the first week, 32 men from the initial intake of 300 were removed from training as being unsuitable.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 2. On 6 June 1942, Major Harry Harcourt assumed command of the company. An Englishman by birth, but a naturalised Australian, he had had considerable experience serving with the British Army in the First World War, in the Russian Civil War and in India before he had settled in Tasmania. Although 47 years old, he was also an accomplished boxer, having been a champion in the Services competition while serving in the British Army, and was, according to author Syd Trigellis-Smith, renowned for his \\"...physical fitness, boundless energy and love of front-line service\\".Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 5. Harcourt set upon the task of preparing the company, although initially he too was frustrated in his efforts by the problem with insufficient training supplies and equipment. Nevertheless, through the rest of June and into July, the training was intensified and all ranks received basic infantry training (as some were not yet infantry trained), and they became proficient in fieldcraft, signalling and demolitions and a number of field exercises were carried out to test their skills.Trigellis-Smith 1992, pp. 5‚Äì10. In July, the company moved north by train to Townsville in Queensland under tight security, bringing all their stores and equipment with them. During this time the company was camped at the Cluden Racecourse. Finally, the order for the company to deploy to New Guinea was received, and despite a refusal by dock workers to load their stores, by 10:30 hours on 2 August 1942, they had embarked on the MS Tasman after the company's engineer section took over the operation of the ship's loading equipment.Trigellis-Smith 1992, pp. 10‚Äì11. Papua New Guinea, 1942‚Äì1943 alt=Soldiers wearing slouch hats and shorts wade along a watercourse In early August 1942, the 2/6th arrived in Port Moresby to take part in the New Guinea campaign. Originally it was intended that they would be been flown from there to Wau, to reinforce the 2/5th Independent Company; however, due to the deteriorating situation in the Owen Stanley Ranges, they were sent to the Kokoda Track instead.Trigellis-Smith 1992, pp. 11‚Äì12. Placed under the command of the 7th Division's headquarters, on 28 August 1942, the company moved up to Mount Eirama where they were employed as the divisional reserve. As the situation along the track continued to worsen for the Australians, the 2/6th moved to cover the Goldie River Valley in order to block any Japanese outflanking manoeuvres.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 14. Long distance patrols were undertaken between 6 September and 12 October 1942 to cover wider lines of possible Japanese approach through the Yodda Valley, the jungle tracks around Esau Creek and the Brown River, and along Engineer Road in support of Honner Force.Trigellis-Smith 1992, pp. 12‚Äì16. The purpose of these patrols was to obtain topographical information regarding the tracks in the area which might be used by Australian forces to outflank Japanese positions, as well as to provide early warning of any infiltration attempts.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 12. To this end, the patrols varied in size and duration, ranging from four or five men to 150 and from five to six days up to months. In some cases they acted as independent, long-range patrols, while others were in close contact with regular formations. On 14 October 1942, elementsA and D Patrols were still in the Kokoda area at this time, as well as Y Patrol which was heading to Yodda River. As such, just over 100 men arrived at Wanigela at this time. See Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 82. of the 2/6th were flown from 14-Mile Drome across the mountains to Wanigela Airfield, Wangiela.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 81. From Wanigela the company moved to Pongani. With the offensive started in the Battle of Buna‚ÄìGona, the 2/6th patrolled in front of the United States Army's 1st Battalion, 126th Infantry Regiment, along the coast from Pongani to Buna.McCarthy 1959, p. 360.Milner 1957, p. 176. Arriving at the front line at Buna on 20 November 1942, the 2/6th was engaged in the heavy fighting around the New Strip airfield until the early December 1942 during which time they were employed mainly in a traditional infantry role.Trigellis-Smith 1992, pp. 97‚Äì119. In mid-December, the 2/6th was withdrawn to Soputa and then Port Moresby, where they spent Christmas prior to returning to Australia for re-organisation and refurbishment.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 126. Re-organisation, 1943 The 2/6th returned to Australia in March 1943 and after some leave, re-assembled at the Army‚Äôs Jungle Warfare Centre at Canungra, Queensland. As part of a re- organisation that was being undertaken to refocus the Army on jungle warfare, the independent companies were amalgamated together to place them into a regimental structure.Horner 1989, p. 26. In line with this, the 2/6th, along with the 2/3rd and 2/5th Independent Companies, were brought together to form the 2/7th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment,Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 145. which had been formed from the 7th Divisional Cavalry Regiment that had served in the Middle East and New Guinea in 1941 and 1942.Hopkins 1993, p. 108.Handel 2003, p. 147. This was an administrative re-organisation only, as the regiment itself had no operational role;Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 213. however, following this the 2/6th Independent Company became known as the \\"2/6th Commando Squadron\\".Dexter 1961, pp. 565‚Äì566. One of the main changes that occurred as a result of this re-organisation was that the engineer section was deleted from the establishment of the commando squadrons, having previously been an important part of the independent company structure.Triggelis-Smith 1992, p. 213. During this time, while the majority of the squadron was training in Australia, a small group of 2/6th men were sent to Bena Bena plateau in New Guinea in January 1943 to watch for enemy activity in the Ramu Valley and to secure Lutheran missionaries who were believed to have been providing information to the Japanese. This group operated in one or two man teams and were deployed for almost six months.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. x. Markham‚ÄìRamu Campaign, 1943‚Äì1944 The 2/6th sailed from Townsville for Port Moresby in August 1943, and then, in the middle of September it was flown to an area just west of the Leron River, in the Markham Valley for the upcoming Markham‚ÄìRamu campaign.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 161. Attached to the 7th Division, the squadron provided flank protection during the campaign, mainly carrying out reconnaissance and long range patrols, although they were also used to capture and hold ground in advance of the main formation at times. alt=A soldier lies postrate on the ground at the base of a palm tree in a clearing with some huts Now made up of a cadre of experienced and fully trained soldiers, the squadron performed with considerable distinction in this campaign, and was involved in arguably one of the most significant small unit actions of the campaign at the Battle of Kaiapit where, on 19‚Äì20 September 1943, it captured the village and then repelled a determined enemy counterattack by a force much larger than its own, until relieved. After the action, 214 Japanese bodies were counted, and it was estimated that another 50 or more lay dead in the tall grass. Abandoned equipment that was recovered included 19 machine guns, 150 rifles, six grenade throwers and 12 Japanese swords.Dexter 1961, p. 422. Against this, the Australians lost 11 killed and 23 wounded.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 181 & 184. For his leadership during this action, Gordon King was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order. After almost seven months of service in New Guinea, the 2/6th returned to Australia in April 1944, disembarking in Sydney on 12 May 1944. From then until late in the war there was a lull in Australian offensive operations in the Pacific and during this time, the company was based in the Mapee‚ÄìKairi area on the Atherton Tablelands, in Queensland, where it trained and conducted exercises with the rest of the 7th Division in preparation for renewed hostilities in 1945.Trigellis-Smith 1992, pp. 213‚Äì223. This was a period of considerable boredom for many members of the squadron, and there was a rise in disciplinary problems during this time as the only outlet for the men‚Äôs physical energy was sport, training and mounting ceremonial duties.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 223. Finally, in May 1945, after almost a year sitting on the sidelines, the 2/6th received orders for overseas service. On 25 May, they travelled to Redlynch staging camp outside Cairns and embarked five days later on 30 May, on a 14-day voyage to Morotai Island, from where they embarked on Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs) for their final campaign of the war on late in June.Trigellis- Smith 1992, pp. 224‚Äì227. Borneo, 1945 alt=Soldiers in combat equipment with helmets and rifles advance towards a thick cloud of smoke One of the final Australian operations of the war occurred on the island of Borneo in mid-1945, just weeks before the Japanese capitulation. Although the necessity of the campaign has since been called into question,Thompson 2008, p. 475. at the time it was felt that Borneo was strategically important due to its vast oil deposits,There were up to 700 oil wells in existence on Tarakan and before the war the island had produced up to six million barrels of crude oil per year. See Thompson 2008, pp. 477‚Äì478. and numerous airfields and harbours which made it ideal as a springboard for operations in Malaya and Java which were planned for 1946 but which did not in the end eventuate.Thompson 2008, p. 477. WIth that goal, between May and July, the 7th and 9th Divisions made a series of landings on the island. These operations came to be known by the codename \\"Oboe\\". The first landing was made at Tarakan on 1 May by a single brigade, the 26th, from the 9th Division with the task of securing the airfield, while the rest of the division landed at Brunei Bay and Labuan Island later in June. The 7th Division landed at Balikpapan on 1 July 1945, having been given the tasks of securing the port, oil installations and airfields, and then destroying the Japanese forces there. At Balikpapan, that the 2/6th Commando Squadron played its final part in the conflict. For the landing, it was attached to the 25th Brigade and went ashore on the second day of the battle.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 232. Over the course of the following three weeks the squadron supported the 25th Brigade in its advance along the Milford Highway. Among its other tasks, which included its normal role of conducting reconnaissance patrols, it also conducted a number of aggressive fighting patrols and successful ambushes along Pope‚Äôs Track and provided humanitarian assistance to the local inhabitants.Trigellis-Smith 1992, pp. 246‚Äì249. Disbandment, 1946 Following the end of hostilities in the Pacific against the Japanese, there was to be no triumphant return to Australia for the 2/6th as a formed unit. Once the fighting on Borneo had stopped, the company was moved to a camp at Manggar Beach. Here they carried out various garrison duties and settled down to await further orders. On 6 October 1945 the unit was declared surplus to the Army's requirements and slowly its numbers began to dwindle as members marched out.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 259. Some 2/6th men were destined for service with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan or garrison duties elsewhere as there were still many Japanese troops at large, while others, who had earned enough pointsDuring the Second World War the Australian Army, like many others at the time, used a points system to determine a serviceman's eligibility for discharge or repatriation. These points were allocated based upon factors such as time served in a combat zone, overseas service, wounds received and any honours or awards that the serviceman might have received, as well as age and marital status. See Grey 2008, p. 198. to do so were to be demobilised and returned to Australia. General (later Field Marshal Sir) Thomas Blamey, the Commander-in-Chief of Australian Military Forces, inspected the 25th Brigade on 17 October, and then two days later they paraded before the Commander-in- Chief of South East Asia Command (SEAC), Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten who praised them for their turn out and thanked them for their service. On 20 November, the \\"low priority\\" men (those who had served the least amount of time) marched out of the 2/6th to join the 2/27th Battalion, while the higher priority men (those who were eligible for discharge before the others) were sent to the 2/12th Battalion two days later.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 260. This left the squadron with just two officers and 19 men. Together they returned to Australia, arriving in Brisbane on 31 December 1945, and marching to Chermside camp where they conducted the final formalities of disbandment. The unit's last day of service on the Australian order of battle was 15 January 1946, when the final three members, including the acting CO, Captain Gordon Blainey, were dispersed and returned to their states of enlistment for demobilisation. Throughout the course of the war, the 2/6th lost 58 men killed in action or died of wounds, while a further 80 were wounded in action. Members of the squadron received the following decorations: one Distinguished Service Order,Captain G.G King, action at Kaiapit, New Guinea, 20 September 1943. See Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 276. two Military Crosses,Lieutenant R.T Balderstone, action at Kaiapit, New Guinea, 20 September 1943 and Lieutenant C.H Ball, action at Balikpapan, Borneo, 15 July 1945.

Gireesh Kumar and directed by Akku Akbar. The film stars Jayaram, Gopika and Nivetha Thomas in the lead roles. The film was a commercial success at the box office. For her role, Nivetha Thomas received Kerala State Film Award for Best Child Artist that year. Gopika also received the Asianet Film Award for Best Female Actor. Plot Sugunan (Jayaram) is a husband who habitually underestimates his wife Bindu (Gopika) in managing a family. Sugunan wants his wife only to keep house - cook food for him, iron his clothes and clean the house. Even after a long tiring day for Bindu, who does all these and more, but, there's never a word of appreciation or a compliment from her husband. He doesn't even acknowledge the work that she is doing without any rest in her life. This often results in quarrels between them, but like any docile Indian wife, Bindu tolerates it for some time. Sugunan is also indifferent (and possibly hostile) to Bindu's family - even though her father makes many attempts to get close to him. Bindu is upset at his behaviour. When he has the electricity supply to her father's house shut down since they were drawing power from the electrical grid, during her brothers wedding,Bindu misunderstands. Later, during a trip to Kodaikanal, Sugunan doesn't \\"allow\\" Bindu to indulge in normal tourist activities like train rides etc. Sugunan's indifference when Bindu's mother dies drives her the point that she is just a non-entity in her husband's life. Once Sugunan slaps her in a fit of rage and she decides enough is enough and goes back to her house. A boy persuades Sugunan's teenage daughter Anjana (Nivetha Thomas) to go for a drive with him, and the jeep breaks down. Some thugs chance upon the hapless girl and try to molest her. The police arrive and rescue the two youngsters. Alarmed by the situation, Sugunan and Bindu are reunited and live happily ever after.

Wood's replaced Laurie Lawrence in Townsville in the early 1970s and notable swimmers coached included Lesleigh Harvey and Michelle Pearson. His first major coaching appointment was on the 1982 Commonwealth Games swim team. Wood coached at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) from 1983 to 1985. He left the AIS to coach at the De Las Salle College at Scarborough, Brisbane. In 2001, he moved to the Redcliffe Memorial Pool. During his coaching career, his swimmers won 85 National Championships and 152 Age Group National Championships, won a total of 61 international gold medals, broke 15 World Records, and 110 Australian Records. Wood served on seven Olympic campaigns: 1988 in Seoul, 1992 in Barcelona, 1996 in Atlanta, 2000 in Sydney and 2004 in Athens, 2008 in Beijing and finally 2012 in London. He also coached swimmers on Commonwealth Games teams: 1974 in Christchurch, 1982 in Brisbane, 1986 in Edinburgh, 1990 in Auckland, 1994 in Victoria, 1998 in Kuala Lumpur, 2002 in Manchester and 2006 in Melbourne. Wood trained Chinese swimming champions Liu Zige, Ye Shiwen and other Chinese National Team and Provincial team swimmers at his high performance centre. Liu won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics as well as 3 world medals in the 200m butterfly. Ye won the 200m and 400m medly at the 2012 London Olympics. After Australia failed to win any individual gold medals in swimming at the 2012 London Olympics, Wood criticised the current swimmers, saying that they were \\"fat\\" compared to the Chinese swimmers, and criticised their \\"embarrassing\\" fixation on social media and treating the games like a \\"social gathering\\". After the 2008 Summer Olympics, one of his students, Jessicah Schipper, left him after he sold training programs to Chinese swimmer Liu Zige, who later defeated Schipper in the 200m Butterfly and broke Schipper's world record at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Death Wood retired from coaching at the age of 87 in March 2018 and died on 16 June 2018 at the age of 88.

It premiered on June 2, 2016 at the Los Angeles Film Festival where it won the audience award in the festival's midnight section. Plot Two estranged brothers, Gordon and John Hardesty reunite at their missing father's video store to clean out the property and sell his belongings after he has been missing for seven months. Gordon is reserved and has stayed away from their hometown, while John is a slacker who hangs out with a drifter named Hank. At the end of the day, Gordon goes to their father's house where he is soon joined by his girlfriend, Margot. Margot and Gordon go to a local place for dinner and there they meet John and Hank, the latter of whom makes a few crude comments to Margot, angering Gordon. Gordon and Margot leave to return to his father's home to spend the night. Gordon wakes up all of a sudden at 3:13 hearing a noise and seeing a shadow on the street below. Looking at a shelf in the bedroom, he sees a key labeled \\"Office.\\" The next day, both brothers are back in the store packing up videos when Gordon suggests that they look in their father's office. While searching the office, they find a VCR board game called \\"Beyond the Gates,\\" and the VHS game tape is in the VCR in the office, the last tape their father watched in the office, presumably before he disappeared. They play the tape, and a woman, Evelyn, asks them if they are willing to risk their souls to play the game. A bright flash and odd noise occur, and the brothers turn off the tape. When they go back into the store, a number of hours have passed. That evening, John joins Gordon and Margot for dinner. After they tell her about the game, Margot suggests it would be fun to play it. When they put the tape in, Evelyn instructs Gordon (\\"the blue player\\") to stand in front of the TV, and asks the brothers if they have the courage to do what is necessary to save their father - namely to locate the \\"four keys.\\" The gameboard has four key images at its corners. Disturbed by Evelyn's specific knowledge of them, they once again turn the game off. That evening, Gordon wakes at 3:13 again and goes downstairs to find the TV on with a static screen and he is soon joined by John and Margot. They are concerned enough that they call their friend Derek, a police officer, to have him look at the tape. This time, however, Evelyn just looks around the room when they play the tape, and all that Derek sees is just TV static. Annoyed, Derek leaves. They find a receipt in the game box and decide to go the store where the game was purchased in the morning. The store is an odd occult store run by Elric, an odd mannered man. They ask him about the game, and he informs them that they must play the game to completion once it has started. As they are leaving, John steals a dagger resembling one in one of the game images. As they proceed to play the game again, they are instructed to turn over the first of four large cards. The first card is \\"The Drifter,\\" and they are instructed to dig up \\"The Drifter\\" in the garden and remove the key from his \\"diseased organs.\\" Digging in their backyard, the men find a small tin with a ragdoll inside. At the same time, Hank is harassing his ex-girlfriend in a bar. When John cuts open the doll to take out the key, Hank is simultaneously and mysteriously disemboweled by an unseen force. John removes the key, surprised to find it covered in blood. Realizing what has happened, Gordon panics and turns over the other four cards, which resemble Derek (\\"The Noble\\"), Margot (\\"The Maiden\\") and their dad (\\"The Father\\"). When they put the key on the board, a gate appears in the basement. Later that night when the men turn back on the tape, they are instructed to take the next key from the head of the lawman, telling them they must choose between life and death. Gordon realizes The Maiden is Margot and throws the game in the trash, but the next morning, the gameboard has reappeared set up in the living room. Meanwhile, Margot goes to see Elric, who tells her that the only two paths ahead of them are to play the game or die. She asks if anyone has ever beaten the game, to which he replies, \\"No, but you are welcome to try.\\" He tells her the game always returns to his store every few years or so. Margot asks if the players bring it back, to which he replies they do not return the game. Later that day, Derek attacks them with a shotgun, appearing to be in some sort of daze. As the men dive for cover, Gordon suddenly comes across a small grey plastic head with a key sticking out of it. Reluctant to pull the key, he is forced to do so when Derek points the shotgun at his head. He pulls the small key out of the head, causing Derek's head to explode, revealing the second key. At this point, Gordon goes to be alone, and Margot and John talk about the brothers' childhood. Their mother died in a car accident and their father became an alcoholic after that point, alienating himself from the brothers. Margot reveals that Gordon drank a lot when they first met, but stopped after he accidentally broke her wrist during an argument, vowing to never drink again. With two keys on the board, the brothers return to the basement to find Margot standing in front of the now-glowing gate, holding the third key. Bringing with them the dagger from Elric's store, they find themselves in a parallel dimension. Heading to the basement in this version of the house, they are attacked by ghouls of Hank and Derek. Hank wounds John before Gordon kills both ghouls. His father's ghoul now faces Gordon, and following Evelyn's instructions, he cuts out his father's heart, removing the key, and saving his father's soul. They rush upstairs to place the fourth key on the board, which restores them to their own dimension. Evelyn's last words to the brothers are to stop thinking about the dead, and to think about the living. The film ends with Margot and Gordon leaving, Gordon and John reconciling, and John staying to settle the estate. Two cut scenes show Elric selling the game to a new customer and Evelyn staring at the audience.

Rotten Tomatoes awarded the film an 80% fresh rating. Noel Murray, writing for the Los Angeles Times, said \\"Anyone old enough to feel nostalgic for the era of VHS board games should get a kick out of ‚ÄúBeyond the Gates,‚Äù a horror movie as retro in style as subject matter.\\" Justin Lowe for The Hollywood Reporter said \\"This low-budget horror-comedy co-starring Graham Skipper and Chase Williamson enthusiastically revisits familiar '90s genre conventions.\\" Katie Rife of The A.V. Club gave the film a \\"B\\" rating calling it \\"an odd, sometimes uneasy combination of stylized retro horror and character drama that plays like a game of Exquisite Corpse between the Duplass brothers and Full Moon Pictures. It‚Äôs not intensely scary, but it is faithful to its ‚Äô80s influences, right on down to the deadbeat dad.\\" Dennis Harvey, writing for Variety called it \\"a fun flashback to the era of cheesy direct-to- VHS horror.\\" Kalyn Corrigan Bloody Disgusting said \\"overall, Beyond the Gates is a wickedly fun little trip down memory lane, back into the good ‚Äòol days of 1980s cult classics, like The Gate, From Beyond, and Re-Animator. Its light and playful atmosphere makes it not only one of the most enjoyable films to play at the Los Angeles Film Festival thus far, but also a film that clearly can be watched over and over again, specifically at home, on the couch with friends, a bowl of popcorn, and the lights dimmed.\\" Jake Dee, for JoBlo.com, gave the film a qualified endorsement noting \\"let's be honest, Beyond the Gates isn't a great movie. It's under-resourced, amateurishly acted and a bit slow-going in the beginning.\\" Dee added, \\"For a low-budget indie horror flick, Beyond the Gates is certainly worth checking out, and definitely puts us on alert for what writer/director Jackson Stewart does next.\\" Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times also had problems with the film saying it \\"shows early promise but eventually ends up in the bin of ordinariness.\\" Even though it is a low budget film, it still managed to enter foreign cinemas. GSC Malaysia's prominent decided to bring it to local audiences.

A men's club, \\"The Commercial Amateur Swimming Club\\" commenced in 1913 and the two clubs amalgamated in 1974. A history of the club, \\"A Century of the Natatorial Art, the Commercial Swimming Club 1903 - 2003\\" was written by Barry T Short, being published in Brisbane in 2004 by Media IQ Pty Limited of Southport, funded by the club, Media IQ and the Brisbane City Council, and is available from the club. All of the original records and other photographs and documentation relating to the club's first 104 years in the possession of the Club, were handed to the John Oxley Library, part of the Queensland State Library, in Brisbane by Barry Short, in 2007, to prevent the loss of any of these records as did happen to much of the early records. Additional records relating to each season of the club are being forwarded to the John Oxley Library to continue the recording of the club's history, for the benefit of those writing a history of the club's second 100 years. The beginning of the club in 1903 and after, shows a very different story to the modern swimming scene. The ladies club conducted a 3-mile race in the Bremer River, on 22 March 1913, won by Miss Minnie King. Apparently, in this time period, the QASA regularly conducted 3 mile races in the river for men. Jim Dunning, the men's club's original Secretary tells us that \\"On the Saturday before the three mile swim, the Queensland Ladies Amateur Swimming Association allowed men to be spectators at a ladies carnival for the first time in many years. It was the occasion of the interstate ladies Championship.\\" Another ladies 3 mile race was conducted by Commercial ladies in the following season in 1913. The men's club's first world record holder, James William Thompson, attained it swimming one mile backstroke. He is recorded of being a world record holder early in the men's club's life (from 1913,) and a copy of a Certificate shows he swam a further mile world record on 18 January 1918, swimming the distance in backstroke in 29 minutes, 4 1/5 seconds, at the City Baths, Wickham St., Valley, Brisbane. At that time the baths were covered and were 100 feet long, and were also called the Booroodabin Baths.

Worthington also served as the director of financial and scholarship services at his alma mater, the Kamehameha Schools, from 1974 until 2003. Additionally, Worthington served on the executive board of the Polynesian Voyaging Society and helped to organize the historic Hokule'a voyage from Hawaii to Tahiti in 1975. He also worked behind the scenes at a large number of other important Hawaiian and Polynesian cultural, educational, athletic and political institutions including the Festival of Pacific Arts, the East-West Center, Prince Kuhio Hawaiian Civic Club and Gates Millennium Scholars Program.  Biography  Early life Bob Worthington was born in Laie on the island of Oahu on January 31, 1936. He attended the Kamehameha School for Boys boarding school, from which he graduated from in 1955. Worthington served as President of the student body during his senior year at Kamehameha. He earned a scholarship to Occidental College in California where he received his bachelor's degree in political science. Worthington moved to the Cook Islands, where he married his Cook Islander wife, Jean Rereao Karika Worthington. He and his family returned to Hawaii in 1974.  Career  Worthington was considered to be an advocate of closer cultural ties between Hawaii and other Polynesian island nations, especially the Cook Islands, French Polynesia and New Zealand. He also advocated for a renewed interest in Polynesian and Hawaiian culture, even before the beginning of the Hawaiian Renaissance during the 1970s. Worthington became the director of financial services at the Kamehameha Schools in 1973. He remained in that position until his retirement in 2003. Under Worthington's guidance, the Kamehameha Schools established foreign exchange programs with Polynesian communities in the Cook Islands, New Zealand, American Samoa and French Polynesia. For example, he established links between the Kamehameha Schools and a MƒÅori school in New Zealand. During Worthington's thirty year tenure as financial director, the Kamehameha Schools grew to administer over 15,500 scholastic awards totalling more than $25.4 million. Worthington placed significant importance on the establishment of cultural, political, artistic and economic ties between Hawaii and other parts of the Pacific, particularly Polynesia. During the 1980s, Hawaiians artists were not invited to take part in the Festival of Pacific Arts because Hawaii was considered to be too closely associated only with the United States. Worthington worked behind the scenes to promote the inclusion of Hawaiians in the Festival of Pacific Arts and today Hawaii is a full participant in the event, which takes place every four years.  Honorary Consul of the Cook Islands  Worthington was appointed the honorary consul of the Cook Islands to the United States in 1985. His position, which was based in Hawaii, was formally recognized by the United States Department of State on March 19, 1985. Worthington, in his capacity as honorary consul, helped to promote tourism in the Cook Islands, expand ties with the United States including Hawaii, secure and negotiate landing rights in Rarotonga, and expand the Cook Islander papaya industry. He served as honorary consul for more than twenty years. In early 2008, the Foreign Minister of Cook Islands Wilkie Rasmussen announced the closure of the Cook Islands consulate office in Hawaii, which was held by Worthington, due to rising costs and expenses.  Death  Bob Worthington died in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 14, 2008, at the age of 72. He was survived by his wife, Jean Rereao Karika Worthington; his five children - Teanaroa Paka Nakahili Worthington, Manavaroa Kamaki Worthington, Tapaarii Karika Ki'ilehua Worthington, Tevairangi Marae-Hino Pa'ahana Worthington Lopez and Moana Jean Karika Rule; and five grandchildren. Worthington's funeral and memorial service was held at the Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop Memorial Chapel on the at the Kamehameha Schools in Kapalama, Hawaii. Guests, which included former Cook Islands Prime Minister Geoffrey Henry, came from as far away as New Zealand, Australia, Tahiti and the rest of United States. Worthington's ashes were sprinkled from the Hokule'a into the Pacific Ocean off Waikiki. A separate \\"spiritual ceremony\\" was held in honor of Worthington at the Taputapuatea marae on the island of Raiatea in French Polynesia. Worthington had been best known in French Polynesia for his part in the organization of the first Hawaii to Tahiti voyage of the Hokule'a Polynesian sailing canoe voyage in 1975 through the Polynesian Voyaging Society. Another memorial service was held for local Cook Islanders in Sinai Hall in the Cook Islands. The former Prime Minister of the Cook Islands Geoffrey Henry, who attended Worthington's memorial service in Hawaii, spoke of his contributions to the Cook Islands, \\"Bob was always there, incessantly helpful, with iconic efficiency, grace and enthusiasm. He helped secure the support of the governor of Hawaii, allowing us to establish our first office in the United States.\\" Current Cook Islands Prime Minister Jim Marurai also issued a statement in reaction to Worthington's death saying, \\"‚ÄôBob worked tirelessly for the Cook Islands, ensuring that we took full advantage of the close ties with Hawaii, especially in trade (maile leis), scholarships (University of Hawaii, East- West Center), training and various conferences and workshops.\\"  References   External links  * East West Center: Robert Worthington dies * PIAF says farewell to Robert E.

Whitewater Lake is associated through a flow with Rice Lake. Fish found in the lake include northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, and blue gill. In the winter the lake is strewn with ice shanties when fisherman compete in the Lions Annual February \\"Fish-A-Ree\\". Because of its location near Kettle Moraine State Forest and Natureland County Park, the area is known for biking (on-road and off-road), golf, hiking, camping, hang gliding, cross-country skiing, water skiing, swimming, fishing, and boating. Native Americans once referred to Whitewater as \\"Minneiska\\", now the name of the local Minneiska Ski Team. Heart Prairie Lutheran Church and Cemetery, a 150-year-old pioneer Norwegian church, sits on the shores of the lake. The church, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, is still in its original state and continues to hold summer services by oil lamp. A smaller Whitewater Lake, a Bass Lake, a Round Lake, and a pre-glacial valley preceded the current Whitewater Lake in the same location.Poff, R. J., and Threinen, C. W. Surface Water Resources of Walworth County. Madison: Wisconsin Conservation Department, 1961, p.25.Everts, Baskin and Stewart. Combination Atlas Map of Walworth County. Chicago: 1873. These lakes and the valley were impounded in 1946-47 to create the current lake.Gerald Goddard; Stephen J. Field. Hydrology and Water Quality of Whitewater and Rice Lakes in Southeastern Wisconsin. Madison, Wis.: U.S. Geological Survey (Water Resources Investigations Report 94-4101) 1990-91, pp. 1-3. An attempt had been made to do the same in 1927, but legal action forced removal of impounding gates. Major features of the lake include a length of 2.6 miles, a width of 0.6 miles, a shoreline length of 10.0 miles, a north bay, a south bay, and a central peninsula, a long ridge of gravel and other sediment called an esker, 1.3 miles long, extending from the north of the lake, and topped by Ridge Road. Whitewater Lake has its major streamflow into the lake from Whitewater Lake inlet at the south end of the lake, in the south bay, where there are several springs. Inflow to the lake from this inlet is fifteen percent of the lake inflow. Fifty-seven percent more of the lake inflow is from ground water in the ground adjacent the lake. Precipitation (rain, snow, etc.) accounts for twenty-six percent more of lake inflow. Near-lake drainage of two percent completes the inflow. The lake dam is concrete, about 10 feet wide, and when water crests the dam, it flows into Whitewater Creek, which drains into Rice Lake to the north and west.Goddard & Field, pp. 7, 12, 14, 31.

Billy Pilgrim was based on Vonnegut's comrade-in-arms Edward R. Crone, Jr. Biographical summary Prior story Billy Pilgrim was born in Ilium, New York on July 4, 1922. After Billy graduated from high school, he enrolled in the Ilium School of Optometry. He is tall at 6 feet 3 inches, but weak and skinny at around 140 pounds. He is also friendly and kind toward others, even when others are rude or accusatory towards him. Billy also tries to pass on wise advice or information that he has learned from the Tralfamadorians. Plot summary from Slaughterhouse Five Billy Pilgrim was born in 1922, in Ilium, New York, the only son of a barber there. A few of his childhood memories are shown: such as when his father attempted to teach him to swim by throwing him into the deep end of a pool and a trip to the Grand Canyon when he is twelve. In 1943, 21-year-old Billy Pilgrim was drafted into the Army. He served as a chaplain's assistant in Virginia, and was serving on the front lines in Germany by 1944. At the Battle of the Bulge, Billy is taken prisoner along with fellow soldier Roland Weary. At this moment, Billy becomes \\"unstuck in time\\", and he re-experiences moments from various points in his life, albeit without any control over which moments. Billy and the other prisoners are transported to Luxembourg, where Roland Weary dies of gangrene. Roland's insane friend Paul Lazzaro promises to find and kill Billy Pilgrim some years after the war. By 1945, the prisoners are transported to Dresden to perform \\"contract labor\\". Their living area is an abandoned slaughterhouse called \\"Schlachthof F√ºnf\\" (Slaughterhouse Five). Allied forces bomb the city, and Billy takes refuge in a meat locker. This allows him to survive until the end of the war in May 1945. He is transported from Germany to the United States, receiving an honorable discharge from service in July 1945. A few months after the war ends, Billy is institutionalized with post-traumatic stress disorder and put into psychiatric care to recover. A man named Eliot Rosewater introduces Billy to the novels of an obscure science fiction author named Kilgore Trout. Once Billy is released, he marries Valencia Merble. Valencia's father owns the Ilium School of Optometry, which Billy later attends. In 1947, Billy and Valencia's first child Robert is born, and two years later they have a daughter named Barbara. On Barbara's wedding night, Billy is captured by an alien space ship and taken to a planet billions of miles away from Earth called Tralfamadore. On Tralfamadore, Billy meets a motion picture star, also abducted, named Montana Wildhack, who disappeared and is believed to have drowned herself in the Pacific Ocean. She and Billy fall in love and have a child together. Billy is sent back to Earth to relive past or future moments of his life. In 1968, Billy is the only survivor (or one of two survivors, depending on the telling) of a plane crash. Valencia dies of carbon monoxide poisoning while driving to the hospital where Billy is being treated. Billy returns to his home in Ilium, and tells his daughter Barbara about the Tralfamadorians, but she believes him to be crazy. By 1976, Billy is 54 years old. He gives a speech to a convention in Chicago (which is now part of a separate country due to the United States having been divided into small, fractious sovereign countries) about his alien abduction. Billy also tells the crowd that Paul Lazzaro, a man he knew during the war, is going to murder him. The crowd begins to protest and does not want the killing to take place. Billy then says, \\"If you protest, if you think that death is a terrible thing, then you have not understood a word I've said.\\" Billy Pilgrim is later assassinated by Lazzaro or someone hired by Lazzaro. Film, TV or theatrical portraits In the 1972 film Slaughterhouse-Five, Billy Pilgrim was portrayed by Michael Sacks. In the play adaptation by Eric Simonson, directed by Joe Tantalo, Billy Pilgrim was played by Gregory Konow. The operatic adaptation by Hans-J√ºrgen von Bose,\\"Hans-J√ºrgen von Bose\\", German Wikipedia premiered July 1996 at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich; Billy Pilgrim II was sung by Uwe Schonbeck.

Biography  Epiphanes was the first-born son and child to King Antiochus IV of Commagene and Queen Iotapa of Commagene. His parents were full-blooded siblings. His parents were Roman Client Monarchs of Commagene who lived under the Roman Empire in the 1st century. His younger siblings were prince Callinicus and princess Iotapa. He was of Armenian, Greek and Median descent. Through his ancestor from Commagene, Queen Laodice VII Thea, who was the mother of King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene, he was a direct descendant of the Greek Syrian Kingdom, the Seleucid Empire. He was most probably born in Samosata, the capital of the Kingdom of Commagene, or in Rome. However, he was raised and educated between Rome and Samosata. His mother died around 52 and his father raised him. Epiphanes was named in honor of his father, his ancestors and the late Roman Client King Archelaus of Cilicia. Antiochus IV was an ally to the Roman Emperors and various members of the Herodian Dynasty. Epiphanes was betrothed in 43/44 to the princess Drusilla, who was a daughter of Judean King Agrippa I. Agrippa thought that Epiphanes would embrace Judaism and Jewish customs. However, Epiphanes never married Drusilla because he refused to adopt the customs and religion of the Jews. The marriage between Epiphanes and Drusilla had not been contracted on the death of Agrippa I. In 64, Epiphanes had married an Egyptian Greek woman from Alexandria called Claudia Capitolina. Capitolina came from a distinguished family. She was the only child of Tiberius Claudius Balbilus by his unnamed wife. Balbilus was an Egyptian Greek who was one of the highest magistrates of Equestrian rank in Rome. Balbilus was an astrologer, a learned scholar who was later prefect of Egypt. Capitolina was distantly related to Epiphanes. Capitolina‚Äôs paternal grandmother princess Aka II of Commagene was a direct descendant of King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene, as she was a great-granddaughter of Antiochus I Theos. Capitolina is not mentioned by Roman sources, however she has been identified as the wife of Epiphanes and mother of Epiphanes‚Äô children, through surviving honorific inscriptions and poetry dedicated to her. After Epiphanes married Capitolina, they settled and lived in the court of Antiochus IV. In 65 Capitolina bore Epiphanes their first son and child, Gaius Julius Antiochus Epiphanes Philopappos in Samosata. In 70 Epiphanes was sent by his father with troops to command and assist the prince Titus to end the siege in Jerusalem. During this war, Epiphanes had met the Roman Jewish historian Josephus. The Roman Emperor Vespasian had stated then that the Kingdom of Commagene was one of the richest of the tributary kings. In 72 Lucius Caesennius Paetus, the Roman Governor of Syria had sent letters addressed to Vespasian accusing Antiochus IV, Epiphanes and his brother Callinicus in planning to revolt against Rome and allying themselves with the King of Parthia. Paetus had accused Antiochus IV, Epiphanes and Callinicus of disloyalty to the Emperor in these letters. It is not known whether these accusations were true or false. After reading the letters, Vespasian felt that he could longer trust the family of Antiochus IV and could not trust them to protect the strategic crossing at the Euphrates River at Samosata. Vespasian gave orders to Antiochus IV to terminate his rule in Commagene. Paetus invaded the Kingdom of Commagene, as head of the Legio VI Ferrata. The client Kings Aristobulus of Chalcis and Sohaemus of Emesa also supplied troops to Paetus. They all arrived the night before the battle. As Epiphanes and Callinicus prepared themselves that night for war, Antiochus IV was preparing to flee to Cilicia. The morning that the war was supposed to occur, Epiphanes, his family and Callinicus, out of fear of the Romans, fled to the King of Parthia, while Antiochus IV also out of fear of the Romans fled to Cilicia. There is a possibility that Epiphanes and Callinicus had a short-lived attempt to resist invasion, before they fled to Parthia. The family of Antiochus IV had let their own army and the citizens of Commagene down. Antiochus IV and his family never considered a war with Rome and they wanted to clear themselves of these accusations. Vespasian brought Epiphanes, with his family and Callinicus, peacefully back to Rome with an honourable Roman military escort. Epiphanes lived in Rome with his family and Callinicus, and Antiochus IV, for the remainder of his life. Vespasian had given Antiochus IV and his family sufficient revenue on which to live. Antiochus IV and his family had a glamorous life and were treated with great respect. They never returned to Commagene, which was reinstated again as a part of the Roman Province of Syria and there the citizens still proved to be loyal subjects of the Roman Empire. In 72 Capitolina bore Epiphanes another child, a daughter named Julia Balbilla in Rome. After the death of his father, Epiphanes and his family moved and finally settled in Athens Greece, where he died in 92. It is unknown whether Callinicus had travelled with them. After his death, Capitolina returned and lived her remaining years in Alexandria, while her son remained in Athens where he became a prominent citizen. His daughter Julia Balbilla became a prominent poet and became a travelling friend to the Roman Emperor Hadrian and his wife the Empress Vibia Sabina. In a surviving poem written by Balbilla dedicated to the memory of her parents and her grandfathers, Balbilla describes her parents as ‚Äòpious‚Äô people and writes very highly of her ancestry.

It covers death, rebirth and the Elizabethan concept of sickness as a visit from God, reflecting internal sinfulness. The Devotions were written in December 1623 as Donne recovered from a serious but unknown illness ‚Äì believed to be relapsing fever or typhus. Having come close to death, he described the illness he had suffered from and his thoughts throughout his recovery with \\"near super-human speed and concentration\\". Registered by 9 January, and published soon after, the Devotions is one of only seven works attributed to Donne which were printed during his lifetime. The Devotions is divided into 23 parts, each consisting of 3 sub-sections, called the 'meditation', the \\"expostulation' and a prayer. The 23 sections are chronologically ordered, each covering his thoughts and reflections on a single day of the illness. Famously, the 17th devotion, Meditation XVII, includes the phrases \\"No man is an Iland\\" (often modernised as \\"No man is an island\\") and \\"...for whom the bell tolls\\". The work as a whole is considered similar to 17th-century devotional writing generally, and particularly to Donne's Holy Sonnets. Some academics have also identified political strands running through the work, possibly from a polemic Arminian denunciation of Puritanism to advise the young Prince Charles. Background John Donne, aged about 42 Donne was born in 1572 to a wealthy ironmonger and a warden of the Worshipful Company of Ironmongers, and his wife Elizabeth. After his father's death when he was four, Donne was trained as a gentleman scholar; his family used the money his father had made to hire tutors who taught him grammar, rhetoric, mathematics, history and foreign languages. Elizabeth remarried to a wealthy doctor, ensuring the family remained comfortable; as a result, despite being the son of an ironmonger and portraying himself in his early poetry as an outsider, Donne refused to accept that he was anything other than a gentleman. After study at Hart Hall, Oxford, Donne's private education saw him study at Lincoln's Inn, one of the Inns of Court, where he occupied his time with history, poetry, theology and \\"Humane learning and languages\\". It was at Lincoln's Inn that Donne first began writing poetry, looking upon it as \\"a life-sign or minor irritation\\" rather than something that defined him. In November 1623, Donne fell seriously ill. London was the scene of a 'spotted' or relapsing fever, which hit its victims unexpectedly and left them conscious but physically helpless. What disease Donne suffered from is not known. Writers have suggested typhus as a likely culprit, but Donne's writings on the subject reference multiple diseases. Clara Lander, writing in SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500‚Äì1900, suggests that the typhus may have exacerbated the enteritis Donne had suffered from since childhood. Donne was of the opinion ‚Äì as were many others of the age ‚Äì that illness reflected a state of internal sinfulness, and constituted a visit from God. Despite being ordered to rest, he insisted that a pen and paper be given to him, and he wrote down his impressions of the disease. After his recovery, in December, these became Devotions upon Emergent Occasions, one of his few published prose works, and also one of only seven printed works of which he acknowledged authorship. Written with \\"near super-human speed and concentration\\", the work was registered with the Stationers' Company by 9 January 1624. It was published that year, and again in 1634 and 1638. The full, albeit rarely used, title is Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions, and severall steps in my Sicknes. Contents Structurally, Devotions consists of 23 chronologically ordered sections ‚Äì representing the length, in days, of Donne's illness. Each one contains a 'meditation', in which he describes a stage of his illness, an 'expostulation' containing his reaction to that stage, and finally a prayer in which he makes peace with the disease. In the five editions published during the 17th century, the book opens with a Latin preface, titled \\"Stationes, sive Periodi in Morbo, ad quas referuntur Meditationes sequentes\\". Also 23 sections long, each line of the preface is followed by what purports to be an English translation of the Latin. Joan Webber argues that these lines constitute a poem, in dactylic hexameter; David Novarr disputes this, arguing that Stationes \\"has none of Donne's customary wit, drama, and imagination\\". Instead, it represents the Stations of the Cross, or supplicatio stativa. Mary Arshagouni, writing in Modern Philology, argues that the stationes indeed constitute a poem ‚Äì or, at least, something more than a mere table of contents. The Latin lines play off the English translations, and contain nuanced meaning not found in the English that better represents the sections to which they refer. Following the stationes, the 23 meditations begin. Each section, taken in an isolated way, follows the same pattern: Donne states some element of his illness or treatment, and then expands upon his statement to develop a theme that culminates with him becoming closer to God. Perhaps the most famous of the meditations is Meditation XVII, which begins with the statement: This statement, or title, is then expanded on. Donne first concludes that he may not be aware that the bell is tolling, saying \\"hee for whom this Bell tolls may be so ill, as that he knowes not it tolls for him; And perchance I may thinke my selfe so much better than I am, as that they who are about mee, and see my state, may have caused it to toll for mee, and I know not that\\". This is then expanded with the realisation that, even if the bell is tolling for others, it is a matter of concern for Donne, as: Donne then argues that if someone dies, anyone has the right to use their death as long as they do so valuably, considering it a treasure. He writes that: The death of an individual ‚Äì signified by the tolling of the bell ‚Äì is thus a treasure buried at the bottom of a mine: only of value if it is given to someone who makes good use of it. In this he refers to the work of Augustine of Hippo, specifically On Christian Doctrine, in which Augustine describes the knowledge of pagans as gold and silver: something that can be involved in Christian purposes if appropriated properly. Donne, twisting this idea, is arguing that the death of any individual is something others can learn from, should they understand it properly. Style and meaning Stylistically, the Devotions is an example of 17th-century devotional writing, and has been compared by Roger Rollin, professor of literature at Clemson University, to the Holy Sonnets and considered, in effect, a sequel. In the context of 17th century devotional writing, Rollin uses the Devotions to demonstrate that, in his view, such writings were \\"more public than private, [serving as] vehicles for the diagnosis of spiritual malaise and as sources of remedies\\". Lander argued that the full title signifies \\"growth of the spirit through physical ordeal\\", and in doing so draws on the devotional works of Joseph Hall. Thomas F. Van Laan, writing in Studies in Philology, draws parallels between Donne's style and the Ignatian exercises: a set of structured mental exercises designed to bring an individual closer to understanding God. A number of literary theorists have approached the Devotions as politically themed. Richard Strier, in particular, identifies the Devotions as an \\"Arminian polemic\\", arguing that it was highly atypical of Donne to actually publish works, rather than merely let them circulate amongst friends. Both before and after ordination, Donne actively resisted publication, normally only publishing works that had been the result of a commission, such as The Anniversaries or Pseudo-Martyr. The Devotions, however, were \\"literally rushed\\" into print, with the volume being handed to the printers a month after he had recovered from his disease. Strier argues that Donne's rationale for publishing the Devotions matches his rationale for publishing a sermon, the Encaenia, the same year, to assert the importance of \\"places, and of dayes, and of all outward meanes\\", because he felt some sense of urgency about what he had to say. This is coupled with Devotion XVI, in which Donne explicitly comes out against Puritanism and is simultaneously \\"purposely militant\\", deliberately frustrating the other extreme from Puritanism, where \\"the Arminianism and the polemical anti-puritanism of the volume becomes explicit\\". Dave Gray and Jeanne Shami, writing in the Modern Language Quarterly, argue that it was not just a work of political rhetoric but a work of political advice, aimed at Prince Charles, to whom it was dedicated. The political situation at the time was complex, as King James was ill and Charles attempting to gain control of the government. Gray and Shami highlight the noted line \\"No man is an island\\"; while most interpret it spiritually, they argue that it was a reminder to the prince and his advisors that \\"even private actions have public consequences\\". The veiled nature of the political references was deliberate; it allowed the work to be acceptable to the censors, but accessible to Charles and those close to him. In the event that they rejected the underlying message, it would also be accessible to other prominent and influential political figures. Lander argues that the structure of the work is itself symbolic. As well as the division of the poem into 23 parts, each signifying and describing one day of Donne's illness, each part is itself split in three ‚Äì representing the Trinity. The use of three elements ‚Äì Meditation, Expostulation, and Prayer ‚Äì also matches the three services found in the Book of Common Prayer, a common influence on devotional writers of Donne's era. Critical response The Devotions have received a mixed reaction from critics. Evelyn Simpson described it as \\"a curious little book\\", and wrote that \\"[a]s a manual of devotion [the Devotions] compares unfavourably with the Devotions of Bishop Andrewes or the Holy Living of Jeremy Taylor. It is too introspective, too metaphysical, too much overloaded with learning of different kinds\\". Helen C. White described it as the output of an \\"anxious and restless mind\\". Arshagouni, on the other hand, describes the Devotions as > Donne's most mature, perhaps most complex work: a remarkable, sustained > prose-poem that not only expresses conflicting and powerful internal > emotions but also consciously provides its readers with a touching model of > the experiences of God's elect in confronting the inexorable course of human > sinfulness that characterizes life on earth. Helen Wilcox writes that \\"the mixture of elaborate rhetoric, painstaking argument, and the frank details of his melancholic 'ridling distemper' creates a particularly powerful impact\\" and draws particular attention to Meditation XVII, noting that despite the apparent self-interest of the Devotions, that piece highlights Donne's recognition of the ultimate interconnectedness of humanity. Meditation XVII was also the focus of Robert Jungman, who, writing in American Notes and Queries, noted it as the most forceful statement of Donne's theme in what was ultimately a \\"powerful psychological analysis\\". In wider popular culture, several phrases from the Devotions, particularly Meditation XVII, have become commonly quoted, including \\"No man is an Iland\\" (often modernised as \\"No man is an island\\") and \\"...for whom the bell tolls\\". Thomas Festa, writing in Notes and Queries, identifies similarities between Thomas Browne's Christian Morals and Donne's Meditation XIV.

He was taken prisoner at Fort Washington early in the war and spent several years aboard a prison hulk. After independence, Lingan served as a government official in Georgetown. At the outbreak of the War of 1812, Lingan was an outspoken advocate of freedom of the press and was murdered by a mob while defending the offices of an anti-war newspaper in Baltimore. Military service Lingan enlisted in the Continental Army on July 13, 1776, only nine days after the signing of the Declaration of Independence. He became a lieutenant in the Rawlings Additional Regiment, but was captured at Fort Washington on November 16, 1776. Imprisoned in the hulk HMS Jersey, Lingan was initially kept in a cell in which he could neither lie down nor stand up. Approached by distant cousin Samuel Hood and offered ¬£10,000 and a commission in the British Army if he agreed to switch sides in the conflict, Lingan was reported to have replied \\"I'll rot first\\". Later in his captivity, Lingan gained the reputation as a defender of prisoners' rights. On one occasion, Lingan defended the body of a recently deceased prisoner from guards who wanted to behead the corpse to make it fit into a small coffin. Government service and death Following his release at the end of the war, Lingan was made Collector of the Port of Georgetown by George Washington personally and became a Brigadier-General in the Maryland State Militia. He was also a founding member of the Society of the Cincinnati. He built Prospect House, in Georgetown. Throughout his life, Lingan was a strong advocate of the freedom of the press and, at the outbreak of the War of 1812, spoke out in opposition to those who favoured censorship. When the offices of the Baltimore Federal Republican were besieged and burnt by a mob angry at anti-war editorials run by the newspaper, Lingan protested at the act and sheltered the newspaper editor, Alexander Contee Hanson, in Georgetown. On July 17, 1812, Hanson resumed printing the newspaper at new offices in Baltimore and another mob formed within hours, again storming the building and destroying the presses. Hanson, with Lingan, Henry Lee III and others who had hastened from Washington to try to calm the crowd, were arrested by local militia and taken to Baltimore City Jail in an attempt to calm the situation. The crowd, led by an athletic butcher named John Mumma, followed them to the prison and stormed the building. Lingan attempted to stop the mob by displaying a bayonet wound he had received in the Revolutionary War, but that only inflamed the crowd, and Hanson, Lingan and Lee were severely beaten and left for dead. Hanson and Lee survived although the latter was left partially blinded after hot wax was poured into his eyes. Lingan, however, died from his serious injuries. Lingan was buried at St. John's Church in Georgetown, at a funeral attended by thousands of mourners. George Washington Custis read the eulogy, praising Lingan's defence of free press and crying, \\"Oh Maryland! Would that the waters of the Chesapeake could wash this foul stain from thy character!\\" Lingan's remains were removed from the burial ground 96 years later in Georgetown and transferred to Arlington National Cemetery. In an odd bit of irony, Arlington Cemetery had been established in 1864 on the grounds of the Arlington Plantation, the home of George Washington Parke Custis.Peters, pp. 126‚Äì128 Notes References * External links *James Lingan at Find A Grave Baltimore Riot of 1812 *contemporary account *a summary 1751 births 1812 deaths People from Maryland Continental Army officers from Maryland People murdered in Baltimore Burials at Arlington National Cemetery Murdered American military personnel Deaths by beating in the United States People from Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)

It is a part of the North Shore Mountains, rising from the shores of Indian Arm to a summit of . It is named after nearby Elsay Lake and Creek. These names are thought to derive from a Scottish settler, probably after a place name in Scotland. History A common misconception is that Elsay was originally named Mt Jarrett in honour of George Jarrett, a South African who became the first secretary of the British Columbia Mountaineering Club (BCMC), in 1909. In fact, the name Jarrett was given to a nearby peak to the north which is sometimes called Deacon Peak. The first recorded ascent of Elsay was on May 6, 1923 by a BCMC group of 29 hikers, led by the legendary BCMC Director Tom Fyles (England 1887 - 1979; Mount Fyles near Bella Coola is named in his honour), coming from Seymour and past Runner. Hiking routes Unlike the nearby Mount Seymour, Elsay is not visited by hikers with much frequency. Two routes are most popular; the best hike is to go out by one and return by the other. The West Trail is reached by hiking toward Mount Seymour, then bearing left (west) in the saddle between Second and Third Peaks. A rough route poorly marked with tapes takes one around Mount Seymour's West flank, across the gully below Runner Peak, then trends upward to the ridge, then a rock face to the summit. Alternately, the Elsay Lake Trail takes one to the East of Mount Seymour, across several rock slides, then up a large talus slope (bear right to the low point of the ridge) to join the other trail on the south shoulder of the mountain. The route to Vicar Lakes, Mount Bishop and the Indian Arm Trail heads left shortly after the ridge starts to rise to Mount Elsay. The Peak is flanked by Mount Bishop and Elsay Lake on the North, with Mount Seymour and Runner Peak to the South. This is rough backcountry and should be approached only with caution and experience.

Callinicus was the second-born son and child to King Antiochus IV of Commagene and Queen Iotapa of Commagene. His parents were full-blooded siblings. His parents were Roman Client Monarchs of Commagene that lived under the Roman Empire in the 1st century. His older brother was prince Gaius Julius Archelaus Antiochus Epiphanes and youngest sibling was princess Iotapa. He was of Armenian, Greek and Medes descent. Through his ancestor from Commagene, Queen Laodice VII Thea, who was the mother of King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene, he was a direct descendant of the Greek Syrian Kingdom the Seleucid Empire. Callinicus‚Äô birth name was probably Gaius Julius Mithridates Callinicus. He was probably named in honor of his ancestor King Mithridates I Callinicus, who was the father of King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene. Callinicus is the second person in the Royal Family of Commagene to bear this name. He is simply known as Callinicus. He was most probably born, raised and educated in Samosata, the capital of the Kingdom of Commagene. His mother died around 52 and his father raised him. Unfortunately, more is known on his eldest brother and younger sister, than on Callinicus. In 72 Lucius Caesennius Paetus, the Roman Governor of Syria had sent letters addressed to Vespasian accusing Antiochus IV; Epiphanes and Callinicus in planning to revolt against Rome and allying themselves with the King of Parthia. Paetus accused in these letters that Antiochus IV, Epiphanes and Callinicus of disloyalty to the Emperor. It is not known whether if these accusations were true or false. After reading the letters, Vespasian felt that he could no longer trust the family of Antiochus IV and couldn‚Äôt trust them to protect the strategic crossing at the Euphrates River at Samosata. Vespasian gave orders to Antiochus IV to terminate his rule in Commagene. Paetus invaded the Kingdom of Commagene, as head of the Legio VI Ferrata. The client Kings Aristobulus of Chalcis and Sohaemus of Emesa also supplied troops to Paetus. They all arrived the night before the Battle. As Epiphanes and Callinicus prepared themselves that night for war, Antiochus IV was preparing to flee to Cilicia. The next morning that the war was supposed to occur Epiphanes with his family and Callinicus out of fear of the Romans fled to the King of Parthia, while Antiochus IV also out of fear of the Romans fled to Cilicia. There is a possibility that Epiphanes and Callinicus had a short-lived attempt to resist invasion, before they fled to Parthia. The family of Antiochus IV had let their own army and the citizens of Commagene down. Antiochus IV and his family never considered to cause a war with Rome and they wanted to clear themselves of these accusations. Vespasian brought peacefully back to Rome, Epiphanes with his family and Callinicus in an honourable Roman Military Escort. Epiphanes with his family and Callinicus lived in Rome with Antiochus IV for the remainder of his life. Vespasian had given Antiochus IV and his family sufficient revenue to live on. Antiochus IV and his family had a glamorous life and were treated with great respect. They never returned to Commagene. Commagene was reinstated again as a part of the Roman Province of Syria and there the citizens of Commagene still proved to be loyal subjects of the Roman Empire. After the death of Antiochus IV, Epiphanes and his family moved and settled in Athens Greece. However, it is unknown whether Callinicus had travelled with them. After this moment, nothing more is known on Callinicus. Sources *https://web.archive.org/web/20151227175141/http://www.mavors.org/PDFs/Commagene.pdf *Chahin, Mark (2001). The Kingdom of Armenia.

Biography Early life Louis Joseph Saint-Amans was born on June 12, 1749 in Marseille. Initially studying to be a lawyer, he abandoned his studies to focus on music. Career He travel around southern France with an Italian theater troupe performing opere buffe. He then spent three years in Italy as a tutor to the children of a Swiss baron. Interested in music, he studied the works of Italian composers on his own, ultimately deciding to pursue his own career as an opera composer. He returned to Paris in 1769 and his first op√©ra comique, Dom Alvar et Mincia, d√©buted the following year. He composed several more operas and ballets over the next few years, some of which appeared at the Op√©ra National de Paris. However, none of these works were met with particular success. In 1778, he moved to Brussels to become the conductor of the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie. He finally found success while working in Brussels, enjoying a six-year period of well received compositions. After returning to Paris in 1884, he was appointed professor of singing at the Ecole Royale de Chant (later the Paris Conservatoire). He continued to write op√©ras comiques until the early years of the 19th century, but lack of critical acclaim and a move to Brest (following the loss of his position at the Conservatoire) may have led him to abandon composing for the stage during his last 15 years.

New Haven, Yale University Press, 1929; pp. 32-3. His long career illustrates the conditions during the difficult years of transition from the period of English Renaissance theatre, through the English Civil War and the Interregnum, and into the Restoration era. Early years Baxter worked with Queen Anne's Men through most of that company's existence, from 1606 to 1623. He was paid 10 shillings a week as a hired man; he became a sharer (a partner in the company) in 1623, the year the company folded.C. J. Sisson, \\"Notes on Early Stuart Stage History,\\" Modern Language Review, Vol. 37 No. 1 (January 1942), pp. 25-36. Unfortunately, that company was in financial difficulties for much of its existence; its hired men were sometimes paid half their wages, or less, or nothing. \\"Baxter kept a record of these deficits, which he considered as arrears, but could never recover them from the company.\\"Sisson, p. 35. (Baxter may have received his share in 1623 as compensation for the arrearages.) Baxter was with the King's Men in the years from 1628 to 1637; he appeared in their productions of Ford's The Lover's Melancholy (1628) and Massinger's Believe as You List (1631), and their revival of Fletcher's The Mad Lover, c. 1630. With Baxter as with many other actors of his time, some of the best evidence on his career comes from legal documents. In March 1622, a feltmaker complained that Baxter had wounded him during a performance, while the feltmaker had been seated at the side of the stage. Apparently, nothing came of the man's complaint.John Tucker Murray, English Dramatic Companies, 1558-1642, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1910; p. 197. In the following year, 1623, Baxter gave testimony in a legal suit, the so-called Baskervile or Worth/Baskerville suit, that involved most of the members of his acting troupe. (Baxter's signatures on legal documents, in 1623 and in 1665, prove that the pre-1642 and post-1660 actors are the same man.)C. J. Sisson, \\"The Red Bull Company and the Importunate Widow,\\" Shakespeare Survey, Vol. 7 (1954), pp. 57-66. Dark years From 1642 to 1660, during the years of the Civil War and Commonwealth, the theatres were formally closed. Actors performed clandestinely when they could, though they were repeatedly harassed, arrested, imprisoned, and generally persecuted by the authorities. Legal documents once again throw light upon the careers of Baxter and his fellow actors in these years. Baxter was one of several English actors who performed on the Continent, mainly in The Hague and Paris, in the years 1644 and 1645.Judith Milhous and Robert D. Hume, \\"New Light on English Acting Companies in 1646, 1648, and 1660,\\" Review of English Studies, New Series, Vol. 42 No. 168 (November 1991), pp. 487-509; see pp. 488-91. He was also involved in a 1648 effort to restart the King's Men. In December of that year, Baxter and nine other actors, most of them veterans of the company, signed a contract with an upholsterer named Robert Conway; Conway was to provide financial backing for the group in return for a portion of their income, and the ten would be the sharers or partners in the new version of the old company. This effort produced limited drama but enduring litigation: Conway's heirs sued the actors in 1661, claiming that the 1648 contract granted them a share in the profits of the newly formed King's Company. In the complainants' interpretation, the King's Company was a continuation of the 1648 group, and Conway's contract applied. The resulting suit has been called \\"the Baxter suit,\\" since in some documents Baxter is listed first among the involved actors. Baxter himself gave a deposition in the case in 1665, in which he identified himself as being 72 years old at the time. The documents in the case specify that during the years of the theatre closure the actors often could act only in private homes for relatively small sums; and even then they were sometimes arrested and jailed. The authorities used confiscation of the actors' costumes as an effective means of suppression, since a troupe's stock of costumes constituted its main material wealth and financial investment.Milhous and Hume, pp. 487, 491 and ff. In the Restoration Baxter was one of the thirteen actors who became sharers in the new King's Company when it was organized at the start of the Restoration period. He continued with that organization for the remainder of his stage career. His 1665 deposition indicated that he received a \\"salary,\\" apparently more like a pension, of 20 shillings per week since 1663. He likely died not long prior to 8 February 1668, \\"when his name is cancelled in a livery warrant.\\"Milhous and Hume, pp. 505-6. Baxter was probably the father of two actors of the next generation, John Baxter and another Richard Baxter.

It was during this time that there was a great deal of political complexity seen both in Maya royal houses as well as in the Maya area. Warfare was a significant factor in political competition and marriage was one of the ways that alliances were made between the different polities. This was accompanied by a shift in women's roles from wife and mother to playing integral parts in courtly life, such as participating in rituals involving the supernatural world and at times ruling individual polities. A handful of women are described and depicted on monuments taking on roles and titles that were usually reserved for men.Miller & Martin 2004:93 High-ranking titles that both men and women could hold included Ajaw and Kaloomte º. The title of Ajaw was seen as \\"the most general title\\" that persons of nobility could have if they were born into the right social ranking; meanwhile, the title Kaloomte' has an unclear meaning but it is at the site of Tikal where the title is used as the highest rank.Montgomery 2002:201, 203 Among the high- ranking women in ancient Maya society during the Classic Period were five who rose to the position of ruling queen. Some acceded to the throne in their own right due to the lack of a male heir. Others served as regent until their sons were old enough to rule. These women included Lady of Tikal, Lady Yohl Ik ºnal and Muwaan Mat of Palenque, Lady Six Sky of Naranjo, and Lady Eveningstar of Yaxchilan Tikal Lady of Tikal \\"Lady of Tikal\\" assumed a leadership role at the age of six but did not rule on her own. She co-ruled with an individual named Kaloomte º Bahlam.Martin & Grube 2008:38 The daughter of Chak Tok Ich ºaak II, Lady of Tikal was depicted on Stela 23, which was broken and later re-erected incomplete. Her relationship to Bird Claw, who may have been her successor is unknown due to problems deciphering the text of Stela 8, but it is important to note that Bird Claw does not carry the Tikal emblem.Martin & Grube 2008:39 Monuments that refer to the Lady of Tikal are: Stelae 6, 12, and 23. Palenque Lady Yohl Ik ºnal Lady Yohl Ik ºnal took the throne at Palenque in 583 when Kan Bahlam I, the 7th ruler, died and left no heir. The relationship between her and the previous king remains undetermined, though she appears to have been either his daughter or sister. She ruled for more than 20 years. She also carried full royal titles, an uncommon occurrence for women.Martin & Grube 2008:159 According to the sarcophagus of K ºinich Janaab º Pakal, Yohl Ik ºnal was the mother of Lady Sak K ºuk º, making Lady Yohl Ik ºnal the grandmother of K ºinich Janaab Pakal.Schele & Freidel 1990:221 Lady Yohl Ik ºnal appears on the side of the sarcophagus of K ºinich Janaab Pakal. Muwaan Mat Muwaan Mat (also known as Lady Sak K ºuk º or \\"Lady Beastie\\") ruled for a short time after the death of Aj Ne º Yohl Mat before K ºinich Janaab º Pakal took the throne. It was probably Sak K ºuk º and her consort K ºan Mo º Hix who held most of the power during the childhood of K ºinich Janaab º Pakal.Martin & Grube 2008:161 There is an image of Lady Sak K'uk handing him what had been termed the \\"drum major\\" crown at his accession. Naranjo Lady Six Sky Of the queens, Lady Six Sky's reign was the most impressive. She was the daughter of Bajlaj Chan K ºawiil of Dos Pilas and arrived at Naranjo in the position of ruling queen and established a \\"new dynasty.\\" Lady Six Sky commissioned monuments that note she performed important calendric rituals, some shortly after her arrival.Martin & Grube 2008:74 Additionally, she is shown on monuments taking on the role of a warrior-king by standing over a trampled captive, an unusual representation for a woman. Naranjo Stela 24 is one such depiction.Martin & Grube 2008:74; Miller & Martin 2004:99. Scholars suspect that K ºahk º Tiliw Chan Chaak, the king who succeeded her, was the son of Lady Six Sky. He was born five years after her arrival at Naranjo. Monuments that refer to Lady Six Sky are: Stelae 3, 18, 24, 29, and 31. She died on February 10 or 11, 741. Yaxchilan Lady Ik º Skull Lady Ik º Skull, also known as Lady Eveningstar, came to Yaxchilan from Calakmul. She was a secondary wife to Itzamnaaj Bahlam III (also referred to as Shield Jaguar II, Shield Jaguar the Great or Itzamnaaj B ºalam II).Martin & Grube 2000:122. Note that in Martin and Grube's 2nd (revised) edition of this work (2008), Itzamnaaj Bahlam's position in the dynastic sequence has changed from that given in the original edition, along with a modification to the orthography for his name (Martin & Grube 2008:122). Although a secondary wife, Lady Ik º Skull may have ruled for a short time in Yaxchilan's history until her son Bird Jaguar IV was old enough to take the throne.Josserand 2007 A review of the dynastic history of Yaxchilan during Itzamnaaj Bahlam III's reign indicates that he had three wives: Lady K ºab ºal Xook (also written as Lady Xoc or Lady Xok), Lady Sak B ºiyaan and Lady Ik º Skull of Calakmul, with Lady K ºab ºal Xook as the primary wife.Martin & Grube 2008:126 Upon the death of Itzamnaaj Bahlam, the right to the throne would traditionally go to his heir through the Lady K ºab ºal Xook line; however, this is not what happens and nearly ten years after his death it is his son, Bird Jaguar IV, from Lady Ik º Skull that takes the throne.Josserand 2007:299. There is a great deal of speculation as to why the son of a secondary wife took the throne and did so after the king had been dead for ten years. Current thinking is that the rightful heir through Lady K ºab ºal Xook's lineage may have been her son, or perhaps a nephew or brother,As is suggested by Martin and Grube (2008:127). but that this individual was captured during a conflict with Dos Pilas in 745.Josserand 2007:307. Information regarding this \\"interregnum\\" period tends to be conflicting. In their second revised edition Martin and Grube note that at Piedras Negras there is mention of a new king at Yaxchilan, Yopaat Bahlam II, who may have ruled for part or all of this period.Martin & Grube 2008 However, supporting evidence for this is unknown from Yaxchilan. On the other hand, Josserand notes that Lady Ik º Skull ruled as regent during this time and that it was not until her death that Bird Jaguar IV took the throne. A monument which refers to Lady Ik º Skull is stela 35.

Currently, and from 1992, one of its lines (Northern line) was enabled to function as tourist train called Tren Turistico de la Sabana. History The construction of the Savannah Railway was authorized in 1873 and begun in 1882 by a British company. The works were suspended in 1886 when its length was just 18 km. A new contract was made with an American venture called ‚ÄúSavannah Railway Company‚Äù. When the line was inaugurated its length was 40 km. In 1887 a new contract took place for the construction of the Zipaquira line. In time, the railways expanded across the Bogot√° Savannah reaching a length of about 200 km. In 1917 the Estacion de la Sabana was built by the English engineer William Lidstone; this building served as Central Station for the national railway as well. Its location was on the outskirts of the city on the west (today Calle 13). The last expansion of the Bogot√° Savannah Railway occurred in 1953.

The engagement lasted for more than 15 hours, in an increasing gale and the constant presence of the rocky Breton coast. The seas were so rough that the French ship was unable to open the lower gun ports during the action and as a result could only fire the upper deck guns, significantly reducing the advantage that a ship of the line would normally have over the smaller frigates. The damage the more manoeuvrable British vessels inflicted on the French ship was so severe that as the winds increased, the French crew lost control and the Droits de l'Homme was swept onto a sandbar and destroyed. Background In December 1796, during the French Revolutionary Wars, a French expeditionary force departed from Brest on an expedition to invade Ireland. This army of 18,000 French soldiers was intended to link up with the secret organisation of Irish Republicanism known as the United Irishmen and provoke a widespread uprising throughout the island.Pakenham, p. 24. It was hoped that the resulting war would force Britain to make peace with the French Republic or risk losing control of Ireland altogether. Led by Vice-Admiral Morard de Galles, General Lazare Hoche and leader of the United Irishmen Wolfe Tone, the invasion fleet included 17 ships of the line, 27 smaller warships and transports, and carried extensive field artillery, cavalry and military stores to equip the Irish irregular forces they hoped to raise.James, p. 5. Departure from Brest Morard de Galles planned to sail his fleet from the French naval fortress of Brest under cover of darkness on the night of 15‚Äì16 December.Henderson, p. 21. The British Channel Fleet normally maintained a squadron off Brest to blockade the port, but its commander, Rear-Admiral John Colpoys, had withdrawn his force from its usual station offshore to northwest of Brest because of severe Atlantic winter gales.Woodman, p. 85. The only British ships within sight of Brest were an inshore squadron of frigates under Sir Edward Pellew in , accompanied by , , and the lugger HMS Duke of York. Pellew was already renowned, having been the first British officer of the war to capture a French frigate: the Cl√©op√¢tre at the Action of 18 June 1793. He later captured the frigates Pomone and Virginie in 1794 and 1796, and saved 500 lives following the shipwreck of the East Indiaman Dutton in January 1796. For these actions he had first been knighted and then raised to a baronetcy. Indefatigable was a razee, one of the largest frigates in the Royal Navy, originally constructed as a 64-gun third rate and cut down to 44 guns in 1795 to make the ship fast and powerful enough to catch and fight the largest of French frigates. Armed with 24-pounder cannon on the main decks and 42-pounder carronades on the quarter deck, she had a stronger armament than any equivalent French frigate.Woodman, p. 65. Sir Edward Pellew by Thomas Lawrence, 1797 Observing the French fleet's departure from the harbour at dusk, Pellew immediately dispatched Phoebe to Colpoys and Amazon to the main fleet at Portsmouth with warnings, before approaching the entrance to Brest in Indefatigable with the intention of disrupting French movements.Woodman, p. 84. Believing that the frigates in the bay must be the forerunners of a larger British force, de Galles attempted to pass his fleet through the Raz de Sein. This channel was a narrow, rocky and dangerous passage, and de Galles used corvettes as temporary light ships that shone blue lights and fired fireworks to direct his main fleet through the passage. Pellew observed this, and sailed Indefatigable right through the French fleet, launching rockets and shining lights seemingly at random. This succeeded in confusing the French officers, causing the S√©duisant to strike the Grand Stevenent rock and sink with the loss of over 680 men from a complement of 1,300.James, p. 6. S√©duisant's distress flares added to the confusion and delayed the fleet's passage until dawn. His task of observing the enemy completed, Pellew took his remaining squadron to Falmouth, sent a report to the Admiralty by semaphore telegraph, and refitted his ships. Failure of the Exp√©dition d'Irlande Jean- Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse During December 1796 and early January 1797, the French army repeatedly attempted to land in Ireland. Early in the voyage, the frigate Fraternit√© carrying de Galles and Hoche, was separated from the fleet and missed the rendezvous at Mizen Head. Admiral Bouvet and General Grouchy decided to attempt the landing at Bantry Bay without their commanders, but severe weather made any landing impossible.Henderson, p. 22. For more than a week the fleet waited for a break in the storm, until Bouvet abandoned the invasion on 29 December and, after a brief and unsuccessful effort to land at the mouth of the River Shannon, ordered his scattered ships to return to Brest.Regan, p. 89. During the operation and subsequent retreat a further 11 ships were wrecked or captured, with the loss of thousands of soldiers and sailors.James, p. 10. By 13 January most of the survivors of the fleet had limped back to France in a state of disrepair. One ship of the line that remained at sea, the 74-gun Droits de l'Homme, was commanded by Commodore Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse and carried over 1,300 men, 700‚Äì800 of them soldiers, including General Jean Humbert.Parkinson, p. 177. Detached from the main body of the fleet during the retreat from Bantry Bay, Lacrosse made his way to the mouth of the Shannon alone. Recognising that the weather was still too violent for a landing to be made, Lacrosse acknowledged the failure of the operation and ordered the ship to return to France, capturing the British privateer Cumberland en route.Woodman, p. 86. Chase Pellew too was on his way back to Brest in Indefatigable, accompanied by Amazon under the command of Captain Robert Carthew Reynolds. While the rest of the Channel Fleet had been pursuing the French without success, Pellew had had his ships refitted and resupplied at Falmouth so that both frigates were at full complement, well armed and prepared for action. At 13:00 on 13 January, the British ships were approaching the island of Ushant in a heavy fog when they spied another ship through the gloom ahead.James, p. 11. This ship, clearly much larger than either of the British vessels, was the Droits de l'Homme. At the same time, lookouts on the French ship spotted the British, and Lacrosse was faced with the dilemma of whether or not to engage the enemy. He knew that his ship was far larger than either of his opponents, but had earlier spotted sails to westwards he believed to be British and thus considered himself outnumbered and possibly surrounded. British records show that no other British vessels were in the vicinity at the time and it is likely that Lacrosse had seen the French ships R√©volution and Fraternit√© returning to Brest from Bantry Bay. In addition, Lacrosse was concerned by the increasing gale and rocky lee shoreline, which posed a considerable threat to his over-laden vessel, which was already damaged from its winter voyage and carried a demi-brigade of the French Army and Humbert, neither of which could be placed at risk in an inconsequential naval action.Henderson, p. 23. Determined to avoid battle, Lacrosse turned southeast, hoping to use his wider spread of sail to outrun his opponent in the strong winds. Pellew, however, manoeuvred to cut the Droits de l'Homme off from the French coast, at this stage still unsure of the nature of his opponent. As the chase developed, the weather, which had been violent for the entire preceding month, worsened. An Atlantic gale swept the Ushant headland, driving a blizzard eastwards and whipping the sea into a turbulent state, making steering and aiming more difficult. At 16:15, two of Droits de l'Homme's topmasts broke in the strong winds. This dramatically slowed the French ship, and allowed Pellew, who had recognised his opponent as a French ship of the line, to close with Droits de l'Homme.Woodman, p. 87. Battle Pellew was aware that his frigate was heavily outclassed by his much larger opponent, and that Amazon, which was distant, was not large enough to redress the balance when it did arrive. He correctly assumed, however, that the ocean was too rough to allow Lacrosse to open his lower gunports without the risk that heavy waves would enter them and cause Droits de l'Homme to founder.Gardiner, p. 159. In fact, the French ship was totally unable to open her lower deck gunports during the action: an unusual design feature had the ports lower than was normal and as a result the sea poured in at any attempt to open them, preventing any gunnery at all from the lower deck and halving the ship's firepower.James, p. 12. Although this reduced the number of available guns on the French vessel, Lacrosse still held the advantage in terms of size, weight of shot and manpower. The French situation was worsened however by the loss of the topmasts: this caused their ship to roll so severely in the high seas that it was far more difficult both to steer the ship and to aim the guns than on the British vessels. View of the wreck of the French ship Le Droits de l'Homme, by John Fairburn. To the surprise of Lacrosse and his officers, Indefatigable did not retreat from the ship of the line, nor did she pass the ship of the line at long-range to leeward as expected. Instead, at 17:30, Pellew closed with the stern of Droits de l'Homme and opened a raking fire. Lacrosse turned to meet the threat and opened fire with the guns on the upper deck accompanied by a heavy volley of musket fire from the soldiers on board. Pellew then attempted to pull ahead of Droits de l'Homme and rake her bow, to which Lacrosse responded by attempting to ram Indefatigable. Neither manoeuvre was successful, as Droits de l'Homme raked the British ship but caused little damage as most of her shot scattered into the ocean. Indefatigable and Droits de l'Homme manoeuvred around one another, exchanging fire when possible until 18:45, when Amazon arrived. During this exchange, one of Droits de l'Hommes cannon burst, causing heavy casualties on her packed deck.Woodman, p. 88. Approaching the larger French ship with all sail spread, Reynolds closed to within pistol shot before raking Droits de l'Homme. Lacrosse responded to this new threat by manoeuvring to bring both British ships to face the westward side of his ship, avoiding becoming trapped in a crossfire.Henderson, p. 24. The battle continued until 19:30, when both Amazon and Indefatigable pulled away from their opponent to make hasty repairs.Clowes, p. 303. By 20:30, the frigates had returned to the much slower French ship and began weaving in front of Droits de l'Hommes bow, repeatedly raking her.Henderson, p. 25. Lacrosse's increasingly desperate attempts to ram the British ships were all unsuccessful and what little cannon fire he did manage to deploy was ineffectual, as the rolling of the ship of the line prevented reliable aiming. By 22:30, Droits de l'Homme was in severe difficulties, with heavy casualties among her crew and passengers and the loss of her mizzenmast to British fire. Observing the battered state of their opponent, Pellew and Reynolds closed on the stern quarters of the French ship, maintaining a high rate of fire that was sporadically returned by Droits de l'Homme.James, p. 13. Having exhausted the 4,000 cannonballs available, Lacrosse was forced to use the shells he was carrying, which had been intended for use by the army in Ireland. In the high winds, these proved even less effective than solid shot, but did drive the frigates to longer range. With their opponent almost immobilised, the British frigates were able to remain outside her arc of fire, effect repairs when necessary and secure guns that had broken loose in the heavy seas.Woodman, p. 89. For the rest of the night the three battered ships remained locked in a close range duel, until suddenly, at 04:20 while it was still dark, land was spotted just to leeward by Lieutenant George Bell of the Indefatigable. Shipwrecks Pellew immediately turned seawards in an effort to escape the shore and signalled Reynolds to follow suit. Although both ships had suffered severe damage from the battle and weather, they were able to make the turn away from land, Amazon to the north and Indefatigable, at the insistence of its Breton pilot, to the south. Initially it was believed that the land spotted was the island of Ushant, which would have given the ships plenty of sea-room in which to manoeuvre. However at 06:30, with the sky lightening, it became apparent on the Indefatigable that there were breakers to the south and east, indicating that the three ships had drifted during the night into Audierne Bay.James, p. 16. On discovering his situation, Pellew was determined to bring his ship westwards, attempting to work his ship out of danger by beating against the wind. Hasty repairs had to be made to the damaged rigging before it was safe to alter their course.Parkinson, p. 178. Due to her northwards turn, Amazon had even less room to manoeuvre than Indefatigable and by 05:00 she had struck a sandbank. Although the frigate remained upright, attempts over several hours to bring her off failed; at 08:00 Reynolds ordered his men to prepare to abandon ship. Droits de l'Homme had been more seriously damaged than the British frigates, and was closer to shore at the time land was spotted. As Lacrosse's crew made desperate efforts to turn southwards, the ship's foremast and bowsprit collapsed under the pressure of the wind. With the ship virtually unmanageable, Lacrosse ordered the anchors lowered in an attempt to hold the ship in position until repairs could be made. This effort was futile, as all but two anchors had been lost during efforts to hold position in Bantry Bay, and British gunfire had damaged one of the anchor cables and rendered it useless.James, p. 17. The final anchor was deployed, but it failed to restrain the ship and at 07:00 (according to the French account), the Droits de l'Homme struck a sandbank close to the town of Ploz√©vet. This broke off the remaining mast and caused the ship to heel over onto her side.James, p. 18. Amazon As daylight broke over Audierne Bay, crowds of locals gathered on the beach. The Droits de l'Homme lay on her side directly opposite the town of Ploz√©vet, with large waves breaking over her hull; to the north, Amazon stood upright on a sandbar, her crew launching boats in an effort to reach the shore, while Indefatigable was the only ship still afloat, rounding the Penmarck rocks at the southern edge of the bay at 11:00. On board the Amazon, Reynolds maintained discipline and gave orders to launch the ship's boats in an orderly fashion and to build rafts in which to bring the entire crew safely to shore. Six men disobeyed his command, stole a launch, and attempted to reach the shore alone, but were swept away by the current. Their boat was capsized by the waves, and all six drowned. The remaining crew, including those wounded in the previous night's action, were safely brought ashore by 09:00, where they were made prisoners of war by the French authorities.Henderson, p. 29. Droits de l'Homme Droits de l'Homme was irreparably damaged, and many of the men on board were soldiers with no training for what to do in the event of a shipwreck. Each successive wave swept more men into the water and desperate attempts to launch boats failed when the small craft were swept away by the waves and broken in the surf. Rafts were constructed, but several were swamped in attempts to carry a rope to the shore. The men on the one raft that remained upright were forced to cut the rope to prevent them from foundering in the heavy seas. Some of the men on this raft reached the beach, the first survivors of the wreck. Subsequent attempts were made by individuals to swim to shore with ropes, but they were either drowned or driven back to the ship by the force of the sea. With no aid possible from the shore, night fell on 14 January with most of the crew and passengers still aboard. During the night, the waves stove in (smashed in) the stern of the ship, flooding much of the interior. On the morning of 15 January, a small boat carrying nine British prisoners (part of the crew of the Cumberland, captured by Droits de l'Homme earlier in the campaign) managed to reach shore. The sight of the British- manned boat reaching shore prompted a mass launching of small rafts from the wreck in hopes of gaining the beach. However the waves increased once more, and not one of these small craft survived the passage.Pipon in Tracy, p. 169. By the morning of 16 January, the seas were still rough, whilst hunger and panic had taken over on the wreck. When a large raft carrying the wounded, two women and six children was launched during a lull in the weather, over 120 unwounded men scrambled to board it. This severely overloaded the craft and within minutes a large wave struck the heavy raft and capsized it, drowning all aboard.James, p. 19. By the evening, the remaining survivors, without food or fresh water, began to succumb to exposure, and at least one officer drowned in a desperate attempt to swim to shore. Throughout the night, the survivors gathered on the less exposed parts of the hull, and, in the hope of staving off death by dehydration, drank sea water, urine, or vinegar from a small barrel that had floated up from the hold.Pipon in Tracy, p. 170. The morning of 17 January finally saw a reduction in the storm and the arrival of a small French naval brig, the Arrogante. This ship could not come close without the risk of grounding but sent her boats to the wreck in the hope of rescuing survivors. The brig was joined later in the day by the cutter Aiguille.Clowes, p. 304. On the Droits de l'Homme, many survivors were too weak to reach the boats, and a number of men fell from the hull and drowned in the attempt. Many more could not find room in the small boats, and only 150 men were rescued on 17 January. The following morning, when the boats returned, they found only 140 survivors left, at least as many again having died during the night. The last two people to leave the ship were the commanders General Humbert and Commodore Lacrosse. Taken to Brest, the survivors were fed and clothed and given medical treatment. All the surviving prisoners from the Cumberland were released and returned to Britain, in recognition of their efforts to save lives from the shipwreck.James, p. 20. Aftermath Menhir commemorating the wreck of Droits de l'Homme (shown in the picture as damaged by storm with the topmost portion having broken off)Exact French casualties are difficult to calculate, but of the 1,300 aboard Droits de l'Homme, 103 are known to have died in the battle and just over 300 were saved from the wreck, indicating the deaths of approximately 900 men on the French ship between the morning of 14 January and the morning of 18 January.James, pp. 15‚Äì19. However, a French source suggests that up to another 500 of the crew were rescued from the wreck by the corvette Arrogante and the cutter Aiguille on 17 and 18 January.Jakez Cornou et Bruno Jonin, L'odyss√©e du vaisseau \\"Droits de l'homme\\" : L'exp√©dition d'Irlande de 1796, √©ditions Dufa, 1 January 1988, p. 216. This would give a toll of only about 400. A menhir at Ploz√©vet, with an inscription carved in 1840 gives a death toll of six hundred. Amazon lost three in the battle and six in her wreck, with 15 wounded, while Indefatigable did not lose a single man killed, suffering only 18 wounded.James, p. 15. The discrepancy in losses during the action is likely due to the extreme difficulty the French crew had in aiming their guns given their ship's instability in heavy seas. Reynolds and his officers were exchanged for French prisoners some weeks later, and in the routine court-martial investigating the loss of their ship were honourably acquitted \\"with every sentiment of the court's highest approbation.\\" Reynolds was subsequently appointed to the large frigate . The senior lieutenants of each frigate were promoted to commander and head money (prize money based on the number of the enemy's crew and awarded when the defeated ship was destroyed) was distributed among the crews. Pellew remained in command of Indefatigable off Brest for another year and seized a number of French merchant ships. He was later promoted several times, and by the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had become Lord Exmouth, Commander in Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet. Reynolds did not survive the war, dying in the wreck of in 1811. Lacrosse and Humbert were not censured for the loss of their ship: the commodore was promoted to admiral and later became ambassador to Spain, while Humbert led the next and equally unsuccessful attempt to invade Ireland, surrendering at the Battle of Ballinamuck in 1798.Pakenham, p. 289. In Britain, the action was lauded at the time and since: First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Spencer described the operation as \\"an exploit which has not I believe ever before graced our naval annals\\". Historian James Henderson says of the action: \\"It was a feat of arms and seamanship such as had never been done before, and never was done again,\\" and Richard Woodman calls it \\"a dazzling display of seamanship by all concerned in the alternating darkness and moonlight of a boisterous night\\". Five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by the Naval General Service Medal, with clasps \\"Indefatigable 13 Jany. 1797\\" and \\"Amazon 13 Jany. 1797\\", awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.

Biography Film Production His debut as a film producer was David and Lisa, which received two Oscar nominations and innumerable awards. He was the executive producer of 1990's Oscar winner, My Left Foot, which earned five Academy Award nominations and Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress. Heller's commitment to high quality films has been the hallmark of his career. His film, The Eavesdropper won acclaim as Best Film at Mar del Plata and honors at both the New York and London Film Festivals. It was also nominated for Best Foreign Film at the French Awards, as was his film Secret Ceremony, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Mia Farrow. Although Heller worked as a successful Warner Bros. executive, overseeing such films as Skin Game, starring James Garner, and Dirty Harry, starring Clint Eastwood, he prefers the life of the independent producer. In that role he is able to combine the goal of making quality films with his love of hands-on involvement in the process of film-making. A process that has so far created and developed over 30 feature films and numerous projects in allied fields. In 1973, Heller founded Sequoia Pictures, Inc., a production house affiliated with Warner Bros.. The company's first production was Enter the Dragon, the film that set off the explosion of interest in the martial arts genre and which introduced Bruce Lee to the international film market place. Eleven more films followed with an unprecedented financial success rate. His production company, Paul Heller Productions produced First Monday in October, starring Walter Matthau and Jill Clayburgh, and more recently the critically acclaimed British film, Withnail & I, written and directed by Bruce Robinson. He was the ground breaker in the cable TV feature market, producing the first made-for-cable feature film, Falcon's Gold, and then, Showtime's, Pygmalion, starring Peter O'Toole and Margot Kidder. Heller now only makes pictures that delight him from the first reading of the script. Following The Annihilation of Fish, is another film with writer-director Bruce Robinson, entitled The Block. Television Production Heller first has produced a television movie Wait Until Dark, which is distributed by Warner Bros. and HBO in 1982. In the same year, he has produced CBS Television and Showtime's Falcon's Gold. In 1998, he was involved in ABC's David and Lisa, produced with Oprah's Harpo Productions. During this time, Heller renewed his interest in teaching promising young students of film. Heller was approached by the American Film Institute to develop a producing program for their new school in Los Angeles, the American Film Institute Center for Advanced Studies. He had previously taught Film and Television Design at both New York University and Columbia University, and founded the Community Film Workshop Council with the American Film Institute. This was followed, over the years, by lectures at conferences and by teaching two Master Programs in Producing at The University of California, Los Angeles. He currently heads the Education and Outreach Committee of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, Los Angeles. Philanthropic Activities In 1989, Heller founded ASK Theatre, a nonprofit group dedicated to new plays and playwrights, which works together with the Mark Taper Theatre in Los Angeles, The Royal Court Theatre in London and Lincoln Center in New York. He is also a member of the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and serves on the board of directors of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts as well as on the board of the Hearst Castle Preservation Foundation. He is a member of the United Scenic Artists, the Directors Guild and the Screen Actors Guild. In October 2010, Heller made an opening remark for the Koyamada Foundation's United States Martial Arts Festival at the Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center in Redondo Beach, California. Heller serves as the Board of Directors of the Koyamada Foundation. Multimedia and theatrical Heller has been a pioneer in the field of multimedia and theatrical presentations. His productions include The New York Experience, which played for sixteen highly successful years at Rockefeller Center, and The South Street Venture, a popular attraction for seven years at the Dockland of New York City. He has recently completed the extensive audiovisual and multimedia exhibits for the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles and expects to begin work on the Hong Kong Museum of History in the near future.

By the time it became an official federal holiday in 1894, thirty states in the United States officially celebrated Labor Day. Canada's Labour Day is also celebrated on the first Monday of September. More than 80 countries celebrate International Workers' Day on May 1, the ancient European holiday of May Day. May Day was chosen by the Second International of socialist and communist parties to commemorate the Haymarket affair which occurred in Chicago on May 4, 1886.Philip S. Foner (1986).

History  Origin Beginning in the late 19th century, as the trade union and labor movements grew, different groups of trade unionists chose a variety of days on which to celebrate labor. In the United States, a September holiday called Labor Day was first proposed in the early 1880s. Alternate stories of the event's origination exist. According to one early history of Labor Day, the event originated in connection with a General Assembly of the Knights of Labor convened in New York City in September 1882.\\"Origin of Labor Day\\", Cincinnati Tribune, September 1, 1895, Special Labor Day supplement, p. 26. In connection with this clandestine Knights assembly, a public parade of various labor organizations was held on September 5 under the auspices of the Central Labor Union (CLU) of New York. Secretary of the CLU Matthew Maguire is credited for first proposing that a national Labor Day holiday subsequently be held on the first Monday of each September in the aftermath of this successful public demonstration.\\"McGuire or Maguire? A Tussle Over Who Founded Labor Day,\\" by Jenny Gross, The New York Times, September 6, 2020 Descendants of two men with similar last names claim their great-grandfather was the true father of the holiday. P. J. McGuire, Vice President of the American Federation of Labor, is frequently credited as the father of Labor Day in the United States. An alternative thesis maintains that the idea of Labor Day was the brainchild of Peter J. McGuire, a vice president of the American Federation of Labor, who, after a visit to Toronto where he saw parades celebrating labor that May, had put forward the initial proposal in the spring of 1882. According to McGuire, on May 8, 1882, he made a proposition to the fledgling Central Labor Union in New York City that a day be set aside for a \\"general holiday for the laboring classes\\".P.J. McGuire, \\"Labor Day ‚Äì Its Birth and Significance\\", The Union Agent [Kentucky], vol. 3, no. 9 (Sept. 1898), p. 1. According to McGuire he further recommended that the event should begin with a street parade as a public demonstration of organized labor's solidarity and strength, with the march followed by a picnic, to which participating local unions could sell tickets as a fundraiser. According to McGuire he suggested the first Monday in September as an ideal date for such a public celebration, owing to optimum weather and the date's place on the calendar, sitting midway between the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving public holidays. Labor Day picnics and other public gatherings frequently featured speeches by prominent labor leaders. In 1909, the American Federation of Labor convention designated the Sunday preceding Labor Day as \\"Labor Sunday\\", to be dedicated to the spiritual and educational aspects of the labor movement. This secondary date failed to gain significant traction in popular culture, although some churches continue to acknowledge it. Legal recognition The popularity of the event spread across the country. In 1887, Oregon became the first state of the United States to make Labor Day an official public holiday. By 1894, thirty U.S. states were already officially celebrating Labor Day. In that year, Congress passed a bill recognizing the first Monday of September as Labor Day and making it an official federal holiday. President Grover Cleveland signed the bill into law on June 28. The federal law, however, only made it a holiday for federal workers. As late as the 1930s, unions were encouraging workers to strike to make sure they got the day off. All U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the United States territories have subsequently made Labor Day a statutory holiday. Labor Day vs. May Day California Governor Gavin Newsom on International Workers Day - a.k.a. Labor Day or May Day - with a worker at American River College in 2019. The date of May 1 (an ancient European folk holiday known as May Day) emerged in 1886 as an alternative holiday for the celebration of labor, later becoming known as International Workers' Day. The date had its origins at the 1885 convention of the American Federation of Labor, which passed a resolution calling for adoption of the eight-hour day effective May 1, 1886.Philip S. Foner, May Day: A Short History of the International Workers' Holiday. New York: International Publishers, 1986; p. 19. While negotiation was envisioned for achievement of the shortened work day, use of the strike to enforce this demand was recognized, with May 1 advocated as a date for coordinated strike action. The proximity of the date to the bloody Haymarket affair of May 4, 1886, further accentuated May First's radical reputation. There was disagreement among labor unions at this time about when a holiday celebrating workers should be, with some advocating for continued emphasis of the September march-and-picnic date while others sought the designation of the more politically charged date of May 1. Conservative Democratic President Grover Cleveland was one of those concerned that a labor holiday on May 1 would tend to become a commemoration of the Haymarket affair and would strengthen socialist and anarchist movements that backed the May 1 commemoration around the globe. Sally Kohn (September 1, 2014). Why Labor Day was a political move. CNN. Retrieved August 3, 2018. In 1887, he publicly supported the September Labor Day holiday as a less inflammatory alternative, formally adopting the date as a United States federal holiday through a law that he signed in 1894. Since the mid-1950s, the United States has celebrated Loyalty Day and Law Day on May 1. Unlike Labor Day, both are not legal public holidays (in that non-essential government agencies and most businesses do not shut down to celebrate them) and therefore have remained relatively obscure. Loyalty Day is formally celebrated in a few cities, while some bar associations hold Law Day events to celebrate the rule of law.  Unofficial end of summer  Labor Day is called the \\"unofficial end of summer\\" because it marks the end of the cultural summer season. Many take their two-week vacations during the two weeks ending Labor Day weekend. Many fall activities, such as school and sports, begin about this time. In the United States, many school districts resume classes around the Labor Day holiday weekend (see First day of school). Some begin the week before, making Labor Day weekend the first three-day weekend of the school calendar, while others return the Tuesday following Labor Day. Many districts across the Midwest are opting to begin school after Labor Day. In the U.S. state of Virginia, the amusement park industry has successfully lobbied for legislation requiring most school districts in the state to have their first day of school after Labor Day, in order to give families another weekend to visit amusement parks in the state. The relevant statute has been nicknamed the \\"Kings Dominion law\\" after one such park. This law was repealed in 2019. In the U.S. state of Minnesota, the State Fair ends on Labor Day. Under state law, public schools normally do not begin until after the holiday. One reason given for this timing was to allow time for schoolchildren to show 4-H projects at the Fair. In U.S. sports, Labor Day weekend marks the beginning of many fall sports. National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) teams usually play their first games that weekend, and the National Football League (NFL) traditionally play their kickoff game the Thursday following Labor Day. The Southern 500 NASCAR auto race has been held on Labor Day weekend at Darlington Raceway in Darlington, South Carolina from 1950 to 2003 and since 2015. At Indianapolis Raceway Park, the National Hot Rod Association hold their finals of the NHRA U.S. Nationals drag race that weekend. Labor Day is the middle point between weeks one and two of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships held in Flushing Meadows, New York. In fashion, Labor Day is (or was) considered the last day when it is acceptable to wear white or seersucker. There are numerous events and activities organized in major cities. For example, New York offers the Labor Day Carnival, and fireworks over Coney Island. In Washington, one popular event is the Labor Day Concert at the U.S. Capitol featuring the National Symphony Orchestra with free attendance.  Labor Day sales  To take advantage of large numbers of potential customers with time to shop, Labor Day has become an important weekend for discounts and allowances by many retailers in the United States, especially for back-to-school sales. Some retailers claim it is one of the largest sale dates of the year, second only to the Christmas season's Black Friday.
