Biography Isbell was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of an army officer from Isbell, a town in Franklin County, Alabama.Harloe (1943)... He attended several undergraduate institutions, including the University of Chicago, where professor Saunders Mac Lane was a source of inspiration. He began his graduate studies in mathematics at Chicago, briefly studied at Oklahoma A&M; University and the University of Kansas,The University of Kansas had professors Ainsley Diamond and Nachman Aronszajn, who had previously been professors at Oklahoma A&M.; The two moved to Kansas after Oklahoma A&M; had instituted a requirement that instructors sign a strict loyalty oath. Ainsley Diamond, as a quaker, had refused to sign the loyalty oath. and eventually completed a Ph.D. in game theory at Princeton University in 1954 under the supervision of Albert W. Tucker.. After graduation, Isbell was drafted into the U.S. Army, and stationed at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. In the late 1950s he worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, from which he then moved to the University of Washington and Case Western Reserve University. He joined the University at Buffalo in 1969, and remained there until his retirement in 2002.Announcement of Isbell's death in Topology News, October 2005. Research Isbell published over 140 papers under his own name, and several others under pseudonyms. Isbell published the first paper by John Rainwater, a fictitious mathematician who had been invented by graduate students at the University of Washington in 1952. After Isbell's paper, other mathematicians have published papers using the name \\"Rainwater\\" and have acknowledged \\"Rainwater's assistance\\" in articles.The seminar on functional analysis at the University of Washington has been called the \\"Rainwater seminar\\". Isbell published other articles using two additional pseudonyms, M. G. Stanley and H. C. Enos, publishing two under each. Many of his works involved topology and category theory: *He was \\"the leading contributor to the theory of uniform spaces\\". *Isbell duality is a form of duality arising when a mathematical object can be interpreted as a member of two different categories; a standard example is the Stone duality between sober spaces and complete Heyting algebras with sufficiently many points.. *Isbell was the first to study the category of metric spaces defined by metric spaces and the metric maps between them, and did early work on injective metric spaces and the tight span construction.. In abstract algebra, Isbell found a rigorous formulation for the Pierce‚ÄìBirkhoff conjecture on piecewise-polynomial functions.. He also made important contributions to the theory of median algebras.. In geometric graph theory, Isbell was the first to prove the bound œá ‚â§ 7 on the Hadwiger‚ÄìNelson problem, the question of how many colors are needed to color the points of the plane in such a way that no two points at unit distance from each other have the same color..

The other three are LeClaire Park, which is immediately to the east of Centennial Park, Veterans Memorial Park, which is being developed immediately to the west, and River Heritage Park that is under development on the far east side of downtown. Development of the park was begun in 2000. Its name is derived from the Rock Island Centennial Bridge, which is on the east side of the park. Centennial Park features a boat ramp, a playground, a gazebo, fishing areas, a dog off leash area, basketball courts, a sprayground, and a skateboard park. The skate board park is used for skateboarding, roller blades and BMX bikes. The Riverfront Parkway passes through the park, and the River‚Äôs Edge, an indoor sports complex operated by Davenport Parks and Recreation, is on the northeast corner of the park. History The site where Centennial Park now sits is a former landfill used by the city of Davenport until 1975. The north part of the property was the location of a rail yard and the southern portion was used as a festival ground in the late 20th century, with a few commercial buildings on the west side of the property. The park's construction was a part of a $100 million project called River Vision that was passed by the city council in 2004. The skate board park was the first element of the park that opened in 2006. It was designed by SITE Design Group Inc., of Tempe, Arizona. The basketball courts, concession stand and stage were opened in 2009. The last three commercial buildings on the site were torn down the same year to make way for the spraypark that was constructed in 2010. In late 2010 and early 2011 part of what was the festival grounds was paved for parking and the rest is being seeded for an open green space.

Located in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The station will be built as part of the state's effort to extend rail service to Fall River and New Bedford. New Bedford station will be built on the former New Bedford and Taunton Railroad. The station is anticipated to open in 2023 along with the rest of South Coast Rail Phase 1. History =South Coast Rail= In September 2008, MassDOT released 18 potential station sites for the South Coast Rail project, including three in downtown New Bedford: Whale's Tooth (the name of a ferry parking lot) at the former station location, and State Pier at State Pier Maritime Terminal (the former steamship wharf). The Whale's Tooth site was selected; a 2010 conceptual design called for a single side platform serving a single track, with a station building and bus plaza at the north end of the parking lot. The existing footbridge over Route 18 at Pearl Street would be rebuilt. On June 11, 2010, the state took ownership of the New Bedford Subdivision and several other CSX lines as part of a sale agreement. Plans released as part of the Final Environmental Impact Report in 2013 placed the Wamsutta layover yard just north of the station, with a second track serving as yard access and a freight passing track. The station building and bus plaza were removed from the design; the existing footbridge would be reused. In 2017, the project was re-evaluated due to cost issues. A new proposal released in March 2017 called for early service via Middleborough by 2024, followed by full service via Stoughton by 2029. In 2019, the planned station name was changed from Whale's Tooth to New Bedford for clarity. By then, a new footbridge at Willis Street (a block south of the existing bridge) was added to the design. The MBTA awarded a $403.5 million contract for the Middleborough Secondary and New Bedford Secondary portions of the project, including New Bedford station, on August 24, 2020; construction was expected to begin later in 2020 and take 37 months.

Life and career Nakano was born in Osaka, Japan in 1962. He began working in pink film with the Shint≈çh≈ç Eiga company and in 1991, together with Toshiki Sat≈ç and Toshiya Ueno, Nakano assembled a conpendium of the best scenes from pink films which was released by Shint≈çh≈ç Eiga as That's Hentai-tainment. Nakano made his debut as a director with the pink film , also known as Spiral Zone, for Shint≈çh≈ç Eiga in 1992.Sharp, p.352 Nakano won the Best New Director award at the 1992 Pink Grand Prix ceremony. Nakano moved into the adult video (AV) scene in 1993 directing two videos for V&R; Planning, and . The next year, Nakano produced the tentacle rape genre video, ExorSister, the first of a series of four hardcore erotic horror releases. The videos all featured manga artist Bang Ippongi as Maria Cruel the ExorSister. The Allmovie site commented on the \\"cheesy\\" quality of the shot on video productions. One of the sequels Uratsukid≈çji: Daiinshin Fukkatsu-hen starred AV Idol Yumika Hayashi. Nakano followed this series with the 1996 softcore comedy video featuring topless sumo wrestling girls including actress Kei Mizutani. It was later (2001) released with English subtitles. As an actor, Nakano performed in the gay-themed 1997 pink film .Sharp p.346 In 1998 Nakano wrote and directed the V-Cinema release set in the Edo period and starring actresses Yumi Yoshiyuki, Yumika Hayashi and Hotaru Hazuki. He was also the screenwriter for the 2000 pink film fantasy Whore Angels which won the Silver Prize for Best Film of the year at the 2000 Pink Grand Prix ceremony. Nakano's second venture into directing pink film was again for Shint≈çh≈ç Eiga, the May 2002 production .Sharp p.352 But Nakano's most important contribution to pink film was probably his screenplay for the internationally known The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai which had a significant effect on the making of pink film.Sharp p.328 Nakano also continued his career as a pink film actor, appearing in several works directed by Yumi Yoshiyuki, including the February 2004 Aspiring Home Tutor: Soiled Pure Whiteness which took the award for Seventh Best Film at the Pink Grand Prix ceremony and the Pearl Prize at the Pinky Ribbon Awards and the 2005 Miss Peach: Peachy Sweetness Huge Breasts which won the fifth Best Film of the year at the Pink Grand Prix ceremony and the Pinky Ribbon Award as the Best Film of 2005. In August 2004, he returned to the horror genre, writing and directing the low-budget V-Cinema , a revision of David Cronenberg's Shivers starring Yumi Yoshiyuki and Sakurako Kaoru. One review describes it as a \\"comical, over-the-top\\" film \\"that delivers a bizarre storyline that is largely entertaining.\\" The film was a subject of one of the segments of the BBC documentary Japanorama. Nakano has been active in promoting live girl-on-girl wrestling bouts in Tokyo and several of his works have featured wrestling or cat fighting including the previously mentioned Sumo Vixens and the 2002 video which also starred Kei Mizutani. He also wrote the screenplay for the wrestling comedy Kabuto-O Beetle from 2005. More recently, he wrote and directed the 2009 erotic comedy , a fantasy comedy based on a manga by Okada Kazuto about a bullied school custodian who becomes a human frog with superhuman powers when he is bitten by a poisonous frog. He also wrote and directed the May 2010 release Big Tits Zombie featuring AV Idol Sora Aoi as a zombie killing stripper. Nakano was one of several former colleagues who participated in the 2009 documentary by Japanese-Korean director Tetsuaki Matsue on Yumika Hayashi titled .

James Edward Kelsey (born November 15, 1964) is an American Abstract Expressionist sculptor best known for creating large stainless steel abstract curvilinear sculptures. Biography James Edward Kelsey was born on November 15, 1964 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and moved to Renton, Washington in 1965, where he spent his childhood until age 13. In 1977 his father was hired by Bell Helicopter and moved his family to Tehran, Iran. James was first exposed to the concept of abstract art while living in the Middle East and experiencing the abstract nature of Islamic art. His family left Iran in 1979 due to the onset of the Iranian revolution. Kelsey discovered his love of creating art in junior high school and experimented with photography, wood shop, ceramics, and a short course in metal casting. When he was in high school, his father died, and he dropped out of school halfway through 10th grade. He immediately attained his G.E.D. and married at age 17, a marriage which lasted six years. At age 18, he became a firefighter in the United States Air Force and was stationed in Aviano, Italy. While living there, he explored much of the art and architecture of Northern Italy, Venice, and Pisa. This is also the first time he met men and women working as full-time artists both as painters and sculptors. In 1987, he was honorably discharged from the Air Force. Instead of producing art, he enrolled at Big Bend Community College in Moses Lake, Washington to pursue his love of flying. He was awarded a commercial pilot license and continued on to Eastern Washington University, from which he graduated with honors and a degree in Business and Interpersonal Communication. After College, Kelsey moved back to Seattle, Washington with his partner and soon-to-be wife, Misty Devin, whom he had met in college. In 1996 they moved to Everett, Washington Devins' job. While there, Kelsey wrote his yet-unpublished novel, The Last Icon. In 1998 they moved again, to Bremerton, Washington. Kelsey decided to finally ignore much of the advice he had heard throughout his life and pursue his love of art with the goal of making it a career. He enrolled in the welding program at Olympic College. By the end of the two-year program, he had created four significant sculptures including And He Offered the Moon To the Sky, his first piece of public art, which can currently be seen on the Olympic College campus. While still taking classes, he secured a job with a local metal fabrication company as their sole welder and honed his skills while continuing his classes. Two years later, he quit his welding job to work for three years for a local stone sculptor, Will Robinson. Kelsey served as the fabricator for Robinson's bases and fountain basins, as well as learning stoneworking skills. This was also Kelsey's introduction to the business side of the art world as he accompanied Robinson to his galleries and installed sculptures in clients' homes. In 2002, Kelsey built his own studio on his property in Port Orchard, Washington. In 2007 Kelsey divorced from Misty Devin, his wife of 15 years. During that same year the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 began. He struggled to maintain his home and art studio, but as the recession continued in 2012 he was forced to sell before an imminent foreclosure as part of the 2010 United States foreclosure crisis. In November 2012 Kelsey signed a contract with the mint company I.P. Callisons and traded three of his sculptures, Helios, Industrial Heart, and Eye of the Beholder, II, for one of their 7,000 square foot facilities in Centralia, Washington. In 2013 Kelsey was commissioned by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington to create Touching the Intangible and Tuareg Sun. A Model: Maquette for Public Sculpture #4, stainless steel (2010) Major works Memories in Blue (executed in 2005‚Äì2006) is the primary sculpture in a memorial installation for the Tacoma Police Department. Also in this installation is For All They Gave, a bronze and granite piece with the names, dates, and stories of each officer who died in the line of duty. Connecting these to sculptures is a 100-foot glass line titled Thin Blue Line. Tsunami in Steel (2009) is Kelsey‚Äôs first international sculpture. It is a private / public collaboration between Am-Pri Homebuilders and the City of Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. Inspired by the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, Kelsey was unable to let the thoughts and images out of his mind. His mother lives along the Pacific Ocean and in creating this sculpture he was able to settle his mind and move on. Touching the Intangible (2013) is part of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center's art collection. The sculpture represents the efforts of doctors and scientists who search for the causes and cures of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. From the artist: \\"Everyone at The Hutch is on a never-ending search for cures for diseases. The irony is that once they discover a potential cure, they simply pass it on to others to carry on the work and begin their search all over again with yet another disease. They are on the cutting edge of discovery.\\" The sculpture stands in front of the FHCRC's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Building in Seattle.

Los Angeles Times, p. R34. She performed professionally, often at the Magic Castle, earned over half her living through magic, and had the distinction of being one of the few female performing magicians. Teaching literacy Minnette Lenier used stage magic in the classroom to elevate student interest in the subject matter and worked mostly with remedial reading students. Lenier's stage magic, a concrete task, showed students that everyone has perceptual difficulties at times and that misperception can even bring enjoyment. Lenier gave optical illusions to everyone in class to examine, and would then discuss how people are fooled in general, and how the problems students have in reading could be solved. Lenier proved to students that to be fooled is not to be stupid. She allowed students to bring the illusions home so they could try them on other people to demonstrate that everyone is occasionally deceived by their eyes. Lenier noted that this also gives students the opportunity to be successful with others because they have the correct answers to the illusions. Lenier used magic not only with remedial students, but with gifted students as well. These students are often bored in their classes and Lenier discovered that learning magic is a mind-expanding activity for them. Minnette Lenier died suddenly of cardiac arrest in her home in Woodland Hills, California on February 7, 2011.

The temple is a short distance south of ≈åsu Kannon Station. It is also known a Nishi Betsuin (Ë•øÂà•Èô¢; \\"Western branch temple\\"), being associated with Nishi Hongan-ji (Ë•øÊú¨È°òÂØ∫). It is contrasted with the ≈åtani-ha temple of the same name, popularly known as Higashi Betsuin (Êù±Âà•Èô¢; \\"Eastern branch temple\\").  History  Illustration with an aerial view of the temple in the 19th century, from the Owari Meish≈ç Zue Hokusai painting the Great Daruma in 1817 View into the main hall Wooden sh≈çr≈ç (belltower) from the Edo period Hongan-ji Nagoya Betsuin dates back to about 1500 CE when chief abbot Rennyo's 13th child, Renjun, built Gansh≈ç-ji (È°òË®ºÂØ∫) in the Japanese cedar groves of Ise province. The temple later fell on hard times and was renovated. In the early Edo period it was moved to the current location at the time of the construction of Nagoya Castle. It was patronized by Baish≈ç-in, concubine of Tokugawa Tsunanari (1652‚Äì1699), lord of the Owari Domain. On 5 October 1817, Hokusai visited the temple and with the assistance of his disciples, painted the \\"Big Daruma\\" on paper, measuring 18x10.8 metres, impressing many onlookers. For this feat, he received the name \\"Darusen\\" (a shortened form of Daruma Sensei). Although the original was destroyed in 1945, promotional handbills from that time survived and are preserved at the Nagoya City Museum. According to several studies, a reproduction of the large painting was done at a large public event on 23 November 2017 to commemorate the 200-year anniversary of the painting, using the same size, techniques and material as the original. A prayer ceremony was done afterwards to bless the painting. In 1874, close to the temple, a medical training centre, the predecessor of Nagoya University's School of Medicine, was set up for medical research, practice and education. Later the centre was moved to Tennozaki on the banks of the Hori River. The wooden building and artwork were largely destroyed during the bombing of Nagoya in World War II in May 1945. It was rebuilt in a Mauryan Dynasty ancient Indian style. The wooden bell tower (sh≈çr≈ç) survived the war undamaged, and is said to be also donated by Baish≈ç-in in Ky≈çh≈ç 14 (1729). The bell is suspended on the lower level, different from the typical bell tower style. The carved sculptures are also of high quality. It was named a City-designated Cultural Property in 2017. Features On the grounds there is a bronze statue commemorating the founder Shinran. The Hongan-ji Betsuin houses the ashes of deceased persons, which are kept in their urns in metal lockers on the ground floor. By request from relatives, monks will perform prayer services for a fee.

Career  Lundgren was born in a musical family to Julie Clouse and Scott Lundgren in Port Townsend, Washington, where he also grew up. He started playing acoustic guitar, but later switched to jazz guitar, taking both lessons and working through guitar books. Since all his friends played guitar, he always was in three or four bands, including the Port Townsend High School Jazz Band and the rock band The Nihilists, which he co-founded and played with for six years. He names Django Reinhardt as a major influence in the jazz genre, and as a fan of Chris DeGarmo, he was learning Queensr√øche songs in high school. After graduation, Lundgren moved to Seattle to build a career in music, where he played in the punk group Sledgeback. In the summer of 2008, Lundgren also joined the touring band of Geoff Tate's solo project, while dating Tate's stepdaughter Miranda Tate. During that time, he had already become friends with the members of Tate's band Queensr√øche. Parker Lundgren with American punk rock band Sledgeback (2009) =Queensr√øche= A falling out between Queensr√øche and their then-guitarist Mike Stone opened up the position of guitarist in Queensr√øche. Lundgren became Stone's replacement, aided by the fact that he already knew most of their material. Lundgren was tipped that the upcoming tour would consist of the albums American Soldier, Rage for Order and Empire, which he learned before auditioning with Queensr√øche's lead guitarist, Michael Wilton. Wilton was surprised that Lundgren knew the whole set, and possibly also relieved he would not have to teach the new guitarist all the parts. Because of his new appointment with Queensr√øche, Lundgren left Sledgeback in February 2009. On July 18, he married Miranda Tate, but they divorced about six months later. In concert, Lundgren plays the original guitar solos by Wilton and original lead guitarist Chris DeGarmo note for note. It was suggested he do so by Wilton, because Kelly Gray and Stone (his predecessors replacing DeGarmo) had their own solos, to the fans' displeasure. Internal struggles between Tate and the other band members led to the lead vocalist being expelled from the band in June 2012. Lundgren was aware of creative differences, but did not know the full extent of the problems, explaining: \\"I just wanted to be there and do a good job. Whatever they had going on, it was all behind closed doors. (...) I just kinda tried to stay out of it.\\" He became aware of the details after the court documents became public. Queensr√øche continued with a new vocalist, Todd La Torre, while Lundgren (not one of the founding members) was free to choose whether or not he wanted to stay in the band. Guitarist Wilton praised Lundgren for making \\"a good decision\\" to stay. In 2013, Lundgren was actively involved in the writing process for the album Queensr√øche, writing the song \\"Where Dreams Go to Die\\" and contributing a guitar solo for \\"Don't Look Back\\". According to Wilton, the band members told him: \\"you're in a different situation now. In the last situation you weren't allowed to write, you were just a hired guy, you were just a player who had no say in any matter. This is completely different, you are part of the band, you are a writer, you can sing, you can do anything ‚Äì we want you to just go for it. Show us what you've got.\\" He is cited by the band for his drive to be \\"ever growing as a musician\\" and that \\"he has different influences than everybody else, which makes him a unique character in the creative process.\\" Lundgren also teaches guitar to students.

It is NP-hard to construct it, even for unweighted graphs. However, it has a polynomial-time approximation scheme.

Abdullah is said to be one of five openly gay Imams in the world (the others being Muhsin Hendricks of South Africa, Ludovic-Mohamed Zahed of France, El-Farouk Khaki of Toronto's el- Tawhid Juma Circle/The Unity Mosque, and Nur Warsame of Australia).http://vice.com/en_uk/read/life-as-a-gay-imam-isnt-as-bad-as-it- soundshttp://spiegel.de/international/world/a-985863.html#spRedirectedFrom=www&referrrer;= Abdullah was a member of and spiritual advisor of the Al-Fatiha Foundation until it closed in 2011. Abdullah is controversial, as he is openly gay and is a Muslim leader, although it is traditionally upheld that male homosexuality is forbidden in mainstream Islam.  Early life and education Abdullah was born in 1954 as Sidney Thompson in Detroit, Michigan. His parents supported him, his six older brothers, his younger sister, and his oldest step-sister from his father's first marriage to find religion despite his parent's Southern Baptist beliefs. When he was 8 years old, he visited a Synagogue, a Hindu temple, and an assortment of Christian denominations. None of these religions he had explored fit him exactly, so he continued to search for a religion he could put his faith into. He converted to Islam at age 30. When Abdullah was 15, he graduated from high school early because he had gone to summer school most summers. Along with summer school, he and his family traveled around North America so that he could see what the world was truly like. His parents believed that once a member of the family had graduated high school, he was an adult. Knowing this, Abdullah came out to his parents, and was accepted after assuring his parents that they had \\"done nothing wrong.\\" Abdullah has said that he knew he was attracted to other boys at the age of five. His parents, now both deceased, were a source of inspiration and confidence for him growing up. Abdullah graduated from the David A. Clarke School of Law in Washington, D.C. in 1995 as a juris doctor. He attended the Graduate School of Islamic Social Sciences in Ashburn, Virginia from 2000 to 2003, but was kicked out when the school discovered he was gay. Career In 1978, Abdullah went to Washington D.C. for a conference because he was working for Governor Jerry Brown's office in San Francisco. Then, in 1979 he returned to D.C. for the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights as one of the coordinators. Because he was a coordinator, he went a week early and then stayed a week later for his vacation only to return a month later. After two weeks in San Francisco, he decided that he wanted to live in D.C. In the 80's Abdullah began his tenure at Georgetown University and spent several years at Beijing University and Taiwan National University Beijing University. He studied the Chinese language and literature, and later Arabic, Arabic Linguistics, North African, and Middle Eastern Studies, and several years working and studying in Muslim countries. Some of his classmates were from √úr√ºmqi, and were Chinese Muslims. They asked him what he knew of Islam, which led to being invited to his very first Beijing Mosque. At this first mosque, Abdullah understood everything that was being said and knew this was the faith he had been searching for. At age 30, he became a Muslim and chose to sometimes go by the name Daayiee Abdullah. He didn't add on the title Imam until later. Around 2000, he joined the online Yahoo! group Muslim Gay Men. On this forum, there were many who were gay, but were intent on telling those who were seeking help that the Qur'an forbids homosexuality. Abdullah refuted these comments by explaining that one is to follow the Qur'an first and the Haddith second. Through this, he began to gain popularity among homosexuals and allies across the online community. One of the reasons he had begun to be called Imam was because he has performed many ceremonies for people in who were considered pariahs in their community due to illnesses or the gender or religion of the person they wished to marry. A few gay Muslims died of AIDS, and no one would do their Janazah. Abdullah also performed same-sex marriages for men and women and counseling for all couples‚Äîheterosexual and homosexual. Along with performing these ceremonies that others would not, he married mixed couples and religiously differing couples who are from the Abrahamic faith. Because the Abrahamic faiths are sister religions, and because the Qu'ran says that Abrahamic believers can interact with other Abrahamic believers, Abdullah believes that it is plausible to marry between Abrahamic religions. He was the business manager at Georgetown Fitness Center from 2007 to 2009. Abdullah, under his legal name Sidney Thompson, is the CEO of Asiad & Associates, a software company in Washington, D.C. =Masjid Nur Al-Isslaah= Abdullah created an LGBT-friendly masjid in Washington D.C. Later, in 2011, he helped create a mosque for anyone who wanted to attend located in a public library in D.C. The plan is to raise funds to create a purpose-built mosque of their own where all are free to worship. Since 2000, Abdullah has provided specialized counseling services for Muslims from a wide spectrum of Muslim religious and cultural backgrounds. Abdullah is the imam and religious director of Masjid Nur Al-Isslaah (English: \\"Mosque for Enlightenment and Reformation\\" or \\"Light of Reform Mosque\\"), an LGBT-welcoming mosque. Imam Daayiee was Director of LGBT Outreach at Muslims for Progressive Values from 2010 until 2014 and remains on the Advisory Board of Muslims for Progressive Values.

He was transported to Virginia as a young boy and sold into slavery. He came to Watford, Hertfordshire in around 1765, as a servant for the Earl of Essex at Cassiobury House, continuing to serve the family for 44 years. He achieved respect and status at Cassiobury House and was baptised at St Mary's Church, Watford on 1 August 1774. George Capel-Coningsby, 5th Earl of Essex and the Countess of Essex were among the list of subscribers to the autobiography of Olaudah Equiano, a former slave who was influential in the abolitionist movement. Depiction in art An unfinished painting from c.1809, 'Harvest Home', painted by J.M.W. Turner on his second visit to Cassiobury, depicts a black servant at a harvest dinner in one of the barns at Cassiobury House. Black figures have featured in many Western paintings, but were typically shown at the edge of the canvas as peripheral, subordinate characters; Turner's positioning of the servant in the main group of people is thought to indicate that this was a high-ranking servant in the Cassiobury household, and it is likely that this is Doney himself. Death and Burial Doney died a freeman in 1809, two years after the British abolition of the Atlantic slave trade. His burial at St Mary's Church took place on 8 September 1809 and a handsome headstone with an original poetical epigraph was erected in the churchyard. The gravestone was given Grade II listed status in 2008.  References   External links  , George Edward Doney's involvement with the abolition movement?

It was established on 27 September 2012 as a permanent firewall for the eurozone, to safeguard and provide instant access to financial assistance programmes for member states of the eurozone in financial difficulty, with a maximum lending capacity of ‚Ç¨500 billion. It replaces two earlier temporary EU funding programmes: the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM). All new bailouts for any eurozone member state will now be covered by ESM, while the EFSF and EFSM will continue to handle money transfers and programme monitoring for the previously approved bailout loans to Ireland, Portugal and Greece. The Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism stipulated that the organization would be established if member states representing 90% of its capital requirements ratified the founding treaty. This threshold was surpassed with Germany's completion of the ratification process on 27 September 2012, which brought the treaty into force on that date for sixteen of the seventeen members of the eurozone. The remaining state, Estonia, which had only committed 0.19% of the capital, completed its ratification on 4 October 2012.ESM Treaty details A separate treaty, amending Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) to authorize the establishment of the ESM under EU law, was planned to enter into force on 1 January 2013. However, the last of the then-27 European Union member states to complete their ratification of this amendment, the Czech Republic, did not do so until 23 April 2013, postponing its entry into force until 1 May 2013. The ESM commenced its operations after an inaugural meeting on 8 October 2012. The first 40% of the paid-in capital was transferred by all ESM member states ahead of a treaty regulated deadline of 12 October 2012. ESM member states can apply for a bailout if they are in financial difficulty or their financial sector is a stability threat in need of recapitalization. ESM bailouts are conditional on member states first signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), outlining a programme for the needed reforms or fiscal consolidation to be implemented in order to restore the financial stability. Another precondition for receiving an ESM bailout is that the member state must have ratified the European Fiscal Compact. When applying for ESM support, the country in concern is analyzed and evaluated on all relevant financial stability matters by the so-called Troika (European Commission, ECB and IMF) in order to decide which of its five different kinds of support programmes should be offered. As of April 2013, the ESM has approved two Financial Assistance Facility Agreement (FAFA) programmes, with up to ‚Ç¨100bn earmarked for recapitalization of Spanish Banks, and ‚Ç¨9bn in disbursements for Cyprus for a sovereign state bailout programme. The Cyprus bank recapitalization was funded by converting bank deposits into equity. History Following the European sovereign debt crisis that resulted in the lending of money to EU states, there has been a drive to reform the functioning of the eurozone in the event of a crisis. This led to the creation, amongst other things, of a loan mechanism: the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM). These, together with the International Monetary Fund, would lend money to EU states in trouble, in the same way that the European Central Bank can lend money to European banks. However, the EFSF and EFSM were intended only as a temporary measure (to expire in 2013), in part due to the lack of a legal basis in the EU treaties. In order to resolve the issue, the German government felt a treaty amendment would be required. After the difficult ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, many states and statesmen opposed reopening treaty amendment and the British government opposes changes affecting the United Kingdom.Van Rompuy wants clearer 'hierarchy' to deal with future crises, by Honor Mahony, EUobserver, 25.05.2010Don't expect Britain to back a new EU treaty, Cameron tells Merkel, by Tony Paterson, The Independent, 22.05.2010 However, after winning the support of French President Nicolas SarkozyBattle over treaty change divides Europe ahead of summit, by Leigh Phillips, EUobserver, 28.10.2010 Germany won support from the European Council in October 2010 for a new treaty. It would be a minimal amendment to strengthen sanctions and create a permanent lending- out mechanism. It would not fulfil the German demand to have the removal of voting rights as a sanction as that would require deeper treaty amendment. The treaty would be designed so there would be no need for referendums, providing the basis for a speedy ratification process, with the aim to have it completely ratified and come into force in July 2012. In that case, it was to co-exist with the temporary lending-out mechanism (EFSF) for one year, as EFSF was set only to expire as a rescue facility at 1 July 2013. Treaty basis =Article 136 amendment of TFEU= On 16 December 2010 the European Council agreed a two line amendment to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU),EUROPEAN COUNCIL 16‚Äì17 DECEMBER 2010 CONCLUSIONS, European Council 17 December 2010 that would give the ESM legal legitimacyPhillips, Leigh (17 December 2010) EU leaders agree to tweak treaty, keep bail-out fund unchanged, EU Observer and was designed to avoid any referendums. The amendment simply changes the EU treaties to allow for a permanent mechanism to be established.EUROPEAN COUNCIL 16-17 DECEMBER 2010 CONCLUSIONS, European Council 17 December 2010 In March of the following year leaders also agreed to a separate eurozone-only treaty that would create the ESM itself.EUROPEAN COUNCIL 24/25 MARCH 2011 CONCLUSIONS In March 2011, the European Parliament approved the treaty amendment after receiving assurances that the European Commission, rather than EU states, would play 'a central role' in running the ESM, despite wishing it had been more involved earlier,Parliament approves Treaty change to allow stability mechanism, European ParliamentRetrieved 22 March 2011 Published 22 March 2011 and it was signed by all 27 EU member states on 25 March 2011. The amendment reads: The amendment authorises the eurozone countries to establish a stability mechanism to protect the common currency, within EU law. This mean, that the existing intergovernmental treaty having established ESM outside of the EU framework with entry into force 27 September 2012, might subsequently be transposed to become part of the EU framework once this TFEU article 136 amendment enters into force. The ESM established by the intergovernmental treaty was designed to be fully compatible with existing EU law, and the European Court of Justice ruled in November 2012 - that \\"the right of a Member State to conclude and ratify the ESM Treaty is not subject to the entry into force\\" of the TFEU amendment. The TFEU amendment came into force on 1 May 2013, after the Czech Republic became the last member state to ratify the agreement according to its respective constitutional requirements. In June 2015, an updated EMU reform plan was released which envisaged that in the medium-term (between July 2017 and 2025) the ESM should be transposed from being an intergovernmental agreement to become fully integrated into the EU law framework applying to all eurozone member states under the competence provided for by the amended article 136 of the TFEU. =Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism= In addition to the \\"TFEU amendment\\" treaty, the European Stability Mechanism itself was established by a treaty among the eurozone states, named the Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism, which sets out the details of how the ESM would operate. Formally, two treaties with this name were signed: one on 11 July 2011 and one on 2 February 2012, after the first turned out not to be substantial enough the second version was produced to \\"make it more effective\\". The 2012 version was signed by all 17 Eurozone members on 2 February 2012, and was planned to be ratified and enter force by mid-2012, when the EFSF and EFSM were set to expire. The treaty was concluded exclusively by eurozone states, amongst others because the UK refused to participate in any fiscal integration.Van Rompuy wants clearer 'hierarchy' to deal with future crises, by Honor Mahony, EUobserver, 25 May 2010Don't expect Britain to back a new EU treaty, Cameron tells Merkel, by Tony Paterson, The Independent, 22 May 2010 The Treaty establishing the ESM entered into force on 27 September 2012 for 16 signatories. Estonia completed their ratification on 3 October 2012, six days after the treaty entered into force. However, the inaugural meeting of the ESM didn't occur until 8 October, after the treaty's entry into force for Estonia. Latvia's adoption of the euro on 1 January 2014 was given final approval by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council on 9 July, making them eligible to apply for ESM membership. Following Latvia's government giving their consent to joining to the ESM in November 2013, the acceded on 21 February 2014. The treaty entered into force for them on 13 March 2014. Latvia's contribution to the ESM will be ‚Ç¨325 million. Lithuania adopted the euro on 1 January 2015, and acceded to the ESM on 14 January 2015. They became a member on 3 February 2015. Organization The ESM is an intergovernmental organization established under public international law, and located in Luxembourg City. It has about 145 personnel, who are also responsible for the EFSF. The organization is led by a managing director appointed for a 5-year term. The first managing director Klaus Regling was appointed in 2012. Each member state appoints a governor (and alternate) for the board of governors, which can either be chaired by the President of the Euro Group or by a separate elected chair from amongst the governors themselves. In 2012, Jean-Claude Juncker (Luxembourg) was appointed to this position. The board consists of Ministers of Finance of the member states. The Board of Directors consists of 19 members \\"of high competence in economic and financial matters\\". Each member state appoints one Director and an alternate. =Financial support instruments= ESM member states can apply for an ESM bailout if they are in financial difficulty or their financial sector is a stability threat in need of recapitalization. ESM bailouts are conditional on member states first signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), outlining a programme for the needed reforms or fiscal consolidation to be implemented in order to restore the financial stability. Another precondition for receiving an ESM bailout, starting from 1 March 2013, will be that the member state must have fully ratified the European Fiscal Compact. When applying for ESM support, the country in concern will be analyzed and evaluated on all relevant financial stability matters by the so-called Troika (European Commission, ECB and IMF) in order to decide if one/several of these 5 different kind of support programmes should be offered: # Stability support loan within a macro-economic adjustment programme (Sovereign Bailout Loan): \\"To be granted if it is no longer sustainable for the state to draw on capital markets, when seeking to cover the state's financial needs. The signed conditional MoU agreement will focus on requirements for fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to improve the sovereign financial stability.\\" # Bank recapitalisation programme: \\"To be granted if the roots of a crisis situation are primarily located in the financial sector and not directly related to fiscal or structural policies at the state level, with the government seeking to finance a recapitalisation at sustainable borrowing costs. ESM will only offer a bank recapitalisation support package, if it can be established that neither the private market nor the member state will be able to conduct the needed recapitalisation on their own, without causing increased financial stress/instability. The size of the needed recapitalisation shall be determined by a stress test, calculating the amount needed for a complete financial sector repair to eliminate all vulnerabilities. Support from this ESM package is earmarked for bank recapitalisation, and cannot be used for any other purpose. The signed conditional MoU agreement will likewise only cover requirements for reform/changes to the financial sector, within the domains of financial supervision, corporate governance and domestic laws relating to restructuring/resolution.\\" # Precautionary financial assistance (PCCL/ECCL): \\"Comprise support in the form of setting up available \\"credit lines\\" the ESM member state can draw on if suddenly needed. This support shall be offered to ESM members whose economic conditions are currently sound enough to maintain continuous access to market financing, but being in a fragile situation calling for the setup of an adequate safety-net (financial guarantee), to help ensure a continued access to market financing. The signed conditional MoU agreement will focus on requirements for fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to improve the sovereign financial stability.\\" # Primary Market Support Facility (PMSF): \\"Bond purchase operations in the primary market could be made by ESM, in complement to offering regular loans under a macro-economic adjustment programme or to drawdown of funds under a precautionary programme. This instrument would be used primarily towards the end of an adjustment programme to facilitate a country‚Äôs return to draw on the market, and reduce the risk of a failed bond auction. The aim is for the private market to subscribe to 50% of the bond auction while ESM cover the remaining 50%. If the participation of the private market proves to be insignificant the PMSF will be cancelled, and replaced by an extra transfer of funds from the macro-economic/precautionary programme. There will be no additional MoU agreement for this support package, as the conditions will be identical to the pre-existing Sovereign bailout loan / Precautionary programme.\\" # Secondary Market Support Facility (SMSF): \\"This facility aims to support the good functioning of the government debt markets of ESM Members in exceptional circumstances where the lack of market liquidity threatens financial stability, with a risk of pushing sovereign interest rates towards unsustainable levels and creating refinancing problems for the banking system of the ESM Member concerned. An ESM secondary market intervention is intended to enable market-making that would ensure some debt market liquidity and incentivise investors to further participate in the financing of ESM Members. The instrument can be offered either as a stand alone support, or in combination with support from any of the other 4 instruments. No additional MoU agreement will be needed for ESM members already receiving a Sovereign bailout loan/Precautionary programme; but a non- programme country (being sound in regards of financial stability; except for thef liquidity issue), will obviously need to sign a MoU agreement with the policy conditions outlined by the European Commission in liaison with the ECB.\\" In order to further help increase the financial stability of the eurozone, the ECB decided on 6 September 2012 to automatically run a free unlimited amount of yield-lowering bond purchases (OMT support programme) for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout or precautionary programme from EFSF/ESM, if -and for as long as- the country is found to suffer from stressed bond yields at excessive levels; but only at the point of time where the country possesses/regain a complete market funding access -and only if the country still complies with all terms in the signed MoU- agreement.\\"Technical features of Outright Monetary Transactions\\", ECB Press Release, 6 September 2012 Countries receiving a precautionary programme rather than a sovereign bailout, will per definition have complete market access and thus qualify for OMT support if also suffering from stressed interest rates on its government bonds. In regards to countries receiving a sovereign bailout (Ireland, Portugal and Greece), they will on the other hand not qualify for OMT support before they have regained complete market access, which the ECB define as the moment when the state succeeds to issue a new ten-year government bond series at the private capital market. Initially, EFSF and ESM were only allowed to offer financial stability loans directly to sovereign states, meaning that offered bank recapitalisation packages were first paid to the state and then transferred to the suffering financial sector; and thus these type of loans were accounted for as national debt of the sovereign state - adversely impacting its gross debt-to-GDP ratio and credit rating. For example, this regime was utilized when ESM established a bank recapitalization support programme for Spain in 2012‚Äì13. On the EU summit on 19 October 2012, it was decided that ESM bank recapitalisation packages in the future (starting from the date when ECBs new supervision unit for the financial sector has been set to commence operations: 4 November 2014), instead only shall by paid directly to the financial sector, so that it no longer counts as state debt in the statistics. ESM made the decided \\"direct bank recapitalization\\" framework operational starting from December 2014, as a new novel ultimate backstop instrument to apply for systemic banks in their recovery/resolution phase, if such banks will be found in need to receive additional recapitalization funds after conducted bail-in by private creditors and regulated payment by the Single Resolution Fund. In this way, the primary backstop to patch future uncovered recapitalization needs of a failing systemic bank will be provided by bail-in of private creditors along with contributions from the Single Resolution Fund (as regulated by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive), while the ESM \\"direct bank recapitalization\\" instrument only will be needed as an \\"ultimate backstop\\" for the most extreme cases where the primary backstop funds are found to be insufficient. Contributions The ESM is expected to have an authorised capital of 700 billion euros of which 80 billion is paid-in capital, and the remaining 620 billion, if needed, will be loaned through the issuance of some special ESM obligations at the capital markets. The ESM treaty foresees a payment of the capital in five annual instalments, but the Eurogroup decided on 30 March 2012 that capital payments shall be accelerated and all the capital paid by the first half of 2014.

As the ESM lending capacity depends on the amount of paid-in capital, it will start out only to be ‚Ç¨200bn in Q4-2012, and then be increased with ‚Ç¨100bn each time one of the remaining three capital transfers ticks in. If needed, a majority of the ESM board can also decide to accelerate the payment schedule. On 1 May 2013, ESM has reconfirmed the schedule for receiving paid-in capital, with the third tranch already received in April 2013 followed by the fourth in October 2013, with the final fifth tranch scheduled for April 2014. Lending activities The Troika currently negotiates with Spain and Cyprus, about setting up an economic recovery programme in return of providing support with financial loans from ESM. Cyprus so far applied both for a ‚Ç¨6bn sovereign bailout loan and a ‚Ç¨5bn bank recapitalisation package. Cyprus could however perhaps also be interested in additional support packages from instrument 3/4/5. Reportedly Spain beside of applying for a ‚Ç¨100bn bank recapitalisation package in June 2012, now also follow a path of negotiations to get financial support from a Precautionary Conditioned Credit Line (PCCL) package. If Spain will apply and receive a PCCL package, irrespectively to what extent it subsequently decides to draw on this established credit line, this would at the same time immediately qualify the country also to receive \\"free\\" additional financial support from ECB, in the form of some yield-lowering bond purchases (OMT). =Bailout programmes for EU members since 2008=  Critics  Critics have noted that the ESM severely confines the economic sovereignty of its member states and criticise that it provides extensive powers and immunity to the board of ESM Governors without parliamentary influence or control.Common Concerns: Austria: Objections and Reservations to ESM (European Stability Mechanism) Think-tanks such as the World Pensions Council (WPC) have argued that the European Stability Mechanism is the product of a short-term political consensus, and thus won't be conductive of a durable, cohesive institutional solution. In their perspective, a profound revision of the Lisbon Treaty itself is unavoidable if Germany is to succeed in imposing its economic views, as stringent orthodoxy across the budgetary, fiscal and regulatory fronts will necessarily have to go beyond the treaty in its current form, thus further reducing the individual prerogatives of national governments.M. Nicolas J. Firzli, \\"Greece and the EU Debt Crisis\\" The Vienna Review, March 2010 ;Estonia In Estonia a group of MPs have called for a referendum on the treaty. On 8 August, during the first reading of the bill ratifying the ESM in Riigikogu, the Estonian Centre Party put forward a motion to reject the bill. However, this motion was defeated in parliament by 56 votes against, with 33 voting for. ;Germany In Germany some members of FDP (liberal party) and CSU (conservative Bavarian party), both minor parties of the previous government coalition, were against the European Stability Mechanism.Welt:Liberale Euro-Rebellen haben fast 900 Unterschriften The Left, Pirate Party Germany and NPD also oppose the ESM, the latter comparing it with the Enabling Act of 1933.

Further developments The New Hanseatic League, established in February 2018 by like-minded finance ministers from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Sweden, is pushing to develop the European Stability Mechanism into a full European Monetary Fund that would redistribute wealth from trade surplus to trade deficit EU member states.

He was born on 10 November 1920 in Frontignan, H√©rault, and died on 23 April 1979 in Asquins, Yonne. Youth Maurice Clavel was born on 10 November 1920 in a family headed by a father who was a pharmacist. This conservative milieu of small shopkeepers in Languedoc led him to be an activist in the French Popular Party (FPP) in his hometown of Frontignan. A brilliant pupil, he got into the prestigious √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris. There he became acquainted with Trotskyist Jean-Toussaint Desanti and Maurrassian Pierre Boutang. The latter, having been appointed in the Secretariat of Public Instruction, invited him to serve by his side under Marshal Philippe P√©tain. Having just gotten his certificate of morale and sociology in Montpellier, Maurice Clavel accepted but was soon disillusioned. While preparing a thesis on Immanuel Kant, he then joined the R√©sistance (1942). As head the French Forces of the Interior of Eure-et-Loir, he took part in the liberation of Chartres where he greeted General Charles de Gaulle on the cathedral's forecourt. At the Lib√©ration, he denounced the blind epuration and tried to save the heads of Robert Brasillach and Drieu La Rochelle. That did not prevent him from being a fervent activist in the Rally of the French People (RPF) whose acerbic criticism of communism got him to be accused by the French Communist Party (PCF) of being \\"Goebbel's voice\\". He then founded with Henri d'Astier de La Vigerie and Andr√© Figueras a newspaper called L'Essor. Meanwhile, he wrote plays directed by Jean Vilar like Les Incendiaires (The Incendiaries) in 1947 or La Terrasse de midi (The Noon Terrace) in 1949. But those failed, and as he was torn apart after breaking his relationship with comedian Silvia Monfort, Clavel accepted a professor tenure in the Carnot high school in Dijon. Barely liked by his superiors, he soon got back to theatrical works when, in 1951, Jean Vilar appointed him as secretary-general of the Th√©√¢tre National Populaire. But his new play Malsameda (1954) as well as his first novel Une fille pour l'√©t√© (A Girl for the Summer, 1955) turned out to be failures too. Journalist =From 1955 to 1965= From 1955, Clavel started his career as a journalist writing in Combat. Protesting, among other things, against the invasion of Hungary by Soviet tanks in 1956, and the use of torture in Algeria, he got involved with left-wing Gaullists in the Democratic Union of Labour in 1959. Meanwhile, he went back to teaching as philosophy professor in Camille S√©e and Buffon high school in Paris, from 1960 to 1963. With Emmanuel Berl, he presented a daily radio programme Qui √™tes- vous ? (Who are you?). But after the refusal by managers of the radio station to grant Jean Daniel a right of reply about Algeria, he resigned. The following year, after publishing Le Temps de Chartres (The Times of Chartres), he ceased his regular contribution to Combat. However he kept supporting General De Gaulle's position on Algeria, who entrusted him to engage in a dialogue with Messali Hadj. But the year 1965 marked a fracture in his political and philosophical evolution. First, he regained faith in the Catholic religion, a conversion triggered by his reading of a book by Paul Cochois about Pierre de B√©rulle, the founder of the Oratorians congregation. Later, the Ben Barka affair in October of the same year led him to distance himself from De Gaulle. In an op-ed published in Le Monde on 15 June 1966 he sanctioned his breaking with the General while announcing to the press his availability to follow the Ben Barka trial as a judicial commentator. Thus he was contacted by Hector de Galard to follow the affair for Le Nouvel Observateur, starting in September 1966. =After 1965= Clavel started his contribution to Le Nouvel Observateur with virulent articles against the power, denouncing among others \\"the sharks and the gudgeons\\" (October 19, 1966). The following year he contributed to the newspaper's TV column while keeping writing in Combat, and publishing novels such as La Pourpre de Jud√©e (The Crimson of Judea) or Les D√©lices du genre humain (The Delights of Mankind, 1967). May 1968 radicalised his political involvement. Perceiving the events of May as a \\"uprise of life\\" from a youth weary of consumption society, he found the revolutionary unrest similar to a party and even wished to lead the demonstrators on 13 May to assault the √âlys√©e Palace. Within Le Nouvel Observateur, he supported the managers in the name of the need for a responsible management, the loneliness of columnists, and individual responsibility. But outside he went to serve the most radical elements of the contestation leading him to leave his tenure as philosophy professor in Buffon highschool. He won the Prix M√©dicis for Le Tiers des √©tioles in 1972.

If it had become operational with coal, the Kemper Project would have been a first-of-its-kind electricity plant to employ gasification and carbon capture technologies at this scale. Project management problems had been noted at the Kemper Project. The plant was supposed to be in service by May 2014, at a cost of $2.4 billion. As of June 2017, the project was still not in service, and the cost had increased to $7.5 billion. According to a Sierra Club analysis, Kemper is the most expensive power plant ever built, based on its generating capacity.

Lignite  Lignite is a soft, brownish-black coal that has the lowest energy content of any type of coal. It is also very dirty when burned.\\"Fossil Energy Study Guide: Coal\\", energy.gov. Lignite coal According to the Lignite Energy Council about 79 percent of lignite coal is used to generate electricity, 13.5 percent to generate synthetic natural gas, and 7.5 percent to produce fertilizer products. Mississippi has an estimated five billion tons of coal reserves, consisting almost entirely of eocene lignite. The typical lignite beds that can be economically mined range from two to nine feet thick. Mississippi's lignite resources equal about 13 percent of total U.S. lignite reserves. The Kemper plant was expected to use about 375,000 tons of locally mined lignite per month or almost 185 million tons over the plant's expected 40-year life. TRIG technology can utilize lignite, which is also a driving factor of the technology. Technology Mississippi Power's Kemper plant was intended to be an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) facility, utilizing a technology known as \\"transport integrated gasification\\" (TRIG) to convert lignite coal‚Äîmined on the Kemper site‚Äîinto natural gas. The natural gas would then have been used to power turbines to generate electricity. Mississippi Power stated that, by adding coal to its sources of power, it wished to add balance to its fuel-source choices, and be less reliant on any one form of energy. There is an estimated four billion tons of lignite available to be used. If successful, the Kemper Project would have been the second TRIG facility in the United States. Producing electricity from coal in this way produces tremendous amounts of carbon dioxide, and Mississippi Power hoped that 65 percent of the carbon dioxide would be captured and utilized in Enhanced Oil Recovery at neighboring oil fields. =Transport integrated gasification technology= TRIG was developed by the Department of Energy, Southern Company and KBR at the Power Systems Development Facility in Wilsonville, Alabama. Southern Company stated that TRIG is a superior coal- gasification method with low impacts to the environment. TRIG technology can utilize lignite, which accounts for more than half of the world's coal reserves and drove global interest in the plant. Power Magazine posted an article in April 2013, walking through the technology in technical detail. They say, \\"Commercial TRIG units can be designed to achieve high environmental standards for , NOx, dust emissions, mercury, and . Cost analysis based on extensive design has shown that the economic benefits offered by the air-blown transport gasifier relative to other systems are preserved even when capture and sequestration are incorporated into the design.\\" =Clean coal= If the carbon, capture and sequestration technology used at the Kemper Project had been successful, it would have been the United States‚Äô first clean coal plant. The need for this type of technology has come from decades of debate among energy leaders on how to minimize carbon dioxide emissions into the earth's atmosphere. In 2013, the United States' coal use was 40%, dominating all other energy sources. Realizing the demand for coal was not decreasing, Mississippi Power, Southern Company, KBR, and the Department of Energy invested in technology to capture emissions from burning fossil fuels. The investing bodies argued the type of clean coal technology they claim are found at the Kemper Project will be adopted worldwide; bringing profits back to Mississippi customers. Environmentalists state that clean coal is not a possibility, as some emissions will still be emitted into the atmosphere. =Carbon capture and sequestration= Carbon capture and sequestration, also referred to as carbon capture and storage (CCS), is a technology that can capture up to 90% of the carbon dioxide () emissions. CCS uses a combination of technologies to capture the released in the combustion process, transport it to a suitable storage location and finally store it (typically deep underground) where it cannot enter the atmosphere and thus contribute to climate change. sequestration options include saline formations and oil wells, where captured can be utilized in enhanced oil recovery. Due to rising global demand for energy, the consumption of fossil fuels is expected to rise until 2035, leading to greater emissions. =Carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery= Carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery or CO2-EOR increases the amount of oil recovered from an underground oil reservoir. By pumping into an oil reservoir, previously unrecoverable oil is pushed up to where the oil can be reached. The US Department of Energy states that this can produce an additional 30 to 60 percent of the original amount of recoverable oil. Once all of the recoverable oil has been reached, the depleted reservoir can act as a storage site for the . The Kemper Plant was planned to have 60 miles of pipeline to carry its captured to neighboring oil reserves for enhanced oil recovery. Each year, the plant will capture 3 million tons of . In March 2014, The Guardian published that the diverted will be pumped into two Mississippi companies for use in enhanced oil recovery. Research & development The Department of Energy, the Southern Company, and construction management firm KBR (Kellogg, Brown & Root) joined together at the Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF) in Wilsonville, Alabama to develop a process known as Transport Integrated Gasification (TRIG). This development started in 1996, and the gasifier design of Southern Company's Kemper Coal Plant is based on this specific research and development. The technology is most cost-effective when using low-heat content, high moisture, or high-ash content coals, including lignite. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, coal gasification offers one of the most versatile and clean ways to convert coal into electricity, hydrogen, and other valuable energy products. Rather than burning coal directly, gasification (a thermo-chemical process) breaks down coal into its basic chemical constituents. The technology of processing coal to gas on a commercial scale has been in development since the 1970s, and it has been in use since the mid-1980s. The TRIG technology, derived from fluidized catalytic cracking units used in the petrochemical industry, uses a pressurized, circulating fluidized bed unit. The transport gasification system features higher efficiencies and is capable of processing low-rank coals, such as lignite. Additionally, commercial TRIG units can be designed to achieve high environmental standards for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, dust emissions, mercury, and carbon dioxide. Cost analysis based on the Kemper Coal Plant's design has shown that the economic benefits offered by the air-blown transport gasifier, relative to other systems, are preserved even when carbon dioxide capture and sequestration methodologies are incorporated into the design. The largest transport gasifier built to date commenced operation in 1996 at Southern Company's PSDF. The gasifier and auxiliary equipment at the site were sized to provide reliable data for confident scale-up to commercial scale. The demonstration unit proved easy to operate and control, achieving more than 15,600 hours of gasification. The demonstration-scale gasifier successfully gasified high-moisture lignite from the Red Hills Mine in Mississippi in four separate test campaigns for more than 2,300 hours of operations. On lignite, the transport gasifier operated smoothly over a range of conditions, confirming the gasifier design for Kemper County. Legal issues In February 2015, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled Mississippi Power must refund 186,000 South Mississippi ratepayers for rate increases related to the Kemper Project. These fees are derived from Mississippi's Baseload Act, allowing Mississippi Power to charge ratepayers for powerplants under construction. In May 2016, Southern Company and its subsidiary Mississippi Power announced they were being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to overruns at the Kemper Project. The project had been repeatedly delayed and costs increased from $2.88 billion to $6.7 billion. In June 2016, Mississippi Power was sued by Treetop Midstream Services over the cancellation of a contract to receive carbon dioxide from the Kemper Project as part of the carbon capture and storage design. Treetop had contracted to buy carbon dioxide from the Kemper plant and had built a pipeline in preparation to receive the gas. Treetop alleged Mississippi Power had fraudulently and \\"intentionally misrepresenting and concealing the start date\\" for the Kemper Project, though Mississippi Power stated the suit was without merit. The company was also found to have unlawfully fired a whistle-blower who had criticized alleged false statements by company management. Environmental controversies Environmental groups argue that the project is an expensive undertaking that offers only limited benefits. Groups such as the Sierra Club and Bridge the Gulf are encouraging the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to deny the required wetland permits, which Mississippi Company would have to fill to build the plant's facilities. The Mississippi Chapter of the Sierra Club is arguing that the location where the facilities are planned to be built needs to be left alone. They argue that the position of the facilities on a wetland will pollute the environment with tainted water runoff. Also, they believe that the extraction of the lignite will erode the environment and force the relocation of many Mississippians. Mitigation construction activities included the enhancement of 31 acres of wetlands, 105 acres of riparian buffer, and approximately 3,000 linear feet of stream channel. In an agreement with the city of Meridian, the plant is using city wastewater as its only water source. Additionally, the Kemper Project site is a \\"zero\\" liquid discharge facility. Therefore, no processed water from the plant is discharged into rivers, creeks or streams. Political controversies Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour has praised the planned project's potential of placing Mississippi in national prominence, mostly because it would be the first U.S. commercial-scale power plant to capture carbon. Additionally, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich expressed his support for the Kemper Project, stating that in his opinion it had the potential to be the single most important experiment in developing electricity in the world today. Gingrich's closing words of encouragement for the Kemper Project and the state of Mississippi: \\"You have a chance to be a remarkable leader in the country in the next 10 to 20 years.\\" The Kemper Project received an estimated $270 million in Department of Energy funds after the Southern Company's plan for the proposed Orlando Gasification Project bunked when Florida decided the state was not interested in more coal plants. These transferred funds were moved from Florida to Mississippi in December 2008, after Haley Barbour's Washington D.C. lobbying firm, the BGR Group, pushed for the reallocation. Southern Company has been a BGR client since 1999, having spent a total of $2.6 million with the firm, according to federal lobbying disclosure documents. Southern Company alleges that Governor Barbour did not help them receive any additional funding at all. The BGR Group website has deleted all connections with Southern Company from its website. Mississippi state law was changed to permit charging ratepayers for construction of the facility. In 2017 the Mississippi Public Service Commission recommended the facility burn natural gas rather than syngas from coal to avoid the risk of further consumer rate increases. The plant missed all its targets and plans for \\"clean coal\\" generation were abandoned in July 2017. The plant is expected to go ahead burning natural gas only.

The lunette was part of the Civil War defenses of Washington (see Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War). The lunette stood less than a mile away from Arlington House, the Union-occupied estate of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. It remained in use throughout the war. The lunette was part of the Arlington Line. It tied into Fort Tillinghast approximately 0.6 miles to the north and Fort Albany approximately 0.9 miles to the south. The fortification helped guard the capital from an approach along the Columbia Turnpike and over the Long Bridge on the Potomac River. Construction Col. William H.

Presley O. Craig, 2nd U.S. Artillery Regiment, who was killed at the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861. Oriented to the southwest, it had a perimeter of 324 yards, emplacements for 11 guns, and 2 magazines. The fort's armament included four 24-pound guns, one 24-pound field howitzer, five 30-pound Parrott rifles, a 10-inch mortar, and a 24-pound Coehorn mortar. Units garrisoned at the lunette included the 1st Massachusetts Heavy Artillery, 138th Ohio Infantry, 6th Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery, and 16th Maine Infantry.

Peter the Great had assembled a force of 20,000 men for this task, and marched for ten days to his destination. About 12,000 of these men were positioned on the banks of the Neva river, where they camped until 6 October (N.S.). On that day, after giving command of the main force to Boris Sheremetev, he moved toward N√∂teborg. After the Swedish commander, Wilhelm von Schlippenbach, refused to give up the fort immediately, the Russians began bombarding it. A final Russian assault on the fort was tactically unsuccessful, resulting in heavy casualties, but forced the fort's defenders to surrender on 22 October 1702. After taking control, Peter immediately began reconstructing the fort for his own purposes, renaming it Shlisselburg. Swedish defences N√∂teborg was initially defended by a small garrison of no more than 220 men, with 142 cannons of small caliber. However, during the course of the siege it was reinforced with about 240 men. Under the command of the old colonel Gustav Wilhelm von Schlippenbach, the brother of the Swedish general commanding in Livonia, Wolmar Anton von Schlippenbach.Peter Ullgren, Det stora nordiska kriget 1700-1721 (2008) Stockholm, Prisma. Sida 142. The last party of reinforcements arrived on 18 October under the command of Hans Georg Leijon; it consisted of about 50 grenadiers, only 34 of whom reached the fortress defence due to the shortage of boats. On Leijon's arrival only 225 remaining soldiers were fit for duty, the rest had been killed or wounded by the artillery bombardment, or suffered disease.Bengt Nilsson Historia The defences of the fortress at that time consisted of a stone wall 28 feet high and 14 feet thick, with seven towers. Near the northeastern part of the fortress was a castle, which itself consisted of a stone wall and three towers. The main defence of the fortress was the Neva river itself, along with Lake Ladoga, which together encircled the entire fort. On the right bank of the Neva, about 3,000 yards (1.5 miles) from the main fort, there was a separate fortification, consisting of a sconce-type outwork, where a regiment was garrisoned to assist with communication with the main fort and transportation across the river. Siege A later illustration of the siege then of about twelve thousand men, Peter the Great and his army advanced to lay siege to the fortress of N√∂teborg. N√∂teborg had originally been built by the people of Novgorod four centuries earlier, under the name of Orekhovo or Oreshek, on a small island of the river Neva, just where it flows out from Lake Ladoga. However, it has been said that Torgils Knutsson was the first one to have fortified the island.http://wadbring.com/historia/sidor/ryssmedeltid.htm The island itself was in the shape of a hazel-nut, hence both the Russian and Swedish names. It served for a long time as a barrier against the incursions of the Swedes and Danes, and protected the commerce of Novgorod as well as of Ladoga. A few days after arriving at N√∂teborg, Peter sent a detachment of 400 men of the Preobrazhensky Regiment to take up positions closer to the fort and prepare for the arrival of a greater force. The troops destroyed two Swedish boats sent out for reconnaissance, but were fired upon from the fort. This did not stop them from performing their field preparations, and they lost only one man. The next day, the rest of the Preobrazhensky Regiment and Semenovsky Regiment arrived. The remainder of the Russians took up positions on both sides of the River Neva by 7 October, and during the next several days they were busy constructing artillery batteries, which were completed by 12 October. The difficult job of securing the outwork on the Neva's bank was handed over to the Preobrazhensky Regiment, which, at four o'clock in the morning of 12 October, embarked towards the far coast of the river. Under the leadership of the Czar himself, the Russians were successful in capturing the sconce, encountering little resistance. Upon its capture, further construction work began, and eventually the town was besieged from all sides. Using a fleet of small boats, which they brought down from the river Svir through Lake Ladoga, the Russians succeeded in completely blockading the fort. They then sent a letter to the Swedish commandant, Wilhelm von Schlippenbach, requiring that he surrender the fort. Schlippenbach requested a four-day wait to allow him to consult with General Arvid Horn, his superior, who was in Narva; however Russian forces opened fire on the same day. On 14 October the wife of the commandant sent a letter to the Russian field-marshal, in the name of the wives of the officers, asking that they be permitted to depart. Peter, wishing to lose no time, himself replied that he could not consent to put Swedish ladies to the discomfort of a separation from their husbands: if they desired to leave the fort, they could do so if they took their husbands with them. On 15 October, 300 Russian soldiers occupied some small islands which were closer to the enemy fort, with the help of earthworks. Assault on the fort An engraving of the siege by A Schoonebeek, 1703 Preparations to perform a final assault on the fort began on 20 October; siege ladders were distributed, and officers were told where they would strike the fort. Finally, on 22 October, Peter decided to perform the assault. At one o'clock in the morning, a fire broke out in the fort. Local hunters and men from the Preobrazhensky Regiment, among others, waited at the ready in landing boats, two miles away from the fort. At half-past two, mortar shots were fired, which was the signal to commence the attack. The Swedes deployed 95 men by the church roundel under the command of Major Leyon, and another 75 men by the basement roundel under the command of Major Charpentier. The remaining defenders spread out over the walls and fortifications. Schlippenbach had about 250 men under his command, which indicates that the Swedish had suffered about 200 casualties before the assault. The Russians launched their first assault, Swedish eyes witnessed 5,000 Russians crossing the river in their landing boats. Constantly under fire from muskets and cannons, they made an attempt to scale the breached walls while having the fort surrounded. Eventually, however, the assault was repulsed, largely due to the help of the Swedish grenadiers. In the second and third assaults, men from the Preobrazhensky and Semenovsky Regiments landed on the fort island and proceeded to erect escalades to scale the walls. The ladders turned out to be too short, but the attack continued. Fissures in the fortress wall formed choke points, and Russian troops took heavy casualties in their attempts to scale the fortress walls. Major Andrei Karpov was severely injured during the attack; Peter, upon receiving news of this and the other casualties, decided to call off the assault on the fort, but the orders did not reach the front lines. There are stories, considered unlikely, that Mikhail Golitsyn did, in fact, receive the orders, but refused to carry them out, telling the messenger to \\"tell the Czar that now I am not his, but God's,\\" implying that it was too late to withdraw. Golitsyn finally continued the attacks, and ordered the landing ships to depart, putting his troops in the position to choose either death or victory. Swedish surrender and aftermath Silver medals awarded for the capture of N√∂teborg Following the unrelenting but relatively fruitless assault on the fort by Russian forces, which lasted for 13 hours, the Swedish commandant accepted to capitulate on honorable conditions, realizing he could not defend the fortress for much longer. By then, the Russians had been able to take up position below one of the towers and had started mining. Another Russian force had managed to capture some houses just outside the gate, but these were set on fire by a Swedish detachment. To avoid massacre, Schlippenbach's whole garrison, with all their property, were allowed to depart to the next Swedish fort. According to Swedish sources, 83 soldiers left the N√∂teborg fortress in \\"good condition to fight\\", taking another 156 wounded or sick. They took four light artillery guns, leaving 138 remaining pieces behind. The Russians had lost more men than the whole Swedish garrison, in all almost 600 dead and around 1,000 wounded. Swedish sources mentions more than 2,000 Russian losses during the assault, and a total of 6,000 during the whole siege.http://runeberg.org/nfbt/0207.html Pages 377-378. Peter immediately proceeded to repair the damage done to the fort, renaming it Shlisselburg (from German Schl√ºsselburg - \\"key-city\\"). In the western bastion, the key given him by the Swedish commandant, a symbol that this fort was the key to the Neva, was built into the wall. When Peter was in St. Petersburg, he went to Schlisselburg every 2 November and feasted the capitulation. Menshikof, who had shown great military ability, was appointed governor of the newly named fort, and from this time dates his intimate friendship with Peter and his prominence in public life.

Personal life and education  Shannon was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin to parents John Kingsley Shannon, a Marine pilot and inventor, and Audrey Elizabeth Shannon. He has two brothers, John and James. Shannon attended the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. He received his MFA in 1971 from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. On September 26, 1990 Shannon married Catherine Matisse Monnier, a great granddaughter of Henri Matisse and granddaughter of Marcel Duchamp. Shannon and his family live in New York City.  Career  Shannon's work incorporates scientific themes. Shannon built Squat, an interactive robotic sculpture at his father's battery manufacturing plant in the summer of 1966. Squat won the Pauline Palmer Prize at the Chicago Art Institute that year in a show juried by James Speyer and Walter Hopps. Tom Shannon, Squat, 1966. Squat, made at 19 years old, was included in the landmark exhibition The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1969. It is considered a seminal work in robotic art.In 2019, \\"Squat\\" was restored under the direction of the artist by a team led by Robert Sieger, at Guardian Fine Art, Milwaukee, WI. Restored, \\"Squat\\" was a key work of art in a June-August 2019 exhibition of international sculpture, curated by Laura Sims Peck, at The Warehouse, Milwaukee, WI. The exhibition included work by twenty-one artists from twelve countries and three continents. During the run of the exhibition, Shannon presented an overview of his work which was videoed, and is the core of a new documentary film being made on Shannon's work and career. http:/www.thewarehousemke.org/exhibitions.html In 1981, the first of Shannon's large magnetically levitated sculptures, the seven-meter long Compass of Love, was exhibited in New York, then purchased by the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. The system of permanent magnets employed was designed by Shannon. In 1983, Shannon patented and produced an edition of 20 World Clocks with the participation of Fuller and Sadao's cartography. An example is in the collection of the Buckminster Fuller Institute and the Smithsonian American History Museum. Pontus Hulten, through the French Ministry of Culture, commissioned Shannon to make a major work for La Villette. Shannon designed a 17-meter diameter spherical array of computer-controlled RGB LED nodes equidistantly spaced like atoms in a crystal, called The Crystal Ball. . In 1991, the Moderna Museet in Stockholm purchased Shannon's first room-sized magnetic array, Compass Moon Atom Room. In 2000, Shannon commissioned Aerovironment to perform a feasibility study for Air Genie Video Airship. A US Patent was granted 2003. Shannon was commissioned by the Grande Palais in Paris to make a movie of his Airlands project (aka Outlands) for a major millennial show covering ten thousand years of Visions of the Future. Shannon, Parallel Universe, Shanghai. Installed in 2012. Photograph by Shannon, courtesy Tom Shannon Studio Archive. His sculptures have since been included in international exhibitions such as the Centre Pompidou, the Stedelijk Museum, Moderna Museet, the Venice Biennale, the Sao Paulo Biennial, the Biennale de Lyon, the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Art Tower Mito and the Whitney Museum. He was a featured artist at the 2003 TED Conference where he presented Air Genie, a spherical helium airship whose entire surface is a LED video screen. He also presented a series of paintings made by a remote-controlled pendulum in another TED talk in 2009.  Sculpture  Shannon's work is idea driven. His subject matter is that of existential conditions, i.e., the forces, properties, characteristics, proportions, the web of sensations and knowledge of which we are a part. For example, Ray (1986) is a sculpture of the spheres of the Sun and Earth in proportion, and the cone of energy, gravity, electromagnetic, luminous, that connects the two. Shannon makes magnetically levitated sculpture. The sculptures are suspended using permanent magnets. His series of suspended arrays includes room-filling three-dimensional crystalline arrangements of magnetic spheres each of which orient to Earth's magnetic field like a compass. His recent work includes large outdoor sculptures which behave as weightless objects. The sculpture's internal mechanisms consisted of axles, ball-bearings, universal joints, ball & sockets, fulcrums and massive counterweights, give them the ability to spin, tilt, rise/fall and glide horizontally and eventually return to equilibrium. Shannon designed the TED Prize, the Buckminster Fuller prizehttps://bfi.org/challenge/about and the Trophee Jules Verne installed at the Musee de la Marine in Paris. Shannon, Jules Verne Trophy, on display at the National Maritime Museum, Paris. In November 2019, the Science Museum Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, OK opened a year-long exhibition of new and older work by Shannon entitled \\"Tom Shannon: Universe in the Mind  Mind in the Universe\\". In the spring of 2020, 30-foot sculpture of Platonic solids will be installed at the entrance of the museum. sciencemuseumok.org  Paintings  Throughout his career Shannon has used several techniques for making paintings. At first he used traditional brush and ink (or watercolor or oil) to create paintings the subjects of which were typically projects he was working on or projects in a setting, such as a sculpture in a landscape. Shannon then developed \\"Evaporations,\\" a technique where aqueous paint was poured on a sheet of paper, and over time ‚Äì a few days or weeks ‚Äì the water would evaporate, leaving the pigment in dry \\"lakes\\" of color. An important concept in this painting technique is that the pigment is held \\"in suspension\\", a color particle, as it were, \\"floating\\" in a fluid. For Shannon, this was microscopic levitation, with a visual record of the pigment's \\"descent\\" onto a paper \\"ground\\". It was also for him a way to co-author a painting with nature, a lesson learned from John Cage. Another co-authoring with nature is Shannon's Trajectory series, where he tossed rubber balls wet with paint on inclined canvases, capturing the natural parabolic curve of the ball's path in gravity. The Paint Pendulum paintings are made using a radio- controlled six color pendulum paint dispenser of the artist's invention. The pendulum paint dispenser, controlled by the artist, released paint in discrete drops, like a very large inkjet printer, or smooth flowing streams of color. Recently in mid-2015, Shannon experimented with another painting format, which he calls Aerial Painting, where viewers can look at two-dimensional pattern on a canvas, which optically becomes a three-dimensional image, this without red and green glasses or other mechanical aids. \\"Looking 'through' a painting is something you do naturally,\\" said Shannon. \\"It's the same as gazing at a distant horizon. Your brain re-orders space on the canvas, creating a natural 3D space, where objects hover in front and behind the canvas.\\" An example of this technique is the painting \\"Mind Expansion.\\" For Shannon this is another form of levitation, one of the recurring themes of his work.

In the late 60's Shannon proposed spherical televisions linked to orbiting camera satellites. Buckminster Fuller had earlier proposed a 200-ft sphere covered with lights to display Earth to the United Nations. Shannon designed a LED-covered spherical blimp with cameras that could land at school campuses and other public locations to deliver education and at night host rave dances. Aerovironment, Inc., the engineering firm founded by aeronautics legend Paul MacCready, found the design feasible; it can be aerodynamically controlled and can present clear computer video in daylight.

His appearances included the final episode, \\"All That Glitters.\\" His first appearance had been as a shopkeeper named Mr. Willy, a similarly eccentric character. A visible early role is his appearance in Horse Feathers, the 1932 Marx Brothers comedy, in which he plays a radio play-by- play announcer at the film's climactic college football game. His film career began in silent pictures in 1914 and ran some 40 years. In the early 1950s he turned his attention primarily to television, appearing in various western series as well as Superman. Phil Tead starred in the episode \\"Old Bailey\\" of the western series, The Lone Ranger, in 1952 from Season 3, episode 49, where he played the title character Old Bailey along with John Hart and Jay Silverheels. In 1957 Tead appeared as Young on the TV western series Cheyenne in the episode titled \\"Land Beyond the Law.\\" In 1958-1958 Tead appeared in several episodes of the TV western series The Lawman.

They also killed the shepherd and took his wife as a captive. Expedition =Background and reason for attack= According to William Montgomery Watt, Uyaynah b. Hisn al-Fazari was annoyed because Muhammad had broken off negotiations with him over the withdrawal of Ghatafan. (free online) Abdur Rahman Uyanah bin Hisn Al-Fazari made a raid, looted the camels, and killed the man who looked after them and kidnapped his wife. Salamah ibn al-Akwa was the first to find this out, and he chased after him. Muhammad later found out and joined the chase. The place by which it was fought is known as Dhu Qarad, a reservoir of water at a day's journey from Madinah. According to the majority of scholars, this incident took place three days before the battle of Khaibar. =Muslim response= A hunt took place, and the camel and the kidnapped women were brought back. Muhammad on his way back to Medina stopped at a place called Dhu Qarad and sacrificed a camel. Muhammad collected 500-700 fighters, but followed up by sending 8 horsemen. Only 40 enemy horsemen were involved, and the booty Muslims captured was 20 milking camels. Half the camels were recovered, and while doing so, the Muslims killed 4 of the raiders while suffering the same loss of their own men.

Stems (axes) were smooth and leafless, up to 3.1 mm in diameter, and branched dichotomously or pseudomonopodially (i.e. one branch formed more of a 'main' stem than the other). Specimens show up to three orders of branching. The internal anatomy of the stems is unknown. Spore-forming organs or sporangia were borne laterally on at least the last two orders of branches, possibly more. Sporangia were flattened, more-or-less circular to kidney- shaped (reniform) in face view, and upright on stalks about 2.5 mm long. They were relatively large, typically up to about 4 mm high and 4 mm wide, although a few were significantly larger. To release its spores, a sporangium split into two 'valves' along a thickened margin at the top. Spores have not been observed. Associated with stems bearing sporangia were other stems with branches at wide angles, some with short side branches. They are thought to represent a system of basal rhizomes, but direct connections to the aerial stems were not observed. The gametophyte is unknown. Taxonomy The genus Wenshania was created by Zhu and Kenrick in 1998 with a single species, Wenshania zhichangensis. The fossil specimens were found in Zhichang village in the Wenshan district of southwestern China. The genus name is derived from the district, the specific epithet from the village. Although similar in some characteristics to the genus Zosterophyllum Penhallow (1892), that genus was described as having its sporangia in a \\"loose spike\\", whereas the specimens concerned have their sporangia distributed over more than one order of branching rather than in a terminal spike. Hence the authors considered that a new genus was required. Phylogeny Wenshania is clearly related to the broadly defined group of zosterophylls, as it had flattened, oval to reniform sporangia which were attached to the sides of stems on short stalks and which released spores by splitting into two valves along a thickened border. The genus was described later than the publication of the cladistic studies by Kenrick and Crane which have been the foundation for much of the phylogeny of early land plants. It falls outside the core clade of zosterophylls (Zosterophyllopsida sensu Kenrick & Crane), whose members have sporangia arranged in two rows and new growths with coiled tips. The authors of the genus say that Wenshania most closely resembles Gumuia found in the same stratum, whose current phylogenetic placement in a paraphyletic group basal to the core zosterophylls can be seen in the summary cladogram shown below. Hao and Xue in 2013 listed the genus as a zosterophyll.

Retrieved 27 March 2011 via Google Documents. Early life William was born in Cutting's Prairie, north of the Columbia River in the newly created Washington Territory, a vast area of wilderness which had been separated from the Oregon Territory by an Act of Congress in 1853. He was the first member of his family born in the United States. His father, James Urquhart, left Scotland in 1851, taking a ship to New York City, and traveling on foot to New Orleans and by boat up the Mississippi River to Iowa, before joining a wagon train and heading west on the Oregon Trail. William's mother and five older brothers and sisters reunited with James Urquhart in early 1855. They traveled around Cape Horn to San Francisco and then to the mouth of the Columbia River by ship, where they transferred to canoes for the last leg of their journey up the Cowlitz River. The trip took them over six months. William was born later that year in a house his father had built on land he had acquired through a Donation Claim. As the Urquhart family continued to grow in size, they added additional acreage to their holdings and tended to a variety of crops and animals for their own use and for the markets of Olympia on the Puget Sound.Prosser, William Farrand; A history of the Puget Sound country, The Lewis Publishing Company (1903), p. 425. Like his ten siblings who grew to maturity, William became skilled at all aspects of farm work on the frontier. Napavine When William Urquhart was eighteen, his father added to the family's real estate holdings when he purchased a large tract of land that included a small store and its merchandise. James Urquhart opened a general store (which he ran with his son, John). He laid out a town which he named Napavine. In addition to farm work, William began to clerk in the store learning the merchant's trade. In 1878 his older brother, John, moved six miles north to Chehalis where he opened a store of his own. John was also the Treasurer of Lewis County and involved in making Chehalis a main stop of the new railroad as well as the county seat. John's sudden and unexpected death changed the course of William's life. Chehalis When his older brother died, William Urquhart moved to Chehalis to take over the store. He was twenty-five years old. It was 1880 and Chehalis was just beginning a period of great growth. For the next fifty years he lived in Chehalis and was involved many aspects of the city's growth. When he arrived the buildings were mainly wood. In 1889 he greatly expanded his business and constructed a large brick building for his merchandise house. He joined a group of businessmen who formed the National Bank of Chehalis (later Coffman & Dobson) and built a large brick building to house it. He was part of the Chehalis Land and Timber Company which was responsible for much of the planning and growth during the ensuing years.Jones, Edward Gardner; The Oregonian's handbook of the Pacific Northwest, The Oregonian Publishing Company (1894), p. 315. For eight years he was the Treasurer of Lewis County; he served as Mayor of Chehalis and also as Councilman; and he was Postmaster for a number of years. Family In 1881 William Urquhart married Anna Manning whose pioneer parents had settled near Winlock, not far from Napavine. Anna's father, Joseph P. Manning, had crossed on the Oregon trail in 1848. His future wife,Caroline Aubert, was part of the same wagon train. William and Anna had four children who lived in very different circumstance than their pioneer parents.

His second son, William, became a lawyer and investment banker, traveling the world visiting the ancient seat of the Clan Urquhart at the Black Isle and enjoying the social seasons at Craigston Castle. His daughter, Helen, married a school teacher turned banker and raised her two sons in Chehalis. His second daughter, Louise, married a businessman and moved to the midwest. William Urquhart died at home in 1933. His wife, Anna, had died two years earlier. They are buried at Fernhill(Urquhart)Cemetery just a few miles from downtown Chehalis. William and Anna had donated the land for the cemetery and provided a fund for its upkeep.

Thus, solid-state NMR spectroscopy would be used primarily, possibly supplemented by quantum chemistry calculations (e.g. density functional theory), powder diffraction etc. If suitable crystals can be grown, any crystallographic method would generally be preferred to determine the crystal structure comprising in case of organic compounds the molecular structures and molecular packing. The main interest in NMR crystallography is in microcrystalline materials which are amenable to this method but not to X-ray, neutron and electron diffraction. This is largely because interactions of comparably short range are measured in NMR crystallography. Introduction When applied to organic molecules, NMR crystallography aims at including structural information not only of a single molecule but also on the molecular packing (i.e. crystal structure). Contrary to X-ray, single crystals are not necessary with solid-state NMR and structural information can be obtained from high-resolution spectra of disordered solids. E.g. polymorphism is an area of interest for NMR crystallography since this is encountered occasionally (and may often be previously undiscovered) in organic compounds. In this case a change in the molecular structure and/or in the molecular packing can lead to polymorphism, and this can be investigated by NMR crystallography. Dipolar couplings-based approach The spin interaction that is usually employed for structural analyses via solid state NMR spectroscopy is the magnetic dipolar interaction. Additional knowledge about other interactions within the studied system like the chemical shift or the electric quadrupole interaction can be helpful as well, and in some cases solely the chemical shift has been employed as e.g. for zeolites. The ‚Äúdipole coupling‚Äù-based approach parallels protein NMR spectroscopy to some extent in that e.g. multiple residual dipolar couplings are measured for proteins in solution, and these couplings are used as constraints in the protein structure calculation. In NMR crystallography the observed spins in case of organic molecules would often be spin-1/2 nuclei of moderate frequency (, , , etc.). I.e. is excluded due to its large magnetogyric ratio and high spin concentration leading to a network of strong homonuclear dipolar couplings. There are two solutions with respect to 1H: spin diffusion experiments (see below) and specific labelling with spins (spin = 1). The latter is also popular e.g. in NMR spectroscopic investigations of hydrogen bonds in solution and the solid state. Both intra- and intermolecular structural elements can be investigated e.g. via deuterium REDOR (an established solid state NMR pulse sequence to measure dipolar couplings between deuterons and other spins). This can provide an additional constraint for an NMR crystallographic structural investigation in that it can be used to find and characterize e.g. intermolecular hydrogen bonds. =Dipolar interaction= The above-mentioned dipolar interaction can be measured directly, e.g. between pairs of heteronuclear spins like 13C/15N in many organic compounds. Furthermore, the strength of the dipolar interaction modulates parameters like the longitudinal relaxation time or the spin diffusion rate which therefore can be examined to obtain structural information. E.g. 1H spin diffusion has been measured providing rich structural information. =Chemical shift interaction= The chemical shift interaction can be used in conjunction with the dipolar interaction to determine the orientation of the dipolar interaction frame (principal axes system) with respect to the molecular frame (dipolar chemical shift spectroscopy). For some cases there are rules for the chemical shift interaction tensor orientation as for the 13C spin in ketones due to symmetry arguments (sp2 hybridisation). If the orientation of a dipolar interaction (between the spin of interest and e.g. another heteronucleus) is measured with respect to the chemical shift interaction coordinate system, these two pieces of information (chemical shift tensor/molecular orientation and the dipole tensor/chemical shift tensor orientation) combined give the orientation of the dipole tensor in the molecular frame. However, this method is only suitable for small molecules (or polymers with a small repetition unit like polyglycine) and it provides only selective (and usually intramolecular) structural information. Crystal Structure Refinements The dipolar interaction yields the most direct information with respect to structure as it makes it possible to measure the distances between the spins. The sensitivity of this interaction is however lacking and even though dipolar-based NMR crystallography makes the elucidation of structures possible, other methods are necessary to obtain high resolution structures. For these reasons much work was done to include the use other NMR observables such as chemical shift anisotropy, J-coupling and the quadrupolar interaction. These anisotropic interactions are highly sensitive to the 3D local environment making it possible to refine the structures of powdered samples to structures rivaling the quality of single crystal X-ray diffraction. These however rely on adequate methods for predicting these interactions as they do not depend in a straightforward fashion on the structure. Comparison with diffraction methods A drawback of NMR crystallography is that the method is typically more time consuming and more expensive (due to spectrometer costs and isotope labelling) than X-ray crystallography, it often elucidates only part of the structure, and isotope labelling and experiments may have to be tailored to obtain key structural information. Also not always is a molecular structure suitable for a pure NMR-based NMR crystallographic approach, but it can still play an important role in a multimodality (NMR+diffraction) study. Unlike in the case of diffraction methods, it appears that NMR crystallography needs to work on a case by case basis. This is the case since difference systems will have different spin physics and different observables which can be probed. The method may therefore not find widespread use as different systems will require qualified individuals to design experiments to study them.

History Established in 1866, Belgravia featured serialized novels, poems, travel narratives, and biographies, as well as essays on fashion, history, and science. Under the editorship of Braddon (1866‚Äì1876), the magazine was best known for publishing sensation fiction. In 1876, Chatto & Windus purchased the magazine and Andrew Chatto replaced Braddon as editor. Under Chatto, Belgravia moved away from sensation fiction and began publishing works by such authors as Charles Reade, Mark Twain, Wilkie Collins, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Thomas Hardy. Belgravia's circulation peaked at 18,000 in 1868, and was at 15,000 when it was sold to Chatto & Windus. As it dropped its focus on sensation literature, sales of the magazine plummeted, and by 1877 its circulation was down to 3,000. The magazine was issued monthly, and often an \\"annual\\" issue would be issued near the end of the year. The magazine published a total of 406 issues, with the first edition being published in November 1866 and the last edition being published in June 1899.

The complex of fourteen buildings is divided in two by Olympic Hotsprings Road. To the east lie the ranger station and three residences, with nine maintenance buildings on the west side of the road. The complex was turned over to the National Park Service in 1940 when the land was added to Olympic National Park from Olympic National Forest. Construction is typical of USFS practice, and reflects the Forest Service's preference of the time for bungalow and American Craftsman style architecture. and The Elwha area was designated as one of fifteen areas in Olympic National Forest to be used for public recreation. The \\"Cleator Plan,\\" named after Forest Service recreation engineer Fred W. Cleator, envisioned the construction of appropriate structures to support these activities, including a ranger station. In the mid-1930s a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was established nearby, contributing labor for forest construction projects. When the area was taken over by the National Park Service in 1940 the complex continued in use virtually unchanged, retaining its Forest Service character. Buildings The historic district comprises 13 contributing buildings, built between 1930 and 1936. The Elwha Ranger Station Office () was built in 1932. The one-story wood frame structure is covered with half-log siding on the lower walls in two widths and shingles on the gables. The building is irregular in shape, with porches on the south and west sides, supported by log columns. The Ranger Station Residence () was also built in 1932. The 1-1/2 story frame structure is similar in construction and materials, located a little distance away from the office. The Mechanic's House () had previously been built in 1930. This 1-1/2 story building is similar to the others. A matching woodshed is nearby (). The Bunkhouse () was built in 1932, measuring by . The 1-1/2 story structure is of similar construction to the others, with its own woodshed (). The maintenance area across the road includes the 1930 fire cache building (), equipment shed (), equipment repair shop () and horse barn (), all of wood frame construction. The two-story barn is covered with board-and-batten siding and has a distinctive Forest Service character. 1936 buildings include the gas and oil building (), constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps, an equipment shed () that was moved in 1948 from the Elwha CCC camp, and a smaller lean-to shed (). The oil and grease building has a residential character, with stylized pine tree cut-outs in the gables and curved support brackets on the front porch. The equipment sheds are large gabled 1-1/2 story buildings with exposed rafter tails and prominent gable dormers.

In later life, Halliday was involved in property management in Cleveland, Ohio. Early life Halliday was born on April 28, 1883 He was the son of Samuel D. Halliday an Ithaca, New York lawyer who graduated from Cornell in 1870. The younger Halliday attended public schools through high school in Ithaca. College Halliday attended college at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York where he graduated in 1906 with a law degree. While at Cornell he lettered in football under coach Bill Warner in 1903, and Bill's brother Pop Warner in 1904 and 1905. During his career he was one of the first football player to wear a helmet to protect his head during the game. The 1903 team won the first six games before losing three of the last four games and finishing with a 6-3-1 record. During the 1903 season Halliday had to sit out several weeks due to injury. He helped the Big Red to a 7-3 record in 1904 and a 6-4 in 1905. Halliday's leadership led him to be selected as president of the Quill and Dagger society. 1904 Cornell varsity football team: Halliday is the third from the left. Coaching career After graduating from Cornell, Halliway became head football coach at Hamilton College for the 1906 season. That season, he completed a 1-5-2 record. The following year, while practicing law in Ithaca, he became an assistant coach at Cornell under Henry Schoellkopf. This assistant coach position was part of a new system implemented by the university's Athletic Council to run the football program after Pop Warner left. The council created a \\"field committee\\" of three people to be charge of coaching the 1907 season. The committee was set up to consist of the captain of the team and two former players who have earned a varsity football letter. Halliday along with head coach Henry Schoellkopf were named as the former players while George Tandy Cook was named as the captain. The team finished with a record of 8-2 including a victory over national power Princeton and losses to Penn and Penn State. =Head coaching record= Political career A Republican, Halliway was elected District Attorney of Tompkins County in 1909, and was re-elected in 1912.

Mendocino beginnings 1910 signatures: phoneticized Look Tin Eli in Cantonese 1918 signatures: used Chinese name Èô∏ÊΩ§Âçø Born May 5, 1870, in the back of the store operated by his father on the south side of Mendocino's Main Street, Look Tin Eli was the firstborn in Mendocino's Look family (Èô∏ L√π, also Luk or Loke in Cantonese). The Look family was headed by his Chinese immigrant father from Heung-san (È¶ôÂ±±), Luk Bing-Tai (aka Eli Tia Key), and his mother, Su Wang, who had four children. As a boy, he was sent to China in 1879, prior to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, to learn the Chinese language and culture. Upon his return to San Francisco in 1884, he was denied entry at age 14 back to the United States because he lacked the necessary certificate under the 1882 Act. He challenged the decision at the federal level and won his case at the U.S. Circuit Court of San Francisco. This was the celebrated case of Look Tin Sing, which was Look Tin Eli's childhood name. In court, he was represented by two lawyers; one was Thomas Riordan, a prominent San Francisco attorney retained by the Chinese consulate and perhaps the Chinese Six Companies. The 1884 ruling by Justice Stephen Field, who declared that children born in U.S. jurisdictions are U.S. citizens regardless of ancestry, was an important decision that preceded the landmark 1898 U.S. Supreme Court citizenship case. After completing his education, he took over the management of what was his father's store, which had been sold in 1881. Reportedly, he and his younger brother, Lee Eli, \\"capably ran the Mendocino store in the 1890s\\". As a merchant, he visited China twice, returning to the U.S. in July 1891 and November 1895. San Francisco career In the 1890s, Look Tin Eli, with his China-born wife (surname Jeong) and two children, moved to San Francisco. In February 1904, Tin Eli, with his younger brother, Lee Eli, as his assistant, helped establish a San Francisco branch of the Russo-Chinese Bank at 417 Montgomery Street, the only branch in the United States. He was the \\"confidential adviser to the bank\\" and managed the Chinese negotiations and loans, abroad and locally. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire destroyed Chinatown, including the Russo-Chinese Bank, Look Tin Eli became \\"the public face of the post-quake rebuilding of Chinatown\\". As general manager of the Sing Chong bazaar, he articulated a vision of post-quake Chinatown as an \\"ideal Oriental City\\". Already a skilled negotiator, he secured substantial loans from his Hong Kong and Canton partners for the rebuilding and persuaded Chinese merchants to hire western architects to rebuild Chinatown in an \\"Oriental\\" style in order to promote tourism and social change. In this way, his grand vision of \\"veritable fairy palaces filled with the choicest treasures of the Orient\\" was realized by the design (by T. Paterson Ross) and construction of the pagoda-topped buildings of the Sing Chong and Sing Fat bazaars on the west corners of Grant Ave (then Dupont St) and California St, which have since become icons of San Francisco Chinatown. In 1907, Tin Eli also helped found and operate, in partnership with cannery magnate Lew Hing, the Canton Bank of San Francisco (ÈáëÂ±±Âª£Êù±ÈäÄË°å), the first Chinese-owned bank in the United States. On the corner of Kearny and Clay, it was for a time the only bank to provide the Chinese community with financial resources to rebuild Chinatown. A year later, Canton Bank of San Francisco was the principal bank for more than 100,000 Chinese in the United States and Mexico. The largest individual stockholder was Mendocino's Look Poong-San., who has been identified as his uncle or, more often, as his brother.. His brother, Lee Eli, was also a wealthy banker. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Look Tin Eli was able in 1908 to persuade the chief of police to allow fireworks permit for Chinese New Year festivities, gaining support from the white merchants as well. The reconstruction of the post-quake Chinatown was thus completed in 1908, a year ahead of the rest of the City of San Francisco. In 1910, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce sent him, along with Ng Poon Chew from the Chinese Six Companies, to Washington DC to object, after the fact and to no avail, to the relocation of the immigration station from the shed on pier 40 in San Francisco to Angel Island. In October 1914, as president of the Canton Bank, he hosted 300 guests in a grand \\"red egg feast\\", expanding the custom traditionally reserved for male babies, to celebrate the one-month birthday of his new granddaughter, with the governor of the Federal Reserve Bank among those bringing congratulations. In 1915, in response to Pacific Mail Steamship Company withdrawing service to the Orient, a group of Chinese-American businessmen organized the China Mail Steamship Company (‰∏≠ÂúãÈÉµËàπÂÖ¨Âè∏), the first Chinese-owned steamship company in the United States, and elected Look Tin Eli as its founding president.

The NSFNET Backbone Service and ANS CO+RE both used and shared the common ANSNet infrastructure. NSF agreed to allow ANS CO+RE to carry commercial traffic subject to several conditions:Review of NSFNET, Office of the Inspector General, National Science Foundation, 23 March 1993 * that the NSFNET Backbone Service was not diminished; * that ANS CO+RE recovered at least the average cost of the commercial traffic traversing the network; and * that any excess revenues recovered above the cost of carrying the commercial traffic would be placed into an infrastructure pool to be distributed by an allocation committee broadly representative of the networking community to enhance and extend national and regional networking infrastructure and support. In 1992, ANS worked to address security concerns by potential customers caused by recent security incidents (e.g. morris worm) and opened an office in Northern Virginia for their security product team. The security team created one of the first Internet firewalls called ANS InterLock. The InterLock was arguably the first proxy-based Internet firewall product (other firewalls at the time were router-based ACLs or part of a service offering). The InterLock was modifications to IBM's AIX and later Sun's Solaris operating system. InterLock's popularity at the time of the boom of the WWW was responsible for the infamous proxy settings in the Mosaic browser, so users could access the Internet transparently thru their L7 inspection proxy for HTTP 1.0.

The project is managed by Anesrif. Route The route runs 1200 km from Tebessa in the east to Moulay Slissen in the west, via Tiaret and M'Sila, through a sparsely populated area bordering the Atlas mountains and the Sahara; 18 new passenger stations are planned. This route incorporates some elements of the existing network, connected by 630 km of new lines. Most of Algeria's existing rail network is further north, along the coast; the \\"inland\\" route allows traffic to bypass the main \\"Rocade Nord\\" route through Constantine, Algiers, and Oran. This project goes hand in hand with Anesrif's other plans to improve Algeria's 4000 km of existing railways. A further stretch of railway will run from Tlemcen to a new station at Maghina and then to the Moroccan border at Akid Abbas. The border with Morocco has been sealed since 1994, but there is pressure to reopen the border to travellers. Specification The route is mostly being built for running; the line near the Moroccan border is designed for higher speeds. The line is standard gauge (even though it crosses some existing gauge lines) and mostly single-track. There is provision for 25 kV electrification in the future. GSM-R will be used for communications. Project The project is being managed by Anesrif, an Algerian state agency which is undertaking several large projects to revitalise railways and build new infrastructure. Anesrif has awarded contracts to various consortia. Once in operation, new lines will be operated by SNTF. *In May 2010, a contract was awarded to build a 185 km section of railway from Tissemsilt-Tiaret-Relizane, for 160 km/h running; it will be designed with future electrification in mind. *In March 2011, Anesrif awarded a contract to build the railway from Tlemcen to the Moroccan border. *As of March 2011, Alstom was already constructing the 120 km section between Saida and Moulay Slissen. *Work was expected to begin on the 153 km Saida-Tiaret line in the summer of 2011. Development The east-west High Plateau line incorporates some elements of existing Algerian lines, although away from the coast, existing infrastructure has mostly been north-south. *The Tebessa- Annaba line largely operates independently, hauling iron ore and phosphates to a port on the coast; there have been proposals to spin it off as a private concession. *There was already a line from Ain M'lilla to Barika, part of an oil export chain from Touggourt, developed by France during the colonial era. As existing railways in Algeria are poorly utilised, despite expensive investments in the past, there have been concerns about the authorities' ability to manage capacity appropriately. Away from the coast, Algeria is sparsely populated, although cities are expected to grow as a result of improved infrastructure; this has already happened in Tiaret.

Saint Walker is an alien member of the galactic Blue Lantern Corps, an organization dedicated to spreading peace and harmony through the power of hope throughout the universe. Publication history Saint Walker first appeared in Green Lantern Vol. 4 #25 and was created by Geoff Johns and Ethan Van Sciver. Character history Walker was a priest on his home planet of Astonia (with a wife and two children), which was doomed, as its ancient sun was dying. Saint Walker manages to calm his despairing people and give them hope in the face of extinction, which causes a Blue Lantern ring to choose him as a member of the Blue Lantern Corps, stating that he \\"has the ability to instill great hope\\". With his ring, he sets his sun's age back 8.9 billion years, thereby saving his home planet.Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps #1 (July 2009) Saint Walker and his fellow Blue Lanterns are first introduced in the midst of the Final Crisis event as part of the build-up to the Blackest Night storyline. During the Final Crisis, Hal Jordan and John Stewart of the Green Lantern Corps have just been ambushed by the Red Lantern Corps, who take the rogue former Green Lantern Sinestro from their custody. After Jordan is injured during the conflict, his wounds are healed when he first comes into contact with Saint Walker.Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns #1 (October 2008) In the Blackest Night storyline, having joined Hal Jordan's and Indigo-1's efforts to rally one member of each Corps to attempt to destroy the Black Lantern power battery, Saint Walker agrees to use his power ring to ease Larfleeze's hunger while they work together. When deputizing an Earth hero to assist in the current crisis until the rest of the Blue Lantern Corps can arrive, Walker's ring selects Barry Allen as a temporary Blue Lantern. After Nekron is defeated, Walker works with Carol Ferris to heal Mera of the influence of her red power ring. In Justice League of America #55 (2011), the character joins the titular team in battling Eclipso, and attempts to assist the resurrected Hank Henshaw against Doomsday on Batman's orders.Renaud, Jeffrey. \\"REIGN OF THE DOOMSAYERS: James Robinson\\", Comic Book Resources, March 23, 2011 In the War of the Green Lanterns storyline, Saint Walker and the rest of the New Guardians make their way to the planet Ryut. Krona and the Emotional Entities are nowhere to be found but the group does come upon the Book of the Black.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #63 (March 2011) When former Sinestro Corps member Lyssa Drak appears, she quickly subdues the New Guardians, trapping all but Hal in the Book of the Black.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #64 (March 2011) Hal escapes with the rings of the New Guardians, later passing Walker's ring on to Kyle Rayner when Krona infects the Central Power Battery with Parallax to bring the Green Lantern Corps under his influence.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #65 (April 2011) In the final battle Saint Walker is freed from the book by Kyle, his blue ring returns to him and the Guardians of the Universe then teleport him back to Odym.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #67 (July 2011) Afterwards, Saint Walker returns to Oa to restore Ganthet's missing hand.War of the Green Lanterns: Aftermath #1 (July 2011) =The New 52= In the new series Green Lantern: New Guardians, Saint Walker assisted Kyle Rayner when he became a \\"magnet\\" for other power rings, helping Kyle escape the attacks of the other four Corps members who had tracked the rings. They travel to Oa to try to seek the aid of the Guardians.Green Lantern: New Guardians #2 (October 2011) Unfortunately, this plan backfires when it is revealed that Ganthet has been stripped of his emotions by the other Guardians, to the extent that he attacks Walker when Walker tries to help Kyle directly after he is briefly overwhelmed by the rings. Ganthet proclaims that the Blue Lantern Corps were a mistake that he will now rectify.Green Lantern: New Guardians #3 (November 2011) After they are forced to escape the Guardians, Walker heals Arkillo's severed tongue using an illusion of Sinestro.Green Lantern: New Guardians #4 (December 2011) However, in the subsequent confrontation with Archangel Invictus, Walker is unable to heal Invictus' anger at the Lanterns, although his actions do help Invictus see that the Lanterns are not completely tainted.Green Lantern: New Guardians #6 (February 2012) Returning to Odym to regroup after Invictus releases the New Guardians only if they agree to kill Larfleeze, Walker learns that Odym is being attacked by the Reach, enemies of all ring-wielders, forcing him to call the other New Guardians for help when he attempts to teach the other Blue Lanterns how to channel their auras to increase their offensive capabilities so that they can fight on their own.Green Lantern: New Guardians #9 (May 2012) Although he and the other New Guardians aid Kyle against Invictus, the team splits up after learning that Sayd was responsible for drawing the rings to Kyle as part of a plan to assemble a team to save Ganthet, feeling that her actions have tainted the team before it began, regardless of her motives in bringing them together.Green Lantern: New Guardians #12 (August 2012) Following the defeat of the Third Army and the fall of the Guardians, the Blue Lantern Corps relocated to the planet Elpis,Green Lantern Corps #20 (June 2013) but were soon attacked by the cosmic entity known as Relic, who sought to rid the universe of its ostensible \\"lightsmiths\\", as he considers it the only way to keep the universe safe. The rest of the Blue Lantern Corps were destroyed, leaving only Walker as he was taken to safety by Kyle Rayner, Carol Ferris and the Templar Guardians while Elpis was devastated by Relic's assault.Green Lantern: New Guardians #23 Although Walker eventually recovered on Mogo, after learning of Relic's revelations that there was only a limited amount of power in the emotional reservoir that powered the rings and the destruction of the other Blue Lanterns, Walker's depression caused his ring to abandon him, Walker accepting that it was probably for the best as the power of the blue rings could drain the reservoir further.Green Lantern #27 However, he later regained his hope, and his ring, after witnessing Kyle Rayner's White Lantern abilities on New Genesis, confident that the emotional reservoir could be refilled in the future.Green Lantern: New Guardians #40 =DC Rebirth= In the DC Rebirth title Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps, Saint Walker appears on an unknown planet, and is engaged in battle with hostile aliens when Hal Jordan and Kyle Rayner arrive.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #14 (February 2017) After they destroy the hostile aliens, Hal and Kyle ask Saint Walker to join them in meeting with Ganthet and Sayd.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #15 (February 2017) Saint Walker arrives at the new base of the Green Lantern Corps on Mogo, and is reunited with the sentient planet.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #16 (March 2017) Later, Ganthet and Sayd test Saint Walker, attempting to form a psionic link with Kyle's White Lantern power, as they believe that this could bring about the resurrection of the Blue Lantern Corps. However, they are prevented from doing so, though Saint Walker experiences visions of an unknown presence.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #17 (March 2017) Powers and abilities Saint Walker possesses a blue power ring which is fueled by the emotion hope. While hope is the most powerful of the seven emotions, he must be near an active Green Lantern's power ring to tap into his own ring's full power. Otherwise, the rings are only capable of the default abilities of flight and a protective aura. This is due to the fact that the power of hope is nothing without the willpower to act on it. Blue rings must be fueled by true hope in order to operate at their users' command. While under the influence of a nearby green power ring, Saint Walker can heal wounds. The ring's power can be supplemented with the hope of other living beings; for instance, Saint Walker and Warth were able to reduce a dying sun's age by 8.6 billion years because of the hope emanating from the inhabitants of a nearby planet. A blue ring can negatively impact the performance of rings on the opposite side of the emotional spectrum. During his initial meeting with the JLA, Saint Walker discovered that his abilities can also be augmented by proximity to Starman (Mikaal Tomas). As the first and most experienced Blue Lantern, Walker has shown the ability to channel his aura to increase his strength and hold his own in a fight against many adversaries. In other media =Television= * Saint Walker appears in the Green Lantern: The Animated Series episode \\"Lost Planet\\", voiced by Phil Morris.Interview with Justice League: Doom Actor Phil Morris In the episode, Saint Walker is introduced as a hermit who lives on Mogo, a sentient planet that traps evildoers. He encounters Razer, a former member of the Red Lantern Corps, and tries to convince the youth to turn away from the path of violence he currently walks. Despite his peaceful demeanor, Walker is portrayed as a very agile and adept fighter, capable of disarming Razer in hand-to-hand combat without the use of a power ring. Although in possession of a green power ring, he declines joining the Corps, believing that his own destiny lies elsewhere. During \\"Invasion\\" Saint Walker talks to Mogo about what his role is in the Red Lantern invasion (as Mogo saved him and told him there is a beacon of hope that can stop the Red Lanterns) so Mogo tells him that he must climb to the highest peak of the sentient planet. As he climbs, he witnesses Atrocitus recruit one of the prisoners Mogo kept on his surface. Saint Walker wanted to exact revenge on them after they destroyed his homeworld but Mogo insisted that they were not important at that time. Once he reached the peak, he asked Mogo where the beacon was and while he thought that the empty peak was a message that there was no hope, he refused to believe that, that was the case. After Saint Walker vows to stop the Red Lantern Corps, and set the world to right,Hal Jordan's Green Lantern power battery (now a Blue Lantern power battery thanks to Ganthet) presents Saint Walker with a Blue Power Ring and the role of being both the leader of the Blue lantern Corps and the universe's last hope. In the season finale, Saint Walker (now a Blue Lantern), along with Mogo, aid Kilowog in the final stand against the Red Lantern fleet of ships. Saint Walker has also appeared in the second season of the animated series, in an episode that takes place on Odym, alongside Ganthet and the second Blue Lantern, Brother Warth. Hal Jordan and Kilowog travel to Odym with a damaged Manhunter to contact Ganthet, the only Guardian that Hal Jordan trusts, in order to learn more about the Manhunter robots. They discover that Red Lantern Razer has been living on Odym, trying to bring his rage under control. Ganthet explains the origin of the Manhunters, but his priority is in igniting the Blue Lantern Power Battery. Unfortunately, doing so not only reactivates the damaged Manhunter, but as the power of the Blue Lantern battery sweeps across space, it attracts other Manhunters to Odym. Although the combined forces of Jordan, Kilowog, Saint Walker, Warth, and Razer are able to defeat the Manhunters, Ganthet determines that the Blue Lantern battery must be shut down until the Manhunters have been dealt with permanently. * A mental institution called St. Walker's Hospital is mentioned in the Arrow second-season episode entitled \\"Blast Radius\\". St. Walker's is a mental institution in which Brother Blood's mother resides. Laurel Lance becomes suspicious of Blood and tracks the woman down to the institute with the idea that it's Blood's aunt, but finds out that she is in fact Blood's mother.

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1960 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as WPB-82313 when commissioned and acquired the name Point Slocum in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .Coast Guard Historian websiteScheina, p 72 Construction and design details Point Slocum was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.Scheina, p 71 She was powered by two VT600 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full.Scheina, p 71 Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360-degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Slocum included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.Scheina, p 72Scotti, p 10Scotti, p 219 History After delivery in 1961, Point Slocum was assigned a homeport of St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. At the request of the United States Navy, in October 1965, she was alerted for service in South Vietnam and assigned to Coast Guard Squadron One in support of Operation Market Time along with 8 other Point class cutters.Larzelere, p 72Cutler, p 84 While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, Point Slocum was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to Subic Bay, Philippines arriving in January 1966 where she was refitted for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single- sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of 4 M2 machine guns. The original Oerlikon 20 mm cannon was replaced with a combination over- under .50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger-fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam.Larzelere, p 21Cutler, p 82 For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.Larzelere, p 15 Point Slocum was assigned to Division 13 of Squadron One to be based at Cat Lo Naval Base near Vung Tau, along with , , , , , , and .

While working toward a Bachelor of Arts degree at the California Institute of Technology, he excelled at science, math, and engineering, and decided to apply those skills to his love of music. According to Ryan, in 1977 he and two fellow Caltech students Alan Danziger and Don Lieberman were looking at some of E-mu Systems products selling for about $400, and thought that, considering the wholesale cost of the electronic parts involved was about $15, they could produce a similar product and sell it for half the price. What the students ended up designing instead was one of the first digital synthesizers, the 800-chip Con Brio, Inc. Advanced Digital Synthesizer (ADS), which utilized three 6502 processors, the same processor used in the Apple II computer and Commodore 64. The ADS offered an advanced feature set for its time: 64 oscillators which could be both amplitude- and frequency- modulated, split keyboard capability, 16-stage envelopes, layering and modulation, and multiple digital-to-analog converters. The resulting unit cost $30,000, but there was very little market for this kind of synthesizer. Con Brio produced three different examples of the ADS, but only sold one, which was used on some major studio film scores and then owned by Chick Corea.

Halvar is a strong and big warrior who measures the strength of people through muscles. Vicky, on the other hand, is a small but very smart boy who always has to prove his father that the ingenuity of a man can meet muscles. One day the village of Flake falls under attack, and all the children ‚Äì including Vicky‚Äôs girlfriend Ylvi (Mercedes Jadea Diaz) ‚Äì are kidnapped except for Vicky himself, so Vicky, his father Halvar and the other Vikings of the village decide to go out and try to rescue them. The kidnappers turn out to be Sven the Terrible and his band of Viking pirates, who are hunting for a legendary treasure, and in order to gain it, they need the assistance of a child who has never spoken a lie in his or her life. Whilst in pursuit, the Flake Vikings pick up a young Chinese girl and an obnoxious bard (Michael Herbig) for company, and together they succeed in rescuing the children, outsmarting Sven and escaping back to Flake with the treasure (though it is not as bountiful as they might have imagined). Sequel Due to the film's tremendous success in Germany, a sequel titled Wickie auf gro√üer Fahrt has been made which is slated to make its cinematic debut in Germany on September 29, 2011. The film will be presented in 3D and will include the original cast with the exception of Michael Herbig; it was directed by Christian Ditter.Wickie II to Come in 3D, But Without Bully.

These resolutions imposed sanctions on key members of the Gaddafi government and authorized NATO to implement an arms embargo, a no-fly zone and to use all means necessary, short of foreign occupation, to protect Libyan civilians and civilian populated areas. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 The operation started on 23 March 2011 and gradually expanded during the following weeks, by integrating more and more elements of the multinational military intervention, which had started on 19 March in response to the same UN resolutions. As of 31 March 2011 it encompassed all international operations in Libya. NATO support was vital to the rebel victory over the forces loyal to Gaddafi. The operation officially ended on 31 October 2011, after the rebel leaders, formalized in the National Transitional Council, had declared Libya liberated on 23 October. The operation began with a naval arms embargo, while command of the no-fly zone and the air strikes against Libyan Armed Forces remained under command of the international coalition, led by France, the United Kingdom and the United States, due to lack of consensus between NATO members. NATO arms embargo fact sheet On 24 March NATO decided to take control of the no-fly zone enforcement, by integrating the air assets of the international coalition under NATO command, although the command of air strikes on ground targets remained under national authority. NATO no fly zone fact sheet A few days later, on 27 March NATO decided to implement all military aspects of the UN resolution and formal transfer of command occurred at 06:00 GMT on 31 March 2011, formally ending the national operations such as the U.S.-coordinated Operation Odyssey Dawn. NATO protection of civilians fact sheet The arms embargo was initially carried out using mainly ships from NATO's Standing Maritime Group 1 and Standing Mine Countermeasures Group 1 already patrolling the Mediterranean Sea at the time of the resolution, enforced with additional ships, submarines and maritime surveillance aircraft from NATO members. They were to \\"monitor, report and, if needed, interdict vessels suspected of carrying illegal arms or mercenaries\\". The no-fly zone was enforced by aircraft transferred to Unified Protector from the international coalition, with additional aircraft from NATO and other allied nations. The air strikes, although under central NATO command, were only conducted by aircraft of the nations agreeing to enforce this part of the UN resolution.  Background  = Libyan conflict = With Operation Unified Protector, NATO is involved in an internal Libyan conflict, between those seeking to depose the country's long-time national leader Muammar Gaddafi and pro-Gaddafi forces. The conflict began as a series of non-peaceful disorders, part of the broader Arab Spring movement, which Gaddafi's security services attempted to repress, but which soon developed into a widespread uprising. The situation further escalated into armed conflict, with rebels establishing a provisional government named the National Transitional Council based in eastern city of Benghazi and controlling the eastern part of the country and the western city of Misrata. The International Criminal Court warned Gaddafi that he and members of his government may have committed crimes against humanity. The United Nations Security Council passed an initial resolution 1970, freezing the assets of Gaddafi and ten members of his inner circle, and restricting their travel. The resolution also referred the actions of the government to the International Criminal Court for investigation. In early March, Gaddafi's forces rallied, pushed eastwards and re-took several coastal cities and finally began attacking the rebel stronghold of Benghazi on 19 March 2011. Two days earlier a second U.N. resolution, UNSC Resolution 1973, was passed which authorized member states to establish and enforce an arms embargo, a no-fly zone over Libya and to use all means necessary, short of foreign occupation, to protect Libyan civilians. In response to the resolution, the Gaddafi government announced a ceasefire, but failed to uphold it and continued to advance on the rebels and the Second Battle of Benghazi began. = International intervention = In response to the U.N. resolution, voted on 17 March 2011, an international coalition was established and naval and air forces were quickly deployed in and around the Mediterranean Sea. Two days later, on 19 March, France intervened in the imminent Second Battle of Benghazi with air strikes on Gaddafi armor and troops and eventually forced them back. On the same day 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched from UK and US ships, further air strikes against ground targets were executed and a naval blockade was established. The initial coalition consisted of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Qatar, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. The official names for the interventions by the coalition members are Op√©ration Harmattan by France; Operation Ellamy by the United Kingdom; Operation Mobile for the Canadian participation and Operation Odyssey Dawn for the United States. The U.S. initially coordinated the effort and took strategic and tactical command at UCC USAFRICOM, led by Carter Ham, and the Joint Task Force Odyssey Dawn, led by Samuel J. Locklear aboard the command ship , respectively. From there on command was split between the air and naval components of the operation at which level the different participating countries commanded their assets in accordance with their rules of engagement and through liaison officers. After the initial intervention, the U.S. wanted to scale down their involvement significantly to a supporting role. Due to lack of consensus within NATO, the only other body capable of commanding a multinational operation of this size, however, this was not possible immediately. As consensus grew during the next days, NATO took more and more parts of the operation under its command until taking command of all military operations on 31 March.  Command structure  Political direction is provided by the North Atlantic Council to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. The chain of command is from Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Admiral James G. Stavridis (US Navy), to the Deputy Commander of Allied Joint Force Command Naples, Lt. General Charles Bouchard (Royal Canadian Air Force) acting as operational commander. From the operational level, command is further delegated to the Commander of Allied Maritime Command Naples, Vice Admiral Rinaldo Veri (Italian Navy) for the naval operations and Commander of Allied Air Command Izmir, Lieutenant General Ralph J. Jodice II (US Air Force) for air operations.http://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/pdf_2011_03/20110325_110325-unified- protector-command-control.pdf  Deployed forces  = Allied Maritime Command = * Belgian Naval Component  Narcis, a (Operational from 23 March 2011 until 24 July 2011)  Lobelia, a (Operational from 12 August 2011) * Bulgarian Navy  , a * Canadian Forces  Royal Canadian Navy * , a (transferred from Operation MOBILE, operational until 18 August 2011) * , a (operational from 18 August 2011) * 1 √ó CH-124 Sea King anti-submarine helicopter * French Navy (transferred from Op√©ration Harmattan)  Landing helicopter dock Tonnerre (L9014) * 14 √ó A√©rospatiale Gazelle * 4 √ó Eurocopter Tiger * 2 √ó Eurocopter Puma  2 √ó Atlantique 2 signals intelligence aircraft based at Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily, Italy  Task Force 473 * Aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle (R91)  10 √ó Rafale M fighters  6 √ó Super-Etendard strike aircraft  2 √ó E-2C airborne early warning aircraft  2 √ó Dauphin multipurpose helicopters  2 √ó Alouette III utility helicopters  French Air Force detachment of a Puma and 2 √ó Caracal transport helicopters * Anti-air frigate Jean Bart (D615) (until 2 April 2011) * Frigate Dupleix (D641) * Frigate Aconit (F713) * Frigate Chevalier Paul (D621) * Frigate Georges Leygues (D640) * Frigate Courbet (F712) (Returned to France) * Replenishment tanker Meuse (A607) * Nuclear attack submarine Am√©thyste (S605) * Hellenic Navy  , an * Italian Navy  Giuseppe Garibaldi aircraft carrier * 8 √ó AV-8B Harrier II V/STOL ground- attack aircraft * 4 √ó AW101 Merlin anti-submarine warfare helicopters * Boarding teams from the San Marco Regiment  Andrea Doria, a  Libeccio, a  Etna, an Etna-class auxiliary ship  Comandante Borsini and Comandante Bettica, two Comandanti-class patrol vessels * Royal Netherlands Navy  HNLMS Haarlem, an Alkmaar-class minehunter until 23 September  HNLMS Vlaardingen, an Alkmaar-class minehunter * Romanian Navy  'Regele Ferdinand', a Type 22 frigatehttp://www.mapn.ro/evenimente/uploads/documents/20110323_184038_2bc32864bab4abf9cb73729c2e1b777f.doc * Spanish Armed Forces  Spanish Navy * , an * Tramontana, an * Turkish Navy  TCG Giresun, a G-class frigate  TCG Gemlik, a G-class frigate  TCG Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m, a  TCG Yƒ±ldƒ±ray, a Type 209 submarine  TCG Akar, a fleet support ship * Royal Navy  ()HMS Bangor.

History The school was established in 1985 through the leadership of the former Municipal Mayor Nemesio Roxas. The school started with 90 first year students with only 5 teachers through the approval of a temporary permit #73. Soon, the exceedingly large number of enrollees in the next school year, 1986‚Äì87 paved the way for the hiring of more teachers and non-teaching personnel. Initially, Dr. Crisanto Rivera acted as the Officer- In-Charge. Upon his exit in 1986, Mrs. Leticia A. Bautista took office for two consecutive years until 1988. San Mateo Municipal High School was converted to a National High School under the management of Ms. Juana M. Garrovillas who served as the principal from 1988‚Äì2000. Apparently within her term, she was able to transpire physical improvements of the school facilities to meet the demands of the growing population. Makeshifts and 2 Ynares buildings were constructed through her consistent follow up at the municipal and provincial offices. Until then, Computer Room, Science Building, H.E. Room and Library were made possible for quality service. The first annex was established in 1994 pursuant to R.A. # 6655 addressing the growing need of the barangay for a public school in Barangay Silangan, San Mateo, Rizal. The annex started with one section of first year. When the AFP Retirement and Separation Benefit System granted the deed of donation on March 22, 1997, providing their own school site, Silangan Annex was separated from the main. It was therefore renamed, Silangan National High School under the leadership of Mr. Remigio Olesco as the former Teacher-In-Charge and presently managed by Mr. Ricardo C. Vergara, Principal I. Later, another annex was founded, the Sto. Ni√±o Annex which was headed by Mrs. Carmelita G. Olesco followed by Mrs. Flora V. Caron as TIC's, to address the growing population of Barangay Sto. Ni√±o. In 2006, this annex was declared as an Independent School, presently known as Sto. Ni√±o National High School. Last January 2014, Dr. Vidal F. Mendoza Ph. D. was replaced by Ms. Juana M. Garrovillas Principal IV of Francisco P. Felix Memorial National High School in order to come back in her Home School served for more than 13 years. And to plan in her retirement in July 2015, In her administration, 2 Department Chairmen were promoted to principals. In January 2014, Mrs. Mila N. Ramirez, Chairman of Mathematics Department was promoted to Principal in Guinayang Annex National High School. In 2015 Ms. Anagine E. Sindac, Chairman of Filipino Department was promoted to Principal of Pintong Bukawe National High School. Their occupied positions in the Department were occupied by Mrs. Lorna Naval in Mathematics and Mrs. Erlinda C. Lariego in Filipino. In July 2015, on her 65th Birthday, Ms. Juana M.

The intervention was authorized by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, approved in New York on 17 March, in response to the Libyan Civil War, though some governments allege participants in the operation exceeded their mandate. Overall response from governments was generally split between strong opposition and conditional support for the intervention. Libyans themselves were largely supportive of the intervention. According to a Gallup poll conducted in 2012, 75% of Libyans were in favor of the NATO intervention, compared to 22% who were opposed. A 2011 Orb International poll also found broad support for the intervention, with 85% of Libyans saying that they strongly supported the action taken to remove the Gaddafi regime. Supranational *African Union ‚Äì A committee of officials representing five member states -- Mali, Mauritania, the Republic of the Congo, South Africa, and Uganda -- was denied entry to Libya after the UN Security Council voted to establish a no-fly zone over the country. The ad hoc panel demanded an immediate end to the attacks on Libya. * ‚Äì The Secretary General of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, on 20 March said that the Arab League had wanted \\"the protection of civilians and not the shelling of more civilians\\",Arab League condemns broad Western bombing campaign in Libya Washington Post, 20 March 2011 but on 21 March reiterated his support for the operation,Arab League chief says he respects U.N. resolution Reuters, 21 March 2011 something that is in accordance with what he said on 20 March, concerning the civilian casualties caused by the foreign intervention. * ‚Äì The secretary- general of the GCC strongly endorsed the use of international force in Libya on 21 March, lauding coalition forces for \\"protecting the people from bloodshed\\". GCC member state Qatar is joining coalition efforts to enforce the no-fly zone. * Intergovernmental Authority on Development - The Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) described the military intervention in Libya as an open invitation to terrorists. IGAD said, \\"Our fear is that what is happening now in Libya may motivate terrorist groups in Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq to regroup on African soil.\\".The consensus on intervention in Libya has shattered, Governments =Arab World= * ‚Äì The Movement of Society for Peace, a Muslim Brotherhood-linked pro-government party in Algiers, called upon the coalition to halt military strikes against targets in Libya and urged the Arab League to affirm a \\"crystal clear and frank position on the side of the Libyan people\\". At a press conference after meeting with President Abdulaziz Bouteflika, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russia and Algeria both oppose the international intervention in Libya on principle. On 21 March, Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci said his government believes \\"this intervention to be disproportionate in relation to the objective set out by the United Nations Security Council resolution\\" and demanded \\"an immediate cessation of hostilities and foreign intervention.\\" The government has reportedly refused to allow coalition aircraft to pass through Algerian airspace during operations in Libya. * ‚Äì After the UN Security Council voted to establish a Libyan no-fly zone, Egypt declined to join in enforcement, despite having the largest military in the Arab League and voting with that body to endorse the no-fly zone's creation. Foreign Minister Nabil Elaraby said Egypt was choosing to stay out of the conflict due to the large number of Egyptian nationals in Libya. Presidential candidate Amr Moussa, the head of the Arab League, described airstrikes against Gaddafi's military in support of the UN mandate as \\"bombardment of civilians ... [that] led to the deaths and injuries of many Libyan civilians\\" and said he intended to call an emergency meeting of the Arab League, multiple members of which are now involved in enforcing the no-fly zone, to respond to the situation. Namibian press reported in early April that Egyptian embassy officials in Windhoek had indicated the Egyptian government's support for the resolution provided it led to the protection of civilians and the promotion of democracy. * ‚Äì A spokesman for the Iraqi government told Reuters on 21 March that Baghdad backs the military intervention that followed \\"to protect the Libyan people\\". Powerful Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, however, criticized both the international action and the Gaddafi regime, saying the government in Tripoli should relinquish power but warning that airstrikes could cause civilian casualties. * ‚Äì The government was party to an international summit on 19 March in Paris to weigh military intervention in Libya after the UN Security Council voted to create a no-fly zone over the country, but a government spokesman said Jordan's armed forces would not be involved in enforcing the UN mandate. On 4 April, two Royal Jordanian Air Force fighter jets arrived at a military airbase in the European Union to support the coalition. Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh said they would provide \\"logistical support\\" and help escort Jordanian transports making use of the humanitarian corridor to deliver aid and supplies. Judeh also said his government was prepared to \\"pursue efforts at all levels\\" to help protect civilians and end the crisis. * ‚Äì The government approved of the creation of the no-fly zone. UK Prime Minister David Cameron announced Kuwait would be making a \\"logistical contribution\\" to international military efforts in Libya. * ‚Äì Lebanon introduced and voted for United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, claiming to act on behalf of the Arab League. * ‚Äì President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz condemned international intervention in Libya after France, the United States, and the United Kingdom spearheaded airstrikes against Gaddafi's forces in support of a UN mandate. * ‚Äì The government was party to international talks in Paris on 19 March to discuss how to implement the UN mandate in Libya after the UN Security Council voted for a no-fly zone. After meeting with an envoy from Gaddafi's government, Foreign Minister Taieb Fassi Fihri said on 18 April, \\"Morocco considers that ... the solution can not be military. It can only be political, forward-looking and allowing the Libyan people to democratically determine their future.\\" Fihri also said that his government participated in recent conferences with members of the international coalition and allies, including the Paris summit, to help honor its \\"commitment to full respect for Libya's territorial integrity and national unity\\". * ‚Äì The government confirmed it was dispatching Qatar Emiri Air Force fighter jets to Libya on 20 March. \\"Qatar will take part in the military operation out of belief in the need for Arab states to contribute, for the situation has become unbearable in Libya\\", Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani said. * ‚Äì The government is reportedly allowing coalition airplanes to traverse Sudanese airspace during operations in Libya. * ‚Äì The post-revolution government of Tunisia declined to join international military operations in Libya, with a spokesman saying it was \\"out of the question\\". * ‚Äì The United Arab Emirates Air Force was to be involved in enforcing the no-fly zone, but the government opted to narrow its mission to providing humanitarian aid before reversing itself and sending 12 fighter jets to the Mediterranean to support international efforts. On 20 April, Al Arabiya reported that the government called for more airstrikes, insisting that Gaddafi must leave Libya and would not do so peacefully. =Middle East= * ‚Äì An official in the office of President Ilham Aliyev recommended that the government formally approve of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, saying, \\"Ensuring the security of civilians in Libya is, of course, an important issue\\", though he complained that the UN was acting swiftly to stop Gaddafi's alleged crimes but was not making the same effort to enforce resolutions on Nagorno-Karabakh that the Azerbaijani government contends its neighbor Armenia has violated. * ‚Äì The United Kingdom is making use of its military bases in Cyprus to support coalition forces enforcing the naval blockade and no-fly zone in the Libyan theater. President Dimitris Christofias said his government does not support the intervention and is unhappy over the UK making use of the bases, though he acknowledged the UK has the legal right to do so, as they lie within its overseas territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia on the island. Christofias has previously expressed his desire to see the British military presence removed from Cyprus. * ‚Äì On 21 March, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused the West of having \\"come after Libyan oil\\". He also stressed that \\"Iran utterly condemns the behaviour of the Libyan government against its people, the killings and pressure on people, and the bombing of its cities... but it (also) condemns the military action in Libya\\". Khamenei stated that he support sending mediators rather than bombing the country. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said \\"UN Should have sent mediators to Libya, not NATO Bombs\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNEKnqi9NQQ Iran's Ambassador to the UN Mohammad Khazaei said on 17 March 2011: \\"Iran has showed that it is not interested in meddling in any country's internal affairs, nor wants military presence, and thus condemns any such actions.\\" * ‚Äì Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said, \\"Western intervention in Libya will have a positive ripple effect in Iran and elsewhere in the region\\". Netanyahu also said \\"I would expect that the world put similar pressure on Iran. Iran is at least equal to Libya, and I believe that its importance is even greater.\\" However, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman suggested Israel should keep its distance from the Libyan opposition,https://newrepublic.com/article/world/magazine/97278/saif- qadaffi-libya while the Deputy Minister for the Development of Negev and the Galilee Ayoob Kara conducted talks with the Libyan government, represented by Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, for Israel to lobby the United States against intervention in exchange for the establishment of official relations and for Libyan assistance in the release of a Hamas captive. The negotiations continued until the opposition took control of Tripoli. * ‚Äì After initially opposing international intervention in Libya, on 20 March, the Foreign Ministry released a statement after the UN Security Council voted to impose a no-fly zone over the North African state saying \\"Turkey will make the necessary and appropriate national contribution on grounds that the operation will protect the interest of the Libyan people ... and provide them salvation\\". Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu, who leads the opposition Republican People's Party, endorsed international military action in Libya, saying, \\"If the United Nations has passed such a resolution, then this [operation] has gained international legitimacy\\", and praising Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan's shift toward supporting the no-fly zone and other measures. On 21 March, Turkey's representative to NATO blocked the alliance, many members of which have already deployed forces to the Mediterranean for action in Libya, from formally joining enforcement of the Libyan no-fly zone, though Turkey voted along with the rest of NATO members for enforcement of a less controversial arms embargo. A deal was ultimately reached through intensive negotiations between Ankara, London, Paris, and Washington for NATO to assume responsibility for the no-fly zone as well. =Sub-Saharan Africa= * - Angolan Foreign Affairs Minister, Georges Chikoti, said on 29 March 2011 in Luanda, that the Angolan Government defends dialogue for the resolution of the Libyan deadlock instead of a military intervention. Speaking to the press about the current international matters, the minister said that any military intervention may contribute to the worsening of the problem. According to him, this military intervention method may not be considered as a standard to solve problems in Africa. In addition, the official recalled that the situation started with demonstrations, which were repressed violently by Libyan authorities, a situation that must be slammed by the international community. He said that with the emergence of armed rebels the country dived in a kind of civil war.(Republic of Angola (Xyami) blogspot, 29 March 2011) * ‚Äì President Ian Khama was strongly supportive of the resolution, saying all countries should support the \\"well-intended\\" international intervention. \\"The least we can hope for from this intervention is the intended protection from brutality, leading to death in many cases, of Libyan citizens opposed to Muammar Gaddafi and his dictatorship\\", said Khama. * ‚Äì After meeting with President Paul Biya, the French ambassador to Cameroon said Biya concurs with the French position supporting the no-fly zone and the need for a ceasefire in Libya, the state- owned media outlet Cameroon Radio & Television reported on 28 March. * ‚Äì President Idriss D√©by Itno, who came to power with Libyan help, criticized the Western military intervention, warning it could have \\"heavy consequences\\" and worrying about the precedent it set.

The settlement of the conflict is an internal affair of Libya and should be carried out by the Libyan people alone without military intervention from outside.\\" * ‚Äì The government committed several F-16 Fighting Falcon jets and at least one ship to aid in enforcing the UN mandate in Libya. * ‚Äì On 17 March, Bosnia and Herzegovina voted for a United Nations Security Council resolution to establish a Libyan no-fly zone in its capacity as a nonpermanent member. * ‚Äì Prime Minister Boyko Borisov made an official statement supporting the resolution and called for Gaddafi to step down, but told TV7 that the intervention was an \\"adventure\\" oil grab by the western powers. President Georgi Purvanov criticised the intervention, and said that NATO should have had a unanimous support for it. Foreign Minister Nikolai Mladenov dissented from Purvanov's position, calling the president's comments \\"absurd\\" and criticising him for airing his misgivings publicly. * ‚Äì President Ivo Josipoviƒá said that if it becomes necessary Croatia will honour its NATO membership and participate in the actions in Libya. He also stressed that while Croatia is ready for military participation according to its capabilities, it will mostly endeavor to help on the humanitarian side. * ‚Äì There was a considerable debate in the Czech Republic over its stance on Libya. Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg appears to have flipflopped throughout the discussion. On 22 February, Schwarzenberg joined Georgian diplomat Vashadze in calling for the West to \\"punish\\" Gaddafi for his \\"violent actions. On 24 February, Schwarzenberg changed his stance to saying that the West should stay out of Libya. On 1 March, Schwarzenberg said that the West should intervene only if disaster threatened. On 20 March, Schwarzenberg said the EU should not \\"get involved too much\\", adding, \\"If Gaddafi falls, then there will be bigger catastrophes in the world. It's no use for anyone if we intervene there loudly, just to prove our own importance.\\" On 21 March, Schwarzenberg appeared to backtrack after facing criticism for allegedly boosting Gaddafi saying, \\"At the moment, as long as the weapons are speaking, we can only hope and urge for this [conflict] to stop.\\" The Czech Republic supports the EU's call for an \\"immediate end\\" to violence against civilians in Libya. On the same day, Schwarzenburg went further to say that the Czech Republic would join the operation if requested, suggesting that they could deploy their chemical unit if Gaddafi used chemical weapons; he also offered to take part in humanitarian aid. Schwarzenburg and Vondra still expressed some doubts about the operation, they went further to slam Russian and Chinese obstruction as \\"hypocritical\\". They further said that NATO should lead the operation and that it would be inappropriate once that was the case for member nations to adopt separate stances. President V√°clav Klaus is against the no-fly zone over Libya, saying enforcing a no-fly zone effectively constitutes a war.Czech President Klaus is against no-fly zone over Libya The same day, former president V√°clav Havel released a statement criticizing Klaus' stance and saying that intervention was necessary as Gaddafi was an \\"insane dictator\\" and that by not intervening, the EU and NATO would be \\"risking lives\\". Havel further extrapolated Klaus' stance on Libya to the stances of those who \\"hesitated\\" with regard to Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, and stated that views of that kind had allowed \\"had allowed many grave horrors to be committed\\". Klaus responded that he \\"opposed Havel's comments\\". The Czech Republic's Prime Minister, Petr Neƒças, stated clearly on 18 March that the Czech Republic would not be involved in the implementation of the UN resolution, although he didn't rule out participation in humanitarian actions. A 30 March poll showed that Czechs were divided in whether they support the mission, with a near 50‚Äì50 split on support, but despite this, 70.1% opposed Czech involvement in the no-fly zone. * ‚Äì On 19 March, the Danish Parliament voted unanimously to send fighter jets to enforce the no-fly zone, marking the only time so far in the nation's history that military commitment was supported by full parliamentary unity. * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Urmas Paet told Estonian Public Broadcasting on 18 March that his government does not plan to participate in international military operations against Libya, but it would join them if requested to do so by NATO or the EU. * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Stubb said his government has \\"considered\\" participating in coalition efforts in Libya, but ruled out sending the Finnish Air Force's F/A-18 Hornets to enforce the no-fly zone and said he did not see a role for Finland in the coalition. President Tarja Halonen explained, \\"We are not, in this respect, a country that really specialises in air forces.\\" She also warned, \\"Any use of force casts long shadows\\", opining that the international intervention could stretch on for \\"longer than we now believe\\". * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle was skeptical of the no-fly zone and on 15 March called the idea \\"potentially dangerous\\" although he recommended greater political pressure be put on the Libyan leader. Accordingly, Germany, which was a non-permanent member of the UN security council, abstained from resolution 1973 on Libya. This decision was criticised from various political sides in Germany,dradio.de: Kritik an Enthaltung bei Libyen-Resolution, March 20, 2011 including his CDU coalition partners, saying it was a \\"mistake of historical dimension\\".spiegel.de: \\"Schwerer Fehler von historischer Dimension\\", March 26, 2011 * ‚Äì Foreign Minister J√°nos Martonyi said that Hungary \\"is glad that this decree came to life, the UN made the right decision\\". He also noted that he wished such a decision would have been made sooner to save more civilian lives. * ‚Äì Foreign Minister ƒ¢irts Valdis Kristovskis affirmed his government's support for the UN resolution, saying it was \\"unacceptable for the international community to remain in an observer's role\\" during the crisis. \\"The people of Libya ... should themselves decide their future, and therefore conditions should be put in place for them to do so freely\\", Kristovskis added. He also praised NATO's decision to take over international operations in the Libyan theater, saying it \\"raises hope that a sustainable solution will be achieved\\". * ‚Äì On 24 March, Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said his government \\"generally welcomes\\" the resolution, to which he insisted on \\"strict adherence\\" on the part of coalition forces. Juncker added that he wanted NATO to take control of coalition military efforts in Libya as soon as possible. * ‚Äì In a statement dated 21 March, the government in Skopje said it \\"supports and joins\\" efforts to enforce the UN mandate in Libya and called for a \\"peaceful and sustainable solution\\" to the political crisis in the country. * ‚Äì President George Abela expressed strong support for the no-fly zone, telling The Australian on 27 March that \\"it has eliminated Gaddafi's air force\\", though he fretted the intervention might not have been \\"timely enough\\". * ‚Äì On 22 March, the Netherlands agreed to aid military involvement. The government sent six F-16 Fighting Falcon, a naval ship, a refuelling jet and about 200 personnel to Libya. They would not attack ground targets, but would be helping maintain the arms embargo. * ‚Äì On 19 March, the government authorized the Royal Norwegian Air Force to head for Libya and prepare for missions there. Norway approved six General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters and necessary personnel.http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/03/20/nyheter/libya/utenriks/muammar_kadhafi/kadhafi/15879797/ * ‚Äì Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced that Polish soldiers would not take military action in Libya, although he voiced support for the UN Resolution and pledged to offer logistical support. Tusk stated in an interview that he was unenthusiastic about the operation. * ‚Äì Russia abstained from voting on a UN Security Council resolution to create a no-fly zone over Libya rather than use its veto to block the resolution. Days later, the Foreign Ministry said that it noted \\"with regret this armed action, taken in conjunction with the hastily passed U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973\\". On 21 March, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin described the resolution as \\"defective and flawed\\" stating that it \\"resembles medieval calls for crusades\\", comments that were later called \\"unacceptable\\" by President Dmitry Medvedev. On the same day Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov commented after a meeting with the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, that Moscow supported the Arab League resolution which had called for a no-fly zone over Libya. * ‚Äì The government issued a statement saying that Serbia is deeply concerned about the situation in Libya, especially the risks to the lives of civilians. The statement said that Serbia calls for the respect of UN Security Council Resolution 1973 and international humanitarian law in order to immediately stop civilian deaths and further demolition of the country and that Serbia fully endorses Libya's territorial integrity and wholeness. Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremiƒá called on all three sides to immediately put an end to all military operations for the sake of protecting civilian lives. The ruling party representative MP in the National Assembly stated that while Serbia has a clear position to advocate for the respect of human rights it has a reason to believe that bombing a country is not the happiest way to reach the realization of human rights. * ‚Äì The government \\"welcomed\\" the adoption of the resolution, which neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina voted to approve, by the United Nations Security Council. * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Carl Bildt announced that his government would consider military action in support of a no-fly zone if it is requested by NATO. On 29 March, the government approved the deployment of JAS 39 Gripen multirole jet fighters to Libya to enforce the no-fly zone, though it included the stipulation that they will not be used to carry out airstrikes unless they are targeted by surface-to-air missiles or anti-aircraft artillery. * ‚Äì The government \\"recognized\\" the UN Security Council's decision to mandate action on 18 March. Defence Minister Ueli Maurer said he didn't think the no-fly zone or airstrikes would be sufficient to stop Gaddafi. Maurer said he supported the resolution but wanted Switzerland to remain neutral in the conflict. Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey said that the Swiss policy of neutrality extended to the conflict, though she suggested that allowing coalition aircraft to use Swiss airspace for conducting operations over Libya was not a violation of that policy. * ‚Äì In a statement on 21 March, President Viktor Yanukovych acknowledged the resolution and said Ukraine would comply with its provisions, but expressed caution and reiterated Kiev's opposition to any effort by a foreign power to occupy Libya. Ukraine, he added, would continue to focus on efforts to evacuate civilians and nationals of Ukraine and its allies from Libya. \\"It is fundamentally important for us that even despite the establishment of a no-fly zone over the territory of Libya, all the possibilities of providing humanitarian aid and evacuation of civilians were preserved\\", Yanukovych said. * ‚Äì On 21 March, Parliament voted 557 to 13 in favour of the military involvement. A ComRes/ITN survey found that only one in three UK citizens agree with the decision to take military action in Libya although the Londoners polled in the survey \\"agreed they would like to see Gaddafi removed, but not through bombing.\\" A poll by YouGov a few days later showed that more of the British public supported the no-fly zone than not. =Oceania= * ‚Äì After the creation of a no-fly zone, which Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd vocally supported, Prime Minister Julia Gillard voiced strong support for international military action in the skies above Libya, though Defence Minister Stephen Smith said he does not expect Australia will send military assets to the theatre beyond possibly supplying humanitarian efforts with Royal Australian Air Force transport planes like the C-17 Globemaster. * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Murray McCully praised the United Nations Security Council's vote to create of a no-fly zone over Libya, but added that he worried \\"it will be a case of too little too late\\". Prime Minister John Key also lauded the vote and international efforts in Libya, noting that New Zealand is adopting sanctions against Gaddafi's regime, but said he doesn't think New Zealand has much to offer in military assets for the no-fly zone. Although Key said he would not commit military support, he said, \\"It's quite clear that Gaddafi has been undertaking violence against his people, it's abhorrent, we want to see that end, and we do want to see a smooth and peaceful transition to a new leader.\\" Labour Party leader Phil Goff echoed the government's support for intervention and said a solution should be sought as so not to leave the conflict at an \\"impasse\\". * ‚Äì On 27 March, Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Shanel Agovaka said his government supports the resolution. \\"Solomon Islands will always support any resolution that aims to protect human rights and in this situation Resolution 1973 is fully supported\\", said Agovaka. =Non-UN member governments= * ‚Äì The Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a letter from the \\"Association of Youth Organizations in Abkhazia\\" decrying the intervention and calling upon Foreign Affairs Minister Maksim Gundjia to communicate the opposition of \\"Abkhazian Youth\\" to \\"the war and violence of any kind\\" in both English and Russian on its website. *- According to a report by SE Times, Kosovo Albanians, likening Gaddafi's actions against the opposition to those of Milosevic twelve years earlier, widely sympathized with the rebels and were avid supporters of the idea of a no-fly zone. Secondary reasons that were told to reporters included the autocracy in Libya under Gaddafi, as well as Gaddafi's support for Milosevic and opposition to Kosovo's independence. Likewise, the Kosovar government supported the air strikes, with Hashim Thaci saying that \\"\\"Kosovo understands the importance of such interventions from 1999, and supports the efforts of the Libyan people for freedom and democracy, in becoming an important country of the Arab world\\". * ‚Äì MOFA spokesman James Chang said government ministries were monitoring the conflict but did not believe the oil supply to the ROC's main island of Taiwan would be disrupted. The government also warned Gaddafi to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 and stand down his forces. * ‚Äì Pope Benedict XVI called for an immediate ceasefire by all sides. \\"I appeal to international organisations and those with political and military responsibilities to immediately launch a dialogue to suspend the use of arms\\", the pope said in the Vatican. NGOs * The International Federation for Human Rights stated that it welcomed the resolution which finally offers protection to civilians in Libya, who are the targets of crimes which can be considered crimes against humanity.Staff (18 March 2011). \\"Security Council Resolution 1973 : FIDH Welcomes This Resolution Which Offers Protection to Civilians in Libya\\". International Federation for Human Rights. Retrieved 27 March 2011. * Kenneth Roth, executive director of the Human Rights Watch, stated that the Security Council at last lived up to its duty to prevent mass atrocities. He further commented the Arab League's role, stating that \\"the league had watched silently as Sudan's Omar al-Bashir committed crimes against humanity in Darfur -- or, less recently, as Iraq's Saddam Hussein massacred Shia and Kurds, and Syria's Hafez al-Asad destroyed the town of Hama. But the league apparently sensed the winds of change wafting through the Middle East and North Africa, and felt compelled to respond.\\" * In January 2012, independent human rights groups published a report describing the human rights violations committed by NATO during the conflict and accusing NATO of war crimes. Individuals Muslim Brotherhood-linked Egyptian scholar Yusuf al- Qaradawi expressed his support for the no-fly zone put in place by the United Nations over Libya, saying, \\"The operation in Libya is to protect the civilians from Gaddafi's tyranny.\\" Qaradawi also slammed Arab League leader and likely presidential candidate Amr Moussa for remarks criticizing the international intervention. In the United States, the U.S. role in the intervention was criticized by prominent leaders of the U.S. Tea Party movement. On April 4, 2011, for instance, Tea Party leader Michael Johns, a former Heritage Foundation policy expert on global affairs, criticized Obama's Libyan intervention, saying \\"this mess of a policy is what it looks like to have a community organizer running American foreign policy.\\"\\"Foreign policy expert Michael Johns sits down with the WE to discuss Libya, U.S. participation, and President Obama's handling of the situation,\\" The Western Experience, April 4, 2011. Former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano expressed \\"uncertainty\\" toward the no-fly zone imposed by the UN Security Council. \\"The military measures should not damage the people more than the regime\\", Chissano said. The leader of the Muslim general council in Tanzania called international military intervention in support of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 an attack on Islam and described it as \\"barbaric\\" and a \\"massacre\\". The council called for an immediate ceasefire. A French MEP and president of the National Front, Marine Le Pen claimed that the transfer of the US command towards NATO increased the submissiveness of the French Armed Forces. Denouncing \\"the US supremacy\\" in the military intervention, she \\"refused the idea that France slavishly followed the USA in this new stalemate\\". One month after the launching of hostilities, she claimed that France sank into Sarkozy's vote-catching war in Libya. She noticed that \\"the United Nations' mandate had largely been overstepped\\" and that \\"the deaths of civilians increased\\". Denouncing the planned dispatch of British, French and Italian military advisers to Libya and \\"Sarkozy's lies\\" about the war, she lamented the decision of the French authorities to compromise further France in \\"a new Afghanistan\\". Noam Chomsky has criticized the intervention, saying that \\"[t]here was no effort to institute a no-fly zone. The triumvirate at once interpreted the resolution as authorizing direct participation on the side of the rebels. A ceasefire was imposed by force on Gaddafi's forces, but not on the rebels. On the contrary, they were given military support as they advanced to the West, soon securing the major sources of Libya's oil production, and poised to move on.\\" He has questioned the motives of overthrowing Gaddafi, saying, \\"the vast territory of Libya is mostly unexplored, and oil specialists believe it may have rich untapped resources, which a more dependable government might open to Western exploitation.\\" References Libyan Civil War (2011) Foreign relations of Libya Libya 2011 in international relations ","title":"International reactions to the 2011 military intervention in Libya"},{"id":"31279791","text":"Enteropathic arthropathy or enteropathic arthritis refers to acute or subacute arthritis in association with, or as a reaction to, an enteric (usually colonic) inflammatory condition.

Early life and education Lauck is the American author of four books including the New York Times best seller Blackbird. Her writing has been published in the U.S. and around the world, translated into several languages. Much of her popularity began when she appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show in 2000 and Winfrey held the book up to her audience saying, \\"This should have been a book of the month book. Read it now.\\" Blackbird debuted on The New York Times Best Seller list in November 2000, dropping off and then returning in January 2001. Born in Reno, Nevada, Lauck split her early childhood between the states of Nevada and California, with her adoptive family. After her mother died in 1971, Lauck remained with her adoptive father and brother until her father died in 1973. At that time, Lauck was separated from her adoptive brother and raised in Nevada and Washington state, adopted a second time by the paternal side of her adoptive family. Professional career Lauck's adulthood was spent in Washington, Montana and Oregon where she studied journalism at Montana State University and then took a reporting job with the Montana Television Network. Lauck's journalism career took her to Spokane, Washington, where she worked for KXLY- TV, then Portland, Oregon, where she worked for KATU-TV as a news producer and special reports producer. Her reports, investigative journalism, appeared on CNN and the ABC Nightly News. She has been nominated for several Society of Journalists awards and won Best News Story of the year for her report on an abduction case in Washington State. Lauck discussed her reasons for writing her first and subsequent memoirs with Literary Mama, \\"...memoir writing was born from the realization that I wanted to have children. I knew I had to go through some deep self-examination before bringing forth a child and I knew traditional avenues of therapy would never give me the insights and relative self-mastery I needed to be a competent mother.\\" The international bestseller Blackbird detailed Lauck's memory of childhood and was followed by her next book, Still Waters, that took her to her 30s and the birth of her first child. In Still Waters, Lauck describes her writing of her second book as attempt to understand the suicide death of her adoptive brother, whom she was separated from as a young girl. She followed Still Waters with a collection of short stories titled Show Me the Way, in which she took a closer look at her parenting of her two children. She also wrote and published essays for Literary Mama and anthology collections on parenting. Moved by the number of letters received in support for her writing, as well as the sharing of personal tragedies in those fan letters, Lauck felt ill-equipped to respond skillfully and turned to study of Tibetan Buddhism under American masters Anne Klein, Harvey Aronson, Joanna Macy, and Lama Tsultrim Allione, as well as Tibetan master Adzom Rinpoche. While studying Buddhist theory and practicing meditation, Lauck turned her writing toward larger spiritual questions, publishing several essays in Lion's Roar and Buddha Dharma. In 2007, Lauck continued to explore her life further and discovered the impact of her adoption through studies with adoption experts Nancy Verrier, author of The Primal Wound, and Coming Home to Self, and Betty Jean Lifton, author of several books on the topic of adoption. After hiring an investigator, Lauck found her original birth family and reunited with them in 2008. Seal Press released her fourth memoir, titled Found: A Memoir & True Sequel to Blackbird, focused on the impact of adoption and Lauck's reunion with her birth family. Lauck has a BA in journalism from Montana State University and MFA in creative writing from Pacific Lutheran University and has taught writing for 12 years, most recently for The Attic Institute, as a Senior Fellow. Lauck travels to speak on a variety of topics including motherhood, empowerment of women, writing, adoption, foster care, abandonment, early loss, Tibetan Buddhism, and mediation.

He led the New Democratic Party of Quebec from April to September 1989 and helped bring about its autonomy from the New Democratic Party of Canada. Early life and political career before 1989 Nadeau was born in Joliette in 1953.Angus: Du grand capital √† l'√©conomie sociale: Au sujet de l'auteur, Publications Gouvernementales, accessed 24 March 2011. He was a Parti Qu√©b√©cois (PQ) activist before joining the New Democratic Party and served as an executive assistant to legislator Guy Chevrette.\\"Quebec NDP members divided on forming a provincial party,\\" Globe and Mail, 20 March, A5. He was also a supporter of the municipal Montreal Citizens' Movement (MCM) and served on its economy committee. In 1988, he criticized the party's pro-business direction in government.Lewis Harris, \\"MCM dissidents leave their mark; Half a dozen councillors emerge as strongest opposition at city hall,\\" Montreal Gazette, 12 March 1988, B4; \\"The RACE for Montreal,\\" Montreal Gazette, 2 October 1988, B6. He ran for the House of Commons of Canada as the New Democratic Party candidate for Hochelaga‚ÄîMaisonneuve in the 1988 federal election. He criticized the proposed Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement on the grounds that it would hurt manufacturing jobs in his riding. Nadeau was considered one of the party's strongest candidates in Quebec, and some party insiders believed he had a chance for an upset victory.Bertrand Marotte, \\"Constituents bitter in Montreal riding,\\" Globe and Mail, 14 November 1988, A5. In the event, he finished third against Progressive Conservative candidate Allan Koury. Shortly before election day, Nadeau and six other NDP candidates with Quebec nationalist views held a press conference to denounce Canada's policies on bilingualism.Peter Kuitenbrouwer, \\"Quebec NDP splits from federal party,\\" Montreal Gazette, 1 May 1989, A1. New Democratic Party leader Nadeau was elected to lead the Quebec New Democratic Party in April 1989, defeating incumbent leader Roland Morin. The election contest was centred on the Quebec NDP's relationship with the federal party. At the time, the NDP had a single party organization in Quebec that was responsible for both federal and provincial matters. Several members of the Quebec NDP opposed its links to the federal party, particularly in light of ideological divisions on issues relating to Quebec nationalism. The Quebec party supported the province's Charter of the French Language, opposed the Meech Lake Accord, and were sceptical toward the Canadian constitution because it was approved without Quebec's support.\\"Quebec NDP to review links to federal party,\\" Globe and Mail, 29 April 1989, A9. Nadeau favoured the creation of a separate provincial party, while Morin initially opposed it before declaring his neutrality.\\"Quebec NDP members divided on forming a provincial party,\\" Globe and Mail, 20 March, A5. Nadeau, who was thirty-five years old at the time, also highlighted the generational divide between himself and the fifty-seven- year-old Morin. He said, \\"The leadership choice is clearly between a democratic socialist who has a vision for the '90s and one who is clinging to the outdated notions of the '70s.\\" For his part, Morin described Nadeau as a single-issue candidate focused only on the environment.\\"Quebec NDP to review links to federal party,\\" Globe and Mail, 29 April 1989, A9. Nadeau defeated Morin at a party convention held on April 30, 1989, as the party also voted to separate from the federal organization and become a completely distinct entity.Andre Picard, \\"Quebec NDP opts for autonomy,\\" Globe and Mail, 1 May 1989, A1. The NDP ran fifty-five candidates in the 1989 election.Andre Picard, \\"Quebec's political fringe filled with choices,\\" 21 September 1989, A5 Its campaign began in confusion, when the party executive approved an election platform that Nadeau derided as \\"naive Marxism.\\" He initially threatened to resign as party leader, but refrained when the executive agreed to withdraw the offending document. Nadeau later described the platform as having resulted from the \\"fertile imagination\\" of a single party worker who misunderstood the instructions of its policy committee.William Johnson, \\"Anglo mentality needs changing,\\" Montreal Gazette, 17 August 1989, B3; Lewis Harris, \\"NDP ready to uncover new platform,\\" Montreal Gazette, 18 August 1989, A4. Nadeau secured a more prominent place for environmental issues in the party's revised platform, but he could not prevent party activists from adding a focus on Quebec nationalism. Nadeau opposed this on strategic grounds, arguing that it would not help the party build support.Graeme Hamilton, \\"Quebec NDP OK's nationalist stance,\\" Montreal Gazette, 20 August 1989, A6. Others argued that it prevented the party from winning support among anglophone Liberals who were disgruntled with the nationalist policies of premier Robert Bourassa.Elisabeth Kalbfuss, \\"NDP bright lights have switched their allegiance,\\" Montreal Gazette, 21 September 1989, A12. Close to election day, Nadeau acknowledged that his party would not win any seats in the legislature.Elisabeth Kalbfuss, \\"NDP bright lights have switched their allegiance,\\" Montreal Gazette, 21 September 1989, A12. The NDP received about one per cent of the popular vote, and Nadeau received only 437 votes for a distant fourth-place finish in the Montreal division of Dorion. He resigned as party leader on September 26, 1989, one day after the election, saying that the Quebec NDP would never be able to succeed because of a \\"hard core of Marxists\\" hindering its development.Andre Picard, \\"Marxist members blamed for Quebec NDP's demise,\\" Globe and Mail, 27 September 1989, A5.

'Triumph of Narrow Gauge' Boolarong Press 1990 It carried coal and sugar products and serviced the Millaquin sugar mill. A crossing of Saltwater Creek a short distance east of Bundaberg station was necessary, and sidings were located at Barolin Street, Tantitha Street and (later) Woongarra Junction. Woongarra Shire Council funded a 20 km extension of the line further east via East Bundaberg, Bunda Street, Rubyanna, The Grange and Mon Repos to service a sugar mill at Qunaba (derived from Queensland National Bank), then south via Neilson Park, Bargara and Hollands to service mills at Windermere and Pemberton. The extension opened on 3 December 1912 at which point the Queensland Railways Department purchased the line as far as Woongarra Junction (located near the Millaquin mill).Rackemann, N. 'Sweat Steam and Soot' Bundaberg Railway Enthusiasts Society 1988 The arrival of an excursion train at Nielson Park, circa 1931 Neilson Park had a beach and with a railway connection soon became a popular seaside destination and \\"excursion\\" trains operated on the route. Windermere and Pemberton mills were later closed and cane was railed to Qunaba for processing. Despite running at a loss, the Queensland Railways Department purchased the remainder of the line (from Woongarra Junction to Pemberton) on 1 January 1918. In 1913, a stop en route at Sandhills was renamed Bargara derived by amalgamating the words Barolin and Woongarra. A daily rail motor operated between Bundaberg and Pemberton from 1919 to 1921 but thereafter only seaside trains ran during the summer months. As occurred elsewhere, road transport took over carriage of sugar cane. A short spur from Qunaba would have brought the line to the new Bundaberg Port at the mouth of the Burnett River. However, sugar interests feared that rail strikes might interfere with production and road haulage to the port was preferred. The line from Qunaba to Pemberton closed on 30 May 1948 and from Bunda Street (a short distance east of Woongarra Junction) to Qunaba closed on 1 August 1959.

En route stops were built at Thynne, Marule, Junien, Booyal, Munderbong, Tawah, Stanton and Kukar. The Dallarnil extension should never have been built. Much of the country was infertile and the prospect of agricultural development was overestimated. Small quantities of sugarcane, railway sleepers, cream, lime and cattle were carried but only in spasmodic fashion. Two trains a week were enough to meet the low volume of traffic and the service beyond Cordalba ceased on 1 July 1955.

In 1869 copper was discovered at Mount Perry (approx 100 km west of Bundaberg) and the township grew rapidly. A railway to the coast was essential to provide cheap transport and make the mining of low percentage ore viable. Maryborough and Bundaberg vied for the opportunity to be the terminus and the latter city was successful. Survey A survey dated 20 March 1875 proposed a line from North Bundaberg, thus avoiding an expensive bridge over the Burnett River, west to Gin Gin and then via the old road and telegraph route to Moolboolaman but still some distance short of Mount Perry. There were delays in gaining official approval for the line to the extent that, when Queensland Parliament finally approved construction, mining at Mount Perry was substantially curtailed. Opening The first 65 kilometre section from North Bundaberg railway station (originally called Bundaberg station) to Moolboolaman opened on 19 July 1881. The stops were at Oakwood, Sharon, Manoo, Bingera, Birthamba, Koolboo, Goondoon, Hilo, Bullyard, Tagon, Maroondan, Uping, McIlwraith, Gin Gin, Tookie, Watawa, Tirroan, Guragila and Daylsford. Construction of the first stage predated the completion of the North Coast line from Maryborough to Bundaberg by some seven years and it was only then that Bundaberg station was renamed North Bundaberg. Extensions There followed extensions to Gillen‚Äôs Siding opened on 15 August 1882, then via Goyan and Ellimatta to Boolboonda opened on 12 November 1883, and lastly via Wonbah, Wolca and Drummer‚Äôs Creek to Mount Perry opened on 20 May 1884. A feature of the last stage of the line was construction of the Boolboonda Tunnel. Excavated a distance of 192 metres through solid rock, the tunnel is the longest unsupported tunnel in the southern hemisphere. Completion of the final stage meant that a service leaving Mount Perry at 7.30am took 4 ¬Ω hours to reach Bundaberg before departing at 3.00 pm for the return journey. Locomotives For information, see text Information about locomotives is sketchy. The locomotive pictured on the right was apparently used from 1881 to 1890. The description of the photo reads: > \\"Steam locomotive with a group of men gathered around it, ca. 1880 This > locomotive has a plate on the side of the cabin with the words 'Railway > Works Ipswich Queensland 1877' inscribed. The locomotive was built at > Ipswich Railway Workshops in 1877. It was known as an A10 class steam > locomotive (or an Ipswich A10). It ran on the southern and western railway, > as Locomotive 36, until 1881 when it operated on the Bundaberg Railway. In > 1890 it was sold to contractors building part of the Bundaberg - Gladstone > railway and in 1892 sold again to Young Brothers of Fairymead Mill, > Bundaberg. It was used initially on trains at Avonside, then at the mill at > North Bundaberg. Its boiler exploded at Avondale in the early 1890s. In 1935 > it was replaced by a locomotive purchased from Mount Lyall in Tasmania but > its remains were not disposed of until 1951.\\" Traffic Two trains a week operated after the Moolboolaman opening but a rapid rise in timber transport necessitated three trains a week in 1883 and daily services in 1884. Sugar cane traffic increased quickly when a mill was opened at Bingera in 1885. Although mining activities dwindled, timber transport took over to some degree until copper mining again became viable in the early 1900s. Until then, the line ran at a loss but high copper prices saw large scale mining return to Mount Perry and provide the railway and town with a new lease of life. Accident Railway carriages derailed at Gillen Siding on the Mount Perry branch line, 1924 A fatal accident resulted after a derailment near Gillen‚Äôs Siding early on Sunday 17 February 1924. The train was on an holiday excursion from Mount Perry to Bargara. Two people died in the incident which was deemed to have been caused by excessive speed and negligence by the driver and guard. Closure Transportation of timber, sugar and dairy products continued until it became uneconomical for the service to continue. The line closed in stages ‚Äì from Mount Perry to Tirroan (just west of Gin Gin) on 31 October 1960, from Tirroan to Gin Gin in 1988, Gin Gin station on 17 January 1992 and the line to North Bundaberg on 16 January 1993. Heritage listings The Mount Perry railway line has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Boolboonda Tunnel * North Bundaberg railway station. About 1994, North Bundaberg station building was relocated some 500 metres west to the opposite side of the track and is now part of the Bundaberg Railway Museum.. * Splitters Creek Railway Bridge. Although avoiding a bridge over the Burnett River, the route could not avoid a crossing of Splitters Creek, a Burnett tributary located a short distance to the west. This imposing heritage listed structure towers high over the creek and features steel rods which link the trestles to provide extra strength. Industrial railways Industrial railways (tramways) transported goods, such as sugar cane, from the production area to the main line.

It is endemic to Florida, where it is known only from a few small patches of remaining habitat in Miami-Dade County.Galactia smallii. The Nature Conservancy. It is threatened by the destruction and inadequate management of its habitat. It was federally listed as an endangered species of the United States in 1985.USFWS. Endangered and threatened status for five Florida pine rockland plants. Federal Register July 18, 1985. Description This plant is a creeping or climbing vine with gray- haired stems reaching up to 2 meters long. The shaggy hairs on the stem nodes may be up to 8 millimeters long. Each leaf is compound, made up of three hairy leaflets that measure 1 to 2 centimeters long. The inflorescence produces 1 to 5 pea flowers which are just over a centimeter long and pink to lavender in color. The flowers are pollinated by the Cassius blue butterfly (Leptotes cassius theonus) and other insects.Galactia smallii. Center for Plant Conservation. The fruit is a hairy legume pod 3 or 4 centimeters long and a few millimeters wide. Habitat This species grows in Florida's pine rockland habitat, an increasingly rare type of ecosystem dominated by the slash pine (Pinus elliottii). The trees are narrow and the canopy is open, providing sunlight to the understory. Among the pines are over 100 species of trees, including many palms, and a diverse array of herbs, including many rare and endemic species. The habitat is maintained by a natural fire regime of periodic wildfire which prevents the succession of the pine rockland to a hammock ecosystem. Fire clears overgrown tall and woody vegetation to maintain the characteristic open canopy.Pine Rockland. Florida Natural Areas Inventory. Less than 2% of the pine rocklands of Florida remain today.USFWS. Galactia smallii Five-year Review. July 2010. Management and status When this plant was added to the endangered species list it was known from only two places near Homestead, Florida. The habitat was being rapidly consumed and converted to residential tracts in the Miami metropolitan area. Remaining fragmented strips of the habitat were becoming degraded, primarily by the practice of fire suppression. The area, which would normally burn every 3 to 7 years, was becoming overgrown and the habitat was changing from pine rockland to hammock. In the absence of fire the open canopy fills in with brush and mature trees and Small's milkpea cannot tolerate the shade. Appropriate land management in the pine rocklands involves controlled burns to mimic the natural pattern. Fire also helps to prevent the encroachment of invasive plants. One of the worst offenders is Natal grass (Melinis repens). The plant is present at eight sites on public land and an unknown number of sites on private property. The County of Miami-Dade has purchased some tracts of land that contain the plant for the purpose of managing and conserving them.

The furnace was named for Isabella Potts, wife of one of the partners, a member of the Potts ironmaking family. Isabella was the last iron furnace to be built in the county, in 1835, and was operated by members of the Potts family and their partners until 1855, when they lost control of it in a bankruptcy. It returned to the family in 1881, when it was purchased by Col. Joseph Potts (nephew of Isabella), who modernized it. The furnace, the last to operate in Chester County, went out of blast in 1894, a few months after Col. Potts' death, but remained largely intact until after his son's death in 1943. The remains of the furnace complex have been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1991. History The original operators of the furnace were Henry Potts and his brother-in-law (and second cousin) John Potts Rutter, who bought a tract of land from Robert Wilson on April 1, 1835 for the furnace site.Diane B. Reed, 1991, NRHP Nomination Form for Isabella Furnace The land was along Perkins Run near where that stream emptied into the East Branch Brandywine Creek; the tract already included a fulling mill and a sawmill, and the transaction encompassed water rights to dam Perkins Run to power the furnace.Historic American Buildings Survey, No. PA-163. The Potts and Rutter families were already extensively involved in the iron business in the vicinity of Philadelphia; Henry's father Joseph was a partner in Glasgow Forge, on Manatawny Creek near Pottstown, Pennsylvania, and Henry was involved in ironmaking there and at Warwick Furnace, owned by his first cousin David Potts, Jr. The furnace was completed by the end of the year and named in honor of Henry's wife Isabella, n√©e Hitner. It proved to be the last sizable furnace erected in northern Chester County. In the spring of 1836, Henry's brother David, formerly the owner of Springton Forge, was brought in as a partner and manager of the furnace. Henry retained a half interest and David and John each a quarter interest in Isabella Furnace. Ore from the furnace was obtained from the Jones and Warwick mines nearby; partners members of the allied Potts, Rutter, and Brooke families were among the partners in the mines. In 1839 and 1840, respectively, Henry and David's brothers Robert Smith Potts and Joseph Potts were brought into the partnership. Ultimately, David bought out most of the family interest, except for a moiety held by his nephew, William A. Smith. David's nephew Charles Follen McKim, later an architect, was born at Isabella in 1847. The furnace was well-run under David's direction, and in 1850, produced of iron per year. The furnace was converted to a forge in 1853. However, changing conditions in the iron market in the mid-1850s badly damaged David's financial position. Isabella Furnace was assigned to Robert Smith Potts and Addison May, who sold it in the following year to John Irey and James Butler. Irey was a carpenter who, like David Potts, had made iron at Springton Forge. Under the new owners, the output of the forge in 1856 was of blooms. Irey bought out Butler in 1860 and thereafter operated the forge himself. During the early years of the Civil War, the East Brandywine and Waynesburg Railroad was built along the East Branch of the Brandywine on its way from Downingtown to Waynesburg, now Honey Brook. Its Wyebrooke station was about a half-mile south of the forge and provided a rail outlet for its products. The forge was remodeled in 1864 and it was presumably then that it became a furnace again, but Irey's operations during the Civil War were not profitable. He sold out in 1865 to the brothers Bentley H., William D., and Horace V. Smith, members of an ironmaking family associated with Joanna Furnace and the mines around Warwick. William D. and Horace V. Smith were particularly associated with the management of the furnace until 1881. About 1870, as the Wilmington and Reading Railroad built through the region on the way from Wilmington, Delaware to Birdsboro, Pennsylvania, it established a station called \\"Isabella\\" about a mile northwest of the furnace. In 1880, a new figure appeared upon the scene: Col. Joseph D. Potts (1829‚Äì1893), son of David Potts. Raised at Isabella Furnace, he regarded it as home. Potts made a fortune in the railroad and transportation industry, in the employ of the Pennsylvania Railroad and elsewhere. When he retired from that business, he desired to return to the property where he had been raised and become an ironmaster, like so many of his family before him. He won over the Smith brothers, who were reluctant to sell, and closed on the property on February 28, 1880. Potts was willing to make substantial investments in modernizing the furnace. His improvements included conversion from water to the more reliable steam power for creating the furnace blast. Potts also arranged for the construction of a spur line to the furnace from the East Brandywine and Waynesburg, which had come under the control of the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1876. This facilitated the shipment of raw materials to, and iron from, the furnace; in 1884, Isabella was reported to be using a combination of the local ores and imported Spanish ore to produce \\"car-wheel\\" pig iron, sold under the \\"Wyebrooke\\" brand. At this time, the annual capacity of the furnace had increased to of iron due to the modernization. Soon after buying the furnace, Col. Potts appointed his elder son, William M. Potts, manager of the furnace; William's younger brother, Francis L. Potts, was also associated with Isabella until 1886. In that year, Isabella underwent its last rebuilding. By 1892, the furnace was using a blend of local ores, ore from Lancaster County, Elba, and Lake Superior, and reported an annual capacity of . In 1891, Col. Potts began building a nearby chateau-like mansion, \\"Langoma\\" (1891‚Äì95, Theophilus P. Chandler, Jr., architect),Potts residence, from Philadelphia Architects and Buildings. which he intended as a residence for himself and his son William.Langoma Estate, from Facebook. However, he died in December 1893 and did not live to see it completed. William, his wife, and mother did move into \\"Langoma\\", but ironmaking at the furnace ended in April 1894, not long after Col. Potts' death. It was the last iron furnace operating in Chester County. The furnace and railroad spur were left largely intact, although unused. The slow dilapidation of the furnace produced a remarkable aesthetic effect. Henry Seidel Canby referred in 1935 to \\"its moldering cupola furnace, like a Persian mosque of the twelfth century, its long walls and sleepy half-drained dam.\\" This slow decay was accelerated after the death of William M. Potts in 1943, when the railroad was taken up and other metal was reclaimed for scrap. Even after this, HABS photographer Ned Goode said of the furnace in 1959 that \\"its wild setting in an over-grown field is quite striking\\". After the death of William Potts, the ruined furnace was sold by his estate to Frank Bloise, who sold it in 1945 to Langoma Industries, a clothing firm with which Bloise was involved. Langoma Industries intended to set up a clothing factory and a surrounding worker's town on the Potts estate. It was still owned by Langoma Industries in 1959. Ultimately, the property was converted to a private residence by Dr. and Mrs. Daniel Leiberman, who sold the property about 1983. Buildings Ruins at the base of the furnace stack after about a decade's abandonment. Collapsing building to left of center is the \\"wheel house\\"; building at base to right of center is the casting house. Charging bridge and crusher and charging house can be seen behind and to left of stack. The original stack of the furnace was high, with a bosh. Either the 1864 or 1881 remodeling increased the height to , with a bosh. The last remodeling, in 1886, enlarged the stack to . A Hexamer General Survey plan of the furnace made in 1890 shows a number of structures arranged along the hillside sloping down to Perkins Run. Atop the hillside were a \\"coalhouse\\", \\"orehouse\\", and \\"screenhouse\\"; three large warehouses (about 100' x 50' each) with railroad trestles running into them for the delivery and storage of raw materials. Their elevated position allowed charcoal and ore to be moved directly to a crusher house and a charging house on the edge of the hillside; the mixed coal and ore could then move across a charging bridge into the top of the furnace stack, whose base was at the foot of the hill. Attached to the base of the furnace were a \\"wheel house\\", apparently used for storing casting sand and fire brick, and a casting house where molten iron from the furnace could run into molds. Just to the northwest lay the boiler shed and blowing engine for the furnace's steam-powered tuyeres, and several ancillary buildings also lay in the floodplain on both sides of Perkins Run. Current aerial photography shows the coalhouse, casting and crushing houses, blowing engine house, and a small storage building have been reroofed and appear to form part of a private residence. The furnace stack appears to be largely demolished, and other buildings are gone; the foundations and lower walls of the orehouse and screenhouse are still evident.

After the Miyazaki Prefectural Railway was nationalized on 21 September 1917, Japanese Government Railways (JGR) undertook the subsequent extension of the track which it designated as the Miyazaki Main Line. Expanding north in phases, the track reached Ichitana which was established as the northern terminus on 1 July 1923. At the same time, JGR had been expanding its Hosh≈´ Line south from down the east coast of Kyushu, reaching its southern terminus of just 9 km north of Ichitana by March 1922. The link up between the two lines was achieved on 15 December 1923, through-traffic was thus established from Kokura through Ichitana to . The entire stretch of track was then renamed the Nipp≈ç Main Line. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, the station came under the control of JR Kyushu.

They were synthesized via structural modifications to glibenclamide, an antidiabetic drug. Both HMR 1883 and glibenclamide act by inactivating the ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) responsible for potassium efflux.Billman, G. E., Englert, H. C., & Schoelkens, B. A.

HMR 1098 is not an SUR isotype specific inhibitor of heterologous or sarcolemmal KATP channels. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 50(3):552-560  Mechanism  Hypoxia provokes potassium efflux from cardiac muscles cells via the activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP).Wilde, A. A. M. (1993). Role of ATP-sensitive K+ channel current in ischemic arrhythmias. Cardiovasc Drugs Ther 7, 521‚àí526. Potassium efflux from cardiac cells decreases action potential duration and results in non-uniform repolarization of the cardiac cells.Harris, A. S., Bisteni, A., Russell, R. A., Brigham, J. C., & Firestone, J. E. (1954). Excitory factors in ventricular tachycardia resulting from myocardial ischemia: potassium a major excitant. Science 119, 200‚àí203 The heterogeneous repolarization of the cardiac tissue permits reentry of action potentials into conducting pathways, which manifests as malignant arrhythmias in the heart. HMR 1883 is a cardioselective ATP- sensitive potassium channel antagonist that prevents the potassium efflux, hence corrects the non-uniform refractory period in the ischemic tissue. A uniform refractory period corrects the conductance problems in the heart and prevents the re-entry arrhythmias.  Side effects  HMR 1883 attenuates ischemically induced arrhythmias with little to no side effects as a result of having a higher affinity for the cardiac tissue KATP subtype than any other subtype found in the body. In contrast, glibenclamide interacts with many KATP channels throughout the body resulting in many side effects. In particular its interaction with coronary smooth muscle cells and pancreatic-Œ≤ cells cause decreased coronary blood flow, hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. Since KATP channels only become activated during periods of low ATP and High ADP, HMR 1883 only affects hypoxic tissue and has no negative effect on the normal tissue. Activation of the KATP channels on cardiac mitochondria is involved in ischemic preconditioning that results in protection for the heart.Gross, G. J., & Fryer, R. M. (1999). Sarcolemmal versus mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channels and myocardial preconditioning. Circ Res 84, 973‚àí979.

Phoenix is known for helping to save Marina District buildings from further destruction by fire following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Her worthy assistance resulted in a second vintage fireboat obtained for the city. Both Guardian and Phoenix are based at Firehouse No. 35 at Pier 22¬Ω of the Port of San Francisco. Phoenix often leads parades of ships, and takes part in welcoming ceremonies. Phoenix at Pier 22¬Ω History The city of San Francisco operated two fireboats in the 1900s: Governor Irwin and Governor Markham. Both were capable of pumping about per minute. These two, assisted by tugboats and military fireboats, tried but failed to stop the horrific fires which swept the city after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In 1909, two new fireboats were placed in service‚ÄîDavid Scannell and Dennis T. Sullivan‚Äîsteam-powered boats each rated for per minute. A firehouse was built for them at the edge of the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in 1915. This firehouse was moved by barge to Pier 22¬Ω near the intersection of Harrison Street and Embarcadero following the Exposition, when the old fair buildings were being torn down and the Marina District was being built in its place. The two fireboats served the city for 45 years and were scrapped in 1954. To fill the anticipated lack of a fireboat, Phoenix was built in 1954 in Alameda by Hugh F. Munroe of Plant Shipyard, paid for by the State of California. Her name came from a contest publicized by the Port Authority; the winning suggestion was submitted by a member of the Phoenix Society, a group of San Francisco citizens interested in civil fire protection. Phoenix, the mythical firebird which rose anew from ashes, seemed appropriate because the city of San Francisco had risen seven times from great fires. Phoenix is long with a beam and a draft. Phoenix can pump up to at a pressure of , or at the rate of per minute at twice the pressure. She can make . When put into service in 1955, Phoenix was the only fireboat based in San Francisco. Like her predecessors, she docked at Pier 22¬Ω; one of only two remaining 1915 Exposition buildings, the other being the Palace of Fine Arts. Two decades later, Phoenix was the subject of discussions about the city budget. In the late 1970s, the fireboat's annual operating expenses were about $1.2 million. Mayor George Moscone met with the San Francisco Port Commission in 1977 to determine whether Phoenix would be refurbished, replaced, or scrapped with no replacement. An improvement bond was passed in November 1977 to build a new fireboat. Local naval architects Morris Guralnick Associates submitted a design in 1980 to replace Phoenix, but the estimated construction costs far exceeded the bond. Instead, Mayor Dianne Feinstein redirected the funds to refurbish Phoenix in 1981‚Äì1982. Firefighting Phoenixs first call to action came on April 2, 1955. A four- alarm blaze at the Ferry Building greatly damaged the north end of the building; losses came to $750,000. Other notable fires that Phoenix fought include Pier 70 burning in 1980, and a lengthy battle at Piers 30‚Äì32 throughout the night of May 9‚Äì10, 1984‚Äîa five-alarm explosive conflagration which destroyed the piers and caused an estimated $2.5 million in damage. Local shipping accidents are among the responsibilities of the Phoenix. In September 1965, the Norwegian freighter MS Berganger collided with the tanker Independent, resulting in fires aboard the ships. Phoenix responded along with U.S. Coast Guard fireboats to quickly put out the freighter's blaze, but the tanker took longer to extinguish. A year later, a gasoline barge collided with rocks near the shore. While Phoenix and the Coast Guard were investigating, the barge exploded killing two Coast Guardsmen and one nearby workman. Phoenix rescued a third Coast Guardsman with severe injuries, and fought to snuff the blaze. Flaming, floating gasoline proved difficult to subdue. In December 2011, a tourist DUKW boat suffered an engine fire while in McCovey Cove, and Phoenix doused the flames while the Coast Guard rescued the passengers and crew. =1989 Marina District fires= Phoenix played a notable role in the response to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. At 5:04 pm on October 17, 1989, a major earthquake rumbled through the San Francisco Bay Area. One of the hardest-hit locations was the Marina District of San Francisco; a densely populated neighborhood built up primarily in the 1920s on rubble, sand and debris dumped at the edge of the bay following the 1906 earthquake. A number of buildings collapsed, and firefighters were called to rescue trapped residents. Subsequent to a sharp aftershock,Postel, 1990, p. 3 a fire broke out in a three-story building at Divisadero and Jefferson, threatening nearby buildings. Fire engines connected their hoses to the city's seawater-based Auxiliary Water Supply System (AWSS) and began to quench the fire, but an explosion caused the structure to collapse onto the fire hydrant. Fire crews were forced back, and with the assistance of off-duty police and civilian volunteers they ran hoses four blocks away to alternate sources. Further explosions caused other structures to collapse onto the newly laid hoses. At about the same time, other fire companies in the Marina were reporting water pressure problems with both the AWSS and the regular municipal water system. The AWSS was suffering from broken underground lines and from a 20% loss in stored water volume‚Äîboth from earthquake damage‚Äîand from broken high pressure hydrants caused by building collapses.Postel, 1990, p. 1 At 6:16 pm Phoenix was called to assist.Postel, 1990, p. 4 At 6:49 pm fire crews waiting to connect to Phoenix reported she was having difficulty getting close enough because of low tide conditions.Postel, 1990, p. 5 Despite the problems requiring pilot and commander Arvid Havneras to perform an extraordinarily hazardous docking procedure, at 7:00 pm Phoenix was ready to pump at the Marina lagoon, two blocks away from the first fire. By this time the whole neighborhood was threatened with destruction by fire. Fire crews were manning hoses laid in anticipation; firefighters at the burning buildings were instructed to hold their ground, that they would soon have more water. Phoenix connected hoses to an engine company and to two ladder trucks and commenced pumping seawater from the bay. Fire crews renewed their efforts, making a frontal attack on burning structures. Soon, one of the Fire Department's Hose Tenders arrived in the lagoon carrying of hose, followed shortly by another hose tender‚Äîthey connected to Phoenix to relay water to more distant engine companies. In a parallel effort, the AWSS lines were inspected by city workers, temporary repairs made, and two high-pressure pump stations were brought back into operation at about 8 pm, supplying 10,000 U.S. gallons per minute. Phoenix worked until all the Marina fires were under control, pumping seawater continuously for 15 hours at the rate of 6,400 gallons per minute, a total of 5.5 million gallons (20.8 ML). Phoenix is credited with saving the area from further destruction. One of Feinstein's last mayoral acts was to save the city's only fireboat from suggested budget cuts. Some 21 months later the earthquake struck. Feinstein wrote that the boat \\"unquestionably saved the Marina from a greater catastrophe\\". The fireboat's role in the earthquake is the subject of a children's book, Frankie & The Phoenix. Senator Feinstein read the book to students at the opening of a new San Francisco elementary school dedicated in her name in August 2006. Subsequent to the 1989 earthquake, $50,000 from grateful Marina property owners, and $300,000 from an anonymous donor were used to provide Phoenix with a colleague. Guardian, an older fireboat built in 1951, was purchased from the City of Vancouver, British Columbia, and refurbished. She was piloted down the Pacific Coast to dock alongside Phoenix at Pier 22¬Ω. In 1999, the shared fireboat house was declared San Francisco's 225th Historic Landmark. A planned monument to the 1989 earthquake, the Marina Earthquake Memorial, focuses on the role of Phoenix in the Marina firefighting effort and will incorporate the original 16-foot-high (5 m) tower monitor from Phoenix as a centerpiece of the memorial design. Ceremonial appearances Phoenix leads a parade of ships during Fleet Week, October 2007 Phoenix has taken a lead role in many spectacles on the San Francisco Bay. The fireboat regularly leads parades on the bay, escorts famous ships entering the bay, and participates in tall ship events and Fleet Week in San Francisco. Phoenix threw out plumes of water to celebrate the reopening of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge on November 16, 1989 following its closure due to earthquake damage. Phoenix welcomed the historic cruise vessel SS Independence to San Francisco in November 2001. In July 2005, Phoenix led the \\"Parade of Sail\\" from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Bay Bridge. Famous tall ships in the parade included the barque ARM Cuauht√©moc from Mexico and the Pallada from Russia. Other ships included the Liberty ship SS Jeremiah O'Brien and the presidential yacht USS Potomac‚Äîboth based in San Francisco Bay. In 2008, Phoenix led a similar parade including Californian (California's official tall ship, based in San Diego) and the Coast Guard barque the Eagle. The Jeremiah O'Brien took part as did the U.S. Navy submarine Pampanito. Crew and maintenance Phoenix is normally operated with a crew of one vessel command Fireboat officer, one engineer who operates the pumps and engines, one pilot who steers/navigates the boat, one fire Engine company officer, and three to five firefighters to handle hoses and nozzles. Firehouse 35 on Pier 22¬Ω has seven men on duty at all times: four to serve Engine #35, and three dedicated to the two fireboats. All seven are able to man the fireboats in an emergency. As many as ten men can work Phoenix, but in October 1989 after Engine #35 was called to duty, only three were available: Pilot Arvid Havneras, Engineer Nate Hardy, and Lieutenant Bob Banchero. Both fireboat pilot and engineer are licensed by the US Coast Guard. In the early 2000s, San Francisco spent $1.7 million each year to operate its two fireboats. Maintenance problems on the historic vessels increased to the point that Phoenix needed to be lifted into dry dock for extensive repairs to the hull. The fireboat was thoroughly renovated in 2004 at Bayside Boatworks in Sausalito, California.

Mac Firbis uniquely describes the Bissetts as being of Greek origin, first arriving in England with William the Conqueror.Hill, p. 23 As far as Margery's likely mother Sabia it is possible she was one of the four daughters of Aodh Reamhar √ì N√©ill, King of Ulster, whose names were unknown to the 19th century genealogist John O'Hart,O'Hart, p. 718 the O'Neill pedigrees themselves being imperfectly preserved. Life Possibly some time before, or around the time of her marriage to John M√≥r Tanister, Margery met Richard II of England when he was in Ireland, either during his 1394‚Äì1395 campaign to receive the submission of a number of the Irish princes, or later in 1399, the year in which he was deposed. She was \\"no doubt presented to him, as the daughter of a great northern lord\\", and retained a memory of his face.Hill, p. 26 After she had come to reside with John in the Isles, the contemporary Scottish poet Andrew of Wyntoun tells of her recognition of a man whom she believed to be the deposed king travelling [dressed] as a poor man.Hill, p. 25 Although Richard is widely believed to have starved to death in captivity in Pontefract Castle in early 1400, Margery vouched for the man, whomever he may have been, and the Scots believed her. He was naturally dismissed as an impostor by Henry IV, but had a kind of career as an anti-Lancastrian figurehead anyway and died in 1419.

Plot As described in a film magazine, scientist Dr. Gregory Sinclair (Connelly) and his fellow explorers find a man, Howard Hillary (Houdini), frozen in solid arctic ice and chop him out and then thaw him. When he returns to life, Dr. Sinclair does not tell Howard that he is 100 years behind the times, planning to study his reactions after they return to civilization. Howard tells that he loved Felice, the daughter of the caption of a ship, and there was a mutiny. In his last memory of the event, Howard was trying to save the young woman's father when he received a blow to the head. Dr. Sinclair persuades Howard not to search the snow and ice of the arctic, but to return to civilization. When Dr. Sinclair returns home, he learns that his ward's father, Dr. Crawford Strange, had set out to join him in the arctic but was lost. It is the wedding day of his ward. When Howard sees the bride, he calls out to her, calling her \\"Felice\\" and begging her to recall their love. The ward's name is Felice Strange (Connelly) and she is the reincarnation of Howard's lost sweetheart. The wedding is postponed indefinitely, and Felice begs Howard to help find her missing father. The discarded suitor, Dr. Gilbert Trent (Maude), has kidnapped her father Dr. Strange and is holding him in the cellar of his house, having planned to marry Felice and having her go with him to hunt for her father in the arctic. Howard and Dr. Sinclair stumble upon a clue, a hat with a cloth in it with Dr. Strange's initials, which leads them to rescuing him. Felice is being pursued by a hireling of Dr. Trent, and Howard follows them to the edge of the Niagara rapids. Howard swims the rapids, catches up with the canoe, and saves the young woman. Howard and Dr. Trent battle on the cliff and Trent goes over. Felice recognizes in Howard her true mate for their belated romance.

As was his habit, Houdini performed all of his own stunts.  Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle  The Man from Beyond is in some ways Houdini's attempt to reconcile with his erstwhile friend, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Houdini befriended the English author while performing in Britain in 1920, but the two publicly disagreed about the legitimacy of spiritualism (Doyle was a fervent advocate of the supernatural while Houdini was its most famous critic). The pair had a falling out when they attended a seance in which the \\"spirit\\" of Houdini's mother (who had only spoken and understood German while alive) communicated to her son in English. By 1922, the men were no longer talking because Doyle refused to accept Houdini's criticisms of the event. The Man from Beyond ends with the words \\"You must believe\\" and the spirit of the vintage-1820 Felice entering the body of the 1922 model, a replication of the cover of Doyle's 1918 spiritual treatise, The New Revelation. Doyle praised the film and wrote: > From the opening scene showing the actual chopping of a frozen man from the > center of a mass of ice and restoring him to life, to the closing scenes of > the sensational rescue of the girl from the very brink of Falls, it holds > one breathless. I consider The Man from Beyond one of the really great > contributions to the screen. The film's publicity campaign subsequently used Doyle's quote in advertisements.

S. (2001). Psychology in Organizations. London, SAGE Publications.Turner, J. C., Oakes, P. J. (1997). The socially structured mind. In C. McGarty & S. A. Haslam (Eds.), The message of social psychology: Perspectives on mind in society (pp. 355-373). Oxford: Blackwell.Postmes, T. & Branscombe, N. (2010). Sources of social identity. In T. Postmes & N. Branscombe (Eds). Rediscovering Social Identity: Core Sources. Psychology Press. The social identity approach has been applied to a wide variety of fields and continues to be very influential. There is a high citation rate for key social identity papers and that rate continues to increase. Aspects Figure 1. The explanatory profiles of social identity and self-categorization theories.The term \\"social identity approach\\" arose as an attempt to mitigate against the tendency to conflate the two theories, as well as the tendency to mistakenly believe one theory to be a component of the other. These theories should be thought of as overlapping in the manner demonstrated in Fig 1. While there are similarities, self categorisation theory has greater explanatory scope (i.e. is less focused on intergroup relationships specifically) and has been investigated in a broader range of empirical conditions. Self-categorization theory can also be thought of as developed to address limitations of social identity theory. Specifically the limited manner in which social identity theory deals with the cognitive processes that underpin the behaviour it describes. Although this term may be useful when contrasting broad social psychological movements, when applying either theory it is thought of as beneficial to distinguish carefully between the two theories in such a way that their specific characteristics can be retained. Implications =Social groups= The social identity approach has been contrasted with the social cohesion approach when it comes to defining social groups. The social identity approach describes the state of people thinking of themselves and others as a group. Therefore, three intrapsychological processes proceed. Firstly, social categorization (see self-categorization theory) means that people organize social information by categorizing people into groups. Secondly, social comparison (see social comparison theory) means that people give a meaning to those categories in order to understand the task of the group in the specific situation. Thirdly, social identification is the process in which people relate the self to one of those categories. Regarding the relation between collective identification and work motivation, several propositions have been made regarding situational influences, the acceptance of the leader and the self-definition of a collective. As a situational influence, research says that individuals are activated by situations that challenge their inclusion to the group. The acceptance of the leader is another proposition. The so-called ingroup- favoring-bias (see in-group favoritism) means that if the team leader is interpreted as an ingroup member, the other team members will attribute his or her good behavior internally while they will attribute bad behavior externally. For self-definition of a collective the value of the group as well as the belief in current and future success is important. Closely linked to self-definition to a collective, cohesion is another construct that has an impact on the development of group motivation and in a broader sense also to the group performance. On the topic of social groups, some social psychologists draw a distinction between different types of group phenomenon. Specifically, \\"those that derive from interpersonal relationships and interdependence with specific others and those that derive from membership in larger, more impersonal collectives or social categories\\". The social identity approach however does not anticipate this distinction. Instead it anticipates that the same psychological processes underlie intergroup and intragroup phenomenon involving both small and large groups. Relatedly, the persistent perception that the social identity approach is only relevant to large group phenomenon has led some social identity theorists to specifically reassert (both theoretically and empirically) the relevance of the social identity approach to small group interactions. Applications =Leadership= According to the social identity approach, leadership is a function of the group instead of the individual. Individuals who are leaders in their groups tend to be closer to the prototypical group member than are followers. Additionally, they tend to be more socially attractive, which makes it easier for group members to accept their authority and comply with their decisions. Finally, leaders tend to be viewed by others as the leader. In this final distinction, group members attribute leadership traits to the person and not the situation, furthering the distinction between the leader and others in the group by viewing him or her as special. Consistent with this view of leadership, researchers have found that individuals can manipulate their own leadership status in groups by portraying themselves as prototypical to the group. =Economics= Social identity concepts have been applied to economics resulting in what is now known as identity economics.Garai, Laszlo: Identity EconomicsAkerlof, George A., and Rachel E. Kranton (2010). Identity Economics: How Our Identities Shape Our Work, Wages, and Well-Being, Princeton University Press, \\"Introduction,\\" pp. 3‚Äì8, and preview. For example, two separate papers and a book by Akerlof and Kranton incorporate social identity as a factor in the principal‚Äìagent model. The main conclusion is that when agents consider themselves insiders, they will maximize their identity utility by exerting greater effort compared to the prescription behavior. On the other hand, if they consider themselves outsiders, they will require a higher wage to compensate their loss for behavior difference with prescribed behaviors. Related theoretical work =Social identity model of deindividuation effects= The social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE) was developed from further research on the social identity theory and the self- categorization theory, further specifying the effects of situational factors on the functioning of processes proposed by the two theories. The SIDE model uses this framework to explain cognitive effects of visibility and anonymity in intra-group and inter-group contexts. The model is based on the idea that the self-concept is flexible and different in different situations or contexts. The theory consists of a range of different self-categories that define people as unique individuals or in terms of their membership to specific social groups and other, broader social categories based on the context of the situation. The SIDE model proposes that anonymity shifts both the focus of self-awareness from the individual self to the group self and the perceptions of others from being mostly interpersonal to being group-based (stereotyping). Research has suggested that visual anonymity not only increases negative behavior towards others, but can also promote positive social relations. In one study, all volunteers participated individually in group discussion based on three different topics. In the visually anonymous condition, all communications between participants were text-based while in the visually identifiable condition, the communication was also supplemented by two-way video cameras. The study resulted in the findings that showed anonymity significantly increased group attraction. =Intergroup emotion theory= Intergroup emotion theory further expands on the concept of personally significant group memberships as posed by social identity and self- categorization theories. This theory is primarily based on the concept of depersonalization and the interchangeability of the self with other ingroup members. This causes cognitive representations of the self and the group to become inevitably connected, and therefore the group obtains an emotional significance. This means that individuals not only categorize themselves as members of the ingroup but also \\"react emotionally when situations or events affect the ingroup\\". For example, people often report that their group is being discriminated against, even though they feel that they personally are not subject to that discrimination. Controversies =Social identity vs. interdependence= Some researchers have claimed that the majority of results in research using the minimal group paradigm can be derived from self-interest and interdependence and that this poses a serious problem for social identity theory and self-categorization theory, and in particular self-categorization theory's account of social groups. Social identity researchers have responded by suggesting that the interdependence centric analysis that has been proposed as an alternative is inconsistent and still relies heavily on the social categorization processes detailed in self-categorization theory. Moreover, they argue that researchers making the above criticisms have also significantly misinterpreted the role of sociological categories in the two theories.

She is best known for a minor hit folk song ‚ÄúI Love Onions‚Äù (1966) and for her critically acclaimed solo psychedelic-folk album Paint A Lady (2006). Early career A gifted child, Susan Christie met music producer and director John Hill while the two were involved in a junior-high play. Most of her future music was produced in collaboration with Hill, with whom she was also romantically involved. Following high school, the two studied together at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. During this time, they came to the attention of Cameo-Parkway record producer Dave Appell, which inspired both Christie and Hill to begin seriously pursuing music as a career. Their first collaboration was a folk group called The Highlanders, who performed live at various folk festivals during the mid 1960s. Although Susan Christie is not credited as a songwriter, several songs were written specifically with her in mind, most notably by John Hill, David Cochrane, and Bill Soden. In 1966, Christie and Hill recorded two folk-pop songs, ‚ÄúWhen Love Comes‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo One Can Hear You Cry‚Äù which they unsuccessfully tried selling to various record labels. The songs were eventually released through the Chante label as a single but failed to chart, and were subsequently pushed aside in favor of new projects. Some forty years later they were included as the final two tracks on the album Paint A Lady, where they earned much critical praise. I Love Onions Susan Christie's first taste of success came with the release of the novelty-folk song ‚ÄúI Love Onions‚Äù on April 11, 1966. The song, written by John Hill and David Cochrane, cost the couple $700 to produce and was picked up by Columbia Records. Described as having a catchy, quirky sound reminiscent of the 1920s, Christie's breathy vocals are featured with a chorus of kazoo, harmonica, and backup singers. The last verse is recited in an Elmer Fudd type of voice. The song was well received, but only peaked at #63 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Released internationally, ‚ÄúI Love Onions‚Äù charted highest in Canada, where it came in at #19 on the RPM 100 national singles on August 1, 1966. It was featured in episodes of Captain Kangaroo, and later adapted for several television ads, including a 1980 Turtles Chocolate commercial. The original single of ‚ÄúI Love Onions‚Äù features a second Hill - Cochrane song, ‚ÄúTake Me As You Find Me‚Äù on the b-side. Paint A Lady Following the success of ‚ÄúI Love Onions‚Äù, Susan Christie and John Hill attempted to market two more pop-novelty singles through Columbia Records: ‚ÄúTonight You Belong To Me‚Äù with b-side ‚ÄúToy Balloon‚Äù released April 24, 1967 and ‚ÄúAll I Have To Do Is Dream‚Äù paired with b-side ‚ÄúAnywhere You Are‚Äù, released October 17, 1967. Unfortunately, neither single made the charts, and Christie was also growing tired of the breathy pop style she was becoming associated with. Bootlegs and vinyl rips of these songs circulated the internet for years before they finally received an official re-release as part of the Columbia Singles album on March 16, 2018. Their success started to turn around however, when the pair were offered an album deal through ABC-Paramount. ‚ÄúThis wonderful opportunity came for us to do things the way we would like to do them,‚Äù Christie would later say. They carefully selected a mixture of country, folk, and psychedelic songs and created unique, original renditions of each for an album to be released under the title Paint a Lady. But after the first few tracks were completed, ABC-Paramount pulled the deal, declaring the album to be un- commercial. Only three privately pressed vanity copies were produced (circa 1970 - 1971) which the disappointed couple saved along with the master tapes. Following the failure to complete Paint A Lady, Christie abandoned her dreams of recording as an independent artist, working instead as a jingle singer and focusing on personal and family life. ‚ÄúI had decided against being a normal singer because jingle work was easier to fit around the children. I sang about bladder control, detergents, Diet Pepsi and Maxwell House coffee,‚Äù she said during a 2008 interview. Paint A Lady languished in all but forgotten obscurity in Christie's basement until, in the early 2000s, she was approached by a record company executive named Keith D‚ÄôArcy who specialized in rare and unusual recordings. She gave him one of the three copies, which he then shared with English DJ Andy Votel, owner and founder of Finders Keepers Records. The album was released commercially for the first time in 2006 to great acclaim. The title track ‚ÄúPaint A Lady‚Äù was also released as a single for the Finders Keepers Records Compacta Series, including ‚ÄúGhost Riders In The Sky‚Äù (which Susan Christie considered her finest recorded track) as a b-side. Finders Keepers Records described the album as a ‚Äúpsychedelic take on country standards and hand crafted tales of inner-city solitude backed by a break heavy folk funk rhythm section‚Äù. Spin Magazine described it as filled with ‚Äúbrilliantly original songs\\" and Christie's voice as a \\"dark, strange songbird‚Äù. Christie herself summed the album up simply: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd always been proud of it - it was a new sound, sort of ‚Äòfunky-folk‚Äô.‚Äù Later success Following the warm reception to Paint A Lady, Andy Votel and his wife, recording artist Jane Weaver, organized a live concert dubbed The Lost Ladies Of Folk which headlined Susan Christie along with artists Bonnie Dobson and Wendy Flower. Lost Ladies Of Folk took place on Saturday, June 23rd, 2007 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, England. Christie‚Äôs son appeared on stage with her, providing backup instrumentals. The concert represents Susan Christie‚Äôs only live performance as a solo artist. She has since been included in several compilation albums, including Bearded Ladies available through Finders Keepers Records. In 2009, Christie was featured as a guest artist on John Hill‚Äôs album The Six Moons Of Jupiter, providing spoken word vocals, and in 2010 she appeared on Jane Weaver‚Äôs album The Fallen By Watch Bird. Original copies of her singles are highly coveted by collectors, while CD and LP copies of Paint A Lady have become increasingly sought after on internet auction and music sites since it was first released in 2006. Finders Keepers Records released a remastered edition of Paint A Lady in February 2019.

Unique to this species is its mating ritual, where males attempt to inseminate eggs in the nests of other males. This phenomenon can be explained with condition dependent mating decisions.

It is in remembrance of 13 people shot by the West Bengal Police in Kolkata, during a rally by the West Bengal Youth Congress under Mamata Bandopadhyay on 21 July 1993, while demanding Voter's Identity Card to be made sole required document for voting.  Background  In months preceding the events, the 14-year-old communist government won a massive mandate in 1991, but after Mamata Bandopadhyay became the president of youth wing of the opposition INC a new wave of protests began against what many believed Scientific Rigging employed by the. On October 1992, Banerjee, now a Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs in the Narsimha Rao ministry held a massive rally at the Brigade Parade Ground to symbolically toll the bell for ousting of the Communist Government. To many this rejuvenated the opposition to Ruling Communists after a long gap. On December 1992, Banerjee took a physically challenged Girl Felani Basak, who was allegedly raped by CPI(M) cadres to the Writers' Building to the then Chief Minister Jyoti Basu but was harassed and allegedly molested by the police before being arrested and released from detention in midnight, this attracted universal outrage. Finally the youth wing of the party led by Mamata Banerjee, Pankaj Banerjee, Madan Mitra decided to march to Writers' Building to lodge appeals for Voter Photo-ID cards to be made necessary for free and fair polling....  Events that day  It was July 21, 1993. The day of Writers' Abhijan organised by the Youth Congress. The demand was: voters' ID cards be made the only required document for voting, to put a stop to CPM's \\"scientific rigging\\". Thousands of Youth Congress supporters had gathered at five different points of the city, recalled Trinamool Congress leader Saugata Roy. A large number of Youth Congress supporters who had assembled at Howrah station, were marching along Brabourne Road. A strong police contingent stopped them near the Tea Board office ‚Äîa stone's throw from Writers'. As the crowd tried to break the police cordon, a lathicharge ensued. Stones were thrown, tear gas shells were burst. The crowd retreated, but did not disperse. They took shelter in the narrower roads and lanes between the Tea Board and the Canning Street crossings. Lathi-wielding policemen entered the lanes to chase them away. Suddenly a policeman emerged from one of the lanes, bleeding profusely from the head ‚Äî his white uniform smeared in blood. He had evidently been hit by a stone in the head. Seeing him in that condition, the cops went berserk. By that time, state Youth Congress president Mamata Banerjee had reached the Tea Board crossing, accompanied by a few other leaders. She had climbed onto a traffic post in the middle of the road, in an effort to control the crowd. The angry policemen surrounded the traffic post and started a lathicharge. The Youth Congress leaders accompanying Mamata threw a protective ring around her. Some of them ‚Äî including Saugata Roy ‚Äî were badly beaten up. It had been planned that supporters would move towards Writers' Buildings from different directions and lay a siege on the state secretariat. Mamata had, in the meantime, demonstrated her crowd-pulling ability by holding a successful Youth Congress rally at the Brigade Parade Ground. But the no-nonsense chief minister Jyoti Basu had already announced that he would not allow the state secretariat to be taken over by the YC brigade. But as planned by the YC, rallies were heading towards Writers' from different directions ‚Äî from Brabourne Road, from BB Ganguly Street, from Mission Row. One procession was approaching from Mayo Road, where gatherings are prohibited under Section 144. It was stopped by police at the crossing of Mayo Road and Red Road. A scuffle ensued. A few people started throwing stones. Police resorted to lathicharge. The crowd started running across Curzon Park and the battle spread. Afraid that they would be outnumbered, policemen opened fire. Thirteen people were shot dead. \\"Mamata herself was beaten up. She collapsed on the road. We rushed her to hospital. More than 200 youths were injured,\\" said Saugata Roy.  21 July rally history 1998-present  After the main organizers of the 1993 rally broke away to form All India Trinamool Congress the mantle of the rally was taken by AITMC.Trinamool rally chokes large parts of Kolkata - Times Of India 2009 and 2010 events drew 2-3 million people each. in 2011 the count was close to 3.5 million.

In fact, two co- operative companies opened cheese and butter factories in Victoria in 1888; the first to open, on 22 October, was the Cobden and District Cheese and Butter Factory Company Ltd, and then on 14 November the Warrnambool Cheese & Butter Factory Co. Ltd. opened their factory in Allansford. At the start, the main product was cream, which was taken to Melbourne by rail. However, butter production expanded during the 1890s, and by 1900, Victoria had 304 butter factories. Initially, Warrnambool Cheese & Butter Factory sourced their milk from local farmers, and in 1889 all suppliers became shareholders.

Their classification is uncertain, but they are generally treated as a group of maxillopod crustaceans. Description Cycloids have a \\"striking\\" resemblance to crabs, and are thought to have inhabited a similar ecological niche, and to have been driven to extinction when crabs became widespread and diverse. The largest members are over across the carapace. Their gills are often preserved in three dimensions, and do not resemble those of other crustaceans. Cycloid taxa differ in the number of walking legs, in the form of the mouthparts and in other significant ways. Affinities There is considerable debate about the placement of cycloids within the Arthropoda. While they are generally considered to be crustaceans of some kind, doubts have been expressed about the homology of cycloids' respiratory structures with those of other crustaceans, and parallels drawn instead with chelicerates. The first description of a cycloid was in the 1836 treatise Illustrations of the Geology of Yorkshire by John Phillips, where Phillips described \\"Agnostus ? radialis\\" among the trilobites, with the text \\"ribs radiating, with acute puncta; abdomen mucronate\\". In 1838, Hermann von Meyer described a species of trilobite, albeit in the genus Limulus, and later transferred it to a new genus, Halicyne, recognising that it was something different. In 1841, Laurent-Guillaume de Koninck transferred Phillips' species to a new genus, Cyclus, away from the trilobites, although he later described a second species of Cyclus which was later recognised as the hypostome of a trilobite. Cycloids were later considered to be members of the Xiphosura, true crabs, and branchiurans. In an unpublished dissertation, Neil D. L. Clark proposed in 1989 that cycloids were copepods. In 1997, Frederick Schram and his co-authors classified them as the sister group to copepods, within the Maxillopoda, and in 2008, Jerzy Dzik placed them as an order within the maxillopod suborder Branchiura, which previously contained only the modern fish lice. Taxa and stratigraphy Cycloids are known from deposits ranging from Carboniferous (Cyclus spp.) to Maastrichtian (Maastrichtocaris rostrata). They are one of only three groups of \\"generally Palaeozoic\\" arthropods to survive the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event, the others being the freshwater-living Euthycarcinoida and the marine Thylacocephala. The order Cyclida contains 15 genera. In approximate age order, they are: *Cyclus contains a number of species found in Carboniferous deposits. *Schramine comprises three species formerly included in Halicyne of mid to late Carboniferous age. *Americlus contains several species from the Carboniferous, including A. americanus (formerly Cyclus americanus), a well known species from Mazon Creek. *Apionicon apioides is found in Pennsylvanian shales in Illinois, including Mazon Creek. *Hemitrochiscus paradoxus is found in Permian dolomite near W√ºnschendorf/Elster (Germany). *Oonocarcinus insignis and Paraprosopon reussi are found in the Permian limestones of the Sosio valley on Sicily (Italy). *Halicyne contains several species from the Triassic. *Carcinaspides pustulosus is found in limestone rocks in the Isar valley of Bavaria (Germany) and is probably of Mid to Late Triassic age. *Opolanka decorosa is found in Late Triassic rocks at Krasiej√≥w in Poland. *Cyclocarcinoides serratus and Mesoprosopon triasinum are found in the grey Norian (late Triassic) limestones of Bad Ischl in the Austrian Salzkammergut. *Juracyclus posidoniae is found in the Jurassic ' near T√ºbingen, southern Germany. *Alsasuacaris nostradamus was found in late Albian to early Cenomanian (Cretaceous) rocks near Alsasua (Navarre, Spain). *Maastrichtocaris rostrata is found in Maastrichtian (late Cretaceous) rocks from that period's type locality in the southern Netherlands. Stagmacaris quenstedti, a species from the late Kimmeridgian of southern Germany, has been reinterpreted as part of the abdomen of a hermit crab, rather than a cycloid.

Early life to 1485 A younger son of a Yorkshire family, little is known of Henry Wyatt before he adopted the cause of Henry Tudor, later to become king Henry VII. Many myths and assumptions have been woven around his privations in prison as a supporter of the Tudor party's opposition to Richard III in the years 1483‚Äì85, and are still to be found recounted as facts. Some of them occur in the widely cited entry in the Dictionary of National Biography (c.1900, available online), s.v. Sir Thomas Wyatt (poet), although the entry has since been modified by the 2004 Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. The Wyatt family papers in the British LibraryBritish Library Add MS 62135-62138, sections 62135 (2 vols), vol 2, ff. 359-369 and 456. contain material which provides the nearest that can be found to an authentic account of this period of his life. Recently transcribed and published in full, the relevant documents, although collated and written up in the 18th century, incorporate a self-contained narrative about Wyatt which can be dated to the mid 17th century. At this date the family was intent on reclaiming its former status after falling into disgrace with the execution and attainder of his grandson. The aim was to play up the glory days of Henry's adherence to the Tudor cause, describing him inter alia as ‚Äòhis Country‚Äôs martyr‚Äô.Annette Carson, ‚ÄòThe Questionable Legend of Henry Wyatt‚Äô (extended version of an article originally published in the Ricardian Register), Richard III Society, Inc., 17 February 2012 It is unknown why and in what precise capacity he came to act on behalf of the exiled Tudor, or how he came to be imprisoned. He appears to have had contacts among those close to the Scots king James III and may have been an intermediary in attempts to secure Scottish support for Henry Tudor's invasion. Possibly he fell into the hands of ‚Äòsome Scottish baron with Yorkist sympathies, only to be released when Henry VII was securely on the throne, after a considerable period of cruel imprisonment, and on the promise of a huge ransom‚Äô.Agnes Conway, Henry VII‚Äôs Relations with Scotland and Ireland, 1485‚Äì1498 (Cambridge, 1932), pp.7-8. 18th-century portrait of Henry Wyatt in prison His exploits in the Wyatt family papers include being ‚Äòimprisoned often, once in a cold and narrow Tower‚Äô, where he would have starved but for the ministrations of a kindly cat who befriended him and brought him food. During his incarceration he suffered tortures involving the use of horse-barnacles and being force-fed mustard and vinegar. On one occasion ‚Äòthe Tyrant himself examined him‚Äô, trying unsuccessfully to persuade Wyatt to change sides. Eventually in 1485 he was released from imprisonment in Scotland and received the thanks of the newly crowned Henry VII. His first recorded grant was on 11 October 1485 when he was appointed keeper of Norwich castle and gaol. A grant of Henry VIII on 22 August 1515 confirms that Wyatt still needed money to pay off his remaining Scottish ransom.Letters & Papers, Henry VIII, vol 2, 1515-18 (1864) pp. 227-388. In a surviving letterBritish Library Add MS 32379 and Egerton MS 2711. written a few months after Wyatt's death, his son Thomas wrote that God had preserved his father ‚Äòin prison from the handes of the tirant that could find in his hart to see him rakkid, from two yeres and more prisonment in Scotland in Irons and Stoks,‚Äô and from other tribulations. The myth that he was imprisoned in the Tower of London finds its first appearance in 1702 on a stone tablet in Boxley church erected by Edwin Wyatt, Henry's great-great-great-grandson. The claim is unlikely and finds no support in any records including those of the Tower of London authorities. Two reasons may account for the error. First, the association with Henry's son and grandson, each of whom was thrown into the Tower under the Tudors. The second lies in the letter's oblique reference to being racked, which may however be figurative rather than literal. Certainly the Wyatt family papers never mention the rack, as one would have expected them to, when describing the privations he suffered. The 2004 Oxford DNB states that his support for Henry Tudor began before 1483, and that he probably participated in Buckingham's Rebellion. No evidentiary support is available for either statement. The entry continues, ‚ÄòFamily legend has it that he was imprisoned and interrogated by Richard III himself.‚ÄôColin Burrow, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford, 2004) Vol. 60, s.v. Thomas Wyatt However, Richard III is never named by the Wyatt family. The assumption is derived from two instances of the word ‚Äòtyrant‚Äô applied to Wyatt's captor, a term which in the 16th century could refer to ‚ÄòAnyone who acts in a cruel, violent, or wicked manner‚Äô.Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles (OUP, 1980) More likely it referred to the Scottish baron postulated by Conway (above). Records show that Richard III never set foot in Scotland during his reign.Rhoda Edwards, The Itinerary of Richard III 1483-1485 (Richard III Society, 1983, 1995) Life under the Tudors Under Henry VII he was appointed Clerk of the Kings Jewels and Captain of Carlisle Castle. His close connections with Scotland came to the fore in his later career as Henry VII's agent in that country,S. B. Chrimes, Henry VII (1984), p. 87 note 4. for which there is ample evidence of his employment on secret and sensitive missions. He assumed high places at court, being admitted to the privy council, and remained high in the royal favour. He was one of Henry VII's executors, and one of Henry VIII's guardians. He was admitted to the privy council of the new king in April 1509, and was invested a Knight of the Bath on 23 July of the same year. In 1511 he was made, jointly with Sir Thomas Boleyn, constable of Norwich Castle and on 29 July of the same year granted the estate of Maidencote, in Berkshire. With a contingent of some 100 men he took part in the king's campaign in France in 1513, and was made knight banneret after the Battle of the Spurs, where he had served in the vanguard. In 1520 he accompanied the king to his meeting with Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, where he was responsible for the transportation of the gold and silver plate needed for the banquets. He was also present at the subsequent reception for Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor at Canterbury in 1522. He was Treasurer of the King's Chamber from 1524 to 1528. Allington Castle He purchased in 1492 Allington Castle and its estate, near Maidstone in Kent, and made the place his principal residence. Henry VIII visited him there in 1527 to meet Wolsey on his return from the continent. Wyatt remained on good terms with Sir Thomas Boleyn, who resided at Hever Castle. The proximity (about 20 miles) accounts for the meeting in a family setting of Sir Henry's poet son Thomas, and Sir Thomas's daughter Anne, the future queen, and the poetry in the courtly love tradition that resulted.Eric Ives, The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn (2005), pp.67‚Äì74.

They were once thought to be Copepods before becoming their own distinct subclass.Alan P. Covich, ... D. Christopher Rogers, in Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates (Third Edition), 2010 Branchiurans are commonly known as fish louse or fish lice if plural. Branchiurans are ectoparasites that are found primarily on fish, but can also be found on other aquatic organisms such as invertebrates and amphibians. Some species feed on the blood of their host, while others feed on mucus and extracellular material. Typically the parasites wait two to three weeks before feeding again.  Anatomy  Branchiurans are composed of an oval carapace, four pairs of swimming legs, a pair of anterior compound eyes, and an unsegmented abdomen. They are also compressed dorsoventrally and can be between two and thirty millimeters in length. In the genera Argulus, Chonopeltis, and Dipteropeltis, the adults have a pair of suction cups that are from modified first maxillae. The genus Dolops, keeps the larval stages claw-like appendages into adulthood. Also, females tend to be larger than the males. Between the genera there are multiple distinction between the sexes. For example, males in Argulus and Chonopeltis possess secondary sexual modifications on legs 2-4. The sexes both have their own sexual reproductive organs on their abdomens. The females have a spermathecae, while the males have a pair of testes.  Reproduction  While on their host, Branchiurans mate. The spermathecae on the female stores the sperm. In the genus Dolops, the males deposit a spermatophore onto the females. Once the eggs are fertilized the females leave the host organism to lay their eggs on surfaces of plants, rocks, etc. The female holds the eggs in the thorax and in some species the eggs can be found inside lobes of the carapace.

He formed the Matua sect of Hinduism.  Life  Harichand Thakur is variously said to have been born in 1811 and 1812. His family were peasant farmers of the Namasudra community and he was born in the Gopalganj area of what was then Bengal Presidency (now a part of Bangladesh). According to historian Sekhar Bandyopadhyay, Thakur \\"experienced atma darshan or self revelation, through which he realized that he was the incarnation of God himself, born in this world to bring salvation to the downtrodden\\". Thakur, whose family were Vaishnavite Hindus, founded a sect of Vaishnavite Hinduism called Matua. This was adopted by members of the Namasudra community, who were then also known by the pejorative name of Chandalas and considered to be untouchable. The sect was opposed to Brahmanical Hinduism and, according to Sipra Mukherjee \\"[inspired] the community towards education and social upliftment\\". It has subsequently attracted adherents from other caste communities that were marginalised by the upper castes, including the Chamars, Mahishyas, Malis, and Telis. Thakur's followers consider him as God (hence calling him Thakur) Harichand and as an avatar (incarnation) of Vishnu or Krishna. Thus, he became known as Sri Sri Harichand Thakur. Thakur was married to Jagat Mata Shanti Mata and they had two sons. He died at Orakandi in 1878.  Legacy  After his death, one of his sons, Guruchand Thakur (born 1846), worked with C. S. Mead in a campaign to have the Chandala people recategorised as Namasudra. According to Sekhar Bandyopadhyay, it was under the leadership of Guruchand that the Matua sect \\"achieved its doctrinal cohesion and organisational push, as it came to be associated with the Namasudra social protest movement started in 1872\\". A considerable body of Dalit literature that mixes religious and secular themes has emerged around Thakur and Matua. This includes biographies, promotions of the teachings and interpretations of the relationship to later events, such as the thoughts of B. R. Ambedkar and comparisons with the situation of black people in the US.

Biography Johannes Wieland received his early dance training under Ellys Gregor in Berlin, the ballet academy of the Deutsche Oper Berlin, with John Neumeier at the Hamburg State Opera and the Amsterdam School of the Arts where he earned his BFA. His dance career took him back to Germany, the State Theatre of Brunswick, Germany, followed by the Berlin State Opera. Here he worked with numerous guest choreographers, among them Roland Petit and Maurice B√©jart. He then joined the B√©jart Ballet Lausanne as a principal dancer and also toured extensively with the company. Ready for a radical change, Wieland next moved to New York City, where he was awarded a scholarship to the NYU Tisch School of the Arts, earning his MFA in Contemporary Dance and Choreography in 2002. His company, johannes wieland, was founded that same year and debuted with his original work tomorrow at the Joyce SoHo theater. Praised as 'a spectacular exploration of relationships', by Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times, this was one in the body of the startlingly powerful, terse strange pieces Wieland began creating for his company, prompting Dance Magazine to cite him as one of \\"25 to Watch\\" in 2003. In addition to heading his own company, Wieland is artistic director and choreographer of the resident dance company of the State Theater of Kassel in Germany. He was also associate artistic director of Paradigm in New York and is a guest choreographer and teacher in schools and companies in Europe and North America. He is a permanent resident of the United States and divides his time between New York and Germany. Work Wieland guides his dancers to achieve 'unpredictable, improbable feats and configurations' employing his riveting movement vocabulary which exhibits his architecturally driven understanding of bodies and space. The performers equally serve as conduits for the emotional atmosphere in the perilous landscape of contemporary urban life that Wieland meticulously, exhilaratingly, uninhibitedly explores in his works. The result is a richness of unconventional, explicit ideas presented with baffling technical agility and visually arresting images by his company. As part of his integrated approach to performance art, Wieland has evolved a rigorous developmental process to explore various situations of causality. This intense process fosters an intimate and innovatingly fruitful relationship between the performers, composers, designers and other collaborating artists and institutions involved in Wieland's works. Wieland's work also often incorporates video, text, photography, original sound scoring, set designs of an installation character. As part of his outreach initiative in Kassel, Wieland regularly holds open rehearsals and classes, pre- and post- performance talk-backs with the audience as well as inviting a roster of innovative choreographers to create pieces on his company.

There was a meeting (#0) with around 40 people at Upper primary school, Appapuram about the proposed Appapuram development Trust on 14 January 2012. There was a good discussion and selection of few proposed members. Trust is for those having properties / lands. As ours a charitable group with no such Assets, we proposed to register that as a Society and not as a Trust[ Appapuram Development Society ]. As development societies with place names are registered for central government, the registration of Proposed Appapuram Development Society had to be done with a different name, We have tried registering it as Yuva Chaithanya. However, only those with less than 30 years of age can be members. So we had to finally make it \\"Chaitanya Development Society, Appapuram\\" on 21 April 2012.

It is published along with Down to Earth as a supplement. The magazine was first published in May, 1998 and has widespread circulation across India and abroad. The icon of the magazine, Pandit Gobar Ganesh, the pondering panditji is an Indian elderly who takes the reader through current issues, subjects and ideas relating to the environment. He is the icon whose brains can be picked for anything on earth. The current editor of the magazine is Sorit Gupto. \\"Gobar\\" is the Hindi and Nepali word for \\"cow dung\\". It was chosen to capture the eco-philosophy and tradition of generating wealth from waste. Waste gobar serves as an insecticide and is used to plaster mud houses and is a waterproof coating for walls. It is also used to plaster floors to keep them cool. Gobar is the energy source for rural India. It is used as cooking fuel where people have no access to fuels like LPG. The greatest use of cow dung in India is in farming where it is used as natural manure for farmers' crops. In short, it's a mainstay of rural India, and an appropriate symbol for eco-friendly technology. Anil Agarwal the founder-director of Centre for Science and Environment, India‚Äôs leading environmental NGO, aptly called ‚ÄòGobar‚Äô the symbol that embodies the spirit of the Indian environmental movement. As he correctly reflected, the widespread and diverse use of gobar in Indian society stands up to every principle of good environmentalism.  History  In May 1992, the Society for Environmental Communications started India‚Äôs only science and environment fortnightly, Down To Earth (DTE). Over the years the magazine has informed and inspired people about environmental threats facing India and the world - a dimension underplayed in mainstream media. In May, 1998, Gobar Times was first published as a supplement to DTE. Gobar Times reaches out to the young, encouraging them to take the lead and make a difference. It informs them and encourages them to save the environment by becoming an action-oriented, knowledgeable and aware community. The tone of the magazine is light-hearted, simple and thought-provoking. Every month the magazine comes up with an activity related center spread which can be pulled out and put up as a poster to encourage readers to become active participants. The magazine has recently entered into a partnership with the leading newspaper Hindustan Times. Readers can now get a glimpse of what Pandit Gobar Ganesh has to say as they read HTNext.  Green Schools Program  Conceptualized by the New Delhi‚Äìbased Centre for Science and Environment(CSE), The Gobar Times Green Schools Program allows self-assessment of the environmental practices of a school by its students, using the \\"Green Schools Manual\\". This inspection or survey of environmental practices at schoolsG D Salwan Public School, Green Schools ProgramThe Rural centre is a way for them to audit their immediate environment across the key areas of water, air, land, energy and waste. *Water: To make the school water literate and teach ways of rainwater harvesting and recycling of waste water. *Air: Students check out the transport system of the school and understand how people commute to school. This further enables them to understand how transport policies affect air quality and how they can innovate and find ways of reducing emissions. *Land: The different plant and animal species on the school campus are identified by the students and a survey done on the use of pesticides in the school. Understanding the concept of carrying capacity. *Energy: The students study electricity and other forms of energy consumption on the school campus and explore ways in which it can be minimized. *Waste: Students find out how much and what type of waste the school is producing? Learn composting and waste segregation methods in the process. *Food: To make the students more conscious of the kind of food being promoted and consumed. By the end of it all the program gives the students an opportunity to give a report card to the school on its environmental performance and practices. They conduct the audit with the help of an interesting handbook called the 'Green Schools Program Manual' (2019 Edition). This manual gives them step by step guidelines on how to conduct an environmental audit in the school. The purpose of the Green Schools Program is to encourage and support schools to build up an environmentally aware, active and skilled communityOpinion, Director - NCERT of teachers, students and parents. The schools may use the manual as part of their environmental studies program or to conduct activities in eco-clubs. The data collected by students is compiled and rated such that it becomes a self- assessment tool of environmental practices followed by the school. The aim of the rating is, to understand what can be done to improve the schools performance on its environmental sustainability index and to implement measurable changes over the coming years. = Awards = The Gobar Times Green Schools Awards is a platform to acknowledge and reward schools that have adopted the most innovative and effective practices to manage natural resources within their own premises.

One is a traditional wealthy family in a comfortable apartment, whose lives are devoted to making money and meaningless socialising. The other is the underpaid and overworked domestic servants living in cramped conditions above them. As few French people want such work, the jobs are taken by Spanish women, eager to escape the poverty and oppression of Francoist Spain, who bring with them their native solidarity and human warmth.Van Hoej, Brad The Women on the Sixth Floor -Les Femmes du 6e etage Variety, 15 February 2011.

The family's French maid leaves after a dispute, so Suzanne goes to a church where the priest finds jobs for Spanish immigrants. There she hires Mar√≠a, young and pretty, who speaks French and is the niece of Concepci√≥n, the maid for another family in the same building. The apartment is a mess after days without a maid and Concepci√≥n gets some of her Spanish friends to rally round and clean it up, to the surprise and delight of Suzanne. When Suzanne wants some furniture moved up to a little room on the 6th floor that they use for storage, Jean-Louis discovers that the other little rooms there, all unheated, are occupied by Spanish maids, including their Mar√≠a. There is only one cold water tap on the landing for them to wash themselves and one Turkish toilet that is forever getting blocked. He calls a plumber to fix the toilet and says that Mar√≠a can use their own bathroom. He also lets another maid come in to use their phone for an urgent call home. Though he has been struck by Mar√≠a since first seeing her, he becomes a friend to the other women too and starts learning about Spanish language, life and culture. His wife Suzanne begins to worry, not about the maids who are mostly not young or beautiful and in any case are only servants, but about a rich client of his called Bettina de Brossolettes who is a notorious maneater. When they have a cocktail party in their flat, she is furious on finding that Bettina is invited. During the party Jean-Louis catches a hired waiter trying to kiss Mar√≠a and, furious, sacks him on the spot. Mar√≠a, furious now that Jean-Louis has openly revealed his feelings for her, accuses him of being a lecher and treats him with contempt. Meanwhile Jean-Louis has found a new post for one of the Spanish women, who invites him and all the others to a paella party. When Mar√≠a turns up, she is furious to find Jean-Louis there and enjoying himself. Arriving home late to a furious Suzanne, he is accused of having been with Bettina. He says that he was and agrees to move out. Taking over the storeroom on the 6th floor, he is not only close to Mar√≠a but becomes more closely involved in the lives of the other women on the floor. He goes to their church on Sundays, a new experience for him, and takes some of them in his car for a pilgrimage to Lisieux. Concepci√≥n is now worried that Mar√≠a will again fall for a man who will not marry her and, to stop any affair between the two, tells Mar√≠a where in Spain the son of her previous relationship now is. Mar√≠a immediately tells Suzanne she is leaving to return to Spain and, going upstairs in an emotional state, lets Jean-Louis take her into his room and kiss her. She spends the night with him and next day disappears to Spain. He is very hurt, not only because she did not tell him but also because all the other women he thought his friends were silent too. Three years later, Jean-Louis drives to Spain looking for Concepci√≥n. When he tracks her down, she claims she does not know where Mar√≠a is. However her husband, who recognises what Jean-Louis is feeling, secretly tells him. When he drives there, he sees Mar√≠a hanging out her washing and the looks that the two exchange show their love for each other.

IBM BigFix provides system administrators with remote control, patch management, software distribution, operating system deployment, network access protection and hardware and software inventory functionality.University of California IT Services: Tivoli Endpoint Manager (TEM) . Accessed 14 June 2013 History The software is the result of the integration of assets acquired from BigFix into the IBM portfolio, and extends IBM's capabilities to manage the security and compliance of servers, desktops, roaming laptops, and point-of-sale devices, such as ATMs and self-service kiosks. The software combines endpoint and security management into a single solution and enables organizations to see and manage physical and virtual endpoints. In 2019 IBM sold BigFix to HCL. =Relevance Language= The Relevance Language is a query language created by BigFix, Inc. prior to being purchased by IBM, and is used by the BigFix platform. The purpose of the relevance language is to provide an interface by which properties of a client (such as cpu, disk space, etc.) could be retrieved. The value of the relevance language is that it, to a certain extent, abstracts away platform-specific query mechanisms like WMI, /Proc, and SIM. This allows an operator to learn one query language that works across all supported platforms. In addition to cross platform compatibility, relevance is an extremely efficient query language, often responding up to hundreds of times faster than native alternatives, such as WMI. =Action Script= The Action Script language is a scripting language created by BigFix, Inc. prior to being purchased by IBM, and is used by the BigFix platform. The purpose of the action script language is to provide an interface by which changes can be made to a client. The value of the action script language is that it, to a certain extent, abstracts away platform-specific scripting differences like directory traversal, script execution and flow control. This allows an operator to learn one scripting language that works across all supported platforms. Platform components The core IBM BigFix platform can be extended using additional components delivered by IBM: IBM BigFix for Lifecycle Management includes Patch Management, Remote Control, Software Distribution, and OS Deployment. Patch Management includes patches for Microsoft, UNIX, Linux, and Macintosh operating systems. Remote Control gives you the ability to monitor and control PCs and servers. Software distribution provides a package library and automation toolkit for endpoint administrators. OS Deployment provides imaging and provisioning of operating systems as well as operating system migration capabilities. IBM BigFix for Patch Management includes vendor patches for Microsoft, UNIX, Linux, and Macintosh operating systems as well as patches for third-party applications by Adobe, Google, and Microsoft. IBM BigFix for Security and Compliance provides common STIG, CIS, and third-party security baselines, network self quarantine, and removable device control.

The three flame-shaped towers symbolize the element of fire - historically resonant in a region where natural gas flares shoot from the earth and Zoroastrian worshippers saw in fire a symbol of the divine (notably at the Ateshgah of Baku and Yanar Dag).The buildings consist of 130 residential apartments over 33 floors, a Fairmont hotel tower that consists of 250 rooms and 61 serviced apartments, and office blocks that provides a net 33,114 square meters of office space. The cost of Flame Towers was an estimated US$350 million. Construction began in 2007, with completion in 2012. HOK was the architect for the project, DIA Holdings served as the design-build contractor, and Hill International provided project management. The Flame Towers consist of three buildings: South, East and West. The facades of the three Flame Towers function as large display screens with the use of more than 10,000 high-power LED luminaires, supplied by the Osram subsidiary Traxon Technologies and Vetas Electric Lighting. On June 2014 Lamborghini opened its first branch in Azerbaijan, located on the ground floor of the East tower of the Flame Towers.  Illumination  The Flame Towers are completely covered with the LED screens that display the movement of a fire visible from the farthest points of the city. The light show transitions from giant flames, the colours of the Azeri flag, a figure waving a flag, and giant tanks of water being filled. Transition times are approximately 2 minutes.  In popular culture  The building was featured in Extreme Engineering, a documentary television series that airs on the Discovery Channel and the Science Channel. The episode called \\"Azerbaijan's Amazing Transformation\\" was broadcast on 22 April 2011 as part of Season 9. The Flame Towers also appeared prominently in trailers before many entries for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 hosted in Baku (and, in the next 4 years, with the pre song trailer based in the singer's home area, features in the trailer before the Azerbaijan song). The towers are also a prominent landmark in Battlefield 4, with the first level of the single player campaign taking place in Baku. Additionally, the towers were shown frequently during coverage of the initial Formula One European Grand Prix held in Baku.

In 2004, Westpac rebranded the Bank of Melbourne branches as Westpac branches. In 2011, Westpac resurrected the brand after rebranding its purchase of Bank of St George in Melbourne specifically and possibly in response to its initial closing of the brand. History The Bank of Melbourne was established in July 1989, following the granting of a banking licence to the RESI Statewide Building Society, with a listing on the Australian Stock Exchange following on 13 July 1989. The first chairman of the bank was Christopher Stewart, who chose Australian actor Jack Thompson to head the bank's TV advertising campaign, which ran for a decade. The bank focused operations on retail banking, with a branch network and operations focused on the state of Victoria. As a former building society, the bank was also heavily involved in lending in the residential property market. In 1996 the bank acquired the Victorian business of Challenge Bank from Westpac for A$659.7 million, making the Bank of Melbourne the fourth largest regional bank, and the eighth largest of all listed banks in Australia. By this time the Bank of Melbourne also held 9.6% of the Victorian lending market, 11.6% of the Victorian deposit market, and operated a network of 125 branches, predominantly in Melbourne. On 3 April 1997, Westpac made a $1.43 billion bid to acquire the Bank of Melbourne. At the time, Westpac had a branch network almost twice as large in Victoria as the Bank of Melbourne (212 branches), but a smaller share of the local lending and deposit markets (8.6% and 9.1% respectively). The proposal required the approval of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Treasurer of Australia; these being given by July 1997. On 29 September 1997 a vote was held for ordinary Bank of Melbourne shareholders to approve the proposal, with holders of over 96% of the shares approving the takeover. Westpac retained the rights to the Bank of Melbourne name and logos, and operated in Victoria under the Bank of Melbourne brand until January 2004, when Westpac moved all operations to a single national brand name. In 2009, speculation suggested Westpac was to relaunch the brand for a new internet- based deposit business, but with no resulting action. In July 2011, the relaunched Bank of Melbourne commenced operations as a subsidiary of Westpac & St George.

Uganda became a republic within the Commonwealth. However, the new Ugandan state was deliberately referred to as a state rather than a republic, and the constituent native kingdoms (such as Buganda) continued in existence.

Life and work Wright was born in London in 1802, the son of John Wright (d. 1820), a miniature painter of repute, acquainted with leading artists of the day such as John Hoppner, Thomas Lawrence and William Owen (1769‚Äì1825). His mother, Priscilla (n√©e Guise) was also a good miniaturist, but died when John William was still an infant in 1802. At the age of 10 he was sent to school at Loughborough House in Brixton but had to be withdrawn due to ill-health, which he suffered from throughout his life. He was apprenticed to Thomas Phillips (1770‚Äì1845), and from 1825 was a frequent exhibitor at the Royal Academy, mainly of portraits. In 1831 he was elected an associate of the Old Watercolour Society, and in 1842 a full member; in 1844 he succeeded Robert Hills (1769‚Äì1844) as secretary.The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 183 (May 1848) (John Bowyer Nichols & son). Wright painted domestic and sentimental subjects in the style then popular, and also historical compositions, notable for their detailed depictions of costumes; the plays of Shakespeare were a frequent source of inspiration.Watercolours by J W Wright on Shakespeare subjects (Folger Shakespeare Library).

Wright died at his house in Great Marlborough Street, London, on 14 January 1848, from influenza, leaving a widow and two children. The remaining works in his studio were sold by Christie & Manson in March, the same year.

The emulators available under this brand mostly cover the Digital Equipment DEC hardware platforms PDP-11, VAX, and AlphaServer, which support many of the legacy operating systems, including Tru64 and OpenVMS. The product range also includes virtualization solutions for HP 3000 using MPE/iX and SPARC. Charon software products have been developed by the Swiss software company Stromasys SA, which has its headquarters in Cointrin, near Geneva.  Products and Technology  Even today, DEC systems are frequently used in production despite their sometimes significant age. Some companies use them to support applications that are considered mission critical, for example core applications in banks and stock exchanges, air traffic control systems or manufacturing plants. The aging hardware and changing supplier availability are making the operation of such systems on the original hardware increasingly difficult. Porting the complete solution to new hardware, new operating system, and new programming language (including libraries and interfaces) is often expensive and associated with high risk. A migration to an emulated environment constitutes an alternative solution enabling the use of modern x86 hardware or virtualized standard x86 servers, without having to abandon the fully functioning operating system and the application environment. The virtualization solutions being sold under the product names Charon-PDP, Charon-AXP, Charon-VAX, Charon-HPA and Charon-SSP consist of a combination of virtual machine and hardware abstraction layer. They run on Microsoft Windows, Linux or VMware ESXi and provide a virtual PDP-11, VAX, AlphaServer, HP 3000, and SPARC environment. In a first step, a configuration matching the old system is created on the host platform, thereby creating an emulated guest system behaving like the old physical server. In the second step, the operating system and - as required ‚Äì associated applications and application data, are moved from the real hardware to the virtual machine. Depending on the operating system, the data is copied as physical image or file system backup. Such migrations are possible without source code changes or operating system upgrades.  Product Name  Stromasys product name Charon is inspired by Greek mythology. In ancient Greece, Charon was the ferry man, whose task was to transport the dead across the river called Styx to Hades. The Stromasys emulator provides virtualization of the old DEC hardware allowing old operating systems such as OpenVMS to continue working without change. Figuratively speaking, CHARON \\"saves‚Äú data and applications and makes them available for future use beyond the life of obsolete hardware.  Vendor  After the take-over of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) by Compaq in 1998, which in turn was taken over by Hewlett- Packard in 2002, the former manager Robert Boers bought the DEC European Migration and Porting Center, from which the company Software Resources International was formed. In the beginning, the company offered services for migration projects. After having performed migration, porting, and VMS system programming projects for some time, the company recognized the need for PDP-11 emulators. The development of the first PDP-11 emulator was followed by the development of additional emulators for PDP-11, VAX, Alpha, HP 3000 and SPARC systems. In 2008 the company was renamed to Stromasys SA, now a public company under Swiss law. In December 2013, George Koukis acquired the company. Currently, the company has over 100 employees. The company, which was founded in 1998, is now led by John Prot as CEO and CTO.

He is founder and director of the Elijah Interfaith Institute since 1997. He specializes in bridging the theological and academic dimension with a variety of practical initiatives, especially involving world religious leadership.  Personal life  Goshen-Gottstein is the son of Moshe Goshen-Gottstein ‚Äì a professor of Jewish studies, linguist, Bible scholar, and theologian ‚Äì and Esther Goshen-Gottstein, a clinical psychologist. The Jerusalem home in which Goshen-Gottstein grew up was open to students of various religions, as well as to visiting clergy. Goshen-Gottstein is married to Therese (born Andrevon), who is a close collaborator in his interfaith activities. Goshen-Gottstein has two sons, Elisha and Nerya.  Education and academic career  Goshen-Gottstein underwent religious training and was ordained a rabbi in 1978. For the following thirty years he served as a reserve chaplain in the Israeli army, but he has never practiced as a communal rabbi. Goshen-Gottstein attended Hebrew University of Jerusalem with a concentration in the fields of Talmud and Jewish Thought. He also studied at Harvard University Christianity and religions. He received a PhD from Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 1986. His thesis was on the subject \\"God and Israel as Father and Son in Tannaitic Literature.\\" His PhD was supervised by Ephraim Urbach. He has taught at a variety of Israeli universities. Goshen-Gottstein headed the Institute for the Study of Rabbinic Thought at Bet Morasha College, Jerusalem, from 1997 till 2013, and oversaw conferences and publications in the field. For a decade Goshen-Gottstein was a member of the Shalom Hartman Institute of Advanced Studies. Here, he engaged with contemporary existential issues and became versed in public interfaith conversations, for which he was in charge for several years on behalf of the Hartman Institute. Besides his academic training, Goshen-Gottstein has drawn from other Jewish and non-Jewish resources. He is affiliated with several Hassidic communities and has been deeply influenced by Hassidic teaching and spirituality. He has also published in that area. Interfaith work Goshen-Gottstein's spiritual education has included formative relations with non-Jewish spiritual masters and in‚Äìdepth relations with a broad range of Christian monastic communities. He has shared in the spiritual lives of Christian and Hindu communities and enjoyed the friendship, wisdom, and counsel of teachers from the Buddhist and Muslim traditions. His personal experience led him to found in 1997 the Elijah Interfaith Institute, initially as a consortium of 13 Jerusalem-based academic theological schools. The Institute evolved into a global gathering of premier religious figures (Elijah Board of World Religious Leaders) and scholars (Elijah Interfaith Academy). Goshen-Gottstein‚Äôs personal foundations in the field of religious leadership and academic training equipped him to moderate processes of learning and broader public engagement, involving leaders and scholars. His own interest in spirituality across religions and his extensive network of personal relationships have shaped some of the Elijah Institute‚Äôs unique programming, leading to research and publication on areas such as ‚ÄúReligious Genius‚Äù (study of saints and exceptional individual across religions); Friendship Across Religions and the study of mystical and spiritual life. His ability to negotiate religious leadership and academic scholarship and to make them address broader publics with novel insights and approaches has made him a voice on global issues related to relations between religions. He has appeared on multiple television shows in different countries, and has published op-ed pieces in different publications and in multiple languages, in addition to his own blogs. His contribution to the interreligious field was recognized by the Polish Council of Christians and Jews, that conferred upon him the title \\"Figure of Reconciliation.\\"  Publications     Goshe-Gottstein, Alon (Ed.)

Once an assembly plant for Rolls Royce cars and Brewster cars and Brewster Buffalo airplanes, it is now the corporate headquarters for JetBlue.  Usage by Brewster  The building, designed by Stephenson & Wheeler, opened in 1911 to handle the assembly of the chassis for the Brewster cars that were being built since 1905 at 47th Street and Broadway in Times Square in nearby Manhattan. The building was one of the first major developments at the foot of the Queensboro Bridge, opened in 1909, which reduced car transport from Queens to Times Square to a matter of minutes. In 1915 it began building the Brewster Knight. In 1925, the company was bought by Rolls-Royce of America, which had been operating out of a plant in Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1931, the Rolls Royce Springfield operation ended. From 1931 to 1934, Rolls-Royce Phantom II chassis were shipped directly to the Long Island City plant when Rolls Royce terminated its United States assembly program. From 1934 to 1936, under J. S. Inskip, Brewster automobiles using Ford chassis were built at the plant. The Brewster operation ceased in 1936. The Brewster Aeronautical Corporation manufactured the Brewster F2A Buffalo and a version of the Vought F4U Corsair known as the F3A-1 during World War II at the plant. The multi-story layout of the building limited airplane production efficiency. The aircraft were flown from Roosevelt Field in Mineola.

Remimazolam was found to be both faster acting and shorter lasting than midazolam, and human clinical trials showed a faster recovery time and predictable, consistent pharmacokinetics, suggesting some advantages over existing drugs for these applications. The most common side effects for procedural sedation include hypotension (low blood pressure), hypertension (high blood pressure), diastolic hypertension, systolic hypertension, hypoxia (low blood oxygen level), and diastolic hypotension. Remimazolam was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2020.  Medical uses  Remimazolam is indicated for the induction and maintenance of procedural sedation in adults lasting 30 minutes or less.  History  Remimazolam was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2020. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved remimazolam based on evidence from three clinical trials (Trial 1/NCT02290873, Trial 2/NCT02296892 and Trial 3/NCT02532647) in adults undergoing short procedures. Trials were conducted at 32 sites in the United States. Trials 1 and 3 were conducted in participants undergoing colonoscopy and Trial 2 was conducted in participants undergoing bronchoscopy procedures. In the trials, participants were randomly divided in three groups: one group received remimazolam, one group received placebo and one group received midazolam (similar, but approved drug). In the first two groups, neither participants nor investigators knew which medications were given and participants could also receive midazolam as a rescue drug when needed for sedation. In the third group, all participants received midazolam only Additionally, in all three trials participants received a medication for pain control Trials 1 and 2 compared participants who received remimazolam to participants in the other two groups, measuring the success of sedation with the set of pre-determined criteria. Data from Trial 3 were used primarily to assess the side effects of remimazolam when multiple dosing is used.  Research  Phase I and Ib dose-finding studies for procedural sedation with patients recovering faster from remimazolam than midazolam. Phase II trials comparing remimazolam to the standard anesthesia protocols for cardiac surgery and colonoscopy were presented at major conferences in October 2014. A Phase IIa trial comparing remimazolam to midazolam for upper endoscopy was published in December 2014, finding a similar safety profile. Remimazolam was originally discovered in the late 1990s at Glaxo Wellcome in their labs in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.

Such systems are frequently seen in the telecommunications field, specifically when it comes to wireless service, digital and cable television options, and broadband internet access.Rouskas, G.N. (2009). Internet tiered services: Theory, economics, and quality of service. New York: Springer. When a wireless company, for example, charges customers different amounts based on the number of cellphone voice minutes, text messages, amount of data and other features they desire, the company is utilizing the principle of tiered service. This is also seen in charging different prices for services such as the speed of one's internet connection and the number of cable television channels one has access to. Tiered pricing allows customers access to these services who may not otherwise due to financial constraints, ultimately reflecting the diversity of consumer needs and resources. Tiered service helps to keep quality of service standards for high-bandwidth applications like streaming video or VoIP. This comes at a cost of increasing costs for better service levels. Major players in the net neutrality debate have proposed tiered internet so content providers who pay more to Internet service providers get better quality service. History It was not until the Internet began its rapid evolution that tiered services became a controversial issue. And it was not until the early 2000s that Internet carriers considered the option of abandoning net neutrality policies. In 2005, the FCC changed the way broadband service providers are regulated. This made broadband service providers \\"information services\\" instead of \\"telecommunications services\\". This means broadband service providers were no longer subject to common carrier regulations. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, common carriage guidelines required the quality of service must be the same for all users, preventing one customer from being favored over another. During the first decades of the 1900s, this policy related directly to the telephone industry, and AT&T; specifically. However, in recent decades, the policy has grown to encompass a broader range of communication services. Preventing preferential treatment of customers in the realm of the Internet is referred to as the policy of net neutrality. In the US, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Michael Powell, considered net neutrality to be fundamental to the success of the Internet and he viewed it as one of the basic rules to maintaining freedom on the Internet. The FCC continued its skepticism of tiered pricing for quite some time, and it was not until concerns about the availability of the spectrum began to surface that things began to change. In 2010, FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski announced that the benefits of tiered pricing include helping to prevent data backups on networks. Genachowski expressed his fear of a coming \\"spectrum crisis\\" as a result of the increase in smartphone usage ultimately clogging carrier networks. The FCC suggested a number of solutions to the problem including greater use of the unlicensed Wi-Fi spectrum, more femtocells, and more efficient arrangement of cellular towers, but even these measures were not believed to be enough to keep spectrum bands open. Attempts have been made to put price controls on tiered service. United States Congress put a bill forth to prevent a \\"two-tiered pricing scheme with priority service.\\" The bill did not pass Congress, but allowed the FCC to stop ISPs from blocking websites. The way ISPs tier services for content providers and application providers is through \\"access-tiering\\". This is when a network operator grants bandwidth priority to those willing to pay for quality service. \\"Consumer- tiering\\" is where different speeds are marketed to consumers and prices are based on the consumers willingness to pay. Net neutrality Net neutrality is the practice of keeping Internet service providers from offering tiered service and controlling the ability to block out competition by restricting certain pipelines within the Internet. By blocking these pipelines, the provider creates an unfair transfer of packets across the Internet, diminishing the quality of service. Internet service providers seek to discriminate against peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, FTP, online games, and high bandwidth activities, such as video streaming. This practice is called bandwidth throttling. In 2017, the FCC Voted to repeal \\"Net Neutrality\\" in their \\"Restoring Internet Freedom\\" Order. Fulling taking effect on June 11th 2018, the initiative removed barriers of the Title II regulations that had been placed on the Internet Service Providers in 2015. Due to the repeal, Internet Service Providers can initiate tiered internet services and are no longer required to treat all online traffic as equal. With the removed regulations, Internet Service Providers can move forward with creating tiered internet services. Proponents of the repeal argue that the tiered internet service will allow for increased innovation in the internet. Detractors argue that it will create anti-consumer measures that crowd out emerging businesses and create a bundling system that is not within consumer preference.  Responses to repealing net neutrality  Within the United States alone, many have feared that the elimination of net neutrality will cause widespread damage to the accessibility and freedom of the internet. Particularly, senators such as Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire have openly criticized decisions by the Federal Communications Commission to repeal net neutrality rules in their 2017 Order. In a U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship that occurred in May 2018, Senator Shaheen stated that a lack of net neutrality will have \\"major ramifications for consumers as well as for small businesses.\\" The Senator goes on to elaborate that small businesses within her state have expressed fears that broadband providers will create unfair pay systems for access to the internet that would inevitable put them at a competitive disadvantage. These concerns are especially valid in regions of New Hampshire where rural communities do not have access to high-speed broadband, or limited access with only one provider. Despite outspoken opposition from those such as Senator Shaheen, many data carriers argue that the ability to differentiate charges and access of data will allow them to increase incentives to develop innovation. This developed innovation will lead to faster service and better accessibility to content for all consumers. Most recently, the FCC's move to adopt the 2017 Order has reignited the debate over how much Congress should regulate the existing net neutrality laws. The debates over this regulatory framework are expected to continue in the 116th Congress. Tiered Internet =Implications= A tiered Internet gives priority to packets sent and received by end users that pay a premium for service. Network operators do this to simplify things such as network management and equipment configuration, traffic engineering, service level agreements, billing, and customer support. =Tiered service fair queuing= Fair queuing is an algorithm that allows for network moderators to control packets by assigning flow weights. Groups of guaranteed-service applications are classed by their nature (e.g. \\"voice\\",\\"video\\",\\"game\\") based on similar bandwidth and delay requirements. These guaranteed-service applications are given priority over best-effort applications which are limited by the access bandwidth available to the user. =Continuous rate network model= The continuous-rate network model allow users to request any amount of bandwidth necessary for their uses and the network must be able to provide any arbitrary amount requested. There must be mechanisms put into place by the network provider that allows for a distinguishing to be made for these arbitrary requests. This process can become almost impossible for traffic with a finite duration. Bandwidth requests are inherently variable in size, arrival time, and duration and creates link capacity across the continuous rate network to become fragmented. The network would then have much difficulty in maintaining a sufficient level of utilization and users‚Äô expected quality of service. =Arguments= Initial reasoning against tiered service was that ISPs would use it to block content on the Internet. Internet service providers could use this to prioritize affiliated partners instead of unaffiliated ones. Many argue that one fast network is much more efficient than deliberately throttling web traffic to create a tiered Internet. =AT&T;= AT&T; had a trial in 2008 in Reno, NV which was one of the first cases of tiered service for in-home broadband internet pertaining to the amount of data used. =BT Group= BT Group, a British telecommunications giant, is now going to charge users of their service extra for faster delivery of content. Meaning that they will not be handling all traffic across their network equally. Tiered cellular data plans =AT&T;= AT&T; revised their cellular data plans to create data tiers for specific types of usage. AT&T; indicated that tiered pricing may be brought on in the future for LTE data plans. =Metro PCS= MetroPCS has been accused of violating net neutrality by their proposed tiered cell phone data services. With some of these services being capped at a certain maximum, this violates various agreements for an open Internet. =Sprint= Sprint is implementing tiered data plans for their mobile broadband products. The plans come in 3GB, 5GB, and 10GB capacities. Sprint previously claimed to have unlimited service, as this is their first venture into tiered pricing schemes. =Verizon= Verizon Wireless introduced their LTE network with the capability for tiered services at the end of 2010. Because the company's 4G network is now available in cities across the United States, Verizon has the opportunity to charge premium prices for faster data delivery. Such data plans allow Verizon to charge under a tiered service platform, similar to many home wired Internet services. Arguments There are many arguments between ISPs, who traditionally support tiered services, and network neutrality proponents. ISPs state that tiered services are necessary to keep and maintain network performance. Also, tiered pricing schemes provide ISPs with an incentive to upgrade their networks and provide better service. Network neutrality proponents say that ISPs do not have the right to degrade Internet services to certain users and that their service should be open and consistent. Verizon CEO, Ivan Seidenberg, expressed his concerns with network neutrality regulations saying that stricter regulations preventing tiered services ignore the \\"benefits of smart networks.\\" In 2011, it was reported that both critics and proponents believe that the debate over net neutrality and tiered services has become increasingly more partisan.

He made his first theatrical appearance in 1910, commencing a career in which he played in most of the works of William Shakespeare. He joined the company of Oscar Asche in 1911, and later that year joined the company of Frank Benson, for whom he appeared as Hamlet and as Demetrius in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1915). During World War I he briefly enlisted in the Inns of Court O.T.C in January 1916 but having \\"a marked deformity of the toes since birth making marching impossible\\" he was discharged in May 1916 as \\"not being likely to become an efficient soldier (on medical grounds).\\"British Army WWI Pension Records 1914-1920 for Henry Howard Baynton - Ancestry.com In 1916 Baynton appeared at the Stratford Festival, and in 1917 he joined the theatrical company of H.B. Irving at the Savoy Theatre, playing Laertes to Irving's Hamlet. In 1920 Baynton formed his own theatrical company, with whom he played Orlando in As You Like It, Romeo in Romeo and Juliet, Shylock in The Merchant of Venice, Brutus in Julius Caesar, the title roles in Henry V, Richard III, Hamlet, King Lear and Othello, Bottom in A Midsummer Night's DreamGriffiths, Trevor R (Ed.), A Midsummer Night's Dream Cambridge University Press (1996) pg 104 Google Books Falstaff, and Petruchio in The Taming of the Shrew. In 1922 the company was taken over by Robert Courtneidge from when Baynton was paid a salary of ¬£50 a week plus a share of the profits. He played the Burgomaster Mathias in The Bells at the Savoy Theatre in 1924 with the scenery from the original production staged by Henry Irving. Baynton's performance was not favourably received by the critics, who compared him adversely to Henry Irving, who had made the role his own.Jones-Evans, Eric (editor), Henry Irving and the Bells: Irving's Personal Script of the Play Manchester University Press (1980) pg 26 Baynton toured the provinces between 1926 and 1930 appearing in the works of Shakespeare and various other plays. Baynton went into partnership to regain control of the company but the venture failed with Baynton losing between ¬£3,000 and ¬£4,000. He was made bankrupt and was forced to disband his theatrical company in 1930, making him among the last of the actor-managers. He was then reduced to giving acting and elocution lessons in Birmingham, earning about ¬£3 a week.

FCC is the 2004 court case in which the Washington, D.C., Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Federal Communication Commission's Triennial Review Order (TRO). The court's decision is based on the Telecommunications Act of 1996 section 251 which defines unbundled network elements (UNEs) for incumbent local exchange carriers and competitive local exchange carriers.United States Telecom Association, et al. v. FCC & USA (D.C. Cir. 2004) Following the Court of Appeals' decision the FCC requested that the case be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. In June 2004 the solicitor general announced that a request for the Supreme Court to review the case would not be made. As a result of the solicitor general's decision the FCC would issue its Triennial Review Remand Order (TRRO) creating new rules and regulations for unbundled network elements. History The Telecommunications Act of 1996 required local incumbent exchange carriers(ILECs) to maintain the availability of physical network components, or Unbundled Network Element (UNEs), for use by other telecommunication carriers, or Competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs). The Act gave the FCC the responsibility to decide which network components would maintain availability, measuring with the standard of if \\"the failure to provide access to such network elements would impair the ability of the telecommunications carrier seeking access to provide the services that it seeks to offer.\\" In August of that year, the FCC's Report and Order identified seven Unbundled Network Elements and resulted in two unbundling models. The UNEs included: * Local loops * Network interface devices * Local and tandem switching * Interoffice transmission facilities * Signaling networks and call related databases * Operations support systems * Operator services and directory assistance The UNE-P model consisted of local loop and switching and transportation, and allowed CLECs to enter the market without investing in supporting equipment and facilities. The further Unbundled Network Element -inclusive enhanced extended loop (EEL) model allowed CLECs to serve customers more easily by using their own local and tandem switching equipment. While CLECs and new market entrants said UNE-P helped open the local telecommunications market, ILECs claimed Unbundled Network Element practices served as a heavily discounted resale of their own network elements. Controversy that lead to the first USTA v. FCC case occurred in FCC's third Report and Order. The order required telecommunications carriers to allow law enforcement agencies access to carriers' individual phone calls and caller information, as outlined the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994. In court, The FCC stated that it had \\"exceeded its statutory authority,\\" and agreed to remove certain aspects of the order. The removed portions included the information accessible to law enforcement of custom calling features and dialed telephone numbers during connected phone calls. Triennial Review Remand Order (TRRO) The Triennial Remand Order or TRRO was a response to the decision in USTA v. FCC in which the D.C. Circuit Court vacated many of the provisions set forth in the original Triennial Review Order created in 2003. In a 3‚Äì2 vote along party lines, FCC Commissioners approved the Triennial Remand Order, which was officially adopted and enacted on February 4, 2005. The Triennial Remand Order among other things discussed high capacity loops, interoffice transport, mass market local circuit switching Unbundled Network Element-P, and unbundled network elements all issues that had been discussed three times prior when trying to fulfill the sharing portion (Section 251) of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Though it was requested that the TRRO address and grant element access to wireless carriers, the FCC found that no wireless carrier could or would be impaired by not having access to landline network elements or Unbundled Network Elements.http://search.proquest.com/docview/213215565 One of the key factors in including high capacity loops in the Triennial Remand Order is the fact that it was one of the few elements that the D.C. Circuit did not vacate in their order in USTA v. FCC. In the TRRO high capacity loops were readdressed and refined by the FCC to the point of saying that CLECs would be impaired without access to DS3 and DS1-capacity loops except in buildings and service areas with more than 60,000 lines. The FCC did make one new exception to the high capacity loop portion and that was that it found CLECs are not at a disadvantage without access to dark fiber loops in any instance and therefore removed that element from the list of things Incumbent local exchange carriers have to share. Similar to high-capacity loops the FCC in the TRRO reevaluated how interoffice competition could be made possible between CLECs and ILECs. In the revised order the FCC determined that CLECs would only be impaired, a measure in determining access, in cases of DS3 and DS1 capacity loops in businesses that had at least 24,000 business lines. The numbers mentioned in the TRRO were important because the D.C. Circuit vacated many previous provisions by the FCC for lack of clear definitions and specific standards. When dealing with mass market local circuit switching the Triennial Remand Order and the FCC found that ILECs would no longer have an obligation to provide CLECs unbundled access to these network elements. Mass market local circuit switching, which was considered part of the unbundled network elements platform included the unbundled loop, unbundled local circuit switching, and shared transport. The order to remove Unbundled Network Element platforms from the TRRO either forced many CLECs out of the long distance market or forced CLECs to design and create their own platforms. For the first time the FCC used the Triennial Review Order to address the issue of broadband access loops and sharing for CLECs This portion of the order upset many Incumbent local exchange carriers companies as it forced them in certain situations to provide broadband access loop elements [CLECs. Compared to previous FCC rulings that left a lot of decisions to individual state public utility commissions the FCC made a clear framework for the type of cases CLECs would need to present in order to access ILEC broadband access loops and prove that they would be severely impaired without it. These elements today are different as many cable companies that provide broadband access are excluded from having to share their broadband elements and access points; a result of being considered an information service rather than a telecommunications service. The Triennial Remand Order was the fourth time that the FCC had to rewrite its own rules to fulfill Section 251 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. In 2006 the D.C. Circuit rejected claims in Covad Communications Company et al. v. FCC, affirming the unbundling and sharing rules made by the FCC in the Triennial Remand Order . The D.C. Circuit and many other courts have since reaffirmed the decision that CLECs have to provide and demonstrate that they would be competitively impaired in order to gain access to any of the remaining unbundled network elements. Ruling On March 2, 2004 the U.S. appeals court ruled that the FCC lacks the authority to delegate responsibility for setting those rates to the states. It ruled that the FCC had failed to prove that competitors in the local phone market are impaired without government regulated access to critical parts of the phone network controlled by the regional giants. Along with upholding the Triennial Review Order's exemption provided to incumbent carriers from unbundling for certain fiber-fed loops and for line sharing. The ruling was unanimous amongst the three judges and stated that the FCC erred by not providing unified federal guidelines, but rather pushing FCC decisions onto the states. Implications With this ruling in place regional companies believed that the rates set by the government were too low and gave the competition an unfair advantage. A representative of SBC stated that without the regulation they would have still given competitors access to their networks, but at rates set by the market not by the government. Whereas competitors like AT&T; Corp and MCI stated that without the regulated rates, they would have to get out of the local phone business in many markets because the regional companies' rates would be too high. In an article by ISP Planet, they described that the courts decision had completely changed the economics of monopolies in these markets. By forcing a regulated price on the companies the monopolistic companies are now unable to make profits because they cannot set their own rates. However this also skews the capitalist market because the rates may not be what the customer is willing to pay or lower.

Matua is a sect of folk Hinduism without chaturvarna system . The movement was launched as a reformation by the followers of Harichand Thakur. Born to a peasant family belonging to the Namah≈õ≈´dras community, Thakur attained atmadarshan at an early age and would subsequently preach his Darshan in Twelve Directives. The teachings of Thakur establish education as preeminently important for the adherent and the upliftment of the population the adherent's duty, while also providing a formula for ending social conflict. Matua-mahasangha believe in Swayam-Dikshiti (\\"Self-Realisation\\"). So anyone who has faith in the Darshan or Philosophy of God Harichand belongs to the Matua-mahasanhga. After Partition in 1947, many of the Matua migrated to West Bengal in India.  History  Harichand Thakur was born to a peasant family belonging to the Namah≈õ≈´dras community. According to historian Sekhar Bandyopadhyay, Thakur \\"experienced atma darshan or self revelation, and the followers believe that he is the incarnation of God himself, born in this world to bring salvation to the downtrodden\\". He established the Matua sect of Vaishnavite Hinduism. The Matua Mahasangha movement was launched as a reformation by the followers of Harichand Thakur.  Organisations  Initially the Matua-mahasangha followers or \\"matuas\\" formed an organisation in Orakandi, Faridpur, Bengal Presidency (now in Bangladesh). After 1947, followers formed a second organisation in Thakurnagar, West Bengal, India. At first, it was very difficult to form the temple. The temple was initially looked after by Thakur's family, but as of 2011 it was managed by a trustee chosen by the followers. Followers may be found throughout India and Bangladesh. In some locations they have established worshipping places. In the beginning Matua-mahasangha followed simplified rituals, but later adopted Vaishnavism.

The three ecological zones In 1955, Umesao traveled through Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, shattering his conventional dualistic image of the continent consisting of ‚ÄúSeiyo‚Äù (Occident) and ‚ÄúToyo‚Äù (Orient), and inspiring in him the notion of the ‚ÄúChuyo‚Äù (Mediant, or Middle world). These reflections led to the paper ‚ÄúIntroduction to the Ecological Conception of the History of Civilizations‚Äù (1957), which ten years later was expanded into a book, An Ecological View of History (1967). In his theory, he divides the Eurasian continent into three major ecological zones: Japan, the Mediant, and Western Europe. He argues that Japan and Western Europe, because of their similar environmental and socio- historical conditions on the peripheries of imperial and civilizational centers, are analogous civilizations that evolved in parallel and autonomously. This view was influential for historians and anthropologists, but also popularly for the post-war generation of Japanese, as a counter model to the euro-centric conception of history, where Japan would have achieved modernization only through Western influences. Comparative study of pastoral societies He conducted studies on pastoral societies in Tanzania (1963‚Äì64) and in Libya (1968) as well. Whereas Euro-American pastoral anthropologists tended to concentrate their attention mainly on people, Umesao‚Äôs approach differed in the way he focused on the interaction between animals and humans. The outcome of his research, The World of Hunting and Nomadism (1976), influenced subsequent Japanese pastoral anthropologists. For his contribution to the study of nomads, he was honored as a Person of Cultural Merit in Mongolia in 1998. Information industry Umesao also developed theories on the increasing importance of ‚Äúinformation‚Äù as a social phenomenon, combining concepts of animal embryology and civilization history. In his ‚ÄúInformation Industry Theory: Dawn of the Coming Era of the Ectodermal Industry‚Äù (1963), he claimed that following the agricultural age (that is comparable to the endodermic stage in embryology where the digestive system is formed) and the industrial age (which is the mesodermic stage where the bones, muscles and circulatory system appear), a new society will form around the information industry. He argued that with the development of mass media and computers, information will become an important economic factor, and that this was equivalent to the ectodermal stage where the brain, nerves and sense organs come to function. He was thus one of the earliest to predict the coming of the Information Age. His pioneering contribution was recognized with the C & C Prize funded by the NEC Corporation in 2002. Popular press Umesao's work was not limited to the theoretical side of scholarship. The Art of Intellectual Production (1969) was a guide on how to collect and record information, arrange them in a logical order, and compose the results of research in readable Japanese. It was a practical manual on information processing before the diffusion of computers, and it became a longtime best- seller. Many of his writings appeared in non-academic journals or as paperbacks, accessible to the general public. National Museum of Ethnology After his involvement in organizing the World Exposition of 1970 held in Osaka, Umesao was instrumental in the founding of the National Museum of Ethnology that opened in the Osaka Expo grounds in 1977. Appointed as head of the museum‚Äôs preparatory office in 1974, he set forth his team of young scholars on ethnological expeditions across the globe assembling documentary materials and artifacts. He remained as the director-general of the museum until his retirement in 1993, continuing as museum‚Äôs special advisor until his death in 2010. It was upon the initiative of Dr. Umesao that the museum housed a series of international symposia on ‚ÄúCivilization Studies‚Äù between 1983 and 1998, funded by the Taniguchi Foundation. This was an international joint research project run in cooperation with prominent Japanologists, Josef Kreiner (Bonn University) and Harumi Befu (Stanford University). Scholars from Eurasia and North America were invited to discuss key issues concerning the Japanese civilization in the modern world, with the goal of reconfiguring the history of civilizations from a Japanese perspective. Publications followed in Japanese and English. International dissemination Umesao‚Äôs most influential work was not accessible in English until only recently. However, his writings have been translated into French, German, Italian, Chinese, Mongolian, Esperanto, and Vietnamese. He has held lectures in Korea, U.S.A, Brazil, and France. He was invited in 1984 to give a lecture series at the Coll√®ge de France in Paris, an offer seldom presented to foreign scholars. He subsequently received the title of Commandeur of Ordre des Palmes acad√©miques in 1988 from the French government.

In the late nineteenth century during the Albanian struggle and Albanian National Awakening, Skanderbeg became a symbol for Albanians and he was turned into a national Albanian hero and myth. After the death of Skanderbeg the Arb√´resh (Italo-Albanians) migrated from the Balkans to southern Italy were his memory and exploits survived and were maintained among them in their musical repertoire. From the 16th to the early 19th century Skanderbeg's fame survived only in Christian Europe and was based on perception of Skanderbeg being Antemurale Christianitatis against invading Ottoman Turks. In the largely Islamized Albania of this period his fame largely faded, though his memory was still alive in oral tradition, to be rediscovered at the end of the 19th century when the Arbereshe passed their traditions concerning Skanderbeg to Albanian elites outside Italy. This way the figure of Skanderbeg was brought to the level of national hero. Albanian nationalist writers transformed Skanderbeg's history into myth and thus his figure and deeds became a mixture of historical facts, truths, half-truths, inventions, and folklore. The Myth of Skanderbeg is the only myth of Albanian nationalism that is based on a person; the others are based on ideas, abstract concepts, and collectivism. Unlike the myth of the Pelasgian origin, the myth of Skanderbeg was not fabricated by Albanian intellectuals; the myth of Skanderbeg was part of the Arbereshe folklore and collective memory. According to Oliver Jens Schmitt, \\"there are two different Skanderbegs today: the historic Skanderbeg, and a mythic national hero as presented in Albanian schools and nationalist intellectuals in Tirana and Pristina.\\"  History  = Antemurale Christianitatis = Skanderbeg's painting Skanderbeg is built in part of the antemurale myth complex which portrays Albanians united by Skanderbeg as protectors of the nation and Christendom against \\"invading Turks\\". In the 16th century, the \\"Defence against the Turks\\" had become a central topic in East Central and South East Europe. It was put in functional use and served as a propaganda tool and to mobilize religious feelings of the population. People who participated in campaigns against the Ottoman Empire were referred to as ‚Äúantemurale Christianitatis‚Äù (the protective wall of Christianity). The Pope Calixtus III gave Skanderbeg the title Athleta Christi, or Champion of Christ. Furthermore, according to Louise Marshall, during the 18th century the Myth of Skanderbeg was moulded and transformed to suit the taste and the anxieties of the British readers. Under the influence of the Myth of Skanderbeg and antemurale myth, the Albanian Catholic clergy seems to understand the figure of Mother Teresa as Skanderbeg's ideological heir who completes his task of guarding the boundaries of Catholicism and Albanianism, introducing a new era after the end of glorious era that culminated with Skanderbeg. In contrast to the Skanderbegs' myths of Albanian Christians, the Myth of Skanderbeg of Albania's Muslim community had a positive outcome because the glory of the Illyrian era did not end with Skanderbeg, but continued into the Ottoman era. =Skanderbeg and Serbo-Montenegrin expansionism= Serbo-Montenegrin-Greek-Ottoman occupation of Albania. While Greek references to Skanderbeg were used up, Serbian historians, often contradictorily, used Skanderbeg as a symbol of joint Serbian-Albanian progress (1866). On the other hand, forty years later, in a different political environment, the faded memory of Skanderbeg among a large portion of Albanians was used as evidence of a lack of an ethnic identity and even the said Serbian character of the medieval hero. Spiridon Gopƒçeviƒá, a proponent of Serbian expansionism in the Ottoman Balkans, claimed that northern Albanians are actually Serbs and Skanderbeg's main motivation was his feelings of Serb national injury. In Montenegro, a country which had tribal structures similar to the ones in northern Albania and also had a similar mentality, Skanderbeg was celebrated as a Slavic hero, a concept which was incorporated into the movement to justify an expansion of Montenegro into northern Albania. By the end of the 19th century, one could find a wide dissemination of brochures with Skanderbeg being presented as a Slavic hero along the Montenegro-Albania border. The myth is particularly popular in Kuƒçi tribe where the Drekaloviƒá brotherhood, also known as Novokuƒçi (New Kuƒçi) claims descent from him. In Serbian historiography it has been supported that Skanderbeg's great-grandfather, named Branilo was a nobleman from Zeta who was granted possession of Kanin√´ after taking part in Emperor Stefan Du≈°an's conquests. This reading is based on a mistaken translation by Karl Hopf in the 19th century and has been discredited ever since.Harry Hodgkinson, Scanderbeg: From Ottoman Captive to Albanian Hero, with editors Bejtullah D. Destani and Westrow Cooper, contributor David Abulafia, I. B. Tauris, 2005, , p. 224: The claim that Skanderbeg was Slav was first made by a German who misread a document of 1368 in Serbian. Among the signatories were a Branilo (a Slav Christian name) of Vlora and a Castrioti of Kanina. By overlooking the single letter \\"i\\" (meaning and), he produced Branilo Castrioti as Scanderbeg's Serbian great grandfather. It became popular in Serbian propaganda circles again in the 1980s, right before the crisis in Kosovo, where Serb historians again celebrated Skanderbeg as \\"the son of Ivan, ƒêorƒë Kastrioti, the Serbian horseman of Albania.\\" During the 2000s Skanderbeg's origins was a topic on internet chat rooms and that the figure was over time increasingly included into Serbian national narratives. = Skanderbeg during the Albanian National Awakening = Naim Frasheri in 1898 Skanderbeg's figure assumed a new dimension of the Albanian national hero. The wars between the Ottomans and Skanderbeg along with his death resulted in the migration of Albanians to southern Italy and creation of the Arb√´resh community (Italo-Albanians). The memory of Skanderbeg and his exploits was maintained and survived among the Arb√´resh through songs, in the form of a Skanderbeg cycle. \\"The memory of the Albanian national hero was maintained vividly among the Albanians of Italy, those who emigrated to Calabria and Sicily, following his death.... Living compactly in Christian territory, though in separate communities, the Italo- Albanians have preserved the songs about Skenderbeg and his exploits which their ancestors had brought from the mother country. Today one may even speak of the existence of a Skenderbeg cycle among them, if one takes into account also the songs on other Albanian heroes who surrounded him.\\" Skanderbeg's fame survived in Christian Europe for centuries, while in largely Islamized Albania it largely faded, though his memory was still alive in oral tradition. It was only in the 19th century, in the period of the Albanian National Revival, that Skanderbeg was rediscovered and raised to the level of national mythm for all Albanians. During the late nineteenth century the symbolism of Skanderbeg increased in an era of Albania national struggles that turned the medieval figure into a national Albanian hero. The Arbereshe passed their traditions concerning Skanderbeg to Albanian elites outside Italy. Thus, the myth of Skanderbeg was not fabricated by Albanian intellectuals like the myth of the Pelasgian origin was; the myth of Skanderbeg was part of the Arbereshe folklore and collective memory. Although Skanderbeg had already been used in the construction of the Albanian national code, especially in communities of Arbƒóresh, it was only in the final years of the 19th century with the publication of the work of Naim Frash√´ri \\"Istori'e Skenderbeut\\" in 1898 that his figure assumed a new dimension. Naim Frasheri was the biggest inspiration and guide for most Albanian poets and intellectuals. Albanian nationalists needed an episode from medieval history for the centre of the Albanian nationalistic mythology and they chose Skanderbeg, in the absence of the medieval kingdom or empire. The figure of Skanderbeg was subjected to Albanisation, and he was presented as a national hero. Later books and periodicals continued this theme, and nationalist writers transformed history into myth. The religious aspect of Skanderbeg's struggle against Muslims was minimized by Albanian nationalists because it could divide Albanians and undermine their unity as Albanians are both Muslims and Christians. In the late Ottoman period Albanian intellectuals claimed that Skanderbeg had overcome self interest and religious loyalty through service and loyalty toward an Albanian nation, itself absent in the fifteenth century.Shinasi A. Rama, \\"Nation Failure, Ethnic Elites, and Balance of Power\\", Springer, 2019, p. 94 There was significant effort of the Albanian historiography to adapt the facts about Skanderbeg to meet the requests of the contemporary ideology. Although the Myth of Skanderbeg had little to do with the reality it was incorporated in works about history of Albania. At the height of the Rilindja movement, in 1912, Skanderbeg's flag was raised in Vlor√´. = Skanderbeg in Greek literature = Skanderbeg was a figure featured in 19th century Greek literature. Papadopoulo Vretto published a biography on Skanderbeg and presented him as a defender of Christianity against the Muslim Ottomans and a 'proud Epirotan' descendant of king Pyrrhus of ancient Epirus. The book itself did not claim Skanderbeg as Greek, yet the text became influential in shaping a long tradition within Greek literature that appropriated him as a Greek national hero and patriot. Greek revolutionaries read the book and commemorated his Skanderbeg actions as ones of Greek and Christian pride. At the time as the idea of an Albanian nation consolidated Papadopoulo's book spread to the Arberesh√´ (Albanian) diaspora of southern Italy and it influenced Italo-Albanian intellectuals who sought to elevate figures such as Skanderbeg as an Albanian hero and differentiate themselves from Greeks. = Skanderbeg in Macedonian narratives = From the early 2000s, the figure of Skanderbeg and his ethnic background has attracted the attention of Macedonian academia and ethnic Macedonians. The popularity of Skanderbeg and his status as a \\"national hero\\" has grown in Macedonia and ideas exist that he had Slavic origins, lived in a Slavic context or was from Tetovo. \\"Sk√´nderbeg is also increasingly considered a ‚Äònational hero‚Äô in neighbouring Macedonia, where, in 2006, a large statue was erected in Skopje. Increasingly popular in Macedonia, is the idea that Sk√´nderbeg had ‚Äòslavic‚Äô roots, lived his life in a ‚Äòslavic‚Äô context and/or was originally from Tetovo in modern day Macedonia (Alagjozovski, 2007).\\" Skanderbeg has featured in a 2006 novel by philosopher and translator Dragi Mihajlovski that told the narratives of thirteen people and their views of him. Petar Popovski, an essayist wrote a 1200-page book that claimed he located historical evidence of Skanderbeg's ethnic and national Macedonian origins. Popovski also criticised Macedonian authorities for not incorporating Skanderbeg as part of the national Macedonian genealogy. The majority of Macedonian academia rejects such claims over Skanderbeg as not based on historical evidence. During the 2000s Skanderbeg's origins was a topic among Macedonians on internet chat rooms and that the figure was over time being more included into Macedonian national narratives. Rumors also existed in Macedonia that a statue dedicated to Skanderbeg as a \\"Macedonian junak\\" might be erected in Prilep by government authorities. = Exploits of Skanderbeg's figure = Skanderbeg's name, horse, and sword summarize exploits of his figure: # Nomen est omen is used in the exploitation of Skanderbeg's figure by connecting his name with Alexander the Great, who defended his territory, and implying that Skanderbeg also struggled to defend his territory from the Ottoman Empire. # The sword used by Skanderbeg was a present of the sultan and was endowed with magical powers. # The horse connects the mythological hero with both earthly and spiritual powers, also making the hero look taller. The neighing of Skanderbeg's horse caused terror among his enemies. At the dawn of the 20th century, the figure of Skanderbeg as the Albanian national hero took another dimension through the appearance of pretenders to the throne who claimed his descent. Being aware of the myth of Skanderbeg, many pretenders on the Albanian throne, like the German nobleman Wilhelm of Wied and several European adventurers, named themselves and their descendants after Skanderbeg. Both Zogu and Enver Hoxha presented themselves as heirs of Skanderbeg. One of the important reasons for the regime of Enver Hoxha to emphasize the interest in Skanderbeg's period was to justify the building of a totalitarian dictatorship. Albanian historians intensively mythologized Skanderbeg during communist regime to give legitimacy to the policy of the government. The main components of various interpretations of the picture of Skanderbeg are still present, except that communist ideological components installed by Hoxha's regime have been replaced by nationalist ones. In some historical and commercial publications, Adem Jashari (1955‚Äî1998) is portrayed as the new Albanian national hero in a historical succession of Skanderbeg. Transformation of Skanderbeg into a national symbol served both national cohesion and as an argument for Albania's cultural affinity to Europe because the national narrative of Skanderbeg symbolized the sacrifice of the Albanians in \\"defending Europe from Asiatic hordes\\". Pro-European public discourse in modern Albania uses the Myth of Skanderbeg as evidence of Albania's European identity.  Legacy  As a national hero, Albanian politicians in power have over time promoted the figure of Skanderbeg and he has been revered and acclaimed in oral history. The exploits of Skanderbeg are celebrated as the struggle for freedom from foreign control, ethnic and national Albanian accomplishment, the wisdom of a past Albanian ruler, a figure that transcends multi-ethnic Balkan divisions and a regional contributor to European history. The role of Skanderbeg as a Christian figure that fought against the (Muslim) Ottoman conquest of the continent has been deemphasised over time. Because of the insufficient primary sources it is difficult to pin down the \\"hero of the Albanian nation\\" status of Skanderbeg. Both Albanian communists and Christians have constructed Skanderbeg into a national figure. Contemporary Muslim Albanians deemphasize the (Christian) religious heritage of Skanderbeg by viewing him as a defender of the nation and he is promoted as an Albanian symbol of Europe and the West.. Since Skanderbeg occupies the central place in Albanian national myths, it complicates his critical analysis by the historians. Those who performed a critical analysis of Skanderbeg, as Vienna historian Oliver Jens Schmitt did, would quickly be accused of committing sacrilege and sullying the Albanian national honor. An emphasis on Skanderbeg's struggle and conflict with the Ottomans as a symbol to create a unitary Albanian state has volatile implications because it is not restricted to Albania as was under the government of Hoxha, but encompasses the wider area inhabited by Albanians within the Balkans. The myth of Skanderbeg represents the main ingredient of the debate about future aspirations of the Albanian nation. Skanderbeg Myth in academic research Myth of Skanderbeg was included in the program of the following academic conferences: * The Role of Myths in History and Development in Albania, held in London, Great Britain, on June 11‚Äì13, 1999 * The myth of Skanderbeg, held in Palermo, Italy on March 29, 2007 * A living Skanderbeg, the multidisciplinary analysis of the myth, historical facts and current knowledge about George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, held in Lecce, Italy, on March 12‚Äì13, 2009 * The lexicon of identity and exclusion, held in Palazzo Chiaramonte, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy, on October 13‚Äì14, 2009 with The Hero and the Nation: On the Various Interpretations of Skanderbeg‚Äôs Myth * George Kastriot Skanderbeg: the history and image held on May 28, 2010 in Durres, Albania * Recycling Myths, Inventing Nations, held on July 14‚Äì16, 2010 at Gregynog Hall, the University of Wales Conference Centre, UK The key question in scientific research of the Myth of Skanderbeg is not its historical basis, or whether it has one at all, but the investigation of its meanings and purposes.

On April 28 1964 Prime Minister Milton Margai died. His brother, Albert Margai, was appointed as new prime minister. On August 4 1964 Sierra Leone currency, the Sierra Leonean leone, was established. In 1967 general elections were held in Sierra Leone. The APC won by a narrow margin. Brigadier John Lansana, head of the military, seized control of government immediately after swearing in of the new APC prime minister, Siaka Stevens. Lansana was ousted a few days later by junior military officers who invite Andrew Juxon-Smith, a senior officer on leave, to return and head a provisional government, the National Reformation Council (NRC).

It is aimed at young people, and sees volunteers from the UK working alongside volunteers from the developing world. ICS works with projects that have specifically requested help, with emphasis placed on measures that combat poverty. Funded by the Department for International Development, ICS is led by VSO, in partnership with a number of development organisations. Prime Minister David Cameron has said the program was inspired by the Peace Corps. The forerunner programme to ICS was Platform2, which was initiated under the previous Labour government. ICS and ICS Entrepreneur are led by VSO in partnership with a group of development organisations. Volunteers to the ICS are asked to fundraise, and receive support to help them meet their fundraising goals. ICS consortium The ICS consortium are a group of organisations that aim to use their experience in running overseas volunteer programmes to work towards the Millennium Development Goals. Collectively, the ICS agencies work directly with around 3000 international volunteers every year and have partnerships in over 60 countries. Criticisms The International Citizen Service was criticized for a lack of value and basically providing holidays on taxpayers expense. Questions have been raised as to whether the cost of ¬£7,633 per volunteer for the flights, visas, accommodation, food, insurance, a certain amount of living expenses and training of young people offers good value for money. The same report showed however that those volunteers raised ¬£2.148 million to support the programmes during that period which covered the majority of that cost.

The males of A. maculosum differ from most other males of bee species because the males are significantly larger than females. In addition, subordinate males that act as satellites are smaller than territory- owning males.Frohlich, Donald R., and Frank D. Parker. \\"Observations on the nest-building and reproductive behavior of a resin-gathering bee: Dianthidium ulkei (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae).\\" Annals of the Entomological Society of America 78.6 (1985): 804-810. This species can be found predominately in Mexico and the United States. Taxonomy and phylogeny A. maculosum belongs to the subfamily Megachilinae within the hymenopteran family Megachilidae. Megachilinae is divided into 5 tribes: Anthidiini, Dioxyini, Lithurgini, Megachilini, and Osmiini. The genus Anthidium, composed of carder bees, has 92 species of bees. Anthidium is part of the tribe Anthidiini, which is one of the most diverse genera of the family Megachilidae. Distribution The distribution of A. maculosum ranges in Middle America and North America. These bees are most commonly found in Mexico and the United States.Moure's Bee Catalogue Description and identification The middle tibia of A. maculosum shows apical spines.Michener, Charles Duncan. The Bees of the World. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins UP, 2000. Print. Body sizes of these bees seem to correlate with head-widths. Therefore, a bigger head is correlated with a bigger body size. The body sizes of territorial and non-territorial bees are different. Territorial males have larger body sizes and thus correlate with holding territory, while the non-territorial bees are smaller. This smaller size is indicative of them being subordinate. In addition, males are larger than females, which is common in the family Megachilidae. However, this is rare in other bee families where the female is normally larger than the drone or male. A. maculosum nests are built in holes excavated in wood. Colony cycle Female solitary bees lay their eggs continuously during the breeding season. They deposit their eggs right before they close their brood cells.Lampert, Kathrin P., et al. \\"‚ÄòLate‚Äômale sperm precedence in polyandrous wool-carder bees and the evolution of male resource defence in Hymenoptera.\\" Animal Behaviour 90 (2014): 211-217. These carder bees are diurnal and are active only when the temperatures are above freezing. Moreover, these bees are most active when there are plenty of resources such as flowers, from which they can extract pollen and nectar.Griswold, Terry, Victor H. Gonzalez, and Harold Ikerd. \\"AnthWest, occurrence records for wool carder bees of the genus Anthidium (Hymenoptera, Megachilidae, Anthidiini) in the Western Hemisphere.\\" ZooKeys 408 (2014): 31. Being solitary bees, this species does not build colonies or store honey.\\"How to Manage Alfalfa Leafcutting Bees\\", a publication of the University of Maine Agricultural Cooperative Extension, year 2007. Generally, these bees live for around a year. Most of this time is spent in the nest until they become adults where they are seen outside the nest for three to four weeks. Prior to its adult stage, this solitary bee goes through the stages of being an egg until it progresses to the larva stage and afterward the pupa stage in the brood cell.\\"To Protect Invertebrates!\\" The Xerces Society ¬ª Native Bee Biology. N.p., n.d. Web. 05 Nov. 2015.  Diet  The females of A. maculosum collect pollen and nectar from Monarda pectinata, a flowering mint plant. Therefore, males aggregate and hold territory around these resources to ensure they copulate. This species of bee also lands on Monarda austromontana.Oliveira, Reisla, Airton Torres Carvalho, and Clemens Schlindwein. \\"Territorial or wandering: how males of Protodiscelis palpalis (Colletidae, Paracolletinae) behave in searching for mates.\\" Apidologie 43.6 (2012): 674-684. Other plants that A. maculosum have been seen to collect pollen and nectar from in the United States include Ballota pseudodictamnus, Salvia chamaedryoides, and Salvia chamaedryoides.Zavortink, Thomas J., and Sandra S. Shanks. \\"Anthidium manicatum (Linnaeus)(Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) in California.\\" The Pan-Pacific Entomologist 84.3 (2008): 238-241. = Foraging behavior = Females forage in multiple territories. Foraging males will try to mate with them, and females will normally allow males to do this even though it may be at a cost because they normally get enough sperm after one mating. Multiple copulations may be costly, but females allow for them because it takes more time to resist than to let it happen. Time will be wasted trying to look for unguarded flowers that are of low quality and are rare. This extra time acquired from submitting is used to forage for their brood provisions. Females normally forage in areas that are held by males because of clumped resource distribution, since it is hard for a female to find the resources she needs otherwise. This food that the female gathers is for her progeny. Territorial behavior The males of A. maculosum drive out all flower-visiting insects except for conspecific females. However, if the female refuses to copulate with the male, they too will be driven out. A. maculosum can expect an intruder every 3‚Äì4 minutes. As a result, they are constantly defending their territories but not to an unmanageable degree. They spend most of their day flying around their territory making sure it is not being invaded by intruders. If they come across an intruder, both insects will clash and occasionally grapple. = Resource defense = A. maculosum uses the system polygyny as their resource defense system. Males of this species of bee fight against each other for control of rich clumps of flowering mint, Monarda pectinata. Females normally aggregate on this plant to collect pollen and nectar for their nests. The mint grows in patches, making it easy for individual male bees to defend their own patch. Normally, a single, highly territorial male will defend his own patch, but if the patch is bigger, a couple male bees will defend a certain section of the plant and subdivide it.Alcock, John. \\"Natural selection and the mating systems of solitary bees.\\" American Scientist (1980): 146-153. They also change the location and size of the territory they guard depending on the availability of pollen and nectar, as well as the level of competition. If males can predict which clumps of resources are more productive, they will patrol these areas more.Alcock, John, George C. Eickwort, and Kathleen R. Eickwort. \\"The reproductive behavior of Anthidium maculosum (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) and the evolutionary significance of multiple copulations by females.\\" Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 2.4 (1977): 385-396. Reproductive behavior =Non-territorial males= There are two types of non-territorial males in A. maculosum. One type is a satellite male that stays in one corner of the territory and doesn't patrol as widely as the resident owner. The second type is a wandering intruder that visits certain territories repeatedly. For example, a wandering intruder has been seen to go between two different sites 18 times within an hour. The transient bee might call before he is detected by the resident bee.Shelly, Todd E., and Michael D. Greenfield. \\"Satellites and transients: ecological constraints on alternative mating tactics in male grasshoppers.\\" Behaviour 109.3 (1989): 200-220. These non-territorial males flee the scene immediately after being approached by the resident bee. If caught by the resident male while attempting to copulate, the non-territorial male and the female he is trying to reproduce with will be violently struck by the resident bee in order to separate the pair. In other cases, the resident male will pull the non-territorial male off the female and continue to copulate with the free female. It seems that in general, non-territorial males mate fewer times than territorial males. =Mating behavior= Because A. maculosum is a solitary bee, males do not go and look for emerging females. In addition, because females are dispersed widely, this makes it more difficult for males to find emerging females. He arrives at the resource first and lets the females come to him. The male takes part in polygyny to maximize fertilization because males have little genetic gain when mating with females. Therefore, males will mate with multiple females in hopes that this will increase the probability of propagating the male's genes. Sometimes, a male will emit a pheromone in order to attract a female to his flower or territory.Oliveira, Reisla, and Clemens Schlindwein. \\"Experimental demonstration of alternative mating tactics of male Ptilothrix fructifera (Hymenoptera, Apidae).\\" Animal Behaviour 80.2 (2010): 241-247. A male normally hovers around his territory but when he detects a female, he will stop flying and hover. The male waits for a female A. maculosum to land on a flower and then he quickly charges at her. He grabs her and lands on her back. If he is successful in grabbing her, he will proceed to rub the female‚Äôs head and thorax with his fore- and midlegs. Next, he falls back on the female and pokes her with his genital claspers before starting copulation.Ridley, M. \\"The control and frequency of mating in insects.\\" Functional Ecology (1990): 75-84. Copulation lasts for about 20‚Äì25 seconds, and then the female starts to fight back by moving and kicking. The pair then separates. =Evolution of multiple mating in females= A. maculosum females are known to take part in polyandrous behavior. Most females collect enough sperm after a single copulation, but take part in multiple copulations during their lifetime. On one hand, taking part in multiple matings takes time away from foraging. On the other hand, monogamy also expends time and energy trying to repel and avoid the male. Under certain conditions, however, it is advantageous for the female to be polyandrous. This is because the costs of monogamy are greater than the costs of polyandry. If mating only takes a short time, this can reduce the cost of multiple copulations. It is advantageous for the female to be polyandrous when she is trying to forage because males normally guard resource rich sites, so females get access to these territories when she mates with these males. This is known as resource defense polygyny when the male controls resources such as food to monopolize females. Also, because males are larger than females, they are more successful in harassing females into mating with them as can be seen by the method of copulation. In other cases, in order for the female to extract the pollen or nectar, she has to land on the flower and crawl into the corolla and in this position she is vulnerable to attack by the male. Interspecies interaction A. maculosum is a carder bee that competes with other carpenter bees, such as Xylocopa californica arizonensis for trap-nest sites. A. maculosum prevent carpenter bee nests from being established.Smith, Walter E., and Walter G. Whitford. \\"Factors affecting the nesting success of the large carpenter bee, Xylocopa californica arizonensis.\\" Environmental Entomology 7.4 (1978): 614-616.

He was educated at St John's Roman Catholic School, Rochdale.Corley, T. A. B. \\"White, James (1877‚Äì1927)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 24 March 2011 Little is known of his early career; it is on record that he worked in a cotton mill, and White said in 1925 that when he was 19, he and three others bought a circus in Rochdale, and that he later leased a theatre in Matlock in the adjoining county of Derbyshire.\\"O.P. Club Dinner to Mr. James White\\". The Times, 16 February 1925, p. 9 In 1899, when he was 21, White married Annie Fetton, a worker in the wool industry. In 1900 he went to South Africa to work as a labourer on the railways, returning less than a year later. He became a builder and later bought and sold property and arranged finance for purchasers. In 1908 he suffered a financial failure and was declared bankrupt, although he ultimately paid all his debts in full. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography records that Annie White died at an unknown date and White married a second time, having a son and three daughters with his second wife, Doris. In fact his first wife divorced him in 1921, a Chancery Court case later establishing that White settled ¬£60,000 to fund an annuity for her. The Scotsman, 18 November 1927; p.5, columns F & G =Financial success= White moved to London and turned his hand to promoting boxing matches. In 1911 he attracted public notice when a much-publicised match under his management was banned because one of the boxers was black.\\"The Johnson-Wells Match. Negotiations Broken Off.\\" The Times, 22 September 1911, p. 6. The two boxers were Jack Johnson and Bombardier Billy Wells. White threatened to stage the match in Paris to escape the ban.\\"The Boxing Match. Abandonment In England. Proposed Transfer To Paris.\\" The Times, 29 September 1911, p. 7 The enormous public interest in the controversy propelled White to the attention of businessmen, politicians and press barons; his influence as a broker of deals grew steadily. In the words of the ODNB, \\"White possessed the kind of charisma that disarmed critics. With deep-blue eyes, an engaging smile, and a Lancastrian breeziness, he impressed those willing to fall under his spell.\\" The conductor Sir Thomas Beecham, whose financial fortunes became entangled with those of White, described him as \\"one of that group of financial wizards who appeared and vanished like comets in the sky of the business world during the period 1910‚Äì1930\\".Beecham, p. 142 Beecham's dealings with White came about through Beecham's father, Sir Joseph. In 1914 White persuaded Beecham senior to underwrite the purchase of the Covent Garden estate and market in London. The transaction was incomplete when the First World War broke out in 1914 and public share issues for non-essential purposes were prohibited. Two years later, with the deal still in limbo, White was on the verge of resolving all outstanding funding problems when Sir Joseph died suddenly, leaving a financial tangle that had to be settled by the courts.Beecham, pp. 142 and 181‚Äì185 In 1913, White was appointed financial adviser to Dunlop Rubber and persuaded the company to set up an American subsidiary, which failed. He also speculated in the Lancashire cotton industry during a brief trade boom, to the detriment of the industry. After the war he returned to property dealing, and was at first highly successful, buying and profitably reselling large holdings in central London and elsewhere. He also bought a controlling interest in Daly's Theatre, where, he said, \\"he had used every resource to keep up the standard laid down by the late Mr. George Edwardes\\". White was a lifelong gambler, and spend a large fortune on racehorses, owing stables and entering runners, with some success, for major races. His best horse was probably Irish Elegance, winner of the Royal Hunt Cup and the Portland Handicap in 1919.Mortimer et al, p. 654 During the First World War, he organised entertainments for the American servicemen passing through London, and at troop camps throughout the UK.Obituary, The Times, 30 June 1927, p. 11 Together with other donors, he ensured that boxing rings and supplies of boxing gloves were available to almost all Allied soldiers on active service.\\"Boom in Great Britain\\", The Barrier Miner, 29 November 1919, p. 2 =Financial disaster and suicide= In 1927, White overstretched himself financially, and found himself hundreds of thousands of pounds short of the money he needed to meet two concurrent contractual commitments. He committed suicide by poisoning himself at his house near Swindon. He left a note for the coroner, \\"Go easy with me, old man. I am dead from prussic acid. No need to cut any deeper. ‚Äì Jimmy.\\" The coroner's inquest found that White was insane at the time of his suicide.\\"Mr. James White's Death. Verdict at Inquest.\\" The Times, 2 July 1927, p. 9 Such was White's popularity that more than 5,000 spectators and mourners attended his funeral.\\"Happenings of the Week: News from Home and Abroad\\", The Illustrated London News, 9 July 1927, p. 63 However, the financial magazine The Economist commented that by trusting White, \\"many people in many countries have lost far more than they can afford.\\"The Economist, 2 July 1927, p. 12 Among the biggest losers were White's wife and children, who were left penniless.\\"Court of Appeal.

BGIC has an official theme song, written and recorded by Jane Wiedlin of The Go-Go's.  Name  The use of gay in the company name refers both to the sexual orientation of co-founders Doug Quint and Bryan Petroff, as well as its older, seldom-used definition, happy. According to Quint: \\"If I weren't gay, I wouldn't call it the Big Gay Ice Cream Truck. And if I weren't happy, I wouldn't have the Big Gay Ice Cream Truck. It would just be the big crabby ice cream truck.\\" They were not seeking to be hyper-political with the name; they want their customers to interpret it however they want.  History  Doug Quint was a freelance classical bassoonist, looking for a secondary occupation in the summer off-season. A flautist friend had been operating an ice cream truck of her own and suggested that Quint do the same. On June 13, 2009, the Big Gay Ice Cream Truck began operations at Brooklyn Pride in Prospect Park, Brooklyn.

The RAND Tablet was one of the first devices to recognize freehand drawing, using programs like Ellis'. The RAND Tablet was also called the \\"Grafacon\\" and is considered one of the first produced graphics tablets. The original RAND Tablet cost $18,000 and was available to research facilities in 1964 after years of development.Atkinson, Paul. (2008). \\"A Bitter Pill to Swallow: The Rise and Fall of the Tablet Computer\\". Design Issues 24 (4) 3-25. Web. However, the RAND Tablet did not catch on commercially, likely due to an inertia in user habits which made consumers more familiar with a keyboard device, and the lack of practical applications for a tablet device during this time period. Ware, W.H. (2008). RAND and the information evolution: a history in essays and vignettes (1st edn). Rand Corp, Santa Monica, CA. Retrieved November 5, 2015  Description  The RAND Tablet is a large 10\\"x10\\" printed- circuit screen with printed-circuit capacitive-coupled encoders and 40 external connections. The surface has 100 lines per inch resolution so it is able to digitize in over 1 million locations. This is why the handwriting functionality appeared to be so natural. The tablet connects to the input channel of a general-purpose computer and to an oscilloscope display which controls the multiplexes of the pen position information. The tablet design initially consisted of a woven grid of Formex wires. Each wire has a 0.1\\" resolution and is driven by a digital signal which indicates its position in the matrix. A free-hand stylus would pick up a signal unique to its position when moving over the surface. By the time of the tablet's production, printed- circuit technology had advanced to allow a grid of copper strips on a bi- axially oriented polyethylene terephthalate (boPET) surface to yield a resolution of 0.01\\". This surface was then covered with a plastic wear layer and mounted in a metal frame. The stylus used on the RAND Tablet had a tiny click switch that, when depressed, would send a signal to the machine.  Capabilities  = Handwriting recognition = A program was written in IBM 360 Assembler Language to allow an online computer user to write data and directives on the RAND Tablet. Using point-by-point pen location, the scheme could immediately recognize and display 53 letters, numbers, and symbols in multiple printing styles as long as they adhered to coding conventions. The tablet was able to pick up and identify multiple stroke symbols by analyzing the sequence of direction, end-point locations, and was even able to use contextual clues when necessary. The pen track is displayed until the symbol is recognized. = Chinese-Character Lookup = Chinese Character Lookup was a companion project which used the RAND Tablet to provide a translation aid. The desired character could be drawn on the tablet and when reproduced on the CRT display page, would include the character, its pronunciation, and its identification number in the standard Chinese-English dictionary. By analyzing point-by-point location of each stroke drawn by the tablet's pen, both Chinese and Roman characters could be identified in milliseconds. = Map Annotation = Markings, words, and symbols could by easily be added to maps using the RAND Tablet. The tablet proved to be a straightforward, convenient, and easy means to position boxes, lines, arrows, text, and other annotations over the display map. Digitally scanned maps were believed to be provided by the Defense Intelligence Agency and the USAF R&D; facility at the Rome Air Development Center, however, they also could have been produced at RAND to interest the USAF. = Videographic System = RAND partnered with IBM to create a system which could merge information either provided by user actions or generated by computers with information coming from other sources. The RAND Video Graphic System serves 32 consoles, each with a full range of interaction and full graphics, and can accommodate up to 8 different input devices. Several computers could be accessed from any terminal. Scanning and buffer storage was centralized to improve performance and reduce cost. The heart of the Video Graphic system was an IBM 1800 computer and a 36\\" diameter magnetic disk to store scanned images and keep the parts of a displayed composite image in sync. However, the system was tricky and commercial development quickly overtook the technology, resulting in the program's termination.

Wakefield Museum is a local museum in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, north England, covering the history of the city of Wakefield and the local area from prehistoric times onwards.  History  From 1955 Wakefield Museum was housed in a 19th century listed building. Wakefield Museum has been in its current home, the Wakefield One civic building, since 2013. The relocated museum was officially opened by Sir David Attenborough in March 2013.  Overview  The museum covers the story of Wakefield, looking at the Manor of Wakefield in the Tudor period, HM Prison Wakefield, Wakefield as the West Yorkshire Police Headquarters, Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, The Battle of Wakefield, Wakefield's writers and theatres and more. There is a dedicated area to Charles Waterton - a pioneering Victorian eco-warrior, explorer and Yorkshireman. Waterton developed a nature park (arguably the first in Europe) at his home, Walton Hall near Wakefield. His collection of preserved animals ‚Äì some made up from different animal parts can be seen. The deadly caiman which Waterton rode ashore in South America is displayed under the floor, allowing visitors to get a unique view of this special object. Other exhibits include an 1809 post box believed to be the oldest example in Britain, a pair of boots which belonged to Rugby league player, Don Fox, and a medieval posy ring from Sandal Castle.

India has produced a number of tennis players, who have achieved international recognition and have made their presence in some of the top tennis tournaments and grand slams. All India Tennis Association (AITA) established in 1920, is the governing body of tennis in India and is a member of the Asian Tennis Federation. India Davis Cup team is the most successful team of Asia in Davis Cup, who has finished as runners-up 3 times. Indian Tennis player Sania Mirza at 2011 French Open. History Tennis has been a popular sport in England since around the 1880s when the British Army and Civilian Officers brought the game to India. Soon after regular tournaments like the 'Punjab Lawn tennis Championship' at Lahore (Now in Pakistan) (1885); 'Bengal Lawn Tennis Championship' at Calcutta (now Kolkata) (1887) and the 'All India Tennis Championships' at Allahabad (1910) were organised. In the history of major tournaments, India has already beaten among others France, Romania, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Greece in Davis Cup ties (1921 to 1929). The history of tennis in India goes back a long way. In the 1880s, the Britishers introduced the game of tennis in India during the colonial rule and soon it started gaining momentum. BK Nehru in 1905 and Sardar Nihal Singh in 1908 were later joined by M Saleem, Fayzee brothers and Jagat Mohan Lal who made it to last 16 stages at the Wimbledon. Ghaus Mohammad was the first Indian to reach the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 1939 where he lost to American champion Bobby Riggs. According to the All India Tennis Association, in Davis Cup ties between 1921 and 1929, India beat, among others, France, Romania, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Greece. Top Indian players like Saleem, Fayzee brothers, Cotah Ramaswamy and Krishna Prasad beat a large number of ranked European players and teams to bring glory to the nation. In the 1960s, the sport witnessed a golden era. Ramanathan Krishnan earned his highest seeding ‚Äì No. 4 in Wimbledon in 1962. In the Davis Cup, India repeatedly became the Zonal Champions. Ramanathan Krishnan, along with Premjit Lal, SP Misra, Jaidip and RK Khanna as the non-playing captain, steered India to the Cup finals in 1966. They lost the Cup but not before Krishnan and J Mukerjea beat Newcombe and Tony Roche, the Wimbledon champions, (1965) in doubles. In the 1970s, Vijay Amritraj burst onto the scene. With teammates Sashi Menon, Jasjit Singh and brother Anand Amritraj, Vijay took India to World Cup Finals for the second time in 1974. Vijay also made it to the quarterfinals of US Open in 1973 and 1981; and Wimbledon in 1973 and 1974. Ramesh Krishnan, the son of Ramanathan Krishnan, won the junior Wimbledon championship and junior French Open title in 1979 and was ranked number 1 junior in the world. He made it to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon (1986) and US Open (twice). The 1990s saw the rise of Leander Paes who won the bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1997, Mahesh Bhupati became India's first ever grand slam winner when he won the mixed doubles at French Open. Paes partnered with Bhupati to reach the finals of all four grand slams in 1999, winning twohttps://frontline.thehindu.com/static/html/fl1613/16131280.htm. In the 2000s and 2010s, playing separately or together, Paes and Bhupati won several grand slam doubles and mixed doubles tournaments. The 2000s saw India's first WTA tournament winner Sania Mirza. Mirza also won a number of grand slam titles in doubles in the late 2000s and 2010s. India's last grand slam win came in 2017 when Rohan Bopanna won the mixed doubles title at French Open. At the end of 2010s, Prajnesh Gunneswaran was the only Indian men's singles player in the top 100. https://www.atptour.com/en/rankings/singles?rankDate=2019-09-09&rankRange;=0-100&countryCode;=IND Grand Slam Finals In 1997, India won their first Grand Slam title at the French open, in the Mixed Doubles.
