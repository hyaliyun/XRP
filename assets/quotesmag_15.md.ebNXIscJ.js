Artajona was commanded for a time by Vela on behalf of the king of Navarre. Vela Ladr√≥n or Latr√≥nez (died 1174) was a Spanish nobleman who ruled the Basque counties of √Ålava, Biscay (Vizcaya) and Guip√∫zcoa. He succeeded his father as count of √Ålava in 1155 or 1156. He acquired Biscay around 1160 and Guip√∫zcoa around 1162. He was effectively an independent prince able to divide his allegiance between the kings of Castile and Navarre. Son of Ladr√≥n (c.1136‚Äì1155) The Vela family was descended from Vela Ladr√≥n's namesake, Vela Azn√°rez, a Navarrese nobleman of Guip√∫zcoa from the reign of Sancho IV (1054‚Äì76). A local dynasty, members of the family ruled √Ålava continuously from 1131 until 1179. Vela Ladr√≥n was the eldest son of Count Ladr√≥n √ç√±iguez, who ruled the same Basque counties with the same divided allegiance. (Vela's surname, Ladr√≥n or Latr√≥nez, merely indicates his father's name.) Vela had two sons: Juan V√©laz, who succeeded him in √Ålava, and Pedro V√©laz. Pedro held the tenancies of Malvec√≠n in 1174, Arlucea in 1189‚Äì94 and Aizorroz in 1194. His son, Ladr√≥n P√©rez, held the castle of Javier in 1217. Like his father, Vela was a lay brother of the Order of the Temple. According to a list of lay brothers compiled in the twelfth century, he pledged to donate to the order one morabetino annually on Michaelmas and to supply it with one horse with a knight's equipment upon his death. His son Pedro also associated himself with the order as a lay brother. When war broke out between Emperor Alfonso VII of Le√≥n and Castile and King Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez of Navarre in 1136, Count Ladr√≥n's land were plundered and the count was captured by Alfonso's forces. On 14 September, Ladr√≥n did homage to Alfonso for the county of √Ålava, transferring his allegiance from Navarre to Castile. Guip√∫zcoa and Biscay, however, probably remained outside of Castilian control. It is likely that the lands were administered by Vela during Ladr√≥n's captivity, since the count's son was already an adult by then. In 1137, Vela succeeded his father in the tenancy of Aibar in central Navarre. He was still holding it as late as 1147, but by 1150 \\"count Ladr√≥n was ruling [again] in Aibar and lord Vela in Legu√≠n.\\" There is a false document dated to 1149, which records how Vela came to possess a mayorazgo in O√±ate: \\"I, Count Ladr√≥n, by the grace of God, prince of the Navarrese, give to you my son, Vela Ladr√≥n, all my inheritance that is in O√±ate.\\" On 21 November 1150, Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez died and was succeeded by his seventeen-year-old son Sancho VI. Although Sancho soon renewed the homage his father had owed Alfonso VII, on 27 January 1151 the emperor of Le√≥n and Castile concluded a secret treaty at Tudej√©n with Prince Ramon Berenguer IV, regent of the kingdom of Aragon, by which they agreed to divide the Navarre between them. The implementation of this treaty hinged on Sancho VI's ability to command the loyalty of the Navarrese: Alfonso had no intention of destabilising Navarre if it proved a loyal vassal of Le√≥n‚ÄìCastile. The young king Sancho spent the six weeks following his act of homage (and the secret treaty) with the emperor's court in northeastern Castile. Present with the two rulers throughout this six weeks were their border magnates, Rodrigo P√©rez de Azagra from Navarre and Ladr√≥n √ç√±iguez and Vela Ladr√≥n from Castile. Castilian count (1155‚Äìc.1162) Ladr√≥n last appears in the record on 23 July 1155 and probably died shortly thereafter. By July 1156 he had been succeeded by Vela. Vela subscribed a Castilian document dated 18 September 1155, without the title \\"count\\". By the next year he had been raised to the comital dignity his father had held. In the last two years of Alfonso VII's reign, 1156 and 1157, Vela signed fourteen imperial diplomas as a count. Although the comital title was granted by the crown and is strongly associated with those who attended court regularly, it was, as in the case of Vela, sometimes treated as a semi-hereditary dignity and could be attached to any tenancy held by a count. Vela was not a regular attendee at Alfonso's court. He attended only when his interests dictated it or when the king's was in the vicinity of √Ålava, yet his comital title was always recognised. Five charters of Alfonso VII call Vela \\"count of Navarre\\", although he was not governing the old county of Navarre created in 1087. In one of these charters, Sancho VI also signs, implicitly recognising Vela's vaunted title. Although Vela was unswerving in his loyalty to Castile during the reign of Alfonso VII, he did hold tenancies in Navarre, perhaps ones once held by his father. Two private documents of 1156 record Vela as \\"ruling\\" over the tenancies of Murillo, southeast of Pamplona in Navarre; Resa, near Calahorra in Castile;and Gra√±√≥n in the Rioja (part of Castile). Another private document of 10 February 1156 cites him as tenant in Artajona (in Navarre) and one of 26 July 1157 as tenant in Salinas de A√±ana (in √Ålava). At Murillo, Vela employed an alcaide named Pedro Jim√©nez de G√≥ngora. Vela continued to serve Alfonso's successor as king of Castile, his eldest son, Sancho III. The very last document to emanate from the court of Sancho III, dated 30 July 1158, was witnessed by \\"Count Vela of √Ålava\\". Yet, prior to Alfonso's death, Vela never witnessed a charter of the king of Navarre, implying that he never attended the Navarrese court except when, as a vassal of Castile, it was in attendance there. In 1157, however, Vela witnessed a diploma of Sancho VI. After Sancho III's death in 1158, Vela initially recognised his successor, the child-king Alfonso VIII, but he also continued to visit the Navarrese court, where, from about 1160, he was recognised as count not only in √Ålava, but also in Biscay and, from about 1162, in Guip√∫zcoa. Evidence that Lope D√≠az, of the Biscayne house of Haro, was lord of Biscay in 1162 suggests that perhaps the lordship was divided, with Vela only controlling the Duranguesado with Lope still holding his ancestral lordship in central Biscay. His rule of √Ålava, was complete. One record from 1161 even specifies that he was count \\"in all √Ålava,\\". Navarrese count (c.1162‚Äì1174) Territorial changes between Navarre and Castile under Sancho VI and Alfonso VIII In 1160, Vela was a witness to the concession granted by Sancho VI to the Knights Templar. On 7 July 1160, 11 March 1162, 29 November 1164 and finally 22 February 1166, he made appearances at the Castilian court, where the regency was being exercised by Count Manrique P√©rez de Lara, who also had the guardianship of the young king from March 1161. During these years there was intermittent civil war in Castile between the Laras and the Castros over the regency of the kingdom and the guardianship of the king, responsibilities which prior to 1161 had been divided between them. The central authority to compel Vela's allegiance was therefore weak. It is within these years that the definitive break between the count of √Ålava and the Castilian crown must be dated. Between October 1162 and January 1163, Sancho VI invaded Castile, occupying the Rioja and a large swathe of Old Castile. It is sometimes supposed that Sancho conquered the Basque lands, but there is no record of military activity there during this time and it is more likely that Vela simply took advantage of the Navarrese invasion to his south to further his own independent position. He must have taken part in or at the very least condoned the Navarrese attacks around Miranda de Ebro and west of the river Bayas. During this period of civil war and invasion from 1160 to 1166, Vela's hold on √Ålava remained strong and he continues to be cited as count there in Navarrese documents. There is no evidence after this period that he recognised the authority of Alfonso VIII; nor did he the ecclesiastical authority of Rodrigo Cascante, the bishop of Calahorra, in whose diocese the Basque lands lay. After Vela's break with Castile, the church in the Basque provinces became effectively independent of its ecclesiastical superior. This would have been in the interests of the lay owners of churches and monasteries, many of whom were relatives of Vela Ladr√≥n. Vela was at the court of Alfonso VIII on 3 April 1173, where he was cited as lord of √Åvila. He is last recorded on 28 July 1174, also at Alfonso's court. Sometime after this and by November 1174, he had died. Only with his death did the conflict between Castile and Navarre spill over into √Ålava and Biscay, which Alfonso VIII invaded in 1175. Vela's son Juan ruled √Ålava until 1179, when they were ceded to Navarre by treaty and Sancho gave them to Diego L√≥pez II, son of Lope D√≠az.

The banded crickets are said to be a lot more active than competitors, and live longer lifespans than the average house cricket. They also have a lower chitin content than average crickets, making digestibility easier. Tropical house crickets are also immune to the CrPV virus. Care is similar to that of the house cricket.

Father Bodkin had an excellent science laboratory that included a Callan battery from noted Irish priest, scientist and inventor Father Nicholas Callan. In 1886, Slattery achieved honours in experimental physics from his university examinations. On 7 September 1886, he entered the Vincentian seminary at Blackrock in Dublin, Ireland.Wilkinson, John P.

The History of the Vincentian Fathers in Australasia. Congregation of the Mission. Melbourne, Australia. Slattery was offered a position as professor at St. Stanislaus' College in Bathurst, Australia. He left Dublin and arrived in Sydney on 29 November 1888. On 1 January 1889, he took over as headmaster and joined the Vincentian staff to assist with the operation of the College. He taught courses in the natural sciences, in particular chemistry and physics. He continued ecclesiastical studies while he taught the natural sciences. Slattery began to amass scientific equipment for the school's laboratories. Much of the equipment and devices he built himself, as he was an expert glassblower. He was assisted by chemistry teacher and collaborator, C. A. Mulholland. On 8 December 1891, Slattery was ordained as a Catholic priest by Cardinal Patrick Francis Moran in the college chapel and became prefect of studies. Until 1911, he continued to teach physics, chemistry and geology. In 1893, Slattery installed gas lighting fixtures with incandescent burners into the study halls, almost one year before these became available in Australia. In 1895, the college acquired a gasoline powered engine, a six-inch (15 cm) sparking coil and two Crookes tubes. That same year the school upgraded to an oil powered engine, dynamo and storage batteries that supplied electric light to the science halls. At the time this was the only electric light in Bathurst. Next Slattery built an acetylene gas powered generator to provide stage lighting for the college theatre. At this time he developed an early interest in colour photography.Smith, Tony. (2009). A short history of the origins of radiography in Australia. Radiography. 15: E42-E47. X-ray pioneer In January 1896, Slattery read in local newspapers of Wilhelm R√∂ntgen's breakthrough: ‚ÄúA new photographic discovery‚Äù and focused his pursuits on radiography.Editor. (31 Jan 1896). A new photographic discovery. The Rontgen Rays. The Age newspaper. Melbourne, Australia. He read of events in Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney and on 25 July 1896 he took a radiograph of the hand of 12-year-old Eric Thompson, enabling the surgeon Dr. Edmunds to extract shotgun pellets from the hand. Before viewing the X-ray, the surgeon had considered amputation of the injured hand.Editor. (4 March 1896). The Argus. Melbourne, Australia.Editor. (13 June 1896). The Argus. Melbourne, Australia.Miller, Sir Douglas. (1970). Roentgen oration, 1969: The new photographers. Australasian radiology. 14(2): 129‚Äì138. Slattery continued the radiology practice until 1911. Local doctors brought patients to his practice and word of his expertise developed. He built a thirteen-inch (33 cm) induction coil, sponsored by local individuals and this permitted shorter exposure times. He radiographed bone fractures along with splinters, metal shards and other objects embedded in the flesh. Slattery realised that the European-made focus tubes with prolonged use resulted in harder (or higher energy) X-rays as the vacua in the tubes increased. Slattery devised an improved regulator for the Crookes tubes and communicated these improvements to R√∂ntgen, who replied with appreciation. Wireless telegraphy Kelso Holy Trinity Church DSC02618 Slattery had a keen interest in wireless telegraphy and in 1900 transmitted signals throughout the College campus. On 10 September 1900, he presented in Sydney to the Australasian Catholic Congress a paper: ‚ÄúThe development of electrical sciences‚Äù. At Bathurst Technical College he delivered a talk on: ‚ÄúElectrical discharges through the air and rarefied gases‚Äù. In July 1903, St. Stanislaus College took delivery from London of wireless telegraphy equipment. On 9 February 1904, messages were transmitted from the College and received at the Kelso Cathedral tower away. In 1910, he published in the College's year book, Echoes from St Stanislaus the paper: ‚ÄúWave motion in ether‚Äù. At the outbreak of WWI in 1914, the wireless transmitter was dismantled. The wireless set that Slattery constructed has been preserved at St Stanislaus' College. Parish and Mission work In 1911, Slattery was assigned to pastoral duties at St. Vincent's parish, in Ashfield, Sydney, Australia. Beginning in 1912, he preached in New South Wales and Queensland at missions and retreats. From 1920 to 1927, Slattery was spiritual director at the Springwood and Manly seminaries. He performed mission work for the Vincentian fathers and toured Australia and New Zealand to serve the faithful. In 1923, Slattery was superior rector of St Joseph's Vincentian Novitiate at Eastwood. In September 1926, as his health was failing, he was appointed vice-rector of St. John's College at the University of Sydney. Slattery performed parish work for the last 3 years of his life. In 1931 he died of heart disease on 31 March 1931 in Lewisham Hospital and was buried in Rookwood Cemetery at Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

Not the fact that the events occurred, but the claim of who did what first, and who should receive credit for being the first in Australia to perform medical radiography. Australia Post decided the most equitable way was to depict all three individuals on a postage stamp, issued to coincided and commemorate the 100th anniversary of Wilhelm R√∂ntgen's discovery of X-rays.

Her trademark artwork blends color, lights, mathematics, movement, science and technology. A modernist artist, Bliss, who was a pioneer of early computer generated art during the 1960s, was one of the first artists to utilize computer technology in her artwork. Examples of her work are included in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Cliff Lodge in Alta, the J. Willard Marriott Library, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Utah Museum of Fine Arts. She also designed houses with her husband, architect and professor Robert Bliss, through their architectural practice, Bliss & Campbell Architects. Bliss was based in Salt Lake City for much of her career. Some of her largest and best known work can be found throughout Salt Lake City and the surrounding region, including her first public commission, \\"Windows\\", a 30-foot mural composed of squares which was installed from 1989 to 1990 at the former date processing center at the Utah State Capitol; \\"Light of Grace\\", a stained glass wall of windows installed at Saint Thomas More Catholic Church in Sandy, Utah, in 1993; and \\"Extended Vision\\", installed from 2001 to 2003, a series of screenprinted and etched plates which are on display in the lobby of the Cowles Mathematics Building at the University of Utah. One of Bliss' major art commissions included \\"Discoverers,\\" a mural recalling the topography of Salt Lake City, which was officially unveiled in Concourse E of Salt Lake City International Airport in 1996. During the creation of \\"Discoverers,\\" tested the attitudes of socially conservative Utah by including nudes in the mural. However, as she later explained in a 2012 interview, \\"\\"I included nudes in a minor way, just to establish a relationship between the ideas and people...Because of local attitudes, I couldn't have the nudes.\\" Instead, she added computer generated figures to the airport's mural at the suggestion of one of her assistants. Biography Bliss was born Anna Campbell in Morristown, New Jersey, on July 10, 1925. She attended Wellesley College, where she received her bachelor's degree in art history and mathematics in 1946. In 1950, Campbell completed a master's degree in architecture from Harvard University. She, who was influenced by Bauhaus, also studied art theory under Gy√∂rgy Kepes at M.I.T. and later became a student of Josef Albers through a workshop in Minnesota. She also studied engineering at New York University. Campbell, who was 22-years old at the time, met her future husband, Robert Bliss, who was 26, at a dinner party in 1947. They married just three months together and remained together 68 years. They traveled throughout Europe after their wedding. Robert Bliss was hired as an architecture teacher in Minnesota in 1954. The couple soon established their own architectural firm, Bliss & Campbell Architects. Together, Anna Campbell Bliss and her husband designed residential homes which incorporated their natural surroundings. Robert Bliss applied, and was hired, as the dean of the Department of Architecture at the University of Utah, now called the College of Architecture + Planning, in 1963. He served as dean from 1963 until 1986, which necessitated a move from Minnesota to Utah. Anna Campbell Bliss initially disliked her relocation to Utah, telling the Salt Lake Tribune in 2012, \\"I was very involved with the Walker [Art Center] and Minneapolis' art scene. I didn't find that degree of stimulation in the art world here.\\" To combat this, Bliss enrolled in screen printing and computer programming courses and studied movement and dance at the Utah Repertory Dance Theatre to find inspiration. She incorporated these influences into her work. Bliss began to lose her eyesight to macular degeneration during the 2000s. She regained her sight through a series of eye injections administered every six weeks for a six-month period at the Moran Eye Center at the University of Utah. Filmmaker Cid Collins Walker, a Utah-based near Washington D.C., produced and directed a 2010 documentary focusing on Bliss' life and career called \\"Arc of Light: A Portrait of Anna Campbell Bliss.\\" Anna Campbell Bliss died at her home in Salt Lake City on October 12, 2015, at the age of 90. She was survived by her husband of 68 years, Robert Bliss. Her funeral was held at the Cathedral of the Madeleine.

Built as a suburb before Indian Independence, it is one of Bangalore's oldest neighbourhoods, established when the Bangalore Civil and Military Station was governed by the Madras Government. Cooke Town is named after G H Cooke, President of the Bangalore Civil and Military Station Municipality between 1928 and 1934, with the Mayo Hall being constructed during his tenure. The suburb, along with other suburbs of the Bangalore Cantonment such as Fraser Town, Cox Town, Richmond Town, and Langford Town, has seen dynamic changes over last few years with large British Raj era bungalows being demolished to build luxury apartments. These developments have resulted in large scale tree-felling. However, Cooke Town still manages to retain some of its colonial charm, and is called the nicest place in the Cantonment by Bangalore historian Peter Colaco. Cooke Town is a posh neighbourhood with plenty of greenery, parks, educational institutions, hospitals and is at close proximity to the Bangalore East Railway Station and the Bangalore CBD. According to Colliers International, Cooke Town is one of Bangalore's most costliest neighbourhoods, with the cost of property being in the range to INR 60000-65000 per sq.ft (in January 2020), just slightly lesser than the Bangalore CBD. G. H. Cooke G. H. Cooke, Esq., MC, ICS served as the Collector and President of the Bangalore Civil and Military Station Municipal Commission from 1928 to 1934. He was also the president of the Bangalore Club between 1931-1933. Cooke was also among the 'Fellowship of Baldwins', who supported the Baldwin Boys' High School. In 1933, G. H. Cooke served as the Inspector of Schools, for Bangalore and Coorg. Location Houses in Cooke Town Cooke Town is surrounded by the neighbourhoods of Fraser Town, Cox Town, Pottery Town, Richards Town, and Benson Town, which are similar in that they were all pre-independence parts of the erstwhile Bangalore Civil and Military Station of the Madras Presidency. The townscape being easily distinguishable from that of the Bangalore Pete and South and West Bangalore, which was under the erstwhile Mysore State. People and culture The Bangalore Cantonment has a large Tamil population. They trace their ancestry to the large number of Tamil soldiers, suppliers and workers who were brought into the Bangalore Civil and Military Station, by the British Army, after the fall of Tippu Sultan. Cooke Town is also home to expats, foreign students from the Middle East and Africa. The suburb is home to Pentecostal Churches, and also includes a Korean Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses congregation. A wide range of cuisines such as French, Vietnamese, Lebanese, Syrian, etc. are available in Cooke Town A study by Colliers International indicated that Cooke Town was the second costliest suburb in Bangalore, with an average apartment with 3 bedrooms (3BHK), costing between INR 30-60 million (USD 450,000 to 1 million). Landmarks=Bangalore Pork Shop The Bangalore Pork Shop is one of the Bangalore Cantonment's oldest establishment, and is located on Hutchin's Road. Its branch called the 'Bangalore Ham Shop' at M G Road at the Bangalore CBD was established in 1928. Milton Street Park The Milton Street Park is located in Cooke Town. The Park is now being improved by the efforts of the Residents Welfare Association of Bangalore East (REWABE). Till a few years back, the park was badly maintained and used by miscreants for illegal activities. Repeated complaints to civic authorities, the local corporator and MLA did not yield any results. Finally, the Residents Welfare Association of Bangalore East (REWABE) took matters into their own hands, and raised funds by auctioning paintings by local children, which was used for improving the park. The Hand-in-Hand Flea Market held regularly at the park to raise funds has gained popularity in the city of Bangalore and gives the residents a platform to showcase and sell their handmade products, arts, crafts and homemade food. Ascension Church The Ascension Church, located in Dacosta Layout, in Cooke Town, was established in 1966. Cardinal Lourdusamy and Archbishop Arokiaswamy helped build the present church, which was inaugurated on 21 December 1973. The church offers Mass services in English, Kannada and Tamil. Masjid-e-Munawara The Masjid-e-Munawara mosque is located on Hutchin's Road at Cooke Town. The mosque has a large multi-storey commercial complex. Attached to the mosque is the 'Centre for Islamic Studies' consisting of an Islamic Library. The centre hosts debates on comparative religion.

It was designed by Hall & Dods and built from 1906 to 1908 by Crystall & Armstrong. It is also known as Maryborough Town Hall. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Replacing a smaller timber building constructed on a different site, the Maryborough City Hall was built in 1908 as the second Maryborough Town Hall. The building was designed by renowned Queensland architectural partnership, Hall and Dods. The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established in 1847-1848, to provide transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1852 the growing town was gradually transferred further north where ships were able to better navigate the river. Development followed and by March 1861, Maryborough was declared a municipality, the Borough of Maryborough, and Henry Palmer was appointed as the first Mayor. Meetings of the newly formed Council were held in various buildings until 1874 when a timber Town Hall was constructed, adjacent to the School of Arts in Kent Street. A Deed of Grant had been issued for the land in 1868 but construction of the building did not occur for several years. During the late 1860s and 1870s Maryborough developed rapidly as the port for the nearby gold rushes in the Gympie area. The new town hall, which was erected for about was opened in 1876. Dissatisfaction with the first town hall was voiced in the local press for many years, and attempts were made at various stages throughout the nineteenth century to replace the timber Town Hall with a masonry building reflecting the importance of Maryborough in regional Queensland. In 1884, the Maryborough Council sought permission from the Queensland Government to exchange the land on which the Town Hall was built with land on the opposite side of Kent street facing the Town Hall, then used as a police and justice reserve. Though this permission was given in 1901 the construction of a new town hall did not commence until the several years after. George Ambrose White, circa 1889 Lack of funds at the Council delayed the construction of a new Town Hall and meetings and business continued in the early timber building until 1908 when the current Town Hall was opened. Funding for the Town Hall was not forthcoming from the Council, but from a local benefactor, Mr George Ambrose White who donated for the sole purpose of constructing a new Town Hall. Although generous this gift was to be offset by an annual payment by the Council to Mr White of 5% of the amount. White previously donated money for the construction of a public swimming pool in Maryborough and therefore he was already well known in the local community. In 1906, work began on the new site in Kent Street, removing the early police and justice buildings many of which survived from the initial development of Maryborough in the 1850s and 1860s. An inspector's residence, stockade and stables were removed to the new police site in Lennox Street where a police station designed by the Public Works Department was being constructed. As well many buildings were removed from the site and sold including a court house, disused since the construction of a new court house in Richmond Street in 1877, lock-up, cells and police quarters. What remained was for the Council to procure the services of an architect to design their new Town Hall, to be a fitting symbol of Maryborough's prominence. Initially it was thought that a competition to be assessed by Leslie Corrie, President of the Queensland Institute of Architects, along with Mr Alfred Barton Brady, the Queensland Government Architect and a member of the council, would discover the most suitable design for the Town Hall. However this plan was abandoned when the assessors' fees and prize money was deemed to be too costly. Enquiries were made into which architects might be most suitable for the work and these pointed to the prominent Brisbane partnership of Francis Hall and Robin (Robert Smith) Dods. The Mayor travelled to Brisbane to interview Hall and Dods and they were commissioned to produce designs for the new Town Hall. Hall and Dods formed in 1896 when Dods won a competition for the design of the nurses' home at the Brisbane General Hospital. By 1906 the partnership was one of the premier architectural firms in Brisbane, achieving, in the words of local architect Arnold Edwin Brooks, \\"an architectural revolution in Brisbane\\" resulting largely from Dods' architectural sophistication and innovation from his professional experience in Britain where he became well versed in both the aesthetics and philosophical background of both the Arts and Crafts movement and Edwardian Classicism. Hall and Dods' projects was wide-ranging and included hospital, ecclesiastical, domestic and commercial work. After preparing plans and specifications for the Maryborough Town Hall, Robin Dods was invited to a special meeting of the Maryborough Council to discuss the plans which were adopted in October 1906. The design for the town hall was a substantial brick building with steeply pitched gabled roof and four Tuscan Order columns defining the portico. The building reflected the Victorian ideal of municipal buildings strongly influenced by classicism, in this case stripped and manipulated with the sophistication characteristic of the work of Hall and Dods. The building was designed to house a 900-seat auditorium, council offices and a council chamber. Tenders were called in December 1906 for the construction of the Town Hall, and that of local contractors, Crystall and Armstrong for was accepted and completion was to be within twelve months. A Clerk of Works, Mr Sayers from Sydney, was appointed to oversee the work. Among the other contractors were Fairlie and Sons who completed the timberwork including the internal joinery, G Horbourgh and Co who undertook the plumbing, Mr Fulsig the painting, and Messrs Walker the ironwork, including the rib and pan roof. Messrs Rolley and Pagett of Brisbane supplied the patented casement openers for the side casement windows. Local bricks from Meredith Brickworks were used on a foundation of cement blocks cast on site. The auditorium was supplied with 500 bentwood chairs from Finney Isles and Co, with older chairs and forms supplementing this seating. After some delays the new Town Hall was opened by the leader of the Federal Labour Party, the Hon Andrew Fisher, MHR. The building was received with mixed reviews, the Maryborough community, as expressed in the local papers described the building as plain and with a quality of \\"red-brickiness\\" whereas the national architectural journal, Building, praised its \\"simplicity with dignity in a splendid fashion\\". The interior of the building was more universally appealing with well crafted internal moulding and joinery and well proportioned rooms. The final cost of the building was . Soon after the opening, plans were made to alter the entrance stairs to a design of George Halibut and this saw outward sweeps added to the stair and plinths for lighting incorporated. The council also undertook landscaping work to improve the surrounds of the building. The next additions were made in 1918 when four honour rolls, made by Fairlie and Sons, were erected in the auditorium. Substantial additions were made to the Town Hall in 1934 to the design of Brisbane City Council architect, Walter Kerrison who was on loan to the Maryborough City Council. These additions included the erection of a clock tower, the construction of a fly tower and the widening and lengthening of verandahs flanking the auditorium. In 1948 a single storeyed extension to the western side of the building was added to supplement office accommodation in the building. This was designed by Colin Tesch. A second storey was added to this section in 1978. The lettering above the entrance door, which on completion of the building in 1908 was \\"TOWN HALL\\" was changed to \\"CITY HALL\\" in 1964, although Maryborough was proclaimed a city much earlier in 1905. In 1971 other alterations were made to the entrance doors to the design of architect, Werner Hug. The most recent alterations to the building occurred in 1990 when a serious fire substantially damaged the building interior. Restoration and reconstruction work was undertaken by Brisbane architect, Robert Riddel.  Description  Maryborough City Hall, 2008 The Maryborough City Hall is prominently located on the corner of Kent and Lennox Streets, in the central business district of Maryborough. The building is surrounded by grassed embankments to Kent Street and lawn areas and formal garden beds to Lennox Street. The City Hall comprises a number of sections: the original building being two intersecting gabled wings, one wing forming the administration offices and principal entrance to the hall in a gabled sections running parallel to Kent Street, and centrally abutting the rear, south-western side of this another gabled section of the same height housing the auditorium. Joining this, to the south west again, a large stuccoed fly tower was added. More recently, a two storeyed administration block was added to the northern corner of the original building. The original sections of the City Hall are constructed from face brickwork with white limed tuckpointing and regular bands of smooth faced stucco. The two storeyed Kent Street section is dominated by a large central pedimented portico supported on six two-storeyed Doric columns on the entablature above which is the lettering \\"CITY 1906 HALL\\". A triangular pediment above this is filled with brickwork and has a central oculus. Flanking the portico are a series of three square arched window openings, taller on the ground floor. The central, first floor, window on each side is lengthened to form a door and a small semi circular Juliet balcony surrounds this. These balconies are visually supported on large oversized keystones above the corresponding openings on the ground floor level. Rising from the rib-and-pan roof of this section of the building, is a three storeyed stuccoed clock tower, with balustraded openings on the second floor and a four-faced clock in the section above. The tower is crowned with a complex domed roof, clad with zinc. Large triangular pediments are formed in the gabled ends of this section of the building, and these are defined by closely space and oversized eaves brackets and feature a central segmented semi-circular opening. Internally this front section houses offices, meeting rooms, a large stair hall and entrance hall to the auditorium. The entrance hall provides access to the auditorium and other hallways through a series of double timber doors, some with arctic glazed panels and all surmounted by operable transom windows. A bifurcating concrete stair commences on the two sides of the entrance hall and meets at a landing above the entrance door, proceeding for another flight to the first floor level. At the first floor the stair hall has a painted pressed metal ceiling. Access is provided from the stair hall on this level to the Council Chamber and a large meeting room. As this area was subject to a damaging fire, much of the interior has been refitted, in the case of these rooms with a reconstruction of what was originally built. The Council Chamber has a barrel-vaulted plaster ceiling and is lined with timber wainscotting to about . Guests seated at a function in the auditorium, circa 1939 The auditorium wing is constructed of similar brickwork, but without stuccoed banding. Externally the section is lined with a series of simple pilasters, and has square arched openings centrally placed between the pillars. Surmounting the ridge of the corrugated iron clad roof of this section is a number of simple ventilators. The interior of the auditorium has a raked timber floor toward the stage which is framed by a classically inspired proscenium archway; flanked by reeded Corinthian columns supported a gently curved entablature. The heavily coffered timber ceiling of the auditorium is barrel-vaulted centrally. A gallery at the north eastern, entrance end, has a curved floor plan and features early seating. Flanking the auditorium are semi-open verandah spaces, to which access is provided from the hall through double French doors. Attached to the wall of the auditorium, toward the stage end of the room are five Honour Boards, commemorating the citizens of Maryborough's involvement in the various wars. To the south west of the auditorium is a large wing constructed as a fly tower behind the stage. This is a concrete structure, without openings, stuccoed with rough cast render. The surface of the section is broken by shallow pilasters, and high level semicircular openings within the shallow gables of the roof. Attached to the northern corner of the City Hall, abutting the entrance section, is a more recent two storeyed brick and glass extension, with skillion roof, tuckpointed brickwork and a modern interior fitout.

History  Construction on the tunnel began in 1849 and was completed in 1852 with the tracks completed in 1853. Work was undertaken by African American slaves, Irish immigrants, and local workers with Swiss engineers. Three ventilation shafts approximately deep were created during the construction to facilitate air circulation, provide additional work areas, and to enable evacuation of steam and smoke from the steam locomotives during use. The importance of the tunnel was recognized during the American Civil War with both sides fighting over but never destroying the tunnel.

Built in two stages in 1858 and 1880 to a design by Ferdinand Meldahl, it was the first special school for blind students in Denmark and was listed in 1977. The institution relocated to new premises in Hellerup in the 1960s and is now known as the Danish Institute for the Blind and Partially Sighted . The √òsterbro building is now home to Copenhagen Municipality's Children's Centre. History H.G.F. Holm The first Institute for the Blind was established by the Order of the Chain (Danish: Kj√¶deordenen)) on 10 June 1811 on Kastelsvej in √òsterbro in 1857-58: Known as the Royal Institute for the Blind, it was ceded to the Danish State when it was completed. The building was one of the first civilian brick buildings to be constructed outside Copenhagen's old East Rampart when the city's fortifications were decommissioned in the 1850s. It was built next to the Institute for the Deaf which had already been completed on the glacis in front of Kastellet in 1838. The Institute for the Deaf had been built as an arrowhead-shaped revelin which could easily be converted into a defensive structure in the event of a hostile attack. Ferdinand Meldahl was charged with the design of the building. Construction began in 1957 and was completed in 1858. The three-winged complex had room for 60 students, 30 boys and 30 girls, each housed in their lateral wing. The main wing contained various workshops and activity rooms. The institution opened in 1858 with 25 students and with J. Moldenhawer as its first principal. The building was expanded with a new rear wing in 1880. Rooms for 40 new students were created in the main wing while most of the workshops and activity rooms were moved to the new wing. A new institution was built in the 1960s in Hellerup's Ryvangen neighbourhood. The foundation stone was set on 25 May 1966. Architecture The main entrance with the two statues The building is designed in a Historicist style which combines influence from Venetian Renaissance architecture such as San Zaccaria in Venice with inspiration from Danish buildings such as Hesselagerg√•rd. The four-winged complex is built in red brick and has a grey tile roof. The two-storey main wing faces Kastelsvej to the northeast. The younger southwest-facing rear wing is attached to the two lateral wings by a couple of low, narrow connectors. The front and rear wings feature median ricilits, the front wing on both sides, all three of which are tipped by rounded pediments. The main entrance is located in the central axis of the main wing and is surrounded by a low portal with columns and lesenes. The portal is flanked by two zinc statues by Peter Daniel depicting a blind boys and a blind girl.

His memoir of life in 1930s Beijing‚ÄîThe Years That Were Fat, Peking 1933-1940Harper, 1952 is one of the most widely read books about pre-revolution China.published on five occasions - 1952, 1967, 1976, 1989 and 2015 He also authored the first and one of the leading texts on Chinese classical furniture‚ÄîChinese Household FurnitureDover, 1948 and put together one of the most significant private collections of Ming style hardwood furniture. An accomplished scholar and a brilliant linguist, Kates graduated summa cum laude from Harvard in 1922 and was awarded a D.Phil. from Oxford University in 1930. An officer in the U.S. Army during World War I, he also served with the State Department in China during World War II. From 1947 to 1949 he was Asian Curator at the Brooklyn Museum. As well as his two most famous works, Kates authored a large number of articles about Chinese history and decorative arts and also contributed to two books about author Willa Cather. In literature he has perhaps become synonymous with the period that has come to be known as Old Beijing (which, although it incorporated features of a much earlier period, approximates to the first half of the 20th century). He has been written about in that context by several authors,Cathay, Fergus Bordewich. The Last Days of Old Beijing, Michael Meyer. A Love Affair with Old Beijing, John Roote also as an important collector of Chinese antiquesThe China Collectors, Meyer & Blair Brysac, p.114 and for his significant contribution to the understanding of the Chinese decorative arts.Austere Luminosity of Chinese Classical Furniture, Handler  Early life  Kates was born in Avondale, a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio on November 27, 1895.The China Collectors, Meyer & Blair Brysac, p.113 His father, Norbert, was an immigrant from the Ukrainian city of Brody.A Love Affair with Old Beijing, Roote, Chapter 18 His mother was a second generation American, the child of German immigrants.The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 19, No.4, November 1990, p.1014, Obituary of George Kates, Pamela Atwell Both parents were Jewish, although Kates was brought up in a secular household. In 1896 the family moved to New York City where Norbert Kates built a successful export business,The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 19, No.4, November 1990, p.1014, Obituary of George Kates, Pamela Atwell selling manufacturing goods and equipment to Latin American buyers. His work took him on numerous voyages to countries throughout Central and South America. Sometimes the whole family travelled abroad together, two parents, George, his sister Beatrice, a nanny and governess, to Chile, Argentina, Cuba and Mexico.The Years That Were Fat, Kates, p.2 In Mexico City George briefly attended a German high school.The Years That Were Fat, Kates, p.2 The Kates family lived in the fashionable and luxurious Ansonia Hotel on Broadway when it opened in 1905 until 1914.A Love Affair with Old Beijing, Roote, Chapter Thirteen - The Making of a Scholar Kates attended middle and high school at Horace Mann preparatory school, then at Morningside Heights, New York, and graduated in 1913.The China Collectors, Meyer & Blair Brysac, p.113 Kates spent two years studying at Columbia University School of Architecture,The China Collectors, Meyer & Blair Brysac, p.114 with an intervening year during which he sailed aboard a Belgian cadet training ship all the way from New York to Cape Town, Calcutta and Melbourne, and back again.The Years That Were Fat, Kates, p.2 In 1917 when America entered World War I, Kates enlisted and served as a medical orderly for a year, before being promoted to the rank of second lieutenant and serving as a translatorThe Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 19, No.4, November 1990, p.1014, Obituary of George Kates, Pamela Atwell (Kates was a fluent speaker of French and German). He did not return home until 1919.  Harvard, Oxford and Hollywood  After a year working in New York City, Kates enrolled at Harvard College in the fall of 1920 to study History and Fine Arts.The China Collectors, Meyer & Blair Brysac, p.114 There he was taught and mentored by Paul Sachs,The China Collectors, Meyer & Blair Brysac, p.114 Director of the Fogg Art Museum, as well as by Roger Merriman. Kates joined the Liberal Club and formed a close friendship with Henry Sayles Francis (later Curator of Cleveland Museum of Art) and a number of other prominent students of the arts. As Henry Francis notes in a letter to Fergus Bordewich: ‚ÄúWe both belonged to the Liberal Club where we lunched continuously with a group whom we kept contact most of our lives‚Ä¶certainly for me my roommate Alexander Mackay-Smith, fellow art majors, Henry-Russell Hitchcock, and his [Kates‚Äô] roommate, George Kauf Keiser; Charles Poletti, later Lieutenant Governor of New York and John Caddington, today a distinguished genealogist; and among other members Virgil Thompson, his friend Briggs Buchanan, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Dana.\\" Kates was a success personally and academically at Harvard, graduating summa cum laude in 1922.The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 19, No.4, November 1990, p.1014, Obituary: George Kates, Pamela Atwell For a brief while he stayed on as a teaching assistant, and then in the fall of 1923 was accepted as a postgraduate student at Oxford UniversityThe China Collectors, Meyer & Blair Brysac, p.114 where he began a doctoral course in the development of French Renaissance Art. His studies, out of necessity, required more time spent on the continent than in Britain, and he spent several years in the Paris archives and on tours of Italian and French museums, castles, and churches, tracing the spread of new ideas in art from 15th century Italy to France.A Love Affair with Old Beijing, Roote, chapter Fifteen - Oxford He had great trouble completing the written portion of his work and he returned to Harvard in 1926 with little to show for his efforts. Disillusioned by the prospect of a modestly paid university position and with having to teach, as opposed to do research, Kates sought better paying work.The China Collectors, Meyer & Blair Brysac, p.114 Through his Harvard connections Kates was introduced to Adolph Zukor,The China Collectors, Meyer & Blair Brysac, p.114 head of Paramount Pictures and was hired as a cultural consultant to assist with the accuracy of European movie productions.The China Collectors, Meyer & Blair Brysac, p.115 In 1927 Hollywood California was geographically isolated and once there Kates felt the loss of his friends, the cultural world of Europe and the East Coast. His work there consisted of selection of settings for filming, props and costumes appropriate to European settings.The Years that Were Fat, Kates, p.4 Paramount was in the process of producing a number of French and German pieces in order to broaden their offerings. Kates worked closely with European actors brought over for some of the productions who spoke no English.The Years that Were Fat, Kates, p.5 He became familiar with many of the stars of the late 1920s and early 1930s such as Clara Bow, Ester Ralston, Olga Baclanova and Buddy Rodgers.The China Collectors, Meyer & Blair Brysac, p.115 Paramount‚Äôs Long Island studio in 1931, the East Coast operations were closed down and Kates was left jobless in the midst of the Depression.The China Collectors, Meyer & Blair Brysac, p.116  Decision to go to China  With no work, and no career prospects, Kates was at a turning point in his life. Living back in New England, Kates began to read widely and found himself enjoying Chinese poetry and even teaching himself Chinese.The Years That Were Fat, Kates, p.7 He considered going back to school, but in the end was offered a scholarship by one of his Harvard professors to go to Beijing and learn the language and culture in situ. It was a strange twist in his life story and after all the work he had poured into the study of European history and the arts and his thorough understanding of European languages, now to begin in an entirely new field of work in which he knew nothing. It seemed to make no sense to Paul Sachs.The China Collectors, Meyer & Blair Brysac, p.113 It was a bold decision, but one that was to pay dividends.  China 1933 - 1941  Kates‚Äô China years were the most glorious and fulfilling of his life. He sailed the long voyage through the Panama Canal to Victoria, BC and onto Tokyo, before finally docking in Shanghai.The Years That Were Fat, Kates, p.8 Once in Beijing Kates enrolled in the Chinese language school and set about the difficult task of mastering both spoken and written Chinese.The Years That Were Fat, Kates, p.9 After a few months he moved out of the school accommodation and clear of the Foreign Legation Quarter which hosted most of the various expat officials and business people. He lived in a succession of Chinese accommodations inside the ‚ÄòTartar City‚Äô which was the central and most historic portion of the Chinese capital where housing was in a variety of courtyard houses or in Chinese siheyuan.The Years That Were Fat, Kates, p.17-20 He fell under the spell of the archaic Chinese lifestyle, which was a world removed from the West and became enchanted with the Chinese houses, their simple, taoistic courtyards, their beautiful furniture and dutiful servants.The Years That Were Fat, Kates, p.54 He spent his days learning Chinese with the help of a tutor who visited him every afternoon for his seven years in China.The Years That Were Fat, Kates, p.30 He delighted in the traders selling goods in the street, with their various ‚Äòcries‚Äô, the Chinese food, and simpler lifestyle. He lived a very authentic Chinese existence, removed from his Western counterparts.The Years That Were Fat, Kates, p.9 According to the weather and his moods he would use his mornings to wander around the many Imperial parks and properties that, with the end of Empire in 1911, were now open to the viewing public. He delighted in the Forbidden City and its many courtyards and rich history.The Years That Were Fat, Kates, p.104 He spent many hours enjoying the Imperial Lakes west of the Palace and the various pleasures that came with each season. It was, for him, an idyllic existence. By dint of extraordinary talent and single-minded diligence, after several years of study Kates mastered the Chinese language. He then briefly attended classes at Beijing University.A Dance with the Dragon, Boyd, p.185 Then he began his own private studies at the Imperial Archives, delving into and re-discovering the world and the history of the city as it had been during the Qing Dynasty.A Love Affair with Old Beijing, Roote, chapter Eight - Scholar He made that his purpose and through many hours studying ancient texts, time spent on the ground examining the streets and halls and temples, and interviews of aging princes and eunuchs, Kates built up a formidable, and perhaps unique, knowledge of the ancient capital and a very substantial body of research materials.A Love Affair with Old Beijing, Roote, chapter Eight - Scholar He exhibited some of this knowledge in two scholarly and ground- breaking articles published at the end of his time in China. In Prince Kung‚Äôs Palace and Its Adjoining Garden, (Monumenta Serica, 1940),Also known as Prince Gong‚Äôs Mansion Kates, who had come to know Prince Pu Ju who lived in the Kung palace, examined the history and the nature of this very impressive and important princely palace and garden.Also known as Prince Gong‚Äôs Mansion It is still considered the definitive work in the English language on the subject. In A New Date for the Origins of the Forbidden City (Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, 1943), Kates challenged and disproved the accepted fact that the Forbidden City dated from the Ming Dynasty, and showed through his research that the palace was in fact founded in the Yuan. Kates demonstrated where the Yuan palace was located and what remained of it in his day. Kates was not only scholarly, he also collected. He fell in love with Chinese classical hardwood furniture which had been the furniture of choice for princely and aristocratic families since the 16th century, but had not made its way to the West, and so was virtually unknown by American and European museums and collectors.Austere Luminosity of Chinese Classical Furniture, Handler Kates, and other expats of the period, were able to build collections of these pieces that were being sold off by families that had previously enjoyed Imperial patronage, but were now, in some cases, destitute.The Years That Were Fat, Kates The simple, Taoist beauty of these pieces, as they were designed and made during the Ming and early Qing Dynasties was surreal. Made from the finest (mostly imported) woods from India and Southeast Asia,Austere Luminosity of Chinese Classical Furniture, Handler they had a gorgeous patina and delectable grains and the craftsmanship was superb. Kates made a study of the pieces, the woods that were used, and how these pieces were used in Chinese everyday life.Austere Luminosity of Chinese Classical Furniture, Handler He built a modest, but fine collection of pieces he could afford, even though he was existing on very modest resources from various scholarships and awards.Austere Luminosity of Chinese Classical Furniture, Handler He contemplated making a business of importing these fine pieces to America with the help of his sister who was working for a leading New York designer.A Photographer in Old Peking, Morrison In 1935 Kates settled into a Chinese courtyard house of his own.The Years That Were Fat, Kates, p.20 In the company of two faithful servants, he set about establishing a traditional style Chinese household. His three courtyard house became the heart of Kates' Beijing life, and legendary in his literature and among his followers. It was located on Laku Hutong in the northeast corner of the innermost Imperial City.A Love Affair with Old Beijing, Roote, chapter Six - My House in China The street and the house had once been part of the various cottage industries set up by Emperor Yong Le to serve the needs of the Palace.The Years That Were Fat, Kates, p.21 In 1941 with the impending onset of war and the presence of Japanese forces in North China, Kates was forced to leave Beijing unless he was to be interned in a camp.The Years That Were Fat, Kates, p.259 He sailed back to the United States and was able to take his collection of furniture and other Chinese antiques with him.  War years  After the War, at first Kates worked on his articles and began a memoir of his experiences in China, but after his latest fellowship ran out he volunteered for government service and was sent by the State Department to Chongqing in Western China to serve the United States war effort by gathering documents and passing along any intelligence that came his way.Kates, letters to State Department, George Norbert Kates Papers He succeeded fellow China scholar John Fairbank in this position, and served there from 1943 to 1945. On his return to America Kates worked on drafting the Chinese portion of the United Nations Charter.The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 19, No.4, November 1990, p.1014, Obituary:George Kates, Pamela Atwell  Life after China  After China, Kates, as he himself admitted, struggled to find his place in American life.The Years That Were Fat, Kates, p.266 Leaving China had been a wrenching experience and yet going back after 1945 was a practical impossibility. He had to satisfy himself with his books on the subject. In 1948 Kates published Chinese Household Furniture (Dover) which explained the art form with examples from expat collections from 1930s Beijing, including his own. It was a seminal book on the subject and the basis for future more expansive texts in the decades to come. Kates was recognized in America as being an authority on the subject of classical furniture, and in 1946 he put on a solo exhibition of his own pieces at the Brooklyn MuseumAustere Luminosity of Chinese Classical Furniture, Handler which was well received and well done. The museum hired Kates in 1947 to be their Asian Curator,The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 19, No.4, November 1990, p.1014, Obituary:George Kates, Pamela Atwell and he stayed there for two years exhibiting more of his own works,Brooklyn Museum web site and some others of a similar nature, but he did not fit in well with the museum hierarchy or the work, and left despondent in 1949. In the late 1940s and 1950 Kates published a number of important articles, through Home and Garden Magazine examining various aspects of Chinese hardwood furniture.Home and Garden Magazine articles, available from The V&A; Museum, London He also gave talks at museums and social clubs for anyone interested in the subject. In 1952 he finally completed his memoir The Years That Were Fat (Harper). The book was well received by critics, but slow to gain traction. Kates felt as though he had ‚Äòmissed the boat‚Äô and that his opus was a failure.Kates, Letter to Henry Sayles Francis 1952, George Kates Letters, Smithsonian Institution But he was wrong. Readers loved the down-to-earth, authentic and revealing account that Kates had imaginatively put together and through word of mouth the book‚Äôs popularity spread. It was published again in 1967, 1976, 1989 and in 2015. It has come in many ways to symbolize in Western minds the period in Beijing history of which Kates writes‚Äîa period fondly remembered by Chinese and expats alike. And it is his memoir for which Kates has become best known. Kates worked on two published essays in the early 1950s, connected with Willa Cather, the 1920s American writer. Kates‚Äô contributions to Willa Cather in Europe; her own story of the first journey, with an introduction and incidental notes by George N. Kates, Knopf (1956), and Willa Cather, Five stories, with an article by George N. Kates on Miss Cather‚Äôs last, unfinished, and unpublished Avignon story, Vintage Book (1956) were well done, if perhaps little read. In 1954 Kates had run out of work and finally income as well. He had a house, but no money for food.Carrington Goodrich, Letter to Fergus Bordewich 1989 He was forced to take drastic action, and that meant selling the majority of his prized collection and getting rid of almost all of his other possessions.A Love Affair with Old Beijing, Roote, chapter Twenty - The Will of Heaven Kates limped through the 1950s with some meagre teaching positions and little income. He was henceforth moving from rented rooms to rented rooms. At one point he was living in New Mexico in a house belonging to China-friend Caroline Bieber.A Love Affair with Old Beijing, Roote, chapter Twenty - The Will of Heaven In 1960, at aged 65, he was finally able draw social security and retire.Kates, Letter to Henry Sayles Francis, George Kates Letters, Smithsonian Institution This income combined with a small annuity from the sale of his antiques and some modest royalties from his books saw him through his retirement years. In 1961 Kates moved to Innsbruck, Austria in order to maximize the use of his funds.A Love Affair with Old Beijing, Roote, chapter Twenty-one ‚Äì The Wanderer And there he developed an interest in an obscure Austrian Princess, Eleanor Stuart (1433-1480). Kates found a trove of research material on his princess in Innsbruck where he spent four diverting years.A Love Affair with Old Beijing, Roote, chapter Twenty-one ‚Äì The Wanderer In 1965 Kates returned to the United States and lived on and off in Boston for the next 15 years. He made frequent trips to Austria and to Scotland, in part continuing his research project. Kates also became a single man at Boston hostesses‚Äô dinner parties.A Love Affair with Old Beijing, Roote, chapter Twenty-one ‚Äì The Wanderer He never married or had children and his romances, whatever they were, were kept well under wraps. Eventually he developed a body of research on Eleanor Stuart, but was unable to interest a publisher in a book and no final manuscript was ever produced.A Love Affair with Old Beijing, Roote, chapter Twenty-one ‚Äì The Wanderer In 1980 while vacationing in Scotland Kates became sick and was forced to return home.A Love Affair with Old Beijing, Roote, chapter Twenty- one ‚Äì The Wanderer He broke his leg in the Massachusetts General Hospital and was left only partially mobile and with no other option but to move into a retirement home‚Äîhis traveling days were over. Kates‚Äô nursing home life was understandably frustrating to him.A Love Affair with Old Beijing, Roote, chapter Twenty-one ‚Äì The Wanderer George Kates died on March 23, 1990, aged 94.The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 19, No.4, November 1990, p.1014, Obituary:George Kates, Pamela Atwell His ashes were spread in the nearby Atlantic Ocean, as he had wanted.  Legacy  Kates has inspired a number of writers to research and examine his life in China and his work in the area of Chinese antiques. Author Fergus Bordewich went to great length to find and interview Kates‚Äô late in his life in a New England nursing home. Bordewich‚Äôs account of his experiences with Kates and finding Kates‚Äô courtyard house during the Communist era form the prelude and the conclusion to his book Cathay.Prentice Hall, 1991 Sarah Handler has written what is perhaps the definitive book on Chinese classical furniture, entitled Austere Luminosity of Chinese Classical FurnitureUniversity of California, 2001 in which she devotes a chapter to Kates and his influence on the genre. Michael Meyer (travel writer) was very much inspired by Kates when he went to Beijing and later wrote of his own experiences living in a courtyard house in The Last Days of Old Beijing.Walker and Company, 2009 And in 2015 after extensive research a biography of the American scholar entitled A Love Affair with Old Beijing, The Remarkable Life of George Kates,Forbidden City Books, 2015 was published.

It was described by Jaap J. Vermeulen of the JK Art and Science in Leiden, Thor-Seng Liew of the Institute for Tropical Biology and Conservation at the Universiti Malaysia Sabah, and Menno Schilthuizen of the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden. It was named nana (Latin for \\"dwarf\\") due to its minute size. Measuring only 0.7 millimeters in size, it is the smallest known land snail as of 2015. It surpasses the earlier record attributed to Angustopila dominikae, which is 0.86 mm in size, described from China in September 2015. Etymology The genus name Acmella is derived from a Greek word akme meaning \\"(the highest) point, edge or peak of anything.\\" The species name nana was derived from a Latin word nanus meaning \\"dwarf\\", and was chosen because of its small size. Description Shell of Acmella nana. Acmella nana has a shell, which is whitish in colour and has a shiny appearance. The shell is translucent and measures 0.50 to 0.60 mm in width, and 0.60 to 0.79 mm in height. In average the size is 0.7 mm. Due to its size, it cannot be directly noticed by naked eye, and can be seen clearly under microscope. It has 2 to 3 whorls, and the aperture opening is 0.26-0.30 mm wide and 0.30-0.37 mm high. Discovery Acmella nana was discovered from limestone hills in Borneo. Knowing that limestone and snail shells are both composed of calcium carbonate, the research team led by two Dutch biologists Jaap J. Vermeulen and Menno Schilthuizen, and a Malaysian biologist Thor-Seng Liew collected soil and litter and dirt from the cliffs. Then they separated the larger particles from the smaller ones using sieves. They put the larger particles in a bucket of water and stirred them. The minerals such as clay and sand settled at the bottom, while the shells, being buoyant, float up on the surface. This is because, although the shells are chemically same as the minerals, their internal cavities contain air pockets. The shells were then examined under microscope. The taxonomic description was published in the 2 November 2015 issue of ZooKeys, and the paper also included a report of other 47 new species of snails. Schilthuizen remarked, saying, \\"Our paper was in review when that paper on Angustopila dominikae came out and it was only then that we realized that one of 'our' species was actually smaller.\\" The main specimen (holotype) was collected by Vermeulen from the Niah Caves in Sarawak, Malaysia. Other specimens were from Sabah. Biology Since the specimens are only the shells, and not living snails, it is not possible to know details of the biology. But a closely related species Acmella polita is known in the same area. This snail eats thin films of bacteria and fungi growing on the limestone walls inside the caves. The researchers speculated that Acmella nana does the same. The presence of an opening called operculum on the shell suggests that it may also possess gills. Gills would be the respiratory organs for their wet environment. Such gills are known in aquatic snails. It is also assumed that the species is distributed in other parts of Borneo, and that their survival is not a serious threat.

It was designed by George Allen Mansfield and James Cowlishaw and built in 1877 for the Bank of New South Wales. It is also known as National Parks and Wildlife Service Headquarters, Post Master General's Department, and Telecom Building. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Bank of New South Wales in Maryborough, circa 1877 The Maryborough Heritage Centre was built in 1877 as the second purpose-built branch of the Bank of New South Wales in Maryborough possibly to the design of Sydney architect, George Mansfield in conjunction with Queensland architect, James Cowlishaw. The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established in 1847-1848 providing transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1850 Surveyor, Hugh Roland Labatt arrived in Maryborough with instructions to \\"examine the River Mary...to suggest ...the best site or sites for the laying out of the town, having regard to the convenience of shipping on one hand and internal communication on the other...also...point out the spots desirable as reserves for public building, church, quay and for places for public recreation.\\" The site recommended by Labatt was not where settlement was established but further east and from the early 1850s this is where the growing town developed. With the development of Maryborough, banking was introduced and during the 1860s and 1870s when Maryborough flourished as the result of the discovery of gold in Gympie, many banking institutes established purpose-built premises from which they conducted business. Following close on the first discoveries of gold in 1867, the Bank of New South Wales established a branch in a portion of the Customs House Hotel at the corner of Wharf and Richmond Streets on 8 September 1868. The Bank of New South Wales remained in this temporary accommodation during the construction of their first purpose-built branch being a single storeyed building another of the corners of Richmond and Wharf Streets. This building was designed by Joseph Backhouse, the brother of better known architect, Benjamin Backhouse. As Maryborough expanded rapidly in the late 1860s and 1870s, a new, larger and more impressive branch of the Bank of New South Wales was planned in 1877. Tenders were called for this two storeyed rendered brick building on 26 January 1877 by bank manager, George Ranken. This suggests that the bank may have been designed by a southern architect. Other Banks of New South Wales constructed at this time include the Townsville Branch designed by James Cowlishaw (1883); and the South Brisbane branch, designed by Benjamin Backhouse and supervised by Alexander Brown Wilson (1884-1885). Many Queensland branches of the Bank of New South Wales were designed from the 1860s by Sydney architect, George Allan Mansfield who continued to design banks until early in the twentieth century. It is thought that the bank, which has a plan standard to many Banks of New South Wales may have been designed by Mansfield and supervised by James Cowlishaw. Over time additions have been made to the rear of the building. A new Bank of New South Wales was erected on the corner of Kent and Bazaar Streets in 1956 meaning that the 1877 building was redundant and was subsequently sold to the Commonwealth of Australia, when the Post Master General's Department moved into the building. By 1981 the Queensland Government acquired the property and the National Parks and Wildlife Service used the building as their regional office. In 1995 the building was acquired by Maryborough City Council who have, again, renovated the building for use as a local heritage research centre. In 2015, the lower floor of the building is occupied by the Maryborough Family Heritage Institute and the upper floor is occupied by the Maryborough District Family History Society.  Description  The Maryborough Heritage Centre is a two storeyed rendered brick building prominently located on the corner of Richmond and Wharf Streets, Maryborough. This intersection houses four important historical sites of which the Heritage Centre forms an integral part. The building is of loadbearing construction and has a rectangular plan and a hipped roof clad with corrugated iron. The building is surrounded on three sides by a double- storeyed verandah, with hipped curved awnings supported on cast iron columns on the first floor. A wide fascia board at the first floor level of the verandah, has signage, \\"Maryborough Heritage Centre\\". Joining the columns on the first floor are balustrade panels of decorative cast iron. Surmounting the columns on the first floor is a dentilled entablature, being the fascia of the awning. The ground floor of the verandah is lined with cast iron columns on rendered masonry plinths between which a wrought iron balustrade runs, also on a rendered masonry plinth. The building has principal facades to both Richmond and Wharf Streets. The faces of the building are divided into vertical bays by shallow pilasters between which there are square headed arched window openings. The principal entrances to the building are through two timber framed doorways on the Richmond Street elevation. The openings on the ground floor align with similarly proportioned openings on the first floor, fitted with double half-glazed French doors. Internally the building is arranged from a narrow hallway accessed from one of the principal entrances at the south- western end of the Richmond Street elevation, in which a timber stair runs to the first floor. The interior is generally timber boarded floors and plaster walls and ceilings. In the original banking chamber in the eastern corner of the building, which has its own entrance centrally located on the Richmond Street elevation and features elaborate plaster cornice and ceiling rose. Many rooms inside the former bank have pressed metal ceilings. On the first floor the ceilings are generally timber-boarded. At the rear of the building are rendered masonry extensions, which have been added over time and are not always aligned with the original building, as is evidenced by a small set of internal stairs required to access the rear of the first floor. The extensions are both one- and two-storeyed. A timber open tread, quarter turn stair is located externally on the north western facade.  Heritage listing  Maryborough Heritage Centre was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Maryborough Heritage Centre is a former Bank of New South Wales constructed in 1877 when the town was experiencing rapid expansion as a result of the nearby Gympie goldfields for which it was a port and demonstrates the growth of the town during this period. The building is part of an important area, formerly the financial and judicial heart of Maryborough adjacent to the early port facilities. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is a good example of a two storeyed masonry nineteenth century bank, with elaborate banking chamber on the ground floor and residence above. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building is a well composed and prominent landmark in Maryborough and has aesthetic significance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Maryborough Heritage Centre is important for its use as a public building for about 120 years. Although the functions have changed over the years, the building has retained an important public role and is now the focus of historical research of the area.

Lotus painting with overlook perspective is a typical example.Zhi Chen (ÈôàÂøó), a Heaven Style artist, commented that instead of painting those floras using regular perspective such as side view in traditional Chinese painting, Heaven Style painting adopted overlook view, which would give people a feeling of looking down from the sky. Besides manipulating perspectives, it is also known that Heaven Style painting uses different granularities of strokes and lines to depict different levels of object details. It mimics digital camera‚Äôs zoom-in and zoom-out functionality in taking video. This approach was applied in panorama long scroll painting to express both the micro and macro aspects.

They usually sit on a tiny plastic chair with a small wooden block placed in front at arm‚Äôs length as a shoe-holder. The shoe- shining kit consists mostly of paste tins, sponge daubers, some shine cloths, shoe horns and shoe shine brushes. The white-collar workers in the financial district are the main customers for shoe shiners in Hong Kong. They stand, or sit if there is a chair provided, facing the shoe shiner with one leg up on the wooden block, waiting patiently for the polishing to be done. Shoe shiners spend approximately 10 minutes buffing each pair of shoes. One can at most, polish over 20 pairs in nice weather day. They charge HK$40 for one pair with tips occasionally. As of 2015, the shoe shiners in Hong Kong are mostly aged 60 or above. It is now considered a fading profession in Hong Kong, which has made the shoe shining industry one of the sunset industries in Hong Kong.  History =19th century: origin of shoe shining industry in Hong Kong Shoe shining first started to rise in the United States, which was the African American men who performed the service for the wealthy white men. Started from the late 19th century, the shoeshine services sprung up in Hong Kong. From the post-war period to the colonial period, the earliest gangs of shoe shiners were proclaimed as ‚ÄúChat Hi Siu Gwai Dui‚Äù(Shoe Shine Busters Êì¶ÈûãÂ∞èÈ¨ºÈöä). A band of seven elderly men clustered in Theatre Lane just across Lan Kwai Fong, cleaning shoes of office executives. Key cutters and cobblers operate out of bright green tin stalls are the tools they need for buffing shoes. One local story about the Hong Kong Shoe Shine Busters goes like this: there was an American soldier who refused to have a shoe shining service, the shoe shiner then poured whitener all over his boots before disappearing into a nearby alley. Seeing his boots being ruined with specks of whitener, the soldier had no choice but to pay for the shoe shining service. 20th century: unlicensed shoe shining business Shoes shining business was seen as a shrinking business in the eye of the Urban Council (since merged into the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)). Therefore, since the early 1970s, the department refused to issue licenses to the shoes-polishers under normal circumstances. Renewing license was ceased as shoe shining was a dwindling trade in 2004. As a result of natural attrition, the number of licensed fixed pitch bootblack hawker decreases in Hong Kong. However, even with the risk of being fined by the FEHD officials, many shoes shiners continued their business, especially in the area around the Central's Theatre Lane, where other traditional craftsmen set their station alongside the Pedder Building. In those days, FEHD officials caught and fined the polishers up to $1,500 dollars nearly every day, while the owners of shops nearby also drove them away. 2009: legalisation of part of shoes shining industry FEHD came down hard on the unlicensed shoe shiners by regularly issuing them with fines and confiscating their tools. Once, a shoe polisher, who identified himself as Mr. Lee, was prosecuted for operating without a license and causing public obstruction with his stall on the side of the street. Later, the dispute between Mr. Lee and the officials made to the news and has aroused many public supports for the polishers. The issue has also moved a Civic Party legislator Audrey Eu to campaign on behalf of Mr. Lee and four more polishers, aiming to fight for licenses. After a series of lobbying and publicity stunts, her effort paid off with a discussion with the Central and Western District Council and local shop owners. In June, shoes shiners finally met the health inspector to discuss the possibility of issuing licenses. On July 16, after the district council meeting, FEHD, for the first time, issued licenses to shoes polishers in Central, Admiralty and Western Districts. Shoe shiners receiving licences including one who operates at the portion of the footbridge in front of the east entrance of the Murray Road Multi-storey Carpark Building at Lambeth Walk, three at the portion of the southern side of the road space of the unnamed lane connecting Pedder Street and Theatre Lane, and four on the road space in front of House Nos. 1-7 Theatre Lane. Each license costs HK$2,500 dollars per year.  Present day  Other than those eight licensed shoes polishers, there are still many unlicensed polishers scattered across Hong Kong. Women have also started to engage in this occupation. These women mostly carry on their past husband's work, and they now earn around HK$8,000 a month. Difficulties Hawker Control Team staff who tackle unlicensed hawking activities always have disputes with the unlicensed bootblack hawkers. Shoe polishers were caught by officials of FEHD. Due to cultural significance of as well as rising public awareness about shoe shiners, FEHD agreed to issue fixed pitch hawkers licenses to eight bootblack hawkers, who had engaged in the business for many years. However, other than those shoe shiners, the remaining hawkers still are not allowed to renew their licenses. Therefore, there are always conflicts between unlicensed bootblack hawkers about where to locate their hawker stalls. Future Most of the polishers are old and some are unable to work due to health problems. Some of the polishers continues to serve the people because they still have to make ends meet. Due to the a low monthly income, young people are less willing to join such business. More shoes stores located in shopping centres provide high-quality shoe shining services. Hence, the competitiveness of shoe shiners decreases.

She is known for her most recent film, Mountain, which made its debut in 2015. It was featured at the Toronto International Film Festival. Her other notable works include Providence and Diploma. Diploma was regarded at festivals across the world, including the Cannes Film Festival and the Munich International Student Film Festival. Diploma was later bought by the television production company, Canal+. Her films also have a heavy influence of geography and location. Yaelle Kayam is known for posing strong political questions in her films, and they mostly revolve around the religion of Judaism. Biography Yale Kayam was born in 1979 in Tel-Aviv, Israel. Before entering the film world, Yaelle Kayam studied anthropology and acting at the Tel-Aviv University. Yaelle Kayam then moved on to study film and cinema at the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne from 2004 to 2006. She lived in a notorious squat on Smith St, Collingwood, hosting musicians, filmmakers, writers and beatniks to her \\"Factory\\" style happenings. This is where she obtained her bachelor's degree. Following this, she returned to Israel and finished her studies at the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School in Jerusalem, Israel from 2006 to 2008. During her time there she was highly active in human rights organizations along the West Bank. Influences in film Not only is human rights an inspiration for her films but Yaelle Kayam states that \\"landscapes and especially cultural landscapes ‚Äì not just geographical places, but also places that have historical and architectural meanings and are still relevant in our lives today\\" have a heavy impact on her life which she tells through the art of film. Yaelle Kayam calls herself a method director. She spends time analyzing her surroundings and immersing herself into her vision. This is seen in her film Mountain, where in preparation for the film, she visited a cemetery, and due to it being a religious place, she began dressing as a religious person. By spending her time doing such things, she prepares and becomes inspired for her films. Yaelle Kayam is also known for her films being politically motivated, and having a central theme revolving around a political question. This is shown in her films Diploma and Mountain through emotional and personal portrayals of overcoming of obstacles that create barriers on people, whether through religion or war. Not only has Yaelle Kayam directed documentary films of her own, but she took part in the Adam Mickiewicz Institute documentary project, called New Gaze, which took place in Portland. Film career Yaelle Kayam has done a few films since finishing school. Her first film, was her graduate film, Diploma. It was shown at the Cinefondation's Cannes Film Festival in 2009 and won third place. Diploma was a short film shown in more than seventy festivals worldwide. Diploma won fourteen other international awards as well, such as the Best Screenplay Award and the Intercultural Award at the Munich International Student Film Festival. Diploma was then bought for screening by the French television company Canal+ and was shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Yaelle Kayam's first feature film was Providence. Providence is a dark comedy which takes place in a small village in the middle of lawless territories along the West Bank. Yaelle Kayam's latest feature film is Mountain, which came out in 2015, and premiered at the Venice Film Festival. Mountain stars new coming actress Shani Klein. Yaelle Kayam wrote the screenplay for this film, and developed it through the TorinoFilmLab Script&Pitch; programme in 2012. She's also participated in the Framework programme in 2013. The script follows the traditional lifestyle of an Orthodox family. The Orthodox family lives in a cemetery on the Mount of Olives. Yaelle Kayam began writing the script for Mountain by starting from the geographical region, which then led to a mixture of reality and imagination, she ended up finishing the script within three weeks. She also spent six months going back to the location focused on in the film, the Jewish cemetery. She also chose to set it in an Orthodox Jewish community because it was very natural to the place, and because Yaelle Kayam herself is Jewish, which made it easy for her to relate and write the script. This is because she knows about Judaism in terms of culture and religion more than Christianity or Islam. Mountain is also one of the films featured at the Toronto International Film Festival.

It was designed by Gilbert Robert Beveridge and Raymond Clare Nowland and built in 1940 by relief work. It is also known as State Government Insurance Offices and State Government Offices. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. Following major restoration works, it was reopened and renamed the Moira Hansen Maryborough Government Offices in 2018.  History  Maryborough Government Office Building under construction, June 1940 The Maryborough State Government Offices were designed in 1939 by Public Works Department architects GR Beveridge and RC Nowland to supplement the already existing state government office space provided for in the ground floor of the Maryborough Court House. The building was constructed on the Maryborough Courthouse reserve in 1940, replacing an early garden between the Court House and Wharf Street. The Maryborough State Government building is located in a precinct of substantial 19th and early 20th century public and commercial buildings around Wharf Street. It was designed to complement the adjacent Court House as well as the nearby Post Office and Customs House. The precinct around Wharf Street encompasses the core of Maryborough's historical public and commercial buildings which sprang from the development of the city's wharves in the area in 1852. The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established in 1847‚Äì8, to provide transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1852 the growing town was gradually transferred further north where ships were better able to navigate the river. Development followed and by March 1861, Maryborough was declared a municipality (the Borough of Maryborough) and Henry Palmer was appointed as the first Mayor. During the late 1860s and 1870s Maryborough developed rapidly as the port of the nearby gold rushes in the Gympie area. The first circuit court hearings were held in local hotels from the late 1850s. In about 1856 a permanent court house and lockup for Maryborough were designed by Alexander Dawson, Colonial Architect of New South Wales. By 1857 the New South Wales Government voted that the sum of be spent on the erection of a courthouse and lockup, but it seems this was not completed until the early 1860s (after the Separation of Queensland). These brick buildings, supposedly the first brick structures in Maryborough, were built on the corner of Kent and Adelaide Streets, on the site of the present City Hall. Repairs and additions were made to these buildings in 1871 but, soon after, plans were being prepared for a new courthouse on another site. FDG Stanley, the Colonial Architect of Queensland was responsible for the design of the new building which was completed by September 1875 when Stanley write a memo about his proposal: > the design has been arranged so as to place offices of the Department of > Roads, Public Lands and Survey on the ground floor as being more readily > accessible from the street, and the courts and offices associated therewith > on the upper floor as being removed from noise and as being in a better > position as regards ventilation. The material to be employed is brick on > stone foundations faced in cement when not covered by verandahs; the roof to > be slated and the internal finishings of a plain substantial character. Stanley remained in the positions of Colonial Architect for effectively ten years, from 1871 until 1881, during which time and with the help of his staff he produced many fine public buildings throughout Queensland, including several Maryborough buildings. The tender for the erection of the Maryborough Court House was won by John Thomas Annear with the sum of and work on the building was completed by 20 September 1877. The former court house was retained at its original site and became used as a quarters for police and was demolished to make way for the construction of the new Town Hall in 1908. The Maryborough Court House was a large two storeyed building, designed to house the offices of several government departments on the ground floor and the court room and ancillary facilities above. The building was sited overlooking Queen's Park and addressing both Wharf and Richmond Streets. Between Wharf Street and the courthouse a garden was established which enhanced the building's garden setting. The ground floor of the courthouse provided offices for government departments. However, more floor space was needed and therefore the decision was made to erect a new Government Offices Building, in line with government policy for encouraging capital works in the 1930s to overcome the effect of the Great Depression. The Government Offices Building was designed by the Department of Public Works and two staff members seem to have been involved on the project. Two drawings of the proposed building were prepared. The first set was drawn by GR Beveridge and included elevations, ceiling and roof plans and general layouts of the site and the other, by RC Nowland is a detailed floor plan. The Government Offices Building impacted on the courthouse as the courthouse gardens were sacrified to provide the space for the new building. However, as the construction of the new offices solved problems of space in the courthouse, the courthouse was remodelled internally at the same time. The Maryborough Government Offices Building continues to house Queensland Government Departments and displays much of its original design and fittings.  Description  The Maryborough Government Office Building is a substantial rendered brick building prominently located on the corner of Wharf and Richmond Streets, alongside the Court House. The building is designed to complement the proportions and massing of the Court House. The building has a rectangular plan with a corrugated fibrous cement hipped roof over the body of the building, with hipped sections over the two bays at either end of the building. The corrugated fibrous- cement roof tiles simulate the appearance of terracotta tiles. The overhanging eaves of the roof are supported on moulded corbels which provide a decorative line around the cornice of the building. The symmetrically composed Wharf Street facade of the Government Offices is divided into three bays, comprising the central portion and side wings. The ground floor of the building displays rendered stone coursing and is lined with a number of round arched window openings. Centrally projecting from the ground floor Wharf Street facade is a one storeyed entrance vestibule. This continues the ground floor stone coursing and has a centrally located round arched entrance which is surrounded by relief rendered quoining and an arched fanlight above. The central doorway is surmounted by a rectangular keystone which displays in relief the name \\"Maryborough Government Office Building\\". The upper floor of the building is lined with rectangular window openings glazed with six panelled vertical sash windows. The side wings at either end of the building principally house the internal stairs and are distinguished externally by a central arched doorway to the street. The wings are stepped-back from the front facade of the building and flank the central core in symmetry. The interior of the building comprises two levels which display much of the original fittings and joinery. The entrance to the lower floor leads into a large reception area which features a decorative terrazzo floor and large solid timber service counter. From this public space, the open-plan central office space can be seen and is accessed by a passage to the side of the counter. The central office area features decorative plaster coffered ceilings. Located in the north-east corner of the ground floor is a records room adjoining a strong room which were part of the original plans. The strong room still displays its iron door, however both rooms are used for storage. In the south-east corner of the ground floor is a private office, originally the manager's office, which has original parquetry floors and timber panelled walls. This plan is replicated at the south-west corner of the ground floor, however this room does not display the same quality finishes. The north-west corner of the ground floor contains a separate room which was originally used at the typists' room. Extending outward from the central open office space are two passageways which lead to stairways located in the side wings. The staircases and lower ground landings are intact and display terrazo flooring and steps with decorative rectangular cast-iron balustrade panels of a modern design consisting of three upright bars, the cental bar being a barley-twist. The handrails and upright posts are of timber. The ground floor landings also give access to Wharf Street via a double set of doors, the inner doors being French doors with six-panelled glass panes and the outer door of solid timber with surmounting fanlight. These landings also display original timber directory boards with glass panes. The upper floor consists of numerous offices which flank either side of a narrow hall which runs the length of the central core of the building. This floor is characterised by its high quality timber features namely office doors and joinery and externally studded ceilings in a grid pattern. Toilets are located at either end of the upper floor, in the side wings. The rear of the building, the northern face, fronts onto a landscaped pedestrian walkway which runs between the government offices and the courthouse. The walkway contains a recently completed mosaic ground mural in commemoration of the centenary of Federation.  Heritage listing  Maryborough Government Offices Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Constructed in 1940, the Maryborough Government Offices Building is important in demonstrating the continued role of the city of Maryborough as a regional administration centre which developed from its significant position as a major Port of Entry since the 1850s. The building is also an example of construction work carried out under the unemployment relief scheme instigated by the State Government during the depression of the 1930s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Maryborough Government Offices Building is a good representative example of the Inter-War Georgian Revival style and is typical of the high standard of public buildings designed by the Queensland State Government Architects in this style prior to the Second World War. Other examples of this type of building include the Innisfail and Mackay Court Houses and the Government Offices in Cairns and Townsville. The intact interior design features such as the strong room, the individual offices and the high quality of finishes also demonstrate the workings of state government administration at the time of construction. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building is an important component of the Wharf Street precinct which comprises predominantly substantial commercial and public buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries which developed near the busy trading centre of the Mary River wharves and now present a coherent character throughout the area. The building complements other buildings in the Wharf Street precinct, particularly the adjacent Court House to which it is harmonious in scale and form, making a significant contribution to the townscape. The form, scale and fabric of the building illustrate a skilled design approach, and the detailing of the materials and finishes exhibit fine quality craftsmanship. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Maryborough Government Offices Building has special association with the work of the Queensland Works Department as a good example of their inter-war work throughout the State.

Early life and military career Pranoto was born in Bagelen, Purworejo, Central Java, the ninth of ten children. He completed his elementary education in 1937 and studied at the Muhammadiyah Dutch middle school in Yogyakarta until 1940. He then studied to be a teacher, graduating in 1943, after which he decided to join the PETA militia, which had been established by the Japanese forces then occupying the Dutch East Indies. During his training, he met and became a close friend of fellow cadet future Indonesian president Suharto. He moved up through the ranks, and fought in the Indonesian War of Independence. He graduated from the Indonesian Army Commando Staff School in 1957, and occupied a number of posts, including commander of the Dipenogoro Area Military Command from 1959 - 1961, replacing Suharto, who Pranoto had reported to Army headquarters for his business activities. From 1962 to 1965 he was third assistant to the Minister/Commander of the Army, Ahmad Yani. with the rank of major general. End of military career On the night of 30 September 1965, a group calling itself the 30 September Movement attempted to arrest a number of senior army generals, including Minister/Commander of the Army Ahmad Yani, who was killed when he refused to accompany the soldiers who came to his house to detain him. The following day, while troops allied to the movement were still in control of central Jakarta, President Sukarno went to Halim Air force Base, which the group was using as its headquarters, although he claimed that this was so he could be near an aircraft if he needed to escape. There he was informed of the kidnappings of the generals by Brig. Gen Supardjo, one of the movement's leaders. After hearing from another general, Subur, that Yani might have been killed, and following discussions with Supardjo, at around 4pm, Sukarno decided to appoint Pranoto as caretaker army commander, possibly because of his seniority and his sympathies for Sukarno's political philosophy of Nasakaom, nationalism, religion and communism. Pranoto was also acceptable to the Communist Party of Indonesia, who would later be blamed for the coup attempt. However, Maj. Gen. Suharto, commander of Kostrad, the army strategic reserve had driven to Kostrad HQ in central Jakarta and after learning of the disappearance of Yani, decided to take charge of the army. He subsequently persuaded the 30 September Movement troops occupying the square in front of Kostrad HQ to withdraw. Pranoto was also in the building, and when Sukarno's adjutant arrived to summon Pranaoto to Halim, refused to let him go and did not broadcast news of Pranoto's appointment, as ordered. Instead, Suharto announced that he had taken command of the army. Following the failure of the 30 September Movement, on 2 October, Sukarno, Suharto, Pranoto and Gen. Mursjid had a meeting at the Bogor Palace. This ended with a compromise. As Pranoto's appointment was unacceptable to Suharto and Armed Forces Chief of Staff, General Abdul Haris Nasution, Sukarno would formally command the army, Pranoto would carry out the \\"daily tasks\\" of the commander and Suharto would be responsible for the \\"restoration of security and order\\". However, Suharto behaved as de facto army commander, and under pressure from him and Nasution, on 16 October Sukarno conceded and formally appointed Suharto as minister/commander of the army. Imprisonment and death Pranoto was accused of involvement in the 30 September Movement, and on 16 February 1966, he was detained on the orders of Suharto, who had never forgiven him for the \\"betrayal\\" of the report to Army HQ. He was never tried, and remained in custody for 15 years, finally being released on 16 February 1981. He died on 9 June 1992 and was buried in the Tanah Kusir public cemetery, South Jakarta.

Typically it does not include a wedding, a ring, a house, a car or a honeymoon. The practice contrasts with the traditional Chinese custom of parents helping to provide the assets for their children's marriages. Naked marriage has become increasingly prevalent in China and is popular among people born there after the 1980s. It is generally recognized as a frugal way for loving partners to marry under the enormous economic pressure China's younger generation is currently facing. Causes=Social pressure In the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, the popularity of naked culture soared in China. Because of the high cost of living and intense job competition, people born after the 1980s found it difficult to have a car, a house, or savings. Many of them have been forced to choose a naked marriage due to this harsh reality. Statistics have shown that, over 50% of the young people turning 30 cannot afford both a car and a house. The skyrocketing house prices make them feel powerless and frustrated. Therefore, they can do nothing but choose a naked marriage. The pursuit of pure love Traditionally, marriage has a basis in material possessions. However, some young couples choosing a naked marriage are unswerving in pursuit of pure love, which they deem an important element in marriage of this period. From the perspective of them, in such a world fraught with material temptation, the key consideration for matchmaking has gone on the wrong path towards sound economic base instead of pure love. In their love philosophy, it is pure love that can stand the test of time and be the bedrock of a successful marital combination. In order to express enthusiastic plea for pure love, they choose to get rid of superficial marital accessories, thus giving rise to the boom of naked marriage. Despite the public's seemingly favorable response to these values, however, there are still many people surveyed who reject the impulse to disavow all traditional trappings of marriage. The rise of self-cognition Naked Marriage can be said to be a product of the rebellious nature of China's younger generation on the topic of love. With an increasing awareness of self-cognition, young people of China grow to see themselves unique and independent with personal preferences. In terms of marital form, their choices manifest their intense internal beliefs under the pressure of external restrictions, as well as their eagerness for independence. In this materialistic society, it is common that the masses deem a stable economic condition a crucial factor of marriage. However, young people gradually come to their own realization that sustaining their beliefs can also lead to a happy marital life. Despite the lack of a house, car and luxury wedding, they believe that, what really counts is to determinedly follow their heart for the sake of happiness instead of compromising to the secular values of the society. Impacts=Equality in marriage Men were previously considered as the \\"head of household\\", with exclusive power over their family. According to social conflict theory, the origin of household patriarchies comes from economic stratification. Owners of property have a definite advantage and men are more likely to have a higher income, hence obtaining a higher status in their family. For China's younger generation, couples are more likely to possess similar economic status and agree to strive together for a better life. This agreement birthed the idea of Naked Marriage, where couples are likely to share the same discourse and decision-making power when confronting critical issues, such as household decisions and distribution of possessions. Therefore, they may attain real equality in marriage. As supporters of Naked Marriage argue, it is the joint effort of life partners that constitute the most precious element of marriage. Challenging the traditions Lacking the necessities of a blessed marriage, Naked Marriage is a sharp contrast to the established Chinese marital customs. In traditional values, a couple can only get married when there is an economic precondition. The word \\"dowry\\"(Chinese: ÂΩ©Á¶Æ„ÄÅËÅòÁ¶Æ) is thus born to describe betrothal gifts from the bridegroom to the bride's family, which symbolizes a man's capability of providing a prosperous life for his wife. In China, the transfer of dowries has evolved into an indispensable process of marriage. Without a dowry transfer, Naked Marriage is tempestuously challenging the traditional values. The discrepancy in marital values is likely to cause family disharmony. Many parents strongly oppose Naked Marriage due to its lack of economic base, while China's youth often have a different idea. This conflict may give rise to family controversy, collision, or possibly even estrangement. This is an era when old and new ideas are in frequent conflict. Experts argue that even if traditions are still unshakable in many Chinese minds, it is evident that with the increasing acceptance of Naked Marriage, China's younger generation is becoming more and more open-minded. Potential problems In Chinese traditions, love and bread (i.e. livelihood) are considered as two cornerstones in marriage. Young couples choosing Naked Marriage appear Utopian since they are firmly convinced of love, which pertains to spiritual comfort, rather than economic and often materialistic foundations. However, some critics think that their lack of material basis may exacerbate stress and other relationship-related problems over time, leading to diminishing romantic feelings. The quote from ancient Chinese poet Yuan Zhen (Chinese: ÂÖÉÁ®π), \\"Everything goes wrong for the poor couple (Chinese: Ë≤ßË≥§Â§´Â¶ªÁôæ‰∫ãÂìÄ)\\" is sometimes referenced in this regard. Consequently, their marriage may be vulnerable or even short-lived, which could lead to an increase in divorce rates.

The school was associated by the Maryknoll Congregation also called the Maryknoll Sisters. Previously Dominican, the current patron of the institution is St. John Vianney. The school is the largest private school in the city of Panabo in terms of enrollments. History=The Beginning (1960-1961) A group of American Maryknoll Sisters, headed by Sister Mary Rhoda, founded the school in 1960. Sister Rhoda, who also acted as its principal, named it St. Mary‚Äôs High School. Initially, it started with four classrooms only, accommodating 60 students. Through the generous donations of her friends abroad, she was able to put up a two-story building housing four (4) classrooms, a library, a science laboratory, offices and the Sisters‚Äô Convent at the second floor. The side fronting the highway was converted into a stage used for the flag ceremonies and other programs. Two years later, Sister Rhoda, was transferred to another place, replaced by Sister Mary Concepcion. This time, the enrollment had already reached the 2oo mark. In succeeding two years, the student population had gone up to 350. With this enrollment growth, additional classrooms had to be constructed to accommodate more students this eventually gave way to the completion of the four year high school course. The Change of Name (1965-1966) On April 3, 1965 the school had been renamed Maryknoll High School Of Panabo, apparently in honor of its founding Maryknoll Sisters, allowed under the provisions of the Corporation Code, Republic Act 1459. Its mother school in Quezon City, The Maryknoll ( now Miriam) College had inspired the adoption of the new name. Sister Corde Maria acted as its new principal, continuing the services and leadership of the Maryknoll Sisters for the next five years. Sister Corde presided over the expansion and progress of the school, as more classrooms and facilities had to be put up. It was during the time that the school earned a distinction of being the leading educational institution in Panabo, known for its good academic instruction, firm discipline and sense of Christian values and leadership. There were two other principals who came after Sister Corde Maria. The Transition (1974-1975) Believing that the school could already stand even without them and in order to answer more missionary calls, the Maryknoll Sisters turned over the management of the school to lay people. Mr. Pio J. Galagala was given the reign as principal, the first and only layman who had such an opportunity. He had made serious efforts to answer the formidable challenges left before his shoulders, especially in keeping up with the reputation of the school. Improvement of the school‚Äôs instruction and facilities had been his priority considering the increase of enrollment. In SY 1976-77, the last term of his office, there were 599 students enrolled. The Return to the Religious' Hand (1977-1978) In 1977, the school was hand back to a religious order; the Daughter of the Assumption, Sister Maria Aurelia Berdenas, fma was the principal whose leadership made possible the erection of annex, five classroom building to 1978. A year after a new canteen connecting the main building was built to accommodate 858 students. The science laboratory was renovated and additional textbook and library references were provided. The Turnover To The Dominican Order (1980-1981) The sister of the Assumption gave the management of the school for some reasons and the bishop of Tagum decided to tap the services of the Dominican Sisters of the Most Holy Rosary of the Philippines to handle the school. The first Dominican sister to handle the principal was Sister Maria Virgilia Rivero, O.P.. During her term more improvements of the school were effective such as renovation of the old building, library, laboratory, faculty room, and classrooms. A mini-auditorium and faculty dormitory were constructed and the school fence. More textbook were acquired to deal with the students numbering to around 1,000. In 1981, Kindergarten classes were also opened as an initial step towards the creation of an elementary department. Present (2011 onwards) The school has undertaken the following endeavors to improve its five major key areas of management and development to measure up to the standards of total quality management, monitoring, and evaluation.Brief History of Maryknoll College of Panabo Today the school has plenty of buildings and teachers. It now has a gymnasium for entertainment, sports and recognition purposes. The 2nd three- storey building is situated in front of the Gaisano Grand Panabo and behind the city's market. While the fully air conditioned six-storey building which is currently occupied by the seniors is still queued on construction.

In the late 1990s Lightwave Electronics produced a Nd:YAG laser internally frequency doubled to 532 nm with potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP), used in ophthalmology. Technology Photograph shows the technique used to mount optics in a Lightwave Electronics single-frequency frequency-doubled laser. The optic in the left foreground is bonded with a thin layer of UV-curing adhesive to a support block, also made of glass, which is bonded to the platform. This design approach allows 5 degrees of freedom for the optic, with a thin adhesive bond.US Patent 6,366,593, \\"Adhesive precision positioning mount.\\" Early products benefited from relationships with Stanford University and other Bay Area laboratories.

The house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 16, 2014. History Located in the Dallas suburb of Irving, the Paine home was a key location in the John F. Kennedy assassination saga of 1963. The house, owned at the time by Michael and Ruth Paine, served as a temporary residence for Marina Oswald and her children. The Paines were separated and living apart, so Ruth had offered her home to Marina.Warren Commission Hearings Vol II Pg 433 Testimony of Mrs. Ruth Paine Marina's husband, Lee Harvey Oswald, was living at a rooming house at 1026 N. Beckley in Dallas to be near his newly acquired job at the Texas School Book Depository in Downtown Dallas. Oswald would visit Marina and the children customarily on Fridays and spend the weekend at the Paine home, then return again to Dallas for work on Monday. After his shift on Thursday, November 21, 1963, Oswald surprised co-worker Buell Wesley Frazier in asking for a ride back to Irving on Thursday instead of the following day. Frazier, a nearby neighbor of the Paines, also worked at the Texas School Book Depository, and he and Oswald would commute together daily to Downtown Dallas. Lee stated that Marina had made him some new curtains for his apartment and wanted to retrieve them.Warren Commission Hearings, Volume II Pg 226 Testimony of Mr. Buell Wesley Frazier On the morning of November 22, 1963, Oswald retrieved his rifle from the garage, where it was concealed in a blanket on the garage floor. Leaving early before anyone was awake, and leaving cash and his wedding ring on a bedside table, Oswald reportedly then wrapped the rifle in some bulk brown wrapping paper and proceeded a half block to the home where Frazier stayed. He placed the package in the back seat and began the commute to the Texas School Book Depository.Warren Commission Hearings, Volume II Pg 227 Testimony of Mr. Buell Wesley Frazier Hours later, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated as his presidential motorcade passed directly in front of the building.

History  On 17 September 2015, the Spanish newspaper El Mundo revealed that the Rolling Stones were (at the time) in final negotiations to perform for the very first time in Cuba, at the end of March 2016 (on 20 or 21 March). The location would be Havana and the venue the Estadio Latinoamericano (Latin American Stadium), a facility with capacity for 55,000 people. Keith Richards confirmed the negotiations with the Cubans, adding that Cuba had taken it seriously, following the opening of embassies in the United States and the Pope's (then) upcoming visit to Havana. It was also reported that the Stones' bassist Darryl Jones had influenced the decision to play in Cuba. On 5 November 2015, it was announced that the Rolling Stones would be going on tour in Latin America in 2016 for the first time since their A Bigger Bang Tour in February 2006, the name of this 13-date stadium tour being \\"Am√©rica Latina Ol√© Tour 2016\\". The tour would include their second ever show in Chile (the first being during the Voodoo Lounge Tour in February 1995) and their first show in S√£o Paulo since the Bridges to Babylon Tour in April 1998. The Stones were also due to play their first ever shows in Uruguay, Peru, Colombia and Cuba. Later in November 2015, another show was rumoured to occur also on 20 or 21 March 2016 at the Estadio Olimpico Felix Sanchez in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic but this show was never confirmed. On 1 March 2016, The Stones confirmed their first ever show in Cuba due to occur on 25 March 2016, to be a free concert, their first ever in the Caribbean and the first open air concert in the country by a British rock band. The band played at, but not inside, the Coliseo de la Ciudad Deportiva de La Habana.

The Sumbanese traditional house (Sumbanese uma mbatangu, \\"peaked house\\") refers to the traditional vernacular house of the Sumba people from the island of Sumba, Lesser Sunda Islands, Indonesia. Sumbanese house is characterized with its high-pitched central peak in its roof and strong connection with the spirits or marapu. The house A striking feature of a Sumbanese village is that houses intermingle with tombs. Sumba Island contains several cultural and linguistic groups, however all share a common architectural heritage. Animism is strong in Sumbanese society. Their indigenous religion focused on the marapu. Marapu includes spirits of the dead, of sacred places, of heirloom objects and the instruments used to communicate with the spirit world. This concept affects the architectural space within the Sumbanese house and the Sumbanese village. There are two main houses of the Sumbanese people. The most characteristic Sumbanese house is the uma mbatangu (\\"peaked house\\") of eastern Sumba which features a high central peak. This roof is made of thatched alang-alang and is somewhat similar to the central peak of a Javanese joglo, although much more high-pitched. The biggest peaked-house of Sumbanese people is known as uma bungguru (Sumbanese \\"house of the fellowship\\"). The house is the main house of the clan where important rituals relating with the unity of the clan are held, e.g. wedding ceremonies, funeral, and so on. The big house is also the permanent residence of the oldest person of the village. Other type of house is uma kamadungu (\\"bald house\\") which contains no central peak. The peak-less house is considered not 'hot' for a ritual, and so they are also known uma maringu or \\"cool house\\". A basic Sumbanese house has a square layout. This layout can be as small as 5 x 5 meter of as big as 15 x 15 meter. Four main posts supported the roof peak of a house, these posts are imbued with mystical symbolism. A Sumbanese house can accommodate a single family or several extended families. Two entrance accesses are positioned to the left and right of the house. There is no window in a Sumbanese house, cross ventilation is provided from small openings in the wall, which is made of plaited palm boughs, areca sheath, or ‚Äì among the very rich ‚Äì buffalo hide. Buffalo horns often decorate the walls, a reminder to past sacrifice. Traditional Sumbanese village is typically located on elevated sites, with houses (uma) forming two or more rows on either side of a central plaza. The central plaza is aligned north-south and contains megalithic tombs and other sacred objects, the overall impact is that the houses of Sumba people intermingles with the tombs. Construction Construction of a Sumbanese house. The Sumbanese clan house is largely a timber and bamboo constructions, bamboo being more used on the western side of Sumba Island than on the east. Tree trunks constitute the four principal house posts and other load bearing elements. Only certain hardwoods are reserved for the construction of special ancestral houses (uma marapu). Walls are made from panels of plaited bamboo, or woven coconut leaf. Whole bamboo culms constitute the floor. The roof is made of a dense thatch of alang-alang grass, tied with coconut leaf to battens made from saplings. Layout and marapu The left front post of a Sumbanese house is visible here complete with the special aperture where women passed rice to be offered to the marapu. The space within a Sumbanese house is divided into three: the upper space, the middle space, and the lower space. The upper space (roughly the high-pitched peak roof area) is where sacred heirlooms are stored. This upper space is where the marapu resides. Food offerings and other rituals addressed to the ancestors are held in the upper space. Only older men are permitted to enter this otherwise empty part of the building, and even this is a rare occasion. The middle space of a Sumbanese house is where mundane activity is held, while the lower space (the space below the house) is where livestock, such as chicken and pig, are kept. Another division of space is using the concept of right or left space (seen from outside the front facade). The space on the right is considered masculine, while the left is feminine. The right side of the house, called the \\"big (major) house floor\\" (kaheli bokulu) is largely reserved for ritual and other public affairs conducted by men. The left side of the house is named the \\"cool house floor\\" (kaheli maringu); and is associated with female domestic activities, such as preparing a meal, dining, and sleeping (simple compartments for sleeping are built along the left wall). In the Sumbanese society, women are considered \\"owners of houses\\" (mangu umangu) because they spend more time at home than men. On the other hand, men are associated with the exterior and with external relation among clans as well as communication with the spiritual being. Similarly, the door on the right front is reserved for male access, while the one on the left rear is reserved for female access; each leading to a slightly lower verandah and to the exterior. The right-left and front-back dualities are further reflected onto the four main posts of the roof. These four posts supported the peak of the roof. A hearth is located at the center of these four main posts. During construction, the front-right post gets the first priority, followed by the back-right, then back-left, then front-left. The front-right post is called the \\"augury post\\" (kambaniru uratungu), the name is related with several rituals related with the marapu. A person will ask what the marapu wants and will learn the answer by sticking a spear into the front-right post. Being the most important part of the house, the front-right area of the house is also where Sumbanese people keep bundled mummified corpses. These corpses are placed in a sitting position and facing towards the main (right front) post in the same way as a priest engaged in ritual performances. The back-right post is known as \\"the post that divides\\" (kambaniru mapaberingu) since this is where men butcher and divide the meat of sacrificed animals. The front-left post is named \\"the post that scoops the rice\\" (kambaniru mataku) so called because this is where women prepare rice before passing it through a special aperture to a priest who formally offers the food to marapu in the right front part of the house. The back-left post is called \\"the post that feeds chickens and pigs\\" (kambaniru matungu uhu wei, pani manu), linking the area with the care of animals sacrificed to marapu.

Discovery Prior to 2013, descriptions of dictyoolithids were brief due to the scarcity of material. However, in 2013 the Chinese paleontologists Wang Qiang, Zhao Zi-Kui, Wang Xiao-Lin, Zhang Shu- Kang from the Chinese Academy of Sciences working together with Jiang Yan-Gen from the Tiantai Bureau of Land and Resources of Zhejiang Province, described several new dictyoolithid specimens, including both oospecies of Paradictyoolithus. Description Paradictyoolithus eggs are roughly spherical, measuring in diameter. Their eggshell is thin, measuring only 1.8 to 2.2 mm thick (compared to 2.5 to 2.8 mm in its close relative, Dictyoolithus). The shell consists of three or four layers of superimposed eggshell units. A radial cross section of the eggshell reveals the net-like (or reticulate) arrangement of the eggshell units, typical of dictyoolithid eggs. The shell units are slender and irregularly shaped. Paradictyoolithus contains two oospecies: P. zhuangqianensis and P. xiaxishanensis. The two oospecies are primarily distinguished by their pore structure. P. zhuangqianensis has pores which all connect to each other in irregular patterns; the walls of the pores are separated into disconnected blocks. P. xiaxishanensis, on the other hand, has well-separated pore canals which look like a honeycomb in cross-section. Also, P. zhuangqianensis is slightly larger than P. xiaxishanensis, but has a thinner shell. A fossilized egg clutch containing six eggs and an egg impression reveals that P. xiaxishanensis eggs were arranged irregularly in their nest. The only known clutch of P. zhuangqiensis is not well enough preserved to determine how the nest was organized.

Initially, it was said he left his home in Tallahassee, Florida, United States, to go duck hunting. After subsequent investigations, he was presumed to have drowned in Lake Seminole, a large reservoir straddling the Florida‚ÄìGeorgia state line; investigators later came to suspect he had been the victim of foul play, possibly at another location. His body was found in October 2017 near Tallahassee, and Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) officials confirmed Williams was a victim of homicide. After Williams's boat was found abandoned on the lake, the initial theory was that he had fallen out of it after a collision. However, a lengthy and exhaustive search of the lake bed in the area failed to find his body: at that time, it was the only known occasion when no remains or body had been discovered after a drowning death in the lake. It was eventually concluded that his body had been eaten by alligators. After waders and a jacket containing Williams's hunting license were found in the lake six months later, he was declared legally dead, following a court petition by his widow, Denise. She went on to marry Brian Winchester, a mutual friend who had helped her take out a large life insurance policy on Williams shortly before his disappearance. Some investigators felt aspects of the case were not consistent with the alligator theory. After years of pressure from Williams's mother, Cheryl, the case was reopened in 2004 by the FDLE. By then, officers had learned that alligators do not, in fact, eat during the winter months, as the water is too cold, and as such, it was suspected that foul play might have occurred. But it did not produce any new evidence, as the potential crime scene had not been secured during the search for Williams. Cheryl Williams wrote letters daily to the governor, asking him to have the state reopen the investigation even though two later investigations were likewise unable to uncover any significant new information, alienating many of the law enforcement officials she had previously persuaded to reopen it. The Investigation Discovery channel series Disappeared devoted an episode to the case in 2012. In 2016, Winchester was arrested on charges stemming from an incident where he allegedly kidnapped Denise, the missing man's widow, who was now divorcing him; he was sentenced to 20 years in prison on the day before the FDLE announced that Williams's body had been found. In May 2018, Denise Williams was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and accessory. She was found guilty in December, after Winchester testified to shooting Michael at Denise's behest when their original plan to stage a boating accident failed. In 2019 she was sentenced to life in prison.  Background  Born Jerry Michael, Williams was known as Michael or Mike. He grew up in Bradfordville (north of Tallahassee), the son of a Greyhound bus driver and a day care provider who raised him and his older brother Nick in a double-wide trailer. Instead of building a house the family saved its money so both boys, who helped by working nights at supermarkets, could attend North Florida Christian High School. There Mike excelled, serving as student council president, playing football and being active in the Key Club. At the age of 15, he began duck hunting as a hobby, and also came to know fellow student Denise Merrell. After North Florida Christian, he attended Florida State University, where he majored in political science and urban planning. Even before graduation, he was hired by Ketcham Appraisal Group as a property appraiser. He distinguished himself as \\"the hardest-working man I ever saw\\", according to the company's owner. After he married Merrell in 1994, he would often go home for dinner and return to work after she (and later, his daughter as well) went to bed, and he sometimes went into work after going duck hunting in the morning. According to his mother, Mike was making $200,000 annually by the time of his disappearance. He and Denise had bought a home in a small upscale subdivision on the east side of the city. In 1999, Williams's only child, a daughter, was born. His coworkers said he was as devoted to her as he was to his work. The following year his father died. Midway through the year, the couple bought a $1 million life insurance policy on him through Brian Winchester, a childhood acquaintance of Merrell who had also become best friends with her husband. Later that year, Williams told his mother, whom he had been consoling, that he would have liked to have $50,000 to take the next year off. Two days before his disappearance, Mike and Denise told his mother, as well as his brother Nick, that they were planning to have another child soon. In 2001, she said, they were planning to go on a cruise in Hawaii that spring; later in the year he expected to travel to Jamaica for work as well. Disappearance According to Denise Williams, on the morning of December 16, 2000, a Saturday, her husband awoke early, leaving the house on Centennial Oaks Circle well before dawn, boat in tow, to go duck hunting at Lake Seminole. The lake is a large reservoir approximately west-northwest of Tallahassee along the Florida‚ÄìGeorgia state line, where three other streams merge to form the Apalachicola River. The couple had plans to celebrate their sixth wedding anniversary that night in Apalachicola. At noon, Denise called her father to tell him that Mike had not returned; Brian Winchester's father drove with Winchester to the areas of the lake where they knew Mike Williams frequently went duck hunting. They found his 1994 Ford Bronco near a remote boat launch in Jackson County, on the Florida side. After investigators with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FFWCC) were called, a search began, but soon had to be called off after a storm blew in. Search The initial search investigation was handled by the FFWCC. Since it had been reported to them as a missing hunter, the agency handled the case that way, focusing on search and rescue or recovery. \\"We didn't have a whole lot to go on except there was an empty boat and the guy didn't show up,\\" one of the agency's officers recalled later, after his retirement. \\"There was nothing there that we had from the scene that suggested foul play at all.\\" Deputies with the Jackson County Sheriff's Office were present but primarily worked in a support capacity. alt=A wooded lakeshore with shallow grassy areas Searchers focused on the of the lake surrounding the cove where Williams's truck was parked. His boat was soon found roughly from the ramp by a helicopter pilot, who initially assumed it was a boat being used in the search. After retrieving the boat, investigators found Williams's shotgun, still in its case, but no sign of Williams himself. The cove is locally believed to have been an orchard before the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers and Spring Creek were dammed to create the lake. It took its name, Stump Field, from the many remaining stumps that protruded above and below the water level, requiring careful handling of any powerboat in the area. Searchers thus assumed that Williams had hit a stump with his boat, fallen out, sunk into waters deep when his waders filled, and then drowned when he was unable to extricate himself. Had Williams drowned, his body would have been expected to eventually float to the surface, making it easier to discover. Investigators assured the Williams family that his body would surface, like other drowning victims, within three to seven days, or perhaps slightly longer due to the cold front that had moved in after the first night's storm. No body was found, however. Ten days into the search, a camouflage-patterned hunting hat was found, but it could not be connected to Williams. Efforts continued until the search was called off in early February. It has since been suggested that the search might have been continued had Denise Williams indicated an interest in such. At that time, the case was still considered open. \\"Nothing in investigative or search and rescue efforts has produced any definitive evidence of a boating accident or a fatality as of this date,\\" read the final report, issued in late February 2001. Subsequent developments If Williams had drowned after accidentally falling out of his boat, his body would be the only one from 80 known deaths in the lake never to have been found. The head of a private search firm that supplemented official efforts near the end of the search offered a possible explanation. \\"With the wildlife around, I would guess that the alligators have dismembered and have stored the remains in a location that we would not be able to find,\\" he wrote in a report. Early searchers had reported seeing many of them, and some of the officials were willing to accept the possibility. \\"Everyone knows the lake is full of alligators,\\" said the FFWCC's David Arnette. \\"You look for other answers: 'Why hasn't the body appeared?'\\" alt=Two men with bright orange life jackets on an airboat in water with abundant plant growth visible below It was suggested that perhaps Williams's body had become entangled in the beds of dense hydrilla beneath the lake surface, and then found by the alligators later, with turtles and catfish finishing what they had left behind. Denise Williams, who had avoided media attention during the search for her husband, accepted that her husband had died. She arranged for a memorial service for Mike to be held the day after the search ended. In June, an angler in the Stump Field area discovered a pair of waders floating in the lake, and divers called to search the area then recovered from the lake bottom a lightweight hunting jacket and a flashlight: in one of the jacket pockets, there was a hunting license with Williams's name and signature. However, there were no teeth marks or any other damage on the waders, none of the recovered items showed signs of having been in the water for anything like the period Williams had been missing, and there was no DNA evidence found to link the clothing to him. Nevertheless, a week later, a Leon County judge granted Denise Williams's petition to have Mike declared legally dead on the basis of those recovered items and an assumption that alligators and other water life had consumed the body in its entirety. The court decision allowed Denise Williams to immediately proceed with claims on her husband's life insurance policies, from which she received $1.5 million. Five years later, she married Brian Winchester, who had sold Mike some of the policies a few months before he disappeared. The couple went on to live in the same house where Denise and Mike had lived prior. Denise and Brian have mostly declined to discuss the case publicly. Later investigations The private search team that surmised the alligator theory had been hired near the end of the original search by Williams's mother, Cheryl. After it ended, and after her son was declared legally dead (proceedings she said in 2008 she would have contested had she been aware of them), she was still not convinced that he had drowned in the lake, but her attempts to bring about a further investigation were unsuccessful. She has stated that she received threats to discourage her. For the next several years, she investigated on her own when not operating a day care at her home. She ran advertisements in local newspapers, and put up billboards seeking information. All the subsequent investigations of the case have resulted from her efforts. She believed her son might still be alive. \\"I get criticized a lot for not admitting that Mike's dead,\\" she told the Tallahassee Democrat in 2007. \\"All I know is I can't stop looking for him until I find him.\\" Her efforts had severely strained her relationship with her former daughter-in-law. 2004 In 2004 the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) agreed to reopen the case after lobbying by Cheryl Williams and a friend. It does not normally have jurisdiction in missing-persons cases and cannot get involved in investigations purely on the basis of a citizen's request, although it can offer assistance to local agencies, as it did in this case. In retrospect, many officers agreed with her that the circumstances surrounding Michael Williams' apparent drowning four years before were unusual, and were strongly at odds with that conclusion: * The boat launch where his Bronco was found, which he would presumably have used to put his boat in the lake, was an undeveloped patch of mud. Yet nearby were finished concrete launches that he was known to have used in the past. * The storm the night after he was reported missing had westerly winds that should have blown the abandoned, unmoored boat across the lake to the Georgia side. * When the boat was recovered, its engine was off, yet the gas tank was full. According to the manufacturer, if the engine had been running when Williams allegedly fell out of the boat, as investigators had theorized, it should have stayed on, with the boat running in circles until its fuel was exhausted. \\"Something sounds fishy on that deal,\\" he said when the situation was described to him. Investigators also learned that Williams didn't usually hunt alone. \\"Some things looked unusual right off the bat,\\" said the FFWCC's Arnette, who had initially thought the situation was a typical case involving a missing hunter and a possible boating accident. \\"Then after a couple, three days and after the weeks went on, those first things looked even more out of place.\\" = Alligator theory debunked = Doubts that Williams had drowned became much more serious when investigators learned that, in fact, alligators do not generally feed during the winter months due to the colder temperatures. During the search period, daytime temperatures averaged around , with overnight lows below freezing. Some nights got as cold as ; a fire was built in a 55-gallon drum on the shore for searchers to stay warm. The water, already at the day of Williams's disappearance, dropped to , and the lake iced out to as much as from shore. In those conditions, \\"it [i]s highly unlikely an alligator would have been active\\" said Matt Aresco, a local herpetologist authorities had consulted. \\"All they are doing is maintaining their body temperature ... Fifty-eight degrees is too cold for an alligator to be interested in food at all.\\" And even if an alligator had \\"defied all known gator behavior,\\" and eaten Williams's body, as another investigator, Ronnie Austin, then with the state's attorney's office, put it, it would likely have left something behind. Williams was and . Aresco considers any theory that attributes the missing body to alligators and any other aquatic animals a \\"stretch ... It would be very, very unusual to have the complete disappearance of a full-grown man.\\" The waders, discovered almost six months after Williams's disappearance, further undermined the alligator theory. While the diver who retrieved them reported that they were in an area of disturbed weeds with an alligator excrement nearby, consistent with the original belief that Williams had drowned while wearing them, he allowed it was \\"anyone's guess\\" as to whether they had been later planted in that spot. \\"These waders, we don't know where they came from,\\" Austin said. Investigators suspicions' were further raised by the waders' condition‚Äîundamaged, without any tooth marks, and lacking any of the residues that would be expected to accumulate on an object submerged in the lake for as long as the waders had supposedly been. Arnette filtered the water in them after they were recovered, and did not find any human remains. The hunting jacket and flashlight were likewise in much better condition than expected, with the latter even working when turned on. Apart from the condition of the waders was the question of why Williams would have been wearing them when he supposedly fell out of the boat. According to a friend who hunted with him frequently, including one week before his disappearance, Williams took safety very seriously, keeping his guns at work, away from his daughter, among other precautions. On the water, he never put his waders on until he had reached the point where he planned to get out and start hunting, following a common safety procedure in order to avoid the type of accident from which he was later believed to have died. \\"As much as he preached that to me,\\" the friend said, \\"why would he be wearing his waders while driving the boat?\\" = Lack of evidence = \\"My gut feeling is Mike did not die in Lake Seminole,\\" Austin said in 2006, after leaving the state's attorney's office for the FDLE. He added that that belief was shared by all the investigators at that point. \\"I would say this is a suspicious missing person.\\" However, the new investigation was made extremely difficult by the deficiencies of the original search, when criminal activity had not been considered. \\"They did not protect the crime scene at all,\\" recalled a Williams family friend with law enforcement experience, who had tended the drum fire during the search. \\"They botched it.\\" By the time investigators began to realize that they should have asked some more questions, the opportunity was gone. Williams's Bronco and the boat had been returned to his family and friends, the footsteps of the many volunteers and searchers all over the lakeshore had made it impossible to collect any evidence from that area, and the items later recovered from the lake had not been retained. Without any of that evidence or Williams's body, it was impossible for police to make a case. \\"[We're] at a brick wall ... pounding our heads against it,\\" said Austin. Derrick Wester, an investigator with the Jackson County sheriff's office, agreed that they were \\"trying to make up for\\" not having considered the possibility that things might not have been what they seemed in 2000. His office kept the case open, and had some persons of interest, although he did not identify them. 2007 The FDLE closed its case, convinced that the alligator theory was wrong, but without any leads or evidence that could allow it to further investigate. By 2006, its cold case investigators were no longer returning Cheryl Williams's phone calls. She continued to do what she could to publicize the case, taking out ads in the Tallahassee Democrat. A possible new lead emerged in October 2007, when Michael Williams's older brother found a photograph and the serial number of a .22-caliber Ruger pistol that had once belonged to their father. Michael had inherited it after his father's death, and after Michael was declared legally dead it was the only one of his firearms that Denise Williams had not returned to her former in-laws. After Jackson County sheriff's investigator, Wester asked the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) to look for it, agents visited Denise and Brian Winchester, now married, in their house (the same one she had lived in with Michael), to interview them. Several days later, their attorney delivered the gun to the FDLE. It was sent to a state forensics laboratory for DNA testing: the results have not been reported. On the anniversary of Williams's disappearance that year, the Winchesters made one of their few public statements on the case: \\"For seven years we have prayed and hoped to find out with certainty what happened to Mike,\\" Brian said in an email to the Democrat, and \\"Nobody wants Mike found more than we do.\\" Rumors were circulating around Tallahassee that a grand jury had been hearing evidence and would soon hand down indictments. 2008 In 2008, the Florida Department of Financial Services's Division of Insurance Fraud (DIF), in conjunction with FDLE, began investigating the case from that angle. Normally, under Florida law, the statute of limitations on that crime is five years, meaning it would have expired in 2005. But it can be extended by three years under certain circumstances. \\"The circumstances surrounding this case raise many serious and troubling questions,\\" said DIF's lead attorney, Mark Schlein. Perry, the FFWCC officer who had been heavily involved in the original search, added at the time that if he or any other person investigating had known that there was a large life insurance policy on Williams, and who the beneficiary was, that search might have been handled differently. It was noted that Denise Williams's court petition to have her husband declared legally dead mentioned only the Kansas City Life Insurance Company policies Winchester had sold him, omitting policies through other companies that Michael Williams had obtained through other sources. However, Brian Jones, an expert in insurance law at Florida State University, told the Democrat that any fraud case would have to rest on more than just those facts already known to have aroused investigative interest. \\"The mere fact that they can't locate the body isn't necessarily something the insurance industry would care about,\\" he said. But if Michael Williams was to be proven dead and the beneficiary were to have shown to have been involved, or if he was still alive (as his mother and many residents of Jackson County believed possible), then an insurance company would strongly consider pursuing a case. By the eighth anniversary of Williams's disappearance, however, the DIF had closed the case. \\"Our job was extremely difficult, and we were simply unable to develop enough evidence to proceed with the investigation,\\" Schlein said. He added that if new information were received, the investigation could be reopened. \\"We have suspicions, but what we need is evidence.\\" Another possible lead that year proved fruitless as well. Carrie Cox, a self-described psychic and certified forensic psychological profiler from Kentucky reviewing the case had identified a possible location of Williams's body. She gave investigators the coordinates of a location in Wakulla County near another boat launch. Cadaver dogs were brought to the area and sniffed it out, but found nothing. Cox nevertheless concluded that \\"we are moving in the right direction... I think something is there.\\" FDLE officials said in 2011 that Cox had not found anything requiring further investigation. Cheryl Williams's lobbying efforts Despite the failure of a third investigation to discern the fate of her son, Cheryl Williams persisted. Her efforts led to the Investigation Discovery cable channel doing a segment on Michael's disappearance and the later investigations in late 2011. \\"We don't know what the smoking gun is, but we hope someone will find it,\\" she said. By then, she had become disillusioned with the FDLE, believing that it was either incompetent or uninterested in resolving the case. In particular, she came to believe the investigation was hampered by the involvement of agent Mike Philips, a friend of both her son and his then-wife. Philips had told her early on in the search that Michael had probably been eaten by alligators, so she had assumed he had been involved in the investigation at that point. He said later he never was and was merely trying to comfort her; FDLE said his involvement was limited to asking his superiors if the agency could help with the search; it did not see a need to formally investigate his role. Starting on New Year's Day in 2012, Cheryl began writing one letter a day to Governor Rick Scott, asking him to either have another agency besides FDLE investigate or appoint a special prosecutor to do so. After she had written over 200 without even an acknowledgment that they had been received, she began inquiring personally as to why. It turned out that the governor's office had forwarded them, unopened, to FDLE's headquarters, where they were placed in the case file. She was outraged. \\"They could not have hurt me more if they had punched me in the face.\\"  Brian Winchester's kidnapping of Denise  In 2012, Denise and Brian Winchester separated, reportedly due to his sex addiction; she filed for divorce in 2015. Brian opposed it initially and had to be ordered to comply. As part of that order, he was to provide an appraisal of the couple's house, due early in August 2016. Denise told Leon County Sheriff's Office investigators that, on August 5, the day when the appraisal had to be filed with the court, she left her home to drive to her job at Florida State University. While she was talking on her phone to her sister, she saw someone climb over the back seat of her car. It turned out to be Brian. He took her phone away and began yelling directions at her. She did not comply until he showed her a gun. She said later that he claimed this was necessary since she was not taking his calls and was blocking his text messages. Instead of going where he wanted her to, she pulled into a CVS drugstore parking lot, close to the door. Brian told her that he was planning to kill himself with the gun. He did not want the divorce and felt he had nothing to live for if it went through. He assured her he did not want to kill her. She was able to calm him down and took him back to where he had parked his own truck at a nearby park. Before he went to it, he took a tan sheet, a different-colored plastic sheet, a spray bottle of bleach, and a tool from Denise's car. After she left, Brian pulled up to her and apologized for his actions. Despite her promise to him not to tell police about the incident, she drove straight to them afterwards. According to a friend of Winchester's later interviewed by police, he had been increasingly concerned that as a result of the divorce Denise would tell the police what she knew about \\"this guy who died 10 or 12 or 15 years ago\\". She had not answered his many phone calls, so he came up with his plan to wait in her car and hold her at gunpoint. Brian was arrested and charged with kidnapping, domestic assault, and armed burglary, with two of the charges being felonies. Denise requested protection orders, saying she feared for her life and her daughter's. After a hearing the next week at which she said she could neither eat nor sleep since the incident, the court decided to hold Brian without bond. Cheryl Williams expressed hope that this development could lead to the resolution of her son's disappearance. \\"[Brian]'s not going to let Denise run around alone with all that money,\\" she told the New York Daily News. \\"I'm praying he doesn't commit suicide, I'm praying he'll tell us what actually happened.\\" She added that she is alone among her family in holding out hope that her son is still alive. In December 2017, Winchester was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the kidnapping, with credit for 502 days time served, to be followed by 15 years' probation. His attorney told the court that he was suicidal that day, due to not only the divorce but also his mother's recent terminal cancer diagnosis and the decision by his teenage son from his first marriage to move in with his mother, and argued for the 10-year mandatory minimum. Prosecutors countered that Winchester's actions that day indicated he planned a murder-suicide that was only averted by Denise's quick thinking, and asked the court for the 45-year maximum. Winchester is now imprisoned in the Wakulla Correctional Institution.http://www.dc.state.fl.us/offendersearch/  Discovery of body  No mention was made of the Williams case at Brian Winchester's sentencing, although State Attorney Jack Campbell told the media that he hoped the case against Winchester would help authorities solve that disappearance. Later it was reported that he had reached an agreement with prosecutors before the sentencing that they would neither seek a life sentence on the kidnapping charge nor introduce certain evidence at the hearing. What that agreement required of Winchester, if anything, beyond his guilty plea has not been disclosed. The next day, at a news conference, Mark Perez, the FDLE's special agent in charge, announced to assembled reporters that Williams's body had been found and it had been determined he was the victim of a homicide. However, they declined to release any details of how he had been killed, who might be a suspect or person of interest, or where the body had been found, saying they were withholding that information since only the perpetrators would be expected to know it. Subsequently, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement revealed they had found Mike Williams's remains at the end of dead-end Gardner Road in northern Leon County, five miles () from where he grew up; they were confirmed as his following a match to his mother's DNA. No other details were provided. After Denise Williams was arrested, the FDLE disclosed that they had received information on where the body was in early October 2017. County public works employees brought in backhoes for what they were told was a training exercise. After five 16-hour days of digging holes in the mud at that corner of the lake, all the while holding back the lake waters by dams and pumps amid the constant presence of eels and water moccasins, the FDLE was ready to hire a private contractor to finish the job. On October 18, the team of search dogs and officers finally found Mike Williams's remains in the piles of dirt stacked on plywood sheets. An FDLE source told the Tallahassee Democrat that 98% of his bones were recovered, all very well preserved, as was some of the clothing he had been wearing, such as winter gloves and booties. Two DNA tests matched the remains to his mother's sample.  Arrest and trial of Denise Williams  On May 8, 2018, Denise Williams was arrested at Florida State as she left work to celebrate her daughter's 19th birthday, minutes after a grand jury had indicted her on charges of first- degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, and accessory after the fact. Prosecutors continued to keep details of the crime to themselves, saying they would share them in court when the time came. They did say that they would seek to have her denied bail. Denise's attorney declined to comment at that time, saying he had not had time to review the case. Denise's estranged husband, Winchester, was serving his sentence at Wakulla Correctional Institution near Tallahassee; his attorney said his client would take the stand at trial if legally compelled to do so. However, the attorney did not think Winchester would be charged in the case as well. Two FDLE officers went to Cheryl Williams's house immediately following the indictment to inform her. She did not speak to the media about how she reacted to the news. The three-page indictment was released two days later. It revealed that prosecutors believed Denise allegedly began conspiring with Winchester in March 2000, nine months before her first husband disappeared. Winchester is alleged to have killed Michael with a gun. The accessory charge suggested that sometime between August 2014 and the day Winchester was sentenced, Denise had allegedly helped Winchester avoid prosecution or arrest for the crime. Ethan Way, Denise's lawyer, said his client was innocent of all the charges. \\"[She] had absolutely nothing to do with Mike Williams's disappearance and had absolutely nothing to do with any of the crimes that Brian Winchester committed.\\" He found it convenient that the indictment came after Winchester had been imprisoned for several months. On Denise's behalf, Way entered a plea of not guilty.  Trial  In late June 2018, Denise Williams was ordered held without bond, with trial date set for September 24. Audio of Brian Winchester's interview with the FDLE was played in court. In it, Brian confessed to pulling the trigger but claims the killing was Denise's idea. Her defense argued that the tape should not have been admitted as evidence since Winchester was not charged with anything despite his admission; the prosecution said it simply asked him to tell the truth about what happened. She went on trial in December. The state's star witness was Brian Winchester, who testified at length about how he and Denise had never really ended their high school relationship, even after they both married others. Kathy Thomas, Winchester's first wife, told the jury that she had suspected the two of having an affair in the late 1990s, when they frequently double-dated with Mike and Denise. Brian said in his confession, a tape of which was played for the jury, that the affair had started in 1997 and just \\"snowballed\\". After discreetly rekindling the relationship, the two began to consider killing Mike so they could marry, as Denise's family frowned on divorce for religious reasons. Denise suggested staging a boating accident on the Gulf of Mexico where they could throw both Mike and Kathy Thomas overboard, but Winchester did not want to kill his children's mother. After rejecting plans for a murder at Mike's office meant to look like a robbery, Winchester hit on the idea of an apparent hunting accident after he saved Mike from quicksand when the two were hunting in Arkansas. On the day Mike disappeared, Winchester said, he had enticed him to Lake Seminole. Out on the water, he had gotten Mike to put the waders on, then pushed him out of the boat, thinking he would be unable to resurface and thus would drown. But instead, he managed to get to a tree stump, so Winchester fired a single shotgun blast to the face. Since Mike's death could no longer be passed off as a boating accident, Winchester buried the body where it was later found, then cleaned out his truck and went to a family Christmas party, where he learned that a search was underway. He and Denise took it slow after Mike's \\"accident\\", both to let the insurance money earn further interest and to allay any suspicion. The kidnapping that had led to his present imprisonment, he explained, was his reaction to fear that Denise would reveal the truth about what had happened to her first husband now that she and Brian were divorcing. Prosecutors also played a taped phone conversation in which Kathy Thomas, who was working with police at the time, had told Denise she knew the truth about the crime. Each time she brought it up, Denise attempted to change the subject, but at one point asked \\"What do you know?\\" Assistant state attorney Jon Fuchs said this evasiveness, as well as Denise's dispassionate response when Winchester told her how he had killed Mike, demonstrated how cold-bloodedly she had planned and executed the crime. Way argued in response that there was no physical evidence linking Denise to the crime and that it had been entirely Winchester's idea; he expressed incredulity that Winchester was not on trial despite having admitted to committing the crime himself. After four days of testimony, the jury took eight hours to convict Denise of all the charges. Way said his client would appeal the conviction. In February 2019, Denise was sentenced to life in prison. She did not speak or offer any argument on her behalf. The only person to address the court besides the lawyers was Cheryl Williams, who said that justice had finally been served, and that Denise had taken not only her son but also her granddaughter from her. Five months later, Mike and Denise's daughter Anslee was awarded all assets of her late father's estate and insurance monies due to Denise, after her mother signed them over to her to avoid prosecution on three counts of insurance fraud. As part of the deal, Anslee may not use any of the money on her mother's legal fees; if she did, she would owe the state a $150,000 penalty. Denise is now imprisoned at the Florida Women's Reception Center. Appeal In January 2020, Denise Williams appealed her conviction and life sentence. Her attorney argued before the Florida First District Court of Appeals that there was no evidence she was involved in the commission of the murder. In the media In the early 2000s, Cheryl Williams had posted flyers, put up signs, and run newspaper ads soliciting information about the case. One of the ads drew the attention of Jennifer Portman, a reporter at the Tallahassee Democrat. In 2006, after the closure of the first FDLE investigation, she wrote a lengthy story about the case. She followed the story through Denise's conviction, making a point of keeping the poster for the case on her cubicle wall. In 2011, the case made it into two other media formats. Carrie Cox, the psychic and profiler who had identified a possible burial site at which no body was found, published Alligator Alibi, a lengthy book with documents from the investigation, Cheryl Williams's notes, and her own commentary. She supported it with an eponymous Facebook page, where she regularly publishes whatever updates she can and news about other, similar cases. Near the end of that year, the Investigation Discovery cable channel series Disappeared devoted an episode to the case. Cheryl Williams promoted it heavily in the days before it aired. Portman, who was interviewed, said she could always tell when it got rerun due to the increase in email she got, many of which asked questions she herself had tried in vain to get authorities to answer. After one such re-airing in 2015, she expressed the hope that \\"one day ... instead of a question, there will be an answer\\". The Crime Junkie podcast featured the case in an episode that was released in early 2019.

History  The Maryborough School of Arts was constructed in 1887‚Äì1888 to the design of Melbourne and Adelaide architect, John Grainger. The substantial two-storeyed rendered brick building replaced the first Maryborough School of Arts which was a small brick building constructed in 1861 soon after the establishment of a local School of Arts committee in 1860. The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established in 1847‚Äì1848 providing transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1850 Surveyor, Hugh Roland Labatt arrived in Maryborough with instructions to \\"examine the River Mary...to suggest ...the best site or sites for the laying out of the town, having regard to the convenience of shipping on one hand and internal communication on the other...also...point out the spots desirable as reserves for public building, church, quay and for places for public recreation.\\" The site recommended by Labatt was not where settlement was established but further east and from the early 1850s this is where the growing town developed. By 1860 the local community had decided upon the erection of a School of Arts, where technical classes could be held for adults and provision made for a public library. Schools of Arts were established all over Queensland in the nineteenth century, with the Brisbane School of Arts being the first in 1849. The institutions were part of a nineteenth-century British movement encouraging widespread popular education, particularly in industrial areas. Mechanics Institutes and later Schools of Arts, co-operative societies, working men's colleges and the university extension movement were all formed to improve the education of working men and instruct them in various trades. This movement broadened to include all types of adult education, both technical and cultural. Applied or useful arts, rather than fine arts, formed the basis of the education provided at the Schools of Arts, as they became the forerunners to the technical education movement and in fact usually provided class rooms for what latter became technical colleges. Four tenders were received by the School of Arts Committee on 10 October 1860 for the erection of a timber building and that of local contractor, W Holland for was accepted. In January of the following year it was reported that the Queensland Government had granted a site to the Committee for the erection of their building, describes as Allotment 4 on Section 85 containing an area of two roods. The Queensland Government generally supported the establishment of Schools of Arts throughout Queensland and often provided some sort of subsidy, in the form of a loan for construction as well as a land grant for their construction. The land granted was in Kent Street where the current School of Arts building stands, opposite the early police and justice reserve. The foundation stone was laid on 5 February 1861 by Gilbert Eliott, the newly elected member for Wide Bay in the Queensland Legislative Assembly. On 17 October 1861 the building was officially opened with the hope that it would \\"be the first of a number of links which would unite all classes for the common good, it was a place where all could meet without distinction.\\" The building constructed was of brick with a steeply pitched gabled roof and ornamental bargeboard, symmetrically arranged with a central entrance and simple flat arched window openings. Although Maryborough was proclaimed a municipality (the Borough of Maryborough) in October 1861 it was not until 1874 that the town acquired a Town Hall which was constructed beside the first School of Arts. In 1884 a Maryborough School of Arts Land Sale Act (1884) was passed to enable the trustees of the School of Arts to sell a portion of their grant to finance the construction of a new School of Arts. As early as 1885 sections of the allotment were sold with the largest section retained as the site of the new School of Arts. Competitive designs were invited from architects for a substantial School of Arts in Maryborough and prize money being offered. Thirty one entries were received and, at a meeting on 10 November 1886, that of John Grainger was awarded the first prize and the contract for the project. The prize winning entry was for a substantial two- storeyed rendered brick building, with a prominent classically inspired facade which was to cost no more than . John Grainger was an architect of Adelaide and Melbourne who had opened an office in Brisbane after his partnership, Grainger and D'Ebro, won a design competition for the Brisbane Public Offices, later known as the Treasury Building. However, their design for the Brisbane building was overlooked in favour of John James Clark's. Grainger returned to Melbourne and his partnership with Charles D'Ebro ended before he entered the competition for the Maryborough School of Arts. After completion of that project he was appointed to the position of Chief Architect of the Western Australian Department of Public Works. The contract for the construction of the School of Arts was let on 1 March 1887 to local contractors, Jacob and John Rooney (J&J; Rooney) and the final construction cost was . The foundation stone for the building was laid on 3 June 1887 in an elaborate ceremony. The building constructed was a substantial tw- storeyed rendered brick structure with a classically inspired facade reflecting the cultural and educational aspirations of the institution. Many public buildings constructed since the Renaissance employed elements of classical architecture to imbue the structure with a sense of tradition and authority. The principal facade of the Maryborough School of Arts employs classical proportion and symmetry as well as detailing like the round arched windows of the first floor, oculi openings above the ground floor windows, entablature surmounted by central triangular pediment flanked by acroteria, as well as a system of projecting pilasters and rustication encouraging a three dimensional quality. In a lengthy report on Maryborough in 1895, the Sydney Mail, described the School of Arts as the \\"lion of the town\\" to which \\"every visitor is duty bound to go over...and admire...with fervour.\\" The building was opened in a discreet ceremony on 21 May 1888 and a short report in the Maryborough Chronicle, described the building and services offered in the improved structure. The library, with over 5,000 volumes, was housed on the ground floor as well as two large class rooms separated by cedar folding doors. On the first floor was a reading room with a groined ceiling and, adjacent to this, a smoking room. Later in 1888 the School of Arts Committee received a grant of from local benefactor, Janet Melville for the establishment of a museum in the new building. Glass cabinets were fixed in the foyer and reading room and an extensive collection was amassed including timber and mineral samples, works of art and examples of taxidermy. After a grant of was received from the Queensland Government for the establishment of technical classes in art and science in 1890, the Maryborough School of Arts commenced teaching classes. The popularity and success of these technical classes, which would in time lead to the establishment of the Maryborough Technical College, meant that a timber class room extension was added to the rear of the building in 1895. J & J Rooney's tender of was accepted on 11 January and the extension was completed in June 1895. In April 1896 a verandah and ground floor loggia was added to the eastern side of the School of Arts to the design of local contractor Charles Crystall from partnership, Crystall and Armstrong. The tender of another local contractor, Henry Neale, for was accepted for the construction of the verandah and loggia and the cast iron balustrading was sourced from the local Albion Foundry. The spaces thus formed were provided as a shady retreat in the \\"trying summer months\\". A verandah was also erected on the rear of the timber classroom extension in 1900, although this section was again extended in 1903‚Äì1904 with the erection of another lecture hall. A Recreation Club was established in one of the rear timber buildings and this was furnished with billiard tables and assumed the role of the smoking room on the first floor of the main building which was converted into a reference library. The next major alteration occurred in 1907 when Bundaberg architect, Frederic Herbert Faircloth was commissioned to design a gallery in the library of the School of Arts. Faircloth had previously designed a similar gallery for the School of Arts in Bundaberg. Tenders were called on 21 August 1907 and the lowest tender from T. McLeod of was accepted. The final cost of the gallery was and the timber structure provided a balustraded internal balcony on three sides of the library and was accessed by a narrow timber stair from the ground floor. This addition allowed the book shelving to be extended to the ceiling. The Maryborough Technical College, although still housed in the School of Arts, became a separately managed association with its own committee in 1910. When the Maryborough City Hall was erected opposite the School of Arts, the former town hall site was purchased for the erection of technical college buildings. By 1936 the Technical College had expanded and was removed from the School of Arts to the newly established Maryborough State High School, at the former Grammar School grounds. Maryborough School of Arts, 1930 From the 1920s government subsidies to the School of Arts were reduced, in favour of the technical colleges and this further reduced their role in the community. Renovation projects were undertaken at the School of Arts from the 1910s and the building became used as offices for various local community bodies, including the Country Women's Association and the Grammarians Recreation Club. During the World War II the School of Arts was resumed by the Government for use by the Australian Comforts Fund when extra bathroom facilities were added. A servicemen's club for members of the RAAF stationed in Maryborough was established in the building. Although the library continued operating on the ground floor, the first floor of the School of Arts was maintained as tenancies for various bodies after the World War II. In 1949 the Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) and the Engineering Section of the Post Master General's Department (PMG) moved into the first floor. Plans for offices and a broadcasting studio for the ABC were prepared by Brisbane architects, Hennessy & Hennessy, and the local ABC radio was established in the building. At this time the eastern verandah was enclosed to house offices of the PMG's Department. In 1943 the Libraries Act was passed which sought to make better provision for the establishment and management of public libraries. The Act empowered local authorities to establish libraries, and also to assume management of the libraries currently operated by Schools of Arts. However, it was not until 1972 that the Maryborough City Council and the School of Arts Committee drew up an agreement which meant resulted in the Council accepting trusteeship of the School of Arts land and buildings, and for the council to be responsible for any financial deficiencies of the Committee. The School of Arts Committee agreed to operate the library until a Municipal Library was established. The Maryborough Public Library was opened in May 1977 and this meant the closure of the library at the School of Arts. Following this the Maryborough Wide Bay and Burnett Historical Society remained in the building as tenants and were given a forty-year lease.  Description  The Maryborough School of Arts is a substantial two storeyed masonry building, prominently located on Kent Street adjacent to the new City Council Chambers and opposite the 1906 Town Hall. The site contains the building constructed to the line of the footpath with a two storeyed timber framed verandah to the south east covering a driveway to an open space at the rear. The School of Arts is a smooth rendered brick building with a hipped roof. The principal, south western facade of the School of Arts, which addresses Kent Street, is symmetrically arranged and employs classical proportion and detailing. The facade is divided into five bays divided by rusticated pilasters at the ground floor level and by single and double engaged columns with Corinthian capitals on the first floor. The central bay features a recessed arched entrance porch to which access is provided via two concrete steps from ground level. The keystone of the moulding surrounding the archway has a plaster moulded bust of Minerva, goddess of the city and protector of civilised life. From behind her head foliage, of two different types, emerges. Flanking the entrance, in the recesses formed by the rusticated pilasters, are two square arched openings surmounted by oculi with decorative mouldings joining the two windows. At first floor level are five, equally sized, round arched openings, in the recesses of the attached columns, with sills resting on blank balustraded panels. Mouldings surround the arched heads of these windows, and moulded swags are found on recessed panels above the windows. The engaged columns support an entablature which acts as a parapet, with a central projecting panel featuring the words, \\"SCHOOL OF ARTS\\". Above the signage panel is a triangular pediment supported on a rectangular panel divided by squat engaged columns aligned with those on the levels below. The north western facade of the building is attached to the adjacent City Council Chambers and a recent thoroughfare on the first floor of the School of Arts provides access to its neighbouring building. The south eastern elevation of the School of Arts is concealed by a double storeyed verandah covering a driveway on that side of the building. The verandah is supported, at ground level on a series of cast iron columns on masonry plinths, and has a deep scalloped timber frieze below first floor level. The first floor of the verandah structure is infilled with fibrous cement sheeting and glazing. The face of this side of the building continues the openings found on the principal facade for two bays. The rear of the School of Arts is unrendered brickwork, of two types of brick reflecting the growth of the building. There are only four small square openings at first floor level on this elevation. Internally the building is arranged around a large central hall, accessed from the principal entrance off Kent Street. Rooms are found off either side of the hall on the ground floor and the hall is terminated in the eastern corner of the building with the stair hall. The entrance is through an elaborate double timber door opening from the recessed porch. The doors are half glazed and panelled, surmounted by a triangular pedimented entablature and all surrounded by clear glazed sidelights and semicircular fanlight. Generally the interior has timber boarded floors, plastered walls and timber boarded ceilings. On the first floor level of the building the ceilings are of timber boards which rake downwards to meet original walls. The dog legged timber stair is cantilevered above the midway landing and has turned timber balusters and substantial turned and carved timber newels. Providing natural lighting to the stairwell is a large round arched opening on the south eastern wall of the building. On the ground level of the School of Arts, through a door on the north west side of the central hall is the early library of the building, now used by a local historical society. This large room, extending almost the full length of the building, has a timber gallery, which seems to be suspended with iron rods from roof beams, to which access is provided via a steep and narrow stair. The gallery is lined with a simple cast iron balustrade, comprising decorative iron newels joined by an iron rail, and a base skirting board of timber with trefoiled cutouts. The library is filled with early books and bookshelves, early museum display cabinets and other early items of importance to the understanding of the history of the building. Elsewhere on the ground and upper floor are smaller rooms with extant timber joinery and other fittings.  Heritage listing  School of Arts was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Maryborough School of Arts building demonstrates the development of adult education in Queensland from the nineteenth-century movement concerned with providing popular education by local communities to twentieth century-state education programmes. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is characteristic of a large regional School of Arts, constructed in a classical style, and housing a reading room, library and class rooms. Though a standard feature of most Queensland towns of the nineteenth century, Schools of Art have been replaced by other education facilities and municipal libraries, and therefore a once prominent and integral feature of the town fabric, the civic role of the Maryborough School of Arts has been altered dramatically. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building is an important element of the Kent Street streetscape, with a prominent, well composed facade. The building features fine joinery, well crafted plasterwork and well proportioned internal spaces. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building, a public facility for over one hundred years and the forerunner to the current municipal library and technical college, has special importance to the local community. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building, a public facility for over one hundred years and the forerunner to the current municipal library and technical college, has special importance to the local community.

The fossil specimen, holotype ERNO 8553, was found in the northeastern Mexican state of Sonora, in the Cabullona Group, in a bed of the Packard Shale which may date from the late Campanian, 72 million years ago. It consists of a partial skeleton without skull. This includes the first phalanx of the first finger of the left hand, the first and second phalanx of the third right finger, the lower ends of the second, third and fourth metatarsals, the first and second phalanx of the second toe, the second and third phalanges of the third toe, the first, third and fourth phalanx of the fourth toe, the first and second phalanx of the left second toe, and a claw of the left foot. These fossil elements, none of which are complete, were found disarticulated in an area of fifty centimeters square.  Description  Tototlmimus is a medium-sized ornithomimid. The descriptors could identify five distinguishing characteristics. The lower ends of the second and fourth metatarsals do not diverge but are appressed to the lower side surfaces of the third metatarsal. This contact is made possible because the inside of the third metatarsal fits perfectly with the sides of the second and fourth metatarsals. The third metatarsal has an only weakly developed ginglymoid inferior articular surface. The unguals, the bones of the foot claws, are narrow and asymmetric with shallow grooves on both sides. The foot claws have only a shallow a longitudinal groove for the flexor tendon, but a deep groove in the lower inner side near the surface of the articulation. Tototlmimus shows a foot with a typical build for ornithomimosaurs. The midfoot is an arctometatarsus, with a third metatarsal that becomes narrower at the top. The foot claws have an triangular joint surface with a relatively straight bottom edge. The rear edge forms a \\"heel\\" with in front of it a transverse groove.  Phylogeny  Tototlmimus was placed in the Ornithomimidae, in a derived position. It is the first ornithomimid named from Mexico and one of the southernmost known in North America. According to a cladistic analysis in the scientific description, it was the sister genus of Ornithomimus.

SADs can be seen at center frame‚Äìnote the dark \\"tadpoles\\" descending toward the bright coronal loop arcade. Supra-arcade downflows (SADs) are sunward-traveling plasma voids that are sometimes observed in the Sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, during solar flares. In solar physics, an ‚Äúarcade‚Äù refers to a bundle of coronal loops, and the prefix ‚Äúsupra‚Äù indicates that the downflows appear above flare arcades. They were first described in 1999 using the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) on board the Yohkoh satellite. SADs are byproducts of the magnetic reconnection process that drives solar flares, but their precise cause remains unknown.  Observations = Description  SADs are dark, finger-like plasma voids that are sometimes observed descending through the hot, dense plasma above bright coronal loop arcades during solar flares. They were first reported for a flare and associated coronal mass ejection that occurred on January 20, 1999 and was observed by the SXT onboard Yohkoh. SADs are sometimes referred to as ‚Äútadpoles‚Äù for their shape and have since been identified in many other events (e.g.). They tend to be most easily observed in the decay phases of long-duration flares, when sufficient plasma has accumulated above the flare arcade to make SADs visible, but they do begin earlier during the rise phase. In addition to the SAD voids, there are related structures known as supra-arcade downflowing loops (SADLs). SADLs are retracting (shrinking) coronal loops that form as the overlying magnetic field is reconfigured during the flare. SADs and SADLs are thought to be manifestations of the same process viewed from different angles, such that SADLs are observed if the viewer's perspective is along the axis of the arcade (i.e. through the arch), while SADs are observed if the perspective is perpendicular to the arcade axis. SDO AIA 131 √Ö on 2011 Oct 2.  Basic properties  SADs typically begin 100‚Äì200 Mm above the photosphere and descend 20‚Äì50 Mm before dissipating near the top of the flare arcade after a few minutes. Sunward speeds generally fall between 50 and 500 km s‚àí1 but may occasionally approach 1000 km s‚àí1. As they fall, the downflows decelerate at rates of 0.1 to 2 km s‚àí2. SADs appear dark because they are considerably less dense than the surrounding plasma, while their temperatures (100,000 to 10,000,000 K) do not differ significantly from their surroundings. Their cross-sectional areas range from a few million to 70 million km2 (for comparison, the cross-sectional area of the Moon is 9.5 million km2).  Instrumentation  SADs are typically observed using soft X-ray and Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) telescopes that cover a wavelength range of roughly 10 to 1500 Angstroms (√Ö) and are sensitive to the high-temperature (100,000 to 10,000,000 K) coronal plasma through which the downflows move. These emissions are blocked by Earth's atmosphere, so observations are made using space observatories. The first detection was made by the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) onboard Yohkoh (1991‚Äì2001). Observations soon followed from the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE, 1998‚Äì2010), an EUV imaging satellite, and the spectroscopic SUMER instrument on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO, 1995‚Äì2016). More recently, studies on SADs have used data from the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) onboard Hinode (2006‚Äîpresent) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO, 2010‚Äîpresent). In addition to EUV and X-ray instruments, SADs may also be seen by white light coronagraphs such as the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard SOHO, though these observations are less common.  Causes  SADs are widely accepted to be byproducts of magnetic reconnection, the physical process that drives solar flares by releasing energy stored in the Sun's magnetic field. Reconnection reconfigures the local magnetic field surrounding the flare site from a higher-energy (non-potential, stressed) state to a lower-energy (potential) state. This process is facilitated by the development of a current sheet, often preceded by or in tandem with a coronal mass ejection. As the field is being reconfigured, newly formed magnetic field lines are swept away from the reconnection site, producing outflows both toward and away from the solar surface, respectively referred to as downflows and upflows. SADs are believed to be related to reconnection downflows that perturb the hot, dense plasma that collects above flare arcades, but precisely how SADs form is uncertain and is an area of active research. SADs were first interpreted as cross sections of magnetic flux tubes, which comprise coronal loops, that retract down due to magnetic tension after being formed at the reconnection site. This interpretation was later revised to suggest that SADs are instead wakes behind much smaller retracting loops (SADLs), rather than cross sections of the flux tubes themselves. Another possibility, also related to reconnection outflows, is that SADs arise from an instability, such as the Rayleigh-Taylor instability or a combination of the tearing mode and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.

He is also the original creator of the globally-formation (relay-stadial) concept of world history and is a Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Historical Sciences, and Professor. He graduated from the history department of the Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical Institute. For a while he taught history in the provincial universities. After his work in the field of antroposotsiogeneza attracted the attention of prominent scientists of Moscow, he defended his doctoral thesis at the Institute of Ethnography (1963). In 1967, Semenov became a professor of the Department of Philosophy of the Moscow Physical-Technical Institute (Dolgoprudny), where he has worked for half a century and continued to the present (fall 2015). Semenov has also worked at the Institute of World History, USSR Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology. Having began a scientific career by studying the primitive society, Semenov simultaneously developed the problem of politar society - first class societies that preceded feudalism. Research in this area led him to create the original globally stadial concept of world history. Throughout his academic career sharing the basic principles of Marxism, Semenov developed these ideas according to the new factual material, thus becoming one of the prominent members of the Soviet (and later - Russian) \\"creative Marxism\\".

It was built in 1918. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 July 1993.  History  The Waterside Workers' Hall Maryborough is a single storeyed timber building erected for the Maryborough branch of the Waterside Workers Federation. The Port of Maryborough was regularly visited by a number of ships, most of which were associated with the carrying of timber. In 1850 the town of Maryborough was moved to its present site as that part of the Mary River was considered preferable for shipping. Gazetted a port in 1859, Maryborough continued to develop as the major port and centre servicing the Wide Bay region. The Hall was used as a meeting place and pickup centre for the workers. It was funded by a levy of struck on all members and was erected in Wharf Street, in proximity to the wharves and also to other buildings including the Bond Store, Customs House, and several hotels, also associated with the workings of the port. Prior to 1943, workers were selected according to the Bull System, that is workers for each shift were chosen by the shipping bosses. After that time, they were selected by the Union on a rotational basis. Both systems required the men to present themselves for work on notice of the arrival of a ship. In Maryborough some companies required the wharfies to meet at the wharves. Others, such as local firms Hyne and Son and Wilson Hart are recorded as using the Hall as a pickup centre, which, as a sheltered building with seating was preferred by the wharfies to the open sheds on the wharves. With changes in communication and transportation and the development and increasing importance of Urangan as a deep water sugar port, the Port of Maryborough began to decline. By the 1950s Maryborough wharfies were increasingly employed at Urangan, but with Maryborough remaining the pickup place for local workers. On 18 March 1963 the last work was performed by waterside workers at Maryborough. The Maryborough Branch and the Hall were, however, maintained, although all work performed by Maryborough workers was done at Urangan, Bundaberg, and Gladstone. In 1972, the register of waterside workers which was still maintained at Maryborough was closed and a register opened at Urangan. The Urangan Branch assumed control of the assets of the Maryborough Branch. In the 1960s the back half of the hall was rented to the present owner for storage. The front section was also rented to both bands for rehearsal and to weightlifters as a training centre. In 1980, the building was purchased by the present owner, who operates a marine engineering business from an adjoining building. The hall is currently used for storage.  Description  The Waterside Workers' Hall is a single-storeyed timber and iron building facing Wharf Street to the north, with a view of the Mary River to the northeast. This long rectangular building has a corrugated iron gable roof, timber stumps and a single skin chamferboard street facade with recessed central entry and a sash window to either side. These windows have sheet metal hoods and the gable has a mounted flagpole. The single skin weatherboard east elevation has sash windows and borders a service lane. Other elevations are of corrugated iron with a lean-to structure at the rear containing a gantry for unloading equipment. Internally, the central entry leading into the hall, has a room to either side with single skin tongue-and-groove partition walls, most of which is missing from the northwest room. The roof is unlined and the rear lean-to, which has a raised timber floor, was accessed via an opening which resembles a proscenium arch. The Criterion Hotel borders the west boundary and a diesel workshop and a large boarding house is located to the east. The rear of the property is grassed.

Established in 1414, it is the oldest mosque in the Moluccas and possibly the oldest mosque in Indonesia which has been maintained in its original state. Description Wapauwe Mosque is located in the historic village of Kaitetu where remnants of Portuguese buildings lie such as a Portuguese church and a Portuguese trading post which later reestablished by the Dutch as a fort. The humble-sized wooden mosque is maintained by both the Christian and Muslim community of the village. The 15th century mosque has been maintained by keeping its original wooden form, using no nails but tied with ijuk fiber ropes. History The first Wapauwe Mosque was established in Kampung Wawane, about 6 kilometers from its present place, in 1414. Its founder, Maulana Kiai Pati, was an Islamic proponent from the coast of Nukuhaly, Seram Island. This original mosque is constructed of sago frond walls and palm leaf roof. Kiai Pati converted five villages in the Wawane Mountains, namely the villages of Essen, Wawane, Atetu, Nukuhaly and Tehala. In 1464, another group of Muslims led by Kyai Jamilu from the Sultanate of Jailolo, on the island of Halmahera in North Maluku. Jamilu continued the maintenance of the Wawane Mosque during his time in the village, as well as redeveloping the building into a larger mosque. The Dutch arrived in early 17th-century and controlled Wawane. To avoid tension with the Dutch, in 1614 Imam Rijali, a descendant of Jamilu, led the exodus of the villagers to the village of Tehala, about 6 km east of Wawane. During the exodus, the Wawane Mosque was dismantled and transported to the new place. The mosque was reconstructed on a plain where many wild mango trees grow. The mosque then received its present name Wapauwe Mosque, after the mango (wapa means \\"wild mango\\", and uwe means \\"tree\\" in local Kaitetu language). Nowadays, some locals believe that the mosque moved magically by itself to Wapauwe. The first major renovation of the mosque was in 1664 when it was twice transported and rebuilt without any changes to its original appearance. In the beginning of the 18th century, a spire on top of the mosque was installed. The spire represents the Arabic letter alif, a letter that symbolizes Allah. The second major renovation was in 1895 when a porch was added to the front and to the east of the original mosque. The renovation in 1895 also installed lime concrete reinforcement on the lower side of the wooden wall, and replaced the original coral gravel-layered floor with cement. The 1895 restoration was initiated by a local figure Hamid Iha. Several minor renovations was undertaken during the post-colonial period without changing its appearance. In 1977, the Armed Forces' Military Districts of the area, the Komando Daerah Militer XVI/Pattimura, installed fences along the periphery. In 1982, the mosque was designated as a Cultural Property. An official plaque was installed and inaugurated by the Head of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, Bachtiar Rifai. In the 1990s, the roof thatch was replaced with similar material. This restoration involved two dusun (\\"township\\") of Kaitetu village, Dusun Hila Kristen (a Christian majority) and Dusun Kalauli. The restoration was led by Head of the Adat Ir. H. Abdullah Lumaela. In 1993, the charity work of the 733rd Airborne Battalion undertook the construction of additional facilities, such as porches, pump wells, and garden ponds. Since 1995, the mosque is equipped with a loudspeaker from a government bank. Last restoration of the mosque was in March 2008 when the roof thatch was replaced again. Treasury The mosque kept one of the oldest Qur'anic mus'hafs in Indonesia; the oldest of these is a mus'haf written by Imam Muhammad Arikulapessy - the mosque's first imam - which was completed in 1550 with no miniature decoration. The other is a mus'haf written by Nur Cahya, completed in 1590. Nur Cahya is the granddaughter of Arikulapessy and a student of the mosque's founder Kiai Pati. There were also other historic manuscripts kept inside the mosque such as a Muslim calendar from Gregorian year 1407 and a manuscript for a Friday Prayer in year 1661. All these treasuries are now kept in the heritage house of Abdurrachim Hatauwe, the twelfth descendant of Arikulapessy. The mosque also stored a poetry book about Muhammad's life. The poem is sung regularly by the villagers, especially during the annual Mawlid. Other objects stored in the mosque were two oil lamps made of wood and brass, wooden scales, a beduk carved of linggua wood. Architecture The original wooden construction of the mosque is retained, using no nails or pegs. The main mosque is about 10 x 10 meters wide with an additional porch of roughly 40 square meters. The architectural style follows the typical traditional mosque architecture in Indonesia with multi-tiered roofs, supported with the saka guru pillars, and no minaret. The multi-tiered roof is supported with four main columns known as the saka guru. The roof is topped with a wooden tip mounted perpendicular to the top. These main pillars were made of kanjoli or bintanggur wood (Calophyllum soulattri) which grows in abundance in the coastal area of Tanah Hitu. The walls are covered in gaba-gaba (dried sago fronds) as well as the thatched roof. The wooden main door is decorated with spearhead-shaped wooden ornaments inscribed with calligraphic writings of Allah and Muhammad on its four corners, and a turtle-shaped brass plate etched with a Salawat invocation.

The quote originates from a fictional satire piece, \\"Four-Year Curriculum of University\\", written by famous columnist Chip Tsao and published in the newspaper Apple Daily in 2004. The meme has since been adapted into a number of derivative creations, including a viral video and a musical parody on YouTube. It has also become an internet slang phrase widely used by Hong Kong netizens. \\"Come On, James\\" refers to both Tsao's satirical column and the quote itself.  Background  The phrase \\"Come On, James\\" originates from the satirical piece, \\"Four-Year Curriculum of University\\", by famous columnist Chip Tsao, published in the newspaper Apple Daily on 25 October 2004. In the article, Tsao mocked the reformed tertiary-education-system ‚Äì the 334 Scheme ‚Äì and questioned the credibility of Associate degree courses and community colleges in Hong Kong. The piece became popular after it was shared on the Hong Kong Golden Forum, one of the most frequently read social platforms in the city. The sarcastic phrase \\"Come On, James\\" caught the most attention of readers and soon became a viral internet meme.  Synopsis  Tsao aimed to illustrate the problems that the 334 Scheme brought to the education system in Hong Kong. He wrote the article as a short story about a couple breaking up because they went to differently-ranked colleges. In the story, the female character, who was studying in the University of Hong Kong, one of the top universities worldwide euphemistically told her boyfriend, James, that they were drifting away from each other. She blamed James, who went to community college. During the conversation, James' girlfriend quipped, \\"Come on, James. Can you be more mature?\\", after James became irritated by her attitude. At the end the story, it was explained that the female character had already gotten a new boyfriend also studying at the University of Hong Kong, with brighter career prospects.  Analysis  Commentators have linked the success of Come On, James to a number of social phenomena in Hong Kong at the time of its publication.  Criticism on Education Reform  \\"Come on, James.\\" reflects that the overwhelming number of Associate Degree courses leads to the mere recognition of associate degree in Hong Kong.Call for additional university places South China Morning Post.

By code-switching in Cantonese and English, \\"Kong Girl\\" always tries to show off their English proficiency. Being self-centered is one of the characteristics of \\"Kong Girl\\".

It sparked a controversy between the two camps since the new four-year curriculum was the same as the system of mainland China's.  Derivative Works = Sequels by Chip Tsao  Two sequels were published by Chip Tsao in Apple Daily five years later in July 2009, and another six years later in July 2015.  Adaptations  There are several adaptations of \\"Come On, James\\" regarding different subjects including the iPhone 3GS, Bawang Chinese herbal medicine shampoo and Indonesian instant noodles brand Indomie.  Video  On 18 September 2013, a video based on the storyline of \\"Four-Year Curriculum of University\\" was published on the YouTube channel \\"Open Video\\". It has received almost 400,000 views by the end of October 2015. The video conveys the main message of the original story, which criticises the drawbacks of four-year tertiary education. The video further depicts the contrasting emotion of two characters. The acting of the male character emphasises that James is disappointed in his girlfriend who breaks their love promise due to the difference of qualifications. The female actress acts out the character's scornful attitude to James. The original article ends with James being dumped by his girlfriend but the video has a different ending. After several years, the girl is cheated on and broke up with his lawyer boyfriend. She is to order a cake in a caf√© to feel better. She was then dumbfounded that James is the owner of the place and regretted dumping James in the past. A new message is sent that people often superficially mistaken success as money and fame.  Musical Parody  On 1 August 2015, a musical parody of \\"Four-Year Curriculum of University\\", named \\"COME ON JAMES\\", was published on the parodic YouTube channel \\"Sing To Say\\" and was posted on Hong Kong Golden Forum. It became the top trending music video of Hong Kong in the same month on YouTube. The video of the musical parody had received over 40,000 views as of November 2015. Re-using the melody of \\"Rash≈çmon\\", the Cantonese number-one hit of Hong Kong pop-singer Juno Mak, the parodist reworked the lyrics along the storyline of \\"Four-Year Curriculum of University\\". Compared to the oblique conversations between the two characters in the article, the lyrics of the parody come way more straightforward indicating the accusation and ridicule from the girl towards James. Yet, the parody contains more portrayal of the male character, James, lingering in, the relationship with the girl, which is fading away.  Internet Slang  The idea of \\"Come on, James\\" was later transformed into a slang widely used by the young generation in Hong Kong, commonly seen on social platforms which underscores one's self-regarded superiority over the others. In the passage written by Chip Tsao, \\"Come on, James\\" is spoken bitterly, sarcastically and disdainfully by a girl who successfully gets into a leading university in Hong Kong yet has got a so-called \\"unmatched\\" boyfriend studying in an associate degree program. As the slang carries an ironic tone, it is widely employed by teenagers nowadays when they feel more superior in terms of economic status, academic achievements or appearances etc. than the others.

She is known for her battle against the brig HMS Swallow, one of the early deeds of then-Lieutenant Charles Baudin. Career=August 1810: battle with HMS Seahorse In August 1809, Charles Baudin, recently promoted to Lieutenant, was appointed to command Renard.Jurien de La Gravi√®re, p.61 (601 on file) On 22 August 1810, while cruising off Tuscany with the brig Ligurie, under Lieutenant Serra, Renard encountered the frigate HMS Seahorse. Renard, the better sailor of the two, allowed Seahorse to chase her while Ligurie sought her escape by sailing close to shore. After a while, Renard and Seahorse found themselves becalmed; when the wind returned, it was to favour Seahorse, and Renard narrowly avoided capture by catching a breeze and running into the Gulf of La Spezia, eventually beaching herself while a storm broke out. As good weather returned, so did Seahorse, and Renard had to endure her bombardment until the evening, although she did not sustain serious damage.Jurien de La Gravi√®re, p.62 (602 on file) Seahorse departed in the evening and Renard, refloated, limped back to Genoa.Jurien de La Gravi√®re, p.63 (603 on file) En route, Renard again met Seahorse, but sought refuge under the shore batteries of Levanto which, although in bad shape, proved sufficient to deter the frigate.Jurien de La Gravi√®re, p.64 (604 on file) Operations in 1810‚Äì11 During 1810 and 1811, Renard escorted convoys off Tuscany and Liguria, reaching as far as Corsica and Elbe. In July 1811, Renard sortied to intercept a British privateer. Renard used a false British flag to reduce the distance of her opponent, before the privateer realised the ruse and attempted to flee. Renard gave chase and, after a solid day of pursuit, overhauled her opponent which struck at her warning shot. She proved to be the 10-gun privateer Three Brothers, of Malta, with a crew of 100 men.Jurien de La Gravi√®re, p.65 (605 on file) to 67 Operations in 1812 In June 1812, Renard was part of the escort of a 33-ship convoy bound for Marseille. Soon after exiting Genoa, the convoy encountered a British squadron comprising the relatively new 74-gun HMS America, the 44-gun frigate Curacoa, and the 20-gun brig-sloop Swallow. The French forces amounted to Renard and the 6-gun schooner Go√©land, under Lieutenant Saint-Belin.Jurien de La Gravi√®re, p.71 (611 on file) Recognising that Swallow, in the van of the British squadron, tended to sail at some distance from the America and Curacoa, Baudin sought an opportunity to isolate and capture her. He instructed Go√©land to sail the convoy into the safety of Saint-Tropez. Then on 17 June, around noon, seizing a moment of favourable wind when Swallow was far in front of the main British forces, engaged her at close range.Jurien de La Gravi√®re, p.72 (612 on file) The brigs traded fire, with shots from Swallow quickly killing Ensign Charton and severely wounding Baudin, who nevertheless continued to direct the action. Meanwhile, Go√©land attempted to assist Renard, but a cannonball took away her rudder and left her momentarily disabled. Soon afterwards, Swallow manoeuvered to rejoin her division, leaving the badly battered Renard, with 42 men casualties, to reach Saint-Tropez.Jurien de La Gravi√®re, p.73 (613 on file) Fate The British were eventually able to seize Renard at the capitulation of Genoa, on 19 April 1814.

Guernsey and Alderney with Island of Sark 1748 Guernsey 1757 Origins The original reason for the separation of the north of the Island of Guernsey may relate to seismic disturbances or changes in the sea level. The rise and fall of the tide in Guernsey is over which creates energy to move loose materials. The Braye was open to the sea and the shoreline moves with the waves and the tides. Gravel and sand are deposited onshore, only to be swept back offshore. Storms batter the coast, and tides flood areas on a daily basis. The premiere forces that shapes the coastal landscape, however, are waves. Beaches are not fixed features, they are dynamic environments. At the eastern end an iron age fort, later to become the castle of Saint Michael where in 1117 there was a large ceremony to celebrate the finalisation of major works. Granite walls and gate were added in the 15th century, barracks in the 18th century, and the name \\"Vale Castle\\" is now the common name. It is likely that at one time a land bridge connected the two sections next to the Vale church, before the sea broke through. In 1204 it is reported that the Royal Court of Guernsey visited the Braye du Valle to replace boundary markers that had been washed away. The Braye covered around 350 acres of sand, gravel, clay and bog. Water channels one or two feet deep ran its entire length. Salterns and marshy meadows that flooded at high tide formed the sides. Saltpans operated on the southern side. long, up to wide and to deep at high water. A leper hospice founded to care for returning crusaders in the 12th century, who had contracted the disease was located at Maladerie Road in St Sampsons, with the cemetery on the edge of Braye du Valle, now covered by L'Islet road. It closed when the disease faded away in the 16th century. Crossings Vale Church from Braye du Valle, at low water * The Great bridge also known as the Pont du Valle 1204 is the date mentioned for a bridge, it required to be maintained in good condition, the bridge was requested in a petition by parish residents dated 4 October 1204 following the loss of a causeway to sea damage. There is mention of the bridge being destroyed in 1299, with the perpetrators being charged and fined. The ‚Äúgreat bridge‚Äù is mentioned in a response from Charles II in 1666. The bridge has, for as long as records exist, been wide enough for pedestrians and wagons, constructed of stone with a nearby sluice or ‚Äúnocq‚Äù. F.C. Lucas, mentions a stone bridge called the ‚ÄúLe Pont du Valle‚Äù built of heavy rock with an open bridge to allow the water to pass underneath, at the ‚ÄúBouche du Valle‚Äù near the Vale church. * Low water bridges There were two small connected bridges at the Vale Church, the Pont St Michel and the Pont Allaire crossing two streams. These bridges were made of large stones with stone slabs resting on top. Covered by the sea at high tide and the stones would have been covered with seaweed. They are reputed to have been built by monks from Mont Saint- Michel who had settled in Guernsey around 968 A.D. The bridges still existed in 1715. * Ferry A ferry existed near the Vale Church, which must have assisted worshippers attending the Vale Church. * Fords Three causeways were identified, one being destroyed in 1708. The 1787 map records a low water crossing point west of the great bridge. Ownership Originally owned by the Crown, on 27 July 1640 the Braye du Valle was gifted, together with other flooded lands, to Sir Henry de Vic by Charles I in consideration of long service to the Crown. The registration of the title was delayed 25 years because of the English Civil War. This also resulted in the boundaries being formally defined and recorded. By 1708 the Braye was owned by Henry de Sausmarez who reclaimed some of the land to construct the salt-pans, the export of salt from Guernsey to England being duty free. In 1730 the Braye was sold to a syndicate of five men for ¬£125. And it was this syndicate that sold the Braye to the British Government in 1805 to enable it to be reclaimed. 17th and 18th centuries Sir Henry de Vic considered reclaiming the Braye and petitioned Charles II for leave to do so. The King gave ‚Äúall those our lands overflowed by sea in our Island of Guernsey situated and lying from the church of the Valle there as far as the great bridge along that side which is the north east side: from the said bridge all along Saint Sampson, which is the south west side, as far as that part which is right against the said church of the Valle‚Ä¶‚Äù to Sir Vic. The area was surveyed, but no work was undertaken. In 1758 a law was passed fining militia soldiers 14 sols tournois if they refused to stand guard north of the Braye du Valle, some soldiers complaining that they were afraid of drowning when crossing the Braye. The Duke of Richmond as Master-General of the Ordnance, commissioned a military survey map of Guernsey, the Braye is well marked as a channel. It was undertaken by William Gardner before 1787. Reclamation In 1803 the newly appointed Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey, Major-General John Doyle was tasked with improving the Island defences. He became concerned with the possibility of French troops landing in the north of the Island and British troops, the militia and artillery being unable to cross the Braye to contest the landing. Not knowing whether he would fight the French as an Admiral or General, as it would depend on the state of the tide. The concern about an invasion was because of the successful Privateer business undertaken by Guernsey. During the eight years of the American Revolutionary War Guernsey ships carrying letter of marque had captured French and American vessels to the value of ¬£900,000 and continued to operate during the Napoleonic Wars The proposal was opposed by the States of Guernsey who would have preferred the Braye to be dredged and straightened to enable larger ships to sail along the channel with quarried stone. This opposition was defeated by the eloquence of Doyle. Sir John Doyle‚Äôs proposal was to dam the extremities of the Braye at the bridge and near the Vale Church, so enclosing around 300 acres. Approval was granted and work began in 1806, being paid for by the British Government. The Government having to pay people with rights to the foreshore and business that would be damaged for loss of earnings. Along the southern shores of the Braye du Valle had been salt pans, their owners receiving compensation for their loss. The saltpan businesses receiving ¬£1,750, with the other owners being paid ¬£1,500. In total ¬£3,250 was paid out. An advert appeared in the Gazette de Guernsey on 1 March 1806 inviting tenders for the construction of two dams,. The work should be done in a solid and permanent manner with the contractor responsible for repairs for the first seven years following completion. The contract would be paid in installments and in the event of failure to meet the terms of the contract, the builder would forfeit the amount paid. The contract was awarded to Thomas Henry, from Les Mielles in Clos du Valle and work began on 12 July 1806. Soldiers were provided to assist with the labour at a cost of 10d a day for a private and a shilling for a sergeant. The embankments being sufficient by late 1806 to stop the tides entering the Braye. Construction method An embankment or dyke was built at Grande Havre, to the west of the Vale Church out of large stones with a brick wall to retain the sand and gravel that was piled up on the landward side. At the St Sampson‚Äôs end a different approach was undertaken. A stone wall was built parallel to the bridge, it was reinforced with clay to provide waterproofing. This created a wide roadway connecting the two Islands above high water level. Sluices were created at both ends to allow surface water to drain at low tide. The whole of the work being undertaken using men, with horse and carts to transport the materials. The work was completed in 1808 and on completion, Mr Henry was presented with a sword by Lieutenant-General Sir John Doyle. In 1812 damage was found to have been caused to the Vale church embankment from storms. Quarries in the area were given permission to dump ship ballast and stone waste against the embankment to improve the defences. By 1835 a great deal of sand had accumulated against the Vale church embankment. 19th and 20th centuries In 1811, once the land had had time to drain, the majority of the recovered land was sold to six buyers, Pierre Yves Bardel, Henry Giffard, Daniel Mollet, Isaac Carre and Jean Allez. Part of the land being retained to provide a military drill ground. The ¬£5,375 raised from the sale, less the cost, was put towards the ¬£8,773 cost of improving two roads from St Peter Port to Rocquaine and to Vazon and the construction of a new road across the Braye, which became known as ‚ÄúRoute Militaire‚Äù, running from Les Banques to L'Ancresse. The rest of the cost being met from a grant of ¬£5,000 from the British Government. Fishermen petitioned Doyle on the basis that they had lost their mooring facilities. They were successful and a pier was built at Les Amarreurs at a cost of ¬£60 for their use. The owners of the reclaimed land were given an obligation to keep the Great Bridge, sluices and douits (ditches) maintained, although this obligation ended in 1872. The area of land in Guernsey materially increased with the tidal channel being turned into profitable meadows. In 1872 the States of Guernsey agreed to take over the cost of maintaining the roads and embankments from the Braye land owners upon payment of ¬£114. Following the creation of the tomato industry in Guernsey in 1841, the growing industry expanded and areas of the Braye had greenhouses built on them. To maintain the new roads, an annual charge of 2d (two pence) per perch (21 feet) of road frontage was levied. Carved granite mile stones, 60 in total in the whole Island, were installed on the main roads in 1823. The distances being measured from the Town Church. Current Certain modern day reminders of the Braye still exist. * The Vale pond, next to the Vale church is the only remnant of the original water way. Now a nature reserve. * There is an area still called the ‚ÄúSaltpans‚Äù in the Braye. * On the northern side of the Braye a length of sea wall made of boulders with rings to tie boats up to can still be found. It is now a listed monument and a path has been made along it to link Braye Road with Folie Lane, a green lane. A plaque was unveiled on 15 July 2006, on the 200th anniversary to commemorate the vision of Sir John Doyle as well as the engineering skills. * Nocq road is the location of the ‚Äúnocq‚Äù or sluice at St Sampson‚Äôs See also *Guernsey *Vale, Guernsey *Saint Sampson, Guernsey References Geography of Guernsey Guernsey-Braye du Valle Coastal construction Guernsey land reclamation ","title":"Braye du Valle, Guernsey"},{"id":"48495510","text":"Suresh Atalrai Keswani is an Indian politician.

Life and career Haraguchi was born in Tomioka in 1886. Her father was a wealthy farmer and she had two sisters. She attended Takasaki Women's High School, graduating in 1902, two years earlier than her classmates of the same age. She enrolled at Japan Women's University in 1903 to study humanities in the Faculty of English Literature. At the time, women were not allowed to earn graduate degrees or beyond at Japanese universities, and higher educational institutions for women were not yet officially recognized. Thus, when her mentor, the psychologist Matsumoto Matataro, encouraged her to pursue further education, she left Japan for the United States after graduating in 1906. Studies at Columbia University Haraguchi entered the Teachers College of Columbia University in 1907 to complete a doctorate in psychology. She focused on experimental psychology and pedagogy, and was taught by Edward Thorndike, Robert S. Woodworth and James McKeen Cattell. Her research on fatigue explored topics such as the influence of mental work on physiological processes and on the changes in mental efficiency. Her doctoral thesis, titled \\"Mental Fatigue\\", was completed under Thorndike's supervision. For her research, she completed experiments on herself in which she multiplied four-digit numbers and translated sentences of John Dewey's writing. Haraguchi earned her doctorate on 5 June 1912, becoming the first Japanese woman to attain a PhD in any field. She was married that same day. Later life in Japan Haraguchi returned to Japan, where she expanded her doctoral thesis and translated it into Japanese. It was published under the title Studies on Mental Work and Fatigue in 1914. She lectured at Japan Women's University occasionally and was involved in the establishment of an experimental psychology laboratory at the university. She also wrote a memoir, Tanoshiki omohide, \\"Pleasant memoirs\\", in 1915, in which she drew from her experiences studying at Columbia University to advocate for women's education and value. Personal life Haraguchi married Takejir≈ç Haraguchi, a Waseda University professor, on 5 June 1912. They had a son and daughter. Death and legacy Haraguchi died of tuberculosis on September 26, 1915, at age 29. Her last work, a Japanese translation of Francis Galton's Hereditary Genius (first published in 1869), was published posthumously in 1915. A record of her experiences at Columbia University and her observations of cultural differences between Japan and the U.S., Happy Memories, was also published in 1915. Two documentaries have been produced about Haraguchi's life and work: The Life of Tsuruko Haraguchi (2007) and Psychologist Tsuruko Haraguchi: Memories of Her Days at Columbia University in the Early 1900s (2008).

Anilkumar has researched on Christian symbolism with special reference to one of the Protestant Church Societies in Karnataka, the Basel Evangelical Mission, which has since unionized itself into the Church of South India. The subject of Christian symbolism is largely taken as Idolatry causing a mix-up of sorts. However, Anilkumar points out that Christian symbolism is distinct from Idolatry. Concerning Symbolism, the Theologian Louis La Ravoire Morrow drew out a secular standout as early as 1949, As such, Morrow wrote that the early Church also began using symbolism from times immemorial, As for the ambiguity in Christian symbolism, Morrow has explained that the Bible prohibits the worship of symbols but not the use of symbols as such. In such a setting, Anilkumar's work has made inroads into the world of Christian symbolism and also digs out the perspectives of the Missionaries, the ones who brought Christianity to India and the other from the perspective of the Indian Christians whose culture and ethos is rich in tradition and rituals. Pioneer Theologians like D. S. Amalorpavadass have already addressed these issues through the Second Vatican Council which voted in favour of inculturation. Much like D. S. Amalorpavadass, Anilkumar points out that Christian symbolism had a distinct meaning, each pointing out to a Biblical event and as such it could not be identified with Idolatry. Studies Anilkumar had his ministerial formation at the Karnataka Theological College, Mangalore studying during the Principalships of C. D. Jathanna and C. L. Furtado and then joined the Church of South India in 1986. After a ministerial service, he proceeded to the United Kingdom and pursued postgraduate studies at the Birmingham University where he gained a postgraduate degree in 1999 specializing in pastoral ministry and returned to Mangalore to take up his teaching ministry. For further research studies Anilkumar went to Germany where he researched at the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Regensburg on the topic of Symbolism and successfully submitted a doctoral dissertation entitledUniversit√§t Regensburg, Dissertationen f√ºr den Hochschulschriftentausch 2012.

She was the first woman in Japan to receive a Bachelor of Science. Biography Kuroda was born in 1884 in Saga Prefecture. She attended the Women's Department of Saga Normal School, graduating in 1901, and worked as a teacher for a year afterward. She entered the Division of Science at Rika Women's Higher Normal School in 1902 and graduated in 1906. She then taught at Fukui Normal School for a year before enrolling in the graduate program at Kenkyuka Women's Higher Normal School in 1907. She finished the course in 1909 and became an assistant professor at Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School. In 1913, when Tohoku Imperial University became the first of Japan's Imperial Universities to accept women students, she was admitted to the Chemistry Department of the College of Science among the first cohort of women. She was mentored by Professor Riko Majima, who inspired Kuroda's interest in organic chemistry, particularly natural pigments; he supervised her research into the purple pigment of Lithospermum erythrorhizon. She completed her Bachelor of Science in 1916, becoming the first woman in Japan to do so. Kuroda was appointed an assistant professor at Tohoku Imperial University upon graduating in 1916 and became a professor at Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School in 1918. The same year, she became the first woman to give a presentation to the Chemical Society of Japan when she presented her research on the pigment of L. erythrorhizon. She travelled to the University of Oxford in 1921, where she researched phthalonic acid derivatives under William Henry Perkin. She returned to Japan in 1923 and resumed her role as professor at Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School. In 1924, she was commissioned by the RIKEN institute to research the structure of carthamin, the pigment of safflower plants. Her thesis on the subject, \\"The Constitution of Carthamin\\", earned her a doctorate in science in 1929. She was the second woman in Japan to receive such a degree, after Kono Yasui. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Kuroda's research examined the pigments of the Asiatic dayflower, eggplant skin, black soybeans, red shiso leaves and sea urchin spines, as well as derivatives of naphthoquinone. She was awarded the Majima Prize by the Chemical Society of Japan in 1936. She was appointed professor at Ochanomizu University in 1949, and at the same time began researching the pigmentation of onion skin. Her extraction of quercetin crystals from onion skin led to the creation of Kerutin C, an antihypertensive drug. She retired in 1952, but continued to lecture at Ochanomizu University as a professor emeritus. She was awarded a Medal with Purple Ribbon in 1959 and was conferred the Order of the Precious Crown of the Third Class in 1965. She developed heart disease in 1967 and died on 8 November 1968 in Fukuoka, aged 84.

The work is one of few to use the bagpipe with a classical orchestra. A version for bagpipe and string orchestra, Op. 34a, was composed in 2001. It is based on an earlier work for bagpipe and string quartet. Jacobean Salute was also derived from the early work, with a wind quintet replacing the bagpipe, published in 2003. A version for bagpipe and orchestra was composed and first performed in 2015.  Background and history  At Scottish Highland gatherings, a \\"Salute\\" is played to honour a person, here the \\"Chieftain\\" (the Head of a Clan). Waterhouse composed the first version of Chieftain's Salute in 1994 for bagpipe and string quartet, for a fund-raising event. He wrote a version for bagpipe and string orchestra, Op. 34a, in 2001. It was premiered and first recorded with soloist Graham Waller. In 2015 Waterhouse wrote a version for bagpipe and symphony orchestra. It was first performed on 8 November 2015 at the Capitol Theater in Offenbach am Main, again with Graham Waller as the soloist and the Neue Philharmonie Frankfurt conducted by Steven Lloyd Gonz√°lez. Waterhouse derived from the first work in 1994 also Jacobean Salute, a version without bagpipe, but scored for wind quintet (flute, oboe, clarinet, horn, bassoon), and string quintet (two violins, viola, cello and double bass), with the winds mainly playing the role of the bagpipe. Glissandi of the strings imitate the blowing of the pipes (). It was premiered in 1995 and published in 2003 by Lienau in Frankfurt.  Music  The opening theme is based on \\"Lady Doyle's Salute\\", a lament from the 17th century. The strings play alone for a while, the bagpipe enters, also first playing first, then both interact, with the strings at times imitating the drones of the bagpipe. Later passages are reminiscent of the old Scottish dances jig and reel.  Performances and recording  Jacobean Salute was first performed in 1995, and notably played in a composer portrait concert at the Gasteig in Munich on 5 October 2003, along with the Piccolo Quintet, the premiere of the Bassoon Quintet, the Nonet and other chamber music, played by Burkhard J√§ckle, Lisa Outred, Albert Osterhammer, Ulrich Haider, Lyndon Watts, Odette Couch, Kirsty Hilton, Isabel Charisius, the composer and Matthias Weber (including several members of the Munich Philharmonic), conducted by Yaron Traub. The version for bagpipe and string orchestra was recorded in 2002 (released in 2004) by Graham Waller and the English Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Traub. A reviewer noted that it is \\"a deeply serious work\\", with the Highland Bagpipe \\"a real partner in this virile, rousing piece of music\\".

Tower music is a musical performance from the top of a tower. It can also designate the music composed for or played in such a performance. In the early European Middle Ages, musical instruments on towers were used to warn of danger and mark the passage of time. At first this was done by a tower watchman, later by ensembles of instrumentalists employed by the city.Die Turmmusik, Duden dictionary entry, Bibliographisches Institut GmbH The music became more choral, and came to by played on specific days of the week, and to mark specific dates (feast days such as Christmas and Easter, for instance). The practice largely died out in the late 19th century, but was revived in the early twentieth, and continues to this day.Gerlinde Haid: Turmblasen. In: Oesterreichisches Musiklexikon. Online-Ausgabe, Vienna 2002 ff., ; Druckausgabe: volume 5, edition of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna 2006, . Modern tower music is often played by volunteers. The tower used would often be a church tower, but the tower or balcony of a civic building might also be used. Wolfgang Schnabel: Die evangelische Posaunenchorarbeit. Herkunft und Auftrag. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1993, S. 174 f. (online auf Google B√ºcher) The instruments had to be audible to someone not on the tower. This eliminated the quieter (basse) instruments, leaving the louder (haut) instruments. Apart from bells, natural trumpets, slide trumpets, trombones, shawms, bagpipes, and drums were used. Music was written specifically to be played from towers, but other works could also be used. Alta capella musicians playing the tower music would generally also perform in processions and ground-level outdoor events, and in some cases would also perform (on different instruments) indoors. History Many English cities in the 1500s had town waits, as did rich individuals and institutions. In 1571, London ordered its waits to play ‚Äúupon their instruments upon the turret at the Royal Exchange every Sunday and holiday toward the evening.‚Äù (with winter break, between September to late March, excepted). These may have been London‚Äôs first regularly scheduled public concerts. London's waits also played from its walls. Timeline of trombone history, Will Kimball These civic wind bands of town pipers had been a feature of larger German towns and cities since well before the beginning of the sixteenth century, similar to the employment of waits with their sackbuts and shawms in England. Martin Luther, one of the chief figures of the Reformation, encouraged music-making in the service of God, and by around 1570 town councils were employing musicians specifically to take part in church services to supplement the organ playing. One of the most popular forms of outdoors public music-making in the 17th century in Germany and central Europe was tower music (German: Turmmusik), organised by the town piper (Stadtpfeifer) or tower master (Turmmeister). He and his band of musicians, also called Stadtpfeifer (the German plural is the same as the singular) played music for loud and penetrating wind or brass instruments from church towers and town hall balconies.Hofer, Achim (1992). Blasmusikforschung (in German). Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1992, p. 101. Generations of the Bach family in Erfurt filled the office of Stadtpfeifer or Ratsmusiker (German: 'town council musician'). By 1600 Halle, Dresden, Berlin, Cologne, Stettin, Nordhausen and even Eisenach (J. S. Bach's birthplace) with only 6,000 inhabitants, all had 'Stadpfeifers', whose job it was to sound the hours ('Stundenblasen') in the days before striking clocks were common in towers and churches. They started around 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning to start the working day, sounded (German: blasen, lit. 'blew') the mid-morning break around 10 o'clock (Latin: decima hora) and the afternoon break around three or four o'clock in the afternoon. Finally, at around 9 or 10 o'clock, there was an Abendsegen, or evening blessing. Well known pieces by and for 'Stadtpfeifer' include Johann Schein's Banchetto musicale (1617) and Samuel Scheidt's Ludi Musici (1621). In Nuremberg and Leipzig and there was a particular penchant for antiphonal tower music: three verses of a hymn would be echoed back and forth three times between the bands stationed in the towers of the Neukirche, St. Thomas Church and St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig. The Leipzig Stadtpfeifer and tower master ('Turmmeister') of St. Nicholas Church from 1669 was Johann Pezel (or Petzold, etc.) whose Hora decima musicorum Lipsiensium ('Leipzig 10 o'clock music') was published the following year,Petzel, Johann (1670). Hora decima musicorum Lipsiensium. Leipzig: G. H. Frommann. IMSLP. Retrieved 26 September 2017. as well as F√ºnff-stimmigte blasende Music (1685) with five-part intradas and dance pieces for brass instruments. Another Leipzig Stadtpfeifer and virtuoso trumpet player Gottfried Reiche (1667‚Äì1734) described tower music in his preface to Vier und zwanzig Neue Quatricinia (1696) for cornett and three trombones, as \\"a sign of joy and peace\\", an embodiment of the spiritual-cultural life of the city \\"certainly whenever the whole country is in mourning, or in war, or when other misfortune is to be lamented.\\" Although the revival of music in churches was a particularly Lutheran initiative, Catholic areas like Vienna and Salzburg were just as keen to promote tower music. Among the most popular of tunes were the Heilig-Leider, paraphrases in German of the Sanctus from the Latin Mass, which came into fashion after the enlightened reforms of the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I promoted the use of the vernacular in church services. According to one Stadtpfeifer named Hornbock, quoted in Johann Kuhnau's Quack-Salber: \\"We know from experience that when our city pipers in the festive season play a religious song with nothing but trombones from the tower, then we are greatly moved, and imagine that we hear the angels singing.\\". In Austria, trombones were typically played from church towers (German Turmblasen, lit 'tower blowing') or in cemeteries on All Souls' Day and the previous day (Hallowe'en in England). Their use is mentioned in a handbook explaining the multitude of church music regulations, Kirchenmusik-Ordnung (1828), by the Linz Stadtpfeifer Franz Gl√∂ggl. Gl√∂ggl commissioned the Three Equals from Beethoven in 1812. They were both pupils of Johann Albrechtsberger (d. 1807), who wrote one of the first trombone concertos. Tower music reached a peak in around 1750, and thereafter declined towards the end of the 18th century. From around 1800 official civic concerts began to replace those given by the nobility, and what has been termed \\"Saint Culture\\" ('St.-Kultur') suffered a split, leading on one side to the growth of professional symphony orchestras, and on the other to amateur Stadtkapellen conducted by professional or semi-professional town music directors.

Part of Cariamiformes, they are related to the still extant seriemas and the also extinct Phorusrhacidae. They were likely similar in habits, being terrestrial, long-legged predators, some of which attained massive sizes. It has been suggested that most, if not all, North American Paleogene cariamiforme fossils are part of this group.Gerald Mayr (2009).

The most recent consensus is that Bathornithidae is relegated exclusively to Bathornis, as a clade of Cariamiformes outside of a clade including seriemas and phorusrhacids, as well as a possible European specimen. Paracrax and Eutreptornis are understood to be odd taxa whose cariamiform affinities are not fully resolved. Biology Though some forms like Paracrax wetmorei might have been capable of flight, most taxa were flightless, constituting examples of flightless birds in mammal dominated environments. Paracrax gigantea, Paracrax antiqua and the larger Bathornis species in particular might have occupied macropredatory niches akin to that of phorusrhacids, the former and latter reaching heights of over Bathornis proper appears to have favoured wetland environments.

The terminology indicates the use of eight (ashta) auspicious (mangala) objects in its practice. These objects are ghee lamps (brass lamps with a wick in clarified butter), mirror, gold, milk, yogurt, fruits, book, and white cloth. The practice of ashtamangala prasnam is highly popular and held in high esteem in the Indian state of Kerala and Tulu Nadu. In fact, the author of Prasna Marga, an authoritative book on its practice was written by Narayanan Nambutiri, an astrologer from Edakad, Thalasseri in Kerala. Prasna Marga was written in 1649 CE. Prasna is one of the six important branches of Hindu astrology. It deals with horary astrology in which an astrologer attempts to answer a question by constructing a horoscope for the exact time at which the question was received and understood by the astrologer. The other branches are jataka (natal astrology) which attempts to determine an individual's personality and path in life based on the horoscope of the individual, muhurta (electional astrology) in which the practitioner decides the most appropriate time for an event based on the astrological auspiciousness of that time, nimitta (interpretation of omens), gola (study of astronomy) and ganita (study of mathematics). Outline of the Ashtamangala Prasna rituals The process begins by extending a formal invitation to an astrologer to perform an Ashtamangala Prasna. The astrologer then fixes a date for the Prasna based on the principles of electional astrology. The services of two astrologers are required for conducting the Prasna. On the day fixed for the Prasna, a priest would perform a puja of the zodiac. During that time the main astrologer would ask a girl or boy to keep the gold coin randomly in one of the twelve houses drawn on a wooden plank placed before the astrologer. Based on the house in which the coin was placed and on certain numbers computed during the process, the question-answer session begins. The full session may extend up to two days. After full diagnosis, remedial measures are finalized on the last day of Prasna. A person for performing the remedial measures is also finalized. The main astrologer prepares a report mentioning all the relevant facts and details of remedial measures. Remedial measures are arranged according to the availability of the designated person and suitability of the persons conducting the Prasna. Ashtamangala number Ashtamangala prasna uses not only omens but a lot of numerology also. One important component of the initial stages of the prasna process is the determination of the Ashtamangala number. The instrument for deriving these are cowry shells which have been specially selected, cleaned, sanctified. For prasna, 108 cowries are used. The astrologer first touches the cowries while meditating on his mantra and asking for spiritual guidance. Then the astrologer randomly divides the shells into three piles. The astrologer then goes to each pile of cowries and counts off multiples of eight and keeps the remainder; if the remainder is zero then eight cowries are retained. A three digit number is obtained this way and it is the Ashtamangala number of the prasna. The digits are supposed to be indicative of the past, present and future respectfully from left to right. Odd numbers are considered good, even numbers bad. Ashtamangala Deva Prasna Ashtamangala Prasna is used to ascertain the unknown causes of unwelcome situations and to plan remedial actions in the life of individuals and also of families. The same process when applied in the context of the life of Hindu places of worship is known as Ashtamangala Deva Prasna. This time, the queries for which answers are sought will be of a different nature. The intention would be to probe the mind of the presiding deity to decide on the activities to be performed that would enhance the spiritual ambiance of the temples. For example, the querist may wish to know whether pujas and festivals are being conducted strictly as per accepted norms, or whether there are any lapses in it, what developmental activities are likely to be pleasing to the deity, and the like.

It is managed by the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. History Rehabilitation of British Soldiers From Normandy The hospital was originally established in Baschurch by Miss Agnes Hunt as the Baschurch Children's hospital in 1900. Agnes Hunt consulted Sir Robert Jones, after whom the hospital is also named, about her own illness in 1903 and he became honorary surgeon to the hospital in 1904. The hospital moved its present site in Oswestry as the Shropshire Orthopaedic Hospital in 1921 and became the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in 1933. The hospital took in badly-injured patients under the Ministry of Health's Emergency Medical Service during the Second World War. John Charnley, the leading orthopedic surgeon, worked in the hospital for six months in 1946. It joined the National Health Service in 1948 and achieved NHS Trust status in 1994. Following a major building programme, the Midlands Centre for Spinal Injuries re-opened in 2001. The hospital was awarded NHS Foundation Trust status in August 2011. Seven-day working The hospital is a pioneer of seven-day working. Weekend work began with surgeons carrying out waiting list initiatives to deal with the problem of access times for the NHS. Researchers at the Dr Foster Intelligence Unit at Imperial College London looked at more than 4 million elective procedures across the UK in 2008-11. They found that the risk of death was 44 per cent higher if the patient was operated on a Friday and 82 per cent higher if operated on over the weekend. The Trust carries out about 10,000 procedures a year and in 2000-12 recorded 33 deaths after elective orthopaedic procedures. They found there was a lower mortality risk on Friday and on Saturday; at 0.008 per cent for Friday and 0.014 per cent on Saturday, with an average mortality rate for the trust at 0.023 per cent. Performance It was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time it had 1101 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 3.23%. 93% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 71% recommended it as a place to work. The hospital was investigated by Deloitte, a report commissioned by the trust itself, after an alert from a Whistleblower found that from December 2013 to January 2015 an average of 424 patients had been excluded from the waiting list for surgery. The effect was that the trust \\"improved the performance above the 92 per cent national target. As such, it is clear to see that without the removal of these, the trust would not have met the national target for this indicator.\\" The Trust has estimated it could to lose up to ¬£8m in income, 16% of its turnover, during 2016-17 under changes to the NHS tariff which are set to affect all specialist orthopaedic hospitals, though discussions are ongoing with Monitor and NHS England to find a solution.

He studied art in Valenciennes, then in 1923 was admitted to the √âcole des Beaux Arts in Paris. He left that school in 1934. He became a member of the T√©moignage (Testimony) group, which included Jean Le Moal, √âtienne Martin, Alfred Manessier, Jean Bertholle and Le Corbusier. He exhibited with this group in New York in 1939. He regularly exhibited at the Salon des Ind√©pendants until 1948. De P√©tigny taught in Paris at the √âcole d‚ÄôArt et Publicit√© (School of Art and Advertising). There were many reconstruction projects in Picardy in the aftermath of World War II. From 1951 de P√©tigny began to accept commissions from the Monuments Historiques. He was asked to create replacement stained glass windows for the Basilica of Saint-Quentin, which had been badly damaged during World War I (1914‚Äì18). From 1954 Hector de P√©tigny created 16 stained glass windows for the choir of the basilica in the upper levels of nine bays, each almost high. He also created the stained glass of seven medallions of almost in diameter, mounted above the windows. He made stations of the cross in churches in Vorges, Coucy-le-Ch√¢teau and Marle, and made wooden decorations for the departmental archives in Laon. In 1969 Hector de P√©tigny returned to his family home in Vorges, Aisne, where he lived the rest of his life. He died in 1992. The Association des Amis de Laon et du Laonnois has established a Hector de P√©tigny tour of the sites in northern Aisne where the artist's works may be seen with descriptive panels. Work Hector de P√©tigny worked in sculpture, painting, engraving and stained glass. His vigorous, modernist style was never completely abstract, and at one stage he experimented with surrealism. He was also interested in cubism. His use of geometric forms placed him in the \\"Second School of Paris\\" after the war.

Sauer, > The pieces are written in lyrical prose, and combine COURTLY LOVE imagery of > Christ as the perfect lover-knight with more earthy eroticism. Similarly, > the texts combine nuptial metaphors with crucifixion imagery, blending > divine marriage with shared divine pain. Jesus is at once the desired spouse > and the suffering savior. In particular, the title piece outlines all the > qualities that Christ has that make him the perfect spouse, and these are > all defined in human terms. Christ is handsome, kind, noble, wealthy, > generous, and loving. The other members of the Trinity make only rare > appearances.

Life Like his elder brother Heinrich, Franz Wilhelm Kampschulte, who was born into a moderately prosperous family, was intended by his parents for a career in the church from an early age. He attended successively three gymnasiums (secondary schools) in Brilon, Paderborn und M√ºnster, acquiring a broad humanistic education, before moving on to study Roman Catholic theology for three years at the academy in M√ºnster. Simultaneously he also studied history and philology. He then studied history for a year at Berlin, principally as a student of Ranke, before going on to prepare for his doctorate under the supervision of Carl Adolph Cornelius: he received his doctorate from Bonn University in March 1856. He was persuaded by friends and his own academic potential to abandon his intention to become a secondary school teacher, instead staying at Bonn and progressing to the further academic qualification of a habilitation in 1857. The next year he was given a professorship in history, becoming a full professor and 1860. Three years later he joined two more senior colleagues to become a joint director of the faculty. Kampschulte's lectures focused on the late Medieval and early modern periods. His own written work, with minor exceptions, was devoted to the first half of the sixteenth century. His doctoral dissertation, entitled \\"\\"De Georgio Wicelio eiusque studiis et scriptis irenicis\\"\\", concerned the reformation theologian Georg Witzel. Another important field for him was the History of the University of Erfurt during the age of humanism and the reformation. A two volume work on the topic appeared in 1858 and 1860. It is considered groundbreaking in respect of Konrad Mutian, and on the origins of the Epistol√¶ Obscurorum Virorum, and therefore important for students and scholars of German humanism. During the 1860s he turned hi attentions to Calvin. The first volume of what was intended as a three volume work, entitled \\"John Calvin: his church and his state in Geneva\\" was printed in 1869. In it he described the political and religious conflicts in Geneva. The volume then addressed Calvin's development as a reformer, his first Geneva period, his banishment from the city and his return in 1541. The themes for the second volume included Calvin's further struggles and eventual triumph in Geneva. Kampschulte died on 3 December 1872, apparently from the lung disease by which he had been troubled ever since his childhood, still working on the second volume, reportedly with his quill pen in his hand. This second volume was in the end completed by and published in 1899. The third volume never appeared. Reflections Kampschulte was a conscientious, cautious and persistent researcher. Just a few weeks before his death he was still working away in the archives at Berne on research for his second volume on the career of John Calvin. He was a friend of Franz Heinrich Reusch and Theodor Stumpf, whose theological conclusions he broadly shared. He rejected the concept of Papal infallibility, powerfully re-asserted in 1869 at the First Vatican Council by Pope Pius IX.

It is set in Prague in the 1980s and follows a young Czech writer, Jan Reichl, who becomes involved with an underground intellectual scene. Jan ends up in the United States where he later, in the early 21st century, examines his experiences. The title references Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel with the same title. The book received the bronze prize in the \\"Suspense / Thriller\\" category at the 2015 Independent Publisher Book Awards. Composition From 1979 until he was expelled from Czechoslovakia in the mid 1980s, Roger Scruton had been involved in setting up an underground university in Prague in collaboration with the dissident Ji≈ô√≠ M√ºller. Scruton noted that many of the young people he encountered could not be described as dissidents of the kind that Western media were promoting, as being a dissident had become a social status in itself, unobtainable for most people. According to Scruton, he made several failed attempts to make use of these experiences. He eventually came up with the storyline which became Notes from Underground, after which \\"the novel wrote itself\\". The title is taken from Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel Notes from Underground, and refers to the characters' inability to escape their situation. Publication The book was published on 12 March 2014 through Beaufort Books in New York City. On 17 April, the Hudson Institute organised a panel discussion about the book in Washington, D.C. featuring Scruton, the Czech ambassador to the United States Petr Gandaloviƒç, and the Danube Institute's director John O'Sullivan. Reception Meghan Cox Gurdon reviewed the book in Forbes: > Like its British author, a philosopher and public intellectual who has > published forty books and two operas, Notes from Underground is deeply > humane, sensitive and unflinching. In its elegantly-written pages we find a > quietly brutal depiction of people trying to make real lives for themselves > ‚Äì for their minds and souls ‚Äì amid the interlocking snares of > totalitarianism and its special set of lies. Through this book, we feel what > it was to breathe that stale, choking air whilst trying not to show any > feeling at all, lest it draw attention.

Ancient Romans had different names to describe their concept of family, including \\"familia\\" to describe the nuclear family and \\"domus\\" which would have included all the inhabitants of the household.Bradley, Keith R. Discovering the Roman Family: Studies in Roman Social History. New York: Oxford University Press, 1991. The types of interactions between the different members of the family were dictated by the perceived social roles each member played. An Ancient Roman family's structure was constantly changing as a result of the low life expectancy and through marriage, divorce, and adoption.Shelton, Jo-Ann. As the Romans Did: A Sourcebook in Roman Social History. 2nd ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998. Ara Pacis showing the Imperial Family of Augustus Fathers Ancient Romans placed the father at the head of the family. One definition of the term \\"familia\\" translates to \\"the group of people who descend from the same pater,\\" where pater means \\"father\\". From this definition, a father and all his children are part of his familia, as are the children of his sons. The children of his daughters, however, would become part of their father's familia. At the head of the entire familia was the paterfamilias. The paterfamilias was the oldest living male of the family. If he had living sons, even grown men with their own families, those sons would still be under the power of the paterfamilias. In Ancient Rome, fathers were endowed with nearly limitless power over their family, especially their children. This patria potestas, or \\"the father's power\\" gave him legal rights over his children until he died or his children were emancipated.Harlow, Mary, and Ray Laurence. Growing Up and Growing Old in Ancient Rome: A Life Course Approach. London: Routledge, 2002. These powers included the right to arrange marriages or force divorce, expose a new born child if he did not want him/her, and even disown, sell, or kill his child. Even though a father had these legal rights, it did not mean these acts were common. Fathers wanted their children as heirs for the continuation of their bloodlines. Ancient Romans believed the patria potestas was first dictated by Romulus, the founder and first king of Rome.Fontes Iuris Romani Antejustiniani (2nd ed.,Florence,1940-1943) Legally, if a child did not share the father's citizenship, he or she was not under his patria potestas.Dixon, Suzanne. The Roman Family. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992. Accessed October 20, 2015. ACLS Humanities eBook. Mothers Domitia Lucilla Minor, mother of Marcus Aurelius A woman in Ancient Rome was under the social expectation to become a wife and mother. Despite the importance of the mother in the family structure as the bearer of the children, she had no legal control over her children. Examples of mother-child relationships in ancient sources, if discussed at all, focus on describing her as the idealized Roman Matrona. A Roman Matrona was a strong, virtuous woman dedicated to the political advancement of her family. Marcus Aurelius provides a rare insight into the affectionate relationship between mother and son in a letter describing an afternoon spent with his mother playfully arguing and gossiping.Marcus Aurelius,Fronto's Letters, 4.6 The lack of literary discussion may have resulted because so many children never knew their mothers, who often died in childbirth. It was also the case that young children often had more contact with their wet nurse or pedagogue than their mother. Children=Starting a family The nuclear family of father, mother, and children was essential to the Ancient Roman family structure. Although mothers gave birth to many children, the size of a Roman family remained relatively small because of the high infant and child mortality rate. Twenty-five percent of infants died within their first year, while another 25% died before their tenth birthday. Such a high rate meant women had to bear multiple children because many would not make it to adulthood. However, for couples who did not want to become pregnant, there were forms of contraception available to them, as well as abortion. Life course In infancy, a new born was either accepted into the family by his/her father in a ritual called tollere liberum or the child was exposed by the father, often without the consent of the mother. Exposure differed from infanticide and the abandoned child was often taken and raised by someone else. A child was considered an infant until he/she was seven years old. At this time, boys would begin their education and be introduced to public life. Girls remained in the household to learn the skills they would need as wives and mothers. Legally, a girl was considered a child until she was twelve years old and a boy until he was fourteen years old. Young girls were often engaged at twelve years old and married at thirteen to a man chosen by her father. Males transitioned to adulthood during the toga virilis ceremony when they received the white toga worn by adults. Childhood ended for women once they were married, but they were still considered childlike because of their weaker dispositions compared to men. Sarcophagus depicting children at play Wet nurses and pedagogues Within the household, infants and children would have interacted with servants and household slaves. During infancy, babies were often nursed and cared for by wet nurses, or nutrix. Nurses were used by families of every social level and were often employed when the mother had died from childbirth, was unable to produce milk, wanted to become pregnant again quickly or was ill. A nurse, besides having a moral character, was expected to speak properly because her close interaction with her charge was highly influential to the child's development.Quintilian, The Elements of Oratory, 1.1.4-5 Pedagogues, or male tutors, were minders for both male and female children. He could be of servile or free status and was responsible for teaching the children proper etiquette and life skills. Pedagogues were also chaperons and tutors. Similarly to wet nurses, pedagogues were employed by families of all social classes. Adoption Adoption in ancient Rome Since the mortality rate of children in Ancient Rome was so high, many parents needed to adopt. This was also common if parents were unable to have children. Adoption normally occurred because of the need to have heirs to continue the family name. Most often a nephew or a grandson was adopted if the couple itself did not have a son. This was particularly prominent among the Roman emperors. , for example, adopted his grandnephew Gaius Octavius (later known as Emperor Augustus) because he had no sons to succeed him. In some instances, masters would free their slave in order to officially adopt him into the family. By doing so, the slave could take on the family name and become an heir. Elderly Greek pottery showing Aeneas carrying his elderly father The average life expectancy in Ancient Rome at birth was 27 years old. Early deaths in women were common because of the dangers of childbirth and men often died on the battlefield. Those who lived to an elderly age expected their children to take care of them. In the second century AD, laws were passed stating a son should care for his elderly father, however there was no compulsory obligation.Rawson, Beryl, and Paul Weaver, eds. The Roman Family in Italy: Status, Sentiment, Space. Oxford: Clarendon, 1999. Children cared for their elderly parents because of their belief in pietas, or a sense duty to their parents and the gods. A mythological example of pietas comes from the story of Aeneas, who carried his elderly father out of the burning city of Troy following the Trojan War. Slaves The Ancient Roman definition of domus consisted of everyone living in the household, which included slaves. Slaves were a constant presence in a Roman family. A significant example were the wet nurses and pedagogues who cared for and raised the children. Upper class Roman families often included space for their slaves in the family burial site and in exchange the slaves ensured their master received proper burial rites when he died. It was common for slaves to be manumitted, or freed, by their master and become his dependents as freedmen. It was up to the master to free a slave. Freedpersons Funerary stele for the freedman Marcus Asellius Clemens, his wife, and their freedman Freedpersons, or liberti, were ex-slaves who were freed. Although free, many liberti continued to work for their previous master. When freed, liberti took on the name of their master, thereby continuing the family name. By taking their master's name, liberti were considered part of the familia, not just the domus. Like slaves, freedmen and freedwomen, with their families, were provided burial space with the familia. Marriage Roman marriage vows The beginnings of a new Roman family began with marriage. Marriage was a means to provide sons to serve Rome. Women were married young, normally to men much older than themselves. These girls in their late teens may have already been married once before. Marriages were arranged by family members, normally the father, especially in the upper classes where marriages created political alliances. Marriage, and even divorce, did not have to be ratified by the state Treggiari, Susan. Roman Marriage. Oxford: Clarendon Press,1991. A simple agreement between both parties was the only necessity. A marriage, for the upper classes, consisted of a wedding procession, where the woman was carried from her old home to the home of her new husband, accompanied by people singing wedding songs. Once married, the wife became a part of her husband's family and gained the title of materfamilias, or \\"mother of a household\\". A wife held the same property rights as a daughter and, therefore, could not receive her husband's property until his death. Once a wife, a woman would quickly also become a mother. Society taught women that their most valuable contribution to Rome was to give birth to many sons. Divorce and remarriage Divorce and remarriage were common in Roman society. Since so many marriages were arranged, the couple did not necessarily expect romance, but did hope to live in harmony, or concordia. If a marriage did not work out, divorce was as easily obtained as the marriage had been because the state did not need to ratify either. However, it was common to consult advice from close family or friends before getting a divorce. Both the man and the woman could request a divorce. The divorce procedure usually contained a verbal formula, in which the parties confirmed the end of the marriage. A father could force his child to get a divorce through his patria potestas, even if the marriage was happy. Divorce became increasingly common in the upper classes by the end of the Republic and the beginning of the Imperial periods because so many marriages were based on politics. If a man lost favor politically, a wife might divorce him to protect her family's reputation. In a divorce, the woman's family would usually ask the husband to return her dowry. This was possible only if the wife was innocent of any offense. If her husband divorced her because of a transgression like adultery or failure to perform her duties in the home, a wife could not have her dowry returned. Remarriages were a result not only of divorce, but also of the high mortality rate in Ancient Rome. A husband could remarry if his wife died in childbirth, a wife could remarry if her husband died at war, and either could remarry if the other died from disease, an accident, or old age. Divorce and remarriage could greatly alter the family structure by creating blended families. Step parents and step siblings were often added to the family. When a man remarried his children lived in his new household and their mother, if still alive, would rarely see them again. Adultery Both men and women had affairs in Ancient Rome. The difference was it was socially acceptable for a husband to have an affair with a slave or a lower class woman. It was never acceptable for a wife to have an affair with anyone. She was expected to remain faithful to her husband, even if she knew he was having an affair. Although women had affairs, it is hard to determine how common the practice was. The only exception for a man was he was not supposed to have a relationship with another upper class, married woman. However, during the Imperial period, it became more common for men to have affairs with upper class women. Some literature from Ancient Rome even gave advise on the best location to meet a mistress. In Ovid's poem, The Art of Love, he describes meeting women at a public location, like the circus or a horse race, to avoid detection.Ovid,The Art of Love, 1.135-163 Because married couples had separate bedrooms, it was easy for a man to have an affair, but a woman was closely monitored by the household staff, which made having an affair within her own home almost impossible. If a cheating wife was caught by her husband with her lover, her husband had the legal right to kill the adulterer and immediately divorce his wife.Acta Divi Augusti(Rome, 1945),/ Kinship terms The kinship terms in the Latin language follow the Sudanese kinship system. Latin has a word for every role in the system. The terminology used by anthropologists when analyzing kinship in cultures is often derived from Latin (words like amitalocality, patrilineal).

It was built next to the Institute for the Deaf which had already been completed on the glacis in front of Kastellet in 1838. The Institute for the Deaf had been built as am arrowhead-shaped revelin which could easily be converted into a defensive structure in the event of an enermy attack. Ferdinand Meldahl was charged with the design of the building. Construction began in 1957 and it was completed in 1858. The three-winged complex had room for 60 students, 30 boys and 30 girls, housed in each their lateral wing. The main wing contained various workshops and activity rooms. The institution opened in 1858 with 25 students and with J. Moldenhawer as its first principal. The building was expanded with a new rear wing in 1880. Rooms for 40 new students were created in the main wing while most of the workshops and activity rooms were moved to the new wing.

Description It is a single-story, single-pile, wood-framed structure, with a front gable roof and weatherboard siding. Shed-roof additions extend to either side, and there is bargeboard trim on the gables. History The house was built in 1860 by Thomas A. Boone and was originally located at 702 W. Second Avenue. During the U.S. Civil War, following the Union Army capture of Little Rock, Arkansas, the citizens of Pine Bluff asked that a Union garrison be stationed there for their protection. General Frederick Steele sent the 5th Kansas Cavalry and 1st Indiana Cavalry to Pine Bluff to establish a post. Union Army Colonel Powell Clayton established his headquarters and home in the Boone-Murphy house. in 1863. In October 1863 a band of Confederate spies raided Clayton's headquarters. They were able to secure intelligence on Union army activities but failed to capture Clayton. Following the Civil War, Clayton mortgaged the house to Robert S. Thompson and William H. Dupuy, and when the loan was not paid the house was sold to John P. Murphy. The Murphy's lived in the house until 1892. Following John Murphy's death, his widow remarried Charles F. Moore. The Boone‚ÄìMurphy House has been restored to a 1920s appearance and is owned and operated by the Heckatoo Heritage Foundation. In 2014, the house was used by a Pine Bluff Community Watch program. In 1977, the home was relocated to West 4th Avenue to ensure that it would be located in a historic district. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 18, 1979.

She is a transgender woman who identifies as queer. Tourmaline is most notable for her work in transgender activism and economic justice, through her work with the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, Critical Resistance and Queers for Economic Justice. In 2017, she edited the book Trap Door: Trans Cultural Production and the Politics of Visibility, with co-editors Eric A. Stanley and Johanna Burton. The book is part of a series called Critical Anthologies in Art and Culture by MIT Press. Early life Tourmaline grew up in a feminist household in Massachusetts. Her mother is a union organizer and her father is a self-defense instructor and anti-imprisonment advocate. Her sibling Che Gossett is a scholar studying AIDS activism and anti HIV criminalization work. Tourmaline and Che went to a bilingual elementary school in Roxbury where \\"the teachers were abusive,\\" and later attended suburban schools where they \\"went from living in poverty to going to school with wealthy people like Mitt Romney's kids.\\" Tourmaline moved to New York City for college in 2002 and has lived there ever since. Education Tourmaline attended Columbia University. She received a B.A. in Comparative Ethnic Studies. While at Columbia, she served on the President's Council on Student Affairs, a group which sought to advise the president on professors intimidating Jewish and pro-Israel students amidst the MEALAC Scandal. She was also a chaplain's associate and a member of Students Promoting Empowerment and Knowledge. In addition, she taught creative writing classes at Rikers Island in New York.Stanley, Eric A., and Nat Smith. Captive Genders: Trans Embodiment and the Prison Industrial Complex. Edinburgh: AK Press, 2015. p. 359. Activism Tourmaline has worked at various organizations dealing with transgender activism, economic justice, and prison abolition. She served as the Membership Coordinator for Queers for Economic Justice. At the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, she served as the Director of Membership. She has been a featured speaker about transgender issues at GLAAD. Along with Critical Resistance, Tourmaline organized a campaign with low income LGBTGNC that prevented the NYC Department of Corrections from building a $375 million jail in the Bronx.Lederman, Diane. \\"Hampshire College, which couldn't get Beyonce, President Obama or Bernie Sanders, replaces commencement speaker to address student gripes.\\" MassLive.com, 04 May 2016. Tourmaline has done prison abolition work through a video series, titled No One is Disposable: Everyday Practices of Prison Abolition, with Dean Spade. Tourmaline has also performed work as a community historian for drag queens and transgender individuals around the Stonewall Inn rebellion, observing how archives and repositories rarely prioritize saving transgender artist materials. Instead, Tourmaline has stated that these materials are typically \\"accidentally archived.\\" Tourmaline has combated this with contemporary trans focused projects, including Tumblr blogs, such as The Spirit Was..., and podcasts. Tourmaline was featured in Brave Spaces: Perspectives on Faith and LGBT Justice (2015), which was produced by Marc Smolowitz and screened as a Human Rights Campaign event. In January 2016, Tourmaline publicly supported a protest of the A Wider Bridge reception at the National LGBTQ Task Force's Creating Change conference in Chicago, which was intended to honor the leaders of Jerusalem Open House, the Israeli LGBTQ center. The protest, which turned violent, was characterized as anti-Semitic by opponents, although it featured a Shabbat service and was co-organized by the group Jewish Voice for Peace. Films Tourmaline has made numerous films about trans activism. STAR People Are Beautiful People (2009), co-produced with Sasha Wortzel, documents the life and work of Sylvia Rivera and STAR (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries). Her next work, also co-produced with Wortzel, Happy Birthday, Marsha!, explores the life of activist Marsha P. Johnson. Trans women played every major role in the film and queer and trans activists volunteered at the event.Happy Birthday, Marsha! Explores the story of Marsha \\"Pay it No Mind\\" Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, two best friends at the cusp of the 1969 stonewall riots. It begins after a disappointing day when Marsha attempts to celebrate her birthday and no one attends all while Sylvia tries to introduce her lover to her family for the first time, it proves unsuccessful and Sylvia unintentionally forgets her best friend's birthday party. Through this unrelenting day, the womxn experience street harassment, police violence, and isolation before meeting at the Stonewall Inn to celebrate Marsha's birthday. The night ends differently than expected, causing the two to face difficult decisions that change history.https://filmmakermagazine.com/87120-kickstarting-trans-visibility-on- screen-sasha-wortzel-on-funding-happy-birthday-marsha/ In October 2017, Tourmaline alleged that filmmaker David France plagiarized her grant submission to the Arcus Foundation to create the documentary The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson, which debuted on Netflix on October 6. Tourmaline and collaborator Sasha Wortzel were applying for a grant for financial assistance to release their short film, Happy Birthday, Marsha. This claim was supported by transgender activist Janet Mock. France denied the allegation. Independent investigations launched by both Jezebel and The Advocate exonerated France and concluded that Gossett's allegations against him were without merit. The debate has brought up questions around cultural appropriation, who owns archival footage, and what constitutes an original creative idea.

History and architecture The Cotton Annex was built from 1936 and 1937 for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).Sitting on our Assets: The Cotton Annex, Robert A. Peck, Commissioner, Public Buildings Service, U.S. General Services Administration, testimony for the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management of the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure (March 22, 2012). The building was originally for offices and laboratories of the USDA's Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE), which was previously housed in headquarters that were being demolished as part of the expansion of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The site selected for the Cotton Annex was in accordance with the 1901 McMillan Plan. Funds for the construction were appropriated by Congress in the Public Buildings Act of 1926. The Cotton Annex was designed by the Supervising Architect of the Treasury, Louis A. Simon. It is a six-story brick building in the Stripped Classical architectural style. The Cotton Annex \\"has distinctive walls of variegated buff-colored brick laid in an all-stretcher bond, and is covered with a flat roof with limestone coping and a tall parapet roof on the west and north elevations.\\" The Cotton Annex was the headquarters of the USDA Cotton Division from the building's completion until 1964, when the Cotton Division's Standards section moved to Memphis, Tennessee. Other USDA divisions moved into the empty laboratory space, and other offices of the Cotton Division remained in the Cotton Annex until 1982. In 1982, the General Services Administration (GSA) acquired ownership of the building. The USDA vacated the building in 2007, giving maintenance and repair responsibilities to the GSA. In October 2007, the GSA and the Federal Protective Service (FPS) entered an agreement for the FPS to use land on the Cotton Annex complex as a screening facility for inspection of trucks making deliveries to the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center. The building itself, however, remains vacant. In May 2007, the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management of the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure held a \\"field hearing\\" at the Cotton Annex. Chairman John Mica of Florida, a Republican, pressured the GSA to sell the building. GSA Public Buildings Service Commissioner Bob Peck testified that although the complex's operation costs are $279,000, the FPS covers those costs as part of the rental agreement for the property. In April 2014, GSA Administrator Dan Tangherlini proposed making a deal with developers to trade the Cotton Annex and the GSA's own regional headquarters in exchange for work on the GSA's main headquarters and the long-delayed Department of Homeland Security consolidation project, a project to build a new consolidated DHS headquarters at the former St. Elizabeths Hospital site in Southwest DC. February 9, 2017, Jemal Cotton Annex LLC bought the Cotton Annex with a bid of $30.3 million.

The canonical line bundle is defined for any Gorenstein scheme over a field, and its properties are much the same as in the special case of smooth schemes. Related properties For a Gorenstein scheme X of finite type over a field, f: X ‚Üí Spec(k), the dualizing complex f!(k) on X is a line bundle (called the canonical bundle KX), viewed as a complex in degree ‚àídim(X).Hartshorne (1966), Proposition V.9.3. If X is smooth of dimension n over k, the canonical bundle KX can be identified with the line bundle Œ©n of top-degree differential forms.Hartshorne (1966), section III.1. Using the canonical bundle, Serre duality takes the same form for Gorenstein schemes as it does for smooth schemes. Let X be a normal scheme of finite type over a field k. Then X is regular outside a closed subset of codimension at least 2. Let U be the open subset where X is regular; then the canonical bundle KU is a line bundle. The restriction from the divisor class group Cl(X) to Cl(U) is an isomorphism, and (since U is smooth) Cl(U) can be identified with the Picard group Pic(U). As a result, KU defines a linear equivalence class of Weil divisors on X. Any such divisor is called the canonical divisor KX. For a normal scheme X, the canonical divisor KX is said to be Q-Cartier if some positive multiple of the Weil divisor KX is Cartier. (This property does not depend on the choice of Weil divisor in its linear equivalence class.) Alternatively, normal schemes X with KX Q-Cartier are sometimes said to be Q-Gorenstein. It is also useful to consider the normal schemes X for which the canonical divisor KX is Cartier. Such a scheme is sometimes said to be Q-Gorenstein of index 1. (Some authors use \\"Gorenstein\\" for this property, but that can lead to confusion.) A normal scheme X is Gorenstein (as defined above) if and only if KX is Cartier and X is Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay.Koll√°r & Mori (1998), Corollary 5.69. Examples *An algebraic variety with local complete intersection singularities, for example any hypersurface in a smooth variety, is Gorenstein.Eisenbud (1995), Corollary 21.19. *A variety X with quotient singularities over a field of characteristic zero is Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay, and KX is Q-Cartier. The quotient variety of a vector space V by a linear action of a finite group G is Gorenstein if G maps into the subgroup SL(V) of linear transformations of determinant 1. By contrast, if X is the quotient of C2 by the cyclic group of order n acting by scalars, then KX is not Cartier (and so X is not Gorenstein) for n ‚â• 3. *Generalizing the previous example, every variety X with klt (Kawamata log terminal) singularities over a field of characteristic zero is Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay, and KX is Q-Cartier.Koll√°r & Mori (1998), Theorems 5.20 and 5.22. *If a variety X has log canonical singularities, then KX is Q-Cartier, but X need not be Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay. For example, any affine cone X over an abelian variety Y is log canonical, and KX is Cartier, but X is not Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay when Y has dimension at least 2.Koll√°r (2013), Example 3.6.

Format=2015‚Äì16 Each episode featured a panel of guests, led by two regular hosts; journalist Greg Rust and former championship-winner Mark Skaife. They were normally joined on the panel by a rotating selection of two current Supercars Championship drivers, as well as contributions from at least one other expert commentator. These contributors included former drivers, journalists and even outsiders to the sport, such as former netball player Liz Ellis. The series featured event previews and reviews, as well as extended pre-recorded interviews with major figures from the category. The show aired on Tuesdays at 7.30pm on Fox Sports 5, and was repeated various times during the week on the network. It also airs on Sky Sport in New Zealand. 2017 In 2017 the show was re-launched with Fox Sports journalist Jessica Yates taking over from Rust as host of the show. Skaife and Neil Crompton remained as senior panellists, with Rust joining the three in hosting several special episodes at team workshops in between events. History In late 2013 it was announced that Fox Sports, in a shared deal with Network Ten, had acquired the broadcast rights for what was then known as the V8 Supercars series, as of the 2015 season. To accompany their new coverage of the category, in early 2015 Fox Sports launched both this series as well as the documentary-style Supercars Life series. The first episode was broadcast on 3 March, two days after the opening event of the 2015 season; the 2015 Clipsal 500 Adelaide. The episode featured James Courtney, the winner of the Adelaide event, and Scott McLaughlin as the inaugural driver guests, with Liz Ellis and Riana Crehan also joining Rust and Skaife on the panel. The series returned for 2016 on 8 March, two days after the 2016 Clipsal 500 Adelaide. The episode featured the event winner Nick Percat and one of the Saturday pole-sitters Scott Pye as driver guests. Russell Ingall joined the series as a semi-regular panellist in 2016, while Neil Crompton provided feature interviews with team managers. In 2017, the series was re-launched on Wednesday nights, with Yates taking over as host from Rust as one of various changes to the format and presentation of the show. Demise In early 2018 it was announced that the show would not return, with the studio-based show to be replaced by a new show, Supercars Trackside. The new show airs on the Thursday and Sunday nights of each event in the Supercars Championship and features Yates, Skaife and Ingall as the main presenters.

The original Wath Brow RL, or Northern Union as it was originally known, was founded in 1898, when a Mr. Wilson represented Cumberland in the first ever County Championship against Cheshire. Rugby football had been played in the Wath Brow area of Cleator Moor for many years before the schism of 1895. The original Hornets club was formed in 1898, just a few years after the breakaway and decided to play the northern union code of rugby. The club disbanded in 1904. A new club with the same name was formed in 1920. This club however, disbanded at the start of World War II in 1939.

Fenal√•r is a very popular dish in Norway and is often served with other preserved food at a Christmas buffet or at Norwegian Constitution Day. Curing time is normally about three months, but fenal√•r may be matured for a year or more. In some parts of the region, especially in the Voss area, the leg is also slightly smoked (using a cold smoke process) before curing to prevent any mould-related problems that may occur when drying meat in a humid, mild climate. It is still quite common for many Norwegians to salt and cure the meat at home. The finished meat is dark red to brown in color. Fresh cut slices of high quality fenal√•r are smooth, tender and somewhat shiny, but not moist. The taste is slightly sweetish and not too salty. The meat must have a pronounced, but never rancid, taste of mutton. thumbFirst stage of dry salting. The leg will be covered with salt and stored in a cool place for 3-5 days. Normally the meat is served as thin slices, but it is also common‚Äîat informal gatherings‚Äîto send the leg around the table with a sharp, stubby knife. The guests then slice the leg themselves. Thus, in western Norway fenal√•r is called spikkekj√∏tt, literally \\"whittle-meat\\", but this name may also originate from the word speke, to cure. Fenal√•r is sometimes served with sour cream porridge (r√∏mmegraut), Scrambled eggs, a dill and double cream based, lukewarm potato salad and oven baked Bergen-style \\"water-pretzels\\" are other typical combinations.

Linden had to struggle to gain a university place, a degree and a doctorate because of her gender. In name only, she became one of Germany's first professors. She patented a type of bandage and won a prize for her investigations of butterfly wings. She was driven from office as a result of the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany. Early life Linden was born to a German aristocratic family who resided at near Heidenheim, Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, in 1869. Her parents Edward and Eugenie von Linden arranged for her to attend a school in Karlsruhe for four years where she received a lady's education. She showed ability and enthusiasm for maths and physics. On her return to the family's castle she had her first paper on the mineral deposits in the River H√ºrbe read at Karlsruhe's geological society (by a man) in 1890. The paper was noticed by geologist Professor von Quenstedt from University of T√ºbingen.Maria von Linden, Rheinische-Geschichte.lvr.de, Retrieved 9 November 2015 Career Schloss Burgberg in 2014.

Linden with her dog in 1902 The following year after private tutoring she was the first woman in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg to take the Reifepr√ºfung examination. This was possible because she had clearance from a minister and this examination showed that she had the academic ability, if not the gender, to attend a German university. Linden had to be content with private lessons from university professors at T√ºbingenshe failed to gain an official place, despite pressure from her uncle, who had been a minister. In lieu, by a vote of 8 to 10, she was allowed to be a guest student. Her studies at the university were financed and supported by the German Association of Female Citizens. She continued her interest in maths, physics and writing papers on natural history as she learnt about Lamarkian evolution from the zoologist Theodor Eimer. Under Eimer's guidance she was awarded a degree and in 1895 she completed her thesis on the evolution of a snail's shell and she was awarded a doctorate in Natural Science. She worked as an assistant to Eimer until his death in 1899. In 1903 she was awarded the Da Gama Machado prize for her work on the development of colour in butterfly wings and by 1908 she was in Bonn where she led a new Institute of Parasitology. She researched the causes and symptoms of tuberculosis and other lung diseases. She believed that copper may provide a therapy for tuberculosis. Whilst she was in Bonn she took Frau von Altenburg as her companion. Linden became the first woman (or one of the first) to be made a titular Professor in Germany in 1910. Despite the disapproval of the Prussian Ministry of Education, this gave her the rank of Professor but she was not allowed to teach. Linden received a patent for her discovery that copper salts could be used as a disinfectant; a bandaging company later included this idea in their products. Linden sold the family castle as she needed the money and the rise of the Nazis meant that she had to leave her job. She emigrated with Frau von Altenburg to Liechtenstein. Death and legacy Linden died of pneumonia on 25 August 1936 in Schaan, Liechtenstein. She patented a type of bandage and won a prize for her investigations of butterfly wings and was awarded a patent for her discovery that copper salts could be used as a disinfectant. In 1999, a secondary school in Calw was named after her. It's the Maria-von-Linden-Gymnasium, which is a German type grammar school focusing on sciences. Also known as Linden may also be known as: Maria von Linden; Maria Gr√§fin von Linden; Maria Gr√§fin von Linden-Aspermont; Maria von Linden- Aspermont; or Linden-Aspermont.

Early years (1883‚Äì1919 L√©on Jean Jacques Bar√©ty was born in Nice on 18 October 1883. His father was Alexandre Bar√©ty, an eminent doctor who was a general councilor of the Alpes-Maritimes from 1880 to 1904. L√©on Bar√©ty received his secondary education in the lyc√©e of Nice, then obtained a diploma in Finance from the Ecole des sciences politiques, followed by a doctorate in Law from the Faculty of Paris. His thesis was on the evolution of local banks in France and Germany. In 1905 Bar√©ty was attached to the office of the Minister of the Interior. In 1910 he was elected councilor-general of the Alpes-Maritimes for the Puget-Th√©niers canton, an office he held for thirty years. In 1912 he was appointed deputy chief of staff to Paul Deschanel, president of the Chamber of Deputies. He served in the armed forces in World War I (1914‚Äì18), and was demobilized in June 1919. National politics (1919‚Äì41) Bar√©ty was elected deputy for the Alpes-Maritimes on 16 November 1919 on the Left Democratic Republican list. He was reelected on the same list on 11 May 1924. He was a member of the colonial group in the Chamber of Deputies. He became vice- president of this group, and president of the Morocco and Tunisia group. Bar√©ty felt that different forms of rule should be used for different cultural groups, and should be compatible with the local beliefs, laws and customs. In 1924 he pointed out the dilemma of education in the colonies. He said \\"it would be criminal to leave our native subjects in ignorance\\". On the other hand, education might \\"create rebels, discontented, d√©class√© natives ... plant seeds of rancor in the people who prepare to revolt.\\" He recommended a policy of association rather than assimilation. Bar√©ty was reelected on the Left Republicans list on 22 April 1928. He was under-secretary of state for Public Education, responsible for technical education, in the first cabinet of Andr√© Tardieu (13 November 1929 ‚Äì 21 February 1930). He was under-secretary of state for the Budget in the second Tardieu cabinet from 2 March 1930 to 14 December 1930. He was elected president of the general council of the Alpes-Maritimes in 1932. In 1932 he published la France au Maroc (France in Morocco), which won awards from the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise and the Acad√©mie des sciences morales et politiques. Bar√©ty was reelected to the Chamber of Deputies on the Left Republicans list on 1 May 1932. He was reelected on the list of the Left Republican and Radical Independent Alliance on 26 April 1936. He was Minister of Industry and Commerce in the cabinet of Paul Reynaud from 18 May 1940 to 5 June 1940. He voted in favor of giving Marshal Philippe P√©tain full powers on 10 July 1940. Bar√©ty was appointed a member of the Vichy national council during the German occupation of France. He said later, \\"I did not refuse my appointment to this Council because I thought I would be able to bring to the Government the voice of the country's complaints‚Äîand that is what I did.\\" Later career (1941‚Äì71) Due to his vote on 10 July 1940 Bar√©ty was rendered ineligible for public office after the Liberation of France. He asked for a jury of honor to reverse this ruling, saying, \\"You have to remember the situation of France in late June 1940, the complete disarray of the population, the exodus of millions of inhabitants, a completely disorganized army whose leaders themselves asked them to lay down their arms.\\" On 24 April 1945 the jury rejected his request. He appealed to the Council of State, which annulled the jury's decision and referred the case to another jury. This jury eventually removed his ineligibility on 17 October 1947. In March 1953 Bar√©ty was elected municipal councilor for Puget-Th√©niers. He did not seek reelection in 1957. He became a corporate director, and in 1958 was president of the French committee for Expo 58 in Brussels. In 1960 he was president of the Paris-based International Bureau of Exhibitions (BIE), which decided which city would hold the World Fair each year. L√©on Bar√©ty died in Nice on 10 February 1971. He was a commander of the Legion of Honour and a Grand Officer of the Belgian Order of Leopold.

The incipient wave that became Dennis emerged over the Atlantic Ocean on June 29 and moved briskly to the west. Dry air initially inhibited development, though once this abated the wave was able to consolidate into a tropical depression on July 4\\\\. The depression soon crossed Grenada before entering the Caribbean Sea whereupon increasingly favorable environmental factors, such as low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, fueled intensification. Turning west-northwest, the system achieved tropical storm status on July 5 and hurricane status the following day. Formation of a well- defined eye and central dense overcast signaled Dennis's intensification into a major hurricane. The powerful storm soon struck Granma Province, Cuba, as a Category 4 early on July 8; violent winds battered the province and caused extensive damage. Paralleling the western coast of Cuba, Dennis attained its peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) later that day before making a second landfall in the country, this time in Matanzas Province. Interaction with the mountains of Cuba caused significant weakening; however, once Dennis emerged over the Gulf of Mexico on July 9, it was able to quickly reorganize. The hurricane reached Category 4 strength for a third time on July 10 as it approached Florida, weakening somewhat before striking the state. Dramatic weakening ensued once the cyclone moved ashore. Dennis lingered as a tropical depression and remnant low for roughly a week, traversing the Mississippi River Valley and Ohio River Valley before finally dissipating over Ontario on July 18\\\\. Origins Tropical Depression Four upon its classification as a tropical cyclone on July 4, just north of Tobago. On June 26, 2005, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave well-inland over Africa. The feature was tracked via radiosonde observations from various nations for two days before being analyzed as a surface feature on June 28 over western Senegal. Accompanied by scattered convection‚Äîshower and thunderstorm activity‚Äîthe westward moving system featured some cyclonic flow; it emerged over the Atlantic Ocean early on June 29. Conflicting observations from Dakar, Senegal, made tracking the wave difficult, with surface observations revealing a clear shift in wind direction and upper-level soundings showing no change. Regardless of the exact position of the system, accompanying convection soon diminished and the system became ill-defined. By June 30, the system grew significantly and multiple low-level circulations developed within the broader cyclonic envelope. Weather models at the time depicted a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis in the subsequent days. Gradual development ensued over the following days, though the broad circulation initially remained largely devoid of convection due to dry air associated with the Saharan Air Layer. Two distinct low-level centers became apparent on July 2 as the overall system progressed west. Surface observations from the Windward Islands and Guyana depicted a broad circulation; however, satellite animations failed to show a defined center, inhibiting its classification as a tropical cyclone. The westernmost of the two centers moved across the Windward Islands early on July 4 and lost organization soon thereafter. Banding features developed with the eastern circulation throughout the day, consolidating around a 1012 mbar (hPa; 29.89 inHg) low. Later on July 4, upper-level outflow‚Äîan anticyclonic feature that provides thermal ventilation for tropical cyclones and allows for further development‚Äîbecame increasingly prominent. With continued organization, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Four at 18:00 UTC at which time it was situated east of St. George's, Grenada. Intensification and Cuban landfalls Tropical Storm Dennis organizing over the eastern Caribbean Sea on July 6 Embedded within deep east-southeasterly flow and along the periphery of a subtropical ridge, the depression moved rapidly along a west-northwest course; it soon made landfall over Grenada at 21:00 UTC on July 4 with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). Upon entering the Caribbean Sea, deep convection flared over the system. Environmental conditions ahead of the depression favored intensification into a hurricane, with little to no wind shear‚Äîanalyzed to be roughly 25 mph (35 km/h) below average‚Äîand high sea surface temperatures around present along its path. Based on satellite intensity estimates obtained through the Dvorak technique, the depression is assessed to have become a tropical storm by 12:00 UTC on July 5\\\\. Accordingly, the NHC assigned it the name Dennis at this time. This marked the earliest formation of a season's fourth named storm on record; however, this was later surpassed by Tropical Storm Debby of 2012 which was named on June 23. Throughout July 6, convection steadily consolidated as the system acquired a more northerly component to its track. Hurricane Hunters investigating Dennis found steadily falling barometric pressures, indicative of intensification. Around 22:00 UTC, observation from the aircraft indicated that Dennis achieved hurricane-strength; a central pressure of 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg) and flight-level winds of were measured. A central dense overcast soon blossomed over the hurricane's center while microwave satellite imagery depicted a closed, well-defined mid-level eye. At this point, the only factor inhibiting development was interaction with the mountains of Hispaniola and Jamaica. Dennis developed unusually prominent outflow, especially along its western side, for its location and time of year due in part to an unseasonably weak trough over the mid-Atlantic. Hurricane Dennis shortly before making landfall in Matanzas Province, Cuba, on July 8 as a Category 4\\\\. Rapid intensification ensued throughout July 7, as Dennis turned more northwest and tracked through the Jamaica Channel. A well-defined, eye formed within the hurricane's central dense overcast that evening. Dennis achieved major hurricane status by 18:00 UTC and Category 4 status by 00:00 UTC on July 8 as it approached southern Cuba. An abbreviated eyewall replacement cycle likely took place during this period as the eye expanded to in diameter. Reconnaissance flying in the storm reported flight-level winds of , and based on this Dennis is estimated to have reached its initial peak with surface winds of 140 mph (225 km/h). Around 02:45 UTC, Dennis briefly moved over Granma Province, Cuba, with its center crossing the coast near Punta del Ingl√©s (close to Cabo Cruz). Violent and destructive winds battered the province. A weather station in Cabo Cruz reported sustained winds of and a gust to before being destroyed. Interaction with land caused slight weakening; however, Dennis soon emerged over the Gulf of Guacanayabo and the region's shallow, warm waters fueled an abrupt reorganization. The hurricane traveled along the western spine of the Jardines de la Reina archipelago, subjecting the islands to Category 3 and 4 strength winds. Paralleling the coast of Cuba, Dennis attained its peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) around 12:00 UTC on July 8. Hurricane Hunters observed flight- level winds of and a pressure of 938 mbar (hPa; 27.70 inHg) around this time. The former value indicated surface winds around Category 5 strength while the latter yielded slightly lower winds, via a pressure-wind relationship method. The aforementioned peak strength was chosen accordingly as a compromise between the conflicting data. Another eyewall replacement cycle took place soon after this peak and slight weakening ensued. Around 18:45 UTC, Dennis made its second landfall in Cuba near Punta Mangles Altos in Matanzas Province with winds of 140 mph (225 km/h); a gust of was reported in Cienfuegos. Despite moving over land, weakening was initially slow due to the hurricane's proximity to water. Nearly six hours after moving ashore, Uni√≥n de Reyes was subjected to sustained winds of and gusts up to . Gulf of Mexico and dissipation Hurricane Dennis hours before making landfall along the Florida Panhandle on July 10 Maintaining its northwesterly course, Dennis emerged over the Gulf of Mexico just north of Havana around 05:00 UTC on July 9. Prolonged interaction with the mountains of Cuba severely disrupted the hurricane's core, though it managed to retain a ragged wide eye. By the time Dennis emerged over water, its maximum winds fell to 85 mph (140 km/h) and its pressure rose to 973 mbar (hPa; 28.74 inHg). Situated along the western periphery of a ridge, a gradual turn to the north-northwest ensued. A cool eddy temporarily halted notable reorganization; however, once Dennis cleared this eddy it was able to strengthen. Starting at 18:00 UTC, the hurricane underwent rapid intensification \\"at a rate that bordered on insane\\", as described by forecaster Jack Beven. In the subsequent 18 hours, its central pressure fell by 32 mbar (hPa; 0.95 inHg), including a drop of 11 mbar (hPa; 0.32 inHg) in 1 hour and 35 minutes. Hot towers extending to were observed during the strengthening. The intensification culminated with Dennis attaining winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) at 06:00 UTC on July 10 and reaching its lowest pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.47 inHg) at 12:00 UTC. This ranked Dennis as the strongest pre-August hurricane in the Atlantic basin; however, this was eclipsed just six days later by Hurricane Emily which was the first July Category 5 on record. At this time, the hurricane was situated roughly southwest of Tallahassee, Florida. Although Dennis featured a large circulation with tropical storm-force winds extending up to 230 mi (370 km) from its center, its core was compact and hurricane-force winds only stretched 40 mi (65 km) outward. During the latter part of July 10, Dennis traversed an area with lower ocean heat content. Coupled with entrainment of mid- to upper- level dry air, notable weakening took place as the hurricane approached the Florida Panhandle. Around 19:30 UTC, Dennis made its third and last landfall as a major hurricane over Santa Rosa Island, between Navarre Beach and Gulf Breeze, with estimated winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a pressure of 946 mbar (hPa; 27.94 inHg). A Florida Coastal Management Program tower in Navarre observed sustained winds of and a gust to . Dramatic weakening ensued once the hurricane moved onshore, with winds falling below tropical storm-force in just 12 hours. Upon weakening to a depression on July 11, handling of operational advisories was transferred from the NHC to the Weather Prediction Center (formerly the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center). The lingering depression continued north-northwest through the Mississippi River Valley and gradually slowed. Weakening steering currents caused Dennis to slow and turn northeast as it traversed the Ohio River Valley on July 12‚Äì13. Dennis's circulation became elongated and the system degenerated into a non-convective remnant low by 12:00 UTC on July 13 as it moved across Illinois. Thereafter, the cyclone executed a prolonged clockwise loop over the state before accelerating northeast on July 16. During this period, a band of heavy precipitation set up over the southern Appalachian Mountains; record rain fell across northern Georgia, with localized totals exceeding . The remnants later crossed the Great Lakes before being absorbed into a larger extratropical cyclone over Ontario on July 18.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is believed to have been built during the Cholas period in the 10th century. The temple has received gracious endowments from the Chola queen Sembiyan Mahadevi. Shiva is worshipped as Chandramowleeswarar and his consort Parvathi as Amirthambigai. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a seven-tiered Rajagopuram, the gateway tower. The temple is open from 6 am - 1 pm and 4 pm -8:30 pm on all days except during new moon days when it is open the full day. Four daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Chitrapournami festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Panguni (April - May), the float festival for Chandramowleeswarar during the Tamil month of Vaikasi, and the Kanum Pongal festival during the Tamil month of Thai are the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. It is located close to the Auroville and National Fossil Wood Park also in Thiruvakkarai.VCK candidate vows to put Vanur on tourism map, The Hindu newspaper, 12-May-2016These trees speak, but not many hear, The Hindu newspaper, 2-Nov-2014 Legend thumb As per Hindu legend, Vishnu killed a demon king Vakrasura. Kali destroyed Vakrasura's sister Dhunmuki. Since Dhummuki was pregnant, she pulled out the child from the womb and wore it as an ear ring in her right ear. Since Kali slayed the sister of Vakrasura, she came to be known as Vakrakali and the place came to be known as Thiruvakkarai. It is believed that Adi Shankara quelled her anger by installing a Srichakra in her left leg. The place is called Vakra Shanti Tiruthalam. The shrine of Kali is modelled similar to the Durga shrine at Thenupuriswarar Temple at Patteeswaram, Brahma Chamundeeswari Chidambaram and Thillai Kali at Chidambaram. Usually Kali temples are located in the outskirts of the village, but the shrine of Kali is located inside a Shiva temple only at Thiruvakkarai. History thumb The exact year of building could not be ascertained from the inscriptions, but the stone structure of Chandramowleeswarar shrine in its current form, is built during the time of Chola king Aditya I (870 - 907 CE). The inscriptions on the two sides of the Southern shrine of the temple indicate an endowment from Aditya for perpetual lighting of lamps in the temple. Theerthavari, the sacred bathing of the presiding deity during the auspicious days in the Tamil month of Puratasi (September - October). The temple has another inscription in the second precinct during the time of Uttama Chola (970-985 CE) for the maintenance and worship of Chandramowleeswarar and Varadaraja Perumal afforded to four able men. During the reign of Raja Raja Chola I (984-1015 CE), a village named Manali was gifted to the temple - the inscription indicates that the temple was built by Sembiyar Mahadevi. The structure of the Vishnu shrine is believed to have expanded during the reign of Rajendra Chola I (1012-1044). A bilingual inscription in the Vishnu temple indicates that the Kota Chola Vimanan built by Kota Chola was rebuilt during the reign of Athirajendra (1070-70). There are references to indicate that the Vakra Kali temple is existing from Pallava times. In modern times, the temple is administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Architecture Chandramowleeswarar temple is located in Thiruvakkarai, a village located on the banks of Varaha river, located from Villupuram. The temple in its current structure built of stone was built by the Chola king Aditya I (870 - 907 CE). The temple has a seven-tiered Rajagopuram, the gateway tower that pierces the rectangular wall that houses all the shrines. The temple tank is located adjacent to the temple. The sanctum sanctorum houses the one of the rare image of Chandramowleeswarar in the form of Lingam, an iconic form of Shiva with three faces, said to be of the very few in India. There is an Ardha Mandapa and a Mukha mandapa, pillared halls leading to the sanctum. The first precinct has the shrines of Vinayakar, Murugan, Durga, Dakshinamurthy and Chandikeswara. The second precinct has a hundred pillared hall. Architecturally there are many things in this temple that are contrary to tradition. Generally, one can have the darshan of the main deity from the entrance itself, however, in this temple the main deity is not visible as the Moolavar is not in a straight line. In fact, none of main features of the temple‚Äîthe Rajagopuram, flag post, Nandhi‚Äîare on a straight line and are found slightly away from one another. Also, unlike other temples the Sani Bhagavan‚Äôs Vahanam, the crow is facing the left side as opposed to the normal right side. All these are attributed to the vakram nature (contradictory) of the temple. There is a separate shrine for Varadaraja Perumal Lord Vishnu and the idol has the unique feature of Prayoka Chakra, this cannot be seen elsewhere and the shrine for vakra Kali in the second precinct. Festival The temple follows Saivite tradition. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaivaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 8:30 a.m., Uchikalam at 11:30 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., and Sayarakshai between 8:00  8:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Chandramowleeswarar and Amirthambigai.There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6am - 12 pm and 4-8:30 pm. The Chitrapournami festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Panguni (April - May), float festival for Chandramouleeswarar during the Tamil month of Vaikasi and Kaanum Pongal festival during the Tamil month of Thai are the most prominent festivals celebrated in the temple. There are other common festivals like Shivaratri, Vinayaga Chaturthi, Vijayadasami and Karthigai Deepam celebrated in the temple. There is a wish tree in the compound having Naga, a snake representation. Childless ladies pray for the attaining child by placing or installing the stone symbols praying Vakrakali. Official Website Religious significance From the verses of Thirumangai Azhwar during the 8th-9th centuries on the temple of Thirunaraiyur indicate that there are seventy temples built by Kochengat Cholan during the Sangam period (3rd BCE to 3 CE). The Chandramowleeswarar temple is counted as one of the seventy Maadakovils built by Konchengannan. Tirugnana Sambandar, a 7th-century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Chandramowleeswarar in ten verses in Tevaram, compiled as the First Tirumurai. Appar, a contemporary of Sambandar, also venerated Chandramowleeswarar in 10 verses in Tevaram, compiled as the Fifth Tirumurai. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 275 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon.

Any signal which is varying conveys valuable information. Hence to understand the information embedded in such signals, we need to 'detect' and 'extract data' from such quantities. Geophysical signals are of extreme importance to us as they are information bearing signals which carry data related to petroleum deposits beneath the surface and seismic data. Analysis of geophysical signals also offers us a qualitative insight into the possibility of occurrence of a natural calamity such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. Gravitational and magnetic fields are detected using extremely sensitive gravitometers and magnetometers respectively. The gravitational field changes are measured using devices such as atom interferometers. A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) is an extremely sensitive device which measures minute changes in the magnetic field. After detection, the data from these signals is extracted by performing spectral analysis, filtering and beamforming techniques. These techniques can be used in oil exploration to estimate the position of underground objects, harnessing geothermal energy.  Background  The position of underground objects can be determined by measuring the gradient in Earth's gravitational field. It is known that an object with heavier mass ‚Äúattracts‚Äù other objects of a considerably lower value of mass. This force of attraction is explained by understanding the following topics. Spatial and temporal frequency Temporal frequency is the number of occurrences of an event in unit \\"time\\". It is defined relative to time. Frequency of a wave can be X cycles per second. Spatial frequency on the other hand is the characteristic of any entity that periodically varies in space. =Digitizing in time and space domain= Digitizing of any signal has two aspects : \\"digitizing in time domain\\" and \\"digitizing in space domain\\". These concepts pertain to the signals varying in space, time or both. * Time domain digitization is the process of measuring the amplitude of signal in discrete time intervals. *Space domain digitization is the process of measuring the amplitude of signal in discrete spatial domain. Ex: Measuring intensity of electromagnetic field at various spatial intervals. =Tensor= To explain the concept of a tensor, consider the definition of a vector: ‚ÄúVector is a quantity having both magnitude and direction. Vectors are tensors with rank 1‚Äù. There is only basis vector for a component. Ex: Velocity is represented as Ai + Bj + Ck where i,j,k are unit vectors in the x,y,z directions respectively. We can see that there is a one- one mapping between the basis vector and its component. right Tensor, on the other hand has rank greater than one. Gravitational field is an example for a tensor. This figure describes the i component of Area vector and the i,j,k components of gravitational filed vector. 3-d gravitational field vector components acting on the 'j' component of area vector. 3-d gravitational field vector components acting on the 'k' component of area vector The set of figures on the left represent the various components of the gravitational field. These components fully characterize all the forces acting on a body. These can be represented in a matrix form as follows: Representation of all the components of the gravitational gradient vector Now that we are familiar with the concepts of gravity and tensors, a qualitative discussion of gravity and its significance in geophysical analysis can be done. A certain mass distribution creates a gravitational force field around it, In other words, the object under consideration has a finite mass ‚ÄòM‚Äô and hence bends the space around it. The gravitational field gradient is given by the divergence of the gravitational field.  Existing approaches in geophysical signal recognition and analysis = Estimating the positions of the underground objects by measuring gravitational measurements  The method being discussed here assumes that the mass distribution of the underground objects of interest is already known and hence the problem of estimating their location boils down to parametric localisation. Since the mass distribution of objects of interest is already known, say underground objects with center of masses (CM1, CM2...CMn) are located under the earth and at positions p1, p2...pn. The gravity gradient (components of the gravity field) is measured using a spinning wheel with accelerometers also called as the gravity gradiometer.E.H. Metzger, ‚ÄúDevelopment Experience of Gravity Gradiometer System‚Äù, IEEE Plans Meeting,1982 The instrument is positioned in different orientations to measure the respective component of gravitational field. The values of gravitational gradient tensors are calculated and analyzed. The analysis includes observing the contribution of each object under consideration. A maximum likelihood procedure is followed and Cram√©r‚ÄìRao bound is computed to assess the quality of location estimate.  Measurement of Earth‚Äôs magnetic fields  Magnetometers are used to measure the magnetic fields, magnetic anomalies in the earth. The sensitivity of magnetometers depends upon the requirement. Ex, the variations in the geomagnetic fields can be to the order of several aT where 1aT = 10^-18T . In such cases, specialized magnetometers such as a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) are used. Jim Zimmerman co-developed the superconducting quantum interference device during his tenure at Ford research lab. However, events leading to the invention of squid were in fact, serendipitous. John Lambe, during his experiments on nuclear magnetic resonance noticed that the electrical properties of indium varied due to a change in the magnetic field of the order of few nT. But, Lambe was not able to fully recognise the utility of SQUID. SQUIDs have the capability to detect magnetic fields of extremely low magnitude. This is due to the virtue of Josephson junctions. Jim Zimmerman pioneered the development of SQUID by proposing a new approach to making the Josephson junctions. He made use of niobium wires and niobium ribbons to form two Josephson junctions connected in parallel. The ribbons act as the interruptions to the superconducting current flowing through the wires. The junctions are very sensitive to the magnetic fields and hence are very useful in measuring fields of the order of 10‚àí18 T.  Measurement of seismic waves  Background = The motion of any mass is affected by the gravitational field. The motion of planets is affected by the Sun's enormous gravitational field. Likewise, a heavier object will influence the motion of other objects of smaller mass in its vicinity. However, this change in the motion is very small compared to the motion of heavenly bodies. Hence, special instruments are required to measure such a minute change. =Atom interferometer= Describes the atom interferometer principle Atom interferometers work on the principle of diffraction. The diffraction gratings are nano fabricated materials with a separation of a quarter wavelength of light. When a beam of atoms pass through a diffraction grating, due to the inherent wave nature of atoms, they split and form interference fringes on the screen. An atom interferometer is very sensitive to the changes in the positions of atoms. As heavier objects shifts the position of the atoms nearby, displacement of the atoms can be measured by detecting a shift in the interference fringes.  Analysis of geophysical signals  Any signal conveys information in two ways : * Temporal and spatial variation of the data * Frequency variation of the data. = Spectral analysis  Fourier representation  The Fourier expansion of a time domain signal is the representation of the signal as a sum of its frequency components, specifically sum of sines and cosines. Joseph Fourier came up with the Fourier representation to estimate the heat distribution of a body. The same approach can be followed to analyse the multi-dimensional signals such as electromagnetic waves. The 4d - Fourier representation of such signals is given by: S(K, œâ) = ‚à´ ‚à´ s(x,t) exp [-j(œât- k'x)] dx dt * œâ represents temporal frequency and k represents spatial frequency. * s(x,t) is a 4-dimensional space time signal which can be imagined as travelling plane waves. The plane of propagation is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of an electromagnetic wave.  Filtering  Simply put, space time signal filtering problem can be thought as localizing the speed and direction of a particular signal.Dan E. Dudgeon, Russell M. Mersereau, ‚ÄúMultidimensional Digital Signal Processing‚Äù, Prentice-Hall Signal Processing Series, ,pp. 291-294, 1983. The design of filters for spacetime signals follows a similar approach as that of 1-D signals. The filters for 1-D signals are designed in such a way that if the requirement of the filter is to extract frequency components in a particular non-zero range of frequencies, a band- pass filter with appropriate passband and stop band frequencies in determined. Similarly, in the case of multi-dimensional systems, the wavenumber-frequency response of filters is designed in such a way that it is unity in the designed region of (k, œâ) a.k.a. wavenumber - frequency and zero elsewhere. =Beamforming= This approach is applied for filtering spacetime signals. It is designed to isolate signals travelling in a particular direction. One of the simplest filters is weighted delay and sum beamformer. The output is the average of the linear combination of delayed signals. In other words, the beamformer output is formed by averaging weighted and delayed versions of receiver signals. The delay is chosen such that the passband of beamformer is directed to a specific direction in the space. Spatial distribution of phased arrays to filter geophysical signals =Upward continuation in analyzing magnetic fields= This method can be used to estimate the depth of the magnetic materials beneath the earth. The magnetic data is processed by the spectral methods such as Fourier transforms. The FFT algorithm makes the spectral analysis of signals fast, easy and efficient. The FFT computations can be performed in the machines which allow us to perform contour mapping. The upward continuation method attenuates the wave number anomalies associated with the shallow magnetic sources. Thus the signal components contain the information about the objects situated deep beneath the earth. Applications= Geothermal energy mapping The gravity data is collected from a detailed geographical surveys. The gravitational field intensity is measured using the gravimeter. Also, the elevations have to measured to account for the height corrections. The Bouguer anomalies in the gravity data are analysed. The Bouguer anomaly is a correction of the gravitational data which takes into account the heights of different terrains. The Bouguer data is coupled with other magnetic and seismic measurements of the region. This data is instrumental in revealing the tectonic and structural geography that area. After the data is obtained, some of the observations from the Bouguer data indicate the following: * The Bouguer anomaly data is directly related to the subsurface topology of the region. * The positive Bouguer anomalies indicate igneous intrusions in the sub-surface. * The gravity studies also indicate the presence of sub-surface aquifers. Hence, it can be guessed that the water circulation in the region of igneous intrusions can be a source of geothermal energy.  Oil exploration The process of oil exploration] starts with finding a layer of impermeable substance under which oil is buried. Until a well is drilled, one can't accurately determine the presence of oil. However, by the efficient use of geothermal techniques, we can detect a layer beneath which oil may be trapped. There are several approaches to detect the \\"oil traps\\" * The presence of flowing oil can cause minute changes in the gravitational and magnetic fields of the earth. These small changes in gravitational and magnetic fields can be picked up by sensitive gravimeters and magnetometers respectively. * In another approach, shock waves are sent beneath the surface. As the waves travel through the earth, they are reflected by various rock layers. The sensors mounted at the surface measure the time of arrival of the reflected waves. The presence/absence of oil can be ascertained by analyzing these readings. Seismic reflection techniques can provide reasonable accurate information over a larger area.

It was bred by Wilford Mills of Pennsylvania State University in collaboration with the Wise Potato Chip Company. The Lenape potato was produced by crossing Delta Gold with a wild Peruvian potato (Solanum chacoense) known for its resistance to insects. It was selected for its high specific gravity (percentage dry matter) and low sugar content which made it ideal for producing potato chips but it was also immune to potato virus A and resistant to common strains of late blight. It is of medium-late maturity and produces round, white tubers with shallow eyes. Glycoalkaloid content After the Lenape variety was released for commercial production, a potato breeder in Ontario ate some to see if they might be suitable as new potatoes but soon felt nauseated. When the same occurred next time he ate them, he sent a sample to be analysed by a vegetable biochemist, Dr. Ambrose Zitnak of the University of Guelph, who found they contained exceptionally high levels of glycoalkaloids (mainly solanine and chaconine), the natural toxins found in potatoes that help protect them from pests and disease. Lenape potatoes collected from around Canada were found to contain over 16‚Äì35 mg of glycoalkaloids per 100 g of fresh potato compared to 3‚Äì18 mg in other varieties. Samples grown at 39 locations around the US had an average of 29 mg per 100 g of potato but ranged from 16‚Äì65 mg compared to an average of 8 mg for five other varieties. Previously, high levels of glycoalkaloids in potatoes were associated with damage during harvest or potatoes that turned green due to exposure to light, rather than being genetically determined. The variety was removed from the market in 1970 and scientists recommended that in future new potato varieties be tested for their glycoalkaloid content before widespread distribution. Unintended risks The variety has been cited as an example of how conventional plant breeding can produce varieties with high levels of toxins and this has been compared with the relatively lower risk of potential unintended health effects from genetically engineered crops (GM crops). In 1992 the Los Angeles Times reported that critics of GM crops cited it as an example of the problems they expected GM crops to create, despite the Lenape being a conventionally bred variety and not GM, while advocates noted that lessons learned from Lenape meant that regulations were in place to prevent a recurrence. In the case of the Lenape potato, the exceptionally high glycoalkaloid levels were likely due to the unintended introduction (through cross breeding) of new glycoalkaloid genes from the wild Peruvian parent. Genetic engineering avoids the risk of unintended introduction of new genes, as only selected genes that have been characterized in detail are introduced. Use in breeding Lenape was kept for use in breeding and breeders selected for progeny containing high dry matter but rejected those with high glycoalkaloids. Lenape is a parent of chipping varieties including Atlantic, Trent, Belchip and Snowden and a grandparent of several others. A study published in 1998 found that Lenape had the highest dry matter content of chipping varieties released in the USA and concluded that the release of Lenape marked a \\"major advance in chipping quality\\" and was particularly responsible for a trend of increased dry matter content in newer varieties.

History  The group was founded in 1981 in Germany, initially as a protest action in response to the under- representation of women in Berlin's Internationale Bauaustellung (International Building Exhibition or IBA, 1979-1987). After initially \\"hijacking\\" official IBA meetings, the group formally established itself a short time later in Berlin, and later expanded to other German cities, developing a strong and influential voice for gender equality, in particular throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Independent regional chapters were established in Dortmund (1985), Hamburg, Bremen, Kassel (1983) and Rhein-Main (Frankfurt). An 11-point charter, titled \\"Principles for a new spatial order\\" () and advocating an aspirational planning and development approach based on equal civil, political, economic, cultural and social rights for men and women, was produced as a result of the 1991 European Women Planners Conference in Berlin. The Berlin Charter was published in a special edition of the group's yearly magazine Freie.R√§ume a short time later. Active members over time have included Veronika Keckstein, , Ellen Nausester, and .  Aims and activities  FOPA's goals include: to develop and promote feminist positions in architecture, planning and environmental and construction industry politics; to address gender discrimination against women in the field; to increase women's involvement in planning and development, under the broader aim to change the spatial-built environment for the interests of women and the women's movement. Between 1983 and 2004, FOPA published the magazine FREI.R√ÑUME (free spaces) on the subject of feminist theory and practice in the planning, design, architecture and building. The magazine title (Frei.R√§ume Streitschrift) is itself a play on words that reflects the creators' agenda: merging the German words \\"Streiten\\", meaning \\"to fight\\", and \\"Zeitschrift\\", magazine. The group has also held numerous exhibitions, conferences and seminars.

As a result, three female architects, Zaha M. Hadid, Christine Jachmann und Myra Warhaftig, were commissioned to design three of six social housing complexes.

History Visceral Disgorge originally formed in early 2007, coming from the remains of a former death metal band known as Eaten Alive. Wanting to go in a heavier direction than their previous band, Travis Werner and Eric Vieraitis began forming the foundation of what would later be known as Visceral Disgorge. In late 2009, Visceral Disgorge recorded a single demo track which received the attention that resulted in the signing of a record deal with Japanese death metal label Amputated Vein Records. Soon after, they prepared for the worldwide release in 2011 of their debut album Ingesting Putridity, which showcased the graphic illustrations of Japanese artist Toshihiro Egawa for the album artwork. The album received positive feedback from several sources. Shortly following the release of Ingesting Putridity, Visceral Disgorge began making appearances at metal festivals throughout the United States and abroad. These festivals included Maryland Deathfest(IX,XIV), Netherlands Deathfest, Frankfurt Deathfest, Las Vegas Deathfest IV, Puerto Rico Metal Demolition Fest, New York Deathfest, New Jersey Deathfest, Philadelphia Infest, Delaware Deathfest, Brutality reigns fest, Louisvillie Death Fest, and DeLand Metal Fest among other festivals. In 2014, guitarist Steve Rosenzweig died forcing the band to find the replacement Charlie Marvel. The band released a memorial music video in his memory for their song \\"Necrocoprophagia\\". Sound The band performs a style of brutal death metal which utilizes frequent slam riffs and guttural growl vocals. They use down tuned guitars often incorporating fast and complex guitar riffing as well as slam riffs and breakdowns, alongside an onslaught of blast beats and double bass drumming, as well as a sophisticated and technical sense of song writing. The band's lyrics and imagery primarily focus on gratuitous graphic violence which is highly influenced by various works of horror fiction, science fiction, and horror films. They are often considered as highly controversial and are notable within the death metal genre.

In retrospect Gippius' debut book of poetry has been regarded as the major event in Russian cultural and literary life. \\"Gippius the poet holds her special place in the Russian literature; her poems are deeply intellectual, immaculate in form and genuinely exciting,\\" the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary wrote in the early 1910s. Critics praised her originality, virtuosity of a wordsmith and called her the \\"true heir of Baratynsky's muse\\". Upon its release, though, The Collection of Poems. 1889‚Äì1903 was unanimously praised only by a small group of art and literary critics belonging to the Modernist group (held derogatively as 'decadents' by detractors) and almost unanimously panned by those belonging to the 'traditionalist' camp. The latter, who were in the majority (and for a rare occasion united critics from all sides of the political specter, including the left radicals and the right- wing conservatives), attacked both Gippius and the 'new Art' in general. The Marxist critic and philosopher Vladimir Shulyatikov described The Collected Poems. 1889‚Äì1903 as the 'artistic failure' of the author who's found herself \\"confused by the life process.\\"Courier, December 1, 1903 // –ö—É—Ä—å–µ—Ä. 1903.

For the poet Innokenty Annensky the book represented the peak of Russia‚Äôs fifteen years of Symbolism Equally rapturous was the poet and critic (later, a well-known chess player and historian of literature) who marveled at the way the poet \\"cast light upon our darkest and most uneasy passions,\\" and \\"unveiled the mysteries of reality, transforming them into revelations.\\" This \\"religious contemplation (for want of a better word) fills almost the whole book and is expressed the best where there is not a word about God,\\" he noted. Comparing the book with to the works contemporary impressionists poetry, Smirnov remarked: \\"Z.

Poet and critic Nikolai Poyarkov used the debut Collection of Poems as an occasion for tracing down Gippius' development ('from sticky atheism to Christianity', as he put it) and found her earlier 'decadent' pieces artistically more interesting than her later religious poems. \\"The God-searching poems are cold, dry and un-prayer-like. Logical and schematic, they lack the true sinner's yell, this passion of the one at crossroads, longing for God.

It is on a rural gravel road west of the village of Westmill. It has been listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England since February 1967. Button Snap cottage, located about northwest of Cherry Green Farm and Fancy Hall, is significant for several reasons. First, it has changed little, excepting for a possible later extension, since it was built. It is therefore a good example of a traditional cottage with a roof of thatched straw. The heritage listing for Button Snap describes its construction as \\"Timber frame roughcast on plastered red brick sill\\". A number of other thatched-roof cottages, known as Cherry Green, exist nearby. This cottage has a unique history. It was originally owned by Francis Field, the uncle of the writer Charles Lamb. In 1812 Field's widow conveyed this property to Lamb, who lived in the cottage until 1815, when he sold it. Lamb mentioned this house in an essay, \\"My First Play.\\"Waymarking.com website, at http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM9MP0_Button_Snap_Cottage_Westmill_Herts_UK . Lamb even apparently gave the cottage its name of Button Snap.Hertfordshire Genealogy website, at http://www.hertfordshire- genealogy.co.uk/data/places/places-w/westmill_/westmill-button-snap.htm . The cottage has two ceramic plaques on either side of the front door that tell of its connection to Lamb. A small bust of Lamb is next to the road (at the verge) in front of the cottage, as well.Waymaking.com website. This cottage was privately owned for many years. In 1947 the owner presented Button Snap to the Royal Arts Society. Two years later the Society sold the property to the Charles Lamb Society, which leased it to tenants. Because of rising costs of maintaining the structure, it was sold in 1985.Deborah K.

It consisted of a constitution coupled with a settlement and development plan for the colony. The former was titled the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina. The word \\"constitutions\\" (in the plural) was synonymous with \\"articles.\\" The document was composed of 120 constitutions, or articles. The settlement and development plan for the colony consisted of several documents, or \\"instructions,\\" for guiding town and regional planning as well as economic development. Both the Fundamental Constitutions and the development plan were drafted by the English liberal philosopher John Locke while working for the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, the eight noblemen who held the royal charter to settle the colony. Locke was also a personal assistant to Anthony Ashley Cooper, the Proprietor who became the Earl of Shaftesbury soon after the principal elements of the Grand Model were drafted. Ashley Cooper is considered the founder of Carolina, thus the Grand Model may also be called the Ashley Cooper Plan.Famous plans are often named after the person who conceived them, e.g., the Oglethorpe Plan, the L'Enfant Plan Today the term Grand Model is used more restrictively in Charleston, South Carolina to refer to the original planned area of the city.Steedman, \\"How the City Grew\\".  Vision  Anthony Ashley Cooper oversaw Locke's drafting of the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina during the first decade of the Restoration, a time when the failure of the Commonwealth of England was fresh in mind. During the Commonwealth period he had served in the government of Oliver Cromwell and participated in reviewing English laws and drafting the nation's first formal constitution. Before that, English constitutional law was based on ancient constitutional documents such as the Magna Carta. The experience led Ashley Cooper to see value in adopting a formal constitution for the Province of Carolina.For a contemporary perspective on Ashley Cooper's career, see, Spurr, John, Chapter 1; Marshall, Alan, Chapter 2; and Leng, Thomas, Chapter 5 in Spurr, Anthony Ashley Cooper, First Earl of Shaftesbury, 1621‚Äì1683. For a complete and authoritative biography, see, Haley, The First Earl of Shaftesbury. Although Ashley Cooper aided the restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660, for which service he and the other Lords Proprietors were granted the charter for Carolina, he strongly believed in the English tradition of common law and balanced government (a system sometimes called the \\"Ancient Constitution\\" wherein the nobility played an essential role. The Fundamental Constitutions was designed to formalize a \\"Gothic\\" system of balanced government in the new province. Although described as feudalism by some authorities, the system was arguably more advanced by virtue of its constitution and emphasis on basic rights and reciprocal benefits among classes. It was nevertheless a pre-Enlightenment system predicated on class hierarchy.See Pocock, p. 94, for use of the word \\"gothic\\"  Settlement and development plan  The Fundamental Constitutions provided a framework for urban and regional development consistent with and supportive of the plan for governance and economic development. Once settlement began in 1670 a series of \\"instructions\\" were transmitted to the colonists with details that fleshed out areas that were not addressed by the Fundamental Constitutions.Shaftesbury, 322, 367, 405. The design of towns in Carolina was influenced by the intensive planning that went on in London after the Great Fire of 1666. The government of Charles II solicited plans to rebuild the city, and inspired designs were submitted by architect Christopher Wren, scientist Robert Hooke, cartographer Richard Newcourt, and landscape planner and polymath John Evelyn. Their designs influenced city planning in the areas of public health and safety, land use efficiency, and urban aesthetics.Wilson, 100-103.For background on Hooke's role, see Cooper, Michael, A More Beautiful City: Robert Hooke and the Rebuilding of London after the Great Fire.  Role of John Locke  John Locke (1697). Portrait by Godfrey Kneller. Locke first became involved with Carolina as a personal assistant to Anthony Ashley Cooper, a relationship that began in 1666. Soon afterward he became secretary to the Lords Proprietors and began drafting the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina and associated planning materials. The precise extent to which Locke shaped the substance of the Fundamental Constitutions is unknown, but he was undoubtedly guided at least on a general level by Ashley Cooper.Wilson, 44-48. Locke's position with the Lords Proprietors might be described as that of \\"chief planner\\" for Carolina. He drafted development standards for towns as well as an illustrative plan that he included in his instructions to the colonists. His urban plan provided detailed standards for block size, lot size, street width, waterfront setbacks, and other standards similar to modern planning and zoning ordinances.Wilson, 44-48. Locke also wrote guiding principles for regional development that were remarkably similar to principles of modern planning, including aspects of sustainable development and smart growth. Such aspects include, a) consistency of development practices with the general plan (Fundamental Constitutions); b) concurrent provision of infrastructure with land development; and compactness of development to promote efficient use of land and access to markets.Wilson, 44-48. Slavery and the Grand Model Locke famously denounced slavery in the first sentence of his Two Treatises of Government, then proceeded to develop the new idea of natural equality. Since the Grand Model anticipated slavery, Locke has been labeled a hypocrite by some scholars for designing Carolina and then continuing to be associated with the venture after writing the famous indictment of slavery. While the Fundamental Constitutions contains an article establishing slavery, one can find no references to slavery in the detailed planning documents over which Locke had the most control. Thus while Locke and Ashley Cooper anticipated that Carolina would have slaves, as did most other colonies, it is unlikely that they anticipated that it would become fundamentally dependent on slavery (i.e., a \\"slave society\\") as later happened. On the other hand, it must be admitted that Locke did have a certain financial interest in the institution of slavery. He invested in the notorious Royal African Company (chartered in 1660 under King Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland),W. M. Spellman, John Locke, p. 15 which is said to have shipped tens of thousands of slaves from West Africa to the British colonies in North America. The Grand Model allocated more land (60 percent) and representation to \\"the people\\" than to the nobility, suggesting that yeoman farmers were envisioned ultimately to become the backbone of the colony. Nevertheless, a slave-owning elite was also part of the formula from the beginning. Where Ashley Cooper saw slavery as playing a vital role was in the establishment of the principal estates. In December, 1671, he advised against bringing too many of \\"the poorer sort\\" to the colony until \\"men of estates\\" could first \\"stock the country with Negroes, cattle, and other necessarys.\\" Shaftesbury Papers, 364 The transformation of Carolina from a colony with slaves to a slave colony, and later a slave society, began when slaveowners from Barbados became the dominant force in Carolina politics during the 1780s. Barbados had evolved into a slave colony with a majority slave population during that period. The Grand Model was informally modified by the Barbadians, who took the titles of nobility, but replaced Ashley Cooper's enlightened aristocracy with a self-serving oligarchy. The new plantation elite exercised little regard for balanced government, class reciprocity, or humane treatment of the servant and slave classes.Wilson, Chapter 3 The Grand Model and America's planning tradition The following components of the Grand Model influenced subsequent colonial town planning.:Home, Of Planting and Planning, 9. 1\\\\. Regular settlement rather than scattered pattern of development 2\\\\. Town, suburban, and country lot allocation 3\\\\. Town planned and laid out in advance 4\\\\. Wide streets laid out in geometric form usually within a square mile grid 5\\\\. Public squares 6\\\\. Standardized, rectangular lots 7\\\\. Reserved lots for civic purposes 8\\\\. Separation of town and country with a common or greenbelt Philadelphia and Savannah were among the American cities adopting these components of the Grand Model.Home, Of Planting and Planning, 8. The Georgia Trustees acknowledged the influence of the Grand Model: \\"We are indebted to the Lord Shaftsbury, and that truly wise man Mr. Locke,\\" they wrote, \\"for the excellent laws which they drew up for the first settlement of Carolina.\\"Martyn, \\"Reasons for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America,\\" 1732. While Locke's plan for Charles Town (Charleston, SC) and other cities of Carolina was only partially implemented, its grid, civic spaces, and wide streets became common features of American city planning, due in large part to the examples of Philadelphia and Savannah (see Oglethorpe Plan). Influence on American political culture The Grand Model influenced the formation of southern, traditionalistic political culture. The model, modified by slaveowners from the Caribbean, created a formal slave society that became a model for the future states of the Deep South. The Grand Model contributed a stable plantation land use pattern and a formal social hierarchy led by nobility. The Barbadian slaveowners added large scale monoculture (sugar cane in Barbados, rice in Carolina) and a more rigid system of government and social control by a slaveowning elite. The blended system in Carolina established a pattern that was followed throughout the eighteenth century, and ultimately proved well- suited to King Cotton.Wilson, Chapter 4.

Early computers were limited in processing speed and storage capacity. If a software like CC-DOS or :zh:UCDOS is being used to render Chinese characters, the Chinese font could take up to 1/3 of RAM, making it impossible to execute large programs. Moreover, Chinese rendering via software must go through the BIOS, so that the speed is as slow as dozens of characters per second. Using a Chinese Character card could improve the computer's ability to process Chinese text. The card has a Chinese font burnt on its ROM chip, so that the font no longer takes up computer RAM. It takes internal codes and directly renders the corresponding characters onto the screen, which works much faster than software-based rendering. Manufacturers At the beginning of the 1990s, Lenovo, Founder Group, and Giant Corporation were manufacturing Chinese Character cards. Decline As computer hardware improved, Chinese character cards were gradually rendered obsolete by software. Currently very few computers use Chinese Character cards to handle Chinese text.

By the fourth century, a portrait of a couple on a sarcophagus from the empire did not necessarily signify the burial of two spouses but instead demonstrated the importance of the material bond.

The wife and husband were probably former slaves because Slavery in ancient Rome was common. It has been estimated that Italy alone had about two million slaves. Some slaves gained freedom in return for their service, while other died as slaves in service of their original or new owner. As slaves, couples had no legal standing, after they had been freed former slaves became people in the eye of the law. Therefore, freedmen and freedwomen would portray themselves as married couple on their tombs.Kleiner, S, Fred. A History of Roman Art: Clark Baxter, 2007. Print.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Description and history The Guilford Country Store is set on the east side of the junction of Coolidge Highway and Guilford Center Road, in the center of Guilford's main village. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, clapboard siding, and a foundation that is mainly stone. It is set close to the road, with its main facade facing west toward the road. The front is a symmetrical five bays wide, and the former main entrance has simple Federal period styling, with sidelight windows and a simple cornice. A gable-roofed ell extends to the rear, and a shed-roof ell extends across the northern facade, with a gable above the current main entrance. Its upstairs ballroom has been partially converted into residential space. Broad Brook House was built in 1817 by Solomon Pratt, one of East Guilford's earliest landowners and businessmen. He built the tavern at this point on what was then the major north-south route (now US 5) through the area. Since then, the building has served a variety of important roles in the community, including as a meeting space, Masonic lodge, post office, inn, and barber shop. In 1936 George Fisher purchased the building, and moved the Morse general store, then located across the street, into it.

He was a recipient of the 2003 Jamnalal Bajaj Award. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian award of the Padma Shri, in 2000, for his services to the society.  Biography  Upadhyay was born in a small village in Ballia District of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh in 1923 and did his college studies at Banaras Hindu University. Attracted by the ideals of Subash Chandra Bose, he joined the Indian independence movement during his school days and is said to have been involved in armed struggle but, after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948, he abandoned violent politics to pursue non violence. Associating himself with Vinoba Bhave and his Bhoodan Movement, he joined Shram Bharati, a Gandhian community, in 1951, to work alongside renowned Gandhians such as Jayaprakash Narayan, Dhirendra Majumdar and Acharya Ramamurti. When the Sino-Indian War broke out in 1962, he moved to the Assam border and worked there as a Shanti Sainik. In Assam, he chose Tamulpur village, on advice from Amalprava Das, the head of local Shanti Sena, and founded the Tamulpur Anchalik Gramdan Sangha (TAGS), a non governmental organization in Tamulpur village for spreading the Gramodyog (Village industry) ideals, under the aegis of which he promoted cottage industries such as silk, khadi, honey and oil. The organization has since become a Khadi Gramodyog Training Center. He also founded a Peace Centre, at Kumarikata village in the Nalbari District. Under the aegis of these organizations, he established a common granary to act as a food depository for use in times of need and arranged for financial assistance to free up land from the local land owners. Establishment of Creches, low cost sanitation, biogas plants and drinking water facilities were some of the other contributions of Upadhyay in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. He was also involved with relief operations when famine affected the area. Aligning with Khadi and Village Industries Commission, Upadhyay started New Weavers' Training Centre for training villagers in cottage industries and set up buildings, work-sheds, hostels and equipment such as oil presses and bee-boxes for the farmers and artisans. When the Union Government decided to evict all refugees migrated from the erstwhile East Pakistan and settled in Tamulpur, he protested and declared a peaceful satyagraha which persuaded the government to revoke the decision. His opposition to the secessionist activities of Bodo people exposed him to physical assault by the militants. During the Emergency period, he also suffered incarceration for protesting against the government. Upadhyay was married to Shakuntala Devi, who was also involved in his social activities. He died on 12 April 2010, at Guwahati, at the age of 87.  Awards and honours  The Government of India included him in the 2000 Republic Day honours list for the civilian award of the Padma Shri for his services to the society. In 2003, he was awarded the Jamnalal Bajaj Award for constructive work by Jamnalal Bajaj Foundation.

Early life  Trude Herr was born in the Cologne district of Kalk, grew up in the city's district of M√ºlheim and attended school there. Her father Robert Herr was a locomotive driver and was imprisoned for a long time because of his membership in the Communist Party; later he was sent to a concentration camp. For him she wrote the song \\"Papa\\", in which she thanked her father for her time; she sang it in 1961 at his funeral. She herself was a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. In 1933, she attended primary school in Cologne-M√ºlheim after which she worked in a bakery. Since the apartment of the Herrs was destroyed by bombs in 1943, they lived two years in the community of Ewersbach in Hesse. There she worked as a typist in the Dillenburg city administration, where she was known by her nicknames of \\"Tutti\\" and jokingly also as \\"dat Pummel\\" because of her full figure. In 1946, she became an extra at the Aachener Wanderb√ºhne, and from 1948 she received supporting roles at the Cologne Millowitsch Theater.  Career  In the Millowitsch theater, she played her first major role in the recorded for television 1955 comedy The Sold Grandfather alongside Willy Millowitsch, Elsa Scholten, Franz Schneider and others. In 1949, she and her friend and mentor Gustav Schellhardt founded the \\"Cologne Lustspielb√ºhne\\", whose existence, however, was not long lasting. Throughout her life, she was proud of this project and mentioned it repeatedly in press interviews. After its bankruptcy, Trude Herr worked between 1949 and 1954 as a barmaid in the gay bar Barberina (Hohes Tor). From 1954 onwards, she performed at the carnival time again and again at the events of various clubs in Cologne as B√ºttenrednerin (carnival comedy speaker) and always earned great applause. In her performances, she followed the style of the well-known 1920s variety and revue singer Grete River. Trude Herr was discovered by Willi Schaeffers, the head of the cabaret Tingel-Tangel, who engaged her in Berlin in 1958. With the German version of Percolator under the title \\"Ich will keine Schokolade (ich will lieber einen Mann)\\" (English: I do not want chocolate (I'd prefer a man)) she reached No. 18 on the German hit charts. The song's German text was written by Carl-Ulrich Blecher. The song was performed by Herr in the German hit movie Marina (where she played \\"Trude Pippes\\"). The film premiered on 19 August 1960 and featured 15 hits, helping Herr to achieve her 1960 breakthrough. Afterwards, she appeared in more than 30 films, made numerous appearances on television programs and was successful in the German schlager genre. In August 1964, she took a five-month journey through the Saharan States, where in 1969 she met the Tunesian Tuareg Ahmed M'Barek. He accompanied her back to Germany, where they were married; the marriage lasted until 1976. With her own ensemble, she performed successfully in the Millowitsch Theater; from 16 September 1970 she delighted audiences in The Pearl Anna, and from 21 September 1972 in The P√ºtz Family. On 9 September 1977, she opened her folk theater Theater im Vringsveedel on Severinstra√üe. There she wanted to build a popular alternative to the established Millowitsch Theater. With plenty of Cologne humor and K√∂lsch sentimentality, garnished with a dose of vulgarity, she wrote and performed in pieces like Die K√∂lsche Geisha (1977), Der Hausmann and Massage Salon Denz (1979), Drei Glas K√∂lsch (1980), Scheidung Auf K√∂lsch (1981), Der Prophet (1985) and, as the last play, Der zweite Fr√ºhling (1986). Her stage partner at this time was Hans K√ºnster. The schedule lasted only from September to the end of December, the rest of the time the theater was rented out or was dark. Without municipal subsidies, which she vainly applied for in 1977 and 1982, the theater was financially constantly on weak feet. The very high visitor use rate of 97 percent did not change this either ‚Äì the fixed costs, including for 21 employees, were too high. Even though it was one of the best attended theaters in North Rhine- Westphalia, and also because of increasing health problems, she ended the theater experiment on 27 February 1986. In between theatrical productions, she worked in the WDR Fernsehen television production of Sch√∂ne Bescherung, which was broadcast in December 1983. Between October 1986 and January 1987, she recorded in the Info Studios in Monheim am Rhein with producer Thomas Br√ºck her album Ich sage was ich meine (\\"I say what I mean\\") with international hits featuring German lyrics. The melancholic song Niemals geht man so ganz (\\"You never leave completely\\"), which she interpreted with Wolfgang Niedecken (BAP) and Tommy Engel (Bl√§ck F√∂√∂ss) was her last great success; it reached in No. 20 in the German charts in August 1986.  Last years  After six serious operations on her neck and legs, she moved to Fiji in 1987 for health reasons and settled near the capital of Suva. In 1988, she received the Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. That same year, she appeared in her final TV interview with G√ºnther Jauch. Herr's grave at the K√∂lner Nordfriedhof cemetery. In January 1991, she returned with Samuel Bawesi, her partner, from Fiji to Cologne. In February 1991, she moved to Lauris, a small village in Vaucluse, Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur in southern France, where she died of heart failure on 16 March 1991. She was buried in the Cologne North Cemetery.

The film stars Nicholas Hoult, Henry Cavill, Logan Marshall-Green, Tommy Flanagan, Glen Powell, Beau Knapp, and Neil Brown Jr. The film centers on Matt Ocre, a young soldier in the United States Army, who is tasked with restoring water to a village in Iraq. It is based on the true events and the experience of the film's writer Roessner during the Iraq War. It was released on April 21, 2017 on Netflix.  Plot  At the beginning of the 2003 Iraq War, Pvt. Matt Ocre (Nicholas Hoult), a young civil affairs soldier with the Army Reserves slams his hand in the door of a Humvee in an attempt to get sent home. Narration reveals that he enlisted in July 2001, in order to get money for college. Some time later, he is seen with a cast on his arm, his attempt having been unsuccessful. His cast gets cut off just in time to be sent to Baghdad. During the battle, Ocre spots a sniper and Sergeant Dylan Chutsky (Glen Powell) calls in a helicopter strike that destroys the building the sniper is in. The film then skips forward to some time after the battle, when Ocre's squad is tasked with repairing a broken water system in the dangerous village of Baqubah. They arrive in the village and meet up with a Special Forces unit led by Cpt. Syverson (Henry Cavill). Syverson introduces them to their interpreter and explains that they are to travel to the pump station and fill a tanker with water to bring back to the village every day. At the station, the Army engineers working on the pump explain that it will take many weeks to finish repairs, but that the repairs would go much faster if Harper could recruit some of the villagers to help. Back at the village, they inform the locals that they will pay anyone who shows up to work the next morning. However, when the morning comes, there is no one there by the time they are ready to leave. With no labor forthcoming from the village, they are forced to help the engineers themselves. During one return trip, a vehicle is spotted coming up behind them at high speed. They stop the vehicle and interrogate the driver, but learn he is taking his young daughter to another village for medicine. During another trip, they are attacked by several insurgents with small arms, who shoot holes in the tank. The next day, while passing out water, gunfire breaks out. They engage in a pitched firefight with several enemy shooting from the rooftops, during which Sergeant Chutsky is killed. After finally getting help from Kadeer, the administrator of the local school (played by Navid Negahban), who desperately needs water to keep the school open, they begin making better progress on the station. One morning, none of the Iraqis show up to work and the squad returns to the village, where they find the administrator's body burned and tied to a stake in the schoolyard. The administrator's brother Arif (Nabil Elouahabi) angrily tells Syverson where the insurgents have been meeting. A plan is quickly formed to attack them that night. The attacks succeeds, killing several enemy and capturing more, but Cpl. Enzo (Neil Brown Jr.) and Sgt. Burton (Beau Knapp) are both injured and need to be evacuated by helicopter. Work on the pump station finally resumes, with Arif bringing in a crew of local workers. However, soon after, the pump station is hit by an Improvised explosive device brought by one of the workers in a suicide bombing, destroying all of the work done by the group and killing several Americans and Iraqis. Ocre and Harper return to their base in Baghdad. Harper is given three weeks leave, and Ocre is told he is going home. Ocre protests, but is overruled. Later that day, he is escorted to the airfield by Harper and Sgm. MacGregor (Tommy Flanagan). After asking MacGregor if it is a beautiful day for the infantry and receiving an enthusiastic affirmation, he boards the plane.

He was twice named German Horse of the Year and set an earnings record for a horse trained in Germany. He was one of the best juveniles in Germany in 1990, winning the Preis des Winterfavoriten and went on to greater success in 1993 when he won the Deutsches Derby and the Grosser Preis von Baden. He continued to improve as a four-year-old, winning the Hansa Preis and a second Grosser Preis von Baden in Germany as well as the Gran Premio del Jockey Club in Italy. He had his best year in 1995 when he won the Gran Premio di Milano and the Preis der Privatbankiers Merck, Finck & Co before ending his career with a victory in the Japan Cup. In all, he won 10 of his 23 races, having competed in five different countries on three continents. After his retirement from racing he became a successful breeding stallion. He died in 2013 at the age of 23. Background Lando was a \\"powerfully-built\\" bay horse standing 16.1 hands high bred in Germany by Gestut Hof Ittlingen. He was sired by Acatenango, a three-time German Horse of the Year whose other progeny include the Prix du Jockey Club winner Blue Canari and the Hong Kong Vase winner Borgia. His dam Laurea produced several other winners including the 1994 Deutsches Derby winner Laroche, and was a daughter of the German 1,000 Guineas winner Licata. During his racing career, Lando carried the colours of Gestut Haus Ittlingen and was trained by Heinz Jentzsch. Racing career=1992: two-year-old season Lando began his racing career by finishing second in a maiden race at Cologne on 22 August and then won the Junioren Preis at D√ºsseldorf a month later. On 18 October he contested Germany's most prestigious race for juveniles, the Preis des Winterfavoriten over 1600 metres at Cologne and won from Kornado and Henderson. 1993: three-year-old season Lando made little impact in his first three starts of 1993. He finished fifth in the Dr. Busch-Memorial, ninth in the Mehl-M√ºlhens-Rennen and seventh in the Union-Rennen, with all three races being won by Kornado. He faced Kornado yet again in the Deutsches Derby at Hamburg Racecourse on 4 July and started a 23.5/1 outsider. The 1993 Derby was the first running of the race which had been open to horses bred outside Germany and foreign bred- horses took eleven of the places in the nineteen-runner field. Ridden by Andreas Tylicki Lando won by one and a half lengths from Monsun, with the favoured Sternkoenig in third and Kornado unplaced. In the EuropaChampionat at Hoppegarten he was again beaten by Kornado when he finished second, with the British-trained colts River North and Beneficial in third and fourth and the Grand Prix de Paris winner Fort Wood in fifth. In September Lando was matched against older horses for the first time when he contested the Group One Grosser Preis von Baden over 2400 metres at Ifflezheim Racecourse. His opponents included Sapience (Jockey Club Stakes, Princess of Wales's Stakes) and Ruby Tiger (E. P. Taylor Stakes, Nassau Stakes) from England, George Augustus (Tattersalls Gold Cup) from Ireland and the 1992 German Horse of the Year Platini. Ridden again by Tylicki, Lando took the led 200 metres from the finish and won by a neck from Platini with a gap of six lengths back to George Augustus in third. 1994: four-year-old season Lando began his third season by finishing unplaced behind Kornado in the Grosser Preis der Wirtschaft on heavy ground before contesting the Group Two Hamsa Preis over 2200 metres at Hamburg on 26 June. Ridden by Peter Schiergen he took the lead 300 metres from the finish and won by half a length from Sternkoenig. Lando was beaten in his next two raced, taking fourth behind Sternkoenig in the Preis der Privatbankiers Merck, Finck & Co (now the Grosser Preis von Berlin) and then finishing fifth behind the British-trained River North in the Aral- Pokal. On 4 September 1994 Lando, with Schiergen in the saddle, attempted to repeat his 1993 success in the Grosser Preis von Baden. The Jentzch-trained Monsun headed the betting ahead of Kornado and Lando who were made joint- second-favourites at odds of 4.1/1. The other runners included the Lando's half-brother Laroche and the French challenger Vert Amande, winner of the Prix Ganay. After being restrained by Schiergen, Lando made progress in the straight, took the lead 200 metres out, and won by two lengths from Monsun with Kornado two and a half lengths back in third. Lando raced outside Germany for the first time when he was sent to France to contest the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Racecourse on 2 October. Ridden for the first time by the South African jockey Michael Roberts he finished eighth of the twenty runners, three lengths behind the winner Carnegie. The horses finishing behind Lando included King's Theatre, Celtic Arms and Intrepidity. Two weeks later, the colt appeared in Italy when he was one of seven horses to contest the Group One Gran Premio del Jockey Club at Milan. Roberts tracked the Jentzsch- trained pacemaker Embarcadero before sending Lando into the lead 500 metres from the finish. The German colt drew away from his opponents in the closing stages and won by six lengths from the French-trained Suave Tern. His performances in 1994 saw him voted German Horse of the Year. 1995: five- year-old season In 1995, as in 1994, Lando began his campaign with a defeat in the Grosser Preis der Wirtschaft, on this occasion taking third behind the French colt Freedom Cry and the British horse Alderbrook. Lando was accompanied by his pacemaker Embarcadero when he was sent to Italy for a second time to contest the Group One Gran Premio di Milano on 18 June. His main opposition appeared to come from the British challengers Broadway Flyer (Chester Vase, Gordon Stakes), Strategic Choice (John Porter Stakes) and Linney Head (Sandown Classic Trial). Embarcadero made the running before giving way to Broadway Flyer in the straight, but Roberts produced Lando to overtake the British colt 200 metres from the finish and won by two and a quarter lengths. In July, Lando returned to Germany for the Preis der Privatbankiers Merck, Finck & Co at D√ºsseldorf in July in which he was again opposed by Kornado and Laroche. Ridden by Schiergen, he turned into the straight in third before taking the lead and accelerating clear to win by two and a half lengths and three lengths from Laroche and Kornado. In September Lando started favourite in his attempt to win a third consecutive Grosser Preis von Baden but finished seventh behind the filly Germany. On 1 October Lando made his second bid for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and finished fourth of the sixteen runners behind Lammtarra, Freedom Cry and Swain. Four weeks later, Lando was sent to the United States for the twelfth running of the Breeders' Cup Turf at Belmont Park. He tracked the leaders but faded badly in the straight and finished twelfth of thirteen behind Northern Spur. On his final racecourse appearance, Lando contested the 15th running of the Japan Cup over 2400 metres in front of a record 180,760 crowd at Tokyo Racecourse on 26 November. The race featured six Japanese horses facing eight overseas challengers. The \\"home team\\" comprised Narita Brian, Nice Nature, Hishi Amazon (Hanshin Juvenile Fillies, Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup), Royce And Royce, Taiki Blizzard and Matikanetannhauser. The rest of the overseas contingent was made up of Sandpit and Awad from the United States, Hernando and Carling (Prix de Diane, Prix Vermeille) from France, Danewin (Rosehill Guineas, Mackinnon Stakes) and Stony Bay (Ranvet Stakes) from Australia and Pure Grain from England. Lando was restrained on the outside of the field by Roberts before turning into the straight in sixth place. He overtook the pace- setting Taiki Blizzard 200 metres from the finish and held of late challenges from Hishi Amazon and Hernando to win by one and a half lengths and a neck. Lando's victory in Japan took his earnings to ‚Ç¨2,892,802, a record for a horse trained in Germany. His achievements in 1995 saw him being voted German Horse of the Year for a second time. Stud record Lando was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at Gestut Hof Ittlingen and later stood in France at the France at Haras d'Etreham.

The line entered the national consciousness of the United States in the 1920s and 1930s and has often been referenced and parodied.Ethel Barrymore at TCM Origins According to entertainment columnist Sidney Skolsky in March 1931, the line comes from a play Barrymore starred in, Thomas Raceward's Sunday, which opened at New York's Hudson Theatre on November 15, 1904. Barrymore portrayed an eastern girl on a western ranch. During one scene, she read a letter from home, and her line upon finishing a reading of the letter was \\"That's all there is‚Äîthere isn't any more.\\"The Big Apple: \\"That's all there is‚Äîthere isn't any more!\\" (Broadway curtain-call speech) Barrymore would use the line after the play to quiet the thunderous applause beckoning her to do a curtain call. The phrase, which typified Ethel's blunt humor and distaste for attention, became a part of the national language. Ethel herself would parody it in a 1949 Christmas broadcast on Bing Crosby's radio show, though she couldn't finish the line reading without erupting into laughter. Ethel Barrymore's last words were reportedly \\"Is everybody happy? I know I'm happy. That's all there is, there isn't any more.\\" References in popular culture The phrase has been parodied and referenced frequently.Search Results on the Google News Archive for \\"That's all there is, there isn't any more\\" In theatre it was most famously quoted in George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber's The Royal Family, a comedy satirizing the Barrymore family. Examples of film references include the 1933 pre-code Sons of the Desert, where it is quoted by Oliver Hardy. In literature it was the closing line for every book in the children's series Madeline, and it would become the franchise's most famous phrase. References in music include Nat King Cole's \\"That's All There Is to That\\"That's All There Is Lyrics and Judy Garland's \\"That's All There Is, There Isn't Any More\\". Bruce Springsteen was also known to say variations of the lines during his lengthy, concert-ending performances of Gary U.S. Bonds's song \\"Quarter to Three\\" on the Darkness Tour in 1978. In 2005's King Kong, Naomi Watts's character Ann Darrow uses the phrase when she becomes exhausted from Kong's insistence that she continue performing vaudeville tricks to entertain him. Most recently, in a 2017 videogame Cuphead (which stylistically emulates the 1930s cartoons and generally maintains the 30s aesthetics) the final song playing over the credits ends with the famous phrase (seconds later followed by \\"...or is there?\\" and a sinister laugh).

Synopsis In the book Sussman traces intellectual enterprise, art, and artistic conventions since what he calls the \\"broader modernity\\" (marked by the end of the Medieval period in Europe) and suggests that art and its conventions have essentially become a secular institution that have essentially replaced the moral allegiances the subject owed to the Church before the reformation increasing a sense of personal freedom. Reception Critical reception for The Aesthetic Contract has been positive. In a review in The Comparatist David Halliburton wrote \\"In sum, The Aesthetic Contract is a strong, broad comparative study of major patterns in the modernity of the West from the time of the Protestant Reformation to our own, soon-to-expire, century.\\" A reviewer for Studies in Romanticism praised Sussman for the book's \\"steadfast refusal to sacrifice a genuine intellectual undertaking for such efficacity\\". Academic Geoffrey Galt Harpham was more mixed in his review, as he wrote that the \\"rhetoric of terror notwithstanding, The Aesthetic Contract displays perhaps an excessive ease, an unresisted 'liberty, while also stating \\"Can any such set of understandings or conventions as general as the ones Sussman imagines be conjured in terms that would be both useful and suggestive? Perhaps not. But the effort to bring into being, by sheer force of discourse, a shadowy but defining--what do we call it?--commands a certain respect; and the very incompleteness of the project may yet provoke further efforts, by Sussman and others.\\" References Critical theory 1997 non-fiction books ","title":"The Aesthetic Contract"},{"id":"48498826","text":"Carroll Freeman is an American operatic tenor, opera director, and music educator.

Plot The Country Doctor is set in a remote area of Quebec, Canada. The country doctor John Luke (Jean Hersholt) is an unlicensed general practitioner who cares for the residents of a small Canadian timber station taking much of his payment in barter. Having spent years operating from the station and from his own dwelling, and following a particularly bad epidemic of diphtheria in which several children die, the doctor decides to travel to Montreal to speak with the medical Managing Director of the region. The doctor's hope is that the director will try to get the rich corporation who owns the land to pay for a proper hospital. After trying unsuccessfully to make any headway and finding himself stymied by governmental red tape, he crashes a public dinner given by the medical association to argue his point in person. The timber corporation hears of this protest and sends their lawyers to take revenge on the doctor. During the course of the investigation the doctor's lack of a license is quickly discovered and the local police are informed that the doctor has been practicing illegally. The doctor returns to the timber station in low spirits. Before long, Asa Wyatt (John Qualen), one of the workers comes to the doctor's house with his pregnant wife (Aileen Carlyle). She is just about to give birth and the worker begs the doctor to help them despite his lack of a license. The local constabulary become involved and warn the doctor that he could face charges if he delivers the baby, but the doctor finds that he can't simply stand by passively and he starts to help the mother as the police berate him. After delivering the child, the doctor realizes that the birth is actually a multiple birth and the delivery continues until the doctor has delivered five babies.

Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a good review, describing it as \\"an honest film\\" and \\"admirably genuine\\". Greene praised Hersholt for \\"one of the most sympathetic performances [he had] seen this year\\", and noted that although those judging the film from the austerest angle might find the comic aspects of the film to be \\"not in the best taste\\", he himself found sequences like the delivery of quintuplets to have been \\"extraordinarily funny\\".

Background It is estimated that 2 million women in Africa contract obstetric fistula during labor, and while more than 500,000 die each year during pregnancy or childbirth, 80% of these deaths are avoidable. The film documents the people who have set a goal to rescue African women from the medical condition which causes affected women to become societal outcasts. Filmed in Kenya, Malawi and Sierra Leone, the film speaks toward Ann Gloag, a former nurse who pushes the movement to save these women, efforts to help the patients themselves, and speaks toward heir stories of personal struggle and triumph. The film ends with the Gladi Gladi ceremony, a singing and dancing celebratory event marking the day the women return home cured. Production Friedman had first met Ann Gloag in 2008, and after learning of her project, decided to make a film documenting her efforts. The film was eventually written by Iain Kennedy and co-directed by Kennedy and Adam Friedman, and produced by Friedman's Vertical Ascent in collaboration with The Freedom From Fistula Foundation, an organization founded and run by Scottish businesswoman, Ann Gloag. The foundation partnered with Opportunity Bank in Malawi to provide the newly-cured with a small solar-panel powered generator called a \\"BBOXX\\", to allow the women to earn money by charging fees to charge cell-phones, thus providing them with a business opportunity and allowing them to \\"become masters of their own destiny.\\" According to Adam Friedman, \\"Filming ‚ÄòShout‚Äô was an extraordinary experience. My wife and I were stopped at gunpoint in Malawi and were one of the last film crews shooting in Sierra Leone as the Ebola plague descended. But throughout, the wonderful people of Africa and the amazing work that Ann‚Äôs groups were doing inspired us to keep on keeping on.‚Äù Friedman was surprised at Meryl Streep's interest in being a part of the film. He had originally wished a narrator of her caliber, but did not think it was even possible. Urged by an acquaintance of his sister's, he sent Streep a copy of the film. One week later he received word from her office that she felt Gladi was so powerful a film she \\"felt the need to be involved.\\" Meryl Streep stated \\"This powerful film attests to the igniting power of one woman, Ann Gloag, to set in motion hundreds of helping hands, doctors, nurses, caregivers, family and friends, to resuscitate the health and status of victims of fistula, and to give them back their lives.\\" The first cut of the film was completed in September 2015, and according to Friedman, it was only missing the key piece of Meryl Streep.

The filmmakers behind ‚ÄúShout Gladi Gladi,‚Äù set in Sierra Leone and Malawi, found Meryl Streep, and her sympathy- rich voice does temper the horror and add glamour.\\" The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film was an \\"inessential doc about a charity doing badly needed work,\\" but praised Ann Gloag and Adam Friedman for their bringing attention to medical shortcomings in Africa. They wrote \\"It's tough work making a feel-good doc about obstetric fistula, a horrific condition afflicting millions of women and girls in Africa, but the celebratory title of Shout Gladi Gladi signals that Adam Friedman intends to do just that,\\" and concluded \\"The film is most intellectually stimulating when it ventures outside her group, to get big- picture commentary on public-health charities from Melinda Gates and Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka.\\" Film Journal International also praised the filmmakers, writing, \\"Fistula is the subject of this supremely compassionate documentary‚Äînot an easy subject, but the filmmakers should be saluted for tackling it in such an intelligent and thorough manner.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Shout Gladi Gladi at the Internet Movie Database * Shout Gladi Gladi at Rotten Tomatoes 2000s documentary films 2015 films Films shot in Malawi American documentary films Medical-themed films British documentary films American films English-language films American independent films Films shot in Sierra Leone Films shot in Kenya British independent films British films ","title":"Shout Gladi Gladi"},{"id":"48499486","text":"Thomas Blass is an American social psychologist, Holocaust survivor, and professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

Vilain's nickname was \\"Geeraard de Duivel\\" (\\"Geerard the Devil\\"), which was based on his dark complexion and hair color.http://www.duivelsteen.be/historiek.html In the 14th century the building became city property.

In 1830 the Geeraard de Duivelsteen became a fire station. Near the end of the 19th century it was bought by the Belgian state to serve as a national archive. For this purpose a new wing was built.
