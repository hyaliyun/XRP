Recording Dustin Payseur wrote and recorded a demo of the entire album in his apartment in New York before recording it professionally in a studio. Clash the Truth finished recording at the Excello Recording studio in the fall of 2012 after recording was interrupted when Payseur's studio was flooded during Hurricane Sandy. Clash the Truth featured new drummer Tommy Gardner, who allowed for a faster, more energetic sound than in previous releases. It also features collaborations with Kazu Makino of Blonde Redhead and Jack Tatum of Wild Nothing. Cover artwork The artwork used for Clash the Truth, designed by Captured Tracks founder Mike Sniper and Dustin Payseur, features black and white stills taken from the experimental video Three Transitions (1973) directed by Peter Campus. Reception Clash the Truth received mostly positive reviews from critics, some noting the more focused themes of adolescence and nostalgia as a sign of growth and maturity while continuing to refine their sound and style. In a lukewarm review for Pitchfork, Ian Cohen wrote that \\"The New York City dream pop band's second album sees them introduce a darker, more socially aware edge, though it trades their former instrumental rigidity for amiable, mid-fi college rock jangle.\\" Writing for Consequence of Sound, reviewer Paula Mejia rated the album a C+, stating that \\"Beach Fossils‚Äô Dustin Payseur strays from the syrupy reverb typically dominating Beach Fossils‚Äô breezy aesthetic, trading it in for torrential guitars and thrashing drums on his band's restless sophomore release.\\" She continued with \\"With Clash the Truth, Beach Fossils are driving away from the blinding sunlight and toward a shadowed elsewhere. What matters is that their eyes are trained forward.\\" In a similar review, The Quietus writer Ryan Foley commented on their production and songwriting by writing \\"Clash The Truth follows that 'Beach Fossils' template to a tee. What separates the album from previous releases is its robust sound.\\" while also commending this approach by writing \\"It's like Payseur went from doodling on Post-it notes to emblazoning missiles across the sky... In 'Careless' and 'Crashed Out', nervy, guitar jangle and punchy percussion come together in breakneck instrumental outros unlike anything Payseur has recorded previously.

In February 1968, she travelled on the Magga Dan to the Ross Sea. She was also among the first women to visit Cape Hallett. She wrote a book, The abominable snow- women, about her trip.  Early life and education  Dorothy Braxton was born in Dunedin. The family moved to Bluff when her father, D. E. S. Mason, was appointed chief engineer of the Bluff Harbour Board. She wrote stories from an early age and at six years old had her first piece accepted by the children‚Äôs editor of the Otago Daily Times. Later she attended Southland Girls‚Äô High School in Invercargill and Columba College in Dunedin.At Southland Girls‚Äô High School, she started a student-led newspaper. This was during wartime when paper was in short supply, but Dorothy managed to persuade the Southland Daily News to donate the newsprint from their allocation. At high school, Dorothy was told by the careers advisers that it was too hard for a girl to break into the male-dominated world of journalism. Despite this, she was accepted as a cadet reporter at the Southland Times. She later worked for the Southland News and the Christchurch Star and edited the New Zealand Home Journal magazine. In May 1965, she represented New Zealand at the first Asian-American Women Journalists‚Äô Conference in Honolulu. In 1948 she married John Braxton, a fellow journalist, and they had two children, Barrie and Barbara.  Antarctica  Dorothy could remember scrambling around the rocks of Bluff Hill as a child, feeling ‚Äúthe wind blowing on my face straight from the South Pole‚Äù and imagining she was on the polar plateau \\"struggling with huskies and sledges\\". She said that ‚Äúfrom the time I was old enough to realise that there was such a place as the Antarctic I had wanted to go there.‚Äù She became a member of the New Zealand Antarctic Society in the 1960s and regularly sought to travel to the Antarctic. For ten years, she wrote annually to the Admiral in charge of the United States Naval Support Force, Antarctica, asking if she could have visiting privileges, but she was always turned down, often on the grounds that there were no facilities available for women. She also approached the Antarctic Division of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) but was rebuffed there as well. Mr G.W. Markham, the Superintendent, said, ‚ÄúTaking a woman down to Scott Base, where we haven‚Äôt facilities for them anyway, would be just like opening Pandora‚Äôs box. And I‚Äôm not going to be the first to turn the key.‚Äù Later she recalled how she had ‚Äúbattled officialdom, asking only that we women be granted the same privileges as our male counterparts were given and be permitted to go to the ice‚Äù. Finally, in February 1968, she found a way around ‚Äúthe petticoat ban on women journalists working in the Antarctic‚Äù, thanks to Lars-Eric Lindblad, who had organised two tourist cruises to the Ross Sea and offered her a berth on board the Magga Dan. By now, Dorothy and her family were living in Christchurch and she was working for the New Zealand Woman‚Äôs Weekly. She regularly travelled around the South Island for her job, so the family was used to managing in her absence. Around this time Barbara, a teenager, was on a bus when she overheard two women talking about how ‚Äúthat Dorothy Braxton‚Äù was ‚Äúgoing away again on another trip. This time to the Antarctic.‚Äù Her companion responded, ‚ÄúThose poor helpless children of hers. How a mother can just go away and leave a family to fend for themselves like that‚Ä¶‚Äù Dorothy sailed on the second cruise, a month after Marie Darby (who sailed on both cruises) had become the first New Zealand woman to visit the Antarctic mainland. On this second trip, the Magga Dan with staff and 17 passengers on board sailed south via the Auckland Islands and Campbell Island; it visited the US bases at Cape Hallett and McMurdo Sound and New Zealand‚Äôs Scott Base. Dorothy noted in her book that \\"Our boots implanted the first feminine footprints at Cape Hallett and the first in Victoria Land on the mainland of Antarctica\\" and she was especially proud that \\"a New Zealand name headed the list of feminine signatures\\" at the US base there. A highlight was the visit to Scott Base, described by Lars-Eric Lindblad as \\"the nicest place in all Antarctica\\". On the return trip, the Magga Dan passed by the Balleny Islands and called in at Macquarie Island. Dorothy Braxton later wrote about the trip in her book The abominable snow- women. A reviewer called it ‚Äúa very readable book for those who would like to see the Antarctic through a woman's eyes‚Äù and added that ‚Äúmost women readers in particular would find it interesting.‚Äù  Later work and career  The Braxton family lived in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea (now Papua New Guinea) in the early 1970s. Dorothy continued to work as a journalist in Australia and in 1991, she travelled to the Arctic, fulfilling a long-held desire to ‚Äúgo north and reach as close to 77¬∞ 52' north as I could get to match the 77¬∞ 52' south I had achieved on the voyage south on the Magga Dan‚Äù and to find out ‚Äúhow the Arctic differed from the Antarctic and what were the similarities.‚Äù She wrote about her trip in The Canberra Times, concluding that ‚Äúboth ends of the world are wild, remote and beautiful. Let us hope it stays that way.‚Äù In 1998, she co-founded the Australian U3A Online Australia with Jack McDonell and Rick Swindell. In March 2011, she was granted an Honorary Life Membership in recognition of her work in establishing U3A Online.  Legacy  Dorothy Braxton was awarded the Centenary Medal and made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for services to adult education in 2001. She died in Australia on 3 September 2014, aged 87. A year after her death, three generations of her family travelled to Bluff to scatter her ashes at Stirling Point and to plant some trees in her memory at the Bluff Maritime Museum.

A Rose in the Twilight was released in August 11, 2017, created by Japanese game developer Nippon Ichi Software for the PlayStation Vita and Microsoft Windows. The game is directed and designed by Masayuki Furuya. The game's art style consists exclusively of white, black, grey, and red.  Plot  A young girl named Rose finds herself in an old castle frozen in time and overwhelmed by vines and thorns. A mysterious rose is attached to her waist, capable of absorbing the color red and expelling it into the castle; by default, almost the entire castle is in greyscale, with only the red splashes from the rose and other objects resuming time or giving life to objects. Rose soon finds a giant creature. While initially afraid of the creature, she warms up to it when it goes out of its way to protect her. Forming a bond with each other, Rose and the Giant decide to travel through the castle, hoping to find out why she has this rose and answer the mysteries surrounding this castle. There is little dialogue in the game; almost all plot events are shown through vignette recaps and flashbacks, as well as reading journal entries. Rose soon discovers that she is seemingly immortal; the power of the rose reconstitutes her no matter what happens to her body. Failure within a room simply restarts the room, and unlocking new areas of the castle sometimes requires gruesome self-sacrifices that only an immortal could unlock. The pair also finds another girl with a rose who looks suspiciously similar to Rose, Blanc, as a seeming antagonist.  Gameplay  The game consists largely of platforming puzzles that require control of both Rose and the Giant, which the player can switch between, and using the power of the rose to adjust the environment. Solving the puzzles and platforming well allow the pair to proceed to the next area as well as find hidden \\"bloodstains\\" which show past memories of the dead castle inhabitants. In general, the castle is grey and frozen; blocks will not fall, machines will not run, gears will not turn, etc. Rose can use her rose to store up the color red and drain it out of and into objects, freezing and unfreezing them, which allows the pair to advance. Different areas of the castle introduce different twists and mechanics, such as a watering can which can pour red liquid on plants, painting blood portraits, and traversing up clockwork towers where the pace of time can be controlled by blood. When a player attempts to advance to a new area of the castle, they need to have collected enough hidden bloodstains to make a sacrifice of blood via Rose's temporary death. The golem can fall any length without getting hurt, can walk through thorns, and can catch and throw objects including Rose herself. Players needs to make sure they use of both of their abilities to overcome the many obstacles in the castle.  Reception  A Rose in the Twilight got mildly positive reviews from critics according to review aggregator websites. Metacritic gave the game 75% and Gamerankings has it at 77% for critic impressions.

Among her admirers were Jacinto Benavente and the brothers Antonio and Manuel Machado. Biography Daughter of the Civil Guard Laureano Vello √Ålvarez and the laundress Benita Cano Rodr√≠guez. Her first notable appearances were as chorus girl in the Teatro de la Zarzuela in Madrid and her presence is also documented in the capital's Teatro Japon√©s around 1900. She apparently owed her nickname, \\"La Fornarina\\" (the baker girl) to the La √âpoca journalist Javier Beteg√≥n. She already appeared under the name at the Teatro Romea in Madrid, the Teatro Nuevo Retiro in Barcelona and the Salon Novedades in Valencia. From 1904, she became associated with the lyricist Jos√© Juan Cadenas. Her appearances abroad can be traced to 1905, in Lisbon's Coliseu dos Recreios. Soon, she became the star of the Teatro Lara, the Sal√≥n de Novedades and the Zarzuela in Madrid as well as the Pr√≠ncipe Real theatre in Oporto. Her grand entrance on the international scene was at the Parisian \\"Apollo Th√©atre\\" in 1907.

B. Ray) was an Indian physicist. He was a pioneer in the field of X-ray spectroscopy, and his laboratory was the first of its kind in India. Also notable are his contributions to studies related to scattering of light in the atmosphere. He played a significant role in facilitating contacts between Indian and European scientists. He was elected Fellow, Indian National Science Academy, and held the post of Khaira Professor of Physics at the Rajabazar Science College, University of Calcutta till the time of his death.  Early life  Bidhu Bhushan Ray was born on 1 July 1894 in Khadarpara, East Bengal, British India (now in Bangladesh). He completed his studies in Calcutta. His doctoral thesis was on the scattering of light in the atmosphere, carried out under the guidance of C. V. Raman. He obtained his D.Sc. in 1922. As part of his doctoral work, he gave a theory of glories, coronas and iridescent clouds, which is still considered relevant.  Career  In 1921, Ray was appointed as lecturer in Physics at the University College of Science and Technology, University of Calcutta, where he would remain until his death. In 1923, he secured two years of leave to travel to Europe. He spent a few months working with Manne Siegbahn in Uppsala, where he started experimental work in X-ray spectroscopy. He then moved to Copenhagen to work with Niels Bohr, to whom Raman had already introduced him. Ray spent over a year in Copenhagen, doing theoretical work related to X-ray spectra. After leaving Copenhagen, he visited a number of other laboratories in Germany and Italy before returning to India. Inspired by his stay in Europe, Ray decided to set up a laboratory for X-ray spectroscopy, which would be the first of its kind not only in Calcutta but in India. It was not easy to get the necessary financial support from the University of Calcutta. Bohr wrote as many as three letters to the University authorities recommending Ray's case for funding. In one of them he wrote: \\"‚Äû..Dr. Ray must be considered as unusually qualified for such work (X-ray spectra and their interpretation), ... having ... a thorough knowledge of the present stand of the theories\\" Ray was finally able to set up his research laboratory in 1927-28. Over the next fifteen years, he published a number of research papers in leading journals. Along with his work on X-ray spectroscopy, he also continued his meteorological studies. His laboratory became a training ground for young physicists, e.g. R. C. Majumdar. In 1935 he was appointed to the prestigious chair of Khaira Professor of Physics, a position he held until his untimely death.  Controversy  From 1930 onwards, Ray was involved in a scientific controversy. After the discovery of the Raman Effect, there was considerable international interest in trying to observe an analogous effect in X-rays. Researchers in the US and Germany had tried and reported negative results. In 1930, Bidhu Bhushan Ray reported, in a paper published in Nature, that he had observed additional spectral lines in scattered X-rays, which he interpreted as being analogous to Raman's observations. Immediately afterwards, J. M. Cork reported that he was unable to reproduce Ray's result. Ray wrote a rebuttal, and followed it up with more experimental work. The controversy continued for several years, and was finally settled in 1937 by Arnold Sommerfeld, who confirmed Ray's observations and also gave a detailed explanation of the phenomenon.  Death  Bidhu Bhushan Ray died of a heart attack on 29 July 1944, less than a month after his fiftieth birthday. Some of his family members believe that the controversy mentioned above was directly responsible for his death. Oral history has it that a demonstration was set up in his laboratory, where some colleagues and visitors were to be shown the extra spectral lines. When the visitors arrived, the demonstration did not work. Ray was ridiculed for this failure, and the resulting humiliation precipitated his heart attack. However, researcher Rajinder Singh, on the basis of his study of original documents, argues that this is not likely. He points out that the controversy had already been resolved in 1937, following Sommerfeld's work, more than six years before Ray's death. Moreover, the experiment required many hours of running time. Thus visual demonstration was not possible. Singh further notes that Ray had been suffering from malaria and other ailments, which may have played a role in his early death.  Other contributions  Apart from his teaching and research work, Ray was also interested in the dissemination of science to a wider audience. He was a founding member and Secretary of the Indian Science News Association, established in 1935. He edited its journal, Science and Culture.  Awards and Honours  * Elected Fellow, National Institute of Science of India (later renamed Indian National Science Academy) in 1935 * Appointed Khaira Professor of Physics, University of Calcutta, in 1935 * Elected President, Physics Section, Indian Science Congress (1942)  Legacy  After C. V. Raman, B.B. Ray was the first Indian physicist to set up a research laboratory which yielded results that could be published in leading journals such as Nature. This undoubtedly provided an impetus to experimental physics in the country. While Ray received recognition in his lifetime, he was almost forgotten in the intervening decades, until a recent revival of interest. Rajinder Singh, who has written a book on Ray, calls him \\"an unsung hero in Indian science\\". Singh also argues that Ray's contacts with European scientists were important in themselves, and also facilitated such contacts for other Indian scientists, notably S. N. Bose and M. N. Saha. The Indian Science News Association continues its activities, including the publication of Science and Culture.

These graphs are called the half graphs because they have approximately half of the edges of a complete bipartite graph on the same vertices. The name was given to these graphs by Paul Erd≈ës and Andr√°s Hajnal. Definition To define the half graph on 2n vertices u_1,dots u_n and v_1,dots v_n, connect u_i to v_j by an edge whenever ile j. The same concept can also be defined in the same way for infinite graphs over two copies of any ordered set of vertices. The half graph over the natural numbers (with their usual ordering) has the property that each vertex v_j has finite degree, at most j. The vertices on the other side of the bipartition have infinite degree. Irregularity One application for the half graph occurs in the Szemer√©di regularity lemma, which states that the vertices of any graph can be partitioned into a constant number of subsets of equal size, such that most pairs of subsets are regular (the edges connecting the pair behave in certain ways like a random graph of some particular density). If the half graph is partitioned in this way into k subsets, the number of irregular pairs will be at least proportional to k. Therefore, it is not possible to strengthen the regularity lemma to show the existence of a partition for which all pairs are regular. Matching The half graph has a unique perfect matching. This is straightforward to see by induction: u_n must be matched to its only neighbor, v_n, and the remaining vertices form another half graph. More strongly, every bipartite graph with a unique perfect matching is a subgraph of a half graph. In graphs of uncountable chromatic number If the chromatic number of a graph is uncountable, then the graph necessarily contains as a subgraph a half graph on the natural numbers. This half graph, in turn, contains every complete bipartite graph in which one side of the bipartition is finite and the other side is countably infinite.

Administratively it is treated as part of the Domsdorf quarter of the rural Uebigau-Wahrenbr√ºck municipality in the state of Brandenburg. Overview Alwine is located on the west side of the L65 (local road) and has approximately 20 inhabitants (2017). It comprises five semi-detached houses, one detached family house, one detached double family house, two multi-family houses and several outbuildings, sheds and garages. Its origins date back to the nineteenth century when some of the factory buildings created for the nearby brown-coal mine began, little by little, to be adapted for residential use. The name \\"Alwine\\" is thought to have been the name of a wife or daughter of a mine owner/director from the middle part of the nineteenth century. After the changes which led, in 1990, to German reunification, brown-coal operations in the area quickly came to an end. There being no alternative sources of employment in the area, people drifted away. The entire 1.6 hectare settlement was sold by auction on 9 December 2017 as a single plot for ‚Ç¨140,000  \\"a settlement with the character of a village\\" as it is described in the auctioneer's brochure. After the mine closed two brothers had purchased the site in 2001 and there was talk of investing in the settlement to benefit from its inherent village charms, but since then one of the two brothers has died. Significant investment never materialised and the estimated rental income from the village is thought to have slipped to a little over 50% of the level envisaged in the original purchase contract.

Known for her studies on the membrane structure of red blood cells, Basu is an elected fellow of the all the three major Indian science academies namely National Academy of Sciences, India, the Indian Academy of Sciences and the Indian National Science Academy as well as the Indian Society for Chemical Biology. The Department of Biotechnology of the Government of India awarded her the National Bioscience Award for Career Development, one of the highest Indian science awards, for her contributions to biosciences in 2002.  Biography  Bose Institute. Parul Chakrabarti - Basu's mentor at Bose Institute Born on 17 December 1957 in the Indian state of West Bengal, Joyoti Basu did her undergraduate studies at the Presidency College, Kolkata and after completing the BSc honors in chemistry, she obtained an MSc from the University of Calcutta. Her doctoral research was at the Bose Institute, Kolkata under the guidance of Parul Chakrabarti, which earned her a PhD from Calcutta University. She did her post-doctoral work at the laboratory of Jean-Marie Ghuysen at the University of Liege working on mycobacterial cell division and mycobacterial peptidoglycan-biosynthesizing enzymes. She joined Bose Institute in 1991 as a faculty member at the department of Chemistry and retired in June, 2018. Basu resides along Madhab Chatterjee Street in Kolkata.  Controversy  Basu's alleged scientific misconduct has been noted widely and has even been covered in media. She is widely alleged to have duplicated images leading to retraction of two papers, correction of another two, and, many alleged instances of misconduct listed on Pubpeer. Basu has retracted a few of her papers. This includes an article published in The Journal of Immunology.  Legacy  Red Blood Cells Basu's research is focused on the cellular and molecular biology of mycobacteria. During the initial stages of her career, she worked on the membrane structure of red blood cells and her research is reported to have assisted in widening the understanding of apoptosis of nucleated mammalian cells and the physiology of the red cell that lacked a cell nucleus. Her association with her mentor, Parul Chakrabarti, during her doctoral research days, precipitated the studies of the biosynthetic pathways of fatty acids in relation to cell wall building and the functions of penicillin-binding proteins. She is known to be the first scientist to propose that the removal of the aged or oxidatively stressed red blood cells from the circulatory system causes cellular death. Later she moved on to the biological study of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a pathogenic bacteria causing tuberculosis, with regard to its host-pathogen interaction and her studies revealed the mechanisms of macrophage apoptosis as well as the relationship between host cell signaling and innate immune response. In 2007, the team led by Basu and her college mate from the Presidency College, Manikuntala Kundu, were successful in identifying a protein in Mycobacterium tuberculosis which caused weakening of the immune system of the host. They found that the protein, named Early Secreted Antigen 6, which bound themselves on Toll-like receptor 2 of the host, hindered the production of cytokines, a type of protein which helped the immune system to fight the tuberculosis bacteria. The discovery also has reported importance in the therapeutics of diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. The achievement was later published as an article, Direct extracellular interaction between the early secreted antigen ESAT-6 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and TLR2 inhibits TLR signaling in macrophages in Nature Immunology journal in 2007. Her studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and ResearchGate, an online repository of scientific articles has listed 77 of them. Besides, she has mentored several research scholars in their doctoral studies. Basu is a member of the executive committee of the Indian Society of Cell Biology and is a former Treasurer of the Society. She is credited with contributing to the establishment of a program on Systems Biology at the Bose Institute. She is also a former associate editor of the Journal of Immunology and is an Academic Editor of PLoS One.

He started his career with W&G; Records in 1956 as a sales representative; he became their in-house producer and A&R; agent before leaving in 1966. Tudor briefly joined Astor Records as their promotions manager until 1968 when he created his own production company, June Productions. He followed with his own record label, Fable Records, late in 1969 and continued as its CEO until he sold the company in July 1984. In June 1979 Tudor was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, \\"For service to the recording industry\\". At the APRA Music Awards of 1996 he received the Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Services to Australian Music. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999 he received a Special Achievement Award, which was shared with Bill Armstrong of Armstrong Studios.  Early life  Ronald Stewart Tudor was born on 18 May 1924 in Toora, Victoria, a rural town in a dairy farming district. He was one of ten children. During World War II he enlisted in the Australian Army in February 1943 and was discharged in May 1946 with the rank of gunner.  Career  Tudor became a sales representative for W&G; Records in 1956. As the label's A&R; and in-house producer he signed and recorded early material for Ernie Sigley, \\"Love Is a Golden Ring\\" (1957); Diana Trask, \\"Going Steady\\" (1958); and the Seekers, Introducing the Seekers (1963). He recorded an instrumental track, \\"Wild Weekend\\" (February 1961), by rock-and-rollers the Thunderbirds after they had been recommended by a local radio DJ, Stan Rofe. Tudor later recalled, \\"We had a very good relationship with [Rofe] at 3KZ. He was a wonderful supporter of us and he always said, 'It's about time someone got into local talent'.\\" Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane said that it was \\"one of the most successful Australian instrumental singles of all-time\\" alongside the Atlantics' \\"Bombora\\". Tudor produced further work by the Thunderbirds and used them to back other artists on their recordings. Another recommendation from Rofe was Johnny Chester, who had already worked with the Thunderbirds. They provided backing on Chester's debut single, \\"Hokey Pokey\\" (May 1961). Tudor continued with W&G; until 1966 when he joined rival label Astor Records as a promotions manager. For recordings he used Armstrong Studios founded by Bill Armstrong (manager at W&G; Records) in 1965. He continued with that label until 1968 when he started his own company, June Productions. = Fable Records = Tudor had established an independent record label, Fable Records, in late 1969 with an official launch the following April. During 1969 Tudor had appeared on a TV talent quest, New Faces, as a judge. He signed both the finals winner, John Williamson, and second place getter, Liv Maessen, to Fable. Maessen's second single was a cover version of Mary Hopkin's \\"Knock, Knock Who's There?\\" (April 1970), which peaked at No. 2 on the Go-Set National Top 60 Singles Chart in August. Williamson's debut single, \\"Old Man Emu\\" (May 1970), peaked at No. 3 in September. From May to December 1970 the Australian music industry was embroiled in a \\"pay per play\\" dispute, 1970 radio ban, which hampered the airplay of both local artists and United Kingdom artists on major labels. Under the ban Hopkins' version of \\"Knock, Knock Who's There?\\" was not aired on commercial radio, whereas Maessen's version was. Go-Sets chart compiler, Ed Nimmervoll, acknowledged both artists on their National Top 60, which was given as \\"Mary Hopkins/Liv Maesson\\". Due to the radio ban Fable Records had further chart success with the Mixtures' cover version of \\"In the Summertime\\", originally by UK group Mungo Jerry, which reached No. 1 in August for nine weeks. Melbourne band Jigsaw (Chester's sometime backing band) on Fable Records and Sydney band Autumn on Chart Records both had success with their respective versions of UK group Christie's hit song \\"Yellow River\\". \\"Yellow River\\" displaced \\"In the Summertime\\" at No. 1 in late October. For a short period, the ban had the inadvertent effect of putting more local musicians to air than ever before and also opened the door to the underground artists on previously minor labels such as Fable Records. In the following year Tudor organised for a studio band, Drummond ‚Äì essentially members of an Adelaide-formed group, Allison Gros ‚Äì to record a novelty version of \\"Daddy Cool\\" (July 1971), originally by US 1950s group the Rays. According to McFarlane, \\"[Drummond]'s gimmicky trademark was to utilise chipmunk voices mixed in with normal vocal sounds.\\" It displaced \\"Eagle Rock\\" by local band Daddy Cool from the number-one spot in September. \\"Daddy Cool\\" held the top spot for eight weeks and stayed in the charts for 22 weeks. In that time Allison Gros had changed their name to Mississippi, while Tudor used the Drummond name for studio musicians, which issued two further singles. = Bootleg Records = Tudor founded Fable's sub- label, Bootleg Records, in late 1971 in partnership with Brian Cadd ‚Äì previously a member of the Groop (1964‚Äì69) and Axiom (1969‚Äì71) ‚Äì as inhouse producer and A&R; agent. Cadd started his solo career and also formed a studio ensemble, the Bootleg Family Band (1972‚Äì75), to back his solo and other artists' work via the Bootleg label. Bootleg's first hit was Mississippi's \\"Kings of the World\\" (January 1972) which reached No. 10. Cadd's debut solo single, \\"Ginger Man\\", appeared in August and peaked at No. 16. In June 1979 Tudor was installed as a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire with the citation \\"For service to the recording industry\\". Tudor continued with Fable Records into the early 1980s but later described how \\"his refusal to take part in the Radio Ban led to Fable being 'blackballed' by the major labels and that his business was effectively strangled [due to] its inability to get records distributed\\". He sold the label to John McDonald in July 1984. In the following October he joined Armstrong Studios, which was renamed as AAV Studios. Tudor retired form the music industry by the late 1980s.  Publication  In September 1988 Tudor wrote an article for The Sound Engineering Magazine detailing Metropolis Audio's Studio Three, \\"From an acoustic viewpoint, a lot of the possible problems were eliminated with exhaustive acoustic tests during the latter part of studio construction and equipment installation, wiring...\\"  Honors, awards, distinctions  In June 1979 Ron Tudor was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, \\"For service to the recording industry\\". At the APRA Music Awards of 1996 he received the Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Services to Australian Music. In 1999 the Australian Recording Industry Association acknowledged Tudor's and Armstrong's work for Australian music by presenting each with a Special Achievement Award.

According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Al-Baghuz Fawqani had a population of 10,649 in the 2004 census. Syrian Civil War During the course of the Syrian Civil War, the Baghuz area (including the nearby town Baghuz at-Tahtani) came under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) jihadist organization. The area was initially administered by ISIL's Euphrates Province, but later transferred to al-Barakah district. During a multi-year campaign in eastern Syria, the town was captured from ISIL by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) on 23 January 2019, leaving ISIL completely besieged in the town of Al-Marashidah, to the north. However, on the next day, ISIL launched a series of suicide attacks to break the siege, allowing them to recapture parts of the town (mostly the western parts of the town), with the town's outskirts being targeted by air raids of the international coalition. On 7 February 2019, the SDF captured Al-Marashidah and other nearby areas from ISIL, completely besieging ISIL in the town of Al- Baghuz Fawqani, the final settlement under its control in the Levant. =Battle of Baghuz Fawqani= Map of the military movements during the final segment of the battle, after 12 February 2019. Syrian government territory is situated west and south of the riverbend. On 9 February 2019, the Syrian Democratic Forces, supported by the CJTF-OIR Coalition, launched a final assault to take Baghuz Fawqani and wipe out the last bastion of physical territory held by the Islamic State, opening the attack with a massive bombardment on the Huwayjat Khanafirah neighborhood, with violent clashes continuing throughout the night and into the morning hours. The Coalition said it struck a mosque in Baghuz Fawqani on 11 February, as it was being used as a command and control center by the Islamic State. On 28 February, SDF spokesman Adnan Afrin announced discovery of a mass grave found 10 days ago in the town. It contained dozens of bodies, including of men and women while heads were also found in the grave. The SDF was trying to confirm whether they were Yazidis and Islamic State members. A video of Furat FM showed a mass-grave. The outlet's executive said that most of the bodies were apparently shot in the head. SDF spokeswoman Lilwa Abdulla confirmed they found large number of Yazidi bodies though there was no specific number. However, locals said the corpses were victims of airstrikes. The assault to take the town resumed on 1 March, with the remaining ISIL militants and their families besieged and encamped at a tent city along the river. On 19 March, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali announced that the SDF had control of all of Al-Baghuz Fawqani, with the exception for a few pockets along the shores of the Euphrates river, where intermittent clashes were still ongoing with resisting jihadists. On Saturday, 23 March 2019, SDF forces, backed by the US, retook all of Al-Baghuz Fawqani, ending ISIL's territorial rule over Syria and depriving the group of its final \\"capital,\\" as well as removing almost all of the territory under their control.

Active from 1960, the brigade provided air defense for the Leningrad area with S-75 Dvina and S-125 missiles. It reequipped with S-300PS missiles in the early 1990s, and inherited the lineage of a disbanded unit to become the 157th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade and then the 1490th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment in 1993 and 1994.  History  Launching of an S-125 of the type used by the brigade The brigade was originally formed as the 86th Air Defense Brigade of Special Designation, a unit of System-100, the Leningrad air defense missile system, in 1959. It was the third brigade of the system to be formed and was based at Steklyanny, near Ulyanovka. The brigade became operational in May 1960 with eight battalions of S-75 Dvina missiles, and was redesignated the 86th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade in August. In the second half of 1964 the brigade was reinforced with six missile battalions equipped with the S-125, several of which were mobilization units. In 1967, the brigade was directly subordinated to the 6th Independent Air Defense Army when the air defense missile system was abolished as an independent headquarters. By an order of 5 October of that year, the Order of the Red Banner awarded to the 192nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment on 9 February 1944 was inherited by the 86th Brigade. The 192nd provided air defense for Leningrad during the Siege of Leningrad in World War II. In May 1944 it was reorganized as the 48th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Brigade, and in August 1945 became the 961st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment. Cadres from the 961st were used to form the 86th Brigade in the late 1950s. In 1986, the 86th became part of the 54th Air Defense Corps. In 1990, it began replacing its S-75s and S-125s with the new S-300PS in two groups of battalions. By a directive of 15 February 1993, the lineage of the disbanded 169th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment was transferred to the brigade, which became the 157th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade. In the summer of 1994, it was reorganized into the 1490th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment.

Rules In this game, one player controls the position of a given number of cops and the other player controls the position of a robber. The cops are trying to catch the robber by moving to the same position, while the robber is trying to remain uncaught. Thus, the players perform the following actions, taking turns with each other: *On the first turn of the game, the player controlling the cops places each cop on a vertex of the graph (allowing more than one cop to be placed on the same vertex). *Next, the player controlling the robber places the robber on a vertex of the graph. *On each subsequent turn, the player controlling the cops chooses a (possibly empty) subset of the cops, and moves each of these cops to adjacent vertices. The remaining cops (if any) stay put. *On the robber's turn, he may either move to an adjacent vertex or stay put. The game ends with a win for the cops whenever the robber occupies the same vertex as a cop. If this never happens, the robber wins. The cop number of a graph G is the minimum number k such that k cops can win the game on G. Example On a tree, the cop number is one. The cop can start anywhere, and at each step move to the unique neighbor that is closer to the robber. Each of the cop's steps reduces the size of the subtree that the robber is confined to, so the game eventually ends. By gradually moving closer together, two cops can eventually catch a robber on any cycle (here, a baseball diamond) On a cycle graph of length more than three, the cop number is two. If there is only one cop, the robber can move to a position two steps away from the cop, and always maintain the same distance after each move of the robber. In this way, the robber can evade capture forever. However, if there are two cops, one can stay at one vertex and cause the robber and the other cop to play in the remaining path. If the other cop follows the tree strategy, the robber will eventually lose. General results Every graph whose girth is greater than four has cop number at least equal to its minimum degree. It follows that there exist graphs of arbitrarily high cop number. Henri Meyniel (also known for Meyniel graphs) conjectured in 1985 that every connected n-vertex graph has cop number O(sqrt n). The Levi graphs (or incidence graphs) of finite projective planes have girth six and minimum degree Omega(sqrt n), so if true this bound would be the best possible. All graphs have sublinear cop number. One way to prove this is to use subgraphs that are guardable by a single cop: the cop can move to track the robber in such a way that, if the robber ever moves into the subgraph, the cop can immediately capture the robber. Two types of subgraph that are guardable are the closed neighborhood of a single vertex, and a shortest path between any two vertices. The Moore bound in the degree diameter problem implies that at least one of these two kinds of guardable sets has size Omega(log n/loglog n). Using one cop to guard this set and recursing within the connected components of the remaining vertices of the graph shows that the cop number is at most O(nloglog n/log n). A more strongly sublinear upper bound on the cop number, :frac{n}{2^{(1-o(1))sqrt{log n}}}, is known. However the problems of obtaining a tight bound, and of proving or disproving Meyniel's conjecture, remain unsolved. It is even unknown whether the soft Meyniel conjecture, that there exists a constant c<1 for which the cop number is always O(n^c), is true. Computing the cop number of a given graph is EXPTIME- hard, and hard for parameterized complexity. Special classes of graphs The cop-win graphs are the graphs with cop number equal to one. Every planar graph has cop number at most three. More generally, every graph has cop number at most proportional to its genus. However, the best known lower bound for the cop number in terms of the genus is approximately the square root of the genus, which is far from the upper bound when the genus is large. The treewidth of a graph can also be obtained as the result of a pursuit-evasion game, but one in which the robber can move along arbitrary-length paths instead of a single edge in each turn. This extra freedom means that the cop number is generally smaller than the treewidth. More specifically, on graphs of treewidth w, the cop number is at most lfloor w/2rfloor+1.

The monument's outline was probably built by Jean de Marville and Claus de Werve, and completed by Claus Sluter.Foss (2008), 172Sadler (2005), 46 De Malouel was the official painter to the duke, and was the first sculptor commissioned for the tomb'.Morand, Kathleen. \\"'Les Pleurants dans l'Art du Moyen Age en Europe' at Dijon\\". Burlington Magazine, volume 113, No. 823, 1971. 620-624. Today, it is housed in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Dijon. The tomb art developed by De Marville and Sluter became widely influential in the following decades and greatly improved the artist's prestige.Sadler (2005), 47 Jean, Duke of Berry commissioned a similar work for his burial,Woods (2007), 132 and it inspired the well known Mourners of Dijon, which were crafted a generation later. Background and commission Detail of Philip's death mask and angle wings Philip acquired the domain of Champmol, near Dijon, in 1378 to build the Carthusian monastery Chartreuse de Champmol, which he intended to house the tombs of his dynasty. He commissioned Jean de Marville in 1381 to \\"make an alabaster sepulcher for him in Dijon.\\"Jugie (2010), 38 De Marville began the project in 1834, when employed artisans to cut and shape the alabaster for the arcades. The following he organised the arrival of one large, and several smaller blocks of black Dinant marble. Philip the Bold died in 1404, and his wife Margaret III, Countess of Flanders the following year. She had decided to rest her remains with those of her parents in Lille, and Philip had been planning a single monument for himself for over twenty years, having commissioned Jean de Marville in 1381. Work did not begin until 1384, and proceeded slowly, with Claus Sluter being put in charge in 1389. At the Duke's death in 1404, only two mourners and the framework were complete; John the Fearless gave Sluter four years to finish the job, but he died after two. His nephew and assistant, Claus de Werve took over and finished the sculptures in 1410. The effigies were painted by Malouel.Jugie, Sophie. \\"Les Ducs de Bourgogne\\". Mus√©es de Bourgogne, 2003. Retrieved 5 September. 13-14 Claus Sluter and Phillip van Eram were employed in 1439 to polish the work., while van Eram's main contribution was in adding to outlines of the capitals above the mourners, while Sluter designed the mourners themselves, the cherubs above them, and the detail in the arches of the niches. By then the work seems to have been under Sluter's ownership since 1397, and the preparatory work was brought to Champmol, in Paris, where the final masonry work began. In 1402 the tomb had become so large that Sluter was forced to break through the wall around the designated area. The tomb was not finished in time for Philip's death in 1404; while the structure and arcades were in place, the effigies and mourners were yet to be carved. His son, John the Fearless, was known as a ruthless and unscrupulous politician, and assumed control of the project.Jugie (2010), 39 Philip was ultimately buried in the choir, on 16 June 1404, although his organs were sent to the church of Saint Martin at Halle. In 1792, his body was re-interred at Dijon Cathedral.Moffitt, John. \\"Sluter's \\"Pleurants\\" and Timanthes' \\"Tristitia Velata\\": Evolution of, and Sources for a Humanist Topos of Mourning\\".

She was amongst the Silence Breakers who were named Time Person of the Year in 2017.  Early life and education  Kidd studied print journalism and linguistics at the University of Southern California, where she earned a dual honours degree in 2007. She moved to the University of Rochester for her graduate studies, where she worked in brain and cognitive studies and earned her PhD in 2013. She worked with Richard Aslin, an expert on infant learning. She held visiting positions at the Stanford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Research and career  Kidd works on curiosity and exploration throughout early development. She was hired as Assistant Professor at the University of Rochester in 2012. She has studied the willpower of children, challenging the Stanford marshmallow experiment. She demonstrated that children's willpower is influenced by their superior's reliability and trust. Kidd was made Director of the Rochester Baby Lab at the University of Rochester in 2014. She moved to the University of California, Berkeley in June 2018. She has studied why it is so difficult to shake a false belief, such as believing in flat earth or climate change denial. Kidd is interested in the neuroscience of curiosity. She demonstrated that uncertainty can lead to the most curiosity. = #MeToo advocacy = After years of \\"unbearable and unrelenting sexual harassment\\" from fellow University of Rochester psychology academic Florian Jaeger, Kidd submitted complaints to the University of Rochester Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Jaeger was accused of having sexual relationships with students, using sexual innuendo that made people uncomfortable and holding retreats off-site that included hot tubs and recreational drug use. The first complaint was made against Jaeger in 2013, but the University decided to award him tenure.\\"This grad student says her professor harassed her. Her life changed. Did his?,\\" Vox, 14 December 2017. There were protests from students on campus, which eventually led to the resignation of University of Rochester President, Joel Seligman. Despite receiving complaints from seven current and former professors, the University cleared Jaeger of all violations of harassment and discrimination. During the investigation, the University promoted Jaeger to full Professor. Kidd was one of nine faculty members who sued the University over their mishandling of the case. In 2018, Kidd left the University of Rochester due to its inability to handle the sexual harassment allegations against Jaeger. As of 2019, six faculty members, including Richard Aslin, have left the University, taking $10 million of grant funding. Aslin had worked for the University for 32 years. Kidd has since become a campaigner to end sexual harassment in academia. Kidd was made a leader in the Me Too movement in academia, and one of several advocates selected as TIME Magazine Person of the Year. She has criticised how universities are expected to \\"investigate themselves\\" when it comes to complaints about sexual harassment. She believes that public pressure and increased transparency will help to transform academia. In March 2020, Dr. Kidd and the other plaintiffs settled with the University or Rochester, through their attorney Dr. Ann Olivarius, for $9.4 million.\\"University of Rochester and plaintiffs settle sexual harassment lawsuit for $9.4 million,\\" Science, 27 March 2020.\\"Rochester Settles Sex Harassment Case for $9.4M,\\" Inside HigherEd, 30 March 2020.

The line is, with the exception of the Sch√∂nebeck (Elbe)‚ÄìSch√∂nebeck- Salzelmen section, single track and not electrified.  History The line was opened in two sections. The Sch√∂nebeck‚ÄìSta√üfurt section was opened on 12 May 1857. The line was operated by the Magdeburg-Leipzig Railway Company (Magdeburg-Leipziger Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). Together with the main line, branches were built to the salt pans in Sch√∂nebeck and Sta√üfurt and a freight line was built from Sta√üfurt to L√∂derburg.Official Journal of the Royal Government of Magdeburg of 1857. A lignite mine was also opened near the line in Eggersdorf in the same year. The main purpose of the line was to promote the development of mines in order to increase freight traffic. Stations were built on the line in Eggersdorf, Eickendorf and F√∂rderstedt. On 12 April 1866, the Magdeburg‚ÄìHalberstadt Railway Company (Magdeburg-Halberst√§dter Eisenbahngesellschaft) opened a line from Bernburg via G√ºsten to Aschersleben with a branch from G√ºsten to Sta√üfurt. This created a continuous route from Magdeburg via Sta√üfurt to Aschersleben. The Magdeburg-Halberstadt Railway took over the Magdeburg-Leipzig Railway in 1876. It, in turn, was taken over by the state of Prussia in 1879. Also in the 1870s, the Berlin‚ÄìBlankenheim railway was built as part of the Kanonenbahn (\\"cannons railway\\") project, which connected G√ºsten on the one hand directly to Berlin, and, on the other hand, to Thuringia and Hesse. G√ºsten became a large railway junction. The shortest connection between the cities (now state capitals) of Magdeburg and Erfurt runs over the Sch√∂nebeck‚ÄìG√ºsten railway. In 1929, for example, a pair of semi- fast trains (Eilz√ºge) operated on this line. A pair of express trains (D-Z√ºge) running between Berlin and Mainz/Wiesbaden also used the line. Services from Magdeburg to Bad Salzelmen had already been intensified at that time, while on the other sections passenger trains ran approximately hourly. In 1974, Sch√∂nebeck-Salzelmen was connected to the network of the Magdeburg S-Bahn. This required the electrification of the Sch√∂nebeck-Sch√∂nebeck-Salzelmen section. In the winter of 1975, three pairs of express trains operated between Magdeburg and Erfurt, stopping in Sch√∂nebeck, Sta√üfurt and G√ºsten. About half of the passenger trains from Sch√∂nebeck ran towards G√ºsten and Aschersleben, while the rest ended in G√ºsten or continued south to Sangerhausen.DR Winter 1975 timetable Services on the line were similar in the 1991/92 timetable. According to the law of 23 August 1999 implementing the state development plan of Saxony-Anhalt, passenger services of InterRegio quality were to be made available between Magdeburg and Erfurt. An upgrade of the Erfurt‚Äìport of Rostock route via G√ºsten and Sch√∂nebeck for freight transport was planned. From 2000, the Berlin‚ÄìWernigerode excursion train was routed over the Sch√∂nebeck‚ÄìG√ºsten line, because the Berlin‚ÄìBlankenheim railway had been abandoned northeast of G√ºsten. In the same year, class 218 diesel locomotives were briefly used to haul passenger trains; these were then replaced by locomotives of class 232. In 2003, the line was included in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan). The double tracking of the line to enable a maximum line speed of 120 km/h was envisaged. Passenger traffic has been mainly operated with Siemens Desiro Classic (class 642) diesel railcars since 2006. In the same year, the DB Regio subsidiary Elbe Saale Bahn began operations of the Magdeburg‚ÄìAschersleben Regionalbahn service, while Deutsche Bahn continued to operate Regional-Express services between Magdeburg and Erfurt. The line south of Sch√∂nebeck-Salzelmen was connected to an electronic interlocking on 30 May 2007.  Current use  The line is used by regional and freight traffic. A Regionalbahn service operates on the line from Magdeburg Hauptbahnhof via Sch√∂nebeck, Sta√üfurt and G√ºsten to Aschersleben. It is operated by DB Regio under the brand name of Elbe Saale Bahn. Alternating Regional-Express services operate on the Magdeburg‚ÄìErfurt route, stopping only in Sch√∂nebeck, Sta√üfurt and G√ºsten. The S1 service of the Mittelelbe S-Bahn also runs between Sch√∂nebeck and Sch√∂nebeck-Salzelmen. The regional passenger services are now operated with Siemens Desiro Classic diesel sets and the S-Bahn trains by class 425 sets.  Prospects In the future, Deutsche Bahn plans to invest ‚Ç¨1.6 billion in the rail network of Saxony-Anhalt. The Sch√∂nebeck‚ÄìG√ºsten railway would also be upgraded. The DB expects to raise the speed to a maximum of 120 kilometres per hour with travel time reductions of between three and ten minutes.

The ship is named after the sea bird petrel. In 2016, Allen purchased the offshore service vessel formerly named Seven Petrel from Subsea 7, a subsea engineering, construction, and services company. In 2017, the ship completed an extensive retrofitting to become a deep-submergence research vessel. It is the only privately owned vessel in the world equipped to explore depths. It also serves as a testing bed for new deep-sea equipment that has never been deployed on any other ship.  Philanthropy  The primary mission of the ship, which is fully funded by Allen's estate, is to explore historically significant wrecks at challenging depths and conditions. A precondition set by Allen is for discovered wrecks to be respected as war graves and their locations kept secret, but known to only national governments and museums. In the nationally televised PBS documentary USS Indianapolis Live from the Deep, Allen said, \\"We've done a number of these explorations to try to find sunken warships. We try to do these both as really exciting examples of underwater archaeology and as tributes to the brave men [who] went down on these ships.\\" Petrel, while at dock, sometimes conducts walking tours and serves as an educational platform for students and children. Petrels other mission profile includes hosting scientific projects under Allen's mother company, Vulcan Inc.  Collaborative work  RV Petrel coordinates all its exploration with different organizations around the world. For United States Navy wrecks, Petrel collaborates with the Naval History and Heritage Command. In the Philippines, the crew works with the National Museum and the Battle of Surigao Strait Memorial Council. In 2018, Petrel worked with Australian National Maritime Museum to explore . Robert Kraft, who serves as subsea director for Allen, and Paul Mayer, Petrels lead researcher, traveled to Japan to hand over ROV video of Imperial Japanese Navy wrecks to the Yamato Museum. Crew Before Petrel, the project crew was aboard Allen's operating the megayacht's manned-submersible Pagoo, Argus 3000 remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and Bluefin 12D autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The 20 marine crew and 10 project crew work on 12-hour shifts aboard Petrel. The project crew consists of Kraft the expedition leader, Mayer as lead researcher, four ROV pilots and technicians, one AUV specialist, one multibeam surveyor, one videographer, and one systems support engineer. For each expedition, Petrel invites local historians, scientists, and observers to complement the project crew.  Crew expeditions in 2015 aboard Octopus  = Ironbottom Sound expedition = The team, while onboard Octopus, mapped of Ironbottom Sound in January 2015, identified 29 wreck locations, seven wreck debris fields, and several possible plane locations.

Ship details Following the Musashi discovery and the Hood expedition in 2015, Allen bought Petrel in 2016 to become a dedicated research and exploration platform. After a 2016‚Äì2017 retrofit, Petrel is now equipped with state-of-the-art technology and the latest systems integration to allow deep- sea search. The vessel now has a depth-capable ROV, an AUV, and a multibeam echo-sounder.

Petrel expeditions in 2017  = Artigliere = Petrel found the Italian Regia Marina World War II destroyer Artigliere in March 2017. = USS Indianapolis = Petrel found in August 2017. One of the most elusive shipwrecks in history, Indianapolis was finally located on 19 August 2017 at a depth of in the Philippine Sea. The discovery became headline news around the world and introduced Petrel as Paul Allen's newest addition to his expedition fleet. Kraft said of the elusive Indianapolis, \\"We did 18 search grids, each one is about a 120 square kilometers and that took us the course of a couple of months. It was about 26 days of searching.\\" The Indianapolis wreck is upright with her hull and armaments intact and well preserved in the depth. Her bow number 35 was seen by the ROV. Rusticles or oxidized wrought iron were found by the crew emerging from one of the main guns of the ship. = Surigao Strait = After discovering USS Indianapolis, Petrel sailed to Surigao City in October 2017 to participate in the 73rd commemoration of the Battle of Surigao Strait. In November 2017, after getting the nod from the Philippines' National Museum, Petrel surveyed Surigao Strait and discovered the wrecks of the Japanese battleships , , destroyers , , and . Each one was investigated by the ship's ROV and an onboard local historian confirmed the identity of the wreck. = Ormoc Bay and USS Ward = In December 2017, Petrel explored Ormoc Bay and discovered the wrecks of , , the , and what is believed to be two s. The discovery of the wreck of USS Ward was a central theme for the 76th commemoration of the Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December. Petrel expeditions in 2018 = Return to Ormoc Bay = In early January 2018, Petrel returned to Ormoc Bay and dived one of the Y≈´gumo-class destroyers found in 2017. Based on the guns and armament configuration, she was identified to be . The identification also validated the final resting places of the other ships of the lost Japanese convoy TA-4: the destroyers , and . The convoy was attacked by aircraft from Task Force 38 in the Battle of Ormoc Bay. Petrel and Octopus also dove their manned submersible Pagoo on USS Cooper. = C-2A Greyhound in the Philippine Sea = In February 2018, Petrel, with a US Navy team aboard, located and mapped the wreckage of a C-2A Greyhound aircraft that crashed into the Philippine Sea en route to on 22 November 2017. = USS Lexington in the Coral Sea = On 4 March 2018, Petrel explored the Coral Sea and discovered the wreck of the aircraft carrier , which sank during the Battle of the Coral Sea. = USS Juneau = On 17 March 2018, Petrel located the wreck of the antiaircraft light cruiser .

Petrels crew devised a close-up camera to view details inside the torpedo tube and engine telegraph. This exploration published on 23 April 2018, was supervised by Find AE1 Ltd in partnership with the Australian National Maritime Museum, the Royal Australian Navy, Curtin University, the Western Australian Museum, and the Submarine Institute of Australia. The approval for the survey was granted by Papua New Guinea National Museum and Art Gallery.  Petrel expeditions in 2019  = Niizuki = Petrel found the wreck of the wreck upright in of water in January 2019. While the wreck was heavily damaged, her mast is still attached and complete. The find of Niizuki was noteworthy because she was credited for sinking with the longest torpedo shot ever, with estimates ranging from . Niizukis discovery is also noteworthy as the photos of the wreck are the first photos of the ship to exist; no photos of her in service are known to have been taken. = Jints≈´ = In February 2019, the 's wreckage was discovered by Petrel near the mouth of Kula Gulf in the Solomon Islands. The broken cruiser rests in of water. Her bow section is lying on its port side and the stern section is upright. = Hiei = On 6 February 2019, the discovery of the was announced, the first Japanese battleship sunk in World War II. According to Petrel, Hiei now lies upside down in of water northwest of Savo Island in the Solomon Islands. Hiei is the fourth Japanese battleship found by Petrels crew. The was found in March 2015, and the s and were found in November 2017. Petrel was also able to survey another , , in a separate mission. Lead researcher Paul Mayer said that Hiei lies away from Kirishima. =USS Hornet= On 12 February 2019, the crew announced they had located the wreck of the aircraft carrier at a depth of more than off the Solomon Islands. She is in remarkably good condition. She sits right-side up with her island still in place. A portion of her flight deck has collapsed due to the fire that raged on her decks during the battle. A portion of her stern is torn away, but the hull remains mostly intact. Several aircraft are scattered among the wreck. =USS Strong= On 26 February 2019, the crew announced they had located the wreck of the destroyer , resting at a depth of . She rests in pieces, the largest of which is the heavily damaged forward section of the ship laying on its port side. The rest of the ship was largely fragmented by the detonation of her depth charges and lies in a compact debris field that includes the ship's boilers, propellers, and wheelhouse.https://www.facebook.com/rvpetrel/videos/368327814005027/?f=AbqfsxM3nkY5jdqQSVeO- NpY9RmwAsyIN1hfCmvkFX- _L_VXzskB8iwWqT435W2SsExQn2CtUGKZDikvRI9MIyn_uCp79vSbaKdG5o7F0HI5tg1ePHNk5kh8EylXJ1WTq5I&filters;=eyJycF9hdXRob3IiOiJ7XCJuYW1lXCI6XCJteV9ncm91cHNfYW5kX3BhZ2VzX3Bvc3RzXCIsXCJhcmdzXCI6XCJcIn0ifQ%3D%3D&epa;=SEE_MORE =USS Wasp= On 13 March 2019, the crew announced they had located the wreck of the aircraft carrier, resting at a depth of . The ship sits upright, though appears to have broken in two places, just forward and just aft of the island, apparently on impact with the seabed. The island itself is still in place, though the funnel structure was ripped off during the sinking. Several aircraft were also found in the debris field, including Dauntlesses and Avengers.https://www.facebook.com/rvpetrel/videos/268156990763206/ = Furutaka = On 4 May 2019, the crew announced they had located the wreck of the Japanese heavy cruiser at a depth of .

She is mostly intact, with the exception of her forward bow, which broke off and is lying upside down just astern of the rest of the ship. Her bridge and guns are also intact. She lies in of water. =Mogami= On 9 September 2019, it was announced that the wreck of the had been found in the Bohol Sea. She lies mostly intact, with the exception of her forward bow, which has been blown off, but lying nearby. She sits straight side up at a depth of . =USS St. Lo= On 10 October 2019, it was announced that the wreck of the escort carrier, , the first ship to have been sunk by a kamikaze, had been discovered on 25 May. She lies at a depth of on the edge of the Philippine Trench off the coast of Samar. She sits upright relatively intact, with notable battle damage. She is the first escort carrier to have been found. =Kaga= On 18 October 2019, Petrel announced they had discovered the wreck of the , off the coast of Midway Atoll. She lies straight side up, but with heavy battle damage, below the surface. She is the first Japanese aircraft carrier to have been found. = Akagi = On 20 October 2019, the director of undersea operations Rob Kraft and Naval History and Heritage Command historian Frank Thompson aboard Petrel identified the wreck of the using high-frequency sonar. Located north west of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, Akagi was found at a depth of . It is reported that the wreck is upright, on its keel and is largely intact. Due to damage sustained by the ROV during recovery from the preceding survey of Kaga, and a number of other factors, Petrel was unable to conduct a photographic survey of Akagi.https://www.facebook.com/rvpetrel/posts/2669615386407259?__xts__[0]=68.ARCVkS5bgVyTHTmKFZYZk_S3aSc9lz7wHo71hwgAgbY5cbxVIbhfDGULNggWlWrcOnBujTMB6H35FGzqQMa5cg97ji1rQ1bEvV6fiA8mA13-rgb7tqiZ5cRSISIgsWdHcGInZjbtJqG1PeXwFYcznr69ISCO6oAQLxWPWxce0nsWnsBp29Gj- Ozf6HP0ZU7ZmtLSQv2UPHbeQEs9LTabqCovB8CHQAuovacsgdyPXphycUkUIpGlVd8CXcL7g2IXdhi- aYeQyb- TV_egUs5v8YouMi5SOfOSD7QPj1dV9DbpdZ8lIfe0xVCBPje_VpYIhn9GGYvGrUGVtsck688wvI8A&__tn__=-R =Ch≈çkai= On 26 October 2019, the search team announced they had discovered, on 5 May earlier in the year, the wreck of the on the edge of the Philippine Deep. She lies upright with her bow section torn off, deep. =USS Johnston= On 30 October 2019, it was announced that the wreckage of a destroyer believed to be was located. It is believed to be the deepest ever located shipwreck at deep. =MV Do√±a Paz and MT Vector= On 19 December 2019, it was announced that Petrel had located and surveyed the wrecks of the Philippine ferry, and the oil tanker . Both wrecks were found apart at a depth of in the Sibuyan Sea. Both wrecks sit straight side up and are in good condition. =University of Hawaii's lost ROV Luukai= On 24 December 2019, news came out that Petrel and a team from University of Hawaii School of Ocean and Earth Sciences and Technology (UH-SOEST) located and successfully recovered the latter's lost ROV named Luukai north of Oahu at a depth of . The drone had broken its tether and was lost on the ocean floor on 20 July 2019. To retrieve Luukai, the team lowered a lift elevator and Petrels ROV worked on the recovery procedure. Luukai was recovered by the joint team on 29 August 2019. Petrel expeditions in 2020  =Deep Argo floats in the Atlantic Ocean= After finding Kaga and Akagi, Petrel crossed the Pacific in the fourth quarter of 2019 and stationed in the Atlantic Ocean to launch Deep Argo floats beginning January 2020. Through several weeks in January 2020, in the Brazil Basin of the Atlantic, Petrel and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) deployed a number of standard Navis floats (2000-m profiles), and deep SOLO floats (6000-m profiles). As part of the Deep Argo project, a multiyear partnership between the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (NOAA PMEL) and the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, the project aimed for a final deployment of Deep Argo floats aboard Petrel. Thousands of these floats are freely drifting around the globe to measure the temperature, salinity, and turbidity of the upper ocean, at depths down to and deeper to . The Foundation committed $4 million to NOAA to help implement the Deep Argo effort. = Full ocean multi-beam and sub bottom-profiler = In June 2020, Petrel had a Kongsberg EM124 1¬∞x2¬∞ full ocean MBES installed. A sub-bottom profiler, a Kongsberg SBP 29 6¬∞ system, was also installed on the ship. Both were tested in the Atlantic Ocean, giving detailed bathymetry readings from depths. = Long-term moorage = On 11 June 2020, Petrel announced on its Facebook page that it was going to be moored indefinitely. The announcement read, \\"The impact of the COVID-19 crisis has changed the world for the long term in ways that we never could have imagined. As a result of operational challenges from the pandemic, R/V Petrel will be placed into long-term moorage and she will not be deployed for the foreseeable future. We were tasked with a monumental mission ‚Äì discover, educate, and honor ‚Äì and we‚Äôre hopeful we will eventually be back in service.\\" Robert Kraft, subsea sirector, said, \\"I am proud of the successful Petrel missions that have brought information and closure to so many families and friends of WWII heroes. I am hopeful that Petrel will eventually be back in service, supporting the collection of ocean data and science.\\" Petrel, after her drydock in Florida, set sail for her final destination Leith, Scotland, on 16 August 2020. She arrived in Leith on 3 September 2020. She currently remains in port.

For example, agents are often assumed to have perfect information, and markets are often assumed to clear without friction. Or, the model may omit issues that are important to the question being considered, such as externalities. Any analysis of the results of an economic model must therefore consider the extent to which these results may be compromised by inaccuracies in these assumptions, and there is a growing literature debunking economics and economic models.  Restrictive, unrealistic assumptions  Provably unrealistic assumptions are pervasive in neoclassical economic theory (also called the \\"standard theory\\" or \\"neoclassical paradigm\\"), and those assumptions are inherited by simplified models for that theory. (Any model based on a flawed theory, cannot transcend the limitations of that theory.) Joseph Stiglitz' 2001 Nobel Prize lecture reviews his work on information asymmetries,Joseph E. Stiglitz. 2001 Nobel Prize lecture: which contrasts with the assumption, in standard models, of \\"perfect information\\". Stiglitz surveys many aspects of these faulty standard models, and the faulty policy implications and recommendations that arise from their unrealistic assumptions. Economic models can be such powerful tools in understanding some economic relationships that it is easy to ignore their limitations. One tangible example where the limits of economic models allegedly collided with reality, but were nevertheless accepted as \\"evidence\\" in public policy debates, involved models to simulate the effects of NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. James Stanford published his examination of 10 of these models.James Stanford. \\"Continental Economic Integration: Modeling the Impact on Labor,\\" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Mar 1993, V526 pp. 92‚Äì110James Stanford. 1993. The fundamental issue is circular reasoning: embedding one's assumptions as foundational \\"input\\" axioms in a model, then proceeding to \\"prove\\" that, indeed, the model's \\"output\\" supports the validity of those assumptions. Such a model is consistent with similar models that have adopted those same assumptions. But is it consistent with reality? As with any scientific theory, empirical validation is needed, if we are to have any confidence in its predictive ability. If those assumptions are, in fact, fundamental aspects of empirical reality, then the model's output will correctly describe reality (if it is properly \\"tuned\\", and if it is not missing any crucial assumptions). But if those assumptions are not valid for the particular aspect of reality one attempts to simulate, then it becomes a case of \\"GIGO\\" ‚Äì Garbage In, Garbage Out\\". James Stanford outlines this issue for the specific Computable General Equilibrium (\\"CGE\\") models that were introduced as evidence into the public policy debate, by advocates for NAFTA.Rick Crawford. 1996. in \\"Invisible Crises: What Conglomerate Control of Media Means for America and the World\\". Ed. Herbert Schiller, Hamid Mowlana, George Gerbner. Westview. 1996. Free, authorized version viewable at: Despite the prominence of Stiglitz' 2001 Nobel prize lecture, the use of arguably misleading neoclassical models persisted in 2007, according to these authors: The working paper, \\"Debunking the Myths of Computable General Equilibrium Models\\", SCEPA Working Paper 01-2008. provides both a history, and a readable theoretical analysis of what CGE models are, and are not. In particular, despite their name, CGE models use neither the Walrass general equilibrium, nor the Arrow-Debreus General Equilibrium frameworks. Thus, CGE models are highly distorted simplifications of theoretical frameworks‚Äîcollectively called \\"the neoclassical economic paradigm\\"‚Äîwhich‚Äîthemselves‚Äîwere largely discredited by Joseph Stiglitz. In the \\"Concluding Remarks\\" (p. 524) of his 2001 Nobel Prize lecture, Stiglitz examined why the neoclassical paradigm‚Äîand models based on it‚Äîpersists, despite his publication, over a decade earlier, of some of his seminal results showing that Information Asymmetries invalidated core Assumptions of that paradigm and its models: In the aftermath of the 2007‚Äì2009 global economic meltdown, the profession's alleged attachment to unrealistic models is increasingly being questioned and criticized. After a weeklong workshop, one group of economists released a paper highly critical of their own profession's allegedly unethical use of unrealistic models. Their Abstract offers an indictment of fundamental practices.  Omitted details  A great danger inherent in the simplification required to fit the entire economy into a model is omitting critical elements. Some economists believe that making the model as simple as possible is an art form, but the details left out are often contentious. For instance: * Market models often exclude externalities such as pollution. Such models are the basis for many environmentalist attacks on mainstream economists. It is said that if the social costs of externalities were included in the models their conclusions would be very different, and models are often accused of leaving out these terms because of economist's pro-free market bias. * In turn, environmental economics has been accused of omitting key financial considerations from its models. For example, the returns to solar power investments are sometimes modelled without a discount factor, so that the present utility of solar energy delivered in a century's time is precisely equal to gas-power station energy today. * Financial models can be oversimplified by relying on historically unprecedented arbitrage-free markets, probably underestimating the chance of crises, and under-pricing or under-planning for risk. *It is possible that any missing variable as well as errors in values of included variables can lead to erroneous results. * Model risk: There is a significant amount of model risk inherent in the current mathematical modeling approaches to economics that one must take into account when using them. A good economic theory should be built on sound economic principles tested on many free markets, and proven to be valid. However, empirical facts have been alleged to indicate that the principles of economics hold only under very limited conditions that are rarely met in real life, and there is no scientific testing methodology available to validate hypotheses. Decisions based on economic theories that are not scientifically possible to test can give people a false sense of precision, and that could be misleading, leading to build up logical errors. *Natural economics: Economics is concerned with both 'normal' and 'abnormal' economic conditions. In an objective scientific study one is not restricted by the normality assumption in describing actual economies, as much empirical evidence shows that some \\"anomalous\\" behavior can persist for a long time in real markets e.g., in market \\"bubbles\\" and market \\"herding\\".

It then sells the hand-stitched cushions, quilts and giftware in its online store and through supporter events around the country. Since 2018 the charity has also provided apprenticeships in textiles and mentoring programmes for ex-offenders at a workshop in south London. History Fine Cell Work was founded in 1997 by Lady Anne Tree (1927‚Äì2010), established by founding director Katy Emck OBE and is now run by its present managing director, Victoria Gillies, and a staff of fourteen. Prior to the foundation of the charity, prisoners were unable to receive payment for cell work in the United Kingdom, for which the charity founder, Lady Anne Tree campaigned extensively. In 1992 the law was changed enabling payment to be made to prisoners and Fine Cell Work was founded five years later. Patrons of the charity include Libby Purves, Dame Judi Dench and The Lord Ramsbotham, former Chief Inspector of Prisons. Operations Drapers‚Äô Hall, London Fine Cell Work operates in 32 British prisons and engages with 550 prisoners a year. This workforce is mostly made up of male prisoners, estimated at 96% male across 32 British prisons. It has the largest workforce of hand stitchers in Europe, working with 270 prisoners at any one time. The stitchers are able to do a level 2 qualification and save money for their release. There is also an external workshop where FCW graduates can do work experience and be employed in textiles production, sales and stock roles. Detail from Magna Carta (An Embroidery) (2015), designed by Cornelia Parker, and stitched in large part by members of Fine Cell Work Prisoners receive a small payment for the needlework, estimated to be an average of 24 hours of cell work per person per week. In 2016 the approximate combined total earned by the workforce across all prisons was ¬£75,000. The items are then sold online on the charity's website and in exclusive designer shops. Items typically include cushions and Christmas decorations. Following a grant from the National Lottery, Fine Cell Work set up a training workshop in London to help ex- offenders develop skills and further qualifications on release from prison. Needleworkers are given an apprenticeship in all aspects of textile production and distribution and work closely with experienced mentors. The programme is known as Open the Gate and takes place at the charity's hub in south London. Collaborations Fine Cell Work has collaborated with a wide variety of designers including Cath Kidston, Cressida Bell, Ben Pentreath, William Yeoward, Margo Selby and Kit Kemp. The products have been sold in the V&A;, Conran and Tate Modern shops. Major works have also been commissioned by the V&A; for its 2010 exhibition of British Quilts, and by artists including Cornelia Parker and Gavin Turk.

It was disbanded in 1995 as a result of the introduction of the more modern S-300PS in the Leningrad air defense system.  History  In the summer and fall of 1956, the 555th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment was formed as part of the Soviet Air Defense Forces from the 86th Separate Anti- Aircraft Artillery Battalion, a Soviet Army unit transferred from the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, previously stationed in Dresden. The new regiment was stationed in the village of Veretye near Ostrov. In 1960, the regiment was split into the 406th and 555th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiments. The former was transferred to Petrozavodsk and then to Novaya Zemlya. Both units were equipped with S-75 Dvina surface-to-air missiles. By the end of the year, the 555th included four S-75 battalions with its headquarters at Tishino (Ostrov-2). The regiment was part of the 6th Independent Air Defense Army.

Early life and education  Roni Ben Ari was born 1947 in Ramat Gan to Miriam and Abraham Halpern, a textile industrialist (Halpern Textile Industries). She lives in Moshav Netaim, with her husband, Daniel Ben Ari. They have three daughters. Ben Ari is a graduate of the Beit Berl Academic College, the School of Journalism in Tel Aviv, and the College for Geographic Photography.  Early career  She worked as a news director and reporter at the Israel Broadcasting Authority, Educational Television, and Channel Two. In recent years she has been working as an independent photographer. Her work has been exhibited in solo and in group exhibitions in Israel and around the world and it can be found in museums as well as in private collections. Among the subjects Ben Ari has investigated is the Israeli heroine. Mira Ben Ari‚Äîan exemplary figure who became the symbol of the Women's Corp of the Israel Defense Forces and for women in general‚Äîwho was killed in the battle of Kibbutz Nitzanim during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. The educational and heritage center at the Memorial to the Female Soldier, (located in old Nitzanim), was established in tribute to her spirit and legacy. Ben Ari is a founder and partner in the Bateva School educational program, a growing mainstreaming program that prepares children and youth with complicated learning disabilities for independent integration into society. She is also a shareholder in the Elyakim Ben Ari Company, a civil engineering company that executes national projects in Israel.  Artistic career  Ben Ari uses her photography to document social issues such as aging, homelessness, prostitution, minorities, and ecology. She mainly photographs people, but also their surrounding environment. Before she photographs them, Ben Ari first becomes close to her subjects by living with them. For example, the photographs for her project, Journey in Search of \\"»öigancƒÉ\\", were taken only after she had been living among the Romani for about a year. She began the project after the death of her mother who was born in Cluj-Napoka, Romania, a city that has historically had a large gypsy minority. In the project Till Their Voices Stop, Ben Ari lived in a nursing home.

It is also known by the Maori names Waitaha gecko and Moko-pƒÅpƒÅ, and as the Brown gecko. They were earlier placed in a different genus and called Hoplodactylus brunneus before further study split the genus Hoplodactylus into six genera, with some groups close to the former Hoplodactylus maculatus ‚ÄúCanterbury‚Äù being assigned to the new genus Woodworthia. The forms are separated geographically but have evolved from a common ancestor. Woodworthia geckos belong to the subfamily Diplodactylidae, known to be a primitive group found only in Australia, New Caledonia and New Zealand. The significant differences between New Zealand and Australian Diplodactylids may suggest that geckos have been in New Zealand since it broke away from the Gondwana supercontinent 85 million years ago. They are usually brown and highly patterned, including striped morphs. The eye colour ranges from green, brown to bright yellow and they can occur over a variety of habitats including dune-lands, forests, shrublands, river terraces and bluffs. It is endemic to New Zealand.  Species description and identification  Geckos are specialised lizards, with large eyes that are permanently open, and large fleshy tongues that are used to clean the eyes and scales of the lips. They have ‚Äúbroad scale-like plates on the lower surfaces of their toes which employ millions of microscopic setae (hair-like structures), each with an attracting magnetic force‚Äù that gives adhesion to smooth surfaces. Woodworthia gecko species are often darker in colour than other New Zealand gecko species. Woodworthia cf. brunnea geckos are usually brown, grey or olive with pale bands, blotches or stripes that are bright, and large blackish patches (often on the intact tail). The eye colour varies from green to brown to bright yellow and they usually have a narrow or broad pale stripe running from eye to nostril. The rostral scale contacts or virtually touches the nostril. Their undersides are usually pale and uniform in colour, although a few individuals have been observed with spotted bellies. They have pink mouths with a pink tongue that is tipped with grey. It has been observed that specimens from coastal dune habitats are smaller than those from forest/rocky habitats, measuring around 53‚Äì68mm between snout and vent, as opposed to 53‚Äì80mm. Their tail length is usually the same as snout-vent length when intact. Woodworthia cf. brunnea gecko toes have ‚Äú9-12 lamellae‚Äù and straight distal phalanges, while the soles of their feet are usually light grey. They can be highly variable in colour and patterning which may explain the difficulties in classifying them as their own species in earlier years.  Geographic distribution and habitat  Natural global range ‚Äì Woodworthia cf. brunnea geckos are an endemic species; they occur naturally only in the South Island of New Zealand. The New Zealand Department of Conservation has them listed as ‚Äúbio status  Indigenous (Endemic)‚Äù, with a New Zealand threat classification of declining. New Zealand range ‚Äì These geckos are found in the South Island of New Zealand, from southern Marlborough to mid-Canterbury and the Banks Peninsula. They are also found inland in the Canterbury plains and on coastal hills south to around the Rakaia River. They have been observed on Kaitorete spit in their smaller dune-land size. Around the Banks Peninsula and the Port Hills, they are locally abundant but have been lost in many parts of the Canterbury plains due to habitat loss/land use change. The Canterbury gecko has a range of habitat preferences primarily in lowland areas which include trees in forests as they retreat to sites beneath loose bark or in deep hallows especially in standing dead trees. They also live in creviced rock outcrops, rock tumbles, bluffs and associated scrubby vegetation as well as dune lands among driftwood, scrub, rocks and pohuehue, and along coastlines, especially Birdlings Flat/Kaitorete Spit. The climate around the Banks Peninsula consists of an average rainfall of around 969mm per year, as the rainfall in New Zealand varies quite a bit we can see that the geckos prefer the East Coast compared to the West Coast as it is a lot drier on the East. The average temperature ranges from a high of 23 degrees to a low of 4 degrees in summer and a high of 13 degrees to a low of 2 degrees in winter. Canterbury has around 2100‚Äì2300 hours of sunshine annually. The Canterbury gecko exhibits high site fidelity and has very small home range. They have also adapted to widespread habitat modifications and can be seen in shelterbelts and other wild areas in the agricultural landscape. Canterbury Plains Woodworthia cf. brunnea geckos are a generalist/facultative species, as they inhabit the coastal, lowland, and montane/subalpine regions of the South Island, in a wide variety of habitats. They are restricted below the tree line in most areas. On predator-free islands, they have been found inhabiting seabird burrows and can be found frequently in modified environments such as inorganic debris and buildings, close to human habitation. Small-leaved coprosmas are a favourite of New Zealand lizard species, as they offer a protective habitat in their tangled branches. Pohuehue (Muehlenbeckia complexa) is another favourite, as many invertebrates are found on it, and the fruit is ideal for lizards.  Life cycle/phenology  Among New Zealand species of geckos and skinks, females will typically mate and begin vitellogenesis in autumn, storing the sperm over winter and ovulating in the spring. The pregnancy usually lasts around three months, although gestation length may reach 14 months as it is temperature dependent. This quality is especially the case for nocturnally foraging species such as the Woodworthia cf. brunnea. Cree & Hare state in ‚ÄòNew Zealand Lizards‚Äô that ‚Äúmale geckos and skinks exhibit spermiogenesis during summer and/or autumn, with prolonged or continuous spermatocytogenesis and no period of complete testicular regression.‚Äù Lizards in cool climates in South America and Tasmania exhibit similar features to the New Zealand species, such as ‚Äúautumn mating with prolonged vitellogenesis, [the] possibility of a secondary mating season in spring, prolonged pregnancies with sometimes less-than-annual reproduction in females‚Äù. Native geckos (and skinks) reach sexual maturity and start to reproduce around three years of age, with variations according to species and condition. The main determining factor in the ability to mate appears to be size. There have been cases of geckos in captivity that have mated and produced viable progeny at two years of age, although their first birth is often one hatchling rather than the norm of two. Woodworthia cf. brunnea geckos are primarily nocturnal but have been known to sun bake at the entrance to their retreats. They often form large social aggregations, especially in areas without predators where they are abundant in numbers. Woodworthia cf. brunnea is known to have the highest recorded longevity of any New Zealand gecko species, at 53 years of age in the wild. Young are born in late February to March, with females often giving birth to a maximum litter of two. They are viviparous, meaning the eggs hatch in the female's oviduct before the young are born - ‚ÄúVivipary is thought to be an adaptation to New Zealand‚Äôs cooling climate during the ice ages ‚Äì most other viviparous lizards occur in colder regions of the world‚Äù. They mate once a year, usually in spring or summer. ‚ÄúGeckos are very responsive to the influence of temperature and in cooler climates will draw out the reproductive cycle‚Äù, with females sometimes producing a litter every second or third year instead of every year. They are thermoregulators, basking in the sun either directly or through a thin cover object, and many New Zealand geckos and frogs can lighten or darken their colouration to enable the absorption of thermal energy.  Diet  Harakeke (flax) and mingimingi (Coprosma propinqua) Canterbury gecko are omnivores and mainly eat small invertebrates such as moths and flies, fruit, in particular from the Coprosma spp. and some nectar from flowers. Southern rƒÅtƒÅ (Metrosideros umbellƒÅtƒÅ) Most New Zealand native lizard species are omnivorous, eating a range of arthropods and sometimes other lizards and berries, or even nectar and pollen from flowers. Woodworthia cf. brunnea geckos are primarily insectivores (e.g. eating moths and flies) but will also feed on fruit (berries). New Zealand gecko species are known to drink nectar from many native plants such as cabbage trees, flax, southern rƒÅtƒÅ and p≈çhutukawa, and likely play a minor role in the pollination of these species too. Divaricating plant species such as mingimingi (Coprosma propinqua) produce small black/blue berries that are a favourite of lizards. In the paper ‚ÄòThe role of lizards as seed dispersers in New Zealand‚Äô it was suggested that New Zealand lizards are ‚Äúeffective dispersers, and white-blue fruits and divaricating shrubs are adapted to lizard dispersal‚Äù. They found that lizards eat the fruits of around 23 native species, of which five are divaricating, and favour white-blue fruits to red, even though these are less present in the flora. White-blue fruits are often found in open habitats, which can be near the rocky habitat of the Woodworthia cf. brunnea. It was also discovered that ‚ÄúSeeds in lizard scats have germination percentages‚â§control seeds in four species tested. Lizards generally disperse seeds < 20 m, but allow seeds to escape parent plants and reach safe establishment sites.‚Äù They concluded that lizards may be important seed dispersers even at their low numbers on the mainland, and potentially assist in the dispersal of more seeds than previously imagined: ‚ÄúIn shrublands lacking frugivorous birds, lizards may be the only remaining dispersers‚Äù. Lizard species vary their behaviour according to weather or habitat opportunities: when it is cold, they may remain inactive or employ the ‚Äúsit and wait‚Äù method for food, and in warmer weather, they may roam their habitats in search of food. Hare, Pledger, Thompson, Miller, & Daugherty studied the metabolic rate of nocturnal Diplodactylidae species in New Zealand emerging for either foraging or thermoregulating through most of the day and found that ‚Äútheir Vo2 [rate of oxygen consumption] is usually elevated only during the active (foraging) phase. ÃáThus, many nocturnal lizards are active at suboptimal temperatures and emergent and thermoregulating when their metabolic rate is low.‚Äù Although it was noted that as their metabolic rate would increase with the ‚Äúcorresponding increase in temperature from diurnal thermoregulation,‚Äù that the lower metabolic rate during the day may not be significant to their physiology.  Predator/prey  Weasels (left two) and stoats (right two) Canterbury geckos in the wild have been recorded as having low levels of red mites. All New Zealand geckos have two main threats which are predation and habitat destruction. The main predators of the Canterbury gecko include mammalian pests such as mice, rats, weasels, hedgehogs, cats, stoats, ferrets, pigs and possums. With the evolving suburban areas in Canterbury, the geckos are being pushed out of their natural habitat and with conversion by burning and ploughing, this is threatening geckos that live in rock outcrops. Introduced mammals represent one of the biggest threats to many of New Zealand's native species, including Woodworthia cf. brunnea. Birds and lizards filled the role of land mammals in New Zealand before the arrival of humans, and due to the absence of these predatory mammals, many species are somewhat na√Øve to the dangers of predators. Native lizards are predated on by cats, mustelids, possums, hedgehogs and rats (both the European rats and the Polynesian kiore). Some lizards on the mainland and smaller islands went extinct after the introduction of kiore, and many more after the arrival of the various European predators. The Department of Conservation has estimated that New Zealand's population of 1.4 million domestic cats kill ‚Äúat least 18.76 million animals a year, including 1.12 million native birds‚Äù. Polynesian rat (Kiore) Three species of New Zealand lizards have been declared extinct since human arrival, and a further eight survive only on outer islands where there are fewer predators. Nocturnal species such as the Woodworthia are more at threat than the diurnal gecko species, as mammalian predators often hunt at night. Many lizards occur only in small, separated populations today due to habitat loss and predation. Almost half of New Zealand's reptile species are listed as threatened or endangered, and it has been declared illegal to handle or keep any native lizard without a permit from DOC. Geckos do have some defence against predators, as they can release (autotomise) their tails at will. The tail is used as a distraction; it continues to move and distract the predator while the gecko escapes. As it takes a few years for the tail to regrow, it is not a method that can be used for every encounter. Larger reptiles and amphibians predate on smaller species, as will larger invertebrates such as centipedes and spiders. Birds such as owls, terns, rails and kingfishers will predate on geckos, as will blackbirds and magpies. Introduced predatory invertebrates such as ants, wasps and mantids have been known to predate some New Zealand lizard species. Brushtail possum Mites are common parasites of all lizard species in New Zealand, in the form of tiny red, orange or creamy white spots around the eyes, ears, armpits hind limbs and cloaca. Internal parasites include a range of nematodes and diseases such as Salmonella. Skrjabinodon poicilandri is a native nematode species known to infect only geckos. They are members of the family Oxyuroidea, and as such are ‚Äústrictly monoxenous (direct, one-host life cycle) with the egg being the infective stage‚Äù. The geckos are infected when they unintentionally consume the eggs. The study by Mockett et al. confirmed that the New Zealand gecko nematodes all belonged to the same genus, Skrjabinodon. Host phylogeny was found to significantly predict the parasite phylogeny, which indicates that cospeciation may have played a role in the evolution of New Zealand geckos and the associated Skrjabinodon, although it was acknowledged that host-switching to closely related host species would have played an important role. It was also noted that ‚Äúnot all host‚Äìparasite associations supported a congruent host‚Äìparasite phylogenetic history‚Äù.  New Zealand lizard history  New Zealand has 99 native lizard taxa (including undescribed entities), all of which belong to genera that are endemic to the country. They are also globally significant in that they have a high level of adaptation to cold-climate living. Most lizard species bear live young, which is unusual as the majority of lizards around the world lay eggs. This adaptation enables the mother lizard to select the best available temperature for the developing young, by either sun basking or moving into a deep retreat. These lizards also exhibit extreme longevity, living to 40 or more years. This lengthy lifespan arises from ‚Äúan existence in relative slow motion at cool temperatures‚Äù, and in alpine zones a long period of hibernation. In comparison, many lizard species in other parts of the world live only 5‚Äì10 years. Jewell states that ‚Äúthis same effect also works to expand gestation (pregnancy) and growth rates to novel degrees‚Äù. New Zealand's lizards also inhabit a range of harsh environments, such as alpine areas that are covered in snow for much of the year, and coastal areas pounded by waves. New Zealand lizard species are thought to have been present for at least 40 million years, with older species such as the tuatara and amphibian species present for around 80 million years.  Other information  Pitfall trap Geckos can vocalise, and many New Zealand species make a chirping sound, while some green geckos produce a sound much like a ‚Äòbark‚Äô. They are found on both the mainland and the offshore islands, at a wide range of altitudes (from sea level to c. 2200m), and in many different habitats. Systematic searching and pitfall trapping are the primary methods for monitoring lizards species, but Tony Whitaker (1967) would locate nocturnal species such as Woodworthia cf. brunnea by ‚Äòeye-shine‚Äô- ‚Äúcreated when light from a torch beam is reflected from the tapetum lucidum (a layer of tissue in the eye)‚Äù. The testing of this technique enabled him to develop a binocular-mounted spotlight with a controllable light source, which could locate geckos over distances of 10‚Äì100m. This equipment proved invaluable when surveying difficult to search terrain and in areas with low population densities and/or ‚Äúcryptic‚Äù species. Tracking tunnels are a potential monitoring method, as Jarvie & Monks ‚Äúobtained relatively clear, measurable prints for all gecko species‚Äù in their testing, and the findings suggested that footprints from tracking tunnels may be useful in distinguishing between gecko species, although additional research is needed to ‚Äúassess the ability to further discriminate intra- and inter-genera lizard footprints from tracking tunnels‚Äù. Ureia, guardian taniwha (sea creature), depicted in a carved poupou (house post) from the interior of Hotunui, a carved meeting house of the Ngati Maru people, Thames, New Zealand. In 2015, some Woodworthia cf. brunnea geckos were relocated into Riccarton Bush from the bluffs above RƒÅpaki, as due to the Christchurch earthquake their habitat was under threat. Two hundred and nine geckos were retrieved ‚Äúfrom the Crater Rim Bluffs by abseil access rope technicians because major geotechnical work planned for the area would destroy the geckos‚Äô habitat‚Äù. While it was noted that the forested habitat of the Bush was very different from their previous rocky bluff habitat, it was selected as the release area due to the predator-proof fence surrounding it, offering the geckos the best chance for survival. Canterbury geckos had lived in the Riccarton Bush area until around the 1980s, and as such it was determined they could survive there again. The geckos were fitted with radio transmitters and released into kahikatea trees (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides), although most moved to ‚Äúother vine-covered trees or stumps. One took up residence in a cabbage tree near the release tree‚Äù. The transmitters proved effective in monitoring the distance the geckos moved and whether they remained close enough together for further mating opportunities, and the geckos ‚Äúseem to have settled in well‚Äù. MƒÅori brought with them the traditional Polynesian names for reptiles and amphibians, ngƒÅrara is the general term for reptiles and moko or mokomoko for lizards, with other names such as moko pƒÅpƒÅ referring to ‚Äòtypes‚Äô or discrete species of reptiles. Reptiles have particular cultural and spiritual significance to MƒÅori as they are cited in many myths and legends, with ‚Äúlinks to death, demons and the after-world‚Äù. There can be much cultural superstition and fear surrounding ngƒÅrara, with green coloured gecko species being seen as a bad omen. Some iwi (tribes) see lizards as kaitiaki (guardians) of the dead, and lizards were often buried or placed near important structures such as wƒÅnanga (house of learning). In art such as carvings, petroglyphs, tattoos and pendants, reptiles are often pictured, but curiously, native frogs are not and have no feature in the myths and legends, even though MƒÅori would have encountered them in the landscape.

She is a social and personality psychologist who studies how self-perception and self-knowledge influence one's personality and behavior. Vazire was recipient of the American Psychological Association Award for Distinguished Scientific Early Career Contributions to Psychology in 2015 for \\"original contributions to understanding the limits of self-knowledge and the constraints on our knowledge of others.\\" Vazire was recognized as a rising star by the Association for Psychological Science. Her other awards include the SAGE Young Scholar Award (2011), and the Outstanding Early Career Award from the International Society for Self and Identity (2011). Vazire co-founded the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS), which aims to encourage open, reproducible science; she has served as chair of the SIPS executive committee and is a member of the senior editorial team of their journal Collabra: Psychology. Vazire is a member of the Board of Directors of the Association for Psychological Science (2016-2019) and is editor of the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science. With Timothy D. Wilson, Vazire co-edited the Handbook of Self-Knowledge, which reviews the state of the science on how people perceive their own personality traits, behaviors, thoughts, emotions, and relationships.  Biography  Born to an Iranian father, Vazire received her BA in psychology (minoring in women's studies) at Carleton College in 2000. https://twitter.com/siminevazire/status/825018099522949120She continued her education in taking a Ph.D in social and personality psychology program at the University of Texas at Austin, where she worked under the supervision of Samuel D. Gosling. Her dissertation titled The Person from the Inside and Outside was named University of Texas Outstanding Dissertation in the Social Sciences in 2006. Vazire joined the faculty of the Department of Psychology at Washington University in St. Louis in 2007, where she was appointed Saul and Louise Rosenzweig Chair in Personality Science. Vazire was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University (2013-2014). She subsequently moved to join the faculty of the Department of Psychology at University of California, Davis in 2014, where she directs the Personality and Self-Knowledge Lab. Her research on self-knowledge and the development of character has been supported by grants from National Science Foundation and the John Templeton Foundation.  Research  Simine Vazire is known for her research of self-knowledge in relation to personality and behavior, which examines topics such as how accurate people perceive themselves (identity) and how they are perceived by others (reputation) and self-other asymmetries in the accuracy of personality judgments. Vazire's self-other knowledge asymmetry model aims to establish the conditions under which self-knowledge is more or less accurate than the evaluations of others. According to her model, self-knowledge should be more accurate for traits that are low in observability, such as neuroticism, and less accurate for traits that are high in evaluativeness, such as intellectual ability.Vazire, S. (2010). Who knows what about a person? The self‚Äìother knowledge asymmetry (SOKA) model. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 98(2), 281-300. Vazire and her colleagues have examined narcissism in relation to other personality traits, such as impulsivity Several studies have relied on experience sampling methods, which Vazire learned as a student working with Matthias Mehl and James W. Pennebaker, the developers of the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR) methodology for sampling naturalistic daily activities and conversations. Her co-authored study with Nicholas Holtzman and Mehl, titled Sounds like a narcissist: Behavioral manifestations of narcissism in everyday life, was named the best paper of 2011 by the Journal of Research in Personality. Using EAR methodology, the researchers sampled naturalistic behavior of college students over four consecutive days and related their everyday behaviors to scores on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory and to other established measures of personality traits and self-esteem. The researchers found relationships between narcissism, as assessed using the traditional measures, and observed behaviors. Individuals who scored higher on narcissism displayed more extraverted and less agreeable behavior and were more likely to engage in sexual language use than other college students. Other collaborative studies have investigated whether users' profiles on online social networking sites provide accurate portrayals of their owners. Vazire and her colleagues argue against the view that users of social networking sites present altered and idealized depictions of themselves online that are not accurate reflections of their true \\"offline\\" personalities. Rather, they suggest that users tend to express themselves authentically in their efforts to communicate with others online. Users' social networking site profiles appear to be sufficient to allow others to gain an accurate sense of their personalities, especially for traits such as openness to experience.

Life  Gottfried Maria Kauffman was born in the fifteenth district of Vienna. His father was the noted Vienna organ builder, Johann M. Kauffmann (1910-1965). The Kauffmanns had indeed been active in Vienna as organ builders since 1877: between 1964 and 1968 G√∂tz Kauffmann also studied as an apprentice to master the craft. He then decided to pursue a career not as an organ builder but as an actor and cabaret artist. Kauffmann undertook his drama training at Vienna's Max Reinhardt Seminar where he completed the four-year course in 1972. Early theatre engagements took him to the Salzburger Landestheater and then, in 1977, to the Raimund Theater and the Theater in der Josefstadt in Vienna. He reached a wider audience through appearances in several long running television series such as \\"Ein echter Wiener geht nicht unter\\" (loosely \\"You can't knock a true Viennese down\\", 1975-1979) in which he featured as the concierge, \\"Kurt Blahovec\\". There were also \\"Mozart und Meisel\\" (1987), in which he played the leading part and \\"Kaiserm√ºhlen Blues\\" (1992-1999) in which he also took one of the lead roles. He was also becoming known in film roles, featuring in numerous national and international cinema productions. He played the part of Oskar in \\"Tales from the Vienna Woods\\" directed by Maximilian Schell and was a member of the cast of \\"Verlassen Sie bitte Ihren Mann!\\" (\\"Please leave your husband\\", 1993) directed by Reinhard Schwabenitzky, and starring Reinhard Schwabenitzky's grand daughter, Elfi Eschke, Wolfgang B√∂ck and Helmut Griem. More recently, in 2008, he appeared in \\"Echte Wiener ‚Äì Die Sackbauer-Saga\\" (2008), a successful cinema reprise of the 1970s television series. Alongside his film career Kauffman continued to sustain his career as a theatre performer, and also pursued his interest in cabaret. In 1980 he founded the \\"Arge Kabarett\\" and in 1983 he presented his first solo programme, \\"G√∂tz-Zitate\\". During his final years he worked as a freelance performer in Vienna, also reprising various lead roles in the Gloria-Theater. G√∂tz Kauffmann was honoured with the Goldener Rathausmann award by the city of Vienna. He was also a notable freemason. His strikingly confessional autobiography, \\"Meine Abrechnung. Zwischen Kaiserm√ºhlen-Blues und Suff\\", appeared in 1999. It disclosed a sometimes difficult life, featuring three broken marriages, depression and alcohol issues. For many years he was also badly affected by diabetes. A few days before he died Kauffmann was able to celebrate his sixty-first birthday, surrounded by colleagues, his three children and his brother. His body is buried in the family grave at the Baumgartner Cemetery (Group K1, Nr. 75) in Vienna. = Theatre roles (selection) = * 1970‚Äì1972: Die Zwillinge von Venedig, Bauernhof-Theater in Meggenhofen (O√ñ) * 1970‚Äì1972: Das Kaffeehaus von Carlo Goldoni, Bauernhof- Theater in Meggenhofen (O√ñ) * 1970‚Äì1972: Urfaust, Bauernhof-Theater in Meggenhofen (O√ñ) * 1972: Wie es Euch gef√§llt (Probstein), Landestheater Salzburg * 1972: Wiener Blut (Kagler), Landestheater Salzburg * 1972: Lumpazivagabundus (Knieriem), Landestheater Salzburg * 1978: Tscharlie der Kegel: Der uneheliche Sohn des Herrn Karl, one person piece by Herwig Seeb√∂ck, written for G√∂tz Kauffmann * 1978: Der tolle Tag oder die Hochzeit des Figaro, Salzburger Festspiele * 1979: Die Heirat, Volkstheater Wien * 1980: Die letzten Tag der Menschheit, Wiener Festwochen * 1981‚Äì1982: Professuren, Theater der Courage * 1981‚Äì1982: Mir san net aso, Theater in der Drachengasse * 1981‚Äì1982: Der Talisman, Theater in der Josefstadt * 1981‚Äì1982: Liliom, Theater in der Josefstadt * 1985‚Äì1986: Turnhalle, Theater in der Drachengasse * 1989: Das vierte Gebot, Sommerfestspiele Berndorf/Stadttheater * 1990: Haben Sie nichts zu verzollen, Theater in der Josefstadt * 1991: Orpheus in der Unterwelt, Wiener Kammeroper * 2005: Wiener Blut, Musik Theater Sch√∂nbrunn * 2007: Die Fledermaus, Musik Theater Sch√∂nbrunn = Film roles (selection) = * 1971: Tatort - Mordverdacht, at that times till identified as Gottfried Kauffmann * 1975‚Äì1979: Ein echter Wiener geht nicht unter * 1976: Die Alpensaga, Teil 1 ‚Äì Liebe im Dorf * 1977: Tatort ‚Äì Der vergessene Mord * 1977: Die Alpensaga, Teil 3 ‚Äì Das gro√üe Fest * 1978: Aus dem Leben eines Dicken * 1978: Singles * 1979: Tales from the Vienna Woods * 1980: Car-napping * 1981: Kottan ermittelt ‚Äì Die Bef√∂rderung * 1984: '''' * 1987: Mozart und Meisel * 1992‚Äì1999: Kaiserm√ºhlen Blues * 1993: Verlassen Sie bitte Ihren Mann! * 1993: Die Rebellion * 1995: Schwarze Tage * 1995: T√∂dliche Liebe * 1995: El Chicko ‚Äì der Verdacht * 1996: Der See * 1996: '''' * 1999: Fink f√§hrt ab * 2001‚Äì2002: Dolce Vita & Co * 2001: Ene mene muh ‚Äì und tot bist du * 2008: '''' = Cabaret (selection) = * 1977: Stichwort √ºber ‚Ä¶ * 1983: G√∂tz-Zitate (first solo programme) * 1987: Aber der Kopf is‚Äô no oben * 1988: Geschafft * 1988: Duell/Duett * 1988: Alles Theater * 1991: Mir stinkt‚Äôs * 1999: Tick Tak Talk * 1999: Warten auf die Talkshow = Books = * Meine Abrechnung.

It is part of the Andean Volcanic Belt, more specifically to its sub-belt the Central Volcanic Zone. The Central Volcanic Zone consists of about 44 active volcanoes and large calderas of the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex. Volcanism there is caused by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate in the Peru-Chile Trench. At Tocomar, volcanism is further influenced by a large fault zone, the Calama-Olacapato-El Toro fault, which runs diagonally across the volcanic arc. Tocomar has generated several pyroclastic flows during the Pleistocene as well as phreatic-phreatomagmatic activity, and a magma chamber may still exist beneath the volcano. Hot springs are found at the volcanic centre and have been prospected for the generation of geothermal power; the water discharged by the springs eventually forms the Tocomar river. Wetlands are found in the area. Other than this, Tocomar was used as a source of obsidian in antiquity and more recently as a candidate site for a gamma ray observatory and as a mine.  Geography and geomorphology  Tocomar lies in northwestern Argentina, away from the town of San Antonio de los Cobres in the Jujuy Province and in proximity to the border with the Salta Province farther south. The area is part of the Puna, a high plateau of the Andes which formed starting in the Eocene and whose margins are formed by the Eastern Cordillera and the volcanic Western Cordillera. The Salta-Antofagasta railway and pass close to the volcanic field. Tocomar is located at elevation within a northwestward draining valley. In this valley, pyroclastic flow and pyroclastic surge deposits crop out on the valley floor and parts of its slopes. In the northwestern and southeastern segments of the field, two vents can be recognized and are associated with springs. An obsidian lava dome marks one of the vents; aside from vents and dome the pyroclastic deposit forms most of this volcano. Hot springs are found at Tocomar and their activity has generated travertine deposits on the field, including at Ba√±os de Tocomar where silica and sulfur accumulations can be found. The temperature of the water is about and the waters are salty. Pits interpreted as having formed during hydrothermal explosions are also found. The springs are mostly found where the terrain has been incised by valleys. Electrical resistivity has been used to infer the structure of the geothermal reservoir beneath Tocomar, which is mostly located within a Paleozoic basement; the temperatures of the reservoir have been estimated to be at depth. The water appears to be precipitation water that infiltrates terrain south of Tocomar, at elevations of . After being heated by the deep geothermal system, the water seems to interact with another shallower aquifer before emerging in the springs. Tocomar has been investigated for the potential to generate geothermal power. However, exploration of the Tocomar-Cerro Tuzgle area ceased after a few wells were drilled and ended up being unproductive.  Geology  = Background = Tocomar is part of the Andean Volcanic Belt's Central Volcanic Zone, which runs along the western margin of South America and lies in the countries of Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina. The Central Volcanic Zone features about 44 active volcanoes as well as several large ignimbrite caldera systems; some of these are part of the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex. About 200 of all volcanoes in the Andes have been active during the Holocene, 66 of these in historical times. The date of the last eruption of Tocomar is not known with certainty but was in the Pleistocene. Aside from the regular volcanic arc, volcanoes aligned along west-northwest to east-southeast lineaments are also part of the Central Volcanic Zone. = Local = At Tocomar, the Calama- Olacapato-El Toro fault is subdivided into two subsidiary faults called Incachule and Chorrillos, which in turn are connected by a number of normal faults that give the whole are a complex faulting scheme. These normal faults are associated with the Tocomar vents, and deformation of the eruption deposits indicates that some of the faults were active just as eruptions occurred; it is likely that eruptions were triggered by movement along these faults. These faults also control where geothermal spring activity occurs, but whether the faults themselves were active in the Quaternary is unclear; microseismic activity is still ongoing. The Tocomar volcano was constructed atop the ignimbrites from the Aguas Calientes caldera, as well as Pleistocene sediments which display traces of earthquake activity and form an alluvial cone. The area is a former basin now filled with volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The oldest outcropping basement in the region is the Precambrian Puncoviscana Formation east of Tocomar, in the San Antonio de los Cobres ridge. Other volcanoes in the region are Cerro Tuzgle and two maars due north, Negro de Chorrillos and San J√©ronimo due east and the Aguas Calientes caldera due south; the last two are located fairly close to Tocomar. These volcanoes were active roughly in reverse order, with Aguas Calientes active between 11-10 million years ago, while the other centers are of Quaternary age. = Composition = The Tocomar centre has erupted rhyolitic ignimbrites, which belong to the potassium-rich peraluminous calc-alkaline magmatic series. It does not contain many crystals, which are formed by biotite, plagioclase and quartz.  Climate, hydrology and vegetation  The region is sunny, dry, windy, cold and has a high difference between daytime and nighttime temperature. Average precipitation is less than mostly during summer; consequently Tocomar has an arid climate. The region was warmer and even drier in the past during the early Holocene, but Tocomar was paradoxically wetter. Springs give source to several permanent rivers in the region, which flow in deep valleys. Among these rivers is the , which after originating in a wetland receives the water from the Tocomar geothermal field and eventually ends in the . Much of the area around Tocomar has no vegetation. Of the plants that grow in the region, vegetation in the Puna occurs in the form of grass and shrub steppe. Because of the dry climate, wetlands are highly important for the regional biota and feature a characteristic biota. They have a different flora; 25 species have been identified in the Tocomar wetland. Green algae form mats close to the warm springs, which are also colonized by blue-green algae. Among the animals of the area are camelids such as the guanaco and the vicu√±a, rodents like the chinchilla and viscacha, the cervid taruca, 20 species of birds including the iconic flamingos and the Andean toad Rhinella spinulosa, which lives in high altitude wetlands. Other animals found in the wetlands are amphipods such as Hyalella and leeches, among other aquatic macroinvertebrates. During the mid-Holocene dry period the wetlands of Tocomar may further have offered a refuge for local humans.  Eruptive history  Between 1,150,000 ¬± 300,000 and 550,000 ¬± 100,000, the \\"Tocomar ignimbrite\\" was emplaced in the area. It consists of several different units of pyroclastic material, which cover a surface of about . It is likely that geothermal activity was occurring at Tocomar prior to the emplacement of these ignimbrites; geothermally altered material was ejected during the eruptions. The eruption process has been reconstructed with the aid of the volcanic deposits. A first eruptive episode was phreatomagmatic and generated a low eruption column which in turn gave rise to pyroclastic flows and pyroclastic surges, which were heavily influenced by the topography as they propagated and then came to rest, giving rise to several geological units which are each thick. These units include a lithic unit formed by pre-existent country rock which overlies other units and is sometimes embedded into them as lens-like forms, and a pumice fall deposit that has undergone hydrothermal alteration and fluvial erosion in part. At least three lapilli tuff units are present, the thickest of which has a massive structure and reaches a thickness of . An obsidian containing facies is found inside of one vent of the volcano. In addition to these three primary lapilli tuff units, a secondary unit is exposed in some parts of the volcano and was emplaced during a later stage of volcanic activity. The secondary unit is about thick and consists of blocks embedded within a matrix formed by lapilli. This second eruption was phreatic and took place a while after the first one; it was probably caused by the interaction of rhyolitic magma with the old geothermal system, and triggered by movement along the local faults. Gravimetric anomalies, the presence of magmatic water in the springs and their high temperatures of about indicate that a magma chamber still exists beneath Tocomar.  Human use  Indigenous people of the region obtained obsidian at Tocomar and other sites of the region. Tocomar itself was not a major obsidian source however; other sites in the region were far more important. In modern times, Tocomar has been investigated as a candidate site for a gamma ray observatory in Argentina. The existence of a kaolin mine in the area was reported in 1993.

The cult is found mainly among the local Mang'anja people and its former extent reflected that people's wider past distribution. It aims to secure abundant rains at the appropriate season through the making of propitiatory gifts at cult shrines, and includes rainmaking rituals in the event of drought. It has been related to a number of other territorial cults among the Maravi cluster of related African peoples which aim to secure the well-being of the people of a particular area secure from drought, floods or food shortages. The cult is believed to be a long established one, although estimates of how long it has existed are speculative, as the earliest definite record of its existence dates from 1862. There are a number of debates about the sect. The first is what the essential nature of M'Bona is, whether a natural spirit, a deified single human or combination of several such people, a priest or other human intermediary with a god or even the personification of the suffering of the conquered people, whether this identity has changed over time, and whether the name M'Bona has been applied to what were originally different entities in different places. The second is whether the current stories about M'Bona are myths, created to explain the cult after it was formed, oral traditions with possibly a much distorted factual basis or a form of oral history from which actual past events can be recovered. The third is about the exact historical role of the M'Bona cult and whether its ritual practices as recorded in the 20th centuries are a continuation of those of earlier times. Much of the study of M'Bona was undertaken by Father Jan Matthew Schoffeleers (1928 ‚Äì 2011), an anthropologist and researcher into African Religion, who was a Catholic missionary in the Lower Shire valley from 1955 to 1963 and then followed a largely academic career in Britain, Malawi and the Netherlands until his retirement in 1998. His extensive study of the cult began in the 1950s and he published eight books or papers on it between 1972 and 1992, besides two academic theses.van Binsbergen (2011), pp. 456, 462-3 Historical background =From early sources= A number of speculative reconstructions of the origin of the Maravi cluster of peoples suggest that they entered the area of central and southern Malawi in relatively small groups from the 14th century, and that the trade in ivory they developed with the Muslim traders based on the coast of Nampula and Zambezia provinces was central to the rise of centralised Maravi states in the late 16th and 17th centuries in an area they had long occupied. The later conflicts between these states. The political changes in the area between 1570 and 1640 were said to result from the disruption of that trade by the Portuguese, who had been excluded from that trade, and their African allies.Alpers (1975), pp. 46-9, 53 However, there is no documentary evidence for a Maravi movement into the Lower Zambezi and Lower Shire river valleys before the late 16th century, let alone their forming organised states in that area before the 1570s, or for any substantial ivory trade between that area and the coastal Muslims.Newitt (1982), pp. 147-8 The earliest European account of those river valleys and its people relates to an expedition of 1569,Newitt (1982), pp. 152-3 which places the Makua people along the Lower Zambezi valley and the related Lolo people around Tete, with no indication of powerful Maravi states in the area. According to a further account of 1590, the Makua had recently lost control of the south bank of the Zambezi and the Lolo had been displaced eastward: these two groups then occupied roughly the same area of Zambezia province as today.Newitt (1982), pp. 154-5. There are also several contemporary or near-contemporary accounts which indicate a Portuguese involvement in a rather limited Zambezi ivory trade in the mid-16th century, probably involving the Makua people rather than the Maravi.Newitt (1982), pp. 147-9 Although these sources do not specifically name the invaders that displaced the Makua and Lolo, it seems that they came from the north and are plausibly interpreted as being Maravi and as forming the Lundu state, although the chiefly title of Lundu and the name Maravi are not recorded until 1616, and the title Kalonga, that of the most senior Maravi ruler, is recorded only from 1660.Newitt (1982), p. 157 Rather than a Maravi empire being formed well to the north of the Zambezi and expanding southwards, as in several accounts, it is more probable that a number of related but rather small groups from north of the Zambezi entered Zambezia in the 16th century and coalesced into loosely connected Maravi chieftainships which were forced, when their further advance was prevented by the Portuguese, to recognise one or more paramount chiefs.Newitt (1982), pp. 158-9 In the early 17th century, according to Portuguese accounts recorded in 1648, an individual named Muzura, who had worked for the Portuguese, established himself as the overlord of the Maravi chieftainships on the north bank of the Zambezi with Portuguese support in 1608, and he retained this position until around 1635, defeating an attempt of the Lundu chief to revolt in 1622.Newitt (1982), p. 159Schoffeleers (1992), p. 127 One theory is that Muzura's successors adopted the title of Kalonga and ruled what came to be called the Maravi Empire,Newitt (1982), p. 160 including three other substantial kingdoms or paramount chieftainships: Lundu along the Lower Shire, Kaphwiti in the Shire Highlands and Undi to the west of the Shire valley, in the area of what is now the Mozambique-Zambia border.Schoffeleers (1992), p. 42 Another is that the Kalonga state, whose main seat is believed to have been south of Lake Malawi,Phiri (1979), p. 9 already existed but did not take part in the expansion into Zambezia so was unknown to the Portuguese in the early 17th Century. In this reconstruction, Muzura formed a state in the Mwanza area of the mid-Shire valley, between Lundu and Kalonga, which Kalonga took over by on his death, only then gaining paramountcy over the three chieftainships to the southSchoffeleers (1987), p. 339 The people of the Maravi cluster diversified over time to become, from north to south the Tumbuka, Chewa, Nyanja and Mang'anja, although these successors retained certain common beliefs.Newitt (1982), pp. 147-8 =Pre-colonial 19th century= At the end of the 18th century, the original Lundu kingdom among the Mang'anja people was based in the Lower Shire valley, but was vulnerable to aggression from Portuguese slave-traders. Over a half -century beginning in the early 19th century, an individual named Mankhokwe, who already controlled the Katchsi shrine in Thyolo District in the Shire Highlands, gained control of the Middle Shire and western Shire highlands He then claimed the paramountcy and title of Lundu, and attempted to gain control of the Khulubvi shrine. In the Lower Shire, another chief with the title Tengani built up a force able to resist the Portuguese threat, at least temporarily, and the original Lundu state and its title holder descended into obscurity.Schoffeleers (1972), pp. 74-5 The situation of the Mang'anja in the 1860s, as described by members of David Livingstone's expedition or the Universities' Mission to Central Africa, was that there was a hierarchy of chiefs and headmen of varying power and influence. Theoretically, the paramount chief with the title Lundu was at the apex of this hierarchy, his prestige deriving from his control of one or more rain shrines, but his power over other major chiefs was limited. In practice, Mankhokwe, the pretender to the Lundu title had more power than the hereditary title-holder.White (1987), pp. 46-7 Senior chiefs controlling significant areas were in theory appointed by the paramount but they .had followings in the areas they controlled and, in some cases, also controlled rain shrines: as the provision of rain was central to Mang'anja religion and daily life, being the patron of such a shrine was a source of significant power.White (1987), p. 60 The nature of one shrine was described in 1862, when it was claimed that the spirit of a former chief, M'Bona, communicated with a prophetess in dreams.Rangeley (1953), p. 17 Although an Afro-Portuguese slave-trader, Paul Mariano II, managed to defeat Tengani, capture many slaves and destroy the Khulubvi shrine in 1862,Schoffeleers (1992), p. 96 Tengani survived with a reduced chiefdom and was later recognised by the colonial authorities as the senior Mang'anja chief. However some of the Kololo that Livingstone had brought from Botswana as porters for his Zambezi expedition, and left in the Shire Valley at the end of his expedition in 1864, established chieftainships along the Middle and Lower Shire valley outside Tengani's influence. Mankhokwe had to face Kololo pressure on the Middle Shire and Yao attacks in the Shire Highlands, so he and his people later migrated to the hills west of the Shire River, deserting the ancestral Mankhokwe rain shrine, which fell into disuse once its Mang'anja devotees had left the area.Schoffeleers (1972), p. 85 Paul Mariano II died in 1863 and was succeeded by his young son, Paul Mariano III. After Paul Mariano III reached adulthood, he reached an agreement with the Portuguese authorities in 1879 which left him in control of the Lower Shire Valley as far south as its confluence with the Zambezi, until a subsequent Portuguese governor attacked Mariano's stronghold on 1884-85, following which many of Mariano's chikunda, or native soldiers, moved into the area around the Khulubvi shrine, destroying villages and taking slaves until when, from 1889 onwards, first a Portuguese expedition led by Alexandre de Serpa Pinto and later a British one under Henry Hamilton Johnston entered the area to quell the disorder. The Lower Shire Valley was divided between the two powers by an 1891 Anglo- Portuguese treatySchoffeleers (1992), pp. 97-8 The British Central Africa Protectorate that was set up in 1891 protected the Mang'anja people from further attacks by Mariano's former chikunda or the Kololo chiefs of the Middle Shire, and the protectorate authorities later recognised Tengani as protector of the Khulubvi shrine.Schoffeleers (1992), pp. 98-9 The M'Bona Cult = The nature of M'Bona = The History of the M'Bona sect is closely bound up with that of the Mang'anja people, who currently live mainly in the north of Nsanje district and south of Chikwawa district in the Lower Shire valley of Malawi, and also in adjacent areas of Mozambique. However, before the migrations of the Yao and Lomwe into the north-western part of their former territory and the Sena in the south, all of which began in the mid-19th century, they had ranged from the mid-Zambezi valley near Vila de Sena through the Lower and Middle Shire valley and into the western part of the Shire Highlands.Schoffeleers (1972), pp. 81-3 A description of the M'Bona cult dating from 1953 recounted then-current traditions of M'Bona who, it was claimed, possessed rainmaking powers and was a relative of the ruler who had the hereditary title of Lundu. M'Bona fled south because he had usurped the Lundu's power as a ruler and intermediary with the High God to ensure prosperity for his people. M'Bona had made rain during a drought after the Lundu had failed to do so, and was accused of witchcraft. During his flight, M'Bona was said to have rested in several places in southern Malawi, all within the area inhabited by the Mang'anja, before he was killed by his pursuers and beheaded. The places where he rested and that where he was killed were said to have become rain-shines after his death.Rangeley (1953), pp. 9-15 Jan Matthew Schoffeleers, who studied the cult for other 30 years, notes the opposing traditions that an historical M'Bona was either a relative of the first Lundu, as in Rangeley's account, or a priest of the Khulubvi rain shrine who had been killed by the first Lundu when he destroyed that shrine, and he proposed a third possible explanation, that M‚ÄôBona was the personification of the suffering of the Mang'anja people conquered by the Lundu, rather than a single individual.Schoffeleers (1972), pp. 169-70 Schoffeleers suggested that a change in Portuguese policy in the 1590s, which involved setting up forts in the Zambezi valley and employing African mercenaries called Zimba, who attacked uncooperative local rulers and raided for slaves, disrupted agriculture and caused widespread suffering throughout an area that included southern Malawi. These Zimba conquerors set up more centralised states, including one whose leader had the title of Lundu, and destroyed centres of possible resistance, including cult shrines,Schoffeleers (1992), pp. 117, 121-3, 126 with the intention of replacing these by cult of his own ancestors, so combining secular and ritual power in a single office that he occupied instead of being separate.Schoffeleers (1980), pp. 247-8 However, the alien Lundu had no means of communicating with the territorial spirits whose shrines his mercenaries had destroyed, so the original population regarded his rule, and his claim to possess rain-making powers, as illegitimate.Schoffeleers (1992), pp. 8, 117-8 Once the first Lundu was defeated in 1622 by the Portuguese who had turned against him, his claim to control the ritual activity of rain-calling ended. Although he and his successors retained political control, a form of dual authority was re-established.Schoffeleers (1980), p. 248. the Khulubvi shrine was restored but was rededicated to M‚ÄôBona, a martyr who Schoffeleers initially considered to be a historical person,Schoffeleers (1980), p. 250 but later either a priest of the shrine or a personification of the suffering of the conquered Mang'anja people.Schoffeleers (1992), pp. 4, 169-70 Schoffeleers initially claimed that the M'Bona rain shrine at Khulubvi in Nsanje District in the lower Shire Valley, where it is said M'Bona's head was placed after his killing, had been in existence since at least 1500 and was at the heart of a cult whose influence stretched as far as the Indian Ocean in the east, Tete in the west, the Shire Highlands in the north and the Lower Zambezi valley in the south, and that it gave rise to other M'Bona shrines.Schoffeleers (1972), p. 73 Subsequently, following excavation at the site by an archaeologist, the same scholar reported that material dating from between the 8th and 17th centuries had been found at Khulubvi.Meyer and Reis (2006), pp. 31-2 However, Schoffeleers considered that, before its destruction by the Lundu around 1600, its original form was as a shrine to the High God manifested as a python, whereas when restored it became a shrine to M‚ÄôBona, a martyr whose nature could be either that of a single individual or the personification of the suffering that the people conquered by Lundu suffered.Schoffeleers (1992), pp. 4, 169-70 Another scholar considers M'Bona to have originated as a river god or spirit of a type known in other parts of Zambezia, the area of the Zambezi and its tributaries, as much as a protector against floods as a provider of rain, adding that some of these precursors of M'Bona were female.Wrigley (1988), pp. 369-71 In at least one 19th century case, M'Bona was a female spirit, and her husband was a snake, which Wrigley links to the widespread African mythological theme of the conflict of the eagle, representing lightning and flood, and the python, representing the rainbow and adequate rainfall, and protector against flood or drought.Wrigley (1988), pp. 370-1, 2 It seems unlikely that there was originally a single M'Bona cult with many shrines over a wide area so much as a range of shrines devoted to different versions of a widespread myth. Although the Khulubvi shrine was of considerable antiquity, its original form may have been that of a shrine to the python god, only later becoming a shrine of M'Bona. Wrigley (1988), p. 372 There are three rain-shrines in central Malawi among the Chewa people, another offshoot of the Maravi. The first was at Msinja, where its female founder was also said to be of a ruling lineage, the first in a line of priestesses and prophetesses called Makewana. However, In contrast to M'Bona, there was no suggestion that the first Makewana was or became a deity: instead she was said to be possessed by god. The two other minor rain cults were not associated with a ruling family and little is known of them.Rangeley (1952), pp. 32-3 The reconstruction of Territorial Cults in Central Africa by Ranger described below suggests that most of these cults changed their nature over time, from shrines originally devoted to nature spirits with female priestesses or mediums, becoming shrines controlled by locally-powerful families, which reclassified the spirit as that of a deceased ancestor, and its priestesses as wives of that spirit.Ranger (1973), pp. 582-5 This suggests that Wrigley may be correct on the ultimate origin of the cult, and that the priestesses and prophetesses at the Msinja may be relics of more widespread former practice. However, Schoffeleers entirely dismisses Wrigley's claim that accounts of M'Bona are a myth, insisting on M'Bona having had some form of historical reality and dating his death to around 1600.Schoffeleers (1988), p. 387-8 Initially, when they met Livingstone's party and the UMCA missionaries, officials of the M'Bona cult were hostile to their exposition of Christian doctrines, regarding them as likely to undermine Mang'anja society.McCracken (2012), pp. 124-5 However, when many of the Mang'anja became Christians from the 1920s, particularly under the influence of Catholic missionaries, the M'Bona cult incorporated some Christian themes into its belief system, modifying the nature of the M'Bona myth by portraying M'Bona as a prophet and martyr, the black parallel of Jesus, and the saviour through his death of black people, as Jesus is for whites.Schoffeleers (1972), pp. 86-7Schoffeleers (1975), pp. 23-4 Although most adherents to the M'Bona cult were Mang'anja, when Lomwe people with similar social structures moved into areas inhabited by Mang'anja people, they were also allowed to adopted the cult, although Sena people, who were immigrants from Mozambique as were the Lomwe, were not. In the south of Nsanje district, Sena residents began to outnumber the existing Mang'anja population in the first quarter of the 20th century, although most village headmen were Mang'anja, whose use of M'Bona shrines distinguished them from Sena villagers who had lower status.Schoffeleers (1972), p. 87 =The Shrines= The sacred sites currently associated with M'Bona and claimed to derive from Khulubvi are found at Nyandzikwi, Nkhadzi and Mwala in Nsanje District; Kaloga sacred cave in Mwabvi Wildlife Reserve, where sacrifices were offered in times of drought, disease or other calamities; Chifunda Lundu, the present day headquarters of Paramount Chief Lundu, Mtsakana and Konde Dzimbiri rain shrines, all three in Chikwawa district and a hut for the worship of M'Bona at Katchsi in Thyolo district.UNESCO 2011, pp. 1-2 These are all, except for Katchsi, in the Shire valley to the west of the river, in a zone of around 120 km from north to south. Rangeley also mentions Dzambawe and Nyangazi, both in Mozambique as sites connected to M'Bona Rangeley (1953), pp. 12-14 The principal Khulubvi rain shrine was destroyed an incursion from Mozambique in the early 1860s, but soon rebuilt.Rangeley (1953), pp. 24-5 Rangeley and Schoffeleers have both given accounts of the M'Bona rites as they existed in the 1950s and 1960s, or as they had existed and were recorded in popular memory. Schoffeleers' more detailed account relates specifically to the Khulubvi shrine.Schoffeleers (1992), p. 49 The Khulubvi shrine and others were built in thickets, so not easily visible, and contained three huts, each rebuilt when it fell into decay, one for M'Bona, another for his spirit wife and the third for the wife's maidservant.Schoffeleers (1992), p. 52 \\"Spirit wives\\", were a common feature of all the shrines; permanently celibate women who traditionally served until death and received Mediumshipspirit messages}] for their communities in the form of dreams.Rangeley (1953), p. 26 At Khulubvi and other shrines, a woman of marriageable age was traditionally selected as the spirit wife of M'Bona with the title Salima and supported by a handmaiden.Schoffeleers (1992), p. 33-4 After the 1880s, the position of Salima lost status and was filled by elderly widows, and the handmaiden was a young girl with the name Camanga who only served until puberty, although the post may earlier have been one for a woman of marriageable age . No spirit wives were recorded after the late 19th century.Schoffeleers (1992), pp. 54, 97 In some cases, M'Bona's spirit was said to communicate with Salima in dreams, in others the medium was a male officiant of the shrine. No women held the positions of Salima or Camanga in the 1950s, and the mediums at that time were male.Rangeley (1953), pp. 18-9 Schoffeleers suggests that mediums associated with the cult at Khulubvi only began that association around 1900, after the line of spirit wives ended, when a female medium replaced Salima. Later mediums were usually male but included two females; some were descended from the first medium, others were relatives of a shrine guardian.Schoffeleers (1992), pp. 77-8 Each shrine has one or more hereditary guardians or principals, of which Khulubvi had two competing ones from two chiefly lineages, and two officials responsible for its upkeepRangeley (1953), p. 16Schoffeleers (1992), pp. 23, 71-2 At Khulubvi the medium also has guardians and an interpreter of what the medium's utterances mean.Schoffeleers (1992), p. 79 There were three main M'Bona rites at Khulubvi, annual communal rain prayers, rebuilding the shrine and, formerly, the induction of a new spirit wife. Rain prayers, accompanied by libations of millet beer, are said to be offered in October and November each year at the end of the dry season, and again if there is a drought.Schoffeleers (1992), p. 61 Huts within the shrine are built out of insubstantial materials and never repaired but rebuilt, with an accompanying animal sacrifice, when the existing ones fall into decay.Schoffeleers (1992), pp. 66-7 Rangeley says little about rites at the shrines, except that offerings of live animals, grain and beer were made to ensure plentiful rainfall.Rangeley (1952), p. 31 The cult declined during the early 20th century, and several shrines fell into disuse. However, following a widespread famine caused by a failure in the rains in 1949, it had a significant revivalRangeley (1953), pp. 24, 27 =Revival and politics= In the 1950s and until Malawi's independence in 1964, the Khulubvi rain shrine was associated with a chief whose title was Tengani.Rangeley (1953), p. 10 However, the Chief Tengani before independence was a supporter of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and also a committed Christian, who discouraged his people from using the shrineMcCracken (2012), pp. 224, 320Schoffeleers (1972), p. 86 Since independence, holders of the Lundu title became the leading traditional authority in the Lower Shire. The Lundu chiefs, who were unimportant village headmen in the 1920s,Wrigley (1988), p. 370 and associated with the subsidiary shrine of Chifunda Lundu,Rangeley (1953), p. 11 claimed descent from the powerful Lundu chiefdom that was broken up in the early 19th century: the last chief of the original Lundu lineage was murdered in 1864 by some of the Kololo that David Livingstone brought from Botswana in 1862 as porters for his Zambezi expedition and left in the Lower Shire area at the end of the expedition in 1864.Newitt (1995), pp. 280, 282 The current Lundu chiefs also claim that the Lundus before 1864 were patrons of the Khulubvi rain shrine, and although continuity between them and the 19th century Lundus is uncertain, the present title-holders are now recognised as patrons of that shrineWrigley (1988), p. 370.Schoffeleers (1975), p. 25 The Nyasaland famine of 1949, caused by a failure of the seasonal rains, was most severe in the south of the protectorate and led to a revival of the cult. In the aftermath of the famine, the colonial Agricultural Department introduced what it claimed were soil conservation techniques, more suited to sloping upland areas than the flat river valley. The M'Bona medium prophesied that use of these techniques would cause further drought. Although the administration imposed the regulations, this was the start of a period where the M'Bona medium opposed either the protectorate administration or the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland or both, culminating in the arrest and imprisonment of the medium during the 1959 State of Emergency.Schoffeleers (1972), p. 88 The Khulubvi shrine had a poor relationship with Molin Tengani, who retired in 1961. It hoped to improve this with his successor, Stonken Tengani, but he cut his links with the shrine in 1967.Schoffeleers (1972), pp. 88-9 M'Bona as a territorial cult There is no consensus among archaeologists and historians on the origin of the Maravi people, but many believe that there was a mingling of early settlers and a later ruling group. The former, sometimes known as the Chipeta, had moved into the area around the south of Lake Malawi early in the second millennium, perhaps from the 11th century onwards and, although they did not form centralised states, their leaders had the clan name Banda. The later ruling group were said to be migrants from the Katanga region who, sometime between the 14th and 16th centuries, brought ideas of chiefly power into what had been a stateless population. These newcomers belonged the Phiri clan of the Chewa people, and this clan formed a number of centralised states.McCracken (2012), pp. 20-1 However, as the account of Muzura shows, the claim to Phiri ancestry could be assumed by a successful parvenu, and Phiri titles such as Lundu (and also Kalonga, if it predated the mid-17th century) could be appropriated by previous subordinates.Newitt (1982), pp. 159-60Schoffeleers (1972), pp. 74-5 The concept of a \\"territorial cult\\" is one where the spirit venerated relates to a particular area, not to a kinship group. The cult's main function is to secure the well-being of the local people through one or more of rain-making, the control of floods, maintaining the fertility of the soil or promoting success in fishing or hunting. These spirits may either be nature spirits or deified former human beings, some with one central shrine, others with several separate shrines. Some, but not all, if these cults involve spirit possession or mediumship. Territorial cults generally involve the whole community of a particular area area, but are usually controlled by a local elite that provides priests, shrine guardians and other functionaries. This distinguishes territorial cults from ancestral cults that do not involve the whole community and spirit possession, which are not controlled by an elite and may spread a beyond an area.Ranger (1973), p. 582 Within this diversity, Ranger believes there are common themes, and the originally single people that later split into separate Chewa, Tumbuka and Mang'anja groups initially shared a common belief in a High God, and in spirits that acted as intermediates between that god and mankind. They also believed that humans that were able to communicate with the spirits. Ranger also considered that these ideas were modified later, so that some territorial cult continue to venerate a High God while others venerate nature spirits of deified humans.Ranger (1973), pp. 582-3 In some cases, a territorial cult dominates an area to the exclusion of other cults, in other areas it co-exists with other cults, and in recent time with Christianity.Ranger (1973), p. 594 Firstly, these ideas became attached to specific local sites and, in the absence of central leadership, local territorial cults formed, usually with a prominent family controlling the shrine and with priestesses \\"married\\" to a spirit intermediary acting as oracles or mediums. Secondly, before political organisation developed, there was some centralisation of local cults, with some accorded precedence over others.Ranger (1973), pp. 584-6 Thirdly, migrant members of the Phiri clan formed centralised states and took over control of many shrines, replacing the former guardian families with their officials and substituting deceased Phiri rulers or members of those relers' families as the spirits of the shrine. The role of priestesses was often reduced, with their function as mediums either ceasing or being taken over by men.Ranger (1973), pp. 586-7 Finally, the status of various shrines rose of fell as the fortunes of the states controlling them changed, to create the variety observed in recent times. In particular, where a state was conquered, what was previously a High God of an independent people may become the shine of a divinized human being from the conquering rulers, as may had been the case when the area around the original M'Bona shrine was conquered by the Lundu.Ranger (1973), pp. 591-2 Before the Phiri rulers gained power, it is claimed, M'Bona was the title of the priestess, the wife of the spirit intermediary, with her main shrine in Thyolo district and a minor shrine in Nsanje district. The latter became associated with a chief with real or assumed Phiri ancestry and the title Lundu, and the name M'Bona was transferred to a deceased member of the Lundu family. As the Lundu chiefs grew more powerful, the Khulubvi shrine gained prominence and the former priestess was demoted to the status of the newly named M'Bona's wife.Ranger (1973), pp. 587-8 However, some memory of her function as a medium may have remained, until this was taken over by a male medium. As the Lundu state expanded, it absorbed other cult sites, where the name M'Bona was applied to nature spirits of the river, who were protector against floodsRanger (1973), pp. 587-8 Schoffeleers accepts that a generalised Central African belief in a High God with spirit intermediaries existed, adding that, in one particular instance, this belief was transformed into the story of a human martyr, and this later absorbed other cults. He also accepts it is impossible to know if there was a single rain priest called M'Bona who persecuted and murdered or whether one or more members of an M'Bona priesthood were murdered and that name was attached to one or all of them.Schoffeleers (1972), pp. 78-9Schoffeleers (1992), p. 12 Nevertheless, he argues that, as the story of M'Bona's life and death is not part of any cult ceremony, it is not a myth in the normal sense but an orally-relayed biographySchoffeleers (1992), pp. 175-6  References  =Sources= * E.

The reserve occupies the northern section of the mountain which lies within the territory of Bulgaria and takes its name from the old name of Slavyanka. It is situated in the municipalities of Sandanski and Hadzhidimovo, Blagoevgrad Province. It was declared in 1951 to protect the largest forests of the endemic Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii) in the Balkan Peninsula. Its territory was further expanded several times and spans an area of 1638 ha or 16,38 km2. It was declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1977. The reserve was created to protect the largest forests of Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii) in the Balkans and is renowned for its rich flora ‚Äî over 1500 species found within its limited territory.  Geography  The reserve is situated on the northern slopes of the Slavyanka mountain range at altitudes between 1140 and 2212 m. It is separated from the Pirin mountain range further north by the Paril Saddle. The mountain is formed by metamorphic Paleozoic limestone and marble that cover a granite nucleus. The territory of Ali Botush has varied geomorphological forms and a number of ridges, such as Brezata, Saint Constantine, Mitnitsata, Tepleshki Peak and Chaplen Bair. The reserve falls within the continental Mediterranean climate zone and due to its high altitude it also has Alpine climate. However, the Mediterranean influence is very strong and determines the rainfall regime, which has an autumn-winter maximum and a summer minimum. The mean temperatures in winter are much higher than the average temperatures at the same altitudes in the rest of the country. The influence of the foehn wind is very strong in the winter. The average annual temperature for the lower parts of the reserve is 14 ¬∞C and for the highest ‚Äî about 6 ¬∞C. The average duration of the period with temperatures above 10 ¬∞C for the low sections of the reserve is 200‚àí220 days and for the high ‚Äî 130 days. The annual precipitation ranges between 700 and 900 mm, and surpasses 900 mm in the highest zones. Due to the karst relief of the mountain the surface water resources of the reserve are scarce. The streams are sustained mainly with underground waters; rain provides 25‚àí30% of the total flow volume, whereas snow forms another 20‚àí25%. The soil covers consists of cinnamon forest soils in lower ground and brown forest soils at higher altitude. The humus- carbonate soil type predominates but there are also mountain-meadow soils in the highest sections. The humus-carbonate soils are shallow to moderately deep. They are usually dry and warm.  Flora  A view of the reserve Marina Polyana locality, the only place with potable water in the higher sections of the reserve Ali Botush is home to diverse flora which has remain intact and pristine due to the reserve's relative isolation in the border zone. On its tiny territory there are over 1500 species of vascular plants which makes it a key floristic formation centre in the Balkan Peninsula. There are over 20 Bulgarian endemic species, of which five can only be observed in the reserve, and 42 to 46 Balkan endemic taxa. The plant species are both from the Mediterranean evergreen forests biome and from the temperate forests biome. The deciduous forests in the lowest reaches of the reserve are dominated by European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and European hop-hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia), and more rarely ‚Äî sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa). The coniferous forest belt is composed of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), black pine (Pinus nigra), Norway spruce (Picea abies), European silver fir (Abies alba), Bulgarian fir (Abies borisii-regis), Macedonian pine (Pinus peuce) and Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii). The dominant tree species of lower coniferous belt between 1000 and 1450 m is the black pine, while the woods at higher altitudes up to 1800‚Äì1900 m are formed by Bosnian pine and are the largest of their kind in the Balkans. The reserve, as well as Pirin National Park are the only habitats of this pine species in Bulgaria. The average age of the Bosnian pine forests is 60 to 120 years, reaching over 200 and rarely 400 years. The height of the individual trees can surpass 30 m. The beech and the fir grow in shady habitats with riches soils while the Bosnian pine occupies zones with less nutrients. The shrub vegetation in the reserve is also varied and is composed of European yew (Taxus baccata), Bulgarian spurge laurel (Daphne kosaninii), spurge laurel (Daphne mezereum), Daphne oleoides and others. The herbaceous vegetation is very diverse due to the favourable climate and soil conditions, as well as the limestone bedrock. The Bulgarian section of Slavyanka is the only habitat of the endemic Convolvulus suendermanii. Important protected species include the black maidenhair fern (Adiantum capillus-veneris), Polygala nicaeensis, Rhamnus fallax, as well as the Balkan endemic species Fritillaria drenovskii, restricted to Slavyanka, Pirin and northern Greece, Pulsatilla rhodopaea, Saxifraga siribrnyi, long- spur violet (Viola delphinantha), restricted to this area of Bulgaria, as well as Greece, Paril centaurea (Centaurea parilica), restricted to Slavyanka and southern Pirin, etc. In 2012 one of the world's rarest fungi, Zeus olympius, known until then only from Mount Olympus in Greece, was discovered in Ali Botush. It grows only in association with Bosnian pine.  Fauna  The fauna of the reserve is also varied. The most common larger mammals include brown bear, gray wolf, roe deer, wild boar, European hare, red fox, European badger and golden jackal. The reptiles are diverse and include two species of turtles, spur-thighed tortoise and Hermann's tortoise, as well as numerous snakes and lizards, such as the rare European cat snake and the Erhard's wall lizard. It is the only place in Bulgaria where the Macedonian crested newt is found. Of the invertebrate species between 55 and 60% belong to the Mediterranean biome. So far, over 1200 insect species have been described from the reserve. The diurnal butterflies are of particular interest. In 1992 biologist Zdravko Kolev identified five new butterfly species for Bulgaria ‚Äî eastern greenish black-tip (Euchloe penia), Phalakron blue (Polyommatus andronicus), Grecian anomalous blue (Polyommatus aroaniensis),, Higgin's anomalous blue (Agrodiaetus nephohiptamenos) and Dils' grayling (Pseudochazara orestes); of them all except for the eastern greenish black-tip are Balkan endemic species and all other than the Grecian anomalous blue can be observed in Bulgaria only in Slavyanka and Pirin mountains.

Preseli's was the first foal of her dam Hill of Snow who showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race from nine starts, but did better as broodmare, producing Snowfire (runner-up in the 1000 Guineas), Kong (Lingfield Derby Trial) and Mount Kilimanjaro (Further Flight Stakes). Hill of Snow was a daughter of the Kentucky Oaks winner White Star Line. Racing career =1999: two-year-old season= Preseli made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Roscommon Racecourse on 4 July and started at odds of 7/1 in a ten-runner field. She was restrained by Ahern in the early running and was still in seventh place entering the last quarter mile but then made rapid progress, took the lead inside the final furlong and won by a length from the John Oxx-trained favourite Potentille. On 22 August the filly was moved up in class for the Listed Debutante Stakes over the same distance at Leopardstown Racecourse and started 7/1 second choice in the betting behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained Amethyst who was made the 1/4 favourite. After racing fourth of the six runners she made steady progress in the straight, caught the front-running Amethyst in the final strides, and won by three quarters of a length. Preseli was stepped up to Group 1 class and started at odds of 9/1 for the Moyglare Stud Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 5 September. The British-trained Littlefeather started favourite after an impressive win at Chester, while the other ten runners included Amethyst, Torgau and Eurolink Raindance (second in the Sweet Solera Stakes). Torgau set the pace and opened up a clear lead approaching the final furlong as Preseli began to make rapid progress. Preseli caught Torgau in the closing stages and won by three quarters of a length with Littlefeather a length and a half away in third. After the race Eddie Ahern said \\"She travelled well all the way and really quickened when I asked her to go\\" while Michael Grassick commented \\"Preseli is in the Irish 1,000 guineas and the Irish Oaks next season, and I think she will stay a mile and a half because the further they went today the stronger she was finishing\\". =2000: three-year-old season= On 14 May, Preseli began her second campaign in the Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial over one mile and, despite carrying a seven-pound weight penalty for her Group 1 win, started 7/4 favourite against eight opponents headed by the C L Weld Park Stakes winner Theoretically. After settling in second place she took the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and held off the late challenge of Storm Dream to win by a short head. At the Curragh two weeks later the filly attempted to take her unbeaten run to five when she started 5/1 second favourite for the Irish 1000 Guineas but never looked likely to win and finished unplaced behind Crimplene. Grassick later explained that the filly had been in season at the time. Preseli was moved up in distance for the Pretty Polly Stakes (then a Group 2 race) over ten furlongs at the Curragh on 1 July in which she was matched against older fillies and mares. Starting at odds of 6/1 she finished strongly but failed by a short head to catch the Barry Hills-trained Lady Upstage, to whom she was conceding five pounds in weight. Ahern received a suspension for \\"excessive use of the whip\\" on the filly. In the Irish Oaks two weeks later Preseli raced in third place before fading badly in the straight and came home ninth of the ten runners in a race won by Petrushka. =2001: four-year-old season= For the 2001 season, Preseli was transferred to the United States, where she was trained by the Englishman Michael Dickinson. She made little impact in her two races, finishing unplaced in the Waya Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in September and then running seventh in the Grade III Athenia Handicap at Belmont Park in the following month. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Preseli was retired to become a broodmare for Abergwaun Farms. In November 2011 she was offered for sale at Keeneland and was bought for $50,000 by the bloodstock agent R J Bennett. Four years later she returned to the sales ring at Keeneland and was sold to Aaron Sones for $16,000. She has produced at least nine foals and six winners: *Village Singer, a bay filly, foaled in 2004, sired by Rahy. Won one race. *Arizona John, bay colt (later gelded), by Rahy. Won ten races. *A Girl, bay filly, 2006, by Sadler's Wells. Won one race. *Mountain Woman, bay filly, 2008, by Montjeu. Failed to win in 14 races. *Echoes In The Wind, bay filly, 2009, by Montjeu. Unplaced in her only race. *Hapiboy, bay colt (gelded), 2011, by A.P. Indy. Won one race. *Preseli's Pulpit, bay filly, 2012, by Pulpit. Won one race. *Tale of Preseli, bay filly, 2013, by Tale of Ekati. Won two races. *Pretty Kitty, filly, 2016, by Tale of Ekati Pedigree *Preseli was inbred 3 √ó 3 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the third generation of her pedigree.

Crown prince and commander-in-chief Abbas Mirza had launched a successful campaign in the summer of 1826, which resulted in the recapture of many of the territories that were lost to the Russians by virtue of the Treaty of Gulistan (1813). Noticing the approach of the Iranian army, many of the locals that had recently come under formal Russian jurisdiction, quickly switched sides. Amongst the swiftly recaptured territories by the Iranians were the important cities of Baku, Lankaran and Quba. Then Russian commander-in-chief in the Caucasus, Aleksey Yermolov, convinced that he had insufficient resources to battle the Iranians, ordered for the withdrawal from Elisavetpol (Ganja), which was thus retaken as well. Yermolov's replacement, Ivan Paskevich, now with additional resources, started the counteroffensive. At Ganja, in late September 1826, the Iranian and Russian armies met, and Abbas Mirza and his men were defeated. As a result, the Iranian army was forced to retreat across the Aras river.

It was collected by Mona Douglas in the 1940s or 50s and is popular among younger Manx dancers today.  History  The traditional custom on Good Friday on the Isle of Man was to gather shellfish on the shore and eat flitters in particular for breakfast,Manx Reminiscences after cooking them in the fire without the use of iron. A dance was collected in connection to these customs by Mona Douglas, who first mentioned it as ‚Äòpartly noted but still incomplete‚Äô in 1937.'Manx Folk Dances - Their Notation and Revival' by Mona Douglas (1937) in Mona Douglas: Manx Folk-Song, Folk Dance, Folklore: Collected Writings edited by Stephen Miller, Onchan: Chiollagh Books, 2004 Her informant at this stage,'Some Ritual Dances of Mann' by Mona Douglas (1957) in Mona Douglas: Manx Folk-Song, Folk Dance, Folklore: Collected Writings edited by Stephen Miller, Onchan: Chiollagh Books, 2004 a Mrs Callow of Cardle Veg, Maughold,Kiaull Manninagh Jiu, April 2011 was able to recall the process of gathering mychurachan to make a fire on the beach, in which \\"arran-traaie\\" barleymeal cakes were made and baked in the hot ashes and flitters were baked in their shells. After the meal accompanied by milk, the remains were thrown into the sea with the words: ‚ÄòGow shoh as bannee orrin‚Äô (‚ÄòTake this and bless us‚Äô) spoken as ‚Äòsome kind of prayer or charm.‚Äô It was after this that the Flitter Dance was performed, by pairs of dancers to ‚Äòwind to and fro in the shape of an S,‚Äô however, no steps or details of the actual dance were recalled by Mrs Callow. By 1957 Douglas had completed the collection of the dance, thanks to material from a Mrs Teare of Ballaugh and in particular from Ada Skillicorn and a Mrs Radcliffe of Maughold, who were able to provide the actual steps of the dance. The distinctive stamping step involved is not found in other traditional Manx dances and it was noted by Douglas as being ‚Äòpresumably used to stamp out any remaining live embers in the fires.‚Äô It was perhaps through these informants that Douglas learned that this dance was once the only dance permitted on Good Friday, that the throwing of the remnants of the food into the sea was linked to ‚Äòa very ancient Celtic ritual‚Äô and that it and the dance are a ‚Äòsurvival of a very ancient Gaelic ceremony of propitiation or sacrifice to powers of the sea.‚Äô The tune for the dance was also collected by Mona Douglas, who noted that 'the air belonging to this dance strikes me as very ancient, probably the oldest of all our Manx tunes.' The dance was brought back into performance in the 1960s by the Manx Folk Dance Society, who also revived the custom of Manx dancing at Easter. The first known modern performance of the Flitter Dance was given by the Manx Folk Dance Society, under Mona Douglas‚Äô supervision, on 18 April 1960 at a performance in Ballakermeen School for the visiting members of the English Folk Dance and Song Society.  Dance  The Flitter Dance was first published in Rinkaghyn Vannin in 1983. No mention is made here of an S-shape to the dance; rather, it is described merely as ‚Äòin processional form.‚Äô It is in this form that the dance is performed today. The dance is in two halves: firstly, the distinctive stamp steps; then two sets of side-steps and the Manx Balance (a distinctive swinging of the foot in a kicking motion), before re-joining the same partners and repeating. Because of its simple and repetitive form, the dance is popular today for beginners and young dancers alike.

In 1873 a system of recruiting areas based on counties was instituted under the Cardwell Reforms and the barracks became the depot for the two battalions of the 10th (North Lincolnshire) Regiment of Foot. The regiment moved to the \\"new barracks\\" further north on Burton Road in 1880. The building was vacant until 1901 when it became the headquarters of the Lincolnshire Yeomanry. The regiment was mobilised at the old barracks in August 1914 before being deployed to Salonika. The building remained the headquarters of the Lincolnshire Yeomanry until it was disbanded in 1920. It then became the headquarters of the 60th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, a Territorial Army unit, in 1922. The regiment was mobilised at the old barracks in September 1939 before being deployed to France with the British Expeditionary Force. The regiment was disbanded at the end of the war without ever returning to the barracks. After the war the building was used by the 49th (East Midlands) Armoured Workshop Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and then by the 70th Communication Zone Workshop Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers before being vacated in 1963.

Born in Chicago in 1866 to Mary (Delafield) Sturges and George Sturges, she graduated in 1885 from the Kirkland School, a high school, in Chicago. She married William Francis Dummer (1851‚Äì1928), a prominent Chicago banker, in 1888. The couple had four daughters‚ÄîMarion, Ethel, Katharine, and Frances‚Äîand a son who died in infancy. Although she had no formal education beyond secondary school and never held a paid job, she played a significant role in the Chicago school of sociology and in professional sociology in general, according to sociologist Jennifer Platt. Dummer funded projects she considered important and encouraged professionals to work on them. She often provided to these professionals relevant data gathered by networks of social reformers, many of them women. In a review of Dummer's autobiography, Why I Think So ‚Äì The Autobiography of an Hypothesis (1937), Thomas Eliot of Northwestern University, said, \\"Mrs. Dummer is best recognized in her intellectual enthusiasms, and in her generous tributes and contributions (spiritual and material) to the work of others.\\" In 1905, she joined the National Child Labor Committee and the Chicago Juvenile Protective Association, and in 1908, she became a founder and trustee of the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy, later the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration. She extended financial support to entities such as the Juvenile Psychopathic Institute and to prominent psychologists, psychiatrists, and sociologists including Adolf Meyer, Thomas Eliot, William Alanson White, Trigant Burrow, Katharine Anthony, Jessie Taft, and others. She funded research, writing, and administrative projects undertaken by Miriam Van Waters, a well-known prison reformer. She helped found the Illinois Society for Mental Hygiene and served on the boards of the City Club of Chicago, and the National Probation Association. Among Dummer's published work are prefaces to The Unadjusted Girl by William I. Thomas (1923), a prominent sociologist and author. Concerned about the unequal treatment of women and men involved in what were known as sexual vice crimes, Dummer paid Thomas $5,000 a year for two years to research and analyze cases involving female prostitutes and unmarried mothers. Drawn to the work of Mary Boole and her husband, mathematician George Boole, Dummer supported publication of Mary Boole's collected works in 1931 and wrote a pamphlet, Mary E. Boole: A Pioneer Student of the Unconscious in 1945. Dummer's wide-ranging interests included biology, psychiatry, anthropology, and economics. The Unconscious: A Symposium (1928); The Evolution of a Biological Faith (1943), and What is Thought? (1945) were among her other published works. After 1947, Dummer lived with her daughter Katharine Dummer Fisher in Winnetka, Illinois. She died in Winnetka in 1954; memorial services were held at the Institute for Juvenile Research in Chicago.

JAXA, 2017 Developed by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and announced on 9 June 2015, MMX will land and collect samples from Phobos once or twice, along with conducting Deimos flyby observations and monitoring Mars' climate. The mission aims to provide key information to help determine whether the Martian moons are captured asteroids or the result of a larger body hitting Mars. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and other Japanese government officials officially approved the MMX project to proceed into development on 19 February 2020, according to a post on JAXA's website.https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/02/20/phobos-sample-return-mission- enters-development-for-2024-launch/ - 21 February 2020 Overview Phobos, the largest moon of Mars The spacecraft will enter orbit around Mars, then transfer to Phobos, and land once or twice and gather sand-like regolith particles using a simple pneumatic system. The lander mission aims to retrieve a minimum of samples. The spacecraft will then take off from Phobos and make several flybys of the smaller moon Deimos before sending the Sample Return Capsule back to Earth, arriving in July 2029.

JAXA will partner with the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) to develop the ‚ÄúSuper Hi-Vision Camera‚Äù which combines a 4K and 8K camera, making it the first time that Mars will be imaged in 8K resolution. Images will be regularly transmitted back to Earth with flight data, in order to recreate MMX exploration around Mars and its moons. The original image data will be stored in a recording device in MMX's return capsule and brought back to Earth as part of the sample return portion of the mission. Additionally, the Gravity GradioMeter (GGM), Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS), Mission Survival Module (MSM) were proposed as additional instruments. Following a study by the French CNES space agency, it was decided that the spacecraft will deliver a small rover provided by CNES and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The rover will be equipped with cameras, a radiometer, and a Raman spectrometer for in-situ surface exploration of the Martian moon. Sampling MMX's sampler is equipped with two sampling methods: the Coring Sampler (C-SMP) to gain regolith at depths deeper than 2 cm from the Phobos surface, and the Pneumatic Sampler (P-SMP) from the Phobos surface. The robotic arm will collect regolith from the ground by shooting the C-SMP mechanism. The C-SMP mechanism is designed to rapidly perform subsurface sampling to collect over 10 grams of the regolith. It is equipped with an ejecting actuator that uses a special shape memory alloy, SCSMA Hiroki Kato, Yasutaka Satou, Kent Yoshikawa, Masatsugu Otsuki, and Hirotaka Sawada, (2020), Subsurface Sampling Robot for Time-limited Asteroid Exploration, Proceedings of IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Las Vegas, October 2020.

Viruses consist of a genome and a capsid; and some viruses are enveloped. Most virus capsids measure between 20-500 nm in diameter. Because of their nanometer size dimensions, viruses have been considered as naturally occurring nanoparticles. Virus nanoparticles have been subject to the nanoscience and nanoengineering disciplines. Viruses can be regarded as prefabricated nanoparticles. Many different viruses have been studied for various applications in nanotechnology: for example, mammalian viruses are being developed as vectors for gene delivery, and bacteriophages and plant viruses have been used in drug delivery and imaging applications as well as in vaccines and immunotherapy intervention.  An Introduction to Virus Nanotechnology  Virus nanotechnology is one of the very promising and emerging disciplines in nanotechnology. A highly interdisciplinary field, viral nanotechnology occupies the interface between virology, biotechnology, chemistry, and materials science. The fields employs viral nanoparticles (VNPs) and its counterparts of virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) for potential applications in the diverse fields of electronics, sensors, and most significantly at clinical field. VNPs and VLPs are attractive building blocks for several reasons. Both particles are on the nanometer-size scale; they are monodisperse with a high degree of symmetry and polyvalency; they can be produced with ease on large scale; they are exceptionally stable and robust, and they are biocompatible, and in some cases, orally bioavailable. They are \\"programmable\\" units that can be modified by either genetic modification or chemical bioconjugation methods.  Viruses  A virus is a biological infective agent that infect living hosts and reproduces inside the host cells. Viral infect all forms of life; can cause disease in humans, animals, plants and even insects. The science of studying viruses also called as Virology. Unlike most living things, viruses do not have cells that divide; new viruses are assembled in the infected host cells. Therefore, viruses are ultimately called as obligatory parasites. Viruses contain genetic materials (either DNA or RNA) which give them the ability to mutate and evolve. It also has a protective coat termed the capsid which is made up of multiple numbers of protein monomers called capsomer. Some viruses have additional structural features such as a lipid envelope over capsid or they may consist of separate head and tail structures. E.g. Bacteriophage. Every year novel viruses emerged with the potential to cause disease and death worldwide. Today, over 5000 species of viruses have been discovered and described. Viruses spread in many ways. Just as many viruses are very specific as to which host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors. Some viruses of animals, including humans, are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viral infections can cause disease in humans, animals and even plants.  What is Nanotechnology?  Nanotechnology is the manipulation or self-assembly of individual atoms, molecules, or, molecular clusters into structures to create materials and devices with new or vastly different properties. Nanotechnology can work from the top down (which means reducing the size of the smallest structures to the nanoscale) or bottom up (which involves manipulating individual atoms and molecules into nanostructures) .The definition of nanotechnology is based on the prefix \\"nano\\" which is from the Greek word meaning \\"dwarf\\". In more technical terms, the word \\"nano\\" means 10‚àí9, or one billionth of something. For a meaningful comparison, a virus is roughly 100 nanometers (nm) in size. So that a virus can also call as a nanoparticle. The word nanotechnology is generally used when referring to materials with the size of 0.1 to 100 nanometres, however, it is also inherent that these materials should display different properties from bulk (or micrometric and larger) materials as a result of their size. These differences include physical strength, chemical reactivity, electrical conductance, magnetism and optical effects. Nanotechnology has an almost limitless string of applications in biology, biotechnology, and biomedicine. Nanotechnology has engendered a growing sense of excitement due to the ability to produce and utilize materials, devices, and systems through the control of matter on the nanometer scale (1 to 50 nm). This bottom-up approach requires less material and causes less pollution. Nanotechnology has had several commercial applications in advanced laser technology, hard coatings, photography, pharmaceuticals, printing, chemical- mechanical polishing, and cosmetics. Soon, there will be lighter cars using nanoparticle reinforced polymers, orally applicable insulin, artificial joints made from nanoparticulate materials, and low-calorie foods with nanoparticulate taste enhancers.  Viruses as Building Blocks in Nanotechnology  Viruses have long been studied as deadly pathogens to cause disease in all living forms. By the 1950s, researchers had begun thinking of viruses as tools in addition of pathogens. Bacteriophage genomes and components of the protein expression machinery have been widely utilized as tools for understanding the fundamental cellular process. On the basis of these studies, several viruses have been exploited as expression systems in biotechnology. Later in the 1970s, viruses are used as a vector for the benefit of humans. Since that, often viruses are used as vectors for gene therapy, cancer control and control of harmful or damaging organisms, in both agriculture and medicine.Lacey, L.A.; Kaya, H.K. (eds) Field Manual of Techniques in Invertebrate Pathology: Application and Evaluation of Pathogens for Control of Insects and Other Invertebrate Pests. Springer, Netherlands, 2007.Templeton, N.S. (ed.) Gene and Cell Therapy: Therapeutic Mechanisms and Strategies, 3rd ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2008. Recently, a new approach to exploiting viruses and their capsids for biotechnology began to change toward using them for nanotechnology application. Researchers Douglas and Young (Montana State University, Bozeman, MT, USA) were the first to consider the utility of a virus capsid as a nanomaterial. They have taken plant virus Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle Virus (CCMV) for their study. CCMV showed a highly dynamic platform with pH and metal ion dependent structural transitions. Douglas and Young made use of these capsid dynamics and exchanged the natural cargo (nucleic acid) with synthetic materials. Since then many materials have been encapsulated into CCMV and other VNPs. At about the same time, the research team led by Mann (University of Bristol, UK) pioneered a new area using the rod-shaped particles of TMV (Tobacco Mosaic Virus). The particles were used as templates for the fabrication of a range of metallized nanotube structures using mineralization techniques. TMV particles have also been utilized to generate various structures (nanotubes and nanowires) for use in batteries and data storage devices. Viral capsids have attracted great interest in the field of nanobiology because of their nanoscale size, symmetrical structural organization, load capacity, controllable self- assembly, and ease of modification. viruses are essentially naturally occurring nanomaterials capable of self-assembly with a high degree of precision. Viral capsid- nanoparticle hybrid structures, which combine the bio-activities of virus capsids with the functions of nanoparticles, are a new class of bionanomaterials that have many potential applications as therapeutic and diagnostic vectors, imaging agents, and advanced nanomaterial synthesis reactors.  Plant viruses in nanotechnology  Plant virus-based systems, in particular, are among the most advanced and exploited for their potential use as bioinspired structured nanomaterials and nano-vectors. Plant virus nanoparticles are non-infectious to mammalian cells also proved by Raja muthuramalingam et al. 2018. Plant viruses have a size particularly suitable for nanoscale applications and can offer several advantages. In fact, they are structurally uniform, robust, biodegradable and easy to produce. Moreover, many are the examples regarding functionalization of plant virus-based nanoparticles by means of modification of their external surface and by loading cargo molecules into their internal cavity. This plasticity in terms of nanoparticles engineering is the ground on which multivalency, payload containment and targeted delivery can be fully exploited. George P. Lomonossoff writing in \\"Recent Advances in Plant Virology\\", The capsids of most plant viruses are simple and robust structures consisting of multiple copies of one or a few types of protein subunit arranged with either icosahedral or helical symmetry. The capsids can be produced in large quantities either by the infection of plants or by the expression of the subunit(s) in a variety of heterologous systems. In view of their relative simplicity and ease of production, plant virus particles or virus-like particles (VLPs) have attracted much interest over the past 20 years for applications in both bio- and nanotechnology [Lomonossoff, 2011Lomonossoff G.P. Virus particles and the uses of such particles in bio- and nanotechnology. Carole Caranta, Miguel A. Aranda, Mark Tepfer and Lopez-Moya (Ed). Recent advances in plant virology. 2011, 363-379, Caister Academic Press. .]. As result, plant virus particles have been subjected to both genetic and chemical modification, have been used to encapsulate foreign material and have themselves, been incorporated into supramolecular structures. Significantly, plant viruses studied are not human pathogens, which have no natural tendency to interact with human cell surface receptors. Recently, a plant pathogenic virus are reported to used to synthesize a noble hybrid metal nanomaterials used as bio-semiconductor. = Plant viruses = Viruses cause several destructive plant diseases and are accountable for massive losses in crop production and quality in all parts of the world. Infected plants may show a range of symptoms depending on the disease but often there is severe leaf curling, stunting (abnormalities in the whole plant) and leaf yellowing (either of the whole leaf or in a pattern of stripes or blotches).Hull, R. Comparative plant virology, Second edition, Academic press, 2001. . Most plant viruses are therefore transmitted by a vector organism (insects, nematodes, plasmodiophorids and mites) that feeds on the plant or (in some diseases) are introduced through wounds made, for example during agriculture practices (e.g. pruning). Many plant viruses, for example, tobacco mosaic virus, have been used as model systems to provide a basic understanding of how viruses express genes and replicate. Others permitted the elucidation of the processes underlying RNA silencing, now recognised as a core epigenetic mechanism underpinning numerous areas of biology. Some properties of viral nanoparticles * Plant viruses come in many shapes and sizes: for example, the plant virus Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) measures 300x18 nm in size; it forms a hollow rod. The plant virus Potato virus X (PVX) forms flexible filaments of 515x13 nm. The following viruses have an icosahedral symmetry and measure between 25-30 nm: plant virus Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), bacteriophage Qbeta and mammalian adeno-associated virus (AAV). * These are just some examples, many different viruses are being engineered and studied for their potential applications in medicine, some examples of plant viruses include Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus, Red clover necrotic mottle virus, Physalis mosaic virus, Papaya mosaic virus. * Plant viruses and bacteriophages are not infectious toward mammals. In contrast to mammalian viruses, there is no risk of a viral infection. * Virus-like particles (VLPs) can be produced that lack the viral genome; these VLPs are non-infectious also toward plants and thus considered safe also from an agricultural point of view. * Viruses and their non-infectious counterparts can be produced through molecular farming in plants or fermentation in cell culture. * The virus-based nanoparticles can be tailored for specific applications using a number of chemical biology approaches:  Genetic modification can be used to modify the amino acid sequence of the capsid protein (also known as coat protein).  Bioconjugate chemistry can be used to introduce non-biological or biological cargos.  Lastly, while often shown as rigid materials, the viruses are dynamic materials that undergo swelling and other conformational changes allowing for cargo to be infused or encapsulated into their viral capsids. Manifold plant virus platform technologies are being developed and studied for many applications including: * Vaccines: VLPs or epitope display platforms * Immunotherapies: in situ vaccines * Molecular imaging contrast agents * Drug delivery: targeting both human health and plant health * Battery electrodes * Sensor applications  References  Nanotechnology ","title":"Virus nanotechnology"},{"id":"56007472","text":"The genus Annwoodia was named in 2017 to circumscribe an organism previously described as a member of the genus Thiobacillus, Thiobacillus aquaesulis - the type and only species is Annwoodia aquaesulis, which was isolated from the geothermal waters of the Roman Baths in the city of Bath in the United Kingdom by Ann P. Wood and Donovan P. Kelly of the University of Warwick - the genus was subsequently named to honour Wood's contribution to microbiology. The genus falls within the family Thiobacillaceae along with Thiobacillus and Sulfuritortus, both of which comprise autotrophic organisms dependent on thiosulfate, other sulfur oxyanions and sulfide as electron donors for chemolithoheterotrophic growth. Whilst Annwoodia spp. and Sulfuritortus spp. are thermophilic, Thiobacillus spp. are mesophilic. A. aquaesulis is moderately thermophilic with an optimum temperature of 43 ¬∞C and a temperature range of 30 ¬∞C to 55 ¬∞C - a similar temperature profile to the related genus Sulfuritortus  and is a facultative chemolithoautotroph that grows on reduced sulfur oxyanions such as thiosulfate as the electron donor and carbon dioxide or bicarbonate as the carbon source. Unlike Thiobacillus spp., Annwoodia spp. do not produce tetrathionate during growth on thiosulfate and can also grow heterotrophically on nutrient broth. Elementary sulfur is deposited by the organism in batch culture with thiosulfate as the electron donor, but not in chemostat culture. A. aquaesulis can use nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor, as well as molecular oxygen. The dominant respiratory quinone is ubiquinone-8 and the G+C fraction of the type strain of the type species is 67.5 mol%. All members of the genus produce volutin (polyphosphate) granules but not capsules or endospores. A. aquaesulis has a pH optimum of 7.5-8.0 and pH range of 7.0 to 9.0. Whilst nutrient broth and yeast extract will support heterotrophic growth, simple carbon compounds and ions such as sugars, organic acids, formate and monomethylamine do not support growth. Ammonium is the only source of nitrogen. Annwoodia aquaesulis strains have been detected in mixed-population packed-bed reactors containing limestone as a source of carbon, elementary sulfur as the electron donor and nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor, as well as in karstic sulfidic thermal groundwater ecosystems of broad similarity to those from which the type strain was isolated Annwoodia aquaesulis grown on thiosulfate, tetrathionate or trithionate has high growth yields, which are broadly similar to those of Thermithiobacillus spp., and are higher than members of the closely related genus Thiobacillus, indicating core metabolic differences. This high yield was observed in spite of 70% more carbon dioxide being fixed than could be accounted for as biomass, indicating the excretion of a carbon intermediate, which is not observed in Thermithiobacillus tepidarius, which was isolated from the same location at the Roman Baths in Bath, also by enrichment culture on thiosulfate as the sole electron donor and molecular oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor.

Most of the members of this subgenus have a metallic appearance, while some are non-metallic. There are over 630 species worldwide. They are commonly found in the Northern Hemisphere and are found in abundance in North America. Members of this subgenus also have very diverse forms of social structure making them model organisms for studying the social behavior of bees.  Morphology  Members of Lasioglossum (Dialictus) are small, about 3.4‚Äì8.1 mm in size, and distinguished from other halictids by a strongly arched basal vein and weakened distal veins on the forewings. Distinguishing between some of the species in Lasioglossum (Dialictus) proves to be difficult due to their ‚Äúmonotonous‚Äù morphology and subtle differences. Some species have been named based on geographic distribution and ecological niche rather than using any distinguishing morphological features.  Molecular  Genetic barcoding has developed into a commonly used identification tool for taxonomists, though Lasioglossum (Dialictus) lacks a distinct barcode gap. In addition to this group's subtle morphological differences, this causes identifications to be misleading or difficult to ascertain.  Ecology  = Solitary vs. communal = Though solitary bees such as Lasioglossum figueresi often live in proximity to each other, unlike communal bees, the nests of solitary bees are built by lone females. The female builds the nest and feeds her offspring without workers or help from other bees. Solitary bees often nest in the ground and tree bark. While not as well known as communal bees, solitary bees are important pollinators. Communal bees live in colonies of two or more females. Most of the building, foraging, and caring for the offspring are done by worker bees. The queen bee is often the only fertilized female in the colony and lays most if not all the eggs. = Semi-social (eusocial) = Each social behavior is not necessarily exclusive for individual species of L. dialictus. Some species have shown to exhibit social polymorphism depending on the climate of its habitat. In temperate climates, some female bees produce daughters that will remain unfertilized and help with foraging and care for the next generation of offspring. Whereas in colder climates such as at a higher latitude on a mountain side, the female will exhibit solitary behavior and all the daughters produced will be fertile. This is likely because with colder and shorter breeding seasons, the bee does not have enough time to produce two brood. In warmer climates with longer breeding seasons, having two broods, with the first brood caring for the second, can be more efficient = Parasitic = Bees exhibit parasitism by laying their eggs in the host bee's brood cells.

The first official Japanese referee in the NWA, he was known as one of the best referees in the business and the most popular referee in Japanese Puroresu history. He was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum as a member of the Class of 2018. Early life Higuchi Kanji was born on January 19, 1929, in Yokohama, Japan. He was a judo practitioner in his youth and became a judo instructor for the GHQ after World War II. Working as a trainer for the mostly-American soldiers, he was able to learn English and gained the nickname \\"Joe\\". JWA Higuchi had trained in professional wrestling with Raul Romero and Tojo Yamamoto and in 1954, he joined the All Japan Pro-Wrestling Association (which was run by Toshio Yamaguchi and Umeyuki Kiyomikawa) as a professional wrestler. In 1956, he competed in the Japanese Light Heavyweight division tournament where he finished as the third ranked Light Heavyweight in Japan. He also joined the JWA, which of whom he competed with in the 1950s and retired as an in-ring competitor in 1960. Having learned English during his time with the GHQ, Higuchi returned to the JWA as the interpreter and point of contact for gaijin (foreign) wrestlers. He made his debut as a referee in 1965. All Japan Pro Wrestling An AJPW original from its inception in 1972, Higuchi gained fame as the senior referee of the promotion, a position he held from 1972 to 1990.

He was the first official Japanese referee of the NWA, refereeing bouts such the NWA World Heavyweight Championship match between Jack Briscoe and Dory Funk Jr. in St. Louis, United States. In the early 80's AJPW bouts were booked more akin to the American style and Higuchi became known for his bump-taking. He retired as a referee in 1997 and took up the position of caretaker for the gaijin talent. He left AJPW in 1999 following the passing of its founder, Giant Baba. His last officiated match was the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship bout between Mitsuharu Misawa and \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams at Nippon Budokan in Tokyo on March 1, 1997.

The original artwork was created in 2013. It underwent enhancements in Lagos and was reissued in 2017 as a major collaboration project piece through Oxford University's OAC. According to the Vanguard news, parts of the art piece's collaboration effort were influenced by 1985's We Are the World music project. Observations by legal experts suggest that the eventual buyer of the artwork's reissue cannot financially exploit the heirloom until the year 2033, stating that all \\"proceeds at any time from sales will remain within the African economic system\\". Background Silver Spring, Maryland. In the spring of 2013, Olufeko known for his cross-disciplinary signature through technology, created the artwork on the premise of Social inclusion, brain gain and innovation. The art piece originally titled, Whatever is destroyed is created again, was made for and leveraged by an NGO, the United for Kids Foundation in Washington D.C. Revealed for the first time at the Whittemore House making its debut to the public, it successfully raised money for children, and all proceeds were used to build libraries and classrooms in Lagos, Nigeria. The artwork surfaced at another fundraiser at the Civic Center in Lagos, drawing affluent patrons of the arts, doubling donations of its previous auction. The conception of the finished piece is suggested to be a blueprint or predictive analysis of the continent's economic growth. As an inspiration of African incremental progress, its projections are aligned and is said to surpass some projections of the African Union (AU). Design The Non-traditional artwork is described as a visual albedo, it incorporates and is classified as; mixed media, digital abstracts and painted work. Portions of the piece were created via a graphics tablet on an iMac, and printed to heavy coated paper. It is sprinkled with crushed amethyst clusters, acrylic diamond confetti and inscribed with permanent markers. The year 2053 appears in the center of the work allowing interpretations of trajectories to theorists. As part of the reissue, signatures and enhanced artistic deformations were added for Art valuation. Reissue and Sungbo's Eredo In spring 2017, Olufeko attended and spoke at the Blavatnik School of Government's Breaking the Frame[works] conference alongside other thought leaders, discussing the \\"changing state of the African continent\\", on the topics of media, technology and governance. Prior to the conference, Olufeko collaborated with the conference team at Oxford to reissue the painting, \\"Philosophers‚Äô Legacy \\". The new version and charity experiment was created in stealth mode. The piece was completed in October 2017, making its debut inside Sungbo's Eredo, an African monument. The release coincided with the 10th anniversary marking of Visual Collaborative. Reception According to Road to Africa, the artwork's place in the Fourth Industrial Revolution can be leveraged to aid ongoing brain-gain initiatives to steer NGOs, the private sector and friends of the continent which includes its diasporas into a self-reliant, yet an interdependent partner of the world economy. =Signatures= The following is a list of persons at and outside the oxford conference who signed the artwork.

In early August 2017, six other fires in the complex (the Wallow, Garden, Grizzly, Mary, Rush, and Pointers Fires) were ignited by lightning within a few days. Initially, these fires were managed with a confine-contain strategy. Although this strategy was initially effective, as weather conditions became hotter and dryer throughout mid-August, the Island and Wallow fires spread. The Wallow Fire eventually engulfed the Pointers and Island fires, becoming the largest wildfire in the area, and began threatening Eco-Trust timber lands on State Responsibility Area. At that time, an Incident Management Team and CALFIRE began to work under unified command to combat the fires. All seven fires were incorporated into a complex on August 13, 2017, as the seven wildfires merged to form the Salmon August Complex Fire. On September 7, 2017, three additional fires (the Deep, Claire, and Fourth Fires) ignited and quickly merged into the Salmon August Complex Fire.

In 1899 he set a record of 43 miles and in 1908 he covered an incredible uninterrupted 50 miles. Holbein also made several attempts, ultimately all unsuccessful, to swim across the English Channel. = 1901 Attempt = In 1901, he tried to swim from France but was pulled out four miles from Dover. After his English Channel attempt, his eyes were so badly damaged from the salt water that he was unable to see for four days. = 1902 Attempts = On 1 August 1902, he failed again due to a tidal flow, heavy seas and a strong head wind, again four miles from Ramsgate. According to the accounts at the time, he swam for 4 hours 45 minutes and covered a distance of 18 miles, \\"the exact distance between the nearest points on the French and English shores\\".https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/PBH19020910.2.54 Paper's Past - Poverty Bay Herald 9-10-1902 Holbein was covered with oil and wore a mask.

He started his 1902 Channel crossing doing breaststroke at 25 strokes per minute, but then switched to backstroke at a 20 stroke-per-minute pace. Due to the turbulence in the Channel, his support crew got seasick and some returned to shore. During his attempt, he ate beef essence in liquid form and sandwiches, but was eventually pulled out when he could not make any headway against the tides. On 27 August 1902, Holbein started his third attempt of the English Channel from France to Dover in 63 degree F water. However, he was taken out of the water within a mile of Dover after an attempt of 22 hours 21 minutes.

It is native to the western Atlantic Ocean and is often found in estuaries and lagoons, commonly living in close association with oysters. Description The flatback mud crab is a small species of crab up to long with a noticeably flattened, oval carapace, with four blunt teeth on either side. In colour, this crab is dark olive brown or olive grey, often somewhat mottled, with dark brown limbs. One chela (claw) is much bigger than the other and the underside of the body and the limbs are a pale colour. Distribution and habitat The flatback mud crab is found in the sub-tropical and temperate waters of the western Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from Massachusetts to Florida and Texas, the Caribbean Sea, Bermuda, the Dutch West Indies and Uruguay. It occurs in the intertidal zone and the shallow sub-littoral zone, down to depths of about . It is tolerant of water of low salinities and occurs in estuaries. It is common in the Indian River Lagoon. It is generally associated with oysters, hiding between them and inside their valves. Ecology This crab has an omnivorous diet which includes algae, detritus, oyster spats, polychaete worms, sponges, amphipods and other small crustaceans. When fully submerged it moves about on the substrate but when exposed by the retreating tide it conceals itself, being particularly associated with beds of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica). It cannot withstand desiccation so it chooses moist places in which to hide. It shares its habitat with the black- fingered mud crab (Panopeus herbstii). The flatback mud crab is sometimes parasitised by Loxothylacus panopaei, a species of parasitic barnacle that develops inside a host crab, extruding a brood sac that the crab then carries under its abdomen and treats as it would its own eggs.

Nestled in a valley bordering the watercourse that bears its name, surrounded by fortified walls and moats, its history dates back to the 12th century. It was a dependency of the abbots of Mont-Saint-Michel who organised the cultivation of the fields and the woods and collected taxes. It was also a local justice court. Restoration of the Prieur√© began in 1989, when it was classified as a Monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.  History  = Founding = In 1022, Richard II (Duke of Normandy) gave the Priory of Saint-Pair and its outbuildings to Mont-Saint-Michel Abbey. The area was bound to the east by the public road of Coutances, to the north by the Vanl√©e (a coastal river), to the south by the small river Thar, and to the west by the sea with the island of Chausey. Various writings on local history describe the Oiseli√®re as being part of the dependencies of the abbey of Saint-Pair, of which no other written or archaeological trace is known. Thomas Le Roy has also claimed the 'Oiseli√®re' is the priory of Saint-Pair that in 1321 appears by name in historical acts authorizing the construction of its chapel. He refers to the construction of a chapel in Loyselli√®re in 1321, and the inventory of the charters of Mont-Saint-Michel from the 14th century which read: \\"Concessio episcopi pro capella de Loiseliere\\" which means: authorization of the bishop for the chapel of Oiseli√®re. In 1321, there was therefore already a building in existence to which the chapel was added. Studies of present-day Oiseli√®re allow us to imagine the building that was there before the additions. Rectangular in shape, it was on the site of the present cathedral hall and farmhouse. Its western exterior buttress forms the eastern wall and the norther wall of the cathedral hall and is visible from the inside of the ground floor of the present day manor. The addition of the chapel was made to the west of this first building. The Prael Forest, which was a dependency of Oiseli√®re, is mentioned by name earlier than Oiseli√®re. In 1294, there is a record of a donation to the monks by Thomas, esquire, Lord du Pont, of the Prael Forest, situated in the parish of Saint-Planchers. Then in 1297 a judgment was given between Guillaume du Bois and the monks for the Prael Forest in Saint-Planchers. It was found that Guillaume du Bois had the right to keep four cows and ten pigs in pasture and to take a cartload of wood each week (1297). = The Hundred Years War = Plan de l'Oiseli√®re, 1776. The history of the abbots of Mont-Saint-Michel provides some historical insight for the following years. > \\"In the year 1420, the Abbot Jolivet, troubled by so many pains and fatigues > endured with the upkeep and maintenance of this place of Mont-St-Michel, > [...] no longer having the heart to continue, comes out of his monastery the > same year 1420, and leaves.

His brother J. de Lamps, according to the Gallia Christiana, would go on to complete this work. The plan of the Oiseli√®re (1766) gives an idea of these works with the addition of the manor in the west. In the style of the Renaissance, terraced gardens were established on the site of the ramparts of the first building. = The commendatory abbots = Map of 1689.The Oiseli√®re served as a refuge for Arthur de Coss√© (illegitimate son recognized by Charles I, Count of Brissac) who in 1562 became bishop of Coutances, during one of the wars of religion, then abbot of Mont-Saint-Michel in 1570. He died there in 1587. The commendatory abbots, more concerned about the collection of income than the maintenance of buildings, let the manor fall into ruin. The 1698 statistics indicate that the barony of the Oiseli√®re, whose great manor was in the parish of Saint-Planchers, belonged to the abbots and priests of Mont-Saint-Michel. The term \\"barony\\" appears for the first time on this document and seems to indicate that L'Oiseliere was at that time more than a manor house and that its domain was considered big enough to justify this title. Thomas Cambernon was the last owner to benefit from the profits of the Oiseli√®re, before the lands were sold during the Revolution. = Abandonment and restoration = Old postcard. Over time, the buildings were used as a source of construction material for the surrounding residents. In 1878, Father Lecanu noted with sadness that the chapel had been divided into several rooms and appropriated for secular purposes, a bed occupying the place of the altar.

The Caetrati were a type of light infantry in ancient Iberia who often fought as skirmishers. They were armed with a caetra shield, swords, and javelins. History Iberian warriors had been fighting as mercenaries throughout Europe since the 5th century BC, with their ferocity in battle and their fighting skills making them very good additions to any ancient army. The Carthaginian general Hannibal made excellent use of them during his campaigns against Rome during the Second Punic War; when the Romans defeated Carthage and conquered its colonies in Hispania, they soon began to expand their borders in the region; it took them 200 years to fully conquer and pacify the region. These warriors fought vigorously against the Romans, especially under the leadership of Viriathus the Lusitanian and his guerrilla tactics that the Romans had never seen before. Being agile by nature, and wearing almost no armour at all, these warriors were extremely mobile and would use hit-and-run tactics to harass the enemy and break their formations. Equipment =Body armor= Iberian- Celtic helmet of the Chalcidian type 02 The majority of these soldiers wore simple tunics and lacked real armour because they relied on greater mobility. The cardiophylax was a very common piece of protection in ancient Iberia, most likely circular and with decorations and reliefs depicting animals and patterns. Strabo states the Celtiberians used a linen cuirass, probably in the Greek style. On the other hand, a number of vase paintings clearly show Iberian infantrymen wearing cuirasses of mail armour, with leather straps hanging down to protect the abdomen, but these heavier types of armour were probably used by the scutarii instead. The Iberians do not seem to have worn greaves, but Strabo states the Celtiberians did, and a number of reliefs do show infantrymen wearing greaves and short boots. The greaves may have been of metal or leather, but the ordinary soldier would probably have had greaves of felt. =Helmets= The Iberians wore bronze helmets, sometimes of Greek and Corinthian shape (due to Greek influence and trade in the southern and eastern parts of the peninsula), with either a low or high crest, but they seem to have been rare. They were probably worn only by the nobles and the tribal leaders. The crests are said to have been purple or crimson. The most common headwear seems to have been a simple helmet of bronze or leather, occasionally extended at the back to form a neckguard and with cheek guards added at the sides. Strabo says the Lusitanians wore helmets of sinew with a crest, and sculptures in southern Spain and South-west France do show some form of crested cap or hood. Diodorus Siculus says the Celtiberians wore helmets of brass or copper with red plumes. Another helmet widely used was the Montefortino helmet. Montefortino These helmets were mass produced and used during the First and Second Punic Wars, the Celtiberian Wars, the Lusitanian Wars and in the Civil War between Caesar and Pompeii. Montefortino helmets were believed to have originated in the Celtic occupied lands of northern Italy and soon became very common throughout the entire western Mediterranean. This helmet was so well thought of, and at the time so advanced, that it has been supposed that the Romans rapidly adopted it into their army. The Lusitanians seem to have not worn face guards perhaps because they blocked peripheral vision or just got in the way during combat. The soldiers would place a mane of dyed horse hair of various colours in it, or coloured feathers, perhaps to identify which tribe or military unit he belonged to or to signify rank, like a Roman centurion worn to indicate status within the Roman military formation. =Shield= Caetra This was the only shield these light infantrymen used, hence their name. The shield was circular, with a diameter between 30 cm and 90 cm. It was tied to the warrior's body with ropes or leather strips that passed over the shoulder and that gave great mobility to fight both on foot and on horseback. The shapes and decorations of the shields had variations in their metal, wood or leather protection. In combat, the shield was not only effective at blocking, but also an extremely proficient secondary weapon: Iberian troops used the boss to punch opponents. These compact bucklers could be hung on a belt or across the back by a strap, so as not to be burdensome to the soldier on the march or foraging for food, but still handy for when the enemy was close. Cavalry would usually carry the buckler so as to not over encumber their mounts or limit their horsemanship. =Swords= Iberian Falcata replica Of all the weapons the Caetrati bore, the sword is the one that stands out the most. Iberians, Celtiberians and Lusitanians were among the finest swordsman of their time. Falcata The most emblematic and effective weapon used by these warriors, it brought terror to the toughest Roman legionnaire. It was without a doubt their weapon of choice for over several centuries. This can be said due to the large amounts of these swords found on excavation sites throughout Portugal and Spain. According to the classical texts, the falcata used in the Iberian Peninsula was manufactured to perfection. Lusitanian warriors maintained a spiritual connection to their swords and when they died their swords were buried with them. Diodorus reports that the falcatas were of such superior quality that no helmet, shield or bone could resist its devastating effect. Gladius Hispaniensis References to the gladius hispaniensis are abundant in classical texts. During the Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the Romans experienced firsthand the effectiveness of this sword. In the beginning of the Roman presence on the peninsula during the Second Punic War, Roman legions came into contact with Iberian mercenaries, impressed with the technical and operational levels of their swords, they quickly adopted and began using Iberian swords. = Spears = Warriors from Iberia made extensive use of spears. The spear was used by all iberian tribes and was described by many different terms, indicating a vast variety of models. they would throw the javelins in volleys to disorganize the enemy formation before charging into close combat with swords. These warriors used the javelin with deadly accuracy. From modern archaeological research, there seems to have been an assortment of spears which have been classified into three groups: traditional and conventional spears of wooden shafts and metal heads, the all- iron type called soliferrum by the Romans, and Lances.  Falarica  Of all the conventional spears and javelins the Iberian people used, the Falarica was the most dreaded. Livy makes a reference to it when mentioning that the falarica was used by the iberians against the Carthaginians near Saguntum. The falarica was a javelin with a long iron pointed rod of about 90 cm (35 inches) in length with a short wooden handle. Although the iron spearhead was a thin rod, a section was thick, giving the weapon weight to further improve its ability to penetrate and making it an armour-piercing weapon. Several vase paintings show the use of javelin thongs, wound round the shaft to impart a stabilizing spin and additional thrust when it was thrown. This weapon was so feared that when it stuck into a shield without entering the body, it terrified the enemy. As well as being a throwing spear, it was also used as a ranged incendiary device: bundles of grass or packs filled with a combustible substance were bound to it and ignited. During sieges, the burning falarica was thrown against wooden palisades and thatched roofs to start fires and cause havoc. When the Iberians were besieged, they hurled flaming falaricas at the besiegers‚Äô siege engines. As an incendiary device, it had an enormous psychological effect, helping to spread fear among enemy troops. Soliferrum Iberian soliferreum from the Bastida de les Alcusses. Prehistory Museum of Valencia The soliferrum was an Iberian ranged pole weapon made entirely of iron. It was forged from a single piece of iron usually measuring between 1.5 to 2 meters in length and around 1 cm in diameter. Though slim, the central part was usually thickened to facilitate a hand‚Äôs grip. Sometimes there were mouldings of about 10 cm wide in the middle of the weapon to further improve grip and to prevent it from slipping because of sweaty hands. The soliferrum was an extremely effective heavy javelin. The weight and the density of its iron shaft, its small diameter and its narrow tip made the soliferrum an excellent armour-piercing weapon when it was thrown at close range, enabling it to further penetrate heavy shields and armour. Unlike the falarica, the soliferrum remained in use in the Iberian Peninsula under Roman rule until the end of the third century AD. Tragula In the collection at the Archaeological Museum of Zaragoza there is another type of throwing weapon which is rarely found, known as a tragula. The tip of this barbed spear came in several different forms. Usually it had only a sharpened tip with two or more small protruding spikes. This hybrid spear was something of a dart or arrow which was thrown from a long leather thong by which it was then recovered if possible. It proved to be dangerous to its user and deadly to its victim, for the barbed dart required to be cut out of its victim. Some minted Roman-Iberian coins bore on their reverse sides a military motif of a rider armed with a tragula.

Some 400 men of the 78th Highlanders regiment, together with their wives and children, embarked on Princess Charlotte on 18 September 1816 but a day later she hit a sunken rock. It was only with great difficulty that she returned to Batavia Roads.

On 5 November 1816 Frances Charlotte hit a sunken reef some 12 miles off Preparis. The ship's boats could only take about 150 people at a time, and a number of men remained marooned on the wreck and a nearby rock. On 9 November the merchant ship Po, Captain Knox, on her way to Penang from Madras, came by. She rescued 27 men (or 40) from the wreck, but then left after having lost a boat in a second attempt to bring of survivors, and with the weather worsening. Two men died in that attempt, and Po left behind her first mate. On 10 November, the merchant ship , Captain Weathrall, was sailing in the vicinity when she spied wreckage. Weathrall investigated and when he saw a signal fire stopped to render assistance. Between 11 and 14 November, Prince Blucher was able to rescue some 316 men, women, and children. She was able to rescue 110 of the 119 men that had remained on the rock after Po left, the remained having died. The weather and damage to Prince Blucher prevented her from rescuing another 90 Europeans and 40 lascars who remained on the island. After nine days Prince Blucher arrived at Bengal. The Government of Bengal then sent two cruisers that rescued the remaining survivors of the wreck. The last survivors had been marooned for some 36 days. By the time they were rescued, the survivors had run out of food and were too weak even to gather the few shellfish on the rocks at low tide. Some of the survivors died from privation shortly after finally being rescued, and some died from gorging themselves after having starved. By one report, 14 soldiers and two lascars had died in the loss of Frances Charlotte. At Calcutta, Weathrall and his men received great praise for their efforts. The Governor-General, on behalf of the government of Bengal, awarded Weathrall 5000 sicca rupees for plate. It also awarded money to his officers and crew. The merchants of Calcutta awarded Weathrall with an engraved silver plate.

With the description of P. matapalensis and other species since 2005, the total is now at least 20 species. P. matapalensis was described as the result of a taxonomic split in Heller's broad-nosed bat, with the \\"Eastern\\" populations retaining the name P. helleri, and the \\"Western\\" populations described as P. matapalensis. The holotype for the species was collected in July 1954 in Zarumilla, Peru by Peruvian ornithologist Celestino Kalinowski. Its species name matapalensis is derived from the Matapalo District, where the holotype was found. Description It is a small member of its genus, with a forearm length of . The fur on its back is light brown, with individual hairs tricolored. Dorsal hairs are long. The face is striped and the fur on its belly is brownish, with individual hairs bicolored or unicolored, depending on the individual. It has a narrow dorsal stripe down the length of its spine that is the same color as its facial stripes. Its nose-leaf is longer than it is wide. The margin of the uropatagium is densely furred with a fringe of hairs. Range and habitat It is known from the western slopes of the Andes in Ecuador and Peru. It may occur in northwest Colombia, though no records support this hypothesis yet. It prefers lowland forests that are undisturbed. It has been found at elevations of above sea level. Conservation It is currently evaluated as near-threatened by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this designation because its habitat is undergoing extensive losses in quality and extent. Its habitat loss has been so dramatic that the species is close to qualifying for vulnerable status.

He is most notable, however, for his chronicle (written in verse) that he wrote of his travels to England in 1399, where he was an eyewitness to the deposition of the King, Richard II. Although he seems to have visited for the purposes of \\"amusement and to see the country,\\" with a now unknown companion, he witnessed at first hand the events leading up to the deposition of King Richard II of England by his cousin Henry Bolingbroke. It has been described as the \\"fullest and most circumstantial\\" of the various contemporary narratives.  Travels with the King and deposition  Creton travelled to Ireland with the King on his expeditionary force in May 1399, but was sent back to Wales with the Earl of Salisbury two months later. Henry Bolingbroke and Richard II at Flint Castle; page from the illuminated manuscript of Creton's La Prinse et Mort du roy Richart (\\"The Capture and Death of King Richard\\"), Harleian Collection, in the British Library, once in the collection of Jean de Valois, Duc de Berry. Creton had deliberately joined Salisbury's retinue because of the earl's mighty chivalric reputation. The following month, August, saw the hurried return of the King from Ireland, alarmed at the news of Bolingbroke's landing at Ravenspur, Yorkshire, when he should have been in exile. Creton waited with the King at Conway Castle, and here he witnessed the Earl of Northumberland arrival and then that of Bolingbroke. Along with the other minor members of the royal entourage, Creton was required by the earl to leave the castle with Bolingbroke's herald. The chronicler was later open about the fact that, as a recent scholar has put it, Creton \\"was more frightened than he had ever been in his life.\\" However, on hearing that Creton and his companions were French, Bolingbroke addressed them in their own language and assured them of their personal safety. One modern English historian of the period has noted how, although Creton was clearly biased towards Richard- who had, after all, personally ensured that he was well looked after during his stay- Creton was still both willing and able to \\"give credit to Bolingbroke, for... his considerate treatment of the capture King\\" (and indeed towards himself). Creton noted that when Bolingbroke met Richard at Conway, it was an emotional encounter, with both being tearful and distressed.\\" The king surrendered himself to Lancaster. Following Bolingbroke's capture of the King, Creton secured an interview with him, at which, explaining their position as foreign visitors, he and his associate \\"pleaded for their lives.\\" Henry granted them their safety, but Creton tells how, being \\"sad and sick at heart,\\" it was then that they chose to return to France. He may however have witnessed Henry's coronation as King Henry IV, as he later described how- to his dissatisfaction- the crowds of London greeted the new King with as much rapture as if it had been Jesus entering the City.  The Metrical History  Creton's chronicle of events, whilst written with the benefit of hindsight, and containing many of the usual factual errors of detail and chronology, found in most works of the period, \\"provides, in essentials, a credible account\\" of this fast-moving period. Creton explains that he was moved to write his account at the urging of the Earl of Salisbury, who had been captured with Richard (and, indeed, was executed the following year). It was doubtless only the fact that Creton had returned to France prior to setting down his thoughts on paper- and thus \\"beyond the reach of Henry's heavy hand\\"- that he was able to do so unmolested. This took place sometime between November 1401 and March 1402. It was not unusual for him to decide to do so. In fact, a group of French chronicles of Richard's reign were produced in somewhat of a flurry around this time, due to the fact that in 1396 Richard had married the French King's daughter Isabella.Cr√©ton is notable for being one of the few contemporary chroniclers who believed Richard II was in fact alive after 1399- possibly, in fact, the only one. In his chronicle he says that, when Richard's body was displayed in St Paul's Cathedral in March 1400, he \\"certainly [did not] believe it was the old King,\\" and, further, that \\"I think it was [Richard] Maudelyn, his chaplain, whose face, size, height and build were so exactly similar to the King's.\\" He wrote as much to his own King, saying \\"the representation of [Richard's] image comes to me so often before the eyes of my heart, for by day and night all my mental imaginings\\" are solely about him. he later described weeping \\"tears of sympathy\\" for Richard. Believing Richard to still be alive, to this end, in April 1402, he travelled to Scotland, supposedly to meet with the King. However, soon he realised (\\"to his great disappointment\\") that the man he did meet with was in fact an imposter. He subsequently returned to France the same year to confirm Richard's supposedly violent death. Creton himself reports that after the Epiphany Rising, the deposed king was \\"so vexed at heart by this evil news that from that time onwards he neither ate nor drank and thus, so they say, it came to pass that he died.\\" He did not, however, report this while passing through England on his return to France.

The difference between them was the wing configuration, chosen to optimise their speed range for their role, so the P 6 was a biplane and the P 7 a parasol wing aircraft. Design and development After their first powered design, the single seat P 5, the Gabriel brothers considered the different requirements of two seat trainers and tourers. Both needed to handle well, ideally with similar characteristics, but the trainer required lower landing speeds and the tourer higher cruise speeds. They decided that economical solutions would share engines, fuselages, landing gears and wings but that the trainer should be a biplane with a cantilever lower wing and the tourer, without the lower wing, a parasol wing monoplane. The same airframe was flown in both the biplane (P 6) and parasol (P 7) configurations. Like the Gabriel P 5, the new aircraft was strongly influenced by the Fokker D.VII. The P 6 was an all wood aircraft. Both of its wings were tapered in plan and were built around two spars with plywood covering. The upper wing was mounted over the fuselage by a cabane of inverted V-struts from the upper fuselage and braced on each side with a parallel pair of struts from the spars to the lower longeron. The lower wing was attached to the lower longerons. The trainer was powered by a four cylinder, water-cooled inline Mercedes engine. The forward part of its rectangular section fuselage was covered with aluminium sheet and the rest with plywood. There were two cockpits in tandem, equipped with dual control though with flight instruments only in the rear seat. Its empennage was externally braced, with ply-covered fin and tailplane carrying fabric covered control surfaces. Its fixed landing gear, with a track of , was of the tailskid type, with mainwheels on a single axle held via rubber ring shock absorbers on V-struts from the lower longerons. The Gabriel P 6, the first Polish designed two seat trainer, was flown for the first time in late May 1924, piloted by Jan Gabriel at Bydgoszcz. It was subsequently tested by pilots from the Bydgoszcz pilot's school, who reported that it handled well. Later in 1924 the lower wing was removed, a straightforward alteration in the absence of interplane struts, and the aircraft was flown successfully as the Gabriel P 7. With only 63% of the P 6's wing area but slightly lighter the P 7 had both maximum and landing speeds that were faster than the P 6. The Polish aeronautical authorities showed no more interest in the P 6 and P 7 than they had in the P 5.

Political career In 2002 and 2006 he was elected a member of the Dnipropetrovsk City Council.

As head of the committee, he initiated a number of draft laws in the field of investment, banking, and financial sector. He was also a member of the groups on inter-parliamentary relations with the United States of America, the United Arab Emirates, China, Austria, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Uzbekistan. (Rybalka's) Radical Party lost all its parliamentary seats in the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election, because it gained about 1% to little to clear the 5% election threshold and also did not win an electoral district seat.CEC counts 100 percent of vote in Ukraine's parliamentary elections, Ukrinform (26 July 2019) Results of the extraordinary elections of the People's Deputies of Ukraine 2019, Ukrayinska Pravda (21 July 2019) Rybalka itself took part in the election as an independent candidate in constituency 107 in Luhansk Oblast.https://www.segodnya.ua/ua/vybory2019/kandidaty/luganska-oblast- candidates-num107-1298886.html Rybalka lost this election to Oleksandr Sukhov (who won with 28,96% of the votes). Activity in Financial Committee Serhii Rybalka chaired VR Financial Policy and Banking Committee based on political quota of the Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko, which was a part of democratic coalition until the autumn 2015. After withdrawal of the faction from the coalition, all faction members that chaired parliamentary committees turned in their resignations. These resignations, however, were not considered by the Regulatory Committee and the Verkhovna Rada for two years. As the chair of the financial policy and banking committee, Serhii Rybalka focused on the reforms in the banking sector. Specifically, under his leadership, a group of highly respected experts, employees of NBU, commercial banks, economists and scholars developed the Strategy of Banking Sector Development in Ukraine until 2020. This was the first time, when the parliamentary committee initiated its own strategy for a whole industry. The document was approved at the meeting of the committee and recommended for the introduction to the parliament and the government of Ukraine. The strategy provided an analysis of the operation of the National bank in relation to providing stability of the national currency ‚Äì hryvnia for the first time (which is its constitutional obligation), withdrawing problem banks from the market (in 2014‚Äì2017, over 90 banks, which is half of all banking institutions in the country, were withdrawn from the market). In addition, it provided analysis of the factors suppressing financing of the economy, absence of export support and the role of state banks in the financial system of Ukraine. The strategy proposed to increase transparency of NBU's operation, introduce instruments to encourage development of hi-tech productions, activate financing, increase liability for violating banking laws, in particular bankrupting a bank. Rybalka and experts also proposed to create a number of development institutes on the basis of state banks to support not only big businesses, but also small and medium enterprises, improve domestic demand, support exporters and develop hi-tech branches of production. With Serhii Rybalka as the chair of the committee, an open competition for the positions of members of the NBU Council, a supervisory constitutional body the controls how NBU exercises its authority, was introduced for the first time. Specifically, the committee reviewed programs of candidates from different political forces, before making a recommendation to the Verkhovna Rada on the candidates to be approved as the members of the NBU Council by the parliament's quota. Also, in 2014‚Äì2017, Rybalka and VR Committee on Financial Policy and Banking drafted and introduced to the Verkhovna Rada a number of draft laws aimed at reforming the financial sector. Specifically, these include draft laws on improving trust towards the banking system, on the deposit guarantee system for individuals, on supporting export, on minimum size of banks' capital, on credit register, on improving transparency of operation of the National Bank, on protection of rights of consumers of financial services, on stimulating financing in Ukraine. Implementation of a number of reforms, reflected in these draft laws, is a part of requirements of the International Monetary Fund within the package of the reforms that must be implemented in order to continue cooperation with Ukraine along with the demand to create anti-corruption court. In addition, under Rybalka's leadership, the Committee initiated the development of draft laws regulating circulation of cryptocurrency in Ukraine.[4] The draft law envisages introduction of instruments of protection of unqualified investors and also preferential conditions for development of blockchain infrastructure. However, the parliament's unwillingness to introduce financial reforms, including those initiated by the committee chaired by Rybalka, resulted into suspension of financial assistance to Ukraine from the international partners. Activity as a member of USA-Ukraine inter-parliamentary group Serhii Rybalka as the Chair of the VR Committee on Financial Policy and Banking and a member of the USA-Ukraine inter- parliamentary group regularly pays working visits to Washington. In 2017, he met with a number of chairs of committees of the US Congress, held a number of meetings at the IMF, IRI, Heritage Foundation. The issues discussed at the meetings included reforms progress in the sphere of finance and also law enforcement and judicial systems, U.S. experience in supporting small and medium enterprises as well as high level of political corruption in the contest of creating and organizing the work of the anti-corruption court. Persecution Since 2013 his family's business and Rybalka himself have been persecuted, they claim for his political activity. Specifically, the media reported the first searches in January 2014. Later, the family's company was accused of tax evasion, drug trade, illegal surveillance, fraud and many other crimes, every time none of these accusations were proven in court. Rybalka has claimed there have also been murder attempts against Rybalka and his close ally, S.Group top manager Serhiy Bilyy. One of the financial managers of the company Iryna Savytska is also being persecuted; in 2017 she was under arrest in Georgia on what she claimed were trumped-up charges of fraudulent actions. American media has written a lot about it. In an interview for The Washington Times a former employee of Prosecutor General of Ukraine Dmytro Sus claimed that PGO employees falsified cases against Rybalka and company. Hennadii Butkevych could have been behind these falsified cases, said Sus. In 2017 the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine initiated a criminal proceedings regarding these facts.

At school he had no particular academic or sporting distinction but sang in the choir and played violin in the orchestra. He also played the piano and, at some stage, he changed to the double bass.Kelly Chapter 2 Professional career Rodewald started his career as a clerk with a London bank, but soon joined his father's firm of Rodewald & Co in Liverpool. This firm seems to have traded cotton and other merchandise from America. His elder brother John Ferdinand Byrne Rodewald (1856-1891) also joined the firm from America, allowing the father to retire to London. Unfortunately he died suddenly in 1891 leaving Alfred to take over the business at age 29. The cotton trade was a big industry at that time, being imported from America to Liverpool and then traded to the mills in Manchester and other Lancashire towns via rail and the Manchester Ship Canal. Alfred was elected to the board of The Liverpool Cotton Association (now the International Cotton Association) but resigned after only a few weeks (for reasons unknown). The cotton trade had numerous setbacks during Rodewald's time which must have made his life stressful and may have affected his health. He had other business interests being a director of the North British and Mercantile Insurance and Secretary of the Bimetallist Society (see Bimetalism).Kelly Chapter 3 Musical career Little is known of Rodewald's musical education and he was probably mostly self-taught after leaving school, but during his time in Germany he may have come under the influence of his uncle Herman George Rodewald (1815-1891) who, after a successful business career in South America retired back to Bremen in 1858 to devote himself to music.Kelly p 11 and Rohdewald, Wolfgang web page for Herman George Rodewald (1815-1891) He played the double bass in the Lower Rhine Music Festival (Niederrheinisches Musikfest) and it was here that he first met the conductor, Hans Richter,Kelly p 12 (Director of the Festival 1877 and 1878) who became a lifelong friend. In 1884 Rodewald joined Father James Nugent‚Äôs Liverpool Peoples‚Äô Orchestra as a double bass playerKelly p 22 and Bowden who suggests that Rodewald actually founded he The Peoples Orchestra and had taken over the role of conductor by 1886.Kelly p 25; Bowden and Benas p 106 He developed this orchestra to a high standard and reformed it in 1890 as the Liverpool Orchestral Society Kelly p 27; Bowden and Benas p 104 which eventually became a large semi-professional orchestra, well respected throughout the country. As well as conducting and playing the double bass (in other orchestras), he gave regular lectures on musicKelly pp 27 & 30 in the Rotunda (later known as Picton Hall and now part of the Liverpool Central Library). In 1900 Rodewald took over the conductorship of the New Brighton Tower Orchestra on Granville Bantock‚Äôs appointment as Principal of the new school of music at the Birmingham Midland InstituteKelly p 61 (now the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire). He was a great admirer of Wagner and a champion of the modern composers of his day, such as Tchaikovsky, Antonin Dvorak and Richard Strauss and in particular British composers such as Alexander Mackenzie and Hamish MacCunn as well as Elgar, Granville Bantock and Charles Villiers Stanford. Granville Bantock introduced Rodewald to Edward Elgar and they became very close friends.Kelly pp 57 & 133 Elgar conducted the first performance of his first two Pomp and Circumstance Marches at a concert given by the Liverpool Orchestral Society in the old Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool. No 1 (which became ‚ÄòLand of Hope and Glory‚Äô) was dedicated to Rodewald and the Liverpool Orchestral Society and No 2 was dedicated to Bantock.Kelly pp 70-71 (n.b. The venue was the Philharmonic Hall, not St George‚Äôs Hall) Rodewald was also a close friend of Hans Richter,Kelly p 43 the Hall√© Orchestra‚Äôs Austrian conductor and it is said that he was Richter‚Äôs only conducting pupil.Kelly p 44 Elgar was devastated by Rodewald‚Äôs sudden death. Having reached Liverpool just too late to see him, he wandered the street in a daze.Kelly Chapter 14 Richter took over the concert being prepared by Rodewald at the time of his death, as a memorial concert following his sudden demise.Liverpool Orchestral Society programme, 5 December 1903; Kelly p 127 In 1911 a group of friends founded the Rodewald Concert Club, later renamed the Rodewald Concert Society, in his memory with the support of the composer, Charles Villiers Stanford (elected as the first President) and famous baritone, Harry Plunket Greene.Rodewald Concert Society archives, minute book 1911-1936 Ref 780 RCS/1/1/1; Kelly p 128 and Henley & McKernan p 81 On Stanford‚Äôs death, Elgar was invited to become the President of the Society. However, he declined in an infamous letter saying that orchestral concerts should have been maintained as Rodewald‚Äôs memorial and that chamber music was inadequate.

He was the son of Samuel Untermyer, another notable New York attorney who is best remembered for his opposition to Adolf Hitler and for creating \\"America's Greatest Forgotten Garden\\" in Yonkers, New York. Irwin was also the father of Samuel Untermyer II, a notable nuclear scientist. Legal career Irwin Untermyer graduated from Columbia University in 1907 and Columbia Law School in 1910. Following graduation, Untermyer proceeded to his father's law firm, Guggenheimer, Untermyer & Marshall, where he became partner. \\"It has rarely fallen to the lot of those elected to the bench to have enjoyed the rich experience of Mr. Untermyer,\\" wrote Louis Marshall in The New York Times. Along with his father, Untermyer also served as volunteer special counsel for the city's Transit Commission. As a result, he had to make oral arguments before the United States Supreme Court in Gilchrist v. Interborough Rapid Transit Company. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company wanted to raise the New York City Subway's five-cent fare, and the city was suing to prevent that. Irwin's father was originally scheduled to represent the city, but when he fell ill Irwin argued before Chief Justice Taft and his fellow justices for nearly two hours. \\"There were only three interruptions, two of them being requests for page numbers in the brief\\", The New York Times wrote. The Court held in favor of the City. \\"I am very happy to hear of the decision\\", then- Congressman Fiorello La Guardia stated, calling Untermyer's argument a \\"splendid and merited rebuke to the judges who lost their heads in New York and signed the order.\\" Untermyer was elected to the New York Supreme Court, the trial court of New York State, in 1929 with the backing of Tammany Hall mayor Jimmy Walker. In 1933, Governor Herbert H. Lehman designated Untermyer as a justice of the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, First Judicial Department, where he served alongside Justices that included Roy Cohn‚Äôs father Albert until Untermyer's retirement in August 1945. Although long active in Democratic Party politics, Untermyer received the endorsement of all political parties during his reelection bid in 1943. Metropolitan Museum of Art Though he followed in his father Samuel's legal footsteps, Irwin did not share his father's passion for promoting public horticulture at Untermyer Park in Westchester County, New York. \\"Mr. Untermyer‚Äôs sons, Alvin Untermyer and Judge Irwin Untermyer, have not inherited their father‚Äôs costly passion for home-grown orchid boutonnieres, hothouse figs, nectarines, etc,\\" wrote The New Yorker in 1940. Instead, Untermyer became known as an avid collector and promoter of art and antiquities. Untermyer donated extensively to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and maintained a lifelong association with the museum. He served on the Board of Trustees for 20 years, and bequeathed over 2,000 pieces from his collection upon his death. Pieces donated by Untermyer constitute \\"one of the world's great private collections\\" and are on permanent display in the museum. Untermyer's collection in the Metropolitan Museum is mentioned in E. L. Konigsburg's 1967 book From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. While living at the Met, the Kincaid siblings sleep in an antique four-poster bed from the Irwin Untermyer collection. \\"I once considered donating [the museum] my bed,\\" says the book's narrator, Mrs. Frankweiler, \\"but Mr. Untermyer gave them this one first.\\" Private life Untermyer married Louise A. Feuchtwanger on February 15, 1912 at the St. Regis New York. The couple had three children, Joan Untermyer Erdmann, Samuel Untermyer II, and Frank Untermyer. Irwin Untermyer died on October 18, 1973 at the age of 87.

The eastern slopes descend steeply to the Bayuvi Dupki Cirque, while the western slopes face the valley of the Vlahina river. A tourist eco-path traverses the western slope. The northern face is popular with climbers. The peak is built up of karstified marbles. The summit accommodates many rare herbaceous plants, including edelweiss (Leontopodium nivale) and the only locality of Euphrasia drosocalyx in the Balkan Peninsula. Bayuvi Dupki has three distinct peak points; the main elevation being the southern one. The rocky karst ridge Sredonosa takes its beginning at the north-eastern point. The main crest between the three points may be as narrow as 50 cm. The eastern slopes facing the homonymous cirque are vertical and inaccessible. The western slopes are heavily inclined to the valley of the Vlahina river. At 470 m to the south-east of the summit on the main ridge is situated the highest alpine shelter in Bulgaria ‚Äî Koncheto.

Harun was also faced with the political ambitions of the powerful governors Ahmad ibn Tulun of Egypt and 'Amr ibn al-Layth of Sijistan, who both sought to increase their prestige by gaining guardianship over the Holy City.

Her philanthropic activities included the establishment of the Strong-Carter Dental Clinic at Palama Settlement in Hawaii, and the Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York. Personal life She was born in Rochester, New York on March 11, 1866, to the co-founder and first president of Eastman Kodak, Henry A. Strong (1838‚Äì1919) and his first wife Helen Phoebe Griffin (1839‚Äì1904). The family had one daughter besides Helen, Gertrude Strong Achilles, and two sons Henry Griffin Strong and Herbert Strong who died in infancy. On April 19, 1892, she married George R. Carter in Rochester, the son of Hawaii diplomat Henry A. P. Carter. The couple returned to live in Hawaii in 1893, and had three daughters and one son: Elizabeth, Phoebe, another daughter who died in 1903, and George Robert, Jr. Her husband was appointed the second Territorial Governor of Hawaii for the term November 23, 1903 ‚Äì August 15, 1907. Governor Carter died in 1933, and Helen remarried to Jean de Saint Cyr in April 1939. They divorced in 1940, and she resumed using the Carter name. Philanthropies The dental hygiene program at the University of Hawaii, and the Honolulu Dental Infirmary, with her husband George as president, were established with endowments from Helen in memory of her parents. Both Helen and her husband served on the board of directors. In addition to providing dental care and dental hygiene education to the public, the School of Dental Hygiene was established to train young women for careers as dental hygienists. The school was opened in 1920 at Palama Settlement in the Kalihi area, and the first year focused on 1st and 2nd grade students. The first meeting of the board of directors in July 1921 reported that, with the clinic only open one day a week with a hygienist and dentist, they had treated 1168 patients. The clinic was later renamed as the Strong-Carter Dental Clinic. On the 20th anniversary of the clinic, her generosity in establishing the clinic was honored by 20,000 children at Honolulu Stadium. The festivities included a performance by the Royal Hawaiian Band and the President William McKinley High School Reserve Officers' Training Corps. In 1922, Helen and her sister Gertrude were the only two members of their immediate family remaining when they honored their parents with a $1,000,000 donation towards the building fund for the Strong Memorial Hospital at the University of Rochester in New York. Their donation was part of a total of $15,091,671 in individual gifts for the construction. Death Helen Strong Carter died in California on May 28, 1945.

Characters  Dawn Midnight: \\"Office Lesbian\\".Five Lesbian Brothers. The Secretaries. Samuel French acting ed., New York, Samuel French, 2010. While Dawn is billed as the \\"Office Lesbian\\", she is in reality just the only fully out lesbian. Over the course of the play, most of the female characters prove interested in or at least willing to participate in sexual activities with other women. Ashley Elizabeth Fratangelo: \\"Susan's Sycophant, Bulimic\\". Longstanding Secretary of the month. Patty Johnson: \\"The New girl\\". New secretary to be inducted into the cult. Susan Curtis: \\"Office manager/ Cult Leader\\". Peaches Martin: \\"Sweet, clueless, slow-moving target\\". Secretary. Buzz Benikee: \\"sensitive lumberjack\\". Also Patty's male love interest. Hank and Sandy: \\"Sexually harassing lumberjacks (slow)\\". Mr. Ron Kembunkscher: \\"the boss\\". Owner of Cooney Lumber Mill in Big Bone, Oregon.  Plot Summary  This satirical play opens with a rhyming prolog recited in unison by Dawn, Ashley, Peaches, and Patty. They explain that they are part of a cult that, once a month, gathers to murder one of the lumberjacks employed by the logging mill they work for, and blame it on a logging accident. Scene one starts on the day Patty is promoted from being a receptionist to a secretary and starts on her path to join the cult, referred to in more public circles as the Big Bone Women's Association. Patty quickly learns that the office hierarchy circles around whoever currently holds the award of secretary of the month, an award that it seems is best won by being sexually pliable towards Susan, the office manager, and by maintaining an unrealistically thin figure. As Patty works her way into the tightly knit clique of secretaries, she is introduced to some of the strange rituals and rules practiced by their cult. At the first meeting she attends, she is puzzled as to why Susan collects the women's used tampons, and why she is required to sign a pledge of celibacy to join. Despite signing the pledge, Patty quickly finds herself in a sexual relationship with Buzz, one of the company lumberjacks, and shortly after, she also hooks up with Dawn, the \\"Office Lesbian\\". Despite Patty's pleading, neither secret remain so for long; soon the entire office knows. As the end of the month approaches, Patty becomes stressed as she watches Susan and the rest of the secretaries become more and more manic. Susan starts drinking and driving, Peaches begins to binge eat, Dawn becomes more sexually aggressive, and Ashley becomes violently jealous over the fact that Patty wins secretary of the month. On the last night of the month, Susan gathers the secretaries in the woods to kill a lumberjack, in this case, Buzz, and to steal his jacket for Patty, the newest member of the cult, to wear. While Patty resists at first, she quickly breaks down and admits that she wants to join in with the plan. After the women take turns chain sawing Buzz to death, the play ends with another short and chilling rhyme: \\"Patty's got her jacket now. She fits in with the rest. She cut her boyfriend into bits, and so she passed the test. Save? No. We‚Äôre way beyond saving. We‚Äôre at the end. We should provide a moral for this story, but this is not a moral tale or complex allegory. No, we prefer you think of this as purely cautionary. Remember, sitting next to you could be a secretary!\\".  Reception  The Secretaries was widely reviewed upon opening as more comical than it was meaningful. James Hannaham of The Village Voice wrote, \\"The Secretaries [is] funnier than it is plot-driven and potentially taxing at an hour and a half\\".\\"Cameos: The Secretaries.\\" The Village Voice, 4 Oct. 1994, p. 100. Ben Brantley of The New York Times described The Secretaries as a \\"sometimes very funny, exercise in subverting American images of womanhood\\" that \\"plays on anxious male fantasies of what women do when they‚Äôre alone together; straight women's fantasies of lesbians (they're predatory)\\". Reviewers also agreed that the show was too long for a plot that is forecast from the opening scene: \\"What [Director Kate Stafford] doesn‚Äôt do is edit‚Ä¶the last half hour of the play drags, in part because the climax has been foretold but mostly because of repetition\\". While the show was not without its critiques, most reviewers also noted that the show had an enthusiastic audience: \\"Judging from the exultantly knowing audience reactions the night I saw the play, this cult of man-sawing office girls seems destined to find a cult of its own\\".

Certified in Ukraine as a dietary supplement, bemethyl is commonly used in preparing for international competitions by Ukrainian national sport teams. Bemethyl is formulated as a hydrobromide salt. Its parent compound is 2-ethylsulfanyl-1H-benzimidazole. Medical uses Effects and benefits Bemethyl is primarily classified as an actoprotector; a synthetic adaptogen with significant capacity to increase physical performance. Bemethyl also has a positive effect on metabolic processes, allowing adaptation to conditions causing frequent hypoxia, and the obtained effect is long-lasting and also occurs after the end of dosage. Bemethyl has been shown to preserve both physical and mental capacity in high- altitude, low-oxygen environments, particularly by its effect in helping control excess serum levels of cholesterol and bilirubin, which are known to have negative effects especially during adjustment to high-altitude environments. Bemethyl has also been shown to prevent permanent hearing loss and facilitate recovery of hearing after mine-explosion trauma, when treatment is initiated immediately after injury. Clinical research =Anti- mutagenic= In one study, bemethyl was shown to prevent the mutagenic effect of white asbestos in mice and in cultured human whole blood. A study using mice showed bemethyl to reduce mutatation induced by certain mutagenic drugs. Another study using cells from human donors showed Bemethyl to be anticlastogenic (able to minimize chromosome breakages). Pharmacology Pharmacokinetics Bemethyl resists metabolization and is long-lived, accumulating in tissues over course of treatment. In one study involving rats, long-term administration of Bemethyl was accompanied by a 1.38-fold increase in drug concentration in the brain, and a 1.68-fold increase in its concentration in skeletal muscles. History Bemethyl was developed in the 1970s by the Department of Pharmacology of the St. Petersburg State Military Medical Academy under the direction of Professor Vladimir Vinogradov. Professor Vinogradov and his research team earned the USSR State Prize for this accomplishment. First used with Soviet cosmonauts, Bemethyl was also used to prepare athletes of the USSR national team for the Moscow 1980 Olympic Games. In the 1990s, bemethyl saw use as a basic medicinal agent in many of the corps of the Soviet and Russian armies, including Soviet troops in Afghanistan, as bemethyl facilitated increased endurance for soldiers over long marches, as well as an enhanced work capacity and stability to hypoxia and high temperatures. Bemethyl was also used to enhance the physical and mental capacities of workers deployed in the wake of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Legal As of 2018, bemethyl is now placed on the 2018 Monitoring Program of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency to evaluate misuse in sport.

It traced its lineage back to the 351st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, formed before World War II to provided air defense for Leningrad. For its actions in the Siege of Leningrad, the 351st was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. It became the 72nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Brigade in 1944 and the 967th Anti- Aircraft Artillery Regiment in 1945. In 1961, the regiment became the 967th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment with S-125 missiles. It relocated to Tikhvin in 1968, equipped with the S-200V. It was disbanded in 1993 as a result of the introduction of the more modern S-300PS in the Leningrad air defense system.  History  The 351st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment was formed in late 1940, covering the northern air defense sector of Leningrad. During the Siege of Leningrad in World War II, the regiment defended the city against air attack. During a 5 April raid, gunner Bespalov of Senior Lieutenant P.A. Kaplar claimed a Junkers Ju 88 downed. On 4 October, Senior Sergeant B.S. Alymov's crew claimed three enemy aircraft downed during the Sinyavino Offensive. Between 26 September and 6 October of that year, the 189th and 351st Regiments claimed 40 enemy aircraft downed combined. In January 1943, the regiment covered ground troops during Operation Iskra. For its actions, the regiment's 3rd Battalion was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 14 February, and the 351st was awarded the same decoration on 9 February 1944. In May of that year, the regiment became the 72nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Brigade. In the fall of 1945, the brigade became the 967th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, equipped with medium caliber anti-aircraft guns. Until the late 1950s, the 967th was stationed in the Rzhevka area of Leningrad. An S-200V of the type operated by the regiment In accordance with a directive of 23 January 1961, the regiment was redesignated as the 967th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment, one of three regiments of the 6th Independent Air Defense Army that included six battalions of S-125 missiles, designed to target low- altitude, maneuverable aircraft. The 967th was based at Tamengont near Lomonosov on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland. By a directive of 24 January 1968, a school for training junior specialists of air defense was formed in Tamengont, and the regiment was transferred to Tikhvin and reequipped with long-range S-200 missiles. The 967th included three S-200V battalions, positioned near Kayvaksa. In 1986, the regiment became part of the 54th Air Defense Corps. After the more modern S-300PS was introduced into the Leningrad air defense system, the S-200V units were gradually phased out, and the regiment was disbanded in 1993.

She served as Premi√®re dame d'honneur to the queen of France, Anne of Austria, from 1615 until 1618. Appointment In√©s de la Torre was a daughter of Juan de Saavedra el Turquillo and Francisca Enr√≠quez de Sandoval, and a cousin to the influential favorite of Philip III of Spain, Francisco G√≥mez de Sandoval, 1st Duke of Lerma. She was heiress of the house of Saavedra. She married Per Af√°n de Ribera y Guzm√°n, se√±or de la Torre de la Reina. In√©s de la Torre served as lady-in-waiting to the queen, Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain. As a widow, she was created the first Countess de la Torre by the king. In 1615, was appointed head of the ladies-in-waiting of Anne of Austria prior to her departure from Spain to her wedding to Louis XIII of France. In an effort to retain their influence upon Anne in France, king Philip III and the Duke of Lerma appointed people they regarded a loyal to themselves to the offices of the household that was to accompany her to France, and as cousin to the duke of Lerma, In√©s de la Torre, was given the highest position and expected to protect the interests of Spain at the French court.Akkerman , Nadine; Houben, Birgit, eds.

She was instructed by the Spanish king to make sure that Anne retained her life rules in France, and she was also to give him regular reports of his daughters doings.Kleinman, Ruth: Anne of Austria. Queen of France. . Ohio State University Press (1985) France When Anne arrived at the French royal court in Paris, a dilemma occurred, as she was given a new household composed of Frenchmen upon her arrival, but did not wish to dismiss her Spanish retinue. A compromise was met where she was allowed to keep both households. This resulted in a situation where several offices at her court was split, and the post of Premi√®re dame d'honneur was consequently shared by In√©s de la Torre and her French counterpart Laurence de Montmorency, just as the second rank office of Dame d'atour was shared between the Spanish Luisa de Osorio and her French counterpart Antoinette d'Albert de Luynes. In√©s de la Torre had a powerful influence over queen Anne. The double court of queen Anne was not popular, as it caused jealousy and rivalry at court because of the queen's preference of her Spanish retinue, and she was accused of isolating herself with her Spanish ladies-in-waiting and of retaining her Spanish customs, which prevented her form adjusting to France and was regarded to have contributed to the difficulty of developing a relationship to the king, Louis XIII. This situation was not changed by the queen mother regent, however, who remained queen and first lady at court, and preferred the self-imposed isolation of queen Anne. Dismissal In 1617, the regency government of Maria de' Medici fell and its leading figures, her favorites Concino Concini and Leonora Dori, was ousted from power by help of Charles d'Albert, duc de Luynes. de Luynes also took upon himself to adjust the organisation of the royal household and replaced all the Spanish ladies- in-waiting of Anne with French ones: the process was completed in Winter of 1618-1619, when all that remained of Anne's Spanish retinue was her Spanish confessor and one chamber woman. It was discovered in connection to this that In√©s de la Torre had used her position to embezzle huge sums of money intended for the expenses of the queen's household.Akkerman , Nadine; Houben, Birgit, eds. (2014). The Politics of Female Households: Ladies-in-waiting across Early Modern Europe. Brill. It was also known that she had co-operated closely with the Spanish ambassador to France, Hector de Pignatelli y Colonna, duke of Monteleon, giving him regular reports and in fact acting as a spy.Akkerman , Nadine; Houben, Birgit, eds. (2014). The Politics of Female Households: Ladies-in-waiting across Early Modern Europe. Brill. She was exiled from France and returned to Spain. The loss of In√©s de la Torre caused her to be replaced as the queen's favorite by Marie de Rohan who (supported by the duke de Luynes) introduced Anne to French fashion and customs and managed to effect an (if temporary) closer relation between the king and queen, but also in time became a much controversial favorite.

It does not include particulate matter from other common sources, such as vehicle exhaust or smokestacks. Fugitive dust particles are mainly minerals common to soil, including silicon oxides, aluminium, calcium, and iron. About half of fugitive dust particles are larger than 10 microns in diameter and settle more quickly than the smaller particles. The term is used to denote that the dust \\"escapes\\" into the atmosphere rather than being exhausted in a \\"confined flow stream\\" from a \\"ducted emitter\\" (an exhaust pipe or chimney). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that fugitive dust was responsible for 92% of the PM-10 emissions in the United States in 1995. Sources Fugitive dust from military helicopters Fugitive dust from construction in a city Fugitive dust from agriculture Fugitive dust results from dry conditions where there is insufficient moisture content in the ground to hold the soil together. Particulate matter (PM) then enters the atmosphere through the action of wind, vehicular movement, or other activities. Areas with dry or desert climates, especially when combined with high winds, have more severe problems of fugitive dust. Dry and disturbed surfaces can release wind-borne fugitive dust for many months before there is sufficient rainfall to coagulate the soil. Surfaces susceptible to fugitive dust emissions are both natural and man-made. Specific sources include open fields and parking lots, paved and unpaved roads, agricultural fields, construction sites, unenclosed storage piles, and material transfer systems. Surface mining operations are also sources of fugitive dust as a result of many mining operations including haul roads, tailing piles, drilling, blasting, the removal of overburden and the actual mineral extraction. In 1995, 28 percent of fugitive dust in the US originated from unpaved roads, 23 percent from construction sites, 19 percent agricultural, 15 percent from paved roads, 5 percent from wind erosion, 1 percent from mining according to the EPA. Effects The inhalation of PM by people introduces it into the lungs where it can cause respiratory illnesses, permanent lung damage, and in some individuals premature death. PM with diameters of ‚â§10 micrometers (PM10) can harm human health, with particles of ‚â§2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) being the worst. As wind-borne dust can easily migrate, respiratory irritation can occur in construction and agricultural workers close to a source as well as others including wildlife. In addition to adverse health affects, the abrasive nature of particulate matter can cause property damage and obscure visibility leading to vehicular collisions causing injury and death. Fugitive dust can also harm plant life. In 1999, the National Park Service found that lichen and other non-vascular plants in the Cape Krusenstern National Monument in Alaska were affected due to dust generated from hauling ore from the Red Dog mine along a road within the monument. A follow-up study in 2006 found slightly elevated levels of lead and cadmium concentrations in small birds and voles captured along the road. A lawsuit in 2011 filed by 150 Waimea, Hawaii residents alleges that their homes were subjected, \\"on almost a daily basis\\", to blown \\"pesticide-laden fugitive dust\\". The residents claimed their homes sustained physical damage and they were forced to live with their windows closed year-round. They were seeking monetary damages from DuPont Pioneer to compensate for the reduced value of their homes and suggested future lawsuits would address health issues. A 2017 lawsuit in Maryland claims that fugitive dust from a -high pile of coal dust at a coal processing plant has caused \\"extensive damage\\" through erosion to blades on wind turbines in a nearby wind farm. Measurement One of the first methods of measuring fugitive dust was developed in the 1970s and used isokinetic dust samplers. At least six samplers were needed downstream of a dust source. Exposure profiling was developed later and used in the 1980s and 1990s. Later improvements use time-resolved dust monitors to isolate short- term dust releases. New methods include Optical Remote Sensing which uses an open path laser transmissometer used with time-resolved dust monitors and other wind monitors. Prevention Various methods are employed to minimize fugitive dust. In agricultural settings, bare soil can be covered with crop residue or planted with cover crops between seasons. Dirt roads can be sprayed with water to contain dust, or stabilized with chemicals that form hard surface crusts, or paved with aggregate or a hard surface. In windy areas, wind barriers including fences or vegetation can reduce wind speed and trap larger particles already in the air. Irrigation can be used to keep soil moist between natural rainfalls. Fugitive dust can be controlled by the application of various chemical suppressants including lignin sulfonates, petroleum resins, latexes, salts, plastics, and wetting agents. Coal dust piles have been treated with water or other chemical surfactants to suppress dust until the moisture evaporates. Other chemicals can provide protection for up to six months. Wind fences of polyester fabric can also be used to slow wind movement and minimize fugitive dust. Regulation The US state of Arizona has an Agricultural Dust Program with compliance officers that inspect agricultural operations and investigate dust complaints. All farms in the state must take \\"reasonable precautions\\" to \\"minimize\\" the emission of fugitive dust. More stringent procedures must be followed in areas that don't meet Federal air quality standards. The US Federal Environmental Protection Agency has specific standards for daily average particulate matter originating from active mines. Finer particulates have been detected up to from mining operations. Other types Dust emitted from processing equipment that may not contain typical soil components is also considered fugitive dust. In this context, fugitive dust is dust that has \\"escaped\\" during any mechanical process and entered the atmosphere. Fugitive dust emissions within a structure can not only cause respiratory problems but, when generated during the processing of combustible materials, can cause fire and blast damage if ignited. Fugitive dust acquires an electronic charge when dispersed in the air. Spraying an oppositely charged water fog can be used to effectively control dust in an industrial setting. If so charged, less water is needed to cause the particulate matter to drop from the air. This method has been tested with many materials including silica flour, sulfur dioxide, and fly ash.

The Cadaver Tomb of Ren√© of Chalon (, also known as the Memorial to the Heart of Ren√© de Chalon or The Skeleton) is a late Gothic period funerary monument, known as a transi, in the church of Saint- √âtienne at Bar-le-Duc, in northeastern France. It consists of an altarpiece and a limestone statue of a putrefied and skinless corpse which stands upright and extends his left hand outwards. Completed sometime between 1544 and 1557, the majority of its construction is attributed to the French sculptor Ligier Richier. Other elements, including the coat of arms and funeral drapery, were added in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively. The tomb dates from a period of societal anxiety over death, as plague, war and religious conflicts ravaged Europe. It was commissioned as the resting place of Ren√© of Chalon, Prince of Orange, son-in-law of Duke Antoine of Lorraine. Ren√© was killed aged 25 at the siege of St. Dizier on 15 July 1544, from a wound sustained in battle the previous day. Richier presents him as an √©corch√©, with his skin and muscles decayed, leaving him reduced to a skeleton. This apparently fulfilled his deathbed wish that his tomb depict his body as it would be three years after his death. His left arm is raised as if gesturing towards heaven. Supposedly, at one time his heart was held in a reliquary placed in the hand of the figure's raised arm. Unusually for contemporaneous objects of this type, his skeleton is standing, making it a \\"living corpse\\", an innovation that was to become highly influential. The tomb effigy is positioned above the carved marble and limestone altarpiece. Designated a Monument historique on 18 June 1898, the tomb was moved for safekeeping to the Panth√©on in Paris during the First World War, before being returned to Bar-le-Duc in 1920. Both the statue and altarpiece underwent extensive restoration between 1998 and 2003. Replicas of the statue are in the Mus√©e Barrois in Bar-le-Duc and the Palais de Chaillot, Paris. Description Statue The statue is 177 cm (70 in) in height, and made from black marble and limestone.

The art historian Kathleen Cohen writes that the monument may be an illustration of the \\"doctrine of corruption as a necessary step toward regeneration\\". Ren√©'s outstretched hand was stolen by a French soldier in 1793. It was later replaced, but shown holding either a clepsydra or hourglass, obvious symbolic objects for a memento mori. However, that placement changed the meaning of the sculpture, from a representation of Ren√© to a depiction of the personification of death or as a danse macabre.Kuyper (2004), p. 130Cohen (1973), p. 178 Death of Ren√© of Chalon Ren√© of Chalon, Prince of Orange and stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht and Gelre, died on 15 July 1544, aged 25, during the siege of St. Dizier where he fought for Emperor Charles V. Ren√© had been mortally wounded in battle the previous day, and died with the Emperor in attendance at his bedside.Rowen (1988), p. 11 He died without leaving any direct descendants. Charles wrote soon after to Ren√©'s wife, Anna of Lorraine (d. 1568), setting out in detail the circumstances of Ren√©'s last hours and death.Cohen (1973), p. 177 The monument apparently fulfills his wish that he be represented above this tomb as an √©corch√©, that is a body without skin, and \\"as he would be three years after his death\\".Chastel (1995), p. 218 Cadaver monuments had been built for other members of the family, including his father Henry III of Nassau-Breda, his uncle Philibert of Chalon,Cohen (1968), p. 342 his grandmother, and the uncle of his wife.Cohen (1973), pp. 177‚Äì78 Ren√© requested that his tomb present him \\"not as a standard figure but a life-size skeleton with strips of dried skin flapping over a hollow carcass, whose right hand clutches at the empty rib cage while the left hand holds high his heart in a grand gesture\\".Thuillier (2003), p. 216 alt=Painting of Ren√© of Chalon, shown half-length, in profile, facing right.

Given this lack of record and that, at only 25 years, Ren√© was unlikely to have previously thought closely about his own burial and memorial, it seems most likely that the idea behind the design came from Anna. She is known to have commissioned the piece from Ligier Richier, who was then little known outside his local area of Saint-Mihiel in north-eastern France, but is today considered one of the most important sculptors of the late Gothic period.Manca et al (2016), p. 513No√´l; Chon√© (2000), p. 7 Although the precise dating is uncertain, it is known to have begun after 1544 and was completed before 1557.

The mural on the wall behind the statue was painted by Varembel Barber in 1790. Interpretation Cadaver monuments, in France known as transis, were intended to show the human body's \\"transition\\" from life to decomposition. Art historians debate this particular example's meaning, specifically the symbolism of the raised hand and what it originally held. At one time, the raised hand is supposed to have contained the prince's actual dried heart. The effigy is viewed by art historians in two distinct ways. The more literal interpretation is that the tomb is a dedication commissioned by a loving and pious wife. Other scholars, including Bernard No√´l and Paulette Chon√©, read deeper meaning, and invoking a sense of the \\"spirituality of death\\",No√´l; Chon√© (2000), p. 43 view the work as a comment on both the inevitability and effect of death. These opposing interpretations were juxtaposed in 1922 by the novelist Louis Bertrand when he wrote that the tomb may represent either despair or a romantic ideal of the eternal spirit.No√´l; Chon√© (2000), p. 41 A further interpretation is that the work represents a mark of penance or repentance of past sins. Legacy alt=Replica of the skeleton before a stone wall and domed window A copy of the cadaver for the Palais de Chaillot was produced in 1894.

Provenance and conservation The tomb was originally placed in the collegiate church of Saint-Maxe in Bar-le- Duc, where it was positioned over a vault which may have held the hearts of Ren√©, his father-in-law Antoine, Duke of Lorraine, and other members of his family. It was moved to the church of St ƒñtienne in 1782 when the former site was abandoned. It was moved to the Panth√©on in Paris during the First World War and was returned to Bar-le-Duc in 1920. Due to humidity and contact with water, the tomb has suffered damage over the centuries. It was restored in 1969 by Maxime Chiquet d'Allancancelles. Both the statue and altarpiece underwent further restoration between 1998 and 2003. In 1993 both the retable and the tomb were classified as historic monuments, and underwent restoration. An extensive assessment and historical study commissioned by the Direction r√©gionale des affaires culturelles in 1998 was followed by a condition assessment and recommendations in 2001. The 2003 restoration was conducted in stages, beginning with the dismantling of the statue which was painstakingly cleaned with cotton buds, before the altar was dismantled to clean its back wall. Microcrystalline cellulose wax was used to polish both the back wall and side columns. The restorer Fran√ßoise Joseph cleaned the mural, brightening the colours, and during the process discovered decorations at each of its four corners. Because the church's basement is often water-logged in winter, the mural had been damaged by humidity. Repairs to the statue included the removal of wrinkles, splinters, cracks, and graffiti; much of the work centered on areas around the groin, knee and pelvis. The iron fasteners were removed and replaced with stainless steel studs, removing the future risk of oxidation.

He played college football at Mississippi State. Early life After playing at Mendenhall High School in Mississippi, Rankin spent two years at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College in Perkinston, Mississippi. He was rated as the ninth best junior college recruit by 247 Sports and committed to play at Mississippi State over offers from Oklahoma, Florida, Louisville, Missouri, Ohio State, Ole Miss, Texas, and others. College career Rankin redshirted in 2015 and earned a starting job as a junior in 2016. He had a breakout year in 2017, winning the Kent Hull Trophy and being named to the 2017 All-SEC football team. Professional career NFL Draft Before his senior season, Rankin was projected as a first round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft by several writers. Rankin's draft stock began to slide after he sustained an ankle injury during the season and also had mediocre performances against LSU and Auburn. On November 16, 2017, it was announced that Rankin had accepted his invitation to play in the 2018 Senior Bowl. On January 20, 2018, it was reported that Rankin would be unable to play in the Senior Bowl due to an ankle injury he sustained in the TaxSlayer Bowl. Rankin attended the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, but did not perform any drills due to the foot injury he sustained. On March 28, 2018, he attended Mississippi State's pro day, but chose to only perform the broad jump and vertical jump. Rankin also attended a private meetings with representatives from the Cincinnati Bengals and Denver Broncos. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Rankin was projected to be a second or third round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked as the fourth best offensive tackle by Scouts Inc. and was ranked the seventh best offensive tackle in the draft by DraftScout.com and Sports Illustrated. Houston Texans The Houston Texas selected Rankins in the third round (80th overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft. Rankins was the eighth offensive tackle drafted in 2018. The pick used to draft Rankin was acquired in a trade that sent Duane Brown to the Seattle Seahawks. On May 10, 2018, the Houston Texans signed Rankin to a four-year, $3.54 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $901,268. The Texans stated they drafted Rankin to play offensive tackle although many scouts and draft experts viewed him as an interior offensive lineman in the NFL. During rookie minicamp, Rankin sustained a foot injury which required surgery and was sidelined for the entire training camp. Kansas City Chiefs On August 31, 2019, Rankin was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs in exchange for running back Carlos Hyde. He started five games at left guard before suffering a knee injury in Week 10. He was placed on injured reserve on November 11, 2019. During his absence, the Chiefs went on to win Super Bowl LIV, their first championship in 50 years. He was placed on the active/physically unable to perform list (PUP) at the start of training camp on July 31, 2020. He was moved to the reserve/PUP list at the start of the regular season on September 5, 2020.

The geographic coordinates of what was the main entrance -- roughly the intersection of West 10th Street and North Washington Avenue -- are . Camp Harry J. Jones was an encampment of the United States Army. Located near Douglas, Arizona, it was active during the Pancho Villa Expedition and World War I. History The United States Army established a camp near Douglas, Arizona in 1910, one of a number of camps established along the border with Mexico to provide border security during the conflicts that were part of the Mexican Revolution. The site was renamed Camp Jones in 1916, in honor of a soldier who had been accidentally shot and killed by a stray bullet while on guard duty during the Second Battle of Agua Prieta, which took place between revolutionaries and Mexican government forces across the border from Douglas. Camp Jones was an important facility during the 1916-17 Expedition against Pancho Villa, which was commanded by John J. Pershing, with several cavalry units stationed there to provide security against incursions by Villa's forces. The camp also served as the mobilization site for the Arizona National Guard when it was called up to take part in the Villa Expedition. During the Villa expedition, units based at Camp Jones made extensive use of automobiles and trucks, and also employed aircraft for observation and scouting. This use of motorized vehicles was the Army's first major effort to employ mechanized forces, and foreshadowed its transition away from horses and mules. World War I Camp Jones remained an important location during World War I, and was the headquarters of the Army's Arizona District. Soldiers stationed there continued to patrol the U.S. border with Mexico to deter possible attacks by German soldiers or infiltration by German spies. Closure Camp Jones was closed in January 1933. Several southwestern border posts were proposed for closure as a cost savings measure during the Great Depression. Local leaders in Douglas and state leaders in Arizona attempted to prevent the closure, but were unsuccessful. Many of the troops then stationed at Camp Jones were transferred to nearby Fort Huachuca. Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry Regiment salvaged buildings and other equipment, much of which was sold or moved to Fort Huachuca. There are no existing traces of Camp Jones, and the location of the camp is now a residential area within the Douglas city limits. Location The camp entrance was described in a contemporary account as being at the east end of 10th Street in Douglas. An existing map shows the camp as bounded on the west by North Washington Avenue, on the north by East 13th Street, and on the south by 1st Street. This area corresponds roughly to the area between Calvary Cemetery in Douglas and the Douglas Municipal Airport.

Formed in 1951 as the 16th Radio- Technical Regiment, it was expanded into the 46th Radio-Technical Brigade in 1966. The brigade provided radar capability to the 6th Independent Air Defense Army and then the 54th Air Defense Corps for the air defense of Leningrad, based at Khvoyny. In 2009 it was reorganized as the 333rd Radio-Technical Regiment.  History  The regiment traces its lineage back to the 47th Separate Battalion of the VNOS (Air Observation, Warning, and Communications Service), formed at Stary Petergof as part of the Leningrad air defense system in November and December 1940. The battalion helped defend Leningrad during the siege of the city in World War II, and in the early postwar years became a radio-technical unit. In 1951, the 16th Radio-Technical Regiment was formed from the 32nd, 47th, and 57th Radio-Technical Battalions of the VNOS. In the fall of 1952 the regimental headquarters was moved to Gorelovo. In the fall of 1966, the regiment was expanded into the 46th Radio-Technical Brigade, which included units formerly part of the 2nd Radio-Technical Regiment at Gromovo. In the spring of 1967, the brigade relocated to Khvoyny, providing radar capabilities to the 6th Independent Air Defense Army. In 1986, it became part of the 54th Air Defense Corps. In 2009, the 46th Brigade became the 333rd Radio-Technical Regiment as part of the reform of the Russian Armed Forces. At the same time, the 54th Corps was converted into the 2nd Air Defense Brigade as part of the reform of the Russian Air Forces, and became part of the 1st Air and Air Defense Forces Command. The regiment became part of the 2nd Aerospace Defense Brigade in 2013 and the 2nd Red Banner Air Defense Division in 2014 when the brigade was reorganized. In 2015 the division became part of the 6th Air and Air Defense Forces Army when the latter was reformed.

The car is the third addition in the McLaren Ultimate Series, joining the F1 and the P1; however, it is not a direct successor to either of the cars. The Senna was unveiled online by the company on 10 December 2017, with the official unveiling taking place at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show.  Nomenclature  The car is named after the Brazilian Formula One race driver Ayrton Senna, honouring and giving tribute to his success with the McLaren Formula One Team between and Formula 1 seasons. Senna won three Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles and thirty-five Formula One Grand Prix race wins with the team; McLaren also won four consecutive Formula One World Constructor's Championship titles with Senna as part of their driver line-up. McLaren Automotive holds the rights to the Senna family name along with the Instituto Ayrton Senna. The organisation and McLaren have made the Senna name exclusive to the car, thereby prohibiting any other company from using the name.  Specifications  Rear view Interior McLaren's main focus while designing the Senna was to achieve faster lap times. In order to do so, McLaren developed a lightweight design that incorporated aerodynamic elements. The Senna is largely based on the McLaren 720S, using a modified version of its carbon fibre monocoque and engine. The Senna is powered by a modified version of the McLaren 720S' twin-turbocharged V8 engine codenamed the M840TR. It utilises a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission that delivers all at 7,250 rpm and of torque at 5,500 rpm to the rear wheels. Unlike the previous offering in the Ultimate Series, the McLaren P1, the Senna does not use an electric motor in favour of its low claimed dry weight of , which allows for a maximum power-to-weight ratio of per ton. The car has many aerodynamic elements, there being a large adjustable double-element rear wing (that is operated electronically and has various settings in order to provide optimum performance while also acting as an airbrake), double-element diffuser, Formula One-inspired roof scoop, front and side air intakes, rear air louvres, and large front fenders. Inside the panel beside the intakes is a small set of mini-canards. Areas of low pressure are accompanied using high-performance radiators that ensure improved engine cooling. The car uses dihedral doors, like the previous offerings in the Ultimate Series, and also has optional windows applied on the lower area of its doors. The Senna uses a new generation of Brembo's carbon ceramic brakes, containing a compound that has three and a half times better thermal conductivity than before, making the brakes smaller and lighter. It also features a new set of lightweight center- lock alloy wheels designed for Pirelli P-Zero Trofeo R tyres. Its central design is a new generation of McLaren's carbon fibre monocoque named MonoCage III, which contributes to the car's relatively low dry weight. The car utilises a top mounted (hot-vee) inconel-titanium exhaust system with three outlet pipes in order for a more aggressive exhaust note and engine emissions. The interior consists largely of exposed carbon fibre and Alcantara, with seats that can be upholstered in Alcantara or leather, depending on the customer's preference. Behind the two seats is room large enough for two helmets and race suits, reflecting the car's minimalist and track focused design. The car utilises McLaren's hydraulic RaceActive Chassis Control II (RCC II) suspension along with double-wishbone control arms.

The McLaren Senna is listed at a price of ¬£750,000 with the final car auctioned at a price of ¬£1,916,793. Deliveries began in the third quarter of 2018. McLaren Senna GTR At the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, McLaren unveiled the concept version of the track-only iteration of the Senna dubbed the Senna GTR. The production Senna GTR utilises a dual- clutch race transmission for faster gear shifts, a revised suspension system and Pirelli racing slicks in order to make it the fastest non-Formula One vehicle McLaren has ever created for faster lap times. The Senna GTR is estimated to produce at least from its 4.0 L twin-turbocharged V8 engine and is meant to be faster and more agile than its road-going counterpart. On the exterior, the GTR utilizes wider front and rear fenders, a larger front splitter, new wheels and a bigger rear diffuser in order to make the car generate about of downforce. The Senna GTR will be limited to only 75 examples. In reviewing the future regulations for the World Endurance Championship, the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) identified the Senna GTR as one of several models that fit their vision of a replacement for the Le Mans Prototype class. It was also a competitor at the 2019 Goodwood Festival of Speed.  McLaren Senna LM  The McLaren Senna LM is a track- oriented, street-legal variant of the Senna, made by the McLaren Special Operations department. The bodywork remains the same as the standard Senna, but has components from the Senna GTR. The unique orange livery is a homage to the McLaren F1 LM, which itself is made from inspiration to celebrate the winning F1 GTR that won the 1995 Le Mans. The Senna LM also features polished ports and cylinder heads, OZ center-lock wheels with a retro design, satin- gold-tipped quad exhausts, louvers on the front fenders, the removal of the clear panel in the doors from the standard Senna, titanium panels and LM branding. Power of the 4-liter twin-turbo V8 is now up to 814 hp, which matches the Senna GTR. Only 20 units will be produced, with 5 units to the US market. McLaren Senna GTR LM McLaren, specifically its Special Operations department, officially unveiled the McLaren Senna GTR LM, the road-legal iteration of the trackday-only Senna GTR, online on September 17, 2020. It is not to be confused with the McLaren Senna LM. Only five units have been made, and each has a unique paint scheme reflecting the five McLaren F1 GTRs at the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans. All have been sold: two to customers in the US and three in Europe. The cars were made to celebrate the 25th anniversary of McLaren's win at LeMans. They feature OZ Racing wheels and have the same bodywork as the Senna GTR. Power has been increased to 833 hp, higher than any other Senna variant to date. The redline is also increased from 8250 rpm up to 9000 rpm.  825/1  The first unit of the Senna GTR LM is called the 825/1. This car pays homage to the winning F1 GTR, codenamed the McLaren F1/01R, a.k.a. \\"The Ueno Clinic car\\". The 825/1, like its inspiration, has a one-of-a-kind charcoal-grey paint scheme and even features the various driving lamps from its predecessor.  825/6  The second unit of the Senna GTR LM is called the 825/6. This car reflects the F1 GTR that came in third, codenamed the McLaren F1/06R, a.k.a. \\"The Harrods car\\". The 825/6 has Solar Yellow livery, with the stripe in the middle in Heritage Green.  825/2  The third unit of the Senna GTR LM is the 825/2. This car is based on the F1 GTR that came in fourth, codenamed the McLaren F1/02R, a.k.a. \\"The Gulf car\\". The 825/2's color scheme is an exact replica of the iconic color Gulf Racing Blue and has Ayrton Senna's signature recreated on the rear quarter of the body. This is the only vehicle to have the wheels painted orange.  825/7  The fourth unit of the Senna GTR LM is the 825/7. This car is a tribute to the F1 GTR that finished in fifth place, codenamed the McLaren F1/07R, a.k.a. \\"The Jacadi car\\". The 825/7 has a royal blue livery with the logos of Elf, a French oil company that sponsored the Giroix Racing Team that ran the car.  825/5  The fifth and last unit of the Senna GTR LM is the 825/5. This example pays homage to the F1 GTR that came in thirteenth, codenamed the McLaren F1/05R. The 825/5 took the longest time out of all the vehicles to paint as it uses extensive airbrushing to include lap times and Le Mans branding cues. In media * The McLaren Senna is featured both on the cover and as a drivable vehicle in the racing videogame Forza Horizon 4 and was added in the April 2019 \\"Easter Update\\" for Forza Motorsport 7. A Lego Speed Champions version of the car exists and in featured in Forza Horizon 4s Lego Speed Champions expansion where it is slightly faster than the base version. It is also available to drive in the racing videogame Real Racing 3, added in March 2020's \\"McLaren Senna Update\\". * Additionally, the Senna was featured in a segment of The Grand Tour. It was reviewed by Jeremy Clarkson who described it as having \\"rewritten the supercar rule book\\". The car also posted a 1:12.9 second lap time around the Grand Tour test track, the Eboladrome, the fastest time to date. However, the vehicle does not appear in The Grand Tour Game due to licensing issues. * Additionally, the car was also added to GTA Vs multiplayer online crime game Grand Theft Auto Online as the \\"Progen Emerus\\"; Progen is the in-game parody of McLaren. The GTA V Progen Emerus features a different design, including headlights from the Ferrari FXX-K, a spoiler from the McLaren P1 GTR, and the McLaren Speedtail's body. * The Senna also appears in Asphalt 9: Legends, added in July 2019's \\"Tune It Up Update\\" as a blueprint-buildable car requiring 45 blueprints to unlock. It also appears as a high-end class S car. * The car also appears in Asphalt 8: Airborne, added in January 2020's \\"2020 Lunar New Year Update\\", along with three other cars: the Infiniti Project Black S Special Edition, the Lotus Evija, and the Drako GTE.

Owned by the privately held Daylight Donut Flour Company, LLC, the chain has approximately 1,000 locations in 13 countries. Each Daylight Donuts store is independently owned and operated. History Founding and Expansion The origins of Daylight Donuts can be traced back to Tommy and Lucille Day in 1954. The couple opened a small business in Tulsa, Oklahoma and began producing doughnut mix in the mornings and selling them to shops in the afternoon, mostly out of the trunk of their car. The couple created a new doughnut mixture that they believed was more flavorful and had a lighter consistency than many other doughnuts on the market. The couple decided to call this business, \\"Daylight Donuts Flour Co.\\" Mr. Day, having previously worked in the baking industry, helped a friend, Mr. Durard Pendergraft open a small doughnut shop in Joplin, Missouri on September 22, 1954. The store initially sold doughnuts for 37 cents per dozen. By 1960, the company had grown enough that the Days were able to hire two new employees and also built a 20,000 square foot facility for additional space. In 1977, the Days retired and sold the company to Jerry and Linda Hull. By this time, there were more than 200 Daylight Donuts stores in operation. Also during this time, the company began using its own fleet of trucks. In 2002, John and Sheila Bond purchased the company. The new owners expanded the production facility into a 65,000 square foot state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. They also increased the products that were offered by the company. In 2003, the company started its own private label coffee and began selling it to shop owners. Recent History The original Daylight Donuts location (2124 S. Main Street) was destroyed in the 2011 Joplin tornado and has since relocated to 2316 S. Main Street. In 2014 the company celebrated its 60th anniversary with a renewed commitment to ingredients, products and business practices. As of 2016, Daylight Donuts operates 430 licensed locations where Daylight Donuts are made and over 1,000 locations worldwide where they are sold. Additionally, Daylight Donut Flour Company, LLC produces 230,000 pounds of doughnut mix per week, enough mix for 2.5 million doughnuts weekly.

Its first public performance was in 1925. The song was strongly associated with him, and his imitators use it as \\"an instant identification symbol\\". Chevalier performed the song, in French, in two American movies, Innocents of Paris (1928) and Folies Berg√®re de Paris (1935), but to not offend American sensibilities the word t√©tons (breasts) was replaced with a mysterious piton, which translates as peg or protuberance. \\"Piton\\" was needed for the rhyme scheme, but Chevalier always pointed to his nose at that moment in the song, to indicate what part of his lover's anatomy he was supposedly fondling.  History  In 1924, Maurice Chevalier was no longer a stranger to the public eye. His passionate love affair with the French songstress Mistinguett and \\"Dans la vie faut pas s'en faire\\" (\\"You don't have to make much of your life\\"), a song that became his first hit the following year, had brought him a certain notoriety. He felt he was at the dawn of a great career. Shortly after meeting his future wife Yvonne Vall√©e, he signed a three-year contract with to take part in three revues at the Casino de Paris.Kirgener, pp. 80, 84 et 90. On November 28, 1925, Chevalier premiered a new revue titled Paris en fleurs, in which he co-starred with Yvonne Vall√©e. The public hurried en masse to witness their love. Chevalier sang \\"Valentine\\", a song with somewhat risque lyrics ‚Äì \\"imbued with caf√©-concert spirit\\" ‚Äì for the first time in this revue.Kirgener, p. 90. Many artists and observers consider that only Chevalier could sing this song while maintaining a certain properness of manner. For example, Yves Montand has noted: [...] and the charm of Maurice Chevalier arriving on stage [...] he had extraordinary looks and class [...] \\"Maurice often took songs that were trendy and that he imposed with his authentic geniality: one had to be a genius to impose \\"Valentine\\"!\\"Kirgener, p. 91. The public went to the Casino de Paris regularly just to hear this song.Kirgener, pages 90 and 91. According to Dave DiMartino in his book Music in the 20th Century, Chevalier's \\"rendition of lighthearted songs such as 'Valentine' [...] seemed to conjure up the romantic feel of Paris\\".  Composition  Albert Willemetz and Henri Christin√© wrote \\"Valentine\\" for Chevalier. The song starts off saying that you always remember your first lover. In the singer's case, her name was Valentine. In the chorus the singer describes her as having small feet, little breasts (\\"Elle avait des tout petits t√©tons\\") and a little chin. She also was \\"curly like a sheep\\". The song goes on to add (in translation) \\"She wasn‚Äôt the brightest/But in bed, that‚Äôs not important.\\" The singer runs into her in the street many years later. He sees a women who is as fat as a hippopotamus, has a double chin and \\"triple breasts\\". She runs up to him with an affectionate shout and throws her arms around his neck. He does not recognize her at all and asks \\"Excuse me, but who are you?\\" And she replies that she is Valentine. The last lines, sung ruefully, translate as \\"Oh poor little Valentine, that should not be allowed...not be allowed, no.\\" Later versions and performances Chevalier performed the song in his first American movie, Innocents of Paris (1928), a musical comedy directed by Richard Wallace and starring Sylvia Beecher. He sang it again in the 1935 movie Folies Berg√®re de Paris (both in the American version directed by Roy Del Ruth and the French version directed by Marcel Achard).Vidal and Champion, pages 311 and 312.Vals, pages 208 and 209. In order not to shock the American public, the original lyrics: were modified as When Chevalier sang the word \\"piton\\", he pointed his finger at his nose to indicate what the piton was.

Campbell was the widow of South Carolina Governor Carroll A. Campbell Jr., and became an activist on behalf of Alzheimer's disease patients following his 2005 death from the illness. She remained a highly influential figure in South Carolinian political and state Republican Party circles long after leaving her position in the Governor‚Äôs Mansion. Her endorsements were sought after by major Republican U.S. presidential and state gubernatorial candidates. Biography Campbell was born Iris Rhodes on February 12, 1940, in Greenville, South Carolina, to Archelious Talmadge Rhodes and Sue Nell Cox Rhodes. She met her future husband, Carroll Campbell, while working at a drug store lunch counter in Greenville. They married in 1959 while both were still teenagers. The couple had two sons, Michael Campbell and Carroll A. Campbell III. Campbell served as First Lady of South Carolina for two terms from 1987 to 1995 during the tenure of Governor Campbell. She focused on programs and initiatives to benefit women and children, especially those with special needs. Campbell promoted a horsebacking riding program for kids with disabilities and hosted an annual Easter egg hunt at Palmetto Health Children's Hospital. She also championed the American Cancer Society and sought to increase public awareness on the need for smoke detectors. In a 2001 interview with The State, Campbell stated that she hoped her legacy as first lady would be her work with children, telling the newspaper, \\"When you're the first lady, everybody wants you to chair something or be involved in different things. I felt if I kept my concern to one thing ‚Äì children and families ‚Äì I could be the most effective.\\" Former Governor Carroll A. Campbell Jr. died from complications of Alzheimer's disease in 2005. Iris Campbell became an advocate for Alzeheimer's treatment and research following her husband's death. She appeared at events and created a golf tournament to raise funds to seek a cure for the disease. Iris Campbell also became a political figure following Governor Campbell's death. During the 2000s and 2010s, she became a prominent Republican figure during South Carolina's elections. Her endorsement was pursued by Republican U.S. presidential candidates during the important South Carolina presidential primaries, which take place early in the election year. Campbell endorsed former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee during the 2008 presidential primary and then gave her endorsement to former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman during the 2012 primaries. Most recently, Campbell publicly supported former Florida Governor Jeb Bush during the heated 2016 South Carolina Republican primary. In 2010, Campbell endorsed then-State Representative Nikki Haley in that year's gubernatorial election. Haley won both the Republican primary and the general election. In addition to her endorsements, the former first lady remained engaged in day-to-day state politics. During the 2010s, Iris Campbell spearheaded an effort to restructure South Carolina's state government. Campbell's efforts to pass the proposed legislation proved successful and resulted in the creation of the new Department of Administration. In 2014 bill signing ceremony, Governor Nikki Haley specifically honored Campbell for her contributions to the new law and the creation of the department. Haley gifted the first pen used in the bill signing ceremony to Campbell. Iris Campbell died in her sleep, following a short illness, at her home in DeBordieu, South Carolina, on November 20, 2017, at the age of 77. She was survived by her two sons, Michael Campbell and Carroll A. Campbell III, and four grandchildren.

Zhang () is a professor at Thayer School of Engineering of Dartmouth College, and an investigator in the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. Before joining Dartmouth, he was an associate professor with tenure in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Texas of Austin (UT Austin). He received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford University, California in 2004, and was a research scientist in systems biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) before joining the faculty at UT Austin in 2005. Zhang is a Fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE), and a recipient of the 2016 NIH Director's Transformative Research Award.  Career  Zhang's research focuses on exploring bio-inspired nanomaterials, scale-dependent biophysics, and nanofabrication technology. The objectives are to: (1) develop new diagnostic devices and methods to screen rare biomarkers for a range of human disorders; (2) probe complex cellular processes and biological networks critical to whole-body functions in health and disease; and (3) to advance fundamental micro and nanotechnologies. Both multi-scale experimental and theoretical approaches are combined within the lab to investigate fundamental force, flow, and energy processes that lie at the interface of engineering and biomedicine. By favoring this innovative, combinatorial approach, the Zhang research group has become a leader in the development of integrated microfluidic and photonic microsystems (MEMS, micro-electro-mechanical systems), semiconductor chips, and other nanotechnologies to facilitate precision medicine and point-of-care (POC) diagnostics for global health initiatives, as evidenced by the development and validation of: * Liquid biopsy microchips for the capture and analysis of rare, circulating tumor cells (NIH R01); * Flexible nano-confined, thin films for biosensing and implantable energy generation (NIH R01, Facebook, NSF grants); * Quantum dots- based near-field imaging: NSOM and cellular microarrays (NSF EPDT & IMR grants); * Patterned plasmonic surfaces on MEMS for biosensors (DARPA Young Faculty Award, NASA); * Microphotonic imaging scanners and microsystems for early cancer detection (Wallace H. Coulter Early Career Award in Biomedical Engineering, Tate Foundation, NSF SBIR, and National Instruments Medical Device Grant Program); and * Plasmonic scanning probes for controlled genetic perturbation and imaging (NSF CAREER, NER and CMMI grants). Zhang has a track record for developing well-funded research programs with significant societal impact, and his research has been sponsored by the NIH, NSF, DARPA, the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation, British Council, and several other agencies and industrial partners. His group has published over 160 peer-reviewed publications, presented over 70 invited seminars worldwide, and filed more than 50 patents (8 US patents and 30+ international patents issued). Several patents were licensed to CardioSepctra, Inc., which was later acquired by Volcano Corporation (NASDAQ:VOLC) for $25 million, and NanoLite Systems, Inc., which he co-founded in 2010 (with $3.3 million seed investment) for developing products designed to diagnose cancer through blood screening, tissue imaging and cell transformations at the point-of-care. In 2013, LifeM Inc. was spanned out of his laboratory to develop flexible pressure sensors (the ‚ÄúX2 sensor‚Äù) for catheter applications. These innovative sensors allow for multiple points of blood pressure measurement, leading to reduced surgery risk and operating time. His translational effort won the Medical Device Grant from National Instruments in 2011. In 2012, Dr. Zhang has been recognized as one of the MD+DI's (Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry) ‚Äú40 Medtech Innovators Under 40‚Äù.

The Code was originally enacted in 1856 and underwent substantial revision in 1973, with the passage of the Revised Penal Code, in large part based on the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code., p. 66 Alt URL  History  The first codification of Texas criminal law was the Texas Penal Code of 1856. Prior to 1856, criminal law in Texas was governed by the common law, with the exception of a few penal statutes. In 1854, the fifth Legislature passed an act requiring the Governor to appoint a commission to codify the civil and criminal laws of Texas. Only the Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure, both authored by James Willie, were passed by the sixth Legislature and were effective as of February 1, 1857. These came to be referred to as the \\"Old Codes.\\" The code underwent a major reorganization and reconciliation of existing criminal laws with the adoption of the Texas Penal Code of 1974. According to the Texas Legislative Counsel, the main objectives of the Revised Penal Code were to (1) consolidate, simplify, and clarify the substantive law of crimes; (2) modernize a Penal Code designed for the preindustrialized, rural, and underpopulated Texas society of a century ago; (3) identify and proscribe, with as much precision as possible, all significantly harmful criminal conduct; (4) rationally grade offenses, according to the harm they cause or threaten, and sensibly apportion the sentencing authority between the judiciary and correctional system; (5) codify the general principles of the penal law; and (6) collect in a single code all significant penal law, transferring to more appropriate locations in the statutes regulatory and similar laws that merely employed a penal sanction. Dean W. Page Keeton of the University of Texas played a key role in drafting, revising, and promoting the Revised Penal Code.  Organization  The Texas Penal Code is organized into titles and chapters. As of 2017, the basic structure is as follows: #Title 1: Introductory Provisions - Declares that all persons are presumed innocent unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. ##Chapter 1. General Provisions ##*Sec. 1.02 states the objectives of the penal code: \\"to establish a system of prohibitions, penalties, and correctional measures to deal with conduct that unjustifiably and inexcusably causes or threatens harm to those individual or public interests for which state protection is appropriate\\" through deterrence, rehabilitation, and punishment of convicted persons; by giving fair warning of prohibited conduct and consequences of violation; to prescribe penalties proportionate with the seriousness of offenses and take rehabilitation potential into consideration; \\"to safeguard conduct that is without guilt from condemnation as criminal\\"; to guide and limit law enforcement; and \\"to define the scope of state interest in law enforcement against specific offenses and to systematize the exercise of state criminal jurisdiction.\\" ##*Sec. 1.03 provides that conduct not prohibited by law is not a criminal offense. ##*Sec. 1.04 through Sec. 1.09 cover: construction of the code (according to fair import of terms), computation of age, definitions, preemption (prohibiting political subdivisions from enacting or enforcing laws criminalizing same conduct as criminalized in Penal Code), and concurrent jurisdiction for offenses involving state property (granting Attorney General concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute if local prosecutor consents). ##Chapter 2. Burden of Proof ###Sec. 2.01 provides that all persons are presumed innocent unless each element of the offense alleged is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. ###Sec. 2.02 provides that the prosecutor must negate the existence of an exception where an exception is specifically stated in the statute. ###Sec. 2.03 provides that it is not the prosecutor's duty to disprove a defense and that the jury will not be instructed regarding any defense unless evidence is admitted to support the defense, and that if the defense is submitted to a jury, then the jury will be instructed \\"that a reasonable doubt on the issue requires that the defendant be acquitted.\\" ###Sec. 2.04 provides the standard for affirmative defenses, which is essentially the same as for non-affirmative defenses except that the jury is instructed \\"that the defendant must prove the affirmative defense by a preponderance of evidence.\\" ###Sec. 2.05 covers presumptions and requires that \\"if there is sufficient evidence of facts that give rise to the presumption, the issue of the existence of the presumed fact must be submitted to the jury, unless the court is satisfied that the evidence as a whole clearly precludes a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of the presumed fact.\\" ##Chapter 3. Multiple Prosecutions ##There is no Chapter 4 or Chapter #Title 2. General Principles of Criminal Responsibility ##Chapter 6. Culpability Generally ##*Covers concepts such as mens rea and actus reus. ##Chapter 7. Criminal Responsibility for Conduct of Another ##*Covers complicity and corporate liability. ##Chapter 8.
