Cam., (born at Venice in 1444; died 16 January 1525) was an Italian Camaldolese monk, patristic scholar, theologian, abbot, and Superior General of his religious Order. Life Pietro Delfin was a patrician of Venice, member of the famous Delfin family, one of the oldest noble families in Venice. Pietro entered the Camaldolese Monastery of St. Michael, which was located on the island of Murano in the Venetian Lagoon. In 1479, he was elected abbot of the same community. The following year he was made prior general of the Order, based at Camaldoli in the region of Arezzo. He held that office until the year 1513 when he resigned in favour of Paul Giustiniani, whom he had invested with the Camaldolese habit in 1510. Delfin was the forty-sixth prior general from St. Romuald, the founder of the Camaldolese, and he was the last elected for life --the office after him being held for three years only. From 1481 to 1508, Delfin was proposed to serve as bishop of Venice on five occasions, but refused them all. On four occasions he was also proposed to serve as Patriarch of Aquilea, but refused again. He was also presented with the cardinalate in two occasions, but respectfully declined to the Pope to continue serving the camaldolese order. Delfin was one of the main opposers to Savonarola, but still promoted the reform inside the Catholic Church which would lead to the Council of Trento. Works The letters of Delfin, which number more than 4,000, are addressed to other religions and other orders and to various secular dignitaries, contain accounts of contemporary events in his own Order and the Church in general. A collection of his Latin letters was published at Venice in 1524. Several others that had been omitted in the Venetian editions were included later in Mart√®ne's \\"Veterum Scriptorum amplissima collectio\\". The \\"Apothegmata Patrum\\" and the \\"Dialogues\\" on Savonarola are still unedited.

The excess semiconductor from under the beams was removed, thereby separating the individual devices and leaving them with self- supporting beam leads or internal chiplets cantilevered beyond the semiconductor. The contacts served as electrical leads in addition to also serving the purpose of structural support for the devices.

It was used in the 20th century as a prisoner of war camp, a home for handicapped children and later as a military and civilian hospital. History The estate was originally known as \\"Hill\\". In St Mary's Church, Bishops Lydeard, is a monument inscribed as follows: :\\"In a vault near this place lyeth the body of Elizabeth Periam, relict of John Periam of Hill, Esq, and dau(ghter) of John Southey of Fitzhead, Esq. ...she ....died lamented May 14, 1767, aged 68 ...

John, History and Antiquities of the County of Somerset, Vol.3, Bath, 1791, p.17 The mansion was built in 1720 by John II Periam, the Member of Parliament for Minehead, and named \\"Hill House\\". It was afterwards lived in by the Lethbridge family from 1767 to 1913. During World War I it was used as a prisoner of war camp for German and Austrian Officers. In 1919 it was converted by Somerset County Council into a home for handicapped children. It was requisitioned by the military in August 1940 and became the 41st General Military Hospital, providing accommodation in tents and huts. From 1941 the hospital was leased to the Americans as a neurological hospital for over 1,000 patients in 32 new wards which were completed in 1943. In 1943, the US Army 127th General Hospital moved in caring for patients and preparing to follow the invasion forces. In May 1944, the 127th was replaced by the 185th General Hospital that continued to staff the hospital until July 1945. See 185th General Hospital. The hospital remained in military use until 1945. The psychiatric hospital reopened under the National Health Service in 1948 and further buildings were constructed. The hospital was sold in 1991 and housing built on part of the area. It is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage. The derelict building was badly damaged by fire on November 22, 2011, which was caused by arson. The east wing gutted along with more modern additions to the rear. The main house suffered extensive damage, the roof and top floor being lost and significant secondary damage caused by fire water. The west wing and orangery appear to have been untouched by the fire. In 2013 Sandhill Park was purchased by local developer Strongvox Homes. After years of decay and the serious fire in 2011 the only viable way to save the mansion house was for a sympathetic development of new houses in the grounds. Strongvox Homes worked closely with the planning department and English Heritage and in 2012 planning permission was approved for 28 detached houses and the conversion of the mansion house into 26 apartments.

Biography From 1844 to 1849 Peter Fuchs was an apprentice mason in the Cologne Dombauh√ºtte and for the next two years he worked as a mason for St. Nicolai in Hamburg and in the studio of Vincenz Statz in Cologne. From 1851 to 1854 he worked in Speyer with the sculptor Gottfried Renn (1818‚Äì1880) and in Frankfurt am Main with Eduard Schmidt von der Launitz (1797‚Äì1869) and Eduard Jakob von Steinle. In 1855 Peter Fuchs returned to Cologne, where he created such large sandstone reliefs and statue groups as the Four Prophets (1858) for the Mariens√§ule in the Gereonsdriesch and the life-size figures of SS Dionysius and Reinold (1866‚Äì1871) for the west front of St. Mauritius. thumb From 1865 to 1881 he produced some 700 life-size and slightly over-life-size sculptures for Cologne Cathedral, mostly reliefs and seated and standing figures depicting scenes from the Bible and lives of the saints. Many of these are to be found on the columns and walls of the south transept (1866‚Äì1872), the west towers (1871), the west front and the north front (1879‚Äì1881) and the Petersportal (1881). Several preliminary drawings (1879‚Äì1880) for uncompleted sculptures are located in the Dombauarchiv. Influenced by the Nazarenes, after 1870 Peter Fuchs lengthened his figures and encased them in garments with sharp-edged, graphic folds. He was also influenced by the work of contemporary German sculptors working in the monumental style, as can be seen in the rendering of naturalistic heads and pathetic expression and in the isolation of the figures from each other. The reliefs and statues of Old and New Testament prophets (1895‚Äì1898) from the tympanum and the bronze doors of the west front of Bremen Cathedral, with their attenuated stances and pronounced folds of drapery, show his debt to the figures in Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise (Florence, Mus. Opera Duomo) and to the sculptures of the Beuron Art School of the last third of the 19th century. References *Peter Fuchs.\\" The Concise Grove Dictionary of Art.

After the United States established the Guantanamo Bay detention camp at its naval base in Cuba, officials occasionally allowed Guantanamo captives' phone calls to their family. In 2008 the Joint Task Force Guantanamo that manages the camps developed rules regarding phone calls: all detainees who met certain conditions were allowed to make one call home per year. On September 29, 2009, the International Committee of the Red Cross announced that Guantanamo captives and their families would be allowed to communicate through a two-way video link. Since May 2008, a similar facility has been available to captives held in extrajudicial detention in Bagram Theater Internment Facility. This facility has been available to American GIs for many years. The first video call was made between a Pakistani captive and his family. His family traveled to the ICRC's Peshawar office, where one end of the video link had been set up. Phone calls for detainees While some phone calls to families had been allowed at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, in 2008 the Joint Military Task Force developed policy and procedures to allow all detainees who satisfied certain conditions to make one phone call annually. Facilities were upgraded and in 2009, the Red Cross assisted with setting up video calls to its centers overseas. *When Salim Ahmed Hamdan was allowed a call home, on August 6, 2008, after his Guantanamo Military Commission acquitted him of conspiracy and convicted him of material support for terrorism, his was the 107th call. *Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi, a Yemeni who faced charges before a Guantanamo military commission, told his Presiding Officer he had not been able to acquire a Yemeni lawyer because he had not been able to contact his family during his six years of detention. On May 22, 2008 his Presiding Officer ordered that arrangements should be made for him to have a one-hour phone call home, by July 1, 2008. Pauline Storum, deputy commander for Public Affairs for Joint Task Force Guantanamo, told reporters later that same day that arrangements for the call had already been put in place, and that the call had taken place. Suzanne Lachelier, the officer who had been authorized to coordinate the call, said she was surprised to read newspaper reports that the call had taken place. She said she had not begun to make the arrangements. Storun later sent a retraction to reporters, without explanation of the error. *Muhammad Hamid Al Qarani, one of the younger captives, was allowed his first phone call in 2009. Rather than calling his family, he called Sami Al Hajj, a recently released detainee who is an Al Jazeera journalist. As reported by Al- Jazeera, he told Al Hajj that abuse had continued at the camp despite the election of United States President Barack Obama. Al Qarani was transferred to Saudi Arabia on June 13, 2009, to undergo a rehabilitation programme, less than two months after the call. *Abdul Al Salam Al Hilal was allowed his first call home in April 2009. His two sons died two days later, in an apparent accident with a hand grenade. In a second phone call in August 2009, he told his family that he feared he would be assassinated in Guantanamo.

Early life John Cooper Jr. was born in Jacksonville, Florida, to John Cobb and Mary Coldwell Cooper. After graduating from Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, he was educated at Princeton University and received an AB degree in 1909. Career In 1911 was admitted to the Florida Bar. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1916 and 1924. In 1917 he joined the U.S. Navy, and would reach the rank of lieutenant by the end of World War I. He was married to Martha Helen Marvel in 1918 and the couple had three children: two girls and a boy. A year later he was relieved from active service and became a member of the Naval Reserve. In 1921 his rank became Lieutenant-Commander. From 1927 to 1934 he was Editor-in-Chief of the Florida State Bar Association Law Journal. He was appointed to the International Technical Committee of Legal Aerial Experts, 1932‚Äì1934. He became Vice President of Pan American Airways 1934‚Äì1945, serving on the board of directors 1944‚Äì1946. In such capacity, he was elected as a member of the first executive committee of the International Air Transport Association in 1945. In 1947 he served as a consultant to the U.S. President's Air Policy Commission. He was a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, 1945‚Äì1950. In 1951, Cooper founded the Institute of Air & Space Law at McGill University in Montreal, which had become the home of the International Civil Aviation Organization, the U.N. body charged with safety in air navigation. In 1952 he was awarded his LLD from McGill University. From 1951‚Äì57 he was professor of International Air Law at McGill University, becoming the first director of the Institute of International Air Law, after which he was named Professor Emeritus. He was the author of the book The Right to Fly and pioneered legal thought on air/space rights of man- made satellites in orbit, commencing with the launch of Sputnik in October 1957 when asked by President Eisenhower to render a legal opinion on \\"flyover rights\\" when Sputnik was orbiting over the United States. His honorary doctorate from his alma mater, Princeton University, declared him the \\"Father of Air Space Law\\". He was the legal counsel to the International Air Transport Association (IATA) from the early 1950s through to the end of his life. He was a pioneer in the field of international law as it applied to air and space. He wrote the first article on the topic of space ownership, \\"High Altitude Flight and National Sovereignty\\", in 1951. His younger brother was movie producer Merian C. Cooper, perhaps most famous for the creation of the movie King Kong in 1933, and whose position as a Director of Pan Am was responsible for recommending his older brother for the position of Pan Am's legal counsel and Vice President. He flew with Charles Lindbergh, a consultant for PanAm, in small aircraft on site surveys to select sites in Ireland (Shannon) and France (Orly) for airports as Pan Am's services overseas increased.

He was the son of Lt-Col. the Hon. Harold Henderson and grew up in Shellingford. Henderson was sent to Eton College, then attended McGill University in Montreal, before graduating from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1924. At Oxford he was part of the Hypocrites' Club. Described by David Cargill as a \\"roaring pansy\\", Henderson was known for his effeminate demeanour, once opening a speech in the House of Lords with the words \\"My dears\\" instead of \\"My Lords\\". His marriage, to the Hon. Honor Chedworth Philipps (the daughter of Owen Philipps, 1st Baron Kylsant), lasted only four years (consecrated in 1927; annulled in 1931). He succeeded to the title of 2nd Baron Faringdon, and inherited the estate of Buscot Park from his grandfather Alexander Henderson, 1st Baron Faringdon in 1934. In early life he had been prominent among the bright young things, but by the late 1930s had joined the Labour Party, and was a keen supporter of the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, after serving in a field hospital in Aragon in 1936. In 1938 he gave a home to 40 child evacuees from Spain, as well as to several other notable exiles, at his Oxfordshire estate. A noted pacifist, Faringdon served in the London Fire Brigade during World War II. Post-war he was a prominent member of the Fabian Society, and also served on the London County Council. He was elected as a councillor on 16 April 1958 for the Woolwich West division but was defeated by a Conservative at the 1961 election. Following his defeat, he was appointed an alderman, a post he held until 1965. He then served on the Greater London Council's Historic Buildings Committee. Gavin Henderson died in 1977 without issue, and was succeeded by his nephew Charles Michael Henderson as 3rd Baron Faringdon.

Governmental In its 2008 annual report, Microsoft stated: Antitrust In the 1990s, Microsoft adopted exclusionary licensing under which PC manufacturers were required to pay for an MS-DOS license even when the system shipped with an alternative operating system. Critics attest that it also used predatory tactics to price its competitors out of the market and that Microsoft erected technical barriers to make it appear that competing products did not work on its operating system. In a consent decree filed on July 15, 1994, Microsoft agreed to a deal under which, among other things, the company would not make the sale of its operating systems conditional on the purchase of any other Microsoft product. On February 14, 1995 Judge Stanley Sporkin issued a 45-page opinion that the consent decree was not in the public interest. Later that spring, a three-judge federal appeals panel removed Sporkin and reassigned the consent decree. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson entered the decree on August 21, 1995, three days before the launch of Windows 95.Wallace, James (1997), Overdrive, John Wiley & Sons. . A Microsoft purchase of Intuit was scuttled in 1994 due to antitrust concerns that Microsoft would be purchasing a major competitor. After bundling the Internet Explorer web browser into its Windows operating system in the late 1990s (without requiring a separate purchase) and acquiring a dominant share in the web browser market, the antitrust case United States v. Microsoft was brought against the company. In a series of rulings by judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, the company was found to have violated its earlier consent decree and abused its monopoly in the desktop operating systems market. The \\"findings of fact\\" during the antitrust case established that Microsoft has a monopoly in the PC desktop operating systems market: > Viewed together, three main facts indicate that Microsoft enjoys monopoly > power. First, Microsoft's share of the market for Intel-compatible PC > operating systems is extremely large and stable. Second, Microsoft's > dominant market share is protected by a high barrier to entry. Third, and > largely as a result of that barrier, Microsoft's customers lack a > commercially viable alternative to Windows. (III.34) The findings of fact go on to explain the nature of the \\"barrier to entry\\": > The fact that there is a multitude of people using Windows makes the product > more attractive to consumers. The large installed base ... impels ISVs > (independent software vendors) to write applications first and foremost to > Windows, thereby ensuring a large body of applications from which consumers > can choose. The large body of applications thus reinforces demand for > Windows, augmenting Microsoft's dominant position and thereby perpetuating > ISV incentives to write applications principally for Windows ... The small > or non-existent market share of an aspiring competitor makes it > prohibitively expensive for the aspirant to develop its PC operating system > into an acceptable substitute for Windows. (III.39‚Äì40) The proposed remedy (dividing Microsoft into two companies) was never applied. The judge who decided the original case was removed from the decision concerning the penalty due to public statements, and replaced by a judge more sympathetic to Microsoft. While new penalties were under consideration, the Clinton administration ended and the Bush administration took office. The new administration announced that in the interest of ending the case as quickly as possible, it would no longer seek to break the company up, and that it would stop investigating claims of illegal tying of products. Eighteen days later, Judge Kollar-Kotelly ordered the justice department and Microsoft to \\"engage in discussions seven days a week, 24 hours a day.\\" The judge cited the events of September 11, 2001, in her direction to begin settlement talks but did not explain the linkage between the two. Attorney General Ashcroft, however, denied that the events of September 11 had any effect on the outcome. Microsoft subsequently reached a settlement with the Department of Justice and some of the states which brought suit against it. Several class-action lawsuits filed after the conviction are still pending. In early 2002, Microsoft proposed to settle the private lawsuits by donating $1 billion USD in money, software, services, and training, including Windows licenses and refurbished PCs, to about 12,500 underprivileged public schools. This was seen by the judge as a potential windfall for Microsoft, not only in educating schoolchildren on Microsoft solutions but also in flooding the market with Microsoft products. Among the protesters were Apple Inc. which feared further loss of its educational market share. The federal judge rejected the proposed settlement. Headquarters of the European Commission, which has imposed several fines on Microsoft In 2003 to 2004, the European Commission investigated the bundling of Windows Media Player into Windows, a practice which rivals complained was destroying the market for their own products. Negotiations between Microsoft and the Commission broke down in March 2004, and the company was subsequently handed down a record fine of ‚Ç¨497 million ($666 million) for its breaches of EU competition law. Separate investigations into alleged abuses of the server market were also ongoing at the same time. On December 22, 2004, the European Court decided that the measures imposed on Microsoft by the European Commission would not be delayed, as was requested by Microsoft while waiting for the appeal. Microsoft has since paid a ‚Ç¨497 million fine, shipped versions of Windows without Windows Media Player, and licensed many of the protocols used in its products to developers in countries within the European Economic Area. However, the European Commission has charactized the much delayed protocol licensing as unreasonable, called Microsoft \\"non- compliant\\" and still violating antitrust law in 2007, and said that its RAND terms were above market prices; in addition, they said software patents covering the code \\"lack significant innovation\\", which Microsoft and the EC had agreed would determine licensing fees. Microsoft responded by saying, that other government agencies had found \\"considerable innovation\\". Microsoft appealed the facts and ruling to the European Court of First Instance with hearings in September 2006. In 2000, a group of customers and business filed a class action suit in Comes v. Microsoft Corp., alleging that Microsoft violated Iowa's antitrust laws by engaging in monopolistic practices.Comes v. Microsoft Corp., 646 N.W.2d 440 (2002); see also $180 Million Microsoft Iowa Antitrust Settlement Results in Cash Benefits to Consumers, (2007-08-14). In 2002, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that indirect purchasers (consumers who purchased computers from a third-party, with Microsoft's software pre- installed in the computer) could be included as members of the class in the class action suit.Comes v. Microsoft Corp., 646 N.W.2d 440 (2002) On remand, the trial court certified two classes of plaintiffs, and the Iowa Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the class certification.Comes v. Microsoft Corp., 696 N.W.2d 318 (Iowa 2005); standard of review on remand later determined in Comes v. Microsoft Corp., 709 N.W.2d 114 (Iowa 2006). In August 2007, the parties ultimately reached a settlement valued at $179.95 million.$180 Million Microsoft Iowa Antitrust Settlement Results in Cash Benefits to Consumers, (August 14, 2007). On September 17, 2007, the EU Court of First Instance rejected Microsoft's appeal. The court affirmed the original contested finding:Commission Decision 2007/53/EC of 24 March 2004 relating to a proceeding pursuant to Article 82 EC and Article 54 of the EEA Agreement against Microsoft Corp. (Case COMP/C-3/37.792 ‚Äì Microsoft) All elements of Microsoft's appeal were dismissed. Microsoft accepted the judgment of the Court of First Instance and proceeded to make available interoperability information as originally required by the European Commission. Microsoft also faced competition law in South Korea and was fined $32 million in December 2005 and ordered to unbundle instant messaging, Windows Media Player and Windows Media Service, or let competitors' products take their place. Microsoft noted in their October 2005 SEC filing that they may have to pull out of South Korea, although they later denied fulfilling such a plan. Microsoft's 2006 appeal was struck down; they have another appeal pending. Microsoft also faced sanctions from Japan Fair Trade Commission twice in 1998 when Japanese manufacturers were forced to include Microsoft Word on new systems instead of homegrown word processor software Ichitaro, and again in 2004 for clauses detrimental to ability of Japanese computer manufacturers to obtain a Windows OEM license. European antitrust regulators on February 27, 2008 fined Microsoft $1.3 billion for failing to comply with a 2004 judgment, that the company had abused its market dominance. The new fine by the European Commission was the largest it has ever imposed on an individual company, and brings the total in fines imposed on Microsoft to about $US 2.5 billion, at current exchange rates. Microsoft had previously been fined after the commission determined in 2004 that the company had abused the dominance of its Windows operating system to gain unfair market advantage. The commission imposing the new fine said, that it was because the company had not met the prescribed remedies after the earlier judgment. =European Union= The European Union Microsoft competition case is a case brought by the European Commission of the European Union (EU) against Microsoft for abuse of its dominant position in the market (according to competition law). It started as a complaint from Novell over Microsoft's licensing practices in 1993, and eventually resulted in the EU ordering Microsoft to divulge certain information about its server products and release a version of Microsoft Windows without Windows Media Player. February 2008 fine On February 27, 2008 the European Union (EU) competitions commission announced its decision to fine the Microsoft Corporation ‚Ç¨899 million (US$1.35 billion), approximately 1/10 of the company's net yearly earnings, for failing to comply with the 2004 antitrust order. The first decision in this antitrust case was given in 2004 citing that Microsoft withheld needed interoperability information from rival software companies which prevented them from making software compatible with Windows. The commission ordered Microsoft to provide this information. Microsoft agreed to this, providing the information for royalty fees of 6.85% of the licensee's revenues for the product on grounds of innovation (specifically, 3.87% for the patent license and of 2.98% for the information license). The EU found these royalty fees unreasonable and Microsoft was ordered to lower them. Microsoft complied with this, adjusting the royalty rates to 1.2% (changing the rates for the licenses to 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively) in the European Union, while keeping the rate the same for the rest of the world. The EU still saw this as an unreasonable rate, and Microsoft, two months after lowering the rates, reduced the rates yet again to a flat rate of ‚Ç¨10,000 or a royalty of 0.4% applicable worldwide. Microsoft's royalty rates, which were deemed unreasonable for the period of 15 months between June 21, 2006 and October 21, 2007 are the cause for the fine. So far, the EU has fined Microsoft ‚Ç¨1.68 billion in 3 separate fines in this case. This fine will go towards the European Union annual budget. European Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes stated that the fine was \\"reasonable and proportionate,\\" as the figure could have gone up as high as ‚Ç¨1.5 billion, the maximum that the EU commission can impose. She also said that it should act as \\"a signal to the outside world, and especially Microsoft, that they should stick to the rules\\" and that \\"Talk is cheap. Flouting the rules is expensive.\\" Although she also expressed hope that \\"today's decision closes a dark chapter in Microsoft's record of non-compliance with the Commission.\\" It is not certain whether Microsoft will appeal this decision. A Microsoft spokesperson has stated that Microsoft will review this latest fine, citing that \\"The commission announced in October 2007 that Microsoft was in full compliance with the 2004 decision, so these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved.\\" Microsoft's General Counsel Brad Smith commented \\"It's clearly very important to us as a company that we comply with our obligations under European law. We will study this decision carefully, and if there are additional steps that we need to take in order to comply with it, we will take them.\\" Microsoft had appealed against fines by the EU before, but all the charges were defeated. If Microsoft does not appeal the decision, the company will have 3 months (starting February 27) to pay the fine in full. The decisions came after Microsoft announced they were disclosing 30,000 pages of previously secret software code last Thursday (February 21). The EU competition commissioner commented that this move \\"does not necessarily equal a change in business practice.\\" Spanish antitrust investigation In September 2011, the competition commission in Spain began an investigation into Microsoft's licence agreements, which prevent the transfer of Microsoft software to third parties. =United States= United States v. Microsoft Corp., 87 F. Supp. 2d 30 (D.D.C. 2000) was a set of consolidated civil actions filed against Microsoft Corporation on May 18, 1998 by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and twenty U.S. states. Joel I. Klein was the lead prosecutor. The plaintiffs alleged that Microsoft abused monopoly power in its handling of operating system sales and web browser sales. The issue central to the case was whether Microsoft was allowed to bundle its flagship Internet Explorer (IE) web browser software with its Microsoft Windows operating system. Bundling them together is alleged to have been responsible for Microsoft's victory in the browser wars as every Windows user had a copy of Internet Explorer. It was further alleged that this unfairly restricted the market for competing web browsers (such as Netscape Navigator or Opera) that were slow to download over a modem or had to be purchased at a store. Underlying these disputes were questions over whether Microsoft altered or manipulated its application programming interfaces (APIs) to favor Internet Explorer over third party web browsers, Microsoft's conduct in forming restrictive licensing agreements with OEM computer manufacturers, and Microsoft's intent in its course of conduct. Microsoft stated that the merging of Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer was the result of innovation and competition, that the two were now the same product and were inextricably linked together and that consumers were now getting all the benefits of IE for free. Those who opposed Microsoft's position countered that the browser was still a distinct and separate product which did not need to be tied to the operating system, since a separate version of Internet Explorer was available for Mac OS. They also asserted that IE was not really free because its development and marketing costs may have kept the price of Windows higher than it might otherwise have been. The case was tried before U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. The DOJ was initially represented by David Boies. On June 30, 2004, the U.S. appeals court unanimously approved the settlement with the Justice Department, rejecting objections that the sanctions were inadequate. Other In March 2004, during a consumer class- action lawsuit in Minnesota, internal documents subpoenaed from Microsoft revealed that the company had violated nondisclosure agreements seven years earlier in obtaining business plans from Go Corporation, using them to develop and announce a competing product named PenWindows, and convincing Intel to reduce its investment in Go. After Go was purchased by AT&T; and Go's tablet- based computing efforts were shelved, PenWindows development was dropped. In May 2004, a class-action lawsuit accused Microsoft of overcharging customers in the state of California. The company settled the case for $1.1 billion, and a California court ordered Microsoft to pay an additional $258 million in legal fees (including over $3,000 per hour for the lead attorney in the case, more than $2,000 per hour for colleagues, and in excess of $1,000 per hour for administrative work). A Microsoft attorney responded, \\"Somebody ends up paying for this. These large fee awards get passed on to consumers.\\" The total bill for legal fees was later reduced to just over $112 million. Because of the structure of the settlement, the law firm which sued Microsoft could end up getting more money from the company than California consumers and schools, the beneficiaries of the settlement. In 2006, Microsoft initiated an investigation of Lithuanian government institutions for determining whether they choose long-term strategies of the software they use correctly. The investigation, funded by Microsoft itself, will be performed by the Vilnius University together with the Lithuanian Institution of the Free Market, a think tank organization. The investigation was initialised after the government started to prepare 860 thousand litas project to encourage the use of open-source software. The vice-president of Microsoft, Vahe Torossian, stated that \\"the government should not be technologically subjectivist\\". Microsoft was sued for the \\"Windows Vista Capable\\" logo and in Iowa. Microsoft Word was also a subject of court case. On July 12, 2013, Microsoft is suing the U.S. Customs and Border Protection over Google phone ban. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is also named in the lawsuit. Private Microsoft has also fought numerous legal battles against private companies. The most prominent ones are against: * Alcatel-Lucent, which won US$1.52 billion in a lawsuit which alleged that Microsoft had infringed its patents on playback of audio files. This ruling was overturned in a higher court. * Apple Inc. (known as Apple Computer, Inc. at the time), which accused Microsoft in the late 1980s of copying the \\"look and feel\\" of the graphical user interface of Apple's operating systems. The courts ruled in favor of Microsoft in 1994. Another suit by Apple accused Microsoft, along with Intel and the San Francisco Canyon Company, in 1995 of knowingly stealing several thousand lines of QuickTime source code in an effort to improve the performance of Video for Windows.Markoff, John. \\"Intel and Microsoft Added to Apple Lawsuit\\", New York Times, 1995-02-10Duncan, Geoff. \\"Apple Sues Intel, Microsoft ‚Äì Again' , TidBITS, 1995-02-13Mace, Michael. \\"An Open Letter to the Computing Community\\", archived from apple.com, 1995-02-09Mace, Michael. \\"Second open letter from Apple\\", archived from apple.com After a threat to withdraw support for Office for Mac,Chalmers, Rachel. \\"Apple And Microsoft: Jobs Barefoot Under A Tree\\", Computergram International, 1999-01-26 this lawsuit was ultimately settled in 1997. Apple agreed to make Internet Explorer the default browser over Netscape, and Microsoft agreed to continue developing Office and other software for the Mac for the next 5 years, purchase $150 million of non-voting Apple stock, and made a quiet payoff estimated to be in the US$500 million-$2 billion range.Kawamoto, Dawn; Heskett, Ben; Ricciuti, Mike. \\"MS to invest $150 million in Apple\\", CNET News, 1997-08-06\\"Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement\\", FindLaw, 1997-08-05Eran, Daniel \\"Mac Office, $150 Million, and the Story Nobody Covered\\", Roughly Drafted, Sunday, 2007-03-11Every, David K., , MacKiDo, 1999 * AOL, on behalf of its Netscape division.

Retrieved 2015-01-22. * Be Inc., which accused Microsoft of exclusionary and anticompetitive behavior intended to drive Be out of the market. Be even offered to license its Be Operating System (BeOS) for free to any PC vendors who would ship it pre- installed, but the vendors declined due to what Be believes were fears of pricing retaliation from Microsoft: by raising the price of Microsoft Windows for one particular PC vendor, Microsoft could price that vendor's PCs out of the market. * Bristol Technology, which accused Microsoft illegally withheld Windows source code and used its dominant position with Windows to move into other markets. A ruling later ordered Microsoft to pay $1 million to Bristol Technologies (see also Windows Interface Source Environment). * Caldera, Inc. in 1996, accused Microsoft of several anti-competitive practices, including vaporware announcements, creating FUD, exclusionary licensing and artificial tying. One of the claims was down to bundling and tying MS-DOS 7 and Windows 4 into a single product (Windows 95) for the sole purpose of eliminating competition, another to having modified Windows 3.1 so that it would not run on DR DOS 6.0 although there was no technical reason for it not to work. Several industry experts revealed that Microsoft put encrypted code, which became known as AARD code, in five otherwise unrelated Microsoft programs in order to prevent the functioning of DR DOS in pre-releases (beta versions) of Windows 3.1, (xviii+856+vi pages, 3.5-inch floppy) Errata: and that it was technically possible to run Windows 4 on DR-DOS 7 after bypassing some new and non-essential interface code through WinGlue. In 2000, Microsoft settled out- of-court for an undisclosed sum, which in 2009 was revealed to be 280 million dollars, (NB. This document of the Caldera v. Microsoft case was an exhibit in the later Comes v. Microsoft case.) and the Caldera evidence was destroyed in 2003. * Opera Software, which accused Microsoft of intentionally making its MSN service incompatible with the Opera browser on several occasions. * Sendo, which accused Microsoft of terminating their partnership so it could steal Sendo's technology to use in Pocket PC 2002 Phone Edition. * Spyglass, which licensed its browser to Microsoft in return for a percentage of each sale; Microsoft turned the browser into Internet Explorer and bundled it with Windows, giving it away to gain market share but effectively destroying any chance of Spyglass making money from the deal they had signed with Microsoft; Spyglass sued for deception and won a $8 million settlement. * Stac Electronics, which accused Microsoft of stealing its data compression code and using it in MS-DOS 6.0. Microsoft eventually lost the subsequent Stac v. Microsoft lawsuit and was ordered by a federal court to pay roughly $120 million in compensation.Microsoft Loses Case On Patent By Lawrence M. Fisher, Published: 1994-02-24 * Sun Microsystems, which held Microsoft in violation of contract for including a modified version of Java in Microsoft Windows that provided Windows-specific extensions to Sun's Java language; Microsoft lost this decision in court and were forced to stop shipping their Windows-specific Java virtual machine. Microsoft eventually ceased to include any Java Virtual Machine in Windows, and Windows users who require a Java Virtual Machine need to download the software or otherwise acquire a copy from a source other than Microsoft. * Zhongyi Electronic, which, having licensed two self-designed fonts to Microsoft for use only in Windows 95, filed suit in China in April, 2007, accusing Microsoft of using those fonts in subsequent Windows 98, 2000, XP, 2003 and four other Chinese-language Windows operating systems. Beijing's No. 1 intermediate people's court ruled on November 16, 2009 that Microsoft violated the scope of licensing agreements between the two companies. The result of the verdict is that Microsoft has to stop selling Chinese-language versions of the aforementioned operating systems. Microsoft said it will appeal. One of the fonts in question may be SimSun. * Many other smaller companies have filed patent abuse and predatory practice suits against Microsoft. Patents =Alcatel-Lucent= The dispute between Microsoft and Lucent (and later Alcatel-Lucent) began in 2003 when Lucent Technologies (acquired by Alcatel in 2006) filed suit against Gateway in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego. Lucent also sued Dell in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia; soon thereafter, that court transferred the Dell case to San Diego, where it was consolidated with the case against Gateway. Lucent claimed in this first San Diego case that Dell and Gateway had violated patents on MP3-related technologies developed by Bell Labs, a division of predecessor company American Telephone & Telegraph. Other patents said to be infringed relate to MPEG video technology, speech technology, internet technology, and other technologies. Microsoft intervened in the lawsuit in April 2003 and Alcatel was added after it acquired Lucent. After the first San Diego lawsuit was filed, Microsoft and Lucent have filed additional patent lawsuits against each other. In February 2007, Microsoft filed a lawsuit at the International Trade Commission claiming that Alcatel-Lucent infringed its patents. There is a second case in San Diego where Microsoft is asserting that Alcatel-Lucent infringes 10 of its patents, and yet another case in Texas where each alleges that the other is infringing its patents. =Burst.com= * Burst.com claims that Microsoft stole Burst's patented technology for delivering high speed streaming sound and video content on the internet. Also at issue in the case is a 35-week period of missing emails in the evidence Microsoft handed over to Burst which was discovered by Burst.com's lawyers. Burst accuses Microsoft of crafting a 30-day email deletion policy specifically to cover up illegal activity. Microsoft settled with the company for $60 million in exchange for an agreement to license some of the company's technologies. =Eolas= * Eolas and University of California, which accused Microsoft of using some of its software patents in their web browser, won $521 million in court, however in 2012 Eolas' patents were invalidated. =SurfCast= SurfCast is suing Microsoft for infringing patent on Live Tiles. Copyrights =Apple= Apple Computer Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation, 35 F.3d 1435 (9th Cir. 1994) was a copyright infringement lawsuit in which Apple Computer, Inc. (now Apple Inc.) sought to prevent Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-Packard from using visual graphical user interface (GUI) elements that were similar to those in Apple's Lisa and Macintosh operating systems. Some critics claimed that Apple was really attempting to gain all intellectual property rights over the desktop metaphor for computer interfaces, and perhaps all GUIs, on personal computers. Apple lost all claims in the lawsuit, except that the court ruled that the \\"trash can\\" icon and file folder icons from Hewlett-Packard's now- forgotten NewWave windows application were infringing. The lawsuit was filed in 1988 and lasted four years; the decision was affirmed on appeal in 1994, and Apple's appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied. Trademarks =Lindows= Microsoft v. Lindows.com, Inc. was a court case brought on December 20, 2001, by Microsoft against Lindows, Inc, claiming that the name \\"Lindows\\" was a violation of its trademark \\"Windows.\\" In addition to the United States, Microsoft has also sued Lindows in Sweden, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Canada. Michael Robertson has called this situation \\"Sextuple Jeopardy\\", an extension of the term double jeopardy. In response to these lawsuits, Lindows had launched ChoicePC.com, which allows people to purchase lifetime Lindows memberships that includes a free copy of LindowsOS, free LindowsOS upgrades for life, and a ChoicePC.com T-shirt, for US$100. All money from the memberships goes towards helping Lindows in its legal battle against Microsoft. =MikeRoweSoft= In a legal dispute, Microsoft sued a Canadian high school student named Mike Rowe over the domain name MikeRoweSoft.com. The case received international press attention following Microsoft's perceived heavy handed approach to a 12th grade student's part-time web design business and the subsequent support that Rowe received from the online community. A settlement was eventually agreed, with Rowe granting ownership of the domain to Microsoft in return for training and gifts. , the domain MikeRoweSoft.com still redirects to microsoft.com. =Shah= Microsoft sued several parties for contributory cybersquatting‚Äîthat is, encouraging others (through software and instructional videos) to cybersquat on domain names that infringed on Microsoft's trademarks. Microsoft prevailed in court and also established a precedent that liabilities under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) include contributory trademark infringement. =Windows Commander= From 1993 until 2002, Total Commander was called Windows Commander; the name was changed in 2002, out of fear of a lawsuit after the developers received a letter from Microsoft pointing out that the word \\"windows\\" was trademarked by Microsoft. =wxWindows= The wxWindows project was renamed to wxWidgets in September 2003 out of fear of a lawsuit after the founder developer Julian Smart received a letter from Microsoft pointing out that the 'Windows' is a UK trademark owned by Microsoft. =Microwindows= The Microwindows project was renamed to Nano-X Window System in January 2005, due to legal threats from Microsoft regarding the Windows trademark. Other * Microsoft v. Internal Revenue Service =Xbox 360= Microsoft has been accused of deceiving consumers by concealing the high failure rate of its Xbox 360 game console. A woman from California sued Microsoft on October 2008 in Superior Court in Sacramento County, stating that the company violated multiple state consumer- protection and unfair-competition laws. The woman alleged that the company continued to sell the Xbox 360 even though it knew that the console's hardware was likely to fail.

It is unusual in that it was not abandoned until the 20th century. The village was recorded in 1268 under the name of Snape. It was always a small place: in the 14th century there were 19 poll-tax payers, in 1773 there were between 5 and 10 cottages and in the 1851 Census the population was 41. In 1905, Henry Wilson, a butcher from Ramsbury, bought the two farms in the village and converted them from arable to sheep farming, which deprived the villagers of their work. By 1909 there were only 2 residents, and by 1914 the village was deserted. Most of the buildings were destroyed when the site was used for military training in the First World War, and were later plundered for building materials. Only earthworks are now visible. The name is remembered in Snap Farm. The site lies near the Ridgeway National Trail. References * Victoria County History of Wiltshire: Aldbourne * Abandoned Communities ...

After completing the opera The Rake's Progress, Stravinsky felt the urge to compose another work setting English words, but in a non-dramatic form . The piece consists of the following movements: For his texts, Stravinsky chose four anonymous fifteenth- and sixteenth-century poems found in , an anthology of poetry presented to him as a Christmas gift by W. H. Auden, the librettist of his opera, The Rakes's Progress . The dirge sections concern a soul's approach to and journey through purgatory.

It also appeared on the Yugoslav new wave compilation Paket aran≈æman which is one of the most important Yugoslav rock releases.  History  Vlada Divljan, the member of Idoli wanted to create a song which would be a parody on the Soviet Socialist realism. Prior to the release of Maljƒçiki, Idoli had written songs about freedom of love like \\"Retko te viƒëam sa devojkama\\" (re-released as the B-side on the single) but had not done anything explicitly political. The Soviet embassy condemned the release of the song. The song depicts a sort of Stakhanov-like proletarian who enthusiastically wakes up in the early dawn to go to work in a mine and a metallurgy factory. The official release of the song featured the following lyrics: \\"Plamene zore bude me iz sna; Fabriƒçka jutra, dim iz dimnjaka\\" (\\"Dawns on fire, wake me from my dream; Factory mornings, smoke from the chimney\\"). However, the original unreleased version of the lyrics was: \\"Kakane zore, bude me iz sna; Kakana jutra, kakan sam i ja\\" (\\"Shitty dawns, wake me from my dream; Shitty mornings, I am also shitty\\"). But when the band entered the studio with the producer Goran Bregoviƒá, the record label Jugoton did not want to release the song with these lyrics, so they were changed. The song also included ethnic Russian music elements and some nonsensical Russian language lyrics that nobody from the band could understand. The Russian language part on the officially released version was narrated by Dragan Papiƒá who was the band's manager at that time. A re- recorded version of \\"Maljƒçiki\\" was included on Paket aran≈æman compilation. By that time the band was playing on a more expensive equipment which can be heard on this version. The record was produced by Enco Lesiƒá. A live version of \\"Maljƒçiki\\" was included on Vlada Divljan's live album Odbrana i Za≈°tita.  Promotional video  Promotional video for \\"Maljƒçiki\\" followed the release of the Paket aran≈æman compilation. The video featured a parody of soc-realist iconography, for example actors posing as miners and metallurgy workers, while the band members, dressed formally in suits and ties posed as apparatchiks. It was broadcast for a first time at the New Year's Eve on the then-popular \\"Rokenroler\\" show on the national television. SFR Yugoslavia was not a member of the Eastern Bloc but a Non-aligned country, so the band did not have any specific problems with the authorities concerning the release of the song and video. However, the Soviet embassy sent a protest note to the TV and radio stations which broadcast the song and some of them banned it. Even though the band was playing on a good professional equipment, in the video they intentionally used old Slovene and Czech instruments to adjust with the whole concept of the song. The Russian narration part was done on lip sync by ≈†aper even though the original was recorded by Papiƒá.  Track listing  # \\"Maljƒçiki\\" (S. ≈†aper, V.

The version contains lyrics in Polish and a Russian narrative part from the original lyric. The track was performed by Kazik and Vlada Divljan, who participated the recording, sang backing vocals and did the narration part of the song.

They can vary in size and have been found worldwide. Pockmarks were discovered off the coasts of Nova Scotia, Canada in the late 1960s by Lew King and Brian McLean of the Bedford Institute of Oceanography. They were discovered off Nova Scotia, using a new side scan sonar developed in the late 1960s by Kelvin Hughes. Before the two researchers King and McLean used the side scan sonar, they had noticed 'notches' on echo sounder and shallow seismic records in the seafloor off Nova Scotia. They believed these notches to represent gullies and curvilinear troughs in the muddy seafloor. However, they could never work out how to join these notches from one survey line to the next. It was, therefore, not before they surveyed with the area-coverage system, Side scan sonar, that they realized the notches were in fact closed depressions (craters) and not curvilinear features. This was a great surprise, because there are very few craters on the Earth's surface. Although pockmarks were first documented and published 50 years ago, they are currently still being discovered on the ocean floor and in many lakes, the world over. The craters off Nova Scotia are up to in diameter and deep. Pockmarks have been found worldwide.Judd, Alan and Martin Hovland, 'Seabed Fluid Flow: The Impact on Geology, Biology and the Marine Environment, Cambridge University Press, 2007, Hovland, Martin, Seabed Pockmarks and Seepages : Geological Ecological and Environmental Implication, Springer, 1988, Discovery was aided by the use of high-resolution multibeam acoustic systems for bathymetric mapping. In these cases, pockmarks have been interpreted as the morphological expression of gas or oil leakage from active hydrocarbon system or a deep overpressured petroleum reservoir.

Snakes of the Agkistrodon Complex: A Monographic Review. Oxford, Ohio: Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles. 614 pp. 52 plates. LCCN 89-50342. . is a venomous pitviper species endemic to Sri Lanka. The smallest member of its genus, it is distinguished by having a strongly upturned nose and lower scale counts. No subspecies are currently recognized. Etymology The specific name, walli, is in honor of Ceylonese-born British herpetologist Frank Wall.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Hypnale walli, p. 279). Description The smallest member of the genus Hypnale, the only male with a complete tail measured in total length with a tail of (14% of total length), while the largest female was in total length with a tail of (12% of total length). The body is stoutly built. This species is distinguished from H. hypnale by a snout that has a strongly upturned tip. This is due to an extended rostral scale, which is immediately followed by a raised wart-like hump covered with 10 minute scales. Also, the hemipenes have clearly visible spines. It is distinguished from H. nepa by its lower scale counts. The scalation includes 17 rows of dorsal scales at midbody that usually lack keels, 7 supralabial scales, 120-126 ventral scales, and 28-33 subcaudal scales. Regarding the color pattern, Gloyd and Conant (1990) examined a number of preserved specimens, mentioning that some were so faded as to render the pattern almost invisible. One of these, however, had a faint narrow stripe down the center of its back. In general, the color pattern is described as consisting of a series of 18-24 dorsolateral small subtriangular brown blotches, pointing upwards. These are slightly darker than the ground color, except for the upper edges that may be considerably darker. A pair of dark brown blotches are present on the side of the head, along with a pair of dark stripes curving backward on the sides of the neck. The ventral surface is strongly flecked and dappled with grayish brown. Geographic range Hypnale walli is found in Sri Lanka. The type locality given is \\"Kanneliya Forest, Udugama Southern Province, Ceylon [Sri Lanka], elevation approximately \\". Taxonomy According to Gloyd and Conant (1990), the taxonomic status of this species is unclear. Although described here as a species, it may eventually be classified as a subspecies of H. nepa, or even as the minimum extreme for H. nepa with regard to its low ventral and subcaudal scale counts, as well as its relatively short tail.

It is one of a number of seismic sources used in reflection seismology.Robert E. Sheriff, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Applied Geophysics (Geophysical References No. 13) 4th Edition, 2002, 429 pag. . The ‚ÄòVibroseis‚Äô exploration technique (performed with vibrators) was developed by the Continental Oil Company (Conoco) during the 1950s and was a trademark until the company's patent lapsed.Anstey, Nigel A., Vibroseis, Prentice Hall, 1991. Today, seismic vibrators are used to perform about half of all seismic surveys on land. The largest seismic vibration truck in the world, known as 'Nomad 90‚Äô, weighs 41.5T and has a 90,000 lbf force. Principle A seismic vibrator transforms the energy provided by a diesel engine into a vibration. It is performed by a shaker, a movable element that generates the vibration thanks to a piston-reaction mass device driven by an electrohydraulic servo valve. The shaker is applied to the ground for each vibration, then raised up so that the seismic vibrator can move to another vibrating point.Li d th R O Lindseth, Roy O., Di it l P i f G h i l D t Digital Processing of Geophysical Data‚Äî A Review, originally published 1968, SEG Course Notes, 1982, 282 pages, Catalog #251A Vibrator capability is defined by the maximum force it is capable to generate, called High Peak Force and measured in pound-force. To transmit a maximum force to the ground and prevent the shaker from bumping, part of the weight of the vibrator is applied to the shaker. Popular culture The plot of Ken Follett's 1998 thriller The Hammer of Eden turns on the use of a stolen seismic vibrator truck by ecoterrorists.

It is the administrative centre of Tsenovo Municipality, which lies in the western part of Ruse Province. It is located along the lower course of the Yantra River, in the central Danubian Plain, 32 kilometres from Svishtov and 45 kilometres from the provincial capital of Rousse. The modern village was founded in the late 16th-early 17th century as the farm of the G√ºlhane Park administrator at the imperial palace of Topkapƒ± in Istanbul, named Kara Ali. The settlement gradually grew, as many people settled around the inn; the village was first named √áau≈ühan and √áau≈ük√∂y.

World War II history During the German Invasion of Poland in 1939, Wehrmacht soldiers on 13 September took 50 males (43 Poles and 7 Jews) out of homes and ordered them to repair a damaged bridge. After the work was completed the German soldiers shot all of them. Another massacre took place later in which 50 Jews were executed.Szymon Datner, \\"55 dni Wehrmachtu w Polsce\\", pp. 373-375. Warszawa, Wydawn. Ministerstwa Obrony Narodowej, 1967. Before the war around 1300 Jews lived in PiƒÖtek. After the German occupation in September, a few hundred fled. In late 1940, the remaining 840 Jews were confined to a ghetto and stripped of their possessions. Many Jews in the PiƒÖtek ghetto died of starvation and disease due to limited food and severe overcrowding. In 1941, hundreds were taken to labor camps. In 1942, German police began randomly shooting Jews and in August 1942 rounded them up and shot those who were ill and elderly in the local cemetery. Others were sent to the Lodz ghetto. Most were sent to the Chelmno extermination camp where they were immediately gassed. Only a few of PiƒÖtek's Jews survived the war.

On the other hand, Yankees general manager Gabe Paul ordered Patterson to play winter ball in Venezuela, neglecting his workload of nearly 500 innings in a span of two seasons and Patterson, at 21, did as he was told. Patterson opened 1977 at Syracuse before joining the Yankees in the month of April. He soon felt a popping sensation in his arm and fooled people for a while, but deep down and, according to his own words, he knew he would never be the same. Patterson would only pitch in ten games for New York in the season, ending with a record of 1‚Äì2 and a 5.40 ERA. He then was done in the majors due to arm pain. Afterwards, Patterson had eight operations and was unable to pitch for over two years. While recovering, he started the process of teaching himself to pitch left-handed to return to professional baseball. Additionally, he continued to try to get the right arm ready to go. At the beginning, Patterson threw the ball hard, but the ball would not even bounced back and had relapses in the process. Eventually, he received advice from pitching legend Whitey Ford and pitched in a spring training game left-handed. He was fine, but continued to throw right handed in the minor leagues during three seasons. His comeback started on a high note, as he was 5‚Äì2 with a 1.58 ERA in eight starts for Rookie Class Gulf Coast League Yankees in 1980, finishing fourth in the league in ERA. In 1981, he was 1‚Äì4 with a 3.20 ERA for Class-A Fort Lauderdale Yankees, and then 1‚Äì1, 1.33 ERA for Class-A Fresno Giants in 1982 to complete his revival bid, but did not return to the majors. He compiled a 33‚Äì16 record with a 2.37 ERA in 63 minor league appearances (62 starts). Coaching career Patterson was out of baseball by 1983, though he held out hope for a comeback. He took a job parking cars at a restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in which he threw left-handed against the outside walls after closing. The Yankees made their spring training in town, and its owner George Steinbrenner went to the restaurant one night and recognized Patterson. Steinbrenner offered him a coaching job, but it did not last long. As a result, Patterson began his coaching career in 1984 with his first team, the Oneonta Yankees, but would not let history repeat. He then was dismissed after the season for refusing to let the then 19-year-old prospect Al Leiter pitch with a sore arm. In 1991, Patterson joined the Oakland Athletics organization, where he served as the pitching coach for the Madison Muskies from 1992 to 1993 and the West Michigan Whitecaps in 1994. Then in 1996, he was the roving minor league instructor. In between, when arm problems jeopardized Leiter's career, Patterson rebuilt the delivery of his longtime friend and neighbor, as Leiter rejuvenated his career and kept pitching until he was 40 years old. Patterson later worked in the Arizona Diamondbacks system as their minor league pitching coordinator from 1997 to 2000. After that, he got a job with the Toronto Blue Jays as their bullpen coach in 2001 and then as their pitching coach from 2002 through 2004. In 2005, Patterson rejoined the Yankees and worked as pitching coach for Triple-A Columbus Clippers, being reassigned to the GCL Yankees from 2006 to 2007. Patterson had asked for the assignment to work in the Gulf Coast minor league farm team, where there are no overnight trips and the schedule allowed him to be home by the late afternoon. At that time, Patterson decided he had to stay home to be close to his 7-year-old son, who had been diagnosed with Tourette syndrome, a condition of the nervous system characterized by involuntary, uncontrolled movements and vocalizations called tics. From 2008 to 2012, Patterson served as the minor league pitching coordinator for the Athletics. He took over the same post with the Yankees from 2013 to 2015, and came back to Oakland in 2016 for his third stint in the organization as the head of the Athletics' minor league pitching program.Oakland A's Coaching Q&A;: Minor League Pitching Coordinator Gil Patterson.

It serves the MBTA Ashmont‚ÄìMattapan High Speed Line. It is located on Capen Street off Eliot Street; the westernmost of the four MBTA stations in Milton, it consists of two side platforms flanking the eponymous street's grade crossing. The platforms are staggered to allow trains to make the stop at Capen Street before crossing the street itself, as there is no signal at the grade crossing. Capen Street is accessible via wooden ramps on both platforms. Capen Street opened in September 1930 as an infill station on the line. History Capen Street in 1930, shortly after opening Inbound platform at Capen Street in 2016 The Dorchester and Milton Branch Railroad opened from Neponset to Mattapan in December 1847. Service was discontinued on August 26, 1929, as the new high-speed trolley line was completed from Ashmont to Milton by the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy). The trolley line was extended from Milton to Mattapan on December 21, 1929, with new intermediate stops at Central Avenue and Valley Road. Residents on Capen Street, having to use the Valley Road stop despite the line crossing Capen Street, requested a station of their own; it was considered a likely possibility at the time of the line's opening. After considering the walking distance from Capen Street to Valley Road and Mattapan, the BERy granted the request. The Boston Transit Department constructed by gravel platforms with overhead lighting. The completed station opened as a flag stop in September 1930. A second infill stop at Butler Street opened the next year. On October 8, 1982, a shotgun-wielding man attempted to rob the six passengers aboard an inbound trolley at Capen Street. One of the passengers foiled the attempt by grabbing the unloaded gun from the robber. The MBTA closed the line on June 24, 2006 to allow a new viaduct to be constructed at Ashmont station. During the closure, all stations on the line were modernized and (except for Valley Road) made accessible. The old shelter and platforms were replaced by modern platforms with canopies, with a wooden ramp on each platform for accessibility. Trolley service resumed on December 22, 2007.

It is located in Landsveit, South Iceland. The cave is almost long and the walls are covered with engravings. Its age is unknown but it is most probably from 12th or 13th century. Hellar in Landsveit is a farm in the southern part of Iceland, approximately one and a half hours drive from Reykjav√≠k. To those who in one way or another root from there, this place is one of great beauty, intriguing family history, happy memories and the marvellous adventures of childhood. To others Hellar is mostly known as the place where you find Hellnahellir, Iceland's biggest manmade cave. Hellnahellir Hellnahellir is Iceland's biggest man made cave, approximately 50 meters long. It has two exits, one at each end, and five chimneys built up from the ceiling whose purpose is likely to have been to provide daylight and perhaps to allow smoke from fireplaces to escape from the cave. The cave is built into the mountain Skar√∞sfjall and lies far enough beneath the surface for it to be free of frost in the winter. In fact the temperature in the cave is about the same the whole year round. The name Hellnahellir roughly translates into The Cave at Caves ‚Äì hellir meaning cave and Hellar being both the name of the farm where Hellnahellir is located and also plural for the word cave. Origins It will probably never be known for certain how old Hellnahellir really is. Some believe that the cave, or at least some parts of it, was dug out and lived in by Papar, Irish monks who dwelled in Iceland shortly before the Vikings settled in, around the year 900. If this is really the case it makes the cave just about 1,000 years old. Cross marks on the walls and a somewhat large niche, dug into the wall in one place and believed to be the something of an altar, are among the things that support this theory. If the Irish monks were not responsible for building Hellnahellir it must instead have been built by the farmers living in the area sometime between the years 900 and 1332 because in documents from the latter year the name of the farm, Hellar (Caves), turns up. Since the name of the farm so obviously derives from the existence of caves on the premises it shows that there must have been at least more than one cave there at the time, and what is more, impressive enough to give the farm its name. These facts therefore make Hellnahellir at least 700 years old. Hellnahellir's original purpose is a bit dependent on the time when it was built but the later it happened we can suppose it becomes less likely to have been inhabited by people. On there are questions about why it has all those chimneys in the ceiling if its sole purpose was to house farm animals, hay or food which would not have needed that much daylight and certainly no smoke-spewing fireplaces. No archaeological remains have been found in the cave which can support theories about its origin in one way or another. It is however quite clear that Hellnahellir is made by man, dug out of sandstone with the primitive tools of the time when it was made. The opening of Hellnahellir The front half of Hellnahellir, the area closest to the barn was used for a long time to store hay in the winter. The other half was at the same time full of loose sand, so much of it that there was only about enough space for a person to crawl between the sand and the ceiling ‚Äì if in fact anyone had the unlikely urge or the nerve to be crawling about in such a confined and dark place. The sand was finally removed from this end of the cave in the years around 1950, leaving the cave in about the same state it is now. It is not clear when all this sand entered the cave but landslides coming from the mountain above are however the reason it came to be there. Since big earthquakes have frequently shaken this area through the years, it being both in the neighbourhood of the famous volcano Hekla and also in a part of Iceland which is subject to large earthquakes several times each century, there are ample opportunities for this to have happened. Since the grassy green mountainside above the cave does not bear any signs of landslides nowadays, it seems clear that the sand must have entered the cave some centuries ago. In Icelandic historical references regarding farmland in Iceland, written in 1702‚Äì1714, it says that landslides spoilt fields at the Hellar farm which perhaps refers to the ones that fell into the cave. The descriptions are not accurate enough though for anything but speculations and it could just as well refer to other landslides, elsewhere on the mountain. Although those landslides must have been a great curse to whoever lived at this farm at the time, they may have been something of a blessing in disguise for Hellnahellir. This is because the landslides have put a several-metres-thick layer of earth on top of the cave essentially putting it farther into the ground than it originally was. The layer of earth contributes to a better preservation of the cave as a form of insulation that makes the temperature inside it more even and the cave less likely to be subject to frost and water damages. The Singing-Cave Cow-farming was discontinued at Hellar farm in 1982 and since then Hellnahellir has not been used to store hay in it. Its occupation nowadays is mostly to be viewed by those travellers interested in taking a look at it and to house a few gatherings that have been held there in recent years. The acoustics in Hellnahellir are quite good so concerts have been held there on several occasions and in the year 2000 the bishop of Iceland even held mass in the cave. Those happenings have made this cave known to some people as The Singing-Cave rather than by its actual name Hellnahellir. The calf that got lost in Hellnahellir  Hellnahellir has the old legend that a small calf stumbled into the cave and got lost. To look for the poor little calf a workman was sent in after it who wandered around in the cave in the darkness for some time without any success in finding the calf. When the workman however heard the humming of a river on top of his head he got scared and turned back. When he returned to the surface, quite embarrassed with no calf to show for his efforts, there was golden sand in his shoes which he had unwittingly picked up along the way. The calf turned up several days later when the farmer at St√≥ri-N√∫pur, a farm at several kilometres distance away from Hellar and on the other side of √ûj√≥rs√°-river, heard mooing coming out from under his bed. Upon a closer look it turned out to be the calf that got lost in the cave, safe and sound except for its tail which it had somehow lost along the way.

The fictional heroes were based vaguely on their creators, the barbarian Fafhrd on the tall Leiber, and the thief The Gray Mouser on Fischer. During 1937, Fischer and Leiber designed a board game set in this fantasy world and each began composing a story with the same setting, Fischer's being \\"The Lords of Quarmall\\" and Leiber's \\"The Adventure of the Grain Ships.\\" Neither story was finished until much later; Fischer's work on \\"The Lords of Quarmall\\" amounted to 10,000 words of the eventual story, which was finished by Leiber. The first professional publication of a story featuring the heroes and their setting was \\"Two Sought Adventure\\", in Unknown magazine during 1939. This and most subsequent stories featuring the pair were written by Leiber, and all but one were set in the fantasy world Leiber and Fischer created. The original tales begun by Fischer and Leiber about the pair were completed by Leiber and published during the 1960s. \\"The Adventure of the Grain Ships\\" was finally published in the magazine Fantastic as \\"Scylla's Daughter\\" during 1961, and was later expanded into the novel The Swords of Lankhmar (1968); \\"The Lords of Quarmall\\" was finally published, also in Fantastic, during 1964. Fischer also wrote \\"The Childhood and Youth of the Gray Mouser,\\" published during 1978 in The Dragon #18.

After spending most of back in the minor leagues, Murray got another chance in , but fared little better, batting a paltry .186.

Education Manton earned his PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1978, under the supervision of Peter Goddard. His thesis was entitled Magnetic Monopoles and Other Extended Objects in Field Theory.  Research  Manton has made contributions to the theory of soliton- like particles in two and three dimensions. He calculated the forces between static and moving monopoles and vortices in gauge theories, leading to the geometrical idea of moduli space dynamics. This has been applied to the classical, quantum and statistical mechanics of solitons. He has also developed the theory of skyrmions as a soliton model of atomic nuclei. He discovered the unstable sphaleron solution in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model of particle physics. The Higgs field is topologically twisted within a sphaleron. The sphaleron defines an energy scale for baryon and lepton number violation in the early universe ‚Äî an energy scale within the range of the Large Hadron Collider. His other work includes the construction of a 10-dimensional theory containing supergravity and Yang‚ÄìMills theory, which is a low-energy limit of superstring theory.

Career Women with a tulip Leopold Gottlieb began his formal art education at the Academy of Fine Arts in Krak√≥w under the direction of Jacek Malczewski. After graduating the academy, he moved to Munich to continue his studies in the studio of Anton A≈æbe. In 1904, at the age of 21 he settled in Paris and became a member of the Circle of Montparnasse artists. During the years 1904-1907, he exhibited his works in group exhibitions with four other fellow artists in Krak√≥w, Lvov, Vienna, Berlin, and Warszawa. In 1910, he moved to Jerusalem to teach in the Bezalel School of Art. Following his return to Paris In the years 1917-1919, he took part in exhibition of Polish Expressionists (Formists) and became friends with another Polish artist, Moses Kisling, Eugene Zak and Mela Muter. His artistic talent was acknowledged by the esteemed critics of that time, Andr√© Salmon and Adolf Basler, and his works were displayed in the Salon of Autumn, Independents, Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux Artes, and the Tuileries. He participated in exhibitions in the Vienna Secession. He also participated in the exhibition of Polish art, organized in 1912, at Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona. First World War During the First World War he joined the Polish Legions. During his service in the Legions, he used to draw and document scenes depicting everyday life in the formation and the life of his fellow soldier commanders. His drawings and lithographs were presented in the \\"Exhibition of Polish Legions,\\" which took place in Lublin in 1917. After the war, he settled in Poland, moved to Vienna, and then to Germany. \\"Compassion\\" (Mi≈Çosierdzie), 1913 In 1926, he returned to Paris where he exhibited at the Galerie aux Quatre Chemins (1927), d'Art de Montparnasse (1928), Bonaparte (1930), and Zak (1934). In 1929 and 1930, he joined the exhibition of the Association of Polish Artists. Artistic style Gottlieb's paintings often depict biblical themes with range of brown, green, and pink pearl tones that intensify with linear rhythm. This rhythm makes the images gain characteristics of ritual ceremony or music. The content of his painting display a rich language of icons and symbols which are drawn from Christian iconography. Gottlieb also painted many portraits of famous people, including Diego Rivera and Helena Rubinstein.

Room dividers are used by interior designers and architects as means to divide space into separate distinct areas.A room divider for a conference hall. There are a number of different types of room dividers such as cubicle partitions, pipe and drape screens, shoji screens, and walls. Room dividers can be made from many materials, including wood, fabric, plexiglass, framed cotton canvas, pleated fabric or mirrors. Plants, shelves or railings might also be used as dividers. Portable room dividers have folded wall panels supported on wheels.  Types  In general, room dividers are used in one of these ways: * To divide rooms, creating a more efficient use of the space within the room. * As decorators and/or accent pieces to add character to room space. * To hide areas of different usage or privacy protection * To decorate rooms for better home design effect Room dividers differ in nature being either: * Permanent as in using wine shelves in restaurants * Built in as in sliding partitions in offices * Portable or temporary as for example in convention centers * Fixed room dividers and hanging room dividers They may completely obscure as in floor to ceiling dividers, or may allow sight through as for example when plant pots are used to divide areas  Uses  Houses, and other residences, use a room divider to divide the space more effectively or as a decorating focus point. There are many uses for a room divider including: dividing the room, adding privacy to any space, hiding clutter and increasing storage and accents to the room. Other uses include adding color, redirecting foot traffic, creating a foyer, adding a desk front modesty screen, creating coziness, or adding a decorative background. Most commonly used in the residence is a small room divider, sometimes called a folding shoji screen. Shoji screens are usually tri-fold walls. A shoji screen may also be used to section off part of a bedroom or family room as an office.Berner, Jeff: \\"The Joy of Working from Home\\", page 27. Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 1994.

In schools or religious facilities, room dividers primarily are used to create temporary classrooms for education in large open rooms.Marilyn Pierce Dornbush, Sheryl K. Pruitt: \\"Teaching the Tiger\\", page 110. Hope Press, 1995.Williams, Peter W.: \\"Houses of God\\", page 121. University of Illinois Press, 2000. Since the rooms were designed originally to be open for other purposes, the most common type of room divider is a portable room divider on casters which can easily be moved from place to place. After class, the room divider is rolled back into its storage area for future use. Hotels and restaurants use two different types of room dividers. Commonly, you will see floor-to-ceiling room dividersPile, John, F.: \\"Interior Design\\", Page 417. H.N. Abrams, 1995. in banquet halls and meeting spaces. These fixed dividers can be used to divide a banquet room into smaller facilities. In areas where room dividers need more flexibility, hotels and restaurants might use portable partitions similar to those used in schools. In offices, room dividers are typically more permanent in nature and attached directly to the floor. These office cubicles room dividers allow taking a large office space and breaking it into quieter and more focused subdivided offices.Meel, Juriaan van: \\"The European Office\\", Page 81. 010 Publishers, 2000. Convention centers, by their very nature, are large facilities with wide open internal spaces. Consequently, they often need to be broken down into smaller areas. The most common room divider used in convention center is pipe and drape.Hoyle, Leonard H., Dorf, David C., Jones, Thomas J. A.: \\"Managing Conventions and Group Business\\", page 28. Educational Institute of the American Hotel & Motel Association, 1989. The convention center sets up frames made of plastic, metal, or wire tubing. Fabric material is then hung over the frame to create back drops and hide other unsightly places in addition to creating multiple subdivided rooms. History The folding room screens were found in China in the 7th century where they were mainly used by royalty. They were very heavy and ornate, and were not moved around. In the 8th century, the Japanese began using lighter, more portable room dividers for tea ceremonies, religious events and outdoor processions. European travelers developed their own version of Asian screen dividers using wood, leather, silk, mirrors and decoupage.

Green, 328 U.S. 549 (1946), was a United States Supreme Court case. Writing for a 4‚Äì3 plurality, Justice Felix Frankfurter held that the federal judiciary had no power to interfere with issues regarding apportionment of state legislatures.Katz, Ellis. 2006. \\"Colegrove v. Green.\\" Federalism in America: An Encyclopedia..See Kim Isaac Eisler, A Justice for All: William J. Brennan, Jr., and the decisions that transformed America, 11, 168 (1993). The Court held that the Guarantee Clause in Article I, section IV of the U.S. Constitution left to the legislature of each state the authority to establish the time, place, and manner of holding elections for representatives, and that only Congress (and thus not the federal judiciary) could determine whether individual state legislatures had fulfilled their responsibility to secure fair representation for citizens.Colegrove, 328 U.S. at 554-55. However, in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962) the United States Supreme Court distinguished the Colegrove decision holding that malapportionment claims under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were not exempt from judicial review under Article IV, Section 4, as the equal protection issue in this case was separate from any political questions. The \\"one person, one vote\\" doctrine which requires electoral districts to be apportioned according to population, thus making each district roughly equal in population, was further cemented in the cases that followed Baker v. Carr, including Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368 (1963), which concerned state county districts; Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964), which concerned state legislature districts; Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1 (1964), which concerned U.S. Congressional districts; and Avery v. Midland County, 390 U.S. 474 (1968), which concerned local government districts, a decision which was upheld in Board of Estimate of City of New York v. Morris, 489 U.S. 688 (1989).  Ruling  Colegrove arose from the failure of Illinois to redistrict its Congressional delegation since 1901, despite internal migration that had left wide population disparities between various districts. Three voters sued, asserting what would now be known as malapportionment: a rural county of 1,000 and an urban county of 100,000 would have an equal vote. The court characterized the case as \\"an appeal to the federal courts to reconstruct the electoral process of Illinois in order that it may be adequately represented in the councils of the Nation. Because the Illinois legislature has failed to revise its Congressional Representative districts in order to reflect great changes, during more than a generation, in the distribution of its population, we are asked to do this, as it were, for Illinois.\\" The court decided that this was a nonjusticiable question: \\"The remedy for unfairness in districting is to secure State legislatures that will apportion properly, or to invoke the ample powers of Congress.\\"  Dissent by Justice Black  Dissenting, Justice Hugo Black argued that the Constitution required each citizen's vote carry equal weight.Eisler, 169. \\"While the Constitution contains no express provision requiring that congressional election districts established by the States must contain approximately equal populations,\\" Black wrote, \\"the constitutionally guaranteed right to vote, and the right to have one's vote counted clearly imply the policy that state election systems, no matter what their form, should be designed to give approximately equal weight to each vote cast.\\" Black thought it wrong that a citizen living in a district of 900,000 people had a much smaller percentage of a vote than someone living in a district with 112,000.  Plurality opinion  The Colegrove case was decided by a 4‚Äì3 plurality. Plurality opinions result when a majority of Justices (usually five or more but in this rare occasion, four) agree on the result in a particular case but no single rationale or opinion garners five votes. The case was voted on by seven rather than nine justices because Chief Justice Stone had just died, and Justice Robert Jackson had taken leave to serve as chief prosecutor of the Nuremberg Trials.  Aftermath  Critics of Colegrove complained that it deprived state citizens of federal remedies, and that the outdated apportionments ‚Äì dating to 1901, 45 years prior ‚Äì were the vehicle by which rural, conservative interests were allowed to keep a disproportionate influence over the country's politics. Until it was overruled by Baker, Colegrove made it almost impossible for citizens' groups to get help from the federal courts in apportioning legislative and congressional districts. An exception to the reach of Colegrove was allowed in a 1960 case called Gomillion v. Lightfoot, in which the appellants showed that the boundary lines of a district in Alabama had deliberately been drawn to minimize the voting rights of black residents. Frankfurter wrote the opinion in this case as well, making sure that Colegrove would not be seen as allowing blatant racial gerrymandering by recasting the issue as a Fifteenth Amendment case.Eisler, 169‚Äì170. One week after the Gomillion ruling was handed down, Justice Black persuaded his colleagues to hear arguments in Baker v. Carr, the case which would ultimately overrule Colegrove.Eisler, 170.

Early years Born in Russia, Vallin came to America while still young with his South American mother, Mrs. Nardine Thomes, on the S/S Muskegon, which arrived at the Port of Boston on May 6, 1922.  Career  In 1940, Vallin (billed as Eric Efron) acted on stage with the Hollytown Theater. Vallin started his Hollywood career with an uncredited part in the film Freshman Year and played minor roles in feature films at various studios.Freshman Year at IMDb.com In 1942 he joined the Pasadena Playhouse, and received his first co-star billing in the film The Panther's Claw together with Sidney Blackmer,The Panther's Claw at IMDb.com and showed promise in Secrets of a Co-Ed with Otto Kruger.Secrets of a Co-Ed at IMDb.com Vallin's fortunes improved in 1943 when he was hired as the villain in the East Side Kids comedy Clancy Street Boys. Producer Sam Katzman liked Vallin's darkly handsome looks and convincing delivery of dialogue, and cast him first as a juvenile lead (in Ghosts on the Loose) and then as a full-fledged leading man (in Vallin's only starring film, Smart Guy). When producer Katzman moved from Monogram Pictures to Columbia Pictures, he took Rick Vallin with him. This sealed Vallin's fate as a player in low-budget \\"B\\" movies, but it also gave him more than 10 years of job security. Vallin worked steadily in many of Katzman's features and serials, playing a variety of character roles: streetwise reporters, sinister villains, heroic internationals, and savage natives. His voice was also heard as the narrator of coming-attractions trailers. Occasionally he showed up in such television series as Brave Eagle, Sheriff of Cochise, Bat Masterson, Jefferson Drum, The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok, The Lone Ranger and Wyatt Earp. He was also cast on The Adventures of Superman, as well in both The Gene Autry Show and The Roy Rogers Show. His last appearance was a guest role on Daniel Boone in 1966.  Death  Vallin died in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 57. He is interred at Eden Memorial Park in Mission Hills, California.

He is an executive vice president of All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he is signed as a performer, and is a former AEW World Tag Team Champion. He also performs for Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide, where he is the current AAA Mega Champion in his first reign. Omega is best known for his tenure in New Japan Pro-Wrestling, during which he held the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, the IWGP United States Championship, and the IWGP Intercontinental Championship among other titles. Also known for his video games-inspired persona, he was a member of the Bullet Club stable, later serving as the group's leader. He became the first and only non-Japanese professional wrestler to win the G1 Climax, the promotion's premier tournament, when he defeated Hirooki Goto in the 2016 finals. Throughout his career, Omega has also performed as part of larger national and international promotions, such as Ring of Honor, as well as independent promotions worldwide, including DDT Pro-Wrestling, Jersey All Pro Wrestling, and Pro Wrestling Guerrilla. Hailed as one of the best professional wrestlers in the world, Omega was named Sports Illustrateds Wrestler of the Year in 2017, and topped Pro Wrestling Illustrateds list of top 500 male wrestlers the following year. He has also attained the latter publication's Match of the Year distinction twice; one of those matches, in which Omega competed against Kazuchika Okada in a two out of three falls match at Dominion 6.9 in Osaka-jo Hall in June 2018, received a seven-star rating from combat sports journalist Dave Meltzer, the highest rating Meltzer has ever awarded a professional wrestling match. Early life Tyson Smith was born in Transcona, Winnipeg, Manitoba on October 16, 1983. As of 2016, Smith's mother works in family services while his father works for the Canadian government as a transport officer. Smith's affinity toward professional wrestling began during childhood when he watched tapes of WWE (then-WWF)'s Saturday Night's Main Event, which became his favorite program. Growing up, Smith played ice hockey as a goalie. He also worked at branches of retailers IGA and Costco. Smith first became interested in a career in professional wrestling after one of his friends from Transcona Collegiate Institute (TCI) began training with Top Rope Championship Wrestling (TRCW) in Winnipeg. Smith ended his ice hockey career plans and began training under TRCW promoter Bobby Jay, whom he met while he was stacking shelves at an IGA store. After training with Jay for a year, 16-year- old Smith made his professional wrestling debut in the year 2000. He went on to wrestle as part of TRCW for two years, where he developed the gimmick of a Hawaiian surfer named Kenny Omega. The surfer aspect was later dropped and replaced with an otaku-influenced gimmick. In 2001, he graduated from TCI and enrolled in university, but dropped out during his first year in order to fully pursue professional wrestling. Professional wrestling career Early career and WWE (2001‚Äì2006) In 2001, Omega debuted in the Winnipeg- based promotion Premier Championship Wrestling (PCW). He won the PCW Heavyweight Championship and the PCW Tag Team Championship in 2003 and 2004, respectively, and regained the former for a second time in 2004. He unsuccessfully challenged Petey Williams for the TNA X Division Championship at the National Wrestling Alliance's 56th Anniversary Show on October 17. Omega lost to Tommy Knoxville at Millennium Wrestling Federation's March 2005 ULTRA event. He later won an eight-man tournament, defeating Nate Hardy, Chris Sabin, and Amazing Red, to win the Premier Cup and the NWA Canada X-Division Championship on June 2. Omega lost the title to Rawskillz on September 15. Nine days later, Omega made an appearance for Harley Race's World League Wrestling promotion in Eldon, Missouri, losing to Keith Walker in a match. After the match, he was invited to a week-long tryout by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). In October 2005, Smith was sent to Deep South Wrestling (DSW), WWE's then-developmental territory for a tryout, after which he was offered a developmental contract and subsequently assigned to DSW full-time. In August 2006, he requested his release from his contract. Omega later stated that his time in DSW was poor, particularly criticizing promoters Bill DeMott and Jody Hamilton, and trainer Bob Holly. Nevertheless, he expressed praise for trainer Dave Taylor. WWE has since reportedly approached him with contracts in the spring of 2014, three times in 2015, and in early 2019. Return to the independent circuit (2006‚Äì2019) After his release from WWE, Omega intended to forge a career in mixed martial arts and entered a few Brazilian jiu-jitsu tournaments before deciding to return to professional wrestling. Omega then reinvented his wrestling persona and developed a new distinct move set. Omega made his return to PCW on September 14, 2006, defeating Rawskillz to earn a match with A.J. Styles, whom he also defeated in the main event the following week. In June 2007, he defeated Petey Williams in the finals of the Premier Cup to win the tournament for the second time. In 2008, Omega regained the PCW Heavyweight Championship for the third and fourth times. He later went on to regain the PCW Tag Team Championship two more times. In 2011, Omega wrestled in tapings for Wrestling Revolution Project, performing under the ring name Scott Carpenter. In September 2018, he appeared at independent event All In, where he defeated Penta El Zero. Omega made appearances during PCW events in October 2018 and March 2019. Jersey All Pro Wrestling (2007‚Äì2012) JAPW Heavyweight Champion in November 2008 Omega competed for Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) on September 8, 2007, where he was defeated by Danny Demanto. On March 8, 2008, Omega captured the JAPW Heavyweight Championship by defeating Low Ki in Jersey City, New Jersey. On April 19, Omega retained his title against Frankie Kazarian at Spring Massacre. On July 10, he successfully defended his title against Jon Cutler in his hometown of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Omega lost the JAPW Heavyweight Championship to Jay Lethal at Jersey City Rumble on February 28, 2009, ending his reign at 357 days. Omega's next JAPW appearance took place on December 10, 2010, in a six-way elimination match for the JAPW Light Heavyweight Championship, during which he was eliminated by the eventual winner, Jushin Thunder Liger. On May 15, 2011, Omega defeated Liger in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania during New Japan Pro-Wrestling's inaugural United States tour to win the JAPW Light Heavyweight Championship. In a July 2013 interview, Omega said that although JAPW had not held a show since April 2012, he would be interested in returning to the company, citing how he still held the JAPW Light Heavyweight Championship. JAPW declared the Light Heavyweight Championship vacant on September 12, 2014. Ring of Honor (2008‚Äì2018) On July 25, 2008, Omega made his Ring of Honor (ROH) debut, losing to Delirious in Toronto, Ontario. The following night, Omega competed at ROH New Horizons, losing to Silas Young. After a losing streak, he gained his first victories by gaining two pinfalls over Austin Aries, who held the ROH World Championship, in December. On November 14, 2009, Omega competed against Aries for the title but was defeated. At Final Battle 2009, he competed in a Four-Corner Survival match, which was won by Claudio Castagnoli. In February 2016, Omega had signed on to become a regular competitor for ROH. He appeared for the promotion for the first time in nearly six years during its 14th Anniversary Show. Towards the end of the year, despite having the opportunity to return to ROH, Omega was asked by New Japan Pro-Wrestling not to take any outside bookings heading into Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome. Due to this, Omega did not appear for ROH for the rest of 2016. He returned to ROH in February 2017 during the first night of Honor Rising: Japan 2017, which was co-produced by the promotion and New Japan-Pro Wrestling, winning a tag team match against the Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark Briscoe) alongside Adam Cole. He also performed as part of the Global Wars 2017 tour, also co-produced by New Japan Pro-Wrestling. Omega returned to the promotion again for the Supercard of Honor XII event on April 7, 2018, where he lost to Cody. DDT Pro-Wrestling (2008‚Äì2014) In 2006, Omega became captivated by Japanese wrestler Kota Ibushi after watching him perform as part of Japanese promotion DDT Pro-Wrestling, so he uploaded videos of himself having a DDT-style match to YouTube, in hopes they would interest Ibushi into working with him. After seeing the videos, DDT invited Omega to Japan to wrestle Ibushi, which Omega accepted; he made his first appearance for the promotion in August 2008. Omega stated that wrestling in Japan had been one of his dreams, as the local scene appealed to his creative side, feeling that he was able to show his personality and express himself. He and Ibushi then formed a tag team named the Golden‚òÜLovers. In 2011, Omega competed in a match against a nine-year-old girl named Haruka. A video of the match went viral, making international news and receiving polarizing responses, after which Omega received death threats. Professional wrestler Mick Foley, conversely, praised Omega's work as a heel, asking why he was not on national television. Omega later stated that he was asked to work with Haruka due to the safe nature of his work and that he personally trained her before their match. In the same year, Omega represented DDT in All Japan Pro Wrestling's 2011 Junior League, making his debut for the promotion on September 11. After three wins and two losses, he finished second in his block and did not advance to the finals. On October 23, Omega defeated Kai to become the new World Junior Heavyweight Champion. He lost the title back to Kai on May 27, 2012, in his sixth title defense, ending his reign at 217 days. On December 23, Omega defeated El Generico to win the KO-D Openweight Championship for the first time. On January 27, 2013, Omega defeated Isami Kodaka in a title vs. title match and became a double champion by retaining his title and winning the DDT Extreme Division Championship held by Kodaka. He lost the KO-D Openweight Championship to Shigehiro Irie on March 20, 2013. On May 26, Omega once again became a double champion when he, Ibushi, and Gota Ihashi defeated Yuji Hino, Antonio Honda, and Daisuke Sasaki for the KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Championship. After a reign of 28 days, Omega's team lost the championship to Hino, Honda, and Hoshitango on June 23. On August 25, Omega lost the DDT Extreme Division Championship to Danshoku Dino. On January 26, 2014, the Golden‚òÜLovers defeated the respective teams of Kodaka and Yuko Miyamoto as well as Konosuke Takeshita and Tetsuya Endo in a three-way match to win the KO-D Tag Team Championship. On April 12, the Golden‚òÜLovers became double tag team champions when they teamed with Sasaki to defeat Irie, Keisuke Ishii, and Soma Takao for the KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Championship. Their reign lasted 22 days, as they lost the title to Kudo, Masa Takanashi, and Yukio Sakaguchi on May 4. On September 28, the Golden‚òÜLovers lost the KO-D Tag Team Championship to Takeshita and Endo. On October 26, he wrestled his final DDT match, where he and Ibushi defeated Dino and Takeshita. Omega returned to DDT for the promotion's Ultimate Party event on November 3, 2019, during which he and Riho scored a victory over Honda and Miyu Yamashita in a tag team match. Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (2008‚Äì2014) Battle of Los Angeles in 2008 On November 1, 2008, Omega appeared for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) during the 2008 Battle of Los Angeles, where he was defeated in the first round of the tournament by local talent Brandon Bonham. The next night, during a three-way tag team match in which Omega competed, he was Irish whipped into the ropes by Davey Richards, only for the force to snap the middle and bottom ropes, throwing Omega out of the ring. Three months later, Omega returned to the promotion at Express Written Consent, where he was defeated by El Generico after senior referee Rick Knox hit him with a leaping clothesline after Knox grew tired tired of Omega abusing him. At PWG's hundredth show on April 12, 2009, he lost to Bryan Danielson. On November 20, 2009, Omega entered the year's Battle of Los Angeles, which was contested for the vacant PWG World Championship, defeating Kevin Steen, Scott Lost, and Joey Ryan in the first, quarter, and semifinal rounds, respectively. He defeated Roderick Strong in the final round to win the tournament and become the PWG World Champion. On February 27, 2010, Omega lost the championship to Richards at As the Worm Turns in his first defense. On October 27, 2012, Omega made his first appearance for PWG in over two and a half years at Failure to Communicate when he teamed with El Generico in a tag team match, where they defeated the Young Bucks. Omega returned to PWG to compete in the 2014 Battle of Los Angeles on August 29, advancing all the way to the semifinals until he was eliminated by the eventual winner of the tournament, Ricochet. He returned again for the 2017 Battle of Los Angeles on September 2, teaming with the Young Bucks and defeating Flamita, Penta 0M, and Rey Fenix in a six-man tag team match. New Japan Pro-Wrestling =Sporadic appearances (2010‚Äì2014)= Omega competed for New Japan Pro- Wrestling (NJPW) in the 2010 Best of the Super Juniors tournament. In September, he lost to Prince Devitt in a match for Devitt's IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship.

On June 9, Omega was defeated in his semifinal match by Devitt, following interference from Devitt's Bullet Club stable. A year later, he took part in New Japan's 2014 Best of the Super Juniors tournament from May 30 to June 6, finishing with a record of three wins and four losses, with a loss against Taichi on the final day, which cost him a spot in the semifinals. =Bullet Club and the Elite (2014‚Äì2017)= Omega (far right) as a member of Bullet Club in 2015 On October 3, 2014, NJPW held a press conference to announce that Omega was set to sign with the promotion once his DDT contract expired on October 26. Omega, dubbing himself the Cleaner, made his debut under contract on November 8 at Power Struggle, where he was revealed as the newest member of Bullet Club, despite having previously dismissed the idea of joining the villainous foreigner stable, claiming that he did not consider himself a gaijin. Omega defeated Ryusuke Taguchi to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship for the first time at Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome on January 4, 2015. He retained the title over Taguchi in a rematch on February 11 at The New Beginning in Osaka. In the following months, he successfully defended the championship against M√°scara Dorada at Invasion Attack 2015 and Alex Shelley at Wrestling Dontaku 2015. Omega lost the title to Kushida on July 5 at Dominion 7.5 in Osaka-jo Hall.

On February 14 at The New Beginning in Niigata, Omega defeated Hiroshi Tanahashi to win the vacant IWGP Intercontinental Championship. Six days later at Honor Rising: Japan 2016, Omega became a double champion when he and the Young Bucks‚Äìthe Bullet Club subgroup known as the Elite‚Äìdefeated the Briscoe Brothers and Toru Yano for the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to Hiroshi Tanahashi, Michael Elgin, and Yoshitatsu on April 10 at Invasion Attack 2016.

On May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2016, the Elite regained the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship.

He lost to IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada in the main event of Wrestle Kingdom 11 on January 4, 2017. At 46 minutes and 45 seconds, the match was the longest in the history of the January 4 Tokyo Dome Show. Wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer gave the match a six-star rating in the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, adding that Omega and Okada \\"may have put on the greatest match in pro wrestling history\\". The match was also praised by fellow professional wrestlers Daniel Bryan, Mick Foley, and Stone Cold Steve Austin. On January 6, 2017, Omega stated that he would be \\"stepping away from Japan to reassess [his] future\\", adding that he was \\"weighing all options\\". On January 26, Omega appeared on Wrestling Observer Radio, announcing that he would be flying back to Japan in mid-February to negotiate a new deal with NJPW for \\"at least one more year\\". He returned during the Honor Rising: Japan 2017 events, which were co-produced by ROH, in February.

At Wrestle Kingdom 12 on January 4, 2018, Omega defeated Chris Jericho in a no disqualification match to retain the IWGP United States Championship. On January 28, he lost the title to Jay White at The New Beginning in Sapporo. After the match, Bullet Club member Adam Page confronted White but was stopped by Omega, who accepted defeat, which brought out Cody. After months of tension, Omega and Cody faced off, resulting in Cody hitting Omega with his finishing move. When Page attempted to assist Cody to further attack Omega, Kota Ibushi returned to the ring after having competed earlier in the night to save his former partner, leading to an embrace between Omega and Ibushi. On June 9, Omega defeated Okada in a two out of three falls match with no time limit for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at Dominion 6.9 in Osaka-jo Hall, becoming the first Canadian wrestler to win the title in the process. The match received a seven-star rating from Meltzer, which remains the highest rating ever given to a match. Omega then defeated Cody at NJPW's G1 Special in San Francisco on July 7, retaining his title as well as reaffirming his leadership of Bullet Club. However, during Omega's post-match celebration with the Young Bucks, they were attacked by Bullet Club members Tama Tonga, Tanga Loa, and King Haku, who targeted Omega, the Young Bucks, Cody, and every other member of the stable who tried to make the save. Omega then successfully defended his title against Ishii at Destruction as well as against Cody and Ibushi in a three-way match at King of Pro-Wrestling. It was revealed in October 2018 that Cody, Page, and Marty Scurll would be known alongside Omega and the Young Bucks as part of the Elite, with the group also stating that they were \\"no longer affiliated with Bullet Club\\". Omega lost the IWGP Heavyweight Championship to Hiroshi Tanahashi at Wrestle Kingdom 13 on January 4, 2019, ending his reign at 209 days. He departed NJPW after his contract expired at the end of January. All Elite Wrestling (2019‚Äìpresent) Omega signed a four-year contract with All Elite Wrestling (AEW) on February 7, 2019. Along with Cody and Matt and Nick Jackson, Omega serves as an executive vice president of the promotion as well as one of its in-ring talents. He competed at the promotion's inaugural event, Double or Nothing, where he lost to Chris Jericho in the main event, after which both men were attacked by Jon Moxley. The following month at Fyter Fest, Omega attacked Moxley in retaliation for Moxley's previous assault. A match between Omega and Moxley was scheduled for the All Out pay-per-view, however, Moxley pulled out of the match due to a MRSA infection. Omega instead competed against Pac at the event, where he was defeated. On the premiere episode of Dynamite on October 2, Omega was taken out by a returning Moxley during a six- man tag team match, with Omega's team later losing the contest. In the main event of Full Gear on November 9, Omega was defeated by Moxley in an unsanctioned Lights Out match. At Chris Jericho's Rock 'N' Wrestling Rager at Sea Part Deux: Second Wave, which aired on the January 22, 2020 episode of Dynamite, Omega and Adam Page defeated SoCal Uncensored (Frankie Kazarian and Scorpio Sky) to win the AEW World Tag Team Championship, marking the first title change in the promotion's history. At Revolution on February 29, Omega and Page retained the championship against the Young Bucks. The following month, it was announced that the Elite was set to face the Inner Circle‚Äìwhich comprises Jericho, Sammy Guevara, Jake Hager, and Santana and Ortiz‚Äìat Blood and Guts. After the event was indefinitely postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Omega, Page, and the Young Bucks instead competed alongside Matt Hardy against the Inner Circle in a Stadium Stampede match on May 23 at Double or Nothing, where Omega's team was victorious. On September 5 at All Out, Omega and Page lost the AEW World Tag Team Championship to FTR (Cash Wheeler and Dax Harwood). Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (2019‚Äìpresent) On August 3, 2019, Omega made his debut for Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide as part of the promotion's partnership with AEW at its Tripleman√≠a XXVII event, teaming with Matt and Nick Jackson in a losing effort against F√©nix, Pentag√≥n Jr., and Laredo Kid, after which Omega challenged F√©nix for his AAA Mega Championship. At H√©roes Inmortales XIII, Omega defeated F√©nix to win the title. Omega successfully defended the title against Jack Evans on the November 26 episode of Dark. On December 1, Omega competed against Dragon Lee in his second title defense at Tripleman√≠a Regia, where he was victorious. Omega defeated Sammy Guevara to retain the championship on the March 25 episode of Dynamite. Professional wrestling style and persona Omega performing the Hadouken attack from the Street Fighter games A fan of video games, Smith incorporates ideas from the medium into wrestling maneuvers, entrance music, and gimmick concepts. The Kenny Omega ring name was originally inspired by the character Omega Weapon from the Final Fantasy video game series; other examples include him naming one of his finishing maneuvers the One-Winged Angel, a reference to Final Fantasy VII's Sephiroth, making use of variations of Mega Man antagonist Dr. Wily's theme music as entrance themes, and utilizing the Hadouken attack from the Street Fighter series as a signature move. For his final appearance for NJPW at Wrestle Kingdom 13, Smith collaborated with Undertale creator Toby Fox to create a custom entrance video in the style of the game, scored to a remix of the final boss theme \\"Hopes and Dreams\\". In addition to video games, Smith also draws inspiration from the television show Star Trek: The Next Generation and superhero cartoons to develop elements of his in-ring persona. Smith also donned ring gear inspired by the character Akuma from the Street Fighter series at Fyter Fest in June 2019. During his run under a villainous persona, Smith, who is fluent in Japanese, stopped talking in Japanese and instead did his interviews in English. In reality, he was told that his otaku gimmick was \\"too bubbly\\" for Bullet Club, which led to him adopting the Cleaner nickname, which was intended to be a reference to people who clean up crime scenes. His look as the Cleaner was inspired by Albert Wesker from the Resident Evil video game series as well as Sylvester Stallone's character Marion \\"Cobra\\" Cobretti from the film Cobra. Although Smith originally intended to embody the gimmick straightforwardly, he later integrated comedy into the persona as a response to people who thought he was portraying a janitor, doing so by coming out for his matches holding a mop and a broom. Personal life Smith considers himself straight edge, as he abstains from alcohol, tobacco, and drug consumption. He has a younger sister. As of August 2018, Smith resides in the Katsushika ward in the east end of Tokyo and is fluent in Japanese. Smith told ESPN.com in October 2016 that he \\"loved Japanese culture before even realizing it was, in fact, Japanese culture\\" and that his favorite video games and cartoons were Japanese. He has since obtained Japanese citizenship. Regarding his life outside of wrestling, Smith said in 2016 that he had no time to think about relationships because he was completely focused on his wrestling goals. He is close friends with fellow professional wrestler and former tag team partner Michael Nakazawa. A self- professed avid gamer, Smith previously hosted a YouTube series called Cleaner's Corner, which documented himself playing some of his favorite video games. He also attends video game conventions during his spare time. On June 26, 2016, he made a special guest appearance at Community Effort Orlando, defeating WWE wrestler Xavier Woods in a match of Street Fighter V. Smith portrayed the character Cody Travers in a live-action portion in a trailer for Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition in 2018.

The company offers a cloud-based platform that helps large enterprises and SMBs transition from traditionally slow and costly forms of payments such as cash and cheques to real-time digital payments. It digitizes their entire procurement-to-payment cycle, thereby improving an overall efficiency and saving over 50% in time, efforts, resources and costs.  Service  The platform provides a comprehensive digital workflow tied to payments which enable greater control and transparency, along with better cash flows and end to end reconciliation for corporates in closed loop supply chains. The platform replaces traditional cash, cheque, EFT payments to card- based payments for corporates, facilitating suppliers to be paid out, irrespective of them being a card acquiring merchant. The system has several built-in risk mitigating benefits for buyers and sellers. It also features a complete procure-to-pay solution, invoice marketplace for dynamic discounting along with APIs for integration into existing accounting back-end for minimal friction-based deployment.  History  The company was launched in May 2006 as India's first mobile payments provider that allowed consumers to use their mobile phones to pay for online and retail purchases, make utility bill payments, purchase tickets, etc. via their bank account, credit card or a prepaid account. The PayPOS application, that allowed small businesses to accept credit and debit cards and process electronic transactions directly on their mobile phones at the point of sale devices (POS), was also launched, shaping up the company's B2C offerings and disrupting the Indian payment landscape. A person-to-person (P2P) mobile money transfer facility was also offered in association with Tata Indicom and Corporation Bank launched Green Money Transfer. In 2013, PayMate began focusing on B2B payments that automated payables and receivables, and was processing in excess of $500M in annualized payment processing run rate. In due course, this business payments platform evolved, making the company a strategic B2B partner for Visa in 2018. This partnership flourished and led to PayMate's expansion into CEMEA region to offer its business payments platform. As there was no more requirement of the wallet license, in February 2017, the company gave up its RBI issued prepaid wallet license, discontinuing all its B2C payments activity and focus only on B2B payments opportunities across geographies.  Acquisition  PayMate acquired the lending solution Zaitech Technologies Pvt. Ltd in 2018, which when combined with its proprietary B2B payments platform will revolutionize the way businesses manage their payment operations, cashflow, and get access to growth capital.

Scotland won by 1 goal & 1 try to 1 try Rugby union in Scotland in its modern form has existed since the mid-19th century. As with the history of rugby union itself however, it emerged from older traditional forms of football which preceded the codification of the sport. In the same manner as rugby union in England, rugby union in Scotland would grow at a significant rate to the point where Scotland played England in the first ever rugby union international in 1871, a match which was won by the Scottish team. In 1883, Scotland would become a founding member of the annual Home Nations Championship with England, Wales and Ireland, (now the Six Nations Championship with the inclusion of France and Italy), and since its creation in 1987 have competed in every Rugby World Cup. Scotland took part in co-hosting the 1991 Rugby World Cup, alongside the rest of the United Kingdom, Ireland and France. The governing body of rugby union in Scotland, Scottish Rugby Union, is the second oldest organisation of its kind, having been founded in 1873. Early history Earliest rugby games Until the mid-nineteenth century the distinction between rugby football and association football (soccer) did not exist in Scotland so both codes share the same history. There is a long tradition of \\"football\\" games in Scotland, and many of these such as Jeddart Ba' bear more resemblance to rugby than association football, since passing and carrying by hand play a large part in them. The Kirkwall Ba game still takes place, and involves scrummaging. Scottish soccer enthusiasts also cite these games as ancestral to their sport. Unregulated School rugby Several new schools were formed in Scotland during the first half of the 19th century, among them The Edinburgh Academy (1824), Loretto (1827), Merchiston (1833), Glasgow Academy (1845) and Trinity College, Glenalmond (1847). It is known that unregulated forms of football were played at all of these schools, but it was in Edinburgh that the handling game first took root and spread to other areas of the country. Codified rugby comes to Scotland Edinburgh Academy and the Crombies Two young men, Francis Crombie and Alexander Crombie, came from Durham School to Edinburgh in 1854. Francis joined The Academy as a pupil but Alexander had already left school. Apparently, the boys brought the knowledge of football from Durham School and this they passed on. Francis is recorded as having been the first school football captain and Alexander became actively involved in the formation of The Edinburgh Academical Football Club. He qualified for membership under a rule which allowed relatives of school pupils to become members. In 1858 he became the first captain of the Football Club - a position he held for eight years. The High School in Edinburgh and Hamilton During the same period, a boy named Hamilton came to The High School in Edinburgh (in 1856) from an English public school and brought with him the 'Rules of Rugby Football' as he had known them in the south. This document was instrumental in the High School's adapting their existing game to this new form. First ever Schools match The first-ever inter-school match recorded in Scotland was Royal High School versus Merchiston (in Edinburgh), played on 13 February 1858. However, the game suffered from lack of uniformity of rule and ball. Standardisation of rules In The High School, in the early 1860s, football was played with '...monstrous inflated globes of vast circumference and ponderosity...'. H. H. Almond, a master at both Loretto and Merchiston, and a founding father of the game in Scotland, describing an incident in a Loretto versus Merchiston match, wrote: '...but so little did any of us, masters or boys, then know about it, that I remember how, when Lyall ran with the ball behind the Merchiston goal the resulting try was appealed against on the ground that no player may cross the line whilst holding the ball. The previous rule at Merchiston had been that he must let go of the ball and kick it over before he touched it down. It must be said in excuse for this and other similar sins of ignorance, that the only available rules were those printed for the use of Rugby School. They were very incomplete and presupposed a practical knowledge of the game.' =Disputes= Gradually, over several years, the game approached that then being played at Rugby. There were local variations which, inevitably, resulted in disputes. H.H. Almond: 'well into the 1870s the only schools able to play each other on even terms were The Edinburgh Academy, Merchiston and The High School.' From the mid-1860s, senior (former pupils) clubs started to appear in both the Edinburgh and Glasgow areas and these clubs, making good use of the then new railways, began to play each other. In those early club matches play was often halted whilst captains and umpires tried to settle some point of difference. Such disputes and mix-ups were frequent. Such a state of affairs could not continue indefinitely and a group of men from The Edinburgh Academical Football Club convened a series of meetings and, in 1868, with the agreement of the other schools and clubs, set out and had printed rules for the game in Scotland. =The Green Book= The resulting booklet Laws of Football as played by the Principal Clubs in Scotland, became known as The Green Book. Alas, no copy survives but it is worthy of note that neither the clubs nor The Green Book felt it necessary to include the word 'Rugby' in their title. Indeed, the Scottish Football Union, formed in 1873, did not alter its name to become the Scottish Rugby Union until 1924 - the year prior to the opening of Murrayfield. Oldest continual fixture The world's oldest continual rugby fixture was first played in 1858 between Merchiston Castle School and the former pupils of The Edinburgh Academy, although the 'Edinburgh Courant' journal of Jan 1858 describes a Rugby Football match of December 1857 between sides representing 'The University' (Edinburgh) and 'The Academical Club' (Edinburgh Academicals FC). 1871-1924 The first ever international Scene of the first international, Scotland v England, 28 March 1871 The first international rugby football game resulted from a challenge issued in the sporting weekly Bell's Weekly on 8 December 1870 and signed by the captains of five Scottish clubs, inviting any team \\"selected from the whole of England\\" to a 20-a-side game to be played under the Rugby rules. The game was played at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, the home ground of Edinburgh Academicals, on 27 March 1871. The English team wore white with a red rose and the Scots brownGlasgow Herald (Glasgow, Scotland), Tuesday, 28 March 1871; Issue 9746 with a thistle. This is not only the first international rugby match but the first international of any form of football because, despite the fact that three England v Scotland fixtures had already been played according to Association Football rules at The Oval, London, in 1870 and 1871 these are not considered full internationals by FIFA as the players competing in the Scotland team were London-based players who claimed a Scottish family connection rather than being truly Scottish players. The team representing England was captained by Frederick Stokes of Blackheath, that representing Scotland was led by Francis Moncrieff; the umpire was Hely Hutchinson Almond, headmaster of Loretto College. England played in all white, with a red rose on their shirts; Scotland wore brown shirts and white cricket flannels. The game, played over two-halves, each of 50 minutes, was won by Scotland, who scored a goal (a try followed by a successful conversion kick). Both sides also scored a try, but these did not count as the conversion kicks were missed. Angus Buchanan scored the try (the first in international rugby), and William Cross converted it. In a return match at the Kennington Oval, London, in 1872, England were the winners. In December 1870, following a series of England v. Scotland eleven-a-side football matches played in London (all of which were won by England), a group of Scots players issued a letter of challenge in The Scotsman and in Bell's Life in London, to play an England XX at the carrying game. The first ever international rugby union game was played on the cricket field of The Edinburgh Academy at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh on 27 March 1871 between England and Scotland. The Scots won the encounter by a goal and a try to a solitary try scored by England, though England got revenge at the Kennington Oval, London in the following year. (See the library of the Scottish Rugby Union for details.) The newspaper notice advertising the very first rugby international match - inconspicuous by being slotted in between other items (From The Scotsman, 27.3.1871) In December 1870, following a series of England v. Scotland eleven-a-side football matches played in London (all of which were won by England), a group of Scots players issued a letter of challenge in The Scotsman and in Bell's Life in London, to play an England XX at the carrying game. The English could hardly ignore such a challenge and this led to the first-ever rugby international match being played at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, on Monday 27 March 1871. The Scots won the encounter by a goal and a try to a solitary try scored by England (a points scoring system had not then been devised). Scotland was responsible for organising the very first rugby international when a side representing England met the Scottish national side on the cricket field of the Edinburgh Academy at their Raeburn Place ground on 27 March 1871; Scotland won by one goal. First Provincial match The first provincial rugby football match in the world was played on 23 November 1872 in Scotland. This was between Glasgow District and Edinburgh District and played at the Burnbank ground in Woodlands, Glasgow. Edinburgh won the match 3‚Äì0 in a 20 a side fixture. This match became known as the 'Inter-City'. The Glasgow - Edinburgh match is still played today between the now professional provincial sides. Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby compete for the 1872 Cup in recognition of the first Inter-City fixture. Origins of the SRU The \\"Scottish Football Union\\" (SFU) was founded in 1873. The Calcutta Cup Calcutta Cup match, Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, 1890 The Calcutta Cup was gifted to the Rugby Football Union in 1878 by the members of the short-lived Calcutta Rugby Club. The members had decided to disband: the cup was crafted from melted-down silver rupees which became available when the Club's funds were withdrawn from the bank. The Cup is unique in that it is competed for annually only by England and Scotland. The first Calcutta Cup match was played in 1879 and, since that time, over 100 matches have taken place. Scotland have won the Calcutta Cup 39 times. They compete in Six Nations Championship and have never won it, however they did win the last 5 nations championship in 1999 only narrowly missing out on a grand slam. Scotland have participated in every Rugby World Cup tournament. International Rugby Board left The SFU was a founder member of the International Rugby Board in 1886, along with Ireland and Wales. > Left: The minutes of the first formal meeting of the IRFB, from a meeting > attended by Lyle and McAlistair of Ireland, Carrick and Gardner of Scotland, > Mullock and Lyne of Wales. England belatedly joined the Board in 1890. Australia, New Zealand and South Africa became full members in 1949. France became a member in 1978 and a further eighty members joined from 1987 to 1999. The International Rugby Board is now known as World Rugby and oversees the administration of the sport. World Rugby organises the Rugby World Cups. Late 19th and early 20th Centuries The Scotland team of 1896. In 1897 land was purchased, by the SFU, at Inverleith, Edinburgh. Thus the SFU became the first of the Home Unions to own its own ground. The first visitors were Ireland, on 18 February 1899 (Scotland 3 Ireland 9). The Scots enjoyed periodic success in the early days vying with Wales in the first decade of the 20th century. However, their Triple Crown win in 1907 would be the last for eighteen years as the First World War (1914‚Äì18) and England intervened to deny them glory. In 1924 the SFU changed its name to become the Scottish Rugby Union. International rugby was played at Inverleith until 1925. The SRU bought some land and built the first Murrayfield Stadium which was opened on 21 March 1925. Invention of Rugby Sevens Nestling beneath the shadow of the Eildon Hills, the Greenyards at Melrose in Scotland is the original home of rugby sevens Scotland has played a seminal role in the development of rugby, notably in Rugby sevens, which were initially conceived by Ned Haig, a butcher from Jedburgh, Scotland as a fundraising event for his local club Melrose in 1883. The first ever officially sanctioned international tournament of rugby occurred at Murrayfield as part of the \\"Scottish Rugby Union's celebration of rugby\\" centenary celebrations in 1973. Due to the success of the format, the ongoing Hong Kong Sevens was launched three years later. In 1993, the Rugby World Cup Sevens was launched and the trophy is known as the Melrose Cup in memory of Ned Haig's invention. Union-League schism In 1895, there was a schism within the game of rugby in neighbouring England which saw the sport divided into rugby union which remained amateur and rugby league which permitted payments to players. However, no such split took place in Scotland where the clubs continued to play rugby union. Fourteen Scottish players would cross over and play rugby league in England before amateurism was abandoned. While rugby league is not as popular as rugby union in Scotland, it has maintained a continuous presence for over a century in the country, thanks partly to its proximity to Northern England which is the heartland of the game. 1925-1945 In 1925 Scotland already had victories over France at Inverleith (25-4), Wales in Swansea (24-14) and Ireland in Dublin (14-8). England, the Grand Slam champions of the two previous seasons were the first visitors to Murrayfield. 70,000 spectators saw the lead change hands three times before Scotland secured a 14‚Äì11 victory which gave them their first-ever Five Nations Grand Slam. In 1926, Scotland became the first Home nation side to defeat England at Twickenham after England had won the Grand Slam five times in eight seasons. The outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 brought rugby union in Scotland to a halt. The SRU cancelled all arranged trial and international matches and encouraged the member clubs to carry on as best they could. Some clubs closed down, others amalgamated and carried on playing other local clubs and, sometimes, teams from the armed forces stationed in their various areas. 1946-1973 Official internationals resumed in the 1946‚Äì7 season. In the Spring of 1946, Scotland played and defeated a strong New Zealand and Forces team. The period after World War II was not a successful one for Scotland. In 1951, the touring Springboks massacred Scotland 44-0 scoring nine tries, a then record defeat. Scotland suffered 17 successive defeats between February 1951 and February 1955, scored only 54 points in these 17 games: 11 tries, six conversions, and four penalties. The teams from 1955-63 were an improvement. There were no win over England, but three of the games were drawn and only twice was the margin of defeat more than a single. 1964 was a good year for Scotland New Zealand were held to a 0‚Äì0 draw, the last international match in which no points were scored. The Calcutta Cup was won 15‚Äì6, the first time since 1950 and they shared the Five Nations title in 1964 with Wales. In 1971 the SRU appointed Bill Dickinson as their head coach, after years of avoidance, as it was their belief that rugby should remain an amateur sport. He was officially designated as an \\"adviser to the captain\\". Scotland were the first of the Home Unions to run a truly nationwide club league. This was introduced in 1973 and still flourishes today with several of the country's original clubs still very much in evidence, such as Heriots, West of Scotland, Watsonians and the famous 'border' clubs such as Gala, Hawick, Jed-Forest, Kelso and Melrose. However the advent of professionalism saw Scotland's District championship abandoned and two (later three) 'Super Districts' formed, which have resulted in the top players generally being unavailable for their clubs. These teams play in international club competitions such as the Heineken Cup and the Celtic League. 1974-2000 Jim Telfer became national coach in 1980. Scotland toured Australia and won the first test, which to date is Scotland's only away victory against any of the big three Southern Hemisphere sides. After this, the 1983 season was a disappointment, with only one victory at Twickenham in the last match. The 1983‚Äì84 season brought a draw with the All Blacks 25‚Äì25 in the late autumn and their second Grand Slam captained by Jim Aitken. Jim Telfer stood down after the Grand Slam to concentrate on his professional career as a school master. He was succeeded by his assistant, the former Hawick fly-half, Colin Telfer. Scotland went to the first World Cup, played in New Zealand and Australia in the summer of 1987. Rutherford, the team's general and controlling influence, badly injured his knee on an unauthorised tour of Bermuda. He broke down after less than a quarter of an hour of the first World Cup match against France and never played for Scotland again. Scotland had been in the lead but the match finished level and Scotland had to face New Zealand in the quarter-final. They lost. Their greatest year in the modern era, however, was 1990 when, captained by prop David Sole, their season came down to one game, a Grand Slam decider at Murrayfield against the \\"auld enemy\\" and hot favourites, England. Sole famously walked his men onto the field with quiet but steely determination, to the delight of the partisan home crowd. Scotland won 13‚Äì7, and with it their third Grand Slam. The second World Cup took place in 1991 with matches shared between the Five Nations. Scotland won their pool, though the game against Ireland was close, and then beat Western Samoa in the quarter-final. They went out to England in the semi-final held at Murrayfield to a Rob Andrew drop goal. In the third place play-off they were again beaten by New Zealand. The third World Cup, held in South Africa, came around in 1995. The tournament followed a familiar pattern: a narrow defeat by France, thanks to an injury- time try, meant that, as second in the pool, they faced a quarter-final against New Zealand and were eliminated. Professionalisation The SRU redeveloped Murrayfield Stadium, which is the main home ground of the Scottish national team starting 1993. Rugby union became professional in 1995. When the Heineken Cup was suggested SRU officials were concerned that Scottish club sides could not compete against the best teams from France and England and that Scotland's District teams might do better if they became centrally funded. The SRU professionalised the traditional Districts of Glasgow District, Edinburgh District, South and North and Midlands as the respective provincial clubs Glasgow Warriors, Edinburgh Rugby, Border Reivers and Caledonia Reds. In 1996 these provincial professional clubs were given the go- ahead to take part in Europe. For the first two seasons, players were still released to play for their clubs in domestic competition, but eventually the districts became full-time operations. Many of the traditional rugby union supporters in Scotland have viewed professionalism as contributing to a loss of a golden age, with some supporters mourning local and amateur players being replaced by hired professionals.Kelly (2008) Flowers of Scotland: Rugby Union, National Identities and Class Distinction. Stadion: International Journal of the History of Sport, 34, 1: 83-99 Then financial difficulties ‚Äì the SRU's high debt, partly as a result of the redevelopment of Murrayfield and this initial lack of support from traditional club fans ‚Äì called for retrenchment. After two seasons, the SRU 'merged' the four teams into two. This resulted in short-lived name changes: Edinburgh merged with the Border Reivers to form a team to be known as Edinburgh Reivers; and Glasgow merged with Caledonia Reds to form a team to be known as Glasgow Caledonians. In effect, though, the Caledonia Reds and Border Reivers sides were selected by the SRU to be disbanded in 1998; and this despite the Reds winning the 1996‚Äì97 Scottish Inter-District Championship and the Border Reivers district being the traditional heartlands of Scottish rugby. With the establishment of the Celtic League tournament, the SRU felt confident enough to resurrect one of the disbanded districts. It chose the Border Reivers and in 2002 and they joined the second season of the Celtic League. The merged names of Edinburgh and Glasgow were then ditched, although Edinburgh briefly flirted with a 'Gunners' epitaph in 2006; and Glasgow formally adopted its warrior logo as an epitaph in 2005. In 2004 international rugby games were played at Hampden Park in Glasgow and McDiarmid Park in Perth, as part of the SRU's campaign to reach out to new audiences outside the traditional rugby areas. Unfortunately the Border side was still unsustainable and it folded again in 2007. Establishing four professional districts once again remains a long-term goal of the SRU and the now likelier candidate Caledonia Reds will be re-established when the SRU believe financial circumstances permit. Changes in the professional era In 1996, the 4 newly professional Districts continued as before, playing in the Scottish Inter-District Championship which became a European Qualifying Tournament. The top sides were entered into the Heineken Cup, the bottom side was entered in the European Challenge Cup. This meant that the Scottish Exiles side was excluded from the professional Inter-District Championship as it could not represent Scotland in European competition. In 1998, when the Caledonia Reds and Border Reivers folded, the SRU realised that Glasgow and Edinburgh needed more competition to become competitive. Overtures were made to the Welsh Rugby Union and a Welsh-Scottish League began in 1999. The success of the joint venture between the SRU and the WRU eventually brought the Irish Rugby Football Union on board and a Celtic League was set-up in 2001 with Scottish, Irish and Welsh sides. It ran in parallel with the Welsh- Scottish League for its first season, but fixture congestion prompted the ending of the Welsh-Scottish competition in favour of the expanded tournament. A brief cup competition, the Celtic Cup was also tried, but again this ended due to fixture congestion. The Celtic League was further extended with the introduction of Italian professional sides. This resulted in another name change and the professional league became known as the Pro12. After two South African teams joined in 2017, the competition was renamed the Pro14. Glasgow Warriors became the first Scottish side to win a professional trophy in season 2014‚Äì15. Into the 2000s The new millennium Lineout in England- Scotland game, 2007 Scotland also won the last-ever Five Nations Championship in 1999 with some dashing displays of 15-man rugby and to a last minute win by Wales over England, but that year's World Cup ended the usual way, with a quarter-final defeat by New Zealand. They endured a torrid Six Nations in 2000, losing their first four straight games including a humiliating 34‚Äì20 defeat to a debuting Italy. In their last game they managed a 19‚Äì13 win under captain Andy Nicol over an unbeaten England at a rain-soaked Murrayfield 2003 season & the future After a poor start in the Six Nations 2003‚Äì04 in which Scotland did not win a single match and so qualified for rugby's version of the wooden spoon, things were believed to be steadily improving once again under the Australian coach Matt Williams, the first foreigner to coach the national team. Despite setbacks, many new and talented young players are coming through to the top level. Yet the record for 2004 was disappointing: Played 12, Won 2, Lost 10. Williams also attempted to introduce a controversial \\"Fortress Scotland\\" policy, whereby only those currently playing in Scotland were eligible to play in the national team. Meanwhile, the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) is under new management, Chief Executive Phil Anderton (known as 'Firework Phil' for his pre-match entertainment spectacles) was leading the way back to financial solvency and implementing major reforms to reverse the decline of the game in Scotland, but he resigned in January 2005 after his boss David Mackay was forced to resign by the SRU's general committee. Since then, much effort and thought has gone into restructuring the way the game is governed in Scotland. =Under Frank Hadden= Frank Hadden, the head coach of Edinburgh Gunners (previously a PE teacher at Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh), was appointed interim coach for the 2005 summer internationals against the Barbarians and Romania, winning two from two and instilling confidence in the national side again. On 15 September 2005, he was appointed national coach of the Scotland team up to and including the 2007 World Cup. In the first match of the 2006 Six Nations campaign, against France, Scotland won 20‚Äì16, and this was the first time since 1999 that they had beaten France. Scotland also beat England 18‚Äì12 at home at Murrayfield on 25 February 2006 to reclaim the Calcutta Cup. 11 November 2006 Scotland 44-6 Romania In the 2006 Autumn internationals Scotland won two of three fixtures. They convincingly beat Romania and put up a solid first half performance against the Pacific Islanders. In the final match against Australia, Scotland failed to impress. A sound first half performance was squandered with an uncharacteristically poor defence in the second. Australia went on to win the game 44‚Äì15. The series provided a mixture of advances and setbacks. Scotland lost several key players through injury, notably captain Jason White was suffered a knee injury and missed the entire 2007 Six Nations Championship. Scotland suffered a humiliating defeat on 24 February 2007 when they became the first Six Nations team to lose at home to Italy, 17‚Äì37. This was Italy's biggest ever victory over Scotland, home or away. After only six minutes of the match Scotland were already trailing 0-21, due to a clearance kick being charged down and two interceptions by the Italians. Man of the match was awarded to Italian Alessandro Troncon, who scored a late try to put the match out of reach. In 2007, The Borders was disbanded yet again due to continuing financial difficulties. Also in the same year, the SRU began organising the Edinburgh 7s, the final event in the annual IRB Sevens World Series. Scotland v Ireland 2007 Later that year, the side travelled to France for the rugby world cup. They fought their way through a difficult group and made it to the quarter finals where they were knocked out by Argentina. Despite the promising World Cup, Scotland did not emerge in the Six Nations as the dark horses the media had predicted. Scotland opened their campaign at home but lost 27‚Äì6 to France. Pressure on Frank Hadden started to intensify after round 2 as Scotland lost 30‚Äì15 to a rejuvenated Wales side who could have scored more. Scotland finally managed to score a try, against Ireland, despite losing. They didn't need to score a try against England however as they regained the Calcutta Cup with a 15‚Äì9 victory in a dull contest. Scotland scored two tries against Italy but lost thanks to a drop goal in the last minute to go down 23‚Äì20. Scotland managed to avoid the wooden spoon on scoring difference but it was a disappointing campaign. They then toured Argentina to play two tests against Argentina. They lost the first test 21-15 and won the second 26‚Äì14.

It is a culture in movement, a mixture of diversity and common traits, bringing together the most diverse beliefs and practices. Music Gabonese music is little-known in comparison with regional giants like the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroon. The country boasts an array of folk styles, as well as pop stars like Patience Dabany and Annie-Flore Batchiellilys, a Gabonese singer and renowned live performer.

Located in Glen Echo Park in Glen Echo, Maryland, it has been performing for children since 1951 and educating children in creative drama since 1978. adventuretheatre-mtc.org . History Adventure Theatre was founded in 1951 by a group of women from the Community Arts Association‚Äôs drama classes, who believed that children deserve to experience excellent theater. In 1955 Adventure Theatre began commissioning plays by award-winning, nationally-recognized children‚Äôs theater playwrights Flora Atkins and Helen Avery. Both are recipients of the prestigious Charlotte B. Chorpenning Award from The Children's Theatre Association of America. The In-School Players, a traveling troupe, was launched in 1969 as a result of a request by the Director of Language Arts for the District of Columbia Public Schools. The In- School Players remains a vital part of AT programming. Adventure Theatre moved into a new permanent space of its own in 1971 after years of touring, at Glen Echo Park, its current location. For 1974‚Äì79, Adventure Theatre expanded programming by partnering with the Junior League to create The Picture Book Players, a performance troupe for pre-school and early elementary-aged children. Adventure Theatre also began offering its first theater-education classes and created a puppet division, now The Puppet Co., another resident of Glen Echo Park. In 1986 New Plays Books published Six Adventure Theatre Plays, which were distributed to bookstores and children‚Äôs theaters around the country. The County Council of Montgomery County proclaimed June as ‚ÄúAdventure Theatre Month,‚Äù in honor of the theater‚Äôs 35 years of service. Renovation of the home space was completed in 2007. The extensive renovation, which includes a state-of-the-art theatre, new rehearsal spaces, and room for an expanded administrative staff, Adventure Theatre, enables the theater to expand its programming and offer services to thousands of additional patrons each year. Producing Artistic Director, Michael J. Bobbitt received the 2010 County Executive‚Äôs Awards for Excellence in the Arts ‚Äì Emerging Leader and became President of the League of Washington Theaters. Adventure Theatre partnered with Montgomery College to co-produce Harry Connick, Jr‚Äôs, The Happy Elf, directed by Tony Winner John Rando and starring Tony winner Michael Rupert. Additionally, Adventure Theatre adapted and produced the classic television special ‚Äì Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Adventure Theatre‚Äôs production of If you Give a Pig a Pancake, broke box-office records, received critical and public acclaim, and was featured in American Theatre Magazine. Both If you Give a Pig a Pancake and The Happy Elf received national recognition and helped solidify Adventure Theatre's position as a leader in arts and arts education for youth. Facility In September 2007, Adventure Theatre introduced renovations including a new stage and audience seating, a state-of- the-art sound and light system, new rehearsal and education spaces, and party rooms.

Old, M.D., c. 1995 Lloyd John Old (September 23, 1933 ‚Äì November 28, 2011) was one of the founders and standard-bearers of the field of cancer immunology. When Old began his career in 1958, tumor immunology was in its infancy. Today, cancer immunotherapies are emerging as a significant advance in cancer therapy.Dougan, M. & Dranoff, G. (2009). Immune therapy for cancer. Annual Review of Immunology 27, 83‚Äì117 Old's contributions to research established many of the principles and priorities of modern tumor immunology. In earlier work, he and his colleagues introduced Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) to tumor immunotherapy; discovered the first link between the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and disease (leukemia); found the unexpected association between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma; discovered Tumor necrosis factors (TNF); defined the concept of cell-surface differentiation antigens with the discovery of TL, Lyt (CD8), and a range of other mouse antigenic systems; discovered p53, independently with two other groups; and identified the tumor immunogenicity of heat shock proteins. Old is the author or co-author of more than 800 research publications. He was also a teacher helping young scientist as they began their career. He held the William E. Snee Chair of Cancer Immunology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), where he was director of the Ludwig Cancer Research New York Branch (then known as Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, or LICR). He was also a trustee of the LICR Charitable Trust, and a trustee of the Virginia & D.K. Ludwig Fund for Cancer Research.6. From 1971 to 2011, he served as the founding scientific and medical director of the Cancer Research Institute (CRI), where from 2001 to 2011 he also served as director of the CRI/LICR Cancer Vaccine Collaborative (CVC), an international network dedicated to testing and optimizing therapeutic cancer vaccines. Old's previous appointments included chairman of the LICR board of directors (2006‚Äì2009), LICR scientific director (1988 to 2005), member of the Emeritus LICR Scientific Committee (1971‚Äì86), LICR chief executive officer (1995‚Äì2004), and associate director of research at MSKCC (1973‚Äì83). Old served as a member of scientific advisory boards and committees including the Public Health Research Institute of the City of New York, the National Cancer Institute, and the American Association for Cancer Research. Old was also a member of the American Association for Cancer Research, New York Academy of Sciences, Reticuloendothelial Society, Society of Experimental Biology and Medicine, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Association of Immunologists, National Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Cancer Immunology, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He had also received honorary doctor of medicine degrees from Karolinska Institute, the University of Lausanne, and the University College London. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a B.A. in biology and earned a medical degree from the University of California, San Francisco. Old died November 28, 2011, in his New York City home, after several years battling advanced prostate cancer. Major discoveries *Introduced Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG), the tuberculosis vaccine, into experimental cancer research as a way to stimulate non-specific resistance to tumor growth. BCG was FDA-approved in 1991 and is now widely used as a first line treatment for superficial bladder cancer (1959).Old LJ, Clark DA, Benacerraf B. Effect of Bacillus Calmette Guerin infection on transplanted tumors in the mouse. Nature 1959; 184:291-292. *Discovered the first linkage between the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and disease‚Äîmouse leukemia‚Äîopening the way for the recognition of the importance of the MHC in the immune response (1964).Lilly F, Boyse EA, Old LJ. Genetic basis of susceptibility to viral leukaemogenesis. Lancet. 1964 Dec 5;2(7371): 1207-9. *Identified the first cell surface antigens distinguishing cells of different lineages, introducing the concept of cell surface antigens that could differentiate different cell types. First coined TL (for ‚Äúthymus- leukemia‚Äù antigen in mice) then later as the Ly series (originally named Ly-A and Ly-B and later called Ly-1, Ly-2, and Ly-3), this discovery led directly to the wide use of cell surface markers to distinguish and classify normal and malignant cells and the development of CD classification (for ‚Äúclusters of differentiation‚Äù). Most notably, Dr. Old discovered the LY-B antigen, later renamed CD8 in humans. CD8 cells, often referred to as ‚Äúkiller‚Äù T cells, are one of the major cells of the adaptive immune response, and are capable of directly killing dangerous or foreign cells (1964‚Äì1968).Old LJ, Boyse EA, Stockert E.

He was a pupil of the painter Jacob Adriaensz Backer in Amsterdam from 1645 to 1648. He worked for Charles II of England in his Dutch exile, and from 1660 until his death he lived and worked in The Hague. His portraits were popular in his day, and he painted the most distinguished people of his time. Biography Members of the magistrate of The Hague, 1682 Jan de Baen was born on 20 February 1633 in Haarlem, Holland, Dutch Republic. After his parents died, when he was a child, he lived with his uncle Hinderk Pyman (or Piemans) in Emden. Jan de Baen received his first painting lessons from his uncle, who was a painter himself. From 1645 to 1648 he lived in Amsterdam, where he was the pupil of painter Jacob Adriaensz Backer. After completing his training, he worked for the exiled court of Charles II of England, but upon the English Restoration of 1660 did not follow his patron, but moved to The Hague, where he worked as a portrait painter for the rest of his life. The Elector of Brandenburg asked him to work at his court in Berlin, but he refused this invitation. He was the teacher of his son, the painter Jacobus de Baen, and the pupils Johann Friedrich Bodecker, Denys Godijn, Hendrik van Limborch, Nicolaes van Ravesteyn, Petro van Rijs, Jan van Sweel, and Johannes Vollevens. He died in 1702 around his 69th birthday, and was buried in The Hague on 8 March 1702. In his biographical sketch of Jan de Baen, Houbraken claims that he taught his son Jacobus to paint, who died at 27.

He painted Cornelis de Witt and his brother Johan de Witt both alive and dead. He portrayed the Grandduke of Tuscany, and King-stadtholder William III of England. Besides portraits, he also painted cityscapes, history paintings, and genre paintings. The German Meyers Konversations-Lexikon (1885‚Äì1892) states that his large reputation during his life was not justified by his \\"characterless, rigid, and unattractively coloured images\\".

Its first release in 2009 was subtitled Ego Draconis, and was published by dtp entertainment and in the United States by cdv Software Entertainment. The updated 2011 re-release The Dragon Knight Saga which included the expansion Flames of Vengeance, as well as the final 2012 release as Divinity II: Developer's Cut, were published by Focus Home Interactive. The defining feature of Divinity II is the ability to switch between aerial combat as a dragon, and more traditional third-person action-role playing gameplay as a human. It is the third game in the Divinity franchise, and the first Divinity game to be released on consoles as well as for Microsoft Windows. Gameplay The main focus of the game is on traditional action-role playing gameplay, which includes completing quests, exploring the game world, and interacting with a variety of non-player characters. Divinity II utilizes some elements of games like Diablo, such as a focus on upgrading equipment, randomized magical effects on equipment, unique item sets that offer greater benefits when used together, and some quest mechanics such as markers to show that an NPC will offer a quest to the player. However, it also uses elements from more traditional computer role playing games, such as branching conversation trees, choices which affect other events in the game, and non-combat segments, such as platforming or puzzle elements. When interacting with non-player characters, the player will often have the option to read their minds, which can provide information, extra choices in a quest, or equipment, at a certain cost to their experience points. The 'experience debt' then has to be repaid before they can gain experience again. Players are given a choice of starting packages for their character during the tutorial, but progression is freeform, and the player is free to develop their character in a different direction if they want to. Skills are grouped into 'schools' which correspond to traditional roles, but all skills are available to all characters, allowing mixing between these roles. Multiple forms of crafting exist: alchemy, which allows the player to create potions; necromancy, which allows a player to customize a summonable undead pet; and enchanting, which upgrades the character's equipment. After a certain point in the game, the character gains a base of operations known as the Battle Tower, as well as the ability to become a dragon in large spaces. Dragon combat works similarly to ground-based combat, but in three dimensions; as a dragon, the character still has a regular attack as well as skills they can use, and equipment to improve their abilities. Plot The game takes place in the world of Rivellon from Divine Divinity, although much time has passed since the end of Divine Divinity. The player character starts out as a Dragon Slayer at the end of their training, when they are given draconic powers as a way to help fight the last remaining dragons. These powers also erase their memories of their training, but they are reassured that their memories will return quickly. The regular proceedings are interrupted by news of a dragon sighted nearby, so before the initiation is finished, the player character is rushed off with them to where the dragon was last seen. Throughout the game, the hero has several encounters with Damian, the Damned One. Damian is amassing his armies of monsters to destroy Rivellon. He was driven to such actions by the death of his love, Ygerna, at the hands of his adopted father Lucian (The Divine One, the hero from the first game). The player learns of a reversed soul forge Damian placed on him and Ygerna. Meaning that resurrecting Ygerna would kill Damian. After fighting his way through Damian's evil minions and acquiring dragon knight powers. The hero discovers he was tricked into reviving Ygerna and that the reversed soul forge was never real. After reviving Ygerna the player is stuck in a crystal prison inside the hall of echoes. In the expansion, Flames of Vengeance, the Dragon Knight wakes in a crystal prison on the plane of Hypnoteromachia, where Lucian, the Divine, the messiah figure to Rivellon, is also imprisoned. A ghost called Behrilin comes and offers to free the Divine if the Dragon Knight will help to free him from his earthly prison. The ghost transports him to the last city in Rivellon after Damian's campaign of destruction, only still standing due to the magic shield created by the powerful wizard Zandalor. He begs the players help to destroy the invading force and shore up the city's defenses before the shield is broken. Development Development on Divinity II began around 2006, after Larian Studios had acquired enough money to begin development on a Divinity sequel in earnest. From the beginning, the game was planned with the feature of transforming into a dragon in mind, and even included a third form, halfway between the dragon and human forms, which would have served as a powerful form for fighting on the ground. However, it was not implemented in the final game, though the model was reused for enemies in the game. The original concepts included more areas, based on the original map of Rivellon in Divine Divinity, as well as features like multiplayer, co-op, and a greater importance given to the Battle Tower. The game uses the Gamebryo engine, known for its use in Oblivion and Fallout 3. After the initial release of Ego Draconis, Larian was interested in releasing an updated version that would fix many of the bugs and issues with the first game and improve the performance of the engine. At the same time, they developed an expansion that would come after the end of the game, as many people had complained that the original ending of the game had been unsatisfying. The updates to the main game and the expansion were sold together as the Flames of Vengeance add on, or bundled with the core game as The Dragon Knight Saga. Flames of Vengeance and The Dragon Knight Saga were released in Germany in August 2010, and in all other language versions in November 2010. There was no retail United States release of The Dragon Knight Saga until it was released on the Xbox 360 on April 12, 2011, along with a soundtrack CD and an art book. For the tenth anniversary of the Divinity series and the release of the Divinity Anthology, Larian made another update to the game, calling the final version Divinity II: Developer's Cut, which included design documents, concept art, and the ability to access the developer's console in-game through a second executable file.  Marketing  The Ego Draconis Windows Collector's Edition included an 18 cm resin figurine holding a metal letter opener, a cloth-map of Rivellon, a soundtrack EP with seven tracks composed by Kirill Pokrovsky and a temporary tattoo showcasing the Divinity II: Ego Draconis logo. For the release of Divinity II: Developer's Cut on GOG.com, the website ran a promotion on a pay- what-you-want model, where people who purchased the Developer's Cut through the bundle were given early access to the bonus materials and the game itself upon release. Larian released behind-the-scenes videos when the sales numbers reached certain milestones, as well as a tech demo of their first, unfinished game, The Lady, The Mage, and The Knight. Reception On Metacritic, the PC and 360 versions of Ego Draconis have an average score of 72/100 and 62/100 respectively. The Dragon Knight Saga has average scores about ten points higher, with the PC version getting an average of 82/100, and the Xbox 360 version getting an average of 72/100. GameZone Dan Liebman gave both the PC and Xbox 360 versions an 8.4, saying \\"Strong narrative and open-ended design are the highlights of this fantasy experience. Divinity II: Ego Draconis will likely be overlooked by many due to the timing of its release, but it offers a genuinely engrossing world for RPG buffs to wallow in.\\" GameZone also gave the Dragon Knight Saga a 7 out of 10, stating \\"Although the graphical improvements are appreciated, newcomers expecting a visual powerhouse shouldn‚Äôt get their hopes up. A good number of glitches can still be found, visual inconsistencies being one of the most striking. Your overall perception of Rivellon‚Äôs scope isn‚Äôt quite the same as a Bethesda RPG‚Äîit‚Äôs a limited field of view, despite the actual grandeur of the world.\\" IGN scored it a 4.8 out of 10, stating \\"I can‚Äôt recommend the Xbox 360 version of this product to anyone.\\" However, in the review of The Dragon Knight Saga, another IGN reviewer stated \\"If you haven't touched Divinity II at all and you enjoy action-RPGs, you won't be disappointed with the Xbox 360 version.\\"  Sequel  Following the success of Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga, Larian expressed an interest in creating more Divinity games, while also developing the dragon gameplay that was featured in Divinity II. They have announced that one of their next planned games is going to be an action-real time strategy game, with the main character as a Dragon Knight at a time in Rivellon's history when there were many Dragon Knights. The game was released August 6, 2013, and is titled Divinity: Dragon Commander.

It opened as a museum in 1977 and was for a while the only museum in England dedicated solely to the Civil Wars. The Commandery ceased to be a Civil War museum when it reopened to the public in May 2007, having undergone a year and a half of refurbishments and reinterpretation jointly funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and Worcester City Council, who own the building. It is a Grade I listed building. History The Commandery has been used for many different purposes over the many years it has been around. These include: a church, a house, a monastic hospital, hotel, and a museum open to the public. Present exhibits In its current form, it displays six different periods of history, focusing on the characters and stories that affected The Commandery itself at those times. The periods covered are as follows: * The Medieval period, when the Commandery is said to have been founded (possibly 1085,A History of the County of Worcester: volume 2, 1971 Victoria County History, pp. 92-93 though it may have been up to two centuries laterAlan Brooks, Nikolaus Pevsner The Buildings of England, Worcestershire 2007 Yale University Press). It served as an almshouse as well as a place of hospitality for pilgrims and other travellers and was most probably founded by the Order of St John of Jerusalem, the Knights Hospitaller, who named their administrative areas commanderies. * The Tudor period, when following the suppression in 1540 the Commandery became the residence of the Wyldes, a family of clothiers who remained in possession of it until 1785. * The Civil War, when the Commandery was used by Charles II's forces as headquarters during the Battle of Worcester. * The Georgian period, when after its sale by Thomas Wylde in 1785 the Commandery was split into several family homes. * The Victorian period, when the Commandery housed a pioneering school for the \\"blind sons of gentlemen\\". * The 1950s, when the Commandery was used as a printing factory by the Littlebury family. The Commandery includes multimedia exhibits, interactive displays and children's activities.  Foundation  Tradition would suggest that the first building on the Commandery site was constructed in the 11th century on the orders of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester (later Saint Wulfstan), as a hospital or almshouse (today a hospice) for the terminally ill and the destitute and pilgrims. Medieval pictures believed to have been made about 1490 were found in 1935 in what may have been a specially painted chamber for the dying, the pictures showing the life to come. The first written record of its existence does not occur until the 13th century, in 1240 in \\"The Miracles of St. Wulfstan\\". This collection of stories refers to a Thomas of Eldersfield who was blinded and castrated after losing a judicial duel. According to the story Thomas was cared for at the Hospital of St. Wulfstan by Ysabel [sic] a lay sister that took pity on him. Thomas went on to make a miraculous recovery, having both his sight and manhood restored by a miracle of St. Wulfstan. The basic facts of this story appear to be true, as the legal case definitely went before the royal justices in 1221. This would suggest that the hospital was certainly in existence at that point and is nearer the dating of the buildings. Another theory suggests that the hospital was built to mark the canonisation of St. Wulfstan which occurred in 1203. As this date is closer to the first written record of the hospital's existence it is perhaps more likely, however the fact that a chapel incorporated into the site was dedicated to St. Godwald and not St. Wulfstan might suggest that the institution was in fact already in existence in 1203 and rather renamed to mark the canonisation of St. Wulfstan. The name the Commandery suggests the original foundation was instituted possibly by the Knights Hospitaller of the order of St John of Jerusalem in England whose administrative districts, often based just outside city walls, were called commanderies and keep that name today. An example where the chapel has survived but the other buildings have disappeared can be found at Poznan, Poland. The name commandery for their administrative districts remains in use today by the Venerable Order of St John. Alternatively it may have been founded by the Knights Templar. In 1312 by papal decree, the property of the Templars was transferred to the Order of Hospitallers, which also absorbed many of the Templars' members. In effect, the dissolution of the Templars could be seen as the merger of the two rival orders. Whatever the case may be, and it is likely that we will never know, the foundation of the Commandery is certainly shrouded in mystery.  Hospital of St. Wulfstan - the medieval period at the Commandery  What is slightly better documented than the foundation of the hospital is its charitable work. It has traditionally been suggested that the hospital was originally built mainly as a hostel for travellers arriving at Worcester during the night. At dusk the city gates would have been closed, and so this theory makes use of the Commandery's position just outside Sidbury gate. Despite little evidence to support this, it is still considered likely. The first written evidence for the hospital's charitable work is \\"The Tale of Thomas of Eldersfield\\". Another record, of the acceptance of a benefaction from one William de Molendiniis [sic], records that in 1294 there were 22 people in the infirmary, all described as \\"sick\\". By the end of the 14th century, the hospital's work appears to have altered. Several records from the 1390s show that the hospital was granting corrodies, that is, granting people shelter and sustenance for life in return for their property (analogous to purchasing an annuity for a lump sum). Another case, from 1403, refers to Ralph and Alicia Symondes, who were granted a house and money, rather than a place in the hospital, in return for their assets. This particular example highlights that by the 15th century the Hospital of St Wulfstan had become less a charitable care home for the elderly and infirm, but rather a profitable business. By 1441, the ethics of this practice had been called into question, and Bishop Bourchier of Worcester reformed the hospital, banning the granting of corrodies. Bourchier restricted the hospital's activities to handing out a weekly dole of bread to the poor and caring for the sick inmates. He also reorganised the hospital's management structure, appointing a master, two chaplains, five brethren and two sisters. This structure remained in place until the hospital was dissolved in 1540. With the money received as purchase prices of corrodies, masters could become rich and therefore powerful men. Bishop Bourchier's reforms put an end to this, stripping the hospital's financial controls from the master and making it a largely honorific position given to already important people. In the mid to late 15th century the Hospital of St Wulfstan received a large anonymous donation which was put towards a complete rebuilding of the site. The older buildings were apparently completely levelled, except for the chapel of St Godwald; and a completely new structure built in its place. The work was finished around 1460 and it is these buildings which form the core of the Commandery today. The building was clearly divided, with the infirmary to the west and the much grander rooms for the use of the master to the east. The two sides were linked by the Great Hall, which would most likely have been used by the master for entertaining. The original ceiling, a dais and a number of walls still survive in the Great Hall. The solar room, located on the first floor of the western range, was the living quarters of the master, though it remains unclear whether this was his bedroom, living room or both. In the eastern range, also on the first floor, is located the Commandery's \\"painted chamber\\". This room is completely covered in medieval wall paintings which date from the period of the rebuild. Their preservation is due to their Catholic nature: at the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII they were painted over and protected from the damaging sun, obviously seen as popish idolatry. Most of the paintings depict scenes from the lives of saints, for example the martyrdoms of St. Erasmus and St. Thomas Beckett, and St Anne teaching the Virgin Mary to read. Other paintings include the Holy Trinity, the crucifixion of Christ and the weighing of the souls.  The name \\"Commandery\\"  According to Nash (1784) the name the \\"Commandery\\" (pronounced Command-ery) is associated with the Knights of the Crusades. He speculates that the first known master of the Hospital of St Wulfstan, a man known only as Walter, had fought in the Crusades under the banner of either the Knights Templar or the Knights Hospitaler prior to his appointment at the hospital. Walter apparently continued to use his military title of Commander until his death c. 1290, when his successor as master also took on the title, so starting a tradition amongst masters. By association, the residence of the Commander became known as the Commandery. No better explanation than this has been presented, although no modern researches have been undertaken.  Dissolution of the Monasteries The Hospital of St Wulfstan was suppressed in 1540, having been administered since the previous year by one Richard Morysyne [sic], a gentleman of the Royal Privy Chamber and the last master of the hospital. He seems to have been appointed specifically to wind up the affairs of the hospital. The building's wall paintings, as mentioned, were painted over and many more objects of historic and religious value were probably lost. What happened after 1540 is debated. One theory suggests that Richard Morysyne profited greatly from the hospital's dissolution, being granted it for the relatively small sum of ¬£14. The other theory states that Morysyne surrendered the hospital, by this time known as the Commandery, to the king who then donated it to Christ Church, Oxford. In any case, by 1541 the Commandery's owner was leasing the building to one Thomas Wylde, a wealthy Worcester clothier; and in 1545 Thomas bought the Commandery outright for ¬£498. Direct descendants, including Thomas Wylde, MP for Worcester in nine parliaments, continued to own and live in the house until Thomas Wylde of Bridgnorth (d. 25 April 1789) disposed of it in 1785.

She served as a Navy ship until November 1993, and was involved in the Vietnam War and the Persian Gulf War. The ship was transferred to the Military Sealift Command (MSC), and was redesignated USNS San Jose (T-AFS-7). As an MSC vessel, San Jose was involved in the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce, the response to the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, as well as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The ship was deactivated in 2010, and is awaiting scrapping. Design and construction San Jose was laid down on 8 March 1969 by the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, San Diego; launched on 13 December 1969; christened by Mrs. Robert Ellis, III, for the sponsor, her mother, Mrs. George L. Murphy; and commissioned on 23 October 1970, Capt. James H. Morris in command. Operational history United States Navy Following commissioning and fitting out, San Jose, the first combat stores ship of the Pacific Fleet Service Force to receive the U-1500 computer system, conducted training drills; made a short cruise to Acapulco, Mexico, out of San Diego, California; and carried out ship's qualification trials out of Long Beach, California, before steaming to her home port, Oakland Supply Depot, California, in February 1971. Arriving on 10 February, she took on her first PACFILL (Pacific Fleet Issue Load List) stock, and, in March, completed final contract trials. Shakedown and availability followed. In July, she moved north to British Columbia to participate in the observance of that province's Centennial. August took her to Seattle, Washington. On 10 September, she received two UH-46 helicopters from detachment HC-3; and departed Alameda the next day for her first WestPac deployment. The stores ship arrived at Subic Bay, Philippines, on 27 September; topped off her load; and, on 4 October, departed for the Tonkin Gulf and her first line swing. On 6 October, she conducted her first simultaneous vertical replenishment, with her first underway replenishment of a carrier task group occurring the next day. From the Tonkin Gulf, San Jose delivered freight at Danang, Cam Ranh Bay, and Vung Tau; then conducted underway replenishments off the southern coast of South Vietnam before moving on to a port visit at Singapore, whence she headed back to the Philippines to take on more cargo. San Jose returned to Subic Bay on 23 October and, by the end of November, had completed three more line swings. On 10 December, she completed her fifth line swing, and, at mid-month, commenced her sixth. The deployment to the western Pacific Ocean ended on 16 March 1972, when she departed Subic Bay to return to the United States. Proceeding via Apra Harbor, Guam, and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, she arrived in Oakland at the end of the month. San Jose resumed local operations out of Oakland and NAS Alameda, California, until redeploying to the U.S. 7th Fleet on August 26, 1972. She arrived in Subic Bay on 12 September and, after nine months supporting the 7th Fleet in the Far East, departed Sasebo, Japan, on 11 June 1973 to return to the United States. She arrived at San Francisco, California, on the 22d and resumed local operations. Through June 1974, San Jose continued to cruise the western coastline of the United States, based at San Francisco. Following the conclusion of US involvement in the Vietnam War, San Jose was awarded three battle stars for service during the conflict: Consolidation I, Consolidation II, and Vietnam Ceasefire. The ship was stationed at Naval Station Guam from late 1981 to the early 1990s to support the United States Seventh Fleet, along with sister ships and . During 1990 and 1991, she served during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, later known as the Persian Gulf War. Military Sealift Command San Jose at Naval Base Guam in 2010 San Jose was decommissioned and transferred to Military Sealift Command on 2 November 1993. She was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 25 to 31 October 1999. In 2005, San Jose provided logistics support to hospital ship in efforts to provide assistance to victims of the December 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia. San Jose most recently provided logistics support to Navy ships in the Persian Gulf supporting both Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

It claimed a circulation of 20,000 copies before being forced out of business in 2008 due to evidence of massive plagiarism. History The paper was founded in 1969 as a shopper. In 1998, Mike Ladyman, former publisher of Wheels magazine (no relation to the Australian publication) bought the paper and turned it into an alternative weekly. He largely ran it as a mom-and-pop business, delivering the paper himself. He largely left the writing to Mark Williams, a freelance writer who was listed as a staff reporter and music editor. In Ladyman's first year of ownership, the Bulletin received the \\"Most Improved Newspaper\\" award from the Texas Community Newspaper Association. Plagiarism scandal In late July 2008, Slate music critic Jody Rosen got word that a Williams piece about Jimmy Buffett that appeared in the March 2008 Bulletin was almost a verbatim copy of a 2007 piece Rosen had written for Slate. Rosen did a search on Google, and discovered that all of Williams' articles dating back to at least 2005 had been copied wholesale from numerous sources. Williams appeared to have stolen work from diverse publications such as The Guardian, salon.com, NME, Rolling Stone and the Boston Globe. The Buffett article that triggered his initial inquiry, for instance, had been lifted from Rosen's 2007 piece and two other articles. He also found at that Williams had stolen at least one of his other articles for Slate.Free Copy. NPR and WNYC, 2008-08-08. Later, Rosen obtained a copy of the Bulletin's latest issue, and found that nearly every article in it appeared to have been plagiarized. Rosen suggested that \\"in purely statistical terms, [...] the articles in the Montgomery County Bulletin [may] amount to the greatest plagiarism scandal in the annals of American journalism\\". After Rosen published his article on August 6, 2008; some observers suggested that Mark Williams was simply a nom de plume of Mike Ladyman, but in a Houston Press interview Ladyman denied the charge and called Slate's piece ‚Äúan attack, an attention-grabbing hatchet job‚Äù. He also complained of Rosen's attitude in the affair and claimed that he was not given sufficient time and details to react appropriately and diligently. ‚ÄúThe mistake I made was not working fast enough for Jody Rosen and apparently I needed to be punished for it.‚Äù Ladyman announced he was shutting down The Bulletin', and blamed Williams for the plagiarism. Williams himself published a bitter and sarcastic open letter to Rosen in which he wrote, describing himself as the victim of the critic's quest for blogosphere fame: \\"Of course, you are certainly owed an apology, but one has to ponder for a moment just why that is; after all, you have most definitely garnered the attention of the bloggers that you evidently crave in abundance with this manufactured scandal.\\" Williams claimed that he had not intentionally plagiarized articles but had simply used press kit material without realizing that they included work of other journalists: \\"I did so thinking it was cleared for such use; but, as [Rosen] so subtly pointed out, I was mistaken.\\" In turn, Rosen contested the timeline presented by Ladyman, and blamed him for shunning his responsibilities as the newspaper's editor. The scandal also spawned discussion on the thin line which separates plagiarism from very commonplace news aggregation. In the conclusion of his piece, Rosen quipped \\"Mike Ladyman and company may simply be bringing guerrilla-style 21st-century content aggregation to 20th-century print media: publishing the Napster of newspapers.\\" Craig Silverman of Regret the Error described the Bulletin as \\"perhaps the first newspaper to pursue plagiarism as a standard operating procedure.\\"Silverman, Craig. Crunks 2008: The Year in Media Errors and Corrections. Regret The Error, 2008-12-16. Rosen was a guest on NPR's On the Media on August 8, 2008. He suggested that the Bulletin really didn't need a Website because it was a free paper supported by advertising in the print edition. He thought that Williams' plagiarism probably would have gone unnoticed had not the paper's Website opened it up to being searched on Google.

The film was directed by Christian Alvart and produced by Robert Kulzer, Jeremy Bolt and Paul W. S. Anderson. Travis Milloy wrote the screenplay from a story by Milloy and Alvart. It stars Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster. Filming began in Berlin in August 2008. Pandorum was released on 25 September 2009 in the United States, and on 2 October 2009 in the UK. The film's title is a fictional slang term for a form of psychosis called Orbital Dysfunctional Syndrome (ODS) caused by deep space and triggered by emotional stress. This leads to severe paranoia, delirium, and nosebleeding.  Plot  After human overpopulation depletes Earth's resources, humanity builds an interstellar ark, the Elysium. It carries 60,000 people on a 123-year trip to colonize Tanis, an Earth-like planet. The passengers are placed in hypersleep, and a rotating crew wake biennially to maintain the ship. Eight years into the mission, the ship receives a transmission from Earth: \\"You are all that's left of us\\". Some unknown time later, two members of the flight crew, Corporal Bower and Lieutenant Payton, awaken. Improper emergence from the hibernatory state leaves them both with partial amnesia and possibly suffering from pandorum, a space-related disorder that causes psychosis when under emotional duress. The ship experiences power surges caused by an unstable nuclear reactor, and they are unable to enter the bridge. While Payton stays behind to access the ship's computer, Bower uses the ventilation system to search for the reactor. Bower first finds a disemboweled body and a wounded mechanic who tells him to escape \\"them\\". The noise summons a group of cannibalistic humanoids who appear to respond mostly to sound. He continues to encounter a woman, Nadia, and a farmer, Manh, who does not speak English; both are hostile. He encourages them to band together, and the trio flees into a barricaded chamber, where they find a cook named Leland. Leland has been awake for years, living off the water leaking into the ship, the algae it creates, and resorting to cannibalism. Payton encounters Corporal Gallo, who claims the ship is lost in space and that he killed his team in self-defense. Leland feeds Bower's group and shows them mural drawings depicting what has happened: after Earth vanished following an unknown catastrophe, Gallo went insane, killed his crew, and induced pandorum in other passengers. After goading them into a violent and tribal culture, Gallo went back into hypersleep. Aided by accelerated evolution from an enzyme meant to help colonists adjust to life on Tanis, the descendants have turned into cannibalistic mutants. Leland gases the group, intending to eat them, but Bower convinces him the reactor must be stabilized. As they search the ship for the reactor, Bower hopes to find his wife in an area for family in hypersleep but remembers that she died with everyone else on Earth when she refused to join him. This revelation almost makes him give up and pushes him closer to insanity. After surviving an encounter with the cannibals, Bower's group finds the reactor. A crowd of mutants sleep under the reactor, and Bower crosses a walkway to reset it. The walkway collapses, and Bower climbs down into the mutant pit to reach a ladder. While Manh distracts the mutants, Bower restarts the reactor, killing many mutants. Leland flees, and Manh is cornered by the mutant leader. Manh kills the leader but is killed by a mutant child he hesitates to slay. Gallo becomes increasingly agitated, and Payton prepares a sedative. As they wrestle over the sedative, Payton is revealed to be a hallucination of Gallo's. Gallo killed the real Payton long ago when he developed pandorum upon hearing Earth was gone. Because he went into Payton's pod, Gallo mistakenly believed himself to be Payton when he woke up with amnesia. Leland reaches the bridge, and Gallo kills him with the sedative. When Bower and Nadia confront him, Gallo opens the shutters on the bridge's windows, revealing that the ship is adrift in deep space with no stars visible. The shock pushes Bower further toward insanity. Taking advantage of Bower's mental state, Gallo argues they must maintain the violent society rather than revive civilization. Nadia observes bioluminescent ocean life through the windows, and the computer displays that 923 years have elapsed since the mission launched. The ship reached Tanis 800 years ago and landed itself in the ocean. Bower hallucinates a mutant attack and breaks a window. As water pours into the ship, Nadia and Bower climb into a hypersleep pod. The flood triggers an emergency protocol which ejects all active pods to the surface, while Gallo and the remaining mutants drown. Bower and Nadia surface near a lush coastline, and they witness the other pods ascend.  Cast   Production  The film began life as a preliminary script written by Travis Milloy in the late 1990s. The story was originally set on a prison ship named Pandorum, transporting thousands of Earth's deadliest prisoners to another planet; the cannibal hunters were the end result of the prisoners' degeneration. The characters played by Antje Traue and Cung Le were inmates. Ben Foster's character was a non-prisoner who did not trust anyone. Believing no studio would want to make the film, Milloy thought about making it as a low-budget film shot on video in an abandoned paper mill with unknown actors. However, it attracted the attention of filmmaker Paul W. S. Anderson and Jeremy Bolt, and they gave it to Impact Pictures, who green-lit it. The producers gave the script to director Christian Alvart who was struck by the similarities to his own screenplay titled No Where. His dramatic story was about four astronauts aboard a settlers' ship who suffer from amnesia. Alvart decided that they should meld the two screenplays together, and the producers and Milloy agreed. With the ship now changed to a settler's ship, the use of the word \\"Pandorum\\" was changed from the name of the ship to a type of mental illness caused by sustained deep space travel. Pandorum was announced in May 2008 with Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster in lead roles. Christian Alvart was attached to direct the film, based on a script by Travis Milloy. The movie was financed by Constantin Film through a joint venture deal with subsidiary Impact Pictures. The partnership helped fund the $40 million production. Constantin drew subsidies from Germany's Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg (MBB) regional film fund, the (FFA) and the (DFFF). The German Federal Film Fund provided $6 million to the production, the fund's second-largest 2008 payout after $7.5 million for Ninja Assassin. Filming took place at Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam in August 2008.  Release, director's cut, and sequel  Ben Foster, Cung Le and Antje Traue talk about Pandorum at a panel discussion at WonderCon 2009. Summit Entertainment handled foreign sales and presented Pandorum to buyers at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, but due to a deal with Contender Films in the UK, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures took over and handled foreign sales to the film. Overture Films distributed Pandorum in North America, Icon in the United Kingdom and Australia, Svensk Filmindustri in Scandinavia, and Movie Eye in Japan. The film was set up as a possible franchise. According to Travis Milloy, it was to have a sequel and a prequel. If it performed well, Impact Pictures could green-light one or more sequels. The DVD and Blu-ray Disc release occurred on 19 January 2010 in the United States over Anchor Bay Entertainment. The director and producer commentaries on the DVD indicate that an unrated version of the movie exists but has not been released.  Reception  Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 28% based on 85 reviews and an average rating of 4.21/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"While it might prove somewhat satisfying for devout sci-fi fans, Pandorum's bloated, derivative plot ultimately leaves it drifting in space.\\" At Metacritic, which judges on a 0‚Äì100 scale, the film holds a \\"generally unfavorable\\" score of 28 based on 13 reviews. Science fiction magazine SFX stated that \\"Pandorum is the finest interstellar horror in years\\" and awarded the film 4 stars out of 5. Film Ireland also gave Pandorum a positive review, appreciating the film's synergy of cinematic techniques, set design, and developed characters. The film grossed $20.6 million worldwide on a $33 million budget. The film opened at No. 6 at the US box office with weekend receipts totaling $4.4 million. Poor return due to lack of promotion was a contributing factor to Overture Films' declaration of bankruptcy several months later.
