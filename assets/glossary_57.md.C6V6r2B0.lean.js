Educated in England, Fern√°ndez studied archaeology, art and music before returning to Costa Rica. Involved in amateur archaeological digs and charitable works, she wrote articles for publication in local newspapers and magazines and published two novels. When her husband staged a coup d'√©tat and was later elected President of Costa Rica, she served as First Lady from 8 June 1917 to 20 August 1919. When he resigned from his post due to mismanagement, the couple moved to Paris, where she participated in archeological and artistic works until his death in 1931. From 1932 to 1934, she resided in Norway before returning to Costa Rica, where she resumed her archeological studies and publishing, while working for the National Museum of Costa Rica. Involved with the Red Cross, she was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal in 1949 and in 2012, the Ministry of Culture of Costa Rica produced a documentary about her life. Early life Mar√≠a de las Mercedes Elodia Fern√°ndez Le Cappellain, known as Mimita, was born on 22 January 1877 in San Jos√©, Costa Rica to Ada Le Cappellain Agnew and Mauro Fern√°ndez Acu√±a. She was the second of the couple's seven children. Her father was a politician and was involved in the creation of the first secondary school for women in Costa Rica, having hired his sister-in-law, Marian Le Cappellain to found the school. Both Ada and her sister Marian were natives of the Channel Islands, grew up on Guernsey, and had previously taught in Costa Rica. After studying with Juanita Acu√±a, Fern√°ndez completed her education abroad in England, studying archaeology, art and music. She returned to Costa Rica and on 5 June 1898 in San Jos√©, married Federico Alberto de Jes√∫s Tinoco Granados. Federico's family were friends of her parents, and like Fern√°ndez, he had been educated abroad. Career While husband became involved in politics, Fern√°ndez de Tinoco became involved as one of the founding members of the Theosophical Society in 1904. She was interested in learning about and exploring indigenous cultures and began making amateur archaeological digs on the family farm. One such dig in 1907, led her to conceive of the plot for a novel. In 1909, under the pseudonym Apaik√°n published two works Yont√° and Zulai in a single volume. The novels were the first works by a Costa Rican author to focus on indigenous people. Yont√° gives the background story for Zulai, though it was written last. Both are based on theosophical themes and deal with the sentimental entanglement of two generations of lovers. In Yont√°, the main character's name, an indigenous woman meets a mystic from India who brings eastern rituals and religion to the Americas. The couple produce a son, Ivo, who in the second book, Zulai, falls in love with Zulai. Their love is tragically doomed by the jealousy of the caciques. In addition to the novels, Fern√°ndez de Tinoco published other scholarly works on archaeology and was a collaborator with √Ångela Acu√±a Braun in the journal F√≠garo, which had been founded in 1914. She also devoted time to charitable endeavors, such as co- founding the Costa Rican branch of La Gota de Leche (A Drop of Milk) and El Abrigo de los Ni√±oswas (The Children's Shelter) in 1913 and becoming involved in 1915 with the first Boy Scout Troop of Costa Rica. She published articles on a variety of subjects in newspapers, including the Diario de Costa Rica, La Hora, and La Rep√∫blica, and magazines like Repertorio Americano and Revista de Archivos Nacionales. On 27 January 1917, Fern√°ndez de Tinoco's husband, Federico, staged a coup d'√©tat overthrowing the presidency of Alfredo Gonz√°lez Flores and in the elections that followed in April, he was elected president. When his term began on 8 June 1917, Fern√°ndez de Tinoco became the First Lady of Costa Rica, acting as the hostess of numerous banquets, receptions and public ceremonies, on behalf of her husband. She continued her charitable works, establishing the Children's Commissary of San Jos√© ( and was involved with the Costa Rican branch of the Red Cross. Abuses and mistakes in her husband's government forced her husband to resign on 20 August 1919. The couple fled the country, traveling by way of Jamaica to Paris. In France, Fern√°ndez de Tinoco joined a group of archaeologists and continued to participate in the field. She also served as an assistant to launch the Exhibition of Aboriginal Art of Spanish America, held in 1928 in Paris. When her husband died in 1931, she moved to Oslo, where her sister Ada, and brother-in-law, Antonio J. de Amaral Murtinho, were living. She attended a reception for Lord Baden Powell, founder of the Boy Scouts, held in Oslo in 1932, but within two years, decided to return home to Costa Rica. Taking a position with the National Museum of Costa Rica, Fern√°ndez de Tinoco, undertook archaeological expeditions throughout the country for the next six years. One of these expeditions made in 1935, to Chira Island was discussed in a paper Chira, la olvidada cuna de aguerridas tribus precolombinas (Chira, the forgotten cradle of warlike pre-Columbian tribes) and another Una ocarina huetar de 18 notas del Museo Nacional de Costa Rica (An ocarina of the Huetar people with eighteen notes in the National Museum of Costa Rica). She also worked as a teacher and then briefly lived in Rio de Janeiro, where her sister Ada and her family had been transferred when their time in Oslo ended. Between 1943 and 1946, she lived in Winona, Minnesota with a friend, Harriet Buck and spent time working with the American Red Cross and in 1949, Fern√°ndez de Tinoco was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal. She participated as a delegate for Costa Rica in the August 1946 International Conference of Archaeologists, which was held in Honduras and in 1950, helped in the organization of the Central American Art Exhibition held in Panama. After this time, she began to have heart problems and slowly withdrew from public activities. Death and legacy Fern√°ndez de Tinoco died on 23 November 1961 in San Jos√©, Costa Rica. In 2012, a documentary, La ocarina de Cuesta de Moras (The ocarina of the Cuesta de Moras, which is the address of the National Museum and a play on the title of her 1937 article on the ocarina) was produced by the Ministry of Culture and Youth, detailing the life story of Fern√°ndez de Tinoco.

Initially it will replace the capability of Zenit-2 and Proton Medium, and in the future will serve as the base of a super heavy-lift launch vehicle rocket (Yenisei) to match the Energia/Buran capabilities. It is expected to launch from the Baikonur Baiterek, the ex Zenit-2 launch site, in a partnership with the government of Kazakhstan, with a planned debut of 2022.  Project organization  The current proposal is led by JSC SRC Progress, with support by Khrunichev and Makeyev, additionally, RSC Energia would handle the launch site, and supply the Blok DM-03, while Roscosmos would finance the development through the Project Fenicks under the 2016-2025 Russian space master plan. KazCosmos would also be a partner since the initial launch pad would be at Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 45 in Kazakhstan, within the framework of the Baiterek bi-national joint venture, and International Launch Services (ILS) would commercialize its services for the international market. The initial application of the launch vehicle would be to cover the under to GTO commercial launch segment. With the loss of the Zenit-3SLB due to Russian conflicts with Ukraine, both the decision not to develop Angara A3 and launch Angara A5 from Vostochny, the Baiterek project was without a launch vehicle. The 2016 announcement of the Proton Medium and Light meant that ILS could enter the medium GTO launch market, but since the Kazakh government desired to deprecate the use of highly toxic hypergolic propellants used by Proton, they would need a replacement. For this commercial application, JSC SRC Progress proposed the Soyuz-5 in early 2016. It would start with this commercial application with the prospect of also enabling a super heavy launcher with a payload capability to low Earth orbit. The Kazakh side agreed on the general terms, but the investment share was left to decide. As part of the 2016 arrangements, the Kazakh government would get ownership of one the Proton launch pads, and participate in the operations of Proton-Medium and Proton-Light. Then, they would get to participate in the Irtysh launchers since its expected debut in 2022. Four test launches are planned before the development is considered complete.  Vehicle  Soyuz-5, as proposed in 2016, leverages existing propulsion and tooling, while enabling a platform that would replace the lost capabilities of the Zenit family, replace the Proton Light/Medium, and could serve as the boosters of a new super heavy rocket. It will initially be a two-stage rocket, but could be enhanced with an optional Blok DM-03 for geostationary missions. It would be compatible with most of the Zenit's ground infrastructure, and even use the Site 45 at Baikonur. Its tanks would be in diameter, which would enable the re use of Proton tooling. Since they would be wider than Zenit, () it would enable a higher propellant load for the same height. While this diameter enables a heavier rocket and is already compatible with train transport to Baikonur, it would prevent that cheap method for Vostochny Cosmodrome. It would use the relatively environmental friendly RG-1/LOX propellant, which would be an improvement over the highly toxic hypergolics of Proton. This has been a requirement from the Kazakh government for new projects. The first stage would be powered by an RD-171MV, very similar to the RD-171M used in Zenit 2 and 3. With a height of it would be higher than Zenit's first stage () and wider, and thus it could carry of propellant versus . Its base would still feature a aft section for compatibility with Zeni't pad and support infrastructure. Its second stage would measure by in diameter, with a dry mass of and an RG-1/LOX load of . It would be powered by two RD-0124MS engines each with four nozzles arranged in a semicircle, so two engines would feature eight total nozzles close to rocket perimeter, forming a circle. This arrangement would minimize the stage length, while keeping the engines excellent specific impulse. With a gross mass of against Zenit , and the improved efficiency of its second stage, it could launch to a 200 km circular orbit with an inclination of 51.6¬∞ to the Equator from Baikonur. This is a significant improvement over Zenit, which could only place roughly to the same orbit. For geostationary launch missions, it could optionally be equipped with a Blok DM-03 third stage. Since it would use the same propellant and is already used on the Zenit-3SL and Angara A5, it would be a low risk option. The expected performance of to GTO and to GSO, it would improve over Zenit-3SLB and .  Soyuz-5 Super Heavy (Yenisei)  comparison The Irtysh first stage could be used as the boosters (and even core) of the super heavy rocket Yenisei capable of launching to low Earth orbit from Baikonur or Vostochny. Improving the performance to and even was considered possible with this architecture. While the current 2016-2025 plan for deep space exploration calls for the use of the heavy Angara 5V, it would just enable , requiring up to four launches for a single Moon mission. And would also require the use of expensive hydrogen as fuel. The Yenisei would simplify the mission while using readily available Irtysh first stages.

He primarily competed within the National Wrestling Alliance, where he is a former NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion, and also competed in promotions such as the World Wrestling Association, the WWE and Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre. Fellow wrestlers have called Kirby \\"one of the greatest performers to ever work in the squared circle\\". Early life Willis Kirby was born on December 14, 1939 in Muncie, Indiana and raised in Dunkirk, Indiana. He is a cousin of fellow professional wrestler Les Thatcher Professional wrestling career A Golden Gloves boxer prior to entering professional wrestling, he was trained in grappling by Dick the Bruiser and The Sheik in Indianapolis. After graduating in 1957, Kirby attended a wrestling event at his high school, where he got into an altercation with Ron Shire for standing on the ring apron. After telling his mother about this, he was informed that his cousin's husband was a wrestler named \\"Cowboy\\" Dennis Hall. That Sunday, Kirby visited Hall and soon thereafter was wrestling as Wild Bill Baker. He worked at a glass factory while he underwent his wrestling training and four years later he was working full-time as a professional wrestler. As was custom prior to the 1990s due to kayfabe, Kirby would often accept if he was challenged at a bar. Despite being almost 6 feet and 230lbs, Kirby stated that he \\"was very aggressive because (he was) small, and stayed in shape so (he) could be aggressive.\\" Kirby made his name wrestling through the territories of Georgia, Florida, Oregon, Minnesota and Kansas City (where he lives today). He was a prolific traveller, competing throughout the National Wrestling Alliance. With blonde hair and a resemblance to his close friend Buddy Rogers he took on the moniker \\"Nature Boy\\", wrestling as a heel and taking on numerous world champions, including Pat O'Connor. He also wrestled overseas in Mexico and Puero Rico, along with six tours wrestling in Japan. Fellow wrestler and booker Bill Howard has stated that \\"Roger was the best there ever was. He could do everything that they're doing today, and probably even better. He had the body, the looks, the arrogance.\\" In 1967, Kirby won his first championship, when he and Les Thatcher won the NWA (Mid-America) United States Tag Team Championship. He would achieve success as a tag team competitor throughout the Mid America and Gulf Coast territories throughout the same year, winning the NWA Gulf Coast Tag Team Championship three times and the NWA (Gulf Coast) United States Tag Team Championship, all with his relative, Dennis Hall. For the rest of the 1960s, he became a successful singles competitor throughout the American South, becoming a prominent star in the Central States and Pacific Northwest territories. He defeated Ron Etchison on August 12, 1969 to capture the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship and won the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship two times (both with victories over Moondog Mayne) the following year in 1969. On May 20, 1971 Kirby defeated Danny Hodge to become the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion. Bill Watts had decided that Kirby was the man to carry the Junior Heavyweight title, which he went on to lose to Ramon Torres. Hodge called Kirby a \\"first class\\" wrestler who had \\"the right personality, the right actions, the right steps\\". In turn, Kirby stated that Hodge was the toughest man he ever wrestled with. As champion, Kirby worked extensive programmes with Tom Jones, with whom he started with wrestling in Indiana. \\"We sold out everything we touched\\" Kirby remarked about his bouts with Jones. Kirby continued to capture NWA championships throughout the 1970s and on April 1, 1978, he teamed with Igor Volkoff to win the WWA Tag Team Championship. The following year he won the titles on two more occasions, both times with Paul Christy. Roger Kirby briefly wrestled for the World Wrestling Federation in 1986 (where he also refereed a few matches in Kansas City) but gave it up and retired from the wrestling business, stating that he \\"wanted to be remembered as a top wrestler\\", feeling that the time of his in- ring retirement had come. He stated \\"I'd done everything that I wanted to do...I didn't want to go back down the ladder.\\" Personal life After retirement, Kirby had both knees and hips replaced along with his shoulder. In 2010, he was honoured by the Cauliflower Alley Club and was awarded their annual Men's Wrestling Award. He lived in Grandview, Missouri, a suburb of Kansas City where he bred exotic fish and enjoyed amateur photography. He was married and had seven children.

In other words, emotions are systems that respond to environmental input, such as a social or physical challenge, and produce adaptive output, such as a particular behavior. Under such accounts, emotions can manifest in maladaptive feelings and behaviors, but they are largely beneficial insofar as they inform and prepare individuals to respond to environmental challenges, and play a crucial role in structuring social interactions and relationships. Researchers who subscribe to a functional perspective of emotions disagree as to whether to define emotions and their respective functions in terms of evolutionary adaptation or in terms of socially constructed concepts. However, the goal of a functional account of emotions is to describe why humans have specific emotions, rather than to explain what exactly constitutes an emotion. Thus, functionalists generally agree that in order to infer the functions of specific emotions, researchers should examine the causes, or input, and consequences, or output, of those emotions. The events that elicit specific emotions and the behavioral manifestations of those emotions can vary significantly based on individual and cultural context. Thus, researchers claim that a functional account of emotions should not be understood as a rigid input and output system, but rather as a flexible and dynamic system that interacts with an individual's goals, experiences, and environment to adaptively shape individuals‚Äô emotional processing and responding.  History  Historically, emotions were primarily understood and studied in terms of their maladaptive consequences. For example, Stoicism, an Ancient Greek tradition of philosophy, described how most emotions, particularly negative emotions like anger, are irrational and prevent people from achieving inner peace. Early psychologists followed this approach, often describing how emotions interfere with rational deliberation and can lead to reckless behaviors that risk well-being or relationships. Around the 1960s, however, the focus of emotions research began shifting towards the beneficial consequences of emotions, and a growing body of psychological research contributed to understanding emotions as functional. For example, emotions structure relationships by facilitating bonding that promotes survival. Additionally, the expression of emotions can coordinate group behavior, thus promoting cooperation and collaboration. Interdisciplinary research in fields such as cultural psychology, sociology, and anthropology found that sociocultural norms often interact with and even emerge from individual and collective emotional experiences, providing further support for the role of emotions in organizing social life. While some researchers retained that emotions may have once been functional but are no longer necessary in the present environment, many researchers began to adopt the now-dominant view that emotions are systems that aim to provide solutions to problems in the present-day environment.  Emotion functions  A functional account of any system assesses its specific function in terms of the factors that elicit the activation of that system, and the changes that follow the activation of that system. Importantly, not every cause and consequence of a system pertains to its primary function; the primary function is the specific purpose that the system fulfills. For example, tools have specific functions that are defined in terms of why the tool has certain features and the problem that it typically solves. So, while a pair of scissors can be used as a weapon, or a paper-weight, the sharp blades of scissors were designed to cut, and the problem that scissors typically solve is the need to cut something. Thus, the primary function of scissors is to cut. Functional accounts of emotion similarly define the functions of specific emotions in terms of why those emotions are associated with certain features, such as particular bodily and cognitive changes, as well as the environmental problem that the emotion helps to solve. For example, why is anger typically associated with an increase in heart rate and the desire to approach the source of anger. When people become angry in response to an environmental problem, how does it help them change their environment in a way that benefits them? Emotion researchers attempt to answer such questions in relation to various prominent emotions, including negative emotions such as sadness, embarrassment, and fear, and positive emotions such as love, amusement, and awe. In order to identify the primary function of each emotion, researchers investigate its intrapersonal functions, or how emotions function at the level of the individual to help them navigate their surroundings, and interpersonal functions, or how emotions function at the group level to facilitate efficient communication, cooperation, and collaboration. = Intrapersonal functions = In investigating the intrapersonal functions of emotions, or how emotions help individuals navigate and respond to their environments, researchers typically document the physiological changes, subjective experiences, and behavioral motivations associated with different emotions. For example, anger is associated with high arousal, feelings of disapproval or dissatisfaction with some event, and the motivation to express that disapproval or take action against the source of dissatisfaction. Given how emotional responses affect individual experience and behavior, researchers describe the intrapersonal function of specific emotions in terms of how they inform and prepare individuals to respond to a particular environmental challenge. For example, feeling anger usually informs individuals of something unjust in the environment, such as betrayal from a loved one, threats of physical violence from a bully, or corruption. Anger is associated with blood flow in the body shifting away from internal organs towards the limbs, physiologically preparing individuals for movement towards the cause of anger. Even when locomotion or physical confrontation is not required to address an unjust actor or event, the high arousal and emotional sensitivity associated with anger tend to motivate individuals to confront the issue. Emotional responses tend to diminish once the emotion elicitor, or the environmental cause of the emotion, changes, suggesting that emotions at the individual level function to evoke some sort of action or behavior to address the elicitor. For example, anger typically diminishes following an apology or the perception that justice has been restored.Haidt, J. (2003). The moral emotions. In R. J. Davidson, K. R. Scherer, & H. H. Goldsmith (Eds.), Handbook of affective sciences. Oxford: Oxford University Press.(pp. 852‚Äì870). = Interpersonal functions = A crucial aspect of how emotions help individuals adaptively navigate the world is tied to their interpersonal functions, or how they influence social interactions and relationships. Emotional expressions, such as a smile or a frown, are relatively involuntary, so they can provide a fairly reliable source of information about a person's emotions, beliefs, and intentions to those around them. The communication of such information is crucial for structuring social relationships, and for negotiation and cooperation within groups, because it conveys not only how people are thinking and feeling, but also how they are likely to behave. This information can in turn guide how other people think, feel, and behave towards those expressing their emotions. For example, emotional expressions can evoke complementary emotional responses, such as fear in response to anger, or guilt in response to disappointment. They can also evoke reciprocal emotions, such as empathy or love.Eisenberg, N., Shea, C. L., Carlo, G., & Knight, G. P. (1991). Empathy- related responding and cognition: A \\"chicken and the egg\\" dilemma. In W. M. Kurtines & J. L. Gewirtz (Eds.), Handbook of moral behavior and development (pp. 63‚Äì88). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. Thus, emotions play a crucial role in conveying valuable information in social interactions that can rapidly coordinate group behavior even in the absence of explicit verbal communication. Given this communicative role of emotions, emotions facilitate learning by serving as incentives or deterrents for certain kinds of actions or behaviors. For example, when children see how their parents or friends emotionally respond to things they do, they learn what types of actions and behaviors are likely to lead to desirable outcomes, including positive emotional responses from those around them. This communicative role is important in informing how people behave in both professional and intimate adult human relationships as well, since emotions can convey how a particular relationship or interaction is evolving in positive or negative directions. For example, anger can signal that an individual or group has reached its limit within a negotiation, and can immediately structure the behavioral responses from the opposite party. Meanwhile, sadness can communicate the readiness to disengage from a goal, and the potential for social withdrawal from a person or group, thereby conveying that a potentially valuable relationship is at risk. Emotions have also been found to play a role in organizing group identity insofar as shared emotional experiences tend to strengthen communal identity, in-group solidarity, and cultural identity.Heise, D. R., & O‚ÄôBrien, J. (1993). Emotion expression in groups. Handbook of emotions, 489‚Äì497. Furthermore, emotions play a role in defining and identifying an individual's role within a group, such that the specific role that an individual assumes (ex. nurturing, protecting, leading) is associated with the expression of particular emotions, such as sympathy, anger, fear, or embarrassment. = Negative and positive emotion = Researchers who adopt a functional perspective of emotions have devoted attention to several prevalent emotions. For example, research suggests that the function of anger is to correct injustice, the function of sadness is to disengage from an unattainable goal, the function of embarrassment is to appease others, and the function of fear is to avoid danger.Izard, C. E. (1993). Organizational and motivational functions of discrete emotions. The focus of emotions research for some time was on negative emotions, with positive emotions primarily being understood as ‚Äúundoing‚Äù the arousing effects of negative emotion. In other words, while negative emotions increase arousal to help individuals address an environmental problem, positive emotions quell that arousal to return an individual to baseline. While positive emotions can return individuals to baseline following a negative emotional experience, for example joy after an angering event has been addressed, or amusement that distracts from sadness, positive emotions themselves can increase arousal from baseline. Thus, a growing body of literature describes the distinct functions of positive emotions. For example, research suggests that the function of romantic love is to facilitate mating, the function of amusement is to facilitate play,Pellegrini, A. D., & Smith, P. K. (Eds.). (2005). The nature of play: Great apes and humans. Guilford Press. which encourages learning, and the function of awe is to accommodate new information.  Variability  Emotions are highly personal insofar as they play a critical role in defining an individual's subjective experiences and interact with how individuals think about and judge the world around them. Since individuals differ in their personal goals and past experiences, individuals within one society or group can vary greatly in how they experience and express specific emotions. Emotions are also highly social insofar as they facilitate communication and often arise in response to the actions or feelings of other people. Given their highly social nature, the ways that emotions are experienced and expressed, and the specific roles that they play in structuring interactions and relationships, can vary significantly according to social and cultural context. For example, research investigating cultural differences in facial expressions found that East Asian models of anger show characteristic early signs of emotional intensity with the eyes, which are under less voluntary control than the mouth, as compared with Western Caucasian models. Such findings suggest that contextual factors such as a particular society's display rules may directly modulate both how an emotion is expressed, and how it is perceived and responded to by others. Furthermore, some emotions are generally experienced less in certain societies. For example, anger is not frequently reported amongst Utku Eskimos. Given this immense variation in how individuals experience and express emotions, functionalists emphasize the dynamic quality of emotion systems. Under a functional account, emotion systems process feedback from the environment about when and how various emotions are likely to serve adaptive functions in a specific environment. In other words, emotion systems are flexible and can incorporate information that an individual learns across their lifespan to modify how the system operates. Furthermore, emotions interact with cognition such that how an individual learns and thinks about their own emotions can affect how they experience and express emotions.Scarantino, Andrea. ‚ÄúBasic Emotions, Psychological Construction and the Problem of Variability.‚Äù The Psychological Construction of Emotion, James Russell and Lisa Barrett, eds, Guilford Press (2014), 334‚Äì376.

It is also illegal to sell counterfeit drugs in the United Kingdom. The fake drugs are sometimes termed as imitation controlled substances. Types of counterfeited illicit drugs Some fake drugs consist of substances from relatively harmless sources, such as grocery store goods like flour, oregano or allergy pills. Even despite the substances' harmlessness, legal penalties for the crime of selling them can include time in jail. Certain fake drugs include other controlled drugs, or they may include synthetic drugs with similar properties. Uncertainty of an identity of the substance may increase the risk of an overdose. A related, yet distinct, problem is the trade of counterfeit medications with pills including substances such as fentanyl which can be used recreationally. Relation to drug-related crimes There is a low chance of law punishing fraud among illicit drug traders, however it is likely that informal social control among drug traders reduces the likelihood of fraud between illegal trade partners. For instance, getting robbed or losing a business contact may not justify dealer's increased profits for a short-term from fraudulent behavior. Legal status Selling counterfeit illicit drugs is illegal even if the substances used to make the imitation drug are not illegal on themselves. It is illegal to distribute or sell counterfeit fake drugs in many U.S. states including Nevada, Ohio, Illinois, Florida, Michigan and Massachusetts. Selling counterfeit illicit drugs is also illegal in the Arizona United Kingdom. =U.S. Federal Law= Selling counterfeit illicit drugs is illegal under the U.S. federal law.

Barnes held a number of posts in the government of Sarawak and later in the government of Hong Kong, his first major post being the Deputy Secretary for Security, a department for which he would later serve as Secretary in the late 1980s. Barnes also served as Deputy Secretary for Health and Welfare and as the 4th Commissioner of the Independent Commission Against Corruption.  Early life  Barnes was born on the 18th of August 1932 in Malacca, Malaya to parents Thomas Arthur Barnes and Ethel Maud Walker. He attended Dover College in Southeast England, and went on to study Anthropology at St Catherine's College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge, he took part in an expedition to Lake Tana, Ethiopia, an account of which was published by Collins in 1955.  Career  = Early career = Barnes served as a government official in the British colonial administration of Sarawak from 1956 to 1963, and remained in Sarawak's government throughout their transition to independence until 1968. In 1970, Barnes joined the government of Hong Kong, where he served as the Assistant Defence Secretary until 1972. Following this, Barnes held the posts of Police Civil Secretary until 1976 and then Assistant Director for the Commerce and Industry Department until 1977. = Deputy Secretary for Security = Barnes' first major government position came 1977 when he was promoted to Deputy Secretary for Security for Hong Kong under Secretary Lewis Mervyn Davis. Over his four years in the role Barnes was at the forefront of many of the national and international security threats that faced Hong Kong, most notably, his responsibility in dealing with the exodus of Vietnamese Boat People in 1978-79. = Deputy Secretary for Health and Welfare = In 1983, Barnes undertook the role as Deputy Secretary for Health, with his tenure being noted for its extensive efforts in improvements in public health. Barnes led the effort to formulate and pass the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance in 1982, a law targeting smoking bans and the regulation of sales of tobacco products. The law was passed successfully and was received well by both the government and the public. It provided the foundation for multiple amendments and developments in Hong Kong's smoking laws, culminating in an amendment in 2007 which vastly expanded the ban on smoking in most public places. The 1982 law is credited with the long-term reduction in smoking in Hong Kong, with 2015 figures indicating the overall daily smoking rate was 10.5%, a significant decline from the rate of 23.3% in the early 1980s. = Commissioner of the ICAC = Barnes oversaw a push by the ICAC to identify and deal with corruption in Hong Kong's financial institutions. This led to investigations into allegations of fraud and corruption against more than 20 banks and financial institutions. Barnes said such probes had become a major part of the work of the investigative body, which has police powers of arrest but operates independently of all other police and government offices. Barnes oversaw an expansion of the ICAC's institutional reach, building on its reputation as an effective regional example of dealing with anti-corruption. = Later career = Barnes later worked as a consultant for the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office, offering insight, advice and expertise on anti- corruption and security measures. Additionally, Barnes also served as the president of the ICAC Association from 1993 until 1998.  Later life  Barnes retired from Hong Kong in 1990 and returned to Surrey, England, with his wife Agnete. During his retirement Barnes took the time to write up his memoirs of his decades working and living in East Asia in the form of two published works: Mostly Memories: Packing and Farewells and With the Dirty Half-Hundred in Malaya: Memories of National Service, 1951-52.

Her father, who managed a local bank, had been brought up in Chile. She was with her family as they moved to Richmond and then to Bognor Regis until at fourteen she was sent to a boarding school run by her cousins. She was a voracious student and she decided to take up the challenge of a career in medicine. She had a Bedford College scholarship but decided to study at the London School of Medicine for Women. Hanson qualified in 1904 and went to work at the St Pancras Infirmary. She took at a certificate in tropical medicine in 1905. She worked at the Hospital for Women and Children at Bristol, and the Morpeth and Menston county asylums before deciding to leave the country. She had decided to take her skills to India like her role model Mary Scharlieb (who had taught her obstetrics and gynaecology). Unusually she opted to be a missionary for the Zenana Bible and Medical Missionary Society. A Zenana is an area of a house or building set aside for women. She left from Exeter Hall in 1905 and set out for Lucknow to work at the Kinnaird Memorial Hospital which was named for Mary Jane Kinnaird. Hanson was given a level of responsibility and she was hospital's director when the usual person went on holiday. She had learnt Urdu and she worked hospitals at Benares and Jaunpur and St. Luke's Zenana Hospital at Palampur. However she left India in 1909 and chose to travel in steerage class so that she could donate the five pounds saved to the suffragette cause. She remained interested in missionary work but did not feel well enough to return. However India had affected her spiritually she said that her experience in India of different religions and \\"Hinduism especially‚Äîhas‚Ä¶ left me with a far greater conception of God\\", stemming from the affinities she found between the incarnational theology of Charles Gore and Hinduism.https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2012/28-september/features/features/private- lives-made-public She became a member of the Church of England on her return. She had been brought up in a family who was politically active and in support of women having the vote. Unlike her parents she believed in militancy. She joined Emmeline Pankhurst's Women's Social and Political Union and she was one of those arrested on Black Friday. Two hundred suffragettes had been arrested as they tried to enter the Houses of Parliament. The event attracted wide attention. The deputation was led by Emmeline Pankhurst to petition Asquith. The delegates included Dorinda Neligan, Hertha Ayrton, Dr Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, Dr Louisa Garrett Anderson, Anne Cobden-Sanderson, and Princess Sophia Duleep Singh.Sybil Oldfield, ‚ÄòNeligan, Dorinda (1833‚Äì1914)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 14 November 2017. Under the name, Helen Rice, she served five days in prison. Her main efforts were directed towards the Church League for Women's Suffrage (later League of the Church Militant ) where she had been a founding member of this Anglican group in 1909. She had also been a member of the University of London Suffrage Society, the Women's Freedom League, the Industrial Christian Fellowship, the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene and the League of Nations Union. Under the auspices of the Church league she had published her own ideas of how suffragists and missionaries should combine their forces. During the first war she served with the Red Cross before she was transferred to the Scottish Women's Hospital Unit. She was one of the few women to serve with the Royal Army Medical Corps and she was given the rank of Captain. She served in France, Turkey, Malta and Serbia and was given medals to record her services. The medals were the 1914 Star with clasp, the British War and Victory Medals, the Order of St. Sava, 2nd type from Serbia, 4th Class breast badge and a Red Cross Decoration. After the war she joined an expeditionary force at the Black Sea. She served with that group until 1920 when she returned to her pre-war job. She was one of London county council' assistant school medical officers. She continued to submit contributions to suffrage publications and the British Medical Journal.

It has been designated a scheduled monument since 1997. The Hall was built by Sir John Savile, a Yorkshire politician and courtier, at the end of the 16th century. It remained in the hands of the Savile family until 1671, and was the site of fighting during the English Civil War in 1643. Subsequently it passed into the hands of the Brudenell family, under whose ownership the Hall deteriorated and was eventually demolished between 1717 and 1730.  History  Howley Hall was built by John Savile, 1st Baron Savile of Pontefract, probably between 1585 and 1590. Savile, who held a number of county offices in Yorkshire, was part of a new protestant political elite that emerged from the English Reformation. Like many of his contemporaries, he sought to show his status through the construction of an impressive country house. He employed a local architect, Abraham Ackroyd, to design the Hall, which was built in an Elizabethan style reminiscent of the work of Robert Smythson. The Hall remained in the possession of the Savile family for just under a century. Upon John's death in 1630 it was inherited by his son, Thomas Savile, 1st Earl of Sussex. During the English Civil War (1642‚Äì1651) Lord Sussex vacillated between supporting the Royalists and the Parliamentarians, but he left the Hall in the keeping of his relative Sir John Savile of Lupset, a Parliamentarian. Thomas Fairfax used it as a base of operations for the Parliamentary capture of Wakefield in May 1643, which prompted Royalist forces under the Earl of Newcastle to launch a retaliatory attack on Bradford. To ensure the Parliamentary garrison couldn't attack his rear, Newcastle marched on Howley Hall, and after a short siege, Sir John of Lupset surrendered. It then served as Newcastle's base in the decisive Battle of Adwalton Moor (some to the northwest of Howley), which gave the Royalists control of Yorkshire for the remainder of the war. Although it is commonly believed locally that the Hall was destroyed during the 1643 siege, it actually sustained little damage, and was returned to the Savile family when Lord Sussex defected to the Parliamentarians. After falling from favour in 1646, he retired to Howley and made significant additions to the building. In 1661 it was inherited by his son James Savile. When James died without issue in 1671, the Hall passed into the hands of Brudenell family: Frances, James' sister and heir, was married to the son of Robert Brudenell, 2nd Earl of Cardigan. Its deterioration probably began at this time, as although the Brudenell family owned it for two and a half centuries, they apparently had no interest in living there. After James Savile's death in 1671, it was rented out to three tenant families, and by 1711 local people had begun reusing the stone in other buildings. Records show that some of the furnishings were sold to the Old Presbyterian Chapel in Bradford in 1719, and others are known to have ended up in the nearby Chief Bailiff's House (now Howley Hall Golf Club) and Thorpe Hall in Thorpe on the Hill. To save the Brudenell's the cost of maintenance, the buildings were finally demolished with gunpowder between 1717 and 1730, leaving the Hall in its current ruined state.

The central figure is Martin Luther, surrounded by both contemporary and historical Protestant reformers. Opposite him is a group of Catholics trying to blow the candle out. Often the first part of the text is pointing towards the bible, on which the light of the candle is shining, and the second part of the text is somewhat hidden under the puffs of breath coming from the Catholic objectors. Sometimes the candle is labelled \\"Evangelarium\\" or Gospels. Little is known of the origins of the text, but many assume the popularity of the scene in English means it was a 17th-century English invention. Luther with his bible translations and the other reformers through their questions regarding papal bulls and so forth have shed light on the bible, but they must protect it from the Catholics (the bull represents the papal bulls) who would wish to plunge it into darkness.

She was a disciple of the Sufi master Hamza al Qadiri al Boutchichi. Life Eva Lamacque de Vitray was born on 5 November 1909 in Boulogne-Billancourt, a rich Parisian suburb. From a privileged social background, she was educated in Catholic schools before studying for a law degree. She began a doctorate in philosophy on the subject of \\"Symbolism in Plato\\". At the age of 22 Eva married Lazare Meyerovitch, of Jewish Latvian origins. She became an administrator in the laboratory of Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie. In 1940 Eva escaped from Paris with Joliot-Curie in 1940 during the German occupation of [World War Two (1939-45)] and retired to the Corr√®ze department for the duration of the war. Eva's husband was a member of the Free French Forces. After the Liberation of France Eva joined the CNRS where she soon became director of the \\"Humanities\\" department. She also earned an income from translations. She met Louis Massignon, with whom she would remain closely linked and who supported her after the sudden death of her husband in the early 1950s. Eva discovered Islam through the book by the thinker and poet Muhammad Iqbal: Reconstruire la pens√©e religieuse de l'islam (Rebuilding the religious thought of Islam). After three years of Christian exegesis at the Sorbonne, she chose to become a Muslim. Eva was very interested in the work of the Persian poet Jal√¢l ud D√Æn R√ªm√Æ (1207‚Äì1273) who raised her awareness of the mystical aspect of Islam, Sufism. Subsequently, she embarked on learning Persian. Soon afterwards she published her first translations of Muhammad Iqbal and JalƒÅl ad-Dƒ´n Muhammad R≈´mƒ´. In 1968 Eva defended her doctoral dissertation at the University of Paris on Mystical Themes in the Work of Jalal Ud D√Æn R√ªm√Æ. From 1969 to 1973 she taught in Cairo at Al-Azhar University. In 1971 she made the pilgrimage to Mecca and also visited Medina. From 1972 until her death she regularly published annotated translations of R√ªmi's writings as well as works she wrote herself on Islam, Sufism and whirling dervishes. In 1990 she published her translation of R√ªmi's Masnavi, a colossal work of 50,000 verses in 1,700 pages, translated for the first time into French.Presentation of the publisher of the book. Parallel to her intellectual career, Eva pursued a personal quest that led her to meet many personalities involved in Sufism such as Amadou Hamp√¢t√© Ba, Najm Oud Din Bammate, Cheikh Bentoun√®s and Faouzi Skali. It was through the last that in Morocco, in 1985, she met a living Sufi spiritual guide, Hamza al Qadiri al Boutchichi, whose teaching she would follow until her death. She was also very active as a speaker in France and abroad to impart her knowledge of Jal√¢l ud D√Æn R√ªm√Æ, Islam and Sufism. She recorded several programs for France Culture and for television. In 1998, during her last conference in Turkey, she expressed the wish to be buried in Konya. Eva de Vitray-Meyerovitch died on 24 July 1999 in her apartment on rue Claude- Bernard in Paris. She was buried in a very private ceremony in Thiais, in the Paris region. From 2003 steps were taken to transfer her remains to Konya, which was done in 2008. On 17 November 2008, an official ceremony accompanied the burial of the coffin of Eva Vitray-Meyerovitch in Konya. Her grave is opposite the mausoleum of Jalal ud Din Rumi.

Marking the southern margins of Shillong Plateau (which is much steeper than the northern slope at about a height of 1500 m), the prominent East-West Dauki Fault System (5‚Äì6 km wide) is the most remarkable feature of the Plateau. This fault zone forms a sharp escarpment along the southern edge of the plateau. The steep escarpment indicates vertical displacement along the Dauki Fault Zone where the Bangladesh plains subside actively. Though the Dauki Fault Zone is shown as a single fault line on the geological map of Bangladesh (1990) but the images show that it is the combination of a number of en-echelon faults trending in different directions, making the fault scraps zigzag rather than a straight line. Spread between the block faulted Palaeogene sediments of the Northern Foreland Shelf and the block faulted Piedmont deposits of Plio-Pleistocene age of the Garo Hills, the Dauki Fault is a structural unit of considerable regional importance. The northeastern part of the Bengal Basin experiences strong seismicity believed to be caused by the Dauki Fault System.Fault, Banglapedia, Asiatic Society Bangladesh The Dauki Fault, according to Evans (1964) is a tear fault (transcurrent or strike slip fault) that trends transverse to the strike of the deformed rocks of the Mikir Hills Plateaus.P. Evans (1964) The Tectonic framework of Assam, Geological Society of India, vol. 5 pp.80‚Äì96 But Murthy et al. (1969) contradicted this proposition of Evans and argued with evidence that Dauki fault has a vertical uplift to the north, causing the Mikir Hills Plateaus as an uplifted region with northward tilting. These faults are similar to upthrusts.Murthy et al (1969), ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Dauki Fault of Assam‚Äô‚Äô, Oil and Natural Gas Commission Bulletin, vol 6 (2), pp 57‚Äì64 Seismic activity Judging by the geomorphic features of the Shillong Plateau, the gravity anomaly data, and uplifted Tertiary and Quaternary deposits on the southern foothills of the Shillong Plateau, Dauki Fault was long believed to be active during the Holocene period. It is assumed that the Dauki fault has ruptured three times in the past one thousand years. The Dauki fault might be divided into four rupture segments, the western, central, eastern, and easternmost segments. The eastern and western segments ruptured in AD 840‚Äì920 and in 1548, respectively. The 1897 earthquake might have been caused by the rupture of the central segment. A trench investigation conducted across the Dauki Fault at Gabrakhari Village, on the western part of the Dauki fault, inferred the timing of seismic events dating back to A.D. 1500‚Äì1630. The seismic event during A.D. 1500‚Äì1630 may correspond with the 1548 Bengal earthquake, the first recorded large earthquake of Bangladesh. Sand dikes, which reach near the ground surface due to paleo-liquefactions, were confirmed at the trench. These sand dikes formed during the Great Assam Earthquake of 12 June 1897 (Mw ‚©æ 8.0Yeats et al (1997), The geology of earthquakes, Oxford University Press, p. 568) caused by the rupture of the Dauki fault. Geological features Folding in soft sediments along the Dauki fault reveals the compression direction. Directional compressional tectonism has been expressed through lateral movements along the Dauki Fault as well as other faults and folds just south of the Haflong Thrust. It has been observed from the studies that the Dauki fault zone and the areas in Bangladesh show various tectonic features, which are mostly controlled by vertical movements. The occurrence of several deep earthquakes (> 100 km) indicate deep tectonic activities in the upper mantle.J.D.

The Hinge Zone is characterized by a series of step faults across its length. This Hinge Zone, characterized by a series of step faults across its length, is seismically active. The hypocentres of earthquake originating with this zone have depth ranges from 71 km to 150 km. The Zone is conventionally thought of as representing the dividing line between the Indian Platform with full thickness of continental crust and the Bengal Foredeep. In the south, north‚Äìsouth-trending axial surfaces of folds in Surma basin bend towards northeast while approaching the trace of Dauki fault, indicating dextral strike slip movement along the Dauki fault. This inference is further supported by the outcrop pattern of Haflong thrust in the footwall block with the concavity facing west. This thrust belonging to the BoS abruptly terminates against the younger Dauki fault. In the west, the hanging wall block of Dauki fault meets the non-folded, undeformed, near horizontal sedimentaries of Sylhet trough of Neogene. It is proposed that the Sylhet sediments were deposited in a pull-apart basin in the releasing bend of Dauki fault during the dextral strike slip movement. Thus the net slip for Dauki fault involves a vertical component and a dextral strike slip component (oblique-slip fault).V.

She was hanged for the murders of five children, two of whom were her own. Annice was owned by Jeremiah Prior of Clay County, Missouri. On July 27, 1828, she was indicted for the murders of five slave children also owned by Prior ‚Äì Ann, Billy, Nancy, Nelly, and Phebe. Billy (aged five) and Nancy (aged two) were Annice's own children, but the parentages and ages of the others were not identified. According to the indictment, she pushed the children \\"into a certain collection of water of the depth of five feet and there choaked [sic], suffocated and drowned, of which they instantly died\\".

One author has suggested that by killing the children Annice was \\"depriving her owner of no fewer than five potentially valuable properties\\", thus striking out against \\"the curse of involuntary servitude\\". Annice is the only slave known to have been executed for infanticide in Missouri, but a number of other instances have been found in other states. Enslaved women believed that by killing their children they were sparing them a lifetime of subjugation. There has been some speculation that Annice was the mother of another female slave of the same name, who was lynched in Clay County in 1850 for the attempted murder of her owner. However, there is no direct evidence linking the two other than their shared names and location.Frazier (2001), p. 255. In 1976, Clay County erected a memorial plaque at Tryst Falls (near Excelsior Springs), identifying it as the location of the drownings. The plaque was modified a few decades later to remove the specific details of Annice's actions. See also *Mary (slave), youngest person executed in Missouri *State of Missouri v.

Hotel and Casino Philadelphia is a planned casino in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, expected to open in 2020. It is planned to have 240 hotel rooms, 2,000 slot machines, and 125 table games. It is being developed by The Cordish Companies. Cordish also operates Xfinity Live! Philadelphia nearby. History The casino is planned to incorporate an existing Holiday Inn hotel in the city's stadium district. The hotel was built by a group led by Bankers Securities Corp. at a cost of $7 million, and opened in 1974 as the Philadelphia Hilton Inn. In 1976, local wine distributor Armand Ceritano acquired a controlling stake in the hotel, which had operated at a steep loss and was facing foreclosure. Ceritano put the hotel into bankruptcy the following year and was forced out. In 1985, it was acquired by Connecticut- based Colonial Real Estate. Colonial collapsed in the early 1990s, causing the hotel to go into bankruptcy again and lose its franchise agreement with Hilton, after which it was renamed as the Philadelphia Court Hotel. In 1993, it was purchased by an investment group led by former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Ron Jaworski, and became a Holiday Inn. In 2004, Pennsylvania legalized casinos, authorizing up to 14 gaming licenses to be issued statewide, with two of them allocated to stand-alone casinos to be built in Philadelphia. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board awarded those two licenses to SugarHouse Casino and Foxwoods Casino Philadelphia, but Foxwoods failed to obtain financing for its construction, and its license was revoked in 2010. The license remained in limbo for two years as Foxwoods unsuccessfully appealed the decision, and legislators then debated putting the license up for statewide bid. In July 2012, the Board opened a new round of applications for the second Philadelphia casino license. Cordish and Greenwood began evaluating sites shortly after the opening of the application process. In November 2012, they announced their proposal for a hotel-casino built around the Holiday Inn. It was one of six applications submitted to the Board. After two of the applicants withdrew, the Board selected the Cordish/Greenwood proposal as the best of the four remaining bids in November 2014. The Board's decision was appealed by the other three applicants and by the competing SugarHouse Casino, who charged that the Board did not properly consider all the factors required by law. The project also faced opposition from African-American community groups because of allegations of racial discrimination at other Cordish properties; those concerns were largely defused after Cordish signed a community benefits agreement promising that much of the casino's hiring and contracting would go to minorities. The project remained stalled in court for three years, because of claims that it would run afoul of a state law prohibiting any casino owner from owning more than a one-third interest in another casino within the state; Greenwood principal Bob Manoukian already owned a majority share of the Parx Casino, and he and his sons together would own a half interest in the Live! casino. The issue became moot in October 2017 when the state enacted a gaming expansion law that lifted the prohibition of multiple casino ownership. The lawsuit was promptly dropped, and Cordish stated that construction would begin in 2018, with completion planned for 2020. Cordish and Greenwood closed on their purchase of the site in January 2018 for $37 million. Some demolition work at the site was performed later that year. In November 2018, Cordish announced that it would buy out Greenwood's interests, taking full ownership of the project. They also stated that the hotel tower would be demolished instead of renovated; as the project had evolved, they had decided that the tower's position at the center of the site would conflict with plans for an expansive casino floor. On October 30, 2019, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board approved a sports betting license for the casino. Online sports betting is planned to be offered before the casino opens in 2020.

Although this type of warfare was already used in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Prussian Streifkorps used in the Liberation Wars are well known. The term Streifkorps, also Steifkorps or Streifenkorps or ≈†trafuni (): \\"... —É –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥—É –ø–æ –∑–ª—É –ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞—Ç–∏—Ö ¬ª–®—Ç—Ä–∞—Ñ—É–Ω–∞¬´, ...\\" was later used to denote special counterinsurgency units in Austria-Hungarian controlled Bosnia and Herzegovina, composed of Muslims.: \\"Muslims were also drafted into special counterinsurgency units known as the Steifkorps.\\": \\"Muslimani so sestavljali tudi posebne protigverilske enote, ¬ªSteifkorps¬´.\\" They were established to fight against guerrilla rebels using search and destroy tactics. Among the population of the region where they were active, Streifkorps were hated and had a very bad reputation.: \\"... —É –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥—É –ø–æ –∑–ª—É –ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞—Ç–∏—Ö ¬ª–®—Ç—Ä–∞—Ñ—É–Ω–∞¬´, ...\\"  Streifkorps in the Napoleonic Period The Streifkorps were recruited from volunteer companies, attached to infantry and cavalry regiments; they comprised cavalry, infantry and sometimes artillery units, ranging in size from 100-150 men to several thousand. They operated as part of a Division or Corps, scouting the area and disrupting the enemy's movements. An example of such a Streifkorps was that of Major Friedrich August Peter von Colomb (born 19 June 1775 in Aurich, - died 12 November 1854 in Kalinigrad. Given the choice to form a squadron of voluntary J√§gers, he was assigned one officer and four NCO's from his Hussar Regiment, of which 10 hussars volunteered. He recruited his squadron from Neumark, all volunteers having to provide their own uniforms and equipment. It operated from April until June 1813, when, after a successful operation in which the Korps had among others captured an artillery park of 18 guns, six howitzers and all equipment, and 700 horses, Von Colomb and his command was destroyed in an ambush. Von Colomb and 14 others escaped, being awarded the Iron Cross, and given the command of a new Streifkorps in November, which consisted of infantry and cavalry. As part of the Prussian III Corps under Von B√ºlow, he operated behind enemy lines in Flanders and Holland. Von Colomb is said to have brought \\"the Spanish Guerilla to Germany\\". Other famous Streifkorps were the \\"Black Horde\\" of the Duke of Brunswick and the \\"L√ºtzower Freikorps\\", which comprised infantry, cavalry and artillery, and was several thousand men strong. The Brunswick Corps was recruited by the Duke of Brunswick and at first clothed, armed and equipped by Austria. After being defeated by French troops and having to flee Germany, they escaped with the help of the Royal Navy and were from then on paid and equipped by Britain. The Corps fought successfully in Spain and later at Waterloo. The L√ºtzower Freikorps consisted of volunteers from all over Germany, appealing to the idea of a unified Germany. It fought successfully during the Liberation War in 1813-1814, and was afterwards incorporated into the Prussian army. The regiments formed from the Korps also fought at Waterloo. The black uniform with red trimmings and gold buttons would be the inspiration for the German flag.  Establishment during the Herzegovina Uprising in 1882  The Streifkorps were established to fight against guerrilla rebels using search and destroy tactics. Among the population of the region where they were active, Streifkorps were hated and had a very bad reputation.: \\"... —É –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥—É –ø–æ –∑–ª—É –ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞—Ç–∏—Ö ¬ª–®—Ç—Ä–∞—Ñ—É–Ω–∞¬´, ...\\" They were established at the end of 1882, in the border region toward Montenegro, Sand≈æak and Serbia. It was organised as soon as the Herzegovina 1882 Uprising reached serious dimensions. The proposal to establish Streifkorps came from the governor of Mostar in September 1882. After the defeat of the uprising in 1881/82, the Streifkorps were engaged as mobile surveillance force until 1888 when their number was first reduced. In 1891 they were completely dissolved, with the assigned soldiers returning to their regiments or to the Bosnian- Herzegovinian gendarmerie corps.:\\"Die ¬ªStrafuni¬´ wurden nach Niederwerfung des Aufstandes 1881/82 zun√§chst beibehalten, im Jahre 1888 reduziert und 1891 vollst√§ndig aufgel√∂st, wobei die eingeteilten Soldaten zu ihren Regimentern und die Gendarmen in das .\\"  Equipment  The Streifkorps carried only personal arms and small amount of equipment in their backpack, while reserves of ammunition and equipment were strategically placed in guarded secret places in the wilderness. They were the first military units in the world to carry backpacks.

At the beginning of the Battle of Cer, units of Streifkorps crossed the Drina together with other units of Austria-Hungary and invaded Serbia. They participated in the looting of Belgrade and imprisoning its population when Austria-Hungary captured it in 1915.

Known locally as the \\"Mother Teresa of Baltimore,\\" she was inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame in 2006.  Early life and education  Beatrice Frankie Fowler was born in Wake Forest, North Carolina, in 1933. She grew up in poverty, in a violent home. By the age of 25, she had been divorced twice and was the mother of five children, occasionally living on welfare. She and her children moved to New York City, where she worked for several years as a housekeeper. In 1964, the family moved to Baltimore. While working and raising a family, Gaddy enrolled in mental health courses at Catonsville Community College. She went on to earn a bachelor's degree in human services from Antioch University in 1977.  Career  Gaddy joined the staff of the East Baltimore Children's Fund in the early 1970s, offering the use of her home as a distribution center for food and clothing for the poor. In 1981 she founded the Patterson Park Emergency Food Center, personally collecting food donations from local churches in a shopping cart and distributing them to needy neighbors. That same year, she won $250 in the Maryland State Lottery and used it to serve about 40 of her neighbors a Thanksgiving Day dinner. Since then, the Bea Gaddy's Thanks for Giving Campaign has become an annual tradition in Baltimore, with hundreds of volunteers serving 3,000 meals on site and delivering 50,000 more to those who cannot travel. Gaddy's food center also collected and distributed toys to children at Christmas, and hundreds of pairs of shoes each winter. In the 1990s she started a furniture bank and a program to renovate abandoned row houses for needy families. She became a minister so that she could perform marriages and burial ceremonies for the poor, free of charge. She was also involved in voter education and summer youth programs, and served as assistant chairperson in the Johns Hopkins Day Program. She was elected to the Baltimore City Council in 1999.  Awards and honors  Gaddy received many awards and honors for her service to the community, including the Unsung Hero Award (1972), Afro American Woman of the Year (1984), Baltimore's Best Award (1984), the National Council of Negro Women Humanitarian Award (1988), Mayor's Citation (1988), and the Baltimore City Council Award (1987 and 1989). In 1992, President George H. W. Bush named Gaddy one of his \\"Thousand Points of Light,\\" and The Baltimore Sun named her Marylander of the Year. She received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Towson State University in 1993, and the Frederick Douglass Award from the University System of Maryland Board of Regents in 2000.  Death and legacy  Gaddy was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998. She died on October 3, 2001, aged 68.

Early life She was born Patricia Clare Fell- Clark on 23 September 1914, at 68 Fitzjohns Avenue, Hampstead, in north London, the youngest of four children of Robert Fell-Clark (1872‚Äì1948), a paint businessman, and his wife, Hannah Clare Fell-Clark, n√©e Williams (1877‚Äì1965). She was educated at Frognal School, Prior's Field School, and a Paris finishing school, followed by Heatherley School of Fine Art, London. Career In 1939, at the age of 25, and already enjoying some success as a portrait painter, she was walking along London's Oxford Street when she saw Ayana Deva Angadi (1903‚Äì1993), an aspiring Indian writer and Trotskyist intellectual. She said to a friend: \\"He's gorgeous. I would really love to paint him.\\" A few weeks later, they met by chance at a political rally, and a relationship developed. On 1 May 1943 at Kensington Register Office, they married, and although her parents refused to attend, her governess \\"Portie\\" did. The couple were allowed to live on the top floor of her parents' house in Hampstead. The Angadis established the Asian Music Circle, and introduced eastern culture to the UK, including yoga, Indian dancing and music, all quite novel at the time. Their visitors included Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar. In 1953, Angadi became chair of the Hampstead Artists Council. She continued to paint, including portraits of Yehudi Menuhin and her friends Barbara Castle and Fenner Brockway. In 1965, the Angadis attended a recording session for the Beatles' song \\"Norwegian Wood\\", where Patricia sketched John Lennon and George Harrison at work. The following year, she painted a wedding portrait of Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd, and introduced Harrison, and by extension the Beatles, to Ravi Shankar. In the 1970s, she was a teacher at Highgate Primary School, in London. After the suicide of her youngest son Darien in 1981, she found a new direction, and published seven novels, The Governess (1985), which critics compared to the novels of Mary Wesley, followed by The Done Thing (1987), The Highly Flavoured Ladies (1988), Sins Of The Mothers (1989), Playing For Real (1990), Turning The Turtle (1991) and My Mother Said (1992). Personal life The couple \\"separated amicably\\" in 1970, and her husband returned to India, and she lived in a house in Hampstead's Flask Walk. Their youngest son Darien Angadi (1949‚Äì1981) was a singer and actor, and killed himself in 1981. Later life On 26 June 2001, she died at London's Royal Free Hospital, following a stroke. She was survived by three of her four children, Daniel (born 1944), Dominic (born 1946), and Chandrika (born 1953).

Location  The village lies south of the town of Bad M√ºnstereifel. The Landesstra√üe 497 runs through it. On the edge of the village is the stream of Houverather Bach, which merges with the Winkelbach and later, as the Sahrbach, empties into the River Ahr.  History  Houverath is first recorded in 1190. At that time Houverath had already been in the possession of the counts of Vianden for 200 years. Territorial sovereignty changed, a good 200 years later, to the counts of Blankenheim. They had to step down in 1794 following the invasion of the French into the Rhineland. At that time the villages of Limbach and Houverath formed a single juridical district. On 1 July 1969, the hitherto independent municipality of Houverath was incorporated into Bad M√ºnstereifel.  Transport  The Linientaxis (\\"line taxis\\") of routes 828 and 802 of the Cologne's RVK regional transport network run through the village.  Facilities  There is a Catholic primary school and a two-group kindergarten, run by the town. Local clubs have a sports and multi-purpose hall. The parish church is dedicated to St. Thomas. There are 15 graves in the war cemetery. One sight is the protected old St. Thomas Church which, until the consecration of the new one in 1913 was the parish church. There is a carnival club with three guards.

It has a single tubular, green leaf and up to thirty five greenish-white flowers with a pinkish labellum. It is only known from a population of fewer than twenty plants growing in a sanctuary near Port Sorell. Description Prasophyllum limnetes is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf which is long and wide near its purplish base. The free part of the leaf is long. Between fifteen and thirty five greenish-white flowers are crowded along a flowering spike which is long, reaching to a height of . As with other leek orchids, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide and the lateral sepals are long, about wide, erect and free from each other. The petals are long, about wide and turn forwards. The labellum is greenish white with pink or mauve tinges, tapers to a point and turns sharply upwards near its middle. The edges of the upturned part of the labellum are slightly wavy and there is a callus in its centre, extending to its tip. Flowering occurs from late November to December. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum limnetes was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones from a specimen collected in marshland near Port Sorell and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (limnetes) is a Latin word meaning \\"marsh-dweller\\". Distribution and habitat The marsh leek orchid grows in the ecotone between marshland and woodland in the Rubicon Sanctuary near Port Sorell. Conservation Prasophyllum limnetes is listed as \\"Critically Endangered\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act and the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. It is only known from a single population of up to 20 plants inhabiting a range of a few square metres. The main threats to the population are land clearing, habitat fragmentation and inappropriate burning.

Able to speak several languages she taught children and novice sisters throughout Gabon. She rose to become a mother superior and head of the Congregation of the Sisters of St Marie of Gabon.  Life  Cecilia Fatou-Berre was born 5 July 1901 in Libreville, French Congo - one of 15 children. Her father was a Mpongwe trader and her mother was from southern Cameroon. Fatou-Berre was educated at a catholic school run by the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception from 1909 to 1918. She expressed an interest in becoming a nun as early as 1910 and received a scholarship to a boarding school. However, whilst her mother accepted her chosen occupation her father opposed it as he had hoped she would marry and support him. Fatou-Berre left her family, escaping by boat with a French priest to the mission station at Donguila on 4 February 1918. She learnt to speak the Fang language, the only language spoken in Donguila parish. Fatou-Berre took her vows as a religious sister on 28 January 1923. Fatou-Berre went to Franceville in the south-east of Gabon, a journey that took her two months of overland travel. Here she farmed to provide food for the mission and taught the Ndumu, Obamba and Teke languages and catechism to girls. Fatou-Berre was responsible for ensuring the mission had enough food through the famines of the 1920s and 30s. In 1929 she was made mother superior and made many conversions to Catholicism during the Great Depression. Fatou-Berre returned to her home town for the first time in 1941 before she became director of the novitiate of St Marie of Gabon at the mission station in Sindara. She wrote sermons in local languages and her students were sent to missions throughout the country, including Fernan Vaz Lagoon where Fatou-Berre was key in replacing South American and European sisters with Gabonese. Fatou-Berre remained at Sindara until 1950, when she went to Zanaga in modern-day Republic of the Congo and then to Minvoul, Gabon. At one point she was the first Gabonese sister to work in the Parish of St Andrew in Libreville, a fact remembered by a catholic community that was named after her. Fatou-Berre was made head of the Congregation of the Sisters of St Marie of Gabon in 1955 and held that position until 1967. She died, after a slow decline in her health, on 2 November 1989.

Its founder was Willy von Roy. The first issue was printed on February 26, 1899. In 1902 the edition was 1000 copies.  History  In 1907, German settlers in Tanga in the Usambara Post attacked the colonial policy of Governor Albrecht von Rechenberg. The latter then instructed his officials not to support the newspaper published in the state German school of Tanga sheet, after which the newspaper was set. Willy von Roy declared his solidarity with the settlers and let print the Usaramo post office for three months for the vacant market. Albrecht von Rechenberg, who wanted to promote African agriculture and a Euro-Indian merchant class, rejected an intensification of immigration from Europe and a promotion of German agriculture in East Africa. He showed little sympathy for German Colonial Society, but was open to African cultures, including languages. In contrast, the Deutsch-Ostafrikanische Zeitung represented the position of the German-born settlers. A popular topic of the Deutsch-Ostafrikanische Zeitung was the confrontation with the northern neighbors, the Maasai. The newspaper quoted affirmatively Bishop Jean-Joseph Hirth (1854-1931) from Ukara, according to which the peace in the country could not be restored until the last Maasai was exterminated. The German-East African government had the German-East African Rundschau relocated to promote government policy. The first issue appeared on August 22, 1908, but was not bought by the German settlers. The government withdrew the 250 German government subscriptions from the Deutsch-Ostafrikanische Zeitung, did not print any more official advertisements, and took the concession to print the Official Gazette of German East Africa as well as Der Pflanzer. Von Roy then published printed matter with similar-sounding names: Official Advertisements for German East Africa and The German East African Planter (first edition June 19, 1909). Passavant, a journalist of the German East African Rundschau, researched that in 1899 a punishment had been imposed on Roy in a Bagatellsache. As a result, the German East African Newspaper reported that von Rechenberg had a homosexual relationship with one of his servants.The Rechenberg Scandal and Homosexuality in German East Africa Roy was sentenced in November 1910 by a court for [halitosis] to half a year in custody and deportation to the German Reich. Wilhelm II lifted the prison sentence, but not the expulsion from German East Africa. Von Roy appointed Alfred Zintgraff as publisher for the Deutsch-Ostafrikanische Zeitung in 1911. Zintgraff founded the Deutsch-Ostafrikanische Zeitungs G.m.b.H. Zintgraff Wilhelm F√∂llmer, chairman of the German Colonial Association, made the chairman of the supervisory board.

Plot  Teenager Nathan and his single father St√©phane drive cross-town to their new apartment, due to Nathan's transferral to another school mid-term. Nathan's dad is a policeman and does not want a gay son. Their once close relationship grows cold and distant after St√©phane learns Nathan is gay. After Nathan is bullied and assaulted, St√©phane realizes he was wrong and begins to support his son. Nathan is insecure and expresses concern about his openness with his homosexuality and past gay relationships. His father encourages him to be himself and not care what people say. At a school party, Nathan kisses a boy, Louis, after meeting up in secret, but someone manages to take a picture of them and shares it. The news spreads quickly among the other students and soon the entire school is aware and bullies Nathan. None of the students realize the other boy is Louis in the photo because of the angle the photo was taken and it being dark. Tristan, an English teacher at the school, notices Nathan being bullied and pleads with his Math teacher who is a closeted lesbian, Catherine, to offer him advice, but she refuses. Nathan then meets up once again with Louis. Although Nathan wants them to be together, Louis rejects him and expresses regret. Louis claims he‚Äôs not gay. He angrily leaves and heads home, where he spends time tanning in the pool with his girlfriend, Laura. In P.E. class, Nathan gets beaten up in front of Louis. Rather than helping Nathan, Louis attacks him as well. Louis and Laura later discuss Nathan while laying together, only for Laura to reveal that she was the one who took the picture, wanting to invoke a reaction in her boyfriend. Louis denies being gay and accuses Nathan of pushing him into doing this. During a Math lesson, Catherine notices Nathan's wounds and demands to learn what happened. She then tells a story about a girl who preferred other girls and was bullied for it. At the end of the school day, Catherine is picked up by her girlfriend and the two kiss in front of the students. This inspires Nathan to stand up to his bullies and kiss Louis in front of everyone as well, but gets bitterly rejected once again. Louis' mother, Corinne, uses her son's laptop after having hardware issues but discovers he watches gay pornography. She and her husband Bruno punish Louis when he comes back by taking away his phone and computer and refuse to let him go to school for the next few days. Meanwhile, Catherine and Tristan plead with the principal to protect Nathan and every LGBT student at the school, but to no avail. A few days later, Louis apologizes to his parents and promises that he isn't gay. When they decide to give his phone back, they discover he is once again lying to them and decide to ignore him from now on. Louis runs away and meets up with Laura, who learns why he hasn't been responding to her texts. She runs away heartbroken after Louis only asks her for money, wanting to leave his house and parents forever. However, Laura tells Nathan and he along with his father go on a search for Louis, who is now contemplating suicide on a rooftop. They find and rescue him and the two reunited teenagers embrace. At St√©phane's apartment, Louis stays up late at night but falls asleep when Nathan invites him to lay together. The next day St√©phane calls Louis' parents and his father comes to pick him up. St√©phane tries to talk with Louis' father about what happened, but he becomes agitated and demands for Louis to come to him immediately. Louis and his father leave after Louis reassures Nathan that he will be alright. When Louis arrives home his father locks him in his room. He tells his wife she has to trust him; however she seems unsure about the way they are treating Louis. After discovering a set of photos of Louis and his little brother she decides to break open Louis' door. She apologizes for locking him up and leaves with Louis and her youngest son. Louis' mother enters his father's clinic and waits to see him. When he exits his office she tells him they need to speak immediately. She tells him he can't keep punishing Louis because of who he is; however, his father gets angry and says he was only protecting Louis, because he cares for him. He says Louis tried to commit suicide because he is gay. She corrects him by saying he did it because they didn't accept Louis and thought he was abnormal. She continues by saying they are the ones that need to change, not Louis. She tells him she doesn't know who her husband is anymore and is leaving him. Louis, his brother and mother move into a new house. However, he has to transfer schools to be closer to home. Louis remains in contact with Laura and reassures her they will see each other at his next boxing match. Soon after, Nathan and Laura go to the train station together to pick Louis up for his upcoming boxing match. Nathan apologizes to Laura for the kiss. She reassures him she is not angry with them. Louis arrives and shares a kiss with Nathan. A passerby comments on their kiss but Laura tells them how beautiful the boys are together. Everyone is present at Louis' boxing match, except for his father. Louis decides at the last moment he doesn't want to participate. St√©phane talks to him, asking him if he only likes boxing because of his father or because he actually likes it himself. Whatever the answer, if he quits it must be with no regrets. Louis decides he will box. The first round goes poorly with Louis' opponent winning. His father then shows up. Seeing him gives Louis the encouragement to beat his opponent; however, Louis' father leaves before the match is over. After the match Louis sprints to his father's car. He tells him his progress is because of his father. And asks him to stay and celebrate with the rest of his friends. He asks him if he is proud. His father remains silent the whole time. He drives off before saying anything, leaving an upset Louis behind. St√©phane finds Louis and comforts him saying his father needs some more time. He tells him everyone is waiting for him to celebrate.

He was born at Southampton in Hampshire and died at St John's Wood, London. Du Cane was the fourth son of a Royal Navy officer and part of the Du Cane family that owned Braxted Park in Essex. His older brother was Charles du Cane, a politician and colonial administrator who also played first-class cricket. Du Cane was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. There are no records that show that he played cricket at Harrow, but at Cambridge University he appeared in several matches in both the 1854 and 1855 seasons, played principally on account of his bowling; it is not known whether he was right- or left-handed at either batting or bowling, nor what style of bowling he practised. After a single first-class match for Cambridge against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), he was picked for a \\"Gentlemen of the MCC\\" side against the \\"Gentlemen of England\\" and took 10 wickets in the match, although the full bowling figures for this game do not survive. He was then picked for Cambridge side in the 1854 University Match against Oxford University, where he took three wickets, although Oxford won the game by an innings. After the University Match, he played a single game for the Gentlemen of England side, and in 1855, in addition to playing again for Cambridge University ‚Äì including a second appearance in the University Match ‚Äì he also turned out for MCC and for the Gentlemen of England, though he did not improve on his bowling performance from his second game. He did not play any further first-class cricket after the 1855 season. Du Cane graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1857; this converted to a Master of Arts in 1860. He was ordained as a Church of England deacon in 1858 and as a priest the following year, and then served in parishes in Staffordshire, Cheshire, Sussex and Warwickshire before becoming vicar of Willingale Doe, Essex from 1874 to his death in 1882 at the age of 47.

Early life Harris was born to a poor Negro family in the southern city of Augusta, along Georgia's Savannah River, on October 7, 1871. At the end of the American Civil War in 1865, her parents, Sarah Green and Richard Matthews, left the Phinizy plantation to seek a better life and opportunities in the city. Green worked as a washerwoman, scrubbing clothes for the local white families, while Matthews labored daily in one of the city's numerous cotton processing mills. After Harris was born, two more children followed (Thomas, in 1873, and Josephine, in 1880). By 1880, the family had settled in an old brick tenement on 319 Houston Street. Soon after, Harris began attending Edmund Asa Ware High School, the first public high school for African-Americans in Georgia. That summer, Harris was sent to Norfolk, Virginia to live with her widowed Aunt Hattie Matthews to continue her studies and later attend the Negro Mission College, which opened in 1883. But a few years later, her aunt died, leaving the young Harris stranded in Virginia with no place to go. Instead of returning home, in 1892, Harris made her way to New York and found work as a chambermaid. On December 23, 1896, Harris met and married local janitor Joseph B. Harris. The couple settled into a small apartment in Brooklyn, where they hoped to start a family. She also assisted in bringing several of her relatives up from the South. After the sudden death of their only child, Harris began focusing on her singing career. Due to her staunchly religious parents' disapproval of her career as an entertainer, Harris began singing in the Trinity Baptist Church Choir and working as a domestic for nearly five years. Louisiana Amazon Guards (1901‚Äì1904) Around April 3, 1901, while riding a trolley to work, Harris noticed that someone had left a copy of the New York Herald beside her. She saw an advertisement posted by German theatrical impresario Paula Kohn- W√∂llner, seeking seven Negro women with the ability to sing and dance for a concert tour of Germany. Harris replied to the advert and was promptly accepted. Kohn-W√∂llner, who had previously managed two theatrical troupes in the 1890s in Leipzig and Chemnitz, had made a trip to New York to visit her two married sisters, when she got the idea to organize a Negro theatrical troupe to tour across Europe. Soon the troupe consisted of Olga Burgoyne (a 26-year-old singer from the Oriental America show), Fannie Wise (a 19-year-old singer from Brooklyn), Florence Collins (a 26-year-old pianist from Kentucky), Alverta Burley (a 19-year-old from Baltimore), S.T. Jubrey (a 32-year-old housewife from Virginia) and Harris. Another girl, 20-year-old Corette Hardy, was also accepted, but it was decided that she was to be left behind as a replacement in case any of the women decided to quit the newly christened \\"Louisiana Amazon Guard\\" troupe. On April 10, the six women were brought to the Passport Office to apply for their first passports. After two weeks with Ms. Kohn-W√∂llner paying for all six of the women's travel expenses, they boarded on the S.S. Deutschland, heading for Germany. By April 21, the troupe had arrived in Leipzig, Germany. Throughout June and July, the troupe made a series of successful performances at Kaiserkrone and Carlsbad's Hotel Weber in Kiel. In late August, the women intrigued Hungarian audiences at the Os- Budavara fortress. In September, the women fulfilled a month-long engagement at Vienna's Colosseum Theater. The following month was spent at Copenhagen's Cirkus Variete for the beginning of their brief Scandinavian tour. In November, the troupe spent two successful weeks at Goteborg's Circus Madigan and two more weeks at Stockholm's Svensalen Variety Restaurant. Between their performances, on November 11, Ms. Kohn-W√∂llner conducted several interviews with the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper, frequently pushing forward Wise (dressed in a black and white dress). Ms. Kohn-W√∂llner mentioned her plans to organize a band for the troupe, the contract she signed with the Folies-Bergere (for January 1902) and to bring over Hardy, who was still waiting in America. The troupe returned to Germany in December to entertain at Berlin's Circus Schumann where they ended the year, preparing for another year of extensive touring. The new year of 1902, the group opened in Magdeburg for a two-week engagement before moving on to France, where the women intended to perform at Paris' famous Folie-Bergere cabaret. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem as if that ever came into fruition and the troupe returned to Germany to appear in Braunswich's Bruning Theater and Halle's Walhalla Theater. The month of March was spent in Breslau's Liebich Etablissement, followed by performances at Danzig's Wilhelm Theater and Poznan's Kaisergarten in April. In May, the group disappears briefly from the limelight as Fannie Wise and S.T. Jubrey suddenly quit the group and returned home to the United States. During this time their replacements, standby performers, Corette Hardy and Fannie Smith (20-year-old from Philadelphia) were promptly brought over to Europe. Throughout June, the troupe toured across Switzerland, performing in Zurich and St. Gallen before returning north to Germany. The month of July was spent at Munich's Deutsches Theater, followed by a month at Leipzig's Central Theater (September) and Dresden (October). After twenty-one months of touring across Europe, during their Dresden engagement, the entire troupe walked out on their German impresario. Kohn-W√∂llner was taken to court and accused of exploiting them financially. Lead performer Ollie Burgoyne was elected as their new manager and, now as the \\"Five Louisianas\\", the women left for Berlin, where they entertained at the Orpheum Theater and Harmonie Circus. After a brief engagement in Trier and Aachen, the group suddenly disappeared. In March 1903, Ollie Burgoyne and Florence Collins renewed their American passports and departed for London to join the cast of Hurtig & Seamon's \\"In Dahomey\\", which opened on March 16 at the Shaftesbury Theatre. The four remaining women, continued performing around Germany for the next three months before departing for the Russian Empire. After receiving a passport from Berlin's American Embassy (July 10th, 1903), the troupe traveled northwest to Saint Petersburg, to appear for two months at the popular Krestovskiy Garden Amusement Park, where they opened on July 19th. On September 29th, the troupe opened in Moscow at Aumont's French Theater for a another two months billed as the \\"4 Ebony Belles\\". The focal point of Moscow's lively nightlife, located just west of Triumphal Square, the Aumont Theater was an entertainment garden occupying several park-like acres that was a relief from the more genteel and prosperous classes of society, who weren't put off by the frivolous nature of the establishment's entertainment. That evening, as the crowds made their way from the theater towards the open-air caf√© chantant, the troupe joined twenty variety acts onstage varying from trained animals and acrobats to operatic singers. The theater director, Charles Aumont, was a successful yet ruthless French-Algerian businessman that renovated the gardens in 1898 to make visitors feel like they had visited a magical world. He was well known for exploiting chorus girls and female performers to allure the largely male audience. After their turn onstage, the head Ma√Ætre d‚Äô (an African-American man named, Frederick Bruce Thomas), informed the women that as singers, they would be called upon after their performance to entertain the private parties. During the winter of 1903, the Louisiana Amazon Guard (Ebony Belles) finally dissolved. Alverta Burley married African-American entertainer, Oliver E. Brodie and the couple toured as \\"Brodie & Brodie\\". Harris convinced Corett√© Hardy and Fannie Smith to remain in Russia with her and they formed the \\"Harris Trio\\". For the next six months, the trio performed between Saint- Petersburg and Moscow. In March 1904, the duo became the \\"Harris Trio\\" with the addition of Fannie Smith, and together they departed for Helsinki with an engagement at the illustrious Hotell Fennia, where Finnish high society enjoyed to mingle. During the summer of 1904, the Harris Trio, together with Ollie Bourgoyne and Jennie Scheper (from the Florida Creole Girls) formed a new company known as the \\"Creole Troupe\\" and continued touring the principal Russian cities. On January 22, 1905, while attending a party, hosted by popular American jockey, William Caton, in central Saint-Petersburg, the women witnessed the Bloody Sunday riots outside the Tsar's palace and across the city. The trio immediately packed up and returned to Moscow, where they resumed working at the Aumont Theater. In February, while performing in the city of Vyatka, the trio decided to dissolve and Corette and Fannie departed for Poland. The Black Nightingale (1905‚Äì1913) Now as a solo artist, Harris returned to Helsinki in March 1905, performing for two weeks at the popular Princess Restaurant followed by two more weeks in the Finnish city of Tampere at the Seurahuoneen Sali. Shortly afterwards, she returned to St. Petersburg and Moscow, where she met a handsome, English-speaking scientist and museum curator named Baranov; soon afterwards the two became lovers. Despite the revolution raging across the Russian Empire, Harris embarked on an extended Siberian tour that coincided with Baranov's own personal lecture tour across Russia's expansive Volga region. Baranov accompanied her everywhere acting as her manager and promised to accompany her on a trip to the United States the following year. Since trains hardly reached many parts of Russia, much of the journey was made using troikas and were often followed by hungry wolves. Harris later discovered that her Grand Duke was a charlatan. Baranov had been presenting her onstage as a singing African savage, manipulating and stealing her money after the show. Eventually, the couple arrived in the city Kazan. Located on the left bank of the Volga and Kazanka River and 520 miles east of Moscow, the former capital of the ancient Qazan Khanate was ravaged annually by many winters and summers; it was also modern compared to the numerous Germanic villages and towns that lined the Volga. As the educational and cultural center of Russia's vast Volga region, the city featured electric lighting, electric trams, telegraphs, telephones and the Kazan Imperial University. Desperate to escape, Harris attempted to flee from her abusive lover only to be seized by several Tsarist gendarmes who took her to jail. As the Russo-Japanese conflict was still raging, Baranov reported Harris to the authorities as a spy for the Japanese that was traversing across Russia under the guise of a performer. Eventually, an intervention from Moscow's American consulate allowed her to be released. On September 2, the Russo-Japanese War ended, as the Russian Empire was forced to surrender to the Japanese. Scraping enough money by teaching English around Kazan, Harris boarded a train to Moscow, where she sought out Samuel Smith, who orchestrated her release from prison. The racist Smith was shocked to discover that he had aided a Negro woman from prison. Realizing she couldn't count on America for further help, Harris decided to scrap her plans to return the United States the following year and remain in Russia. Early in 1906, a Baltimore businessman, Harry Leans, visited Russia and offered to fund Harris's first solo tour across the Russian Empire. Harris decided to keep the African persona that Baranov had created for her, becoming \\"Galima Oriedo: The Black Nightingale\\". She performed songs in German, French, Polish, and Russian. Her specialty was Russian romance songs, which were extremely popular in all of the major cabarets and theaters across the empire. In between her songs, Harris demonstrated her ability to play the flute and ocarina, as well as her ability to imitate the sounds with her voice. She quickly became a popular operatic singer and classical dancer in Moscow and St. Petersburg. During the course of her tour, Harris learned that her husband had died back in Brooklyn. Around 1907 to 1908, Harris returned and became a popular fixture in Moscow, performing with popular African-American entertainer Edgar H. Jones. He had been touring around Europe for 17 years, having arrived in 1891 with the \\"Afro-American Specialty Company\\". In 1904, as his European career began to falter, Edgar began frequently appearing across the Russian Empire, spending little time home in Berlin, where his wife Amelia Jones and four children lived at Kleine Hamburgerstrasse 2. 1908 was full of success for nearly every African-American expatriate across the Russian Empire. In St. Petersburg, the former leader of the old Louisiana Amazon Guards, Ollie Burgoyne, was a popular headliner, as mistress to a Russian noble named Sasha who provided her with a mansion on the outskirts of the capital. Corette Alefred had married a Russian theater director and become Coretti de-Utina, a popular concert singer. In Moscow, Pearl Hobson, from the Florida Creole Girls, was a popular headliner at the illustrious Yar Restaurant. Also backstage at the Yar was waiter Frederick Bruce Thomas, back in Moscow following the revolution and employed at the restaurant as the new artistic director and Miss Hobson's manager. During the summer of 1910, Harris appeared in the exotic city of Constantinople, as a start to a lengthy Turkish tour. The city reminded Harris of Moscow's oriental nature. She became such a sought-after entertainer that she was invited to Yildƒ±z Sarayƒ±, the abandoned palace of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, to perform at the Imperial Seraglio. Performing at all the popular hotels and music halls, she mastered the exotic belly dances, known as Raqs Sharqi, which she soon showcased every night. She eventually became so popular that she was even invited to perform for the 12-year-old Shah of Persia, Ahmad Shah Qajar and his elderly uncle, Ali Reza Khan Azod al-Molk, who later died that September. In January 1911, Harris returned from the Ottoman Empire for the beginning of a lengthy tour across the Caucasus Viceroyalty. In the Georgian city of Tiflis (now Tbilisi) she debuted at the Modern Theater. The following month, she was engaged at the Illusion Theater alongside a popular African boxer named Bomburo. During the summer of 1911, while in Tbilisi, Harris met a 28-year-old Russian peasant, Alexander Ivanovich Mizikin. Not long after meeting, Mizikin became Harris's manager and soon also her husband. Soon, Harris Russified her name, becoming Emma Richardsovna Mizikina (–≠–º–º—ã –†–∏—á–∞—Ä–¥–æ–≤–Ω–∞ –ú–∏–∑–∏–∫–∏–Ω–∞). Under the management of Mizikin, Harris's public and stage persona developed away from an American vaudeville dancer into an exotic North-African dancer. On January 6, 1912, billed as the famous Algerian Arab performer, Harris appeared in Rostov-on-Don for a two-week engagement at the Pel-Mel Cabaret (within the Maly Theater). By the spring, she was engaged in the Belarussian city of Braslav on April 15, demonstrating her musical abilities and exotic dances at the Theater Uvarova. That summer, the couple returned south to Ukraine, where they established a residence in Kharkov, the quiet provincial merchant city of 250,000 before a lucrative engagement at Odessa's North Hotel. The Kharkov Governorate, with a population of two million, was filled with various small cities and villages where the Russian merchants and peasantry conversed in Ukrainian, Russian, German, Yiddish, Belarussian, Polish and Tatar. The Kharkov county, which housed the Governorate capital of Kharkov, had a population of over 500,000. The Mizikin household settled in an apartment at 41 Edinovercheskaya Street, located in southern Kharkov's rough Moskalevska District. The district was modest compared to the rest of Kharkov: unpaved streets and alleys, 10 factories, 20 bars, numerous mudbrick houses and a few stone buildings scattered across the neighborhood. Despite residing in a working-class area, Harris strived to immerse herself into the aristocratic lifestyle that she'd witnessed across the Russian Empire, employing six servants and footmen. In August, she was visited by her old acquaintance, 49-year old Negro comedian Edgar Jones, who was in the middle of one of his Ukrainian tours. After a brief visit, Edgar departed for the city of Lebedin (now Lebedyn) for a performance. On August 29, he died of heart paralysis and was buried in the Troitskaya Cemetery. Harris aided the governor of Kharkov and Odessa's American consulate in burying Jones and sending his possessions of clothing and musical instruments to his family in Germany. The following month, as anti-government protests raged across Russia, a double agent shot and killed Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin while he attended a performance at the Kiev Opera House; the Tsar heard the shots himself. The Romanov Tercentenary began in 1913 and marked the 300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty, beginning with a week of receptions at the Winter Palace in February before the Imperial family took a pilgrimage in May to Moscow and the numerous cities that once occupied the ancient territory of the Grand Duchy of Muscovy. Harris spent the year touring across the various Ukrainian governorates. By May 1913, with the earnings from Harris's tours, Alexander purchased the popular Zerkalo Zhizni cinema from a man named G. Schmidt. In July, she arrived in the governorate seat of Voronezh. Upon her arrival, Harris took the city by storm. She thrilled audiences for two days at the Fantasy Gardens and the Petrovsky Yacht Club. Newspapers printed positive reviews of the way she would open her act playing a flute and ocarina, before imitating those instruments with her ethereal voice. Then, after performing a series of Russian romances, she began dancing her exotic snake-like Algerian dances which sent audiences into a frenzy. In early October, Harris was in Odessa performing at the popular North Hotel, which had been renovated the previous year, adding a permanent music hall in the gardens behind the hotel. During her engagement, Ophelia Gindra, daughter of an Austrian millionaire, fled to Odessa's North Hotel to elope with her boyfriend, who quickly abandoned her upon arrival. During this time, Grinda witnessed the Black Nightingale perform her exotic routine in the garden caf√©- chantant. Harris took Grinda under her wing and helped her get employment as a singer at the hotel. However, the director fired Gindra after her first performance, and Harris frequently attempted to encourage Grinda to return home to Austria. On October 11, after Harris's engagement at the hotel ended, the women arrived at the train station to return to Kharkov. While waiting in the train station waiting lounge, Grinda committed suicide by consuming potassium cyanide, dying within seconds. Fearful, Harris immediately called the police before boarding her train home. Back home in Kharkov, Harris was engaged at the Kommerchesky Garden Club on 21 Rymarskaya Street. The main hall was supplied with a stage and an orchestra pit, where the Black Nightingale performed her act. On October 17, the New Odessa and Morning of Kharkov newspapers announced that Harris's apartment had been raided, as it was suspected that she had stolen money and a feather ostrich boa from Gindra's personal belongings. After an ostrich boa was discovered, Harris claimed that she had purchased matching ones with Gindra. Harris was promptly arrested and sent back to Odessa to be questioned at the American consulate. She was soon cleared of all charges, released, and allowed to return home. On November 14, Kharkov's Southern Edge (Yuzhny Kray) newspaper announced Harris's performance at the Zerkalo Zhizni Theater: \\"In the theater \\"The Mirror of Life\\" a performance will be held at the present time by the great artist Ms. Galima, the same mulatto who, in Odessa had to endure quite a few troubles. Ms. Galima has a beautiful voice and an extremely original repertoire.\\" Film career and the Russian Revolution (1914‚Äì1917) On February 4, 1914, the electricity shut off at the Zerkalo Zhizni Cinema and chaos ensued. Outside an angry crowd gathered and Alexander calmed them, refunding their money and promising everyone one film free of charge the following day. Several months later, on May 9, Harris performed at her usual stomping grounds, the Kommerchesky Garden Club (May 9‚Äì15). On June 28, 1914, Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo, setting in motion the events leading to the outbreak of World War I. On July 25, according to later passport, Harris revisited Moscow, possibly taking an opportunity to visit Frederick B. Thomas. Thomas (now using the Russified version of his name, Fyodor Tomas) had become the owner of the Aumont Theater in 1911 and had converted it into Moscow's popular amusement park, the Aquarium Garden Theater. Besides its various entertainment establishments, the park also held private residences, hotels, cafes and cinemas. The latest attraction at the Aquarium was Jack Johnson, America's Heavyweight Champion, who was preparing for a boxing tournament between Johnson and M. P. Tsarev that was initially to be held on July 28. However, the tournament was called off due to the news of chaos coming from other parts of Europe. Harris would have witnessed off-duty army officers spending time at the Aquarium, sipping champagne, staring at the chorus girls, and some of them meeting and dining with Johnson. On August 1, Germany declared war on Russia, and on August 3, France. As the Russian Empire prepared for mobilization, Johnson and his wife caught the next train to Paris. Harris herself promptly returned home to Kharkov and began liquidating her various properties. On September 1, the Tsar declared that St. Petersburg would from then onwards be known as Petrograd. Russian high society began basking in what would be the Russian Empire's last year and Russian society's greatest season. There was a feverish desire to have a good time to combat the undercurrent of nervousness. It was a large distraction upon newspapers reporting on October 29 that the Ottoman Empire had attacked Russia. All of Petrograd indulged in wild partying, amusement and merrymaking before the Tsarist government initiated prohibition that November; alcohol was banned for the remainder of the war. One highlight of the year was Countess Shuvalov's black and white ball, with the uniformed Chevalier Gardes in attendance. Many people spent their evenings out at the opera and attending parties. Harris entertained at the popular establishments, watching everyone dancing and drinking. Two months after the start of the war, Turkish warships shelled cities on the southern coast of Russia, including Odessa. In response to this, the Mizinkin household relocated to Moscow, where Harris had purchased a comfortable apartment on 12 Bol'shoy Kozikhinskiy Pereulok, in the center of the city. Also living in the apartment building was the popular Russian actor from the Maly Theatre, Alexander Ostuzhev, who was appearing successfully in the production of V. Sardu's \\"Graf de Rizoor\\". Fyodor Tomas‚Äô Aquarium Garden establishment was less than ten minutes away on the Bolshaya Sadovaya. Lonely in the middle of Moscow without her husband and unable to tour due to the war, Harris decided to embark on a film career. After writing a scenario together with directors Sigmund Veselovsky and Parkomenko, Harris traveled to the G.I. Libkin Studios in Yaroslavl to star in her debut film Satan's Woman (Zhenshchina Satana). Released May 15 by the Alians Film Office, the 5-hour, 1350 meter film was an interesting attempt on Russian soil to create an intricate American adventure-drama. Harris became an overnight sensation due to the success of the film. That summer at Moscow's Aquarium Garden, Fyodor Tomas sold tobacco, then sent the proceeds to the troops in the war. Elsewhere, bazaars were organized to sell items to raise money for the troops. On June 12, for the first time in five years, Harris renewed her American passport, although there were discrepancies, as she claimed to have been born in Washington D.C. in 1886. Before the year was over, the Kinolent Film Office released the comedy film, Feet Up! (Nogi Vverkh), in which Harris starred alongside actor Tikhomirov. It was directed by Boris Kramskoy, who also held the main role within the film. In 1916, to supplement an income, the Mizikin home doubled as a high-class brothel that serviced soldiers and aristocratic clientele. By the beginning of 1917, Harris decided to follow in the footsteps of her husband and attended Bolshevik rallies and meetings across Moscow. Unfortunately, during a public demonstration held in Moscow sometime in January 1917, Harris witnessed armed gendarmes fire upon the crowds and was soaked in blood as a man beside her was murdered. On February 6, she renewed her American passport, expressing a wish to travel to neutral Scandinavia. After the February Revolution and with Russia in a dire situation, Harris's artistic career was suddenly interrupted and, like the rest of the American expat community, she pondered at the idea of returning to America. The war and revolution had abruptly ended Russia's importance on the continental theatrical circuit. Extensive touring was impossible and many Russian establishments began shutting down. The vast majority of the African-American community in Russia were rushing to Petrograd's American embassy and Moscow's consulate to apply for passports to sail across the Black Sea towards Turkey and Romania or board Trans-Siberian trains towards Manchuria and Japan in their journey back to America. However, from letters she received from friends such as Ollie Burgoyne, Saidie Sellyna and Ida Forsyne who had returned home to America, she was able to learn about the changes in the American entertainment scene. The majority of black establishments only wanted light- skinned Negro women, and Harlem cabarets had women perform shake dances in between the tables and mingle with the audiences as jazz played in the background. Such activities didn't happen in Russian cabarets and music halls. Most of the successful Negro performers returning to America from Europe found themselves suddenly penniless and turning to domestic work. By May, Russia was already adapting to the country's new political reality, although most activities continued as before. However, Moscow's police forces were disarmed and disbanded by the rebels. The Provisional government declared broad civil liberties. It also pardoned all political prisoners, including terrorists; in addition, about two thousand thieves and murderers were released from prisons in Moscow. The city was flooded with a wave of crime there was looting in the streets and attacks on houses and businesses. Even the Mizikin residence was looted; the thieves got away with many valuables, including Harris's American passport. The new city militia, which consisted mainly of volunteer students, was ineffective, and homeowners were forced to organize their own associations for mutual protection. Throughout the course of the October Revolution, Harris and her fellow brothel girls banded together and tended to the wounded Bolsheviks that they dragged inside from the daily street skirmishes. By the end of the week, dozens of buildings in the center of Moscow were damaged by shots from rifles, machine guns and artillery fire, including the most revered cathedrals in the Kremlin itself. On November 20, the Moscow Military Revolutionary Committee proclaimed its victory, declaring that the Cadets and its other opponents had surrendered or been killed. On November 29, Harris used her connections to gather the ingredients to produce a large Thanksgiving feast for American Consul Maddin Summers and the remnants of Moscow's dwindling American Consulate staff. Harris was running out of time to leave. The Bolsheviks did not want people to slip out from under their power, and everyone who wanted to leave Moscow had to get a special permit. Train traffic throughout the country had deteriorated greatly: the schedule became irregular, tickets were in short supply, rolling stock was deteriorated, and delays became frequent due to engine failure. In addition, getting on a train in Moscow did not guarantee the achievement of the destination. At each station, many people tried to get on the train that the passengers had to fight for their seats. Harris enlisted with the Red Cross, serving as a nurse aboard armoured train 1045 that traversed south into the Ukraine. Russian Civil War (1918‚Äì1925) As soon as Harris returned home to Moscow, on March 3, 1918, the newly formed Soviet Union backed out of the war after signing the Brest-Litovsk Treaty. Ten days later, 30,000 German and Austrian troops marched into Ukraine. By mid-March, the Germans were already in Odessa and the new puppet state became known as the Hetmanate. The region became terribly dangerous; besides the Red Army attempting to push out the Germans, the Ukraine's notorious criminal gangs (their brazen behavior comparable to Chicago's gangsters) began a reign of terror with nightly burglaries and murders in the streets. On March 11, as Moscow was declared the new capital of Soviet Russia, Lenin and the Soviet government arrived from Petrograd, hastily settling themselves in the city. Harris attended a rally held in Red Square, where Lenin gave a powerful speech. Standing on Skull Place before St. Basil's Cathedral, Lenin was explaining the meaning of the Bolshevik cause when he spied Harris at the front of the crowds. Extending his right hand, he spoke directly to Harris, \\"The ideal communist is to open the road for all the downtrodden races of the world. For you, comrade, especially, as we regard your race the most downtrodden in the world. We want you to feel when you come to Russia that you are a human being. The Red Army is ready to give its life at any time for all the downtrodden races!\\" Immediately the crowds hoisted Harris up upon their shoulders and bore her triumphantly through the cheering audience. Around this time, Harris had purchased a 15-room house located at 4 Kalanchevskaya in eastern Moscow's working class Krasnaya Vorota neighborhood. The five-story Art Nouveau style house, designed by the architect Alexander Nikiforov and built between 1875 and 1880, was located in the railroad- infested Krasnoselsky district. As usual, the sumptuously decorated house was kept in order by a team of servants and also doubled as a brothel. Due to the deteriorating health conditions in Moscow, cholera and typhoid began to spread. Moscow was also on the verge of starvation; the main food products were issued on the cards, and prices on the black market were too high. It was then that small businessmen appeared, who became known as the \\"bagmen\\", to partially fill the gap. Crowds of peasants began to arrive in the city from distant villages with bags of local food ‚Äì flour, bread, butter, cereals, eggs ‚Äì which they exchanged for industrial goods still found in the city on the black market, such as women's headscarves, chintz, string, sugar, soap and matches. Hungry citizens also made such trips in the opposite direction. The Bolsheviks viewed this trade as a form of illegal speculation and tried to thwart it, but the need was great in the city, as was the divergence of prices in the city and the village, and this made the risk both necessary and profitable. Inevitably, the stations in Moscow became one of the main places where buyers and sellers met. Living between Moscow's three major railroad stations, Harris became a frequent black market shopper, having very little issues due to her numerous connections to Russia's criminal underground. Her connections also proved to be valuable when the Bolsheviks' new Cheka secret police began targeting private residences to confiscate, rob and extort the bourgeoisie. Across the city, homeowners and tenants were often thrown into the street as representatives of the new order drove into their houses and apartments. It was certainly interesting that throughout the course of this plundering, a popular African American actress was able to maintain control over her massive home in the heart of Moscow. That summer, Harris found herself unemployed. No longer the wealthy aristocrat she once was, she now listed in the category of the declasse bourgeoisie. The Soviet government began liquidizing and nationalizing all of its theaters, cabarets and music halls. Even the once popular Aquarium establishment was being occupied by a local military garrison. Besides earning enough income from her successful brothel, she soon found employment with the Narkompros. Shortly after the October Revolution, the old system of education and culture management was deposed and the new system, gradually and with great difficulty, was created. With the establishment of Soviet power, teachers, university professors and cultural figures were unable to find a common language for the development of education and culture in the new Soviet Union. In response, the People's Commissariat of Education (Narkompros) was organized. Much of 1919, Harris was sent east to Simbirsk with a delegation of the Narkompros to aid in the establishment of educational and cultural centers. Her primary job was that of an interpreter and English teacher to Soviet officials. Simbirsk (now Ulyanovsk), a bustling provincial city on the banks of the Volga and Sviyagi rivers with a population of nearly 64,000, was on the frontlines of the Russian Civil War's Eastern Front. Due to the Civil War, the city was in ruins, local industry was disrupted due to a lack of fuel, tools and raw materials. Street lighting disappeared, boulevards and parks were neglected, houses were destroyed, and bazaars and shops were abandoned. Not far from the city, Commander Jan Blumberg and his 5th Army armed with 10,000 men, 42 guns and 142 machine guns held off the White Army's Western Army led by Mikhail Hanzhin. Since February 7, the city had been the headquarters of the Revolutionary Military Council (headed by Commander Sergei Kamenev and Sergei Gusev), leaving the city swarming with military personnel. Anti-revolutionary in sympathy, during her sojourn in the city, Harris became involved with various White Army military officers, aiding them in their schemes against the new Soviet government. During the summer of 1919, after Simbirsk was briefly captured by the Czechoslovak Legion, she returned home to Moscow, continuing to work with the White Army, offering her Moscow home as a hiding spot and meeting place for them. On September 24, the Cheka raided the Mizinkin residence where they discovered numerous soldiers holed up. The entire group (including Harris) were swiftly arrested and taken to the infamous Lubyanka Prison. In 1918, the Council of People's Commissars was liquidated and nationalized. Around May 1919, the building was transferred to the Special Section of the Moscow Cheka. While Harris sat quietly in her cell, the White Guard soldiers were executed by firing squad. On November 19, Harris was brought before a Cheka official, who was looking into her case. She immediately denied any knowledge of the counterrevolutionaries, claiming she was simply running a legitimate business and didn't engage in politics with her clientele. The official replied, much to her surprise, \\"You know the only reason we didn't shoot you was because you‚Äôre a Negro. You‚Äôre free to go now. I advise you to find some useful work. Keep out of trouble.\\" Harris was promptly released. On February 11, 1921, the People's Commissariat of Education was dissolved. Shutting down her successful brothel, Harris converted her mansion into a comfortable American pension, where she housed Red Cross officials, journalists and other Westerners. Being located between three major railway stations, she soon managed to arrange for all the railway information bureaus to immediately direct all visiting Americans to her establishment. That summer, after the Civil War finally drew to a close, a Famine raged across the Volga region known as Russia's breadbasket. In September, when the American Relief Association, Colonel Haskell, arrived in the Soviet Union to aid the Russians in their fight against famine, Harris organized a laundry service for the ARA relief workers based in Moscow, while Alexander delivered the wash and called for it. During this time, Harris reunited with her old friend, Corett√© Alefred (now Coretti Arle-Titz), who had recently returned to Russia from the Ukraine with her new husband Boris Titz. The couple decided to reside in Moscow instead of Petrograd, which had once been Coretti's stomping grounds. The two women most likely hadn't seen each other since 1917 and Harris would have been extremely shocked upon hearing Coretti's false tales she spun to Soviet newspapers, including one story that she originated from Mexico, among other tales. In late 1922, Ukrainian-born American journalist of the New York world, Samuel Spewack and his wife Bella, traveled to Germany and the Soviet Union, where they resided for the next four years. On September 9, during their surjourn in Moscow, Samuel paid a visit to the Mizinkin residence only to be shocked to discover that despite the Revolution, nationalization, Civil War and the raging famine, Harris was able to maintain possession of her fine collection of rugs, massive jewelry, silks and silverware. In between cooking, Harris rambled on (in fluent Russian) about her days as an exotic dancer, performing for the Shah of Persia, her disappointment that she could no longer move nimbly as she once could since her waistline had increased, and also expressed her desire to return to the United States. Her husband, Alexander, also chimed in, expressing his desire to travel to America as well to write scenarios for Hollywood films. Soviet worker (1926‚Äì1933) 1926 marked the end of Harris's career as a successful actress as she sought employment as a textile worker at the Proletarsky Trud Silk Mill. This new shift in her life also marked the end of her fifteen-year marriage with Alexander Mizinkin, who moved out some time later. In the meantime, the Soviets finally seized control over her magnificent mansion, gave Harris two rooms on the first floor, and converted the remaining rooms into apartments, which ten Russian families soon inhabited. With all six of her servants dismissed, Harris was frequently accompanied by a Lithuanian servant, one of her former prostitutes, who provided assistance when Harris built an improvised kitchen in the common corridor of the building, where she spent hours busy with pots and pans cooking hash, pork and beans, beef stew, cabbage and ham hocks, fried chicken and cornbread. Although her American boarding house was gone, Harris continued providing southern hospitality to every visiting American that she came across. \\"Just supply me the rubles, I‚Äôll find the stuff\\", she would say to any American that wanted a home-cooked meal. The early groups of African-Americans, such as Harry Haywood, who arrived in April 1926, quickly grew fearful spending time around Harris. Now classified by the Soviets as a declass√© bourgeoisie, she was extremely bitter about her present situation and frequently criticized the Soviet regime, meanwhile praising the old Tsarist system. She was often recalled saying, \\"I'm like a cat with nine lives, honey. I always landed on my feet...been doing it all my life wherever I been. These Bolsheviks ain't gonna kill me.\\" In late 1928, an American communist from Idaho, James Pierce, arrived at the Soviet Union for a five-year stay in Leningrad and Moscow. By September, he secured a room at Kalanchevskaya 4, eventually becoming very close with Harris. Her apartment had become a regular Saturday evening meeting place of American expats. In between serving home-cooked meals, Harris pounding out jazz numbers on her piano, coupled with her melodious singing, added a dash of color to the drab grey Russian winter. During the 1930s, Harris became one of the lead speakers for the International Red Aid (MOPR), travelling Russia and giving fiery speeches protesting against racism, singing spirituals and writing poems for Soviet newspapers. On June 26, 1932, Harris, Coretti Arle-Titz, Robert \\"Bob\\" Ross and Robert Robinson gathered at Nikolayevsky Station to welcome twenty- two Afro-American artists that were invited to the Soviet Union to produce a film depicting Negro laborers in their difficult working conditions in the American South. The film was based on Vladimir Mayakovsky‚Äôs 1925 poem, Black & White, which protested American racism and imperialism. The film was sponsored by the Comintern and was to be produced by the Russo-German film company Meschrabpom. Harris pushed towards the front of the crowd of government officials, writers and actors while shouting, \\"Bless God! Lord! I‚Äôm sure glad to see some Negroes! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!\\" She spent the majority of her time entertaining her new colleagues at the Hotel Metropol, eventually receiving a role in the film. Other times, the group traveled over to the Krasnaya Vorota district, where Harris entertained them from the comfort of her home. She washed their dirty laundry and prepared supper for them. Harris had some of the best food in Moscow and yet had only an ordinary workers‚Äô ration card, but she knew all about the black markets and speakeasies. In a city where almost nothing was open after midnight, Harris could always find a place to buy a drink. Her clientele was mostly American, however, because her Russian neighbors had no money to supply the ingredients. During his visits, Langston Hughes noticed her neighborhood was a smoky, smelly, noisy area, and he often complained about why she remained living there. \\"Man, you ain't seen no rooms for rent signs, have you?\\" she answered. But she added, \\"If anything busts loose against them Bolshies, I'm gonna highball out‚Äôa here on the first and fastest train out of one of them stations for anywhere on the down line.\\" During the first week of July, an Anti-Scottsboro rally, organized by the International Red Aid, was held at the Park of Rest & Culture, where Harris, her face illuminated by the blazing floodlights and voice magnified by loudspeakers, performed a number of spirituals and delivered a fiery speech in fluent Russian before the masses. Not long after the disappointing reality that the Black and White film wasn't to be, Harris found herself employed as a saleswoman for one of Moscow's Torgsin shops, where she was frequently seen leaving with a bulging bag filled with cooking ingredients and vodka, which she called \\"Russian corn whiskey\\". In early 1933, while employed as the chief correspondent for the Stankoimport State Trust, the long years of Russian exposure failed to remove much of Harris's deeply-ingrained American values, which frequently caused her to become overcome with nostalgia. As she grew older, her desire to see America grew stronger, and when the United States finally recognized the Soviet Union during the summer, the American consulate helped to arrange for her return to New York. That August, after an interview mentioning a wish to visit the US, Harris was granted permission to travel to Latvia to receive an American passport before boarding the S.S Milwaukee from Hamburg, back to New York after 32 years. Later life (1934‚Äì1940) Harris was invited to several functions across New York City speaking of her success and experiences in Russia, up until February 1934, when she was suddenly hospitalized and placed in a nursing home due to her failing health. In December 1937, during an interview with journalist Theodore Poston, she mentioned that she was no longer interested in remaining in the United States, slowly saving funds to return home to the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, she was unable to return and, by 1940, she had moved to Brooklyn, living with her nephew, Richard Matthews, and his family, where she remained, hoping to return to Russia after the war, until her death.

The frontal thrust, conventionally known as the Naga thrust, is seen to be composed of four different thrusts. The uppermost thrust is known as the Haflong (Disang) thrust. The Naga-Disang (Haflong) Overthrust area includes besides the Naga Hills proper, a few long ranges of hills fringing the plain of Upper Assam, and a large part of the North Cachar Hills (the Belt of Schuppen). Haflong Fault is the south-westward continuation of the Disang thrust from the Naga Hills to Haflong where the thrust becomes a narrow but complex fracture belt.Haflong Fault, Banglapedia Along with two major thrusts, the Haflong-Naga Thrust and Disang Thrust, studies revealed three minor thrusts (ST-1, ST-2, ST-3) in the BoS. The westward continuation of this fracture belt ultimately passes into the Dauki fault. About 60-km west of Haflong the Dauki fault appears to be a nearly vertical break and the beds on the two sides show no great difference in age. Further west downthrown is southerly and still further west in Garo Hills the fault heads to the north along which the Shillong plateau has been shifted southwards. In the southwest at the southern fringe of the Shillong plateau Haflong-Naga Thrust and Disang Thrust merge to form a major East-West fault known as the Dauki-Haflong Thrust. In Haflong thrusting area, there is much variation in the structure of the south dipping monocline. In the east, between Haflong and Dauki, the beds north of the fault are mostly horizontal or dip gently down to the south, while those of the south of the fault dip more steeply and in places are nearly vertical. There is extensive shattering in a belt several kilometres wide along the fault. West of Haflong, where the fault has little stratigraphical throw, the geosynclinal facies of the Eocene approaches within 7 km of the Kopili beds which are part of the calcareous shelf facies of the Eocene, and which immediately overlie the Sylhet Limestone. In the North Cachar Hills it overrides all the lower thrusts to rest directly on the Foreland Spur.

Family and education Howard Bruner Schaffer was born on 21 July 1929 in New York City. He had a sister, Doris Schaffer O'Brien, and was married to Teresita Currie Schaffer. He completed his BA. at Harvard University in 1950. Between 1953-1955 he attended Columbia University. Career In 1951-1953, Schaffer served in the U.S. Army. In the 1969-1970 period he was a scholar at Princeton University and was also an administrator and professor at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy. Subsequently, he had a career of thirty- six years in the Foreign service, dealing mainly with America's relations with the South Asia region. His early postings were in New Delhi, Seoul and Kuala Lumpur. He served as political counselor to the American embassies in Pakistan between 1974-1977 and also served as political counselor to the American embassy in India during 1977-1979. He then held the post of U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh during 1984-1987. Schaffer was twice Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs in the US State Department. Works *Chester Bowles: New Dealer in Cold War *Ellsworth Bunker: Global Troubleshooter, Vietnam Hawk *The Limits of Influence: American Role in Kashmir *How Pakistan negotiates with the United States: Riding the Roller Coaster Besides books, Schaffer has also authored several articles on matters related to South Asia. =The Limts of Influence: America's Role in Kashmir= Robert Hathaway notes in Foreign Affairs that Schaffer has written an \\"exemplary account\\" of the United States' efforts to settle or at least manage the Kashmir Conflict. Hathaway observes that Schaffer argues that the time is right for a fresh US initiative to help resolve the Kashmir Conflict.Hathaway, Robert M. \\"The Limts of Influence: America's Role in Kashmir: Book Review\\", Foreign Affairs, vol. 89, no. 2, 2010, pp. 173‚Äì173. Surinder Mohan of the Jawaharlal Nehru University notes that it is a \\"remarkable\\" book which traces the Oval Office's efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue right from the beginning. He observes that the book follows a framework highlighting America's intermittently active and inactive participation from 1948 to the mid 1960s. Mohan observes that the book describes well the failure of all the parties involved: the United Nations, United States, India and Pakistan. While maintaining that it is a fine book Mohan expresses disappointment with the absence of the analysis of the impacts of the 1971 war and Indo-US nuclear deal. Mohan concludes that the book is timely, devoid of jargon and highly accessible. Mohan notes that the book contributes substantially to the literature on the Kashmir conflict and Mohan also recommends that the book be on the desk of every policy-maker and student of the region.Mohan, Surinder. \\"The Limts of Influence: America's Role in Kashmir: Book Review\\", \\"International Affairs, vol. 86, no. 2, 2010, pp. 584‚Äì585.

Cottenr observes that while the book concentrates on America's role it also provides a detailed outline of the conflict from its genesis to its contemporary geopolitical impact. According to Cotter, Schaffer is one of the few who can cover the topic thoroughly. Cotter notes that Schaffer's detailed analysis is buttressed with extensive footnotes which take heavily from the official documents from the dispute's early days. Cotter in his conclusion remarks that there is \\"unlikely to be a better textbook example of such a situation than that offered to readers by Howard Schaffer.Cotter, Michael W. \\"The Limits of Influence: America's Role in Kashmir: Book Review\\" American Diplomacy, 2010. =Chester Bowles: New Dealer in the Cold War= According to John M.

Carroll notes that Schaffer assesses Bowler's diplomatic ideas by \\"carefully examining\\" his role as American ambassador to India and as Kennedy's undersecretary of state. Carroll observes that one of the many strengths of the book is Schaffer's critical approach to Bowles. Carroll concludes that Schaffer has made an\\" enlightening analysis.\\"Carroll, John M. \\"Chester Bowles: New Dealer in the Cold War: Book Review\\", The Historian, vol. 57, no. 2, 1995, pp.395 Gary R Hess, of Bowling Green State University, notes that despite being sympathetic to Bowles, Schaffer has been able to see his flaws.

It was found in a sample collected from the surface of a tropical aquarium brain coral. It actively feeds on Procryptobia sorokini, probably immobilising its prey through discharging a previously unknown type of extrusome named an ancoracyst. Genetic analysis shows that it is not closely related to any known lineage, but it may be most closely related to a grouping of haptophytes and centrohelids (Haptista). It is notable for having a gene-rich mitochondrial genome, the largest known outside the jakobids or Diphylleia rotans. Uniquely, it appears to contain both the nucleus-encoded holocytochrome c synthase system III and the mitochondrion-encoded bacterial cytochrome c maturation system I. Taxonomy A 2018 study from Cavalier-Smith, Chao & Lewis created a new subphylum and subsequent lower taxonomic ranks for Ancoracysta twista. They also created a new combination for Colponema marisrubri (Mylnikov & Tikhonenkov, 2009), which was shown to be ultrastructurally similar and phylogenetically close to A. twista, thus renaming it A. marisrubri.

It is a Romanesque church that sometimes is referred to as built in Anglo- Saxon style. The church is dated to the first half of the 12th century and was dedicated to Saint Mary the Virgin. In the early 18th century, the church was expanded eight meters to the west. On the north side of the choir, a sacristy with burial chamber below was built in 1674. However, this soon became too small, and in 1713 a larger burial chapel was built, next to the sacristy. In the early 20th century, the church was restored. The church and surrounding burial site is considered as an important cultural heritage by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage and protected by law.Tanum kirkested Kulturminnes√∏k, Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage Tanum church has retained its rich inventory and has been a popular motive for many visual artists, among them Harriet Backer.

The Renaissance altarpiece is from 1663, where the main picture shows Jesus on the cross flanked by Saint Mary and Saint John the Apostle (which is also a motive in some of the murals). The baptismal font was performed by Svend Svanneberg in 1724. The pulpit, which is round, is probably also performed by Svend Svanneberg. There are also exposed murals on the walls.

It was designed by architect Jan Wallinder and have an interior designed by Rolf and Margareta √Öberg.V√§lkommen till Ljungby bibliotek. \\"Ljungby kommunbibliotek\\", local collection, Ljungby library It is visited daily by between 500 and 800 patrons and is large. The library also contain an attached gallery, which also works as a lecture hall, and a small caf√©.  History  It is unknown when Ljungby got its first library. There should have been a parish library sometime between 1860 and 1870, but no traces of this have been found. The only known parish library in current Ljungby municipality was in Ryssby. = Three room plus kitchen on Storgatan= At the start of the 19th century there existed several smaller libraries in Ljungby. Ljungby folkbibliotek (Eng: \\"Ljungby public library\\") opened in October 1920 with the creation of its statutes. The library was located in the municipal meeting room and was open every Saturday between two and half-past two. It was managed by the chairman of the library board rector Gustav Str√∂mvall and librarian head teacher Algot Bj√∂rkman. Ljungby k√∂pings bibliotek (Eng: Ljungby market town's library) had its own intended premises at Vinkelhaken 4 on Storgatan street ‚Äì a stone-throw away from the court house ‚Äì that was rented already in 1921, but did not open until 1922. The apartment the library was located in had three rooms plus kitchen, with woodshed and access to the laundry room. The rent was 650 kronor per year. With the first governmental grant of 218 kronor and 94 √∂re they bought their first books on 1 October 1921. Their collection then consisted of 78 books and 23 newspapers. The library board consisted of first chairman h√§radsh√∂vding Nils Munck af Rosensch√∂ld, first secretary folk school teacher Ernst Malmertz, and master baker Axel Johansson. In 1921 there was five libraries in Ljungby; Ljungby k√∂ping, Ljungby folkbibliotek, Logen 2876 Ljung, ABF, and Logen Finnveden. Ernst Malmertz called the representatives from these libraries to a meeting regarding the possibilities of a merge. Logen 2876 Ljung and ABF said that they could not participate in a merger, and Logen Finnveden was absent. However, the representatives from Ljungby folkbibliotek and Ljungby k√∂ping agreed to merge their libraries. Shortly thereafter was Ljungby folkbibliotek's collection moved to Ljungby k√∂ping's premises at Storgatan. At the end of 1927, Ljungby had 2,924 inhabitants and the library on Storgatan had 769 bands and 176 lenders. =K√∂pingsg√•rden, the old clog factory = Overview of the library at K√∂pingsg√•rden in 1937. John Howding (taken 1932), librarian and later library director at Ljungby K√∂pings Bibliotek. In 1928 the library moved to the old clog factory K√∂pingsg√•rden on Sk√•negatan street, which they had already bought in 1925 for 40,000 kronor. With the move the library acquired an additional two rooms and now had of space. Librarian there was John Howding, which in 1925 had succeeded Ernst Malmertz. Howding managed to quadruple the library's governmental grant by formally becoming a library director and acquire a collection of reference books. But the Skol√∂verstyrelse still forced Howding and library assistant Karl Loby to attend a two-week library course in Stockholm. In 1936 the library expanded to , after several years of complaints from the Skol√∂verstyrelse about the all to small rooms. In the trade paper Biblioteksbladet Howding said: > \\"[...]Since Ljungby is our country's second youngest city, and also one of > the smaller ones, with only circa 5000 inhabitants, no one dared expect that > the city already would appear among them who during last year acquired > stately new buildings with modernly furnished libraries... It is the hope of > the library board that these facilities, although small and simple, would be > a calm refuge for those of the city's inhabitants for whom useful knowledge > and pleasant amusement is the sought-after goal.\\" - John Howding In 1937 Howding managed at last to fulfill the merge, that had partially failed fifteen years earlier, with the remaining libraries in Ljungby. They acquired additional 550 to 600 bands ‚Äì which can be compared to the 184 newly sourced books their then budget allowed. In 1941 the library reached a peak of 11,800 loaned books and 900 borrowers, with a population of about 5,300 inhabitants. In 1957 Ljungby's first qualified librarian was hired. = Brunnsparken, the former restaurant = On 1 July 1965, the library moved to a larger premises of by Brunnsparken park, when the previous restaurant moved to the newly built Terraza building. At the end of the 1960s the library lent out 60,000 books per year and was open 28 hours per week. In 1971 a national municipal reform occurred and Ljungby municipality's population increased to 26,000 inhabitants; but the library was just suited for a population of half that size, despite that the building had been expanded by . The Cultural Committee of Ljungby ‚Äì which had replaced the library board ‚Äì concluded that there was too little staff, too few books, and too small rooms.  The mobile library  As an initial solution to these problems a bookmobile was bought which made its first trip on 23 August 1976. During the first trip 2,400 books were carried. Not all of these belonged to Ljungby library as only 700 had been bought during the year, whereof 165 of these were children's books. But since these 700 books was not enough another 2,000 books was lent from V√§xj√∂ Library. An additional 40,000 SEK in grant would subsequently be requested from the cultural committee to fill the mobile library with their own books. On 15 October 1976, TV channel TRU showed a 10-minute program about the mobile library in Ljungby called \\"Questions about the future - a rolling library\\", a part of the three-episode series \\"Questions about the future\\". The program included issues related to branch libraries. In 1979 the mobile library accounted for twenty-eight percent of the total lending in Ljungby, which for comparing was as much as the whole library at the end of the 1960s.  The plans of a dedicated library building  After the mobile library; step two of the size problem started, the construction of a proper library building. Rejected proposals from 1974 and 1975 had suggested an expansion of the current library. But in 1977 it was found that a completely new building was needed. One that was especially adapted to the unique needs of a library, which could serve for 20 to 30 years. In 1979 the municipal council decided that the new library building was going to be a wing of the planned new municipal building at block Herkules just outside the central part of Ljungby. The proposal created debate at the same time it turned out that the municipal budget was not enough to build the two buildings, plus the ice rink that also was planned. To save millions of SEK and not have to build a \\"brag and indulgence library\\" it was suggested to rebuild an old car hall. In 1981 the municipal council decided to only build the library; the new plans of a municipal building were scrapped and the current municipal building was instead expanded.  Ljungby Library  Pontus Ljungberg's painting of Phoenix on the canopy above the entrance. Portrait of Folke Fridell by Maire M√§nnik outside the library. Ingemar Svensson's non-depicting sculpture \\"Glob\\". Ljungby Library was designed by architect Jan Wallinder and opened in October 1982. At the opening the library served a population of 27,000 inhabitants, contained 60,000 volumes, and during the opening year lent 141,000 books. The trade journal Biblioteksbladet, 1985, began an article with \\"the library in Ljungby has been described by experts as both functionally and architecturally the perhaps most interesting library building, which in recent years has been built in Sweden\\". However, they commented on the library's location as \\"too far from the center\\". Per Nyeng from the Danish trade journal Bibliotek 70 described the library's interior as \\"a true delight for the eye\\". Librarian Ingemar Ehlin from Uppsala City Library considered it to be one of the most interesting libraries for its time, thanks to the innovative architecture and its functionality. However, he too was critical to the libraries placement on an old industrial site on \\"the outskirt of the city\\" among scattered apartments and houses. = Placement = According to the original plans the library would be a wing to Ljungby's planned municipal building, so was not the case but the traces of this decision can still be seen. The library is awkwardly located quite a good distance from the city center, which only with good will can be called centrally, surrounded by apartments and small houses without any seemingly justifiable reasons for its position. The absence of the planned municipal building is also one of the reasons the building is located unusually far into the plot. The placement makes it hard to attract passersby as there is little insight to the shelves, books, and visitors. However, this deviation can contribute to the library attaching itself to memory. = Exterior = The library is a red, two floor, brick-building with black felt roof and looks, partly, like a flat pyramid with broad steps in glass. The building is almost symmetrical, unlike other public buildings in Ljungby, with only the projecting gallery and lecture hall breaking free. On the canopy above the entrance is Pontus Ljungberg's painting of a Phoenix. On the building's opposite side the staff facilities, garage, and loading platform comes forward which gives the building - according to Ingemar Ehlin - \\"two distinct facades instead of a front and back\\". In front of the library is a large courtyard, a result of the previous planned municipal building absence and the then resulting unusual placement of the library far into the plot. The courtyard consists mostly of trees, shrubs, and green areas. Centrally placed on the yard is Ingemar Svensson's sculpture \\"Glob\\" (Eng: \\"Globe\\") from 1981, Ljungby's first non-depicting artwork. On the yard's western side is Maire M√§nnik's bust of Folke Fridell from 1989, one of Sweden's leading working- class writers who lived in Lagan outside Ljungby. In the southeastern part of the yard is Harald Ahlman's \\"Labyrint\\", from 1988, based on the design of classical labyrinths created from 463 stones. = Interior = Directly adjacent to the entrance is the newspaper room which usually opens a few hours before the rest of the library. The newspaper room is part of the main library room, but is separated by bookshelves and screens. When you enter the library you are met by the circulation desk which is flanked by Sven Ljungberg's pillars that are decorated with birch trunks and owls. The library room itself is a large open space without shielding walls. The reasons behind this is to make the building clear and easy to navigate. The architect Jan Wallinder have said: \\"If the plot size is favorable and the size of the library is moderate as in Ljungby, a library plan can be set up so that the public rooms present itself to the visitor at the first step into the house\\". To the left of the entrance is the children library and to the right is the adult library. Both these departments do also meet at the opposite side of the library room, where the passage to the outside atrium, which they both surround, can be found. The staff rooms are located on the upper floors of the building's center portion which runs around the rectangular atrium. All of these rooms have windows facing the atrium and doors out to the gallery which take the form of a mezzanine floor and give the staff an overview of what is happening in the library room. The gallery has become the motif for the entire building and reminds visitors of the constant work that is going on in the library. The interior was designed by Rolf and Margareta √Öberg, which among other things introduced Sweden's first stepless height-adjustable counter in the library. Rolf √Öberg spent much time during the light design with combining day light and electric light. Instead of a fixed central lighting fixtures the luminaires was integrated into the bookshelves. This means that the shelves can be moved without the lighting being affected and that the light becomes smoother from top to bottom shelf.  Branches  Ljungby library have branches in Lagan, Ryssby, and Lidhult. There is also a mobile library that visit various stops around Ljungby municipality.

Background The long-standing national Militia of the United Kingdom was revived by the Militia Act of 1852, enacted during a period of international tension. As before, units were raised and administered on a county basis, and filled by voluntary enlistment (although conscription by means of the Militia Ballot might be used if the counties failed to meet their quotas). Training was for 56 days on enlistment, then for 21‚Äì28 days per year, during which the men received full army pay. Under the Act, Militia units could be embodied by Royal Proclamation for full-time home defence service in three circumstances:Litchfield, pp. 1‚Äì7.Dunlop, pp. 42‚Äì5.Grierson, pp. 27‚Äì8.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 91‚Äì2. * 1. 'Whenever a state of war exists between Her Majesty and any foreign power'. * 2. 'In all cases of invasion or upon imminent danger thereof'. * 3. 'In all cases of rebellion or insurrection'. The 1852 Act introduced Artillery Militia units in addition to the traditional infantry regiments. Their role was to man coastal defences and fortifications, relieving the Royal Artillery (RA) for active service. History The unit was officially formed in December 1854 under the title of Galway Militia Artillery, but unlike many other Militia units it was not embodied during the Crimean War or Indian Mutiny, and no officers were appointed to it. The first commandant was Captain O'Hara, late of the 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays), who assumed command on 5 June 1878 and was commandant throughout the unit's remaining existence.Litchfield, p. 90.Army List, various dates. The Artillery Militia was reorganised into 11 divisions of garrison artillery in 1882, and the Galway unit became the 5th Brigade, North Irish Division, RA.Spiers, Late Victorian Army, pp. 63‚Äì4. The establishment of the unit was set at 414 for its four batteries, but the enrolled strength was always well below that, 286 being the highest number recorded (in 1886). This probably led to the unit's disbandment, which came in 1888. The permanent staff (one officer and 17 warrant officers, serjeants and trumpeters) transferred to the 4th (Dublin City) and 7th (Wicklow) Brigades of the North Irish Division, RA.Litchfield, Appendix 5.

Eight sections of the bill, sometimes called the Trade Mark Act of 1870, introduced trademarks to United States federal law, although that portion was later deemed unconstitutional after the Trade- Mark Cases. Copyright For copyrights, the Act codified the right of authors to make dramatizations and translations of literary works; copyright had previously been denied to translations by the holding in Stowe v. Thomas (1853), in which Harriet Beecher Stowe unsuccessfully sued for infringement over a translation of Uncle Tom's Cabin into German. It also established a legal deposit requirement for copyrighted works; two copies of each work were to be submitted to the Library of Congress. =Copyright amendments= The act was amended several times for various purposes. * In 1873, Congress gave jurisdiction of copyright cases to federal courts. * In 1874, they added a requirement of notice via the phrase \\"Entered according to act of Congress, in the year ____ by ____, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington\\" or \\"Copyright\\" paired with the year and author's name.http://www.truthorfables.net/copyright_law_us_1874.htmhttp://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep208/usrep208260/usrep208260.pdf * Also in 1874, copyrights for prints and labels in manufactured goods were put under the jurisdiction of the Patent Office. * In 1879, the Post Office Appropriations Act arguably made it illegal to mail copyright infringing works. * In 1882, copyright notices for designs on useful articles were allowed to be placed on the back or bottom of those articles. * In 1891, the International Copyright Act of 1891 passed. * In 1893, Congress granted amnesty to late deposits of books for copyright and allowed all to send in their works for protection by March 1. The Act passed on March 3. * In 1895, the Printing Act of 1895 codified the Wheaton v. Peters decision and stated explicitly that \\"no Government publications shall be copyrighted.\\" * Also in 1895, the penalties for infringing the copyright of photographs were limited at the request of newspapers. * In 1897, Congress allowed the restriction of public performances of musical compositions and added criminal penalties if the illicit performance was for profit. * Also in 1897, Congress established the Register of Copyrights. Thorvald Solberg entered office later that year. * A third amendment in 1897 extended a $100 penalty for affixing a false copyright notice to a product to anyone who knowingly created, sold, or imported works with false notices. This included new copies of copyrighted works without the required notice and issuing the work under someone else's name. * In 1904, in response to foreign countries threatening to boycott the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, Congress passed an amendment that provided ad interim copyrights to foreign works that lasted for two years. They did not have to follow the manufacturing or notice requirements, but they were entitled to a full 42 years of restriction if they did. * In 1905, another ad interim copyright law amended the law to satisfy France and Germany in response to threats to repeal copyright treaties. * Although it was not implemented with legislation, the United States entered the Mexico City Convention in 1908. Patents The Act reorganized the United States Patent Office, and strengthened the authority of the Patent Office to determine who would be granted a patent in cases where there was a dispute between the first to invent and the first to file. It also empowered the Patent Office to begin printing, and dropped the requirement that applicants submit two copies of their applications (which had been implemented after multiple conflagrations in the Patent Office destroyed large numbers of patent records). Trademarks Sections 77 through 84 represented the first attempt by the United States of formally recognizing trademarks. Its presence in the Copyright Act lead to significant confusion and confounding of the copyright and trademark concepts. For example, Mark Twain, an author who treated that pseudonym as a brand, began asserting copyright in that pseudonym and sued several people for copyright and trademark infringement, mostly unsuccessfully. Ultimately, the Trade-Mark Cases of 1879 ruled this portion of the law unconstitutional because Congress had used invoked the Copyright Clause as their justification for trademark by including it in the Copyright Act. The Supreme Court determined that was inappropriate because \\"a trade-mark is neither an invention, a discovery, nor a writing, within the meaning of [the Copyright Clause].\\" Congress passed the Trade Mark Act of 1881 to reintroduce trademarks, justified by the Commerce Clause instead.

The work celebrates the imperturbility of the ideal Stoic sage, who with an inner firmness, is strengthened by injury and adversity. Date and addressee The work is addressed to Seneca's friend Annaeus Serenus and written sometime between 47 and 62. De Constantia Sapientis is one of a trio of dialogues addressed to Serenus, which also includes De Tranquillitate Animi and De Otio. The superior position the sage inhabits, of detachment from earthly future events of a detrimental nature, is the unifying theme of the dialogues. Since Serenus is portrayed as not yet a Stoic in De Constantia Sapientis, it is usually considered the earliest of the three dialogues. Content In De Constantia Sapientis Seneca argues that Stoicism is not as harsh as it first appears. Recalling the figure of Cato the Younger Seneca argues that Cato as a wise person suffered neither injury nor insult. Although Serenus objects to this paradox, Seneca provides further analogies to emphasize the impervious nature of the wise person. In chapter 5 Seneca distinguishes between contumelia (insults) and iniuria (injuries). The rest of the treatise through to chapter 19 consists of discussions on the nature of both themes, showing that the wise person is immune from both insults and injuries. Seneca concludes the treatise praising the idea of the wise person while offering practical advice for all of us who are imperfect. References Further reading =Translations= *Elaine Fantham, Harry M.

His Dharma name was My≈çgi (ÊòéÈ≠è).  Biography  Kazan'in Nagachika's year of birth is unknown. He was the son of and the grandson of Kazan'in Morokata. He followed his father and grandfather in serving the emperors of the Southern Court. In 1384 he is supposed to have left the Southern Court capital of Yoshino and gone wandering. His own account in the K≈çun Kuden (which he wrote in 1408) indicates that around 1394 he took up residence in Kyoto. According to the postscript to the K≈çun Senshu, by the first month of Gench≈´ 6 (1389) he had risen to the rank of Naidaijin, but before this time he had already left court. Shortly after this date he entered Buddhist orders. He died in seventh month of Seich≈ç 2 (1429).

The episode was written by David Leslie Johnson and Angela Kang, and directed by Michael E. Satrazemis. Plot In the wake of Daryl's (Norman Reedus) attack on the Sanctuary, Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) again appeals to Eugene (Josh McDermitt) to help; Eugene suggests using their remaining ammunition to clear the walkers, promising to make more afterwards. The walkers are cleared and Negan begins to plot revenge towards Rick's (Andrew Lincoln) allies at Alexandria, the Hilltop, and the Kingdom. Rick is abandoned by Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh) and her Scavengers when they discover the aftermath of Daryl's attack and are fired on by Savior soldiers. Rick is rescued by Carol (Melissa McBride) and Jerry (Cooper Andrews). The three decide to split up to warn the allied communities. Meanwhile, Eugene helps the ill Gabriel (Seth Gilliam) and Dr. Harlan Carson (R. Keith Harris) escape towards the Hilltop, though Eugene fears Gabriel may not make it. Aaron (Ross Marquand) and Enid (Katelyn Nacon) decide to try to make up to the Oceanside community, whose guns they took to fight the Saviors, by bringing them a truck full of alcohol from a nearby brewery. Waiting outside the community at night, Aaron is attacked and Enid shoots his attacker, which turns out to be Natania (Deborah May), the leader of Oceanside. The two are surrounded by other Oceanside members, and Natania's granddaughter Cyndie (Sydney Park) mourns her loss. Simon (Steven Ogg) and one group of Saviors capture Jerry en route to the Hilltop, and use him as a hostage to coerce Maggie (Lauren Cohan) and Jesus (Tom Payne) to turn a convoy of Hilltop soldiers around and return to Hilltop. Simon kills Neil (Karl Funk) as punishment after Maggie agrees. On return to the Hilltop, Maggie executes one of the Savior prisoners, Dean (Adam Fristoe), in retribution, and orders the Hilltop to be fortified. Elsewhere, Gavin (Jayson Warner Smith) leads the Saviors to round up all the residents of the Kingdom, informing them they will be helping to rebuild Sanctuary while the Saviors will be living in the Kingdom until that is completed. Ezekiel (Khary Payton), who had sneaked away, creates a distraction that allows the Kingdom residents to escape into the nearby woods. Carol encounters them, and tries to help Ezekiel, but he locks her out of the Kingdom to face the Saviors alone. Morgan (Lennie James) observes this from a distance. Inside Alexandria, Carl (Chandler Riggs) writes a note to his father. He later prepares to take more food to Siddiq (Avi Nash) when suddenly Negan and many other Saviors seize Alexandria's front gate and assert Alexandria is now theirs. Carl talks to Negan over Alexandria's walls, offering his own life in exchange; however, this is a distraction to allow all the Alexandria residents to escape into the sewers, and to give time for Daryl, Michonne (Danai Gurira), Rosita (Christian Serratos), and Tara (Alanna Masterson) to form a small convoy to burst out of the community's back gates and through a roadblock of Savior vehicles, purposely arranged ineffectively by Dwight (Austin Amelio). The Saviors give chase, but this leads into an ambush set by Daryl. Dwight kills several Saviors in front of Laura (Lindsley Register), and she escapes to warn Negan of his treachery. Dwight joins Daryl and the others as they head to the sewers, though Michonne stays on the surface to look for Carl. Meanwhile, Negan and his Saviors launch fire bombs into the community, destroying several buildings, and break open the front gate and pour into the community, while Carl provides cover through smoke bombs before he escapes to the sewer. Rick eventually arrives, and rushes to his house to look for Michonne, Carl, and Judith, only to find Negan waiting there. They get into a fight, but Rick, severely injured, manages to escape and meets with Michonne. She takes him to the sewer to find all the others waiting there. They find Carl there, who reveals an apparent walker bite on his abdomen. Devastated and stunned, Rick and Michonne comfort Carl as they take in the horror of what must come next. Development \\"How It's Gotta Be\\" features the revelation that the character of Carl Grimes was apparently bitten by a walker in the sixth episode, \\"The King, the Widow, and Rick.\\" Showrunner Scott M. Gimple said that of Carl's bite, it is \\"a one-way ticket.\\" He alluded to the show's next episode, following the mid-season break, that the bite is \\"very important to Carl‚Äôs story and the entire story what happens in the next episode.\\" Carl's pending death deviates significantly from the comic book series, as, at the time of airing, both Carl and Rick were still alive in the comic's published arc, with Carl having a critical role in the Whisperers arc that follows the \\"All Out War\\" narrative. Carl's pending death is considered the largest deviation that the television series has made from the comics to date. Chandler Riggs, who portrays Carl, explained that the decision to kill Carl off was not due his own personal life (at the time, he was taking a year off before entering college) but a choice made by the showrunners to account for a gap in the comic's story. In the comic's \\"All Out War\\" story arc, the war ends with Rick slashing Negan's throat, but then time jumps two years forward to show that Rick had kept Negan alive, although in prison. Riggs said that Gimple felt they needed to make Carl appear as a humanitarian figure in death as to give something for Rick to aspire towards, as to overcome this characterization gap in the comics. Riggs himself only learned of the character's death during the filming of the sixth episode of the season. Reception =Critical reception= \\"How It's Gotta Be\\" received mixed reviews from critics.

The episode was written by Matthew Negrete and Corey Reed, and directed by Larry Teng. Plot Outside the Sanctuary, Daryl (Norman Reedus), Tara (Alanna Masterson), Michonne (Danai Gurira), and Rosita (Christian Serratos) plot to take a garbage truck and ram it through the walls of the compound, thus allowing the walkers presently surrounding the building to flood in and attack the Saviors. As they discuss matters, Morgan (Lennie James) arrives, having overheard their discussion, and offers the support of himself and his group of snipers that are monitoring the Sanctuary under Rick's (Andrew Lincoln) orders. Rosita starts to become concerned about going against Rick's plan and leaves, while Michonne is still unsure if this is the right action, knowing that the situation, as it is, is working to keep the Saviors confined. Inside the Sanctuary, Eugene (Josh McDermitt), who is aware that Dwight (Austin Amelio) is the mole within Negan's (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) ranks that allowed Rick's plan to work, struggles with what action to take. Gabriel (Seth Gilliam), who has been taken prisoner by Negan and held in the infirmary, tries to convince Eugene to do the right thing to help the combined Alexandria, Hilltop, and Kingdom communities. Eugene later meets with Dwight, who warns Eugene that Negan is a terrible person that will attack his friends and that he can help eliminate Negan but only through Eugene's help. Eugene, having gained more confirmation of his suspicions of Dwight's duplicity, swears his loyalty to Negan before leaving. Later, Negan summons Eugene and asks him on the progress he has made to figure out how to rid the walkers around the Sanctuary, and will become second-in-charge should he do so. Eugene comes up with an idea for creating a glider drone with a speaker to lure the walkers away; however, he is forced to locate the coffin that Negan used to take Sasha to Alexandria and find the iPod he had given her before she committed suicide en route, forcing him to relive that memory. With the glider ready to launch, Dwight holds Eugene at gunpoint on the roof, reminding him that Negan will go after Rick and his friends if he goes through with this. Eugene decides to launch anyway, but Dwight shoots the drone down before it can attract the walkers. Just then, Daryl drives the truck into the Sanctuary walls, allowing the walkers to flood the lower floors of the Sanctuary. Many of the workers are killed, but Negan's lieutenants lead an assault to keep the walkers at bay. Eugene, enraged by events, tells Gabriel that he will do what keeps him alive and will remain loyal to Negan. He then goes to see Negan, preparing to inform him that Dwight is the mole, but Dwight and Regina (Traci Dinwiddie) suddenly arrive, causing Eugene to stop short of revealing Dwight's betrayal. He then returns to his room and, amid the constant sound of gunfire, starts to get drunk on wine to try to drown out the noise. Elsewhere, Rick attempts to negotiate his release with Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh) of the Scavengers, but she refuses again and takes photographs of Rick's half-naked body at different angles, intending to use the photos as references for a sculpture she plans to create of him. Afterwards, Rick is brought out from the storage container and led to the center of the junkyard by a Scavenger. He is then forced to his knees, before Jadis presents a lightly armored walker as a method of execution. Able to get the upper hand, Rick threatens Jadis to let him go or die; she lets him go. Rick then makes a deal to allow the Scavengers to share in the spoils from the Saviors if they join him, but Jadis demands to see the situation at the Sanctuary itself before she or her people commit to Rick's plan. The Scavengers are then led by Rick to the outer perimeter of the compound. Walking in, Rick finds one of his snipers dead, being devoured by a small group of walkers. Unable to dispatch with the other snipers, Rick climbs the water tower and observes the area from higher ground. Looking towards the front of the Sanctuary, Rick looks on aghast at the Sanctuary yard, completely devoid of walkers, only to see an abandoned garbage truck and an open door with a giant hole in the compound's wall, alarming him. Reception =Critical reception= \\"Time for After\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 76% with an average rating of 6.25 out of 10, based on 21 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"Time for After\\" improves on TWD's previous episode by focusing on Eugene's emotional struggle. Many critics noted Josh McDermitt's emotional performance, as well as the change of pace from the previous episode, as the episode's highlights. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club graded the episode a B- and said: \\"Rick had a plan; that plan isn't working. We get to see things start to shift before he does, and the final shot of him realizing just how much trouble he's in works, ending the hour on a strong note.\\" Steve Ford of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4 out of 5 stars, saying \\"\\"Time for After\\" put more focus toward a smaller variety of characters. It allowed more time for their stories to build and play out more naturally without feeling rushed. As a result, the episode was all the better for it.\\" =Ratings= The episode averaged a 3.3 rating among adults 18-49, and had a viewership of 7.47 million viewers, which marked a decrease in viewership from the previous week.

Though it was exceptionally aerodynamically clean, it was under-powered and had limited range. Only one was built. Design and development Constructor at the D.1 Cykacz aircraft Jerzy DƒÖbrowski's first aircraft design, produced early in 1924 while he was a student at the Warsaw Technical University, was an unusually clean biplane with an entirely wooden structure. Its one-piece wings were built around two spars and had plywood covered leading edges, with fabric covering elsewhere. The leading edges were straight and unswept out to semi- elliptical tips and the inboard part of the wings had parallel chord inboard but tapered outboard. These outboard regions carried tapered ailerons, though only on the upper wing; ailerons apart, the upper and lower wings were identical. The great majority of biplanes have had upper and lower wings braced together with interplane struts but the Cykacz had none; instead, the fairly thick section wings were cantilevers. The upper wing was supported high over the fuselage on a pair of outward-leaning N-struts with the forward V faired in and the centre of the lower wing was attached to the bottom of the fuselage. There was significant stagger. The Cykacz was powered by a Blackburne Tomtit, an air-cooled V-twin engine. The whole fuselage was a smooth, oval section semi-monocoque structure with wooden frames and ply skin and the engine was in its forward part, though with its cylinders exposed for cooling. The small diameter propeller, designed by Dabrovsky, had a dished spinner that blended into the fuselage's lines. The biplane's single, open cockpit was under the upper trailing edge where there was a cut-out to increase the pilot's field of view. The Cykacz had a conventional empennage with a fin that was integral with the fuselage and ply covered. Its tailplane was, like the wings, in a single piece with a ply-covered leading edge and fabric elsewhere. It was mounted on the top of the fuselage and, together with its separated elevators, was roughly elliptical in plan. Its rudder, which was rounded, low but broad, extended down to the keel. These control surfaces were wooden with fabric covering. Its undercarriage was fixed and conventional, with a track of . A single axle was held on two V-struts from the lower fuselage, with rubber chord shock absorbers. The V-struts had ply fairings and the axle was enclosed within a small lift-giving aerofoil. When first tested, the Cykacz was reluctant to take-off, partly because the Tomtit engine was unreliable and had to be kept below the high output shaft speeds for which the propeller was designed. Babinski took it on its first flight on 26 February 1925. Once off the ground it proved responsive and easy to fly and to land, which it did at low speeds and in short distances. A series of short flights led to some empennage modifications and the fitting of a better-matched propeller enabled the Cykacz to log a total of about forty rather short flights. Its engine remained unreliable and the biplane was both underpowered in flight and of short range. It appeared in an exhibition at the Warsaw Technical University in August 1925 but by 1926 DƒÖbrowski had abandoned it and was working on a new design.

Events While NATO was planning its new strategy, the ceasefire expired, and, as predicted, fighting resumed. As the fighting gradually widened, Bosnian government forces (the ARBiH) launched a large- scale offensive in the area of Sarajevo. In response to the attack, Bosnian Serb forces (the VRS) seized heavy weapons from a UNPROFOR-guarded depot, and began shelling targets. As a retaliation for these actions, the UN commander, Lt. General Rupert Smith requested NATO air strikes. NATO obliged and on 25 and 26 May 1995 bombed a VRS ammunition depot at Pale. The mission was carried out by USAF F-16s and Spanish Air Force EF-18As armed with laser-guided bombs. On 26 May, the Serbs seized 377 UNPROFOR hostages in retaliation and used them as human shields for a variety of targets in Bosnia, forcing NATO to end its strikes. Aftermath Facing a second hostage crisis, General Smith and other top UN commanders began shifting strategies. UNPROFOR began to redeploy its forces to more defensible locations, so that they would be harder to attack or take hostage. More importantly, General Michael Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.

The first woman to participate in documentary filmmaking, she is remembered for her ethnographic short films which explored the diversity of Colombian culture. Winning numerous awards, her work is part of the collection of the Latin American Film Archive at the MOMA in Manhattan. Early life Gabriela Samper Garc√≠a was born on 31 March 1918 in Bogot√°, Colombia to Saturia Garc√≠a Alvarez and Pedro Miguel Samper. Her father was an attorney, originally from Madrid. From a well-to-do family, she was educated at home by her mother and maternal grandmother, Saturia Alvarez de Garc√≠a, who had trained in pedagogy. She also had lessons from Elizabeth Birmingham, her Irish governess. In 1928, she enrolled at the Gimnasio Femenino (Women's Gymnasium) in Bogot√°, graduating in 1936. She traveled throughout Europe before enrolling in Columbia University in New York City to study English literature and take dance courses with Martha Graham. Later she enrolled in dance classes at the Bodenwiser Academy and lived in Trinidad, before returning to Colombia and enrolling in the National University of Colombia, studying philosophy and letters. Career In 1941, Samper received her professorship and married Ulric de Verteuil. She began her career as a teacher of dance, English, and history at the Universidad de los Andes and the Free University of Colombia. During La Violencia, the period between 1948 and 1958 marked by dictatorship and violence in Colombia, Samper was actively involved in the political movements opposed to the conflict and civil unrest. In 1958, she joined the Grupo del B√∫ho, a theater group, and was involved in producing works at the Open Air Theater \\"La Media Torta\\", the Teatro Col√≥n and the Teatro Cultural. She directed performances at the Teatro El Burrito in 1960 and three years later was appointed director of the Cultural Theater of the National Park. In the early years of her career, Samper was involved in children's theater and puppetry, which is what she is most remembered for in her home country. She produce television shows and participated in dance and literary works before turning to film making in 1963. With her third husband, Ray Witlin, Samper founded Cinta Limited, a film production company and the couple made documentary and publicity films in Colombia and the United States. Initially the two produced commercials, but in 1965, Samper wrote and directed El p√°ramo de Cumanday (The Heights of Cumanday), a 22-minute film retelling a Colombian legend shot in the high Andes, as her first artistic film. It explored the fears and struggles of muleteers, fight against the elements and environment. El p√°ramo de Cumanday won the third prize for short films in the 1965 Festival of Puerto Rico. Her ethnographic shorts, focus on the cultural diversity of Colombia. Her Historia de muchos a√±os (History of Many Years, 1965) and Qu√© es Intercol (What is Intercol, 1965), respectively won the Catalina de Oro and a Gold Mention at the VII Festival of Cartagena. She made two films in the United States in 1967, Una m√°scara para ti, una m√°scara para m√≠ (A Mask for You, a Mask for Me) and Ciudades en crisis ¬øqu√© pasa? (Cities in Crisis, What‚Äôs Happening?). Returning to Colombia, in 1969, Samper produced three films: Festival folcl√≥rico de Fomenque (Fomenque Folk Festival), Los sant√≠simos hermanos (The Brotherhood of the Most Hoy), and El hombre de la sal (The Salt Maker). Los sant√≠simos hermanos explores a religious sect which arose in the 1960s in the mountains of the Tolima Department, who reacted to the era's violence by withdrawing and seeking peace through penance. The documentary is preserved in the Museum of Modern Art's Latin American Film Archive in Manhattan. El hombre de la sal was an exploration by Samper of the conflict between traditional artistry and technology. The film won recognition at the Festival de Valencia in Valencia, Venezuela and took the Cruz de M√°lta at the First Latin American Film Festival in C√≥rdoba, Argentina. In 1972, while working as the director of cultural distribution at the Agust√≠n Codazzi Institute, Samper was arrested and charged as a member of the National Liberation Army. Undergoing both physical and psychological torture, she was released after five months in prison, because of a lack of evidence. Leaving the country, she spent the next year and a half studying at Cornell University. Death and legacy Diagnosed with cancer Samper died on 16 May 1974 in Bogot√°. She is seen as one of the pioneering women in Colombian film production, as her ethnographic works inspired Marta Rodr√≠guez, Jorge Silva and Gloria Triana to make films on marginalized populations in Colombia and document cultural traditions. Posthumously, a collection of her short stories, La Guandoca, which relates her experiences as a political prisoner was published. In 2009, the Aurelio Arturo Auditorium of the National Library hosted a cinematographic exhibition of the works of Gabriela and her daughter Mady, also a filmmaker. In 2014, Albeiro P√©rez directed a performance at the Peque√±o Teatro of Gilberto Mart√≠nez's adaptation of La Guandoca for the stage.

Education and early career Ann Rachel Ratner earned a bachelor's degree in 1943 in sociology from Bryn Mawr College. Later in the 1940s, she worked with Gladys L. Palmer in the Department of Industrial Research at the Wharton School; with Palmer she published the 1949 research report Industrial and occupational trends in national employment, 1910-1940, 1910-1948. In the 1950s, she also worked as a statistician for the United States Census Bureau. She married Ervin Miller, and completed her Ph.D. in sociology in 1962 at the University of Pennsylvania. Her dissertation, supervised by Dorothy Swaine Thomas, was State Labor Force Trends and Differentials in the United States from 1870 to 1950. Later career Miller continued working as a researcher in the Population Studies Center of the Wharton School from 1960 to 1971; she was a \\"founding member\\" of the center, and remained associated with it for the rest of her career. In 1971, she was appointed as a research associate professor of sociology in the Wharton School, and in 1972, she was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. By 1980, she had become a regular-rank full professor, and the chair of the Committee on Occupational Classification and Analysis of the National Research Council Assembly of Behavioral and Social Sciences. Miller served as editor-in-chief of the journal Demography from 1985 to 1987. She retired in 1987. Equal pay study In 1981 Miller chaired a committee of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, appointed by president Jimmy Carter, that found that women are \\"systematically underpaid\\", both by being concentrated in lower-paid positions and by being paid less than men for comparable positions. The committee suggested that a notion of \\"comparable worth\\", used to adjudicate legal cases for gender discrimination, could improve the situation, but would not remove disparities caused by discrimination in hiring.

One of the basic thrusts of representation theory is to understand the conditions under which this category is semisimple; i.e., whether an object decomposes into simple objects (see Maschke's theorem for the case of finite groups). The Tannakian formalism gives conditions under which a group G may be recovered from the category of representations of it together with the forgetful functor to the category of vector spaces. The Grothendieck ring of the category of finite-dimensional representations of a group G is called the representation ring of G.  Definitions  Depending on the types of the representations one wants to consider, it is typical to use slightly different definitions. For a finite group and a field , the category of representations of over has * objects: pairs (, ) of vector spaces over and representations of on that vector space * morphisms: equivariant maps * composition: the composition of equivariant maps * identities: the identity function (which is an equivariant map). The category is denoted by operatorname{Rep}_F(G) or operatorname{Rep}(G). For a Lie group, one typically requires the representations to be smooth or admissible. For the case of a Lie algebra, see Lie algebra representation. See also: category O. = The category of modules over the group ring = There is an isomorphism of categories between the category of representations of a group over a field (described above) and the category of modules over the group ring [], denoted []-Mod. = Category-theoretic definition = Every group can be viewed as a category with a single object, where morphisms in this category are the elements of and composition is given by the group operation; so is the automorphism group of the unique object. Given an arbitrary category ', a representation of in ' is a functor from to '. Such a functor sends the unique object to an object say ' in ' and induces a group homomorphism G to operatorname{Aut}(X); see Automorphism group#In category theory for more. For example, a -set is equivalent to a functor from to Set, the category of sets, and a linear representation is equivalent to a functor to Vect, the category of vector spaces over a field . In this setting, the category of linear representations of over is the functor category ‚Üí Vect, which has natural transformations as its morphisms.  Properties  The category of linear representations of a group has a monoidal structure given by the tensor product of representations, which is an important ingredient in Tannaka-Krein duality (see below). Maschke's theorem states that when the characteristic of doesn't divide the order of , the category of representations of over is semisimple.  Restriction and induction  Given a group with a subgroup , there are two fundamental functors between the categories of representations of and (over a fixed field): one is a forgetful functor called the restriction functor : begin{align} operatorname{Res}_H^G : operatorname{Rep}(G) &longrightarrow operatorname{Rep}(H)  pi &longmapsto pi_H end{align} and the other, the induction functor :operatorname{Ind}_H^G : operatorname{Rep}(H) to operatorname{Rep}(G). When and are finite groups, they are adjoint to each other :operatorname{Hom}_G(operatorname{Ind}_H^G W, U) cong operatorname{Hom}_H(W, operatorname{Res}_H^G U), a theorem called Frobenius reciprocity. The basic question is whether the decomposition into irreducible representations (simple objects of the category) behaves under restriction or induction. The question may be attacked for instance by the Mackey theory.  Tannaka-Krein duality  Tannaka‚ÄìKrein duality concerns the interaction of a compact topological group and its category of linear representations. Tannaka's theorem describes the converse passage from the category of finite-dimensional representations of a group back to the group , allowing one to recover the group from its category of representations. Krein's theorem in effect completely characterizes all categories that can arise from a group in this fashion. These concepts can be applied to representations of several different structures, see the main article for details.

The Radium Cruiser was a Russel Brothers tugboat operated on the Mackenzie River system for the \\"Radium Line\\". She was constructed in Owen Sound, Ontario, in 1939, then disassembled and shipped by rail to Waterways, Alberta. Waterways is a river port, and was then the northern terminus of the North American railway grid. Waterways is on the Clearwater River, not far upstream from where the river empties into Lake Athabasca. The waters of Lake Athabasca flow into Great Slave Lake down the Slave River, and then down the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean. A 16 mile series of large rapids at Fort Smith, NWT, on the Slave River, required a long portage. Most of the vessels of the Radium Line were reassembled at waterways, sailed to Fort Smith, then portaged overland to the lower river, and where they could navigate most of the tributaries of the Mackenzie River, and reach the Arctic Ocean without further portages. The Radium Cruiser, like the earlier Radium Queen, was intended to move cargo from the railhead to the Fort Smith portage, and to navigate the Athabasca River, Clearwater River, Peace River and Lake Athabasca and her tributaries. Ice prevents navigation of the Mackenzie River for almost eight months of the year. Like her sister ship, Radium Express, she was smaller than the Radium King and Radium Queen, just long.

Background The long-standing national Militia of the United Kingdom was revived by the Militia Act of 1852, enacted during a period of international tension. As before, units were raised and administered on a county basis, and filled by voluntary enlistment (although conscription by means of the Militia Ballot might be used if the counties failed to meet their quotas). Training was for 56 days on enlistment, then for 21‚Äì28 days per year, during which the men received full army pay. Under the Act, Militia units could be embodied by Royal Proclamation for full-time home defence service in three circumstances:Litchfield, pp. 1‚Äì7.Dunlop, pp. 42‚Äì5.Grierson, pp. 27‚Äì8.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 91‚Äì2. * 1. 'Whenever a state of war exists between Her Majesty and any foreign power'. * 2. 'In all cases of invasion or upon imminent danger thereof'. * 3. 'In all cases of rebellion or insurrection'. The 1852 Act introduced Artillery Militia units in addition to the traditional infantry regiments. Their role was to man coastal defences and fortifications, relieving the Royal Artillery (RA) for active service. History The unit first appeared in the Army List in September 1854 but it was not until December that it was formed with three batteries and its commanding officer appointed. He was Lieutenant-Colonel Evan Morgan, a former officer of The Rocket Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, who had served in the Peninsular War. The new corps' headquarters was established at Swansea. In August 1855 the unit was awarded the privilege of styling itself the Royal Glamorgan Artillery Militia (following the Royal Glamorgan Light Infantry Militia).Litchfield, pp. 91‚Äì3.Army List, various dates. It was reportedArmy and Navy Gazette, 3 January 1857, quoted in Litchfield, p 91. that the unit would be employed exclusively in defending the coast of Glamorgan ‚Äì under the 1852 Act the Militia were liable for service anywhere in the United Kingdom ‚Äì which may explain why it was never embodied during the Crimean War or the Indian Mutiny. After Lt-Col Morgan retired and became the unit's Honorary Colonel, Captain James Simpson Ballard was promoted to commandant, first as Major (21 April 1871), then as Lt-Col (1 January 1875). The Artillery Militia was reorganised into 11 divisions of garrison artillery in 1882, and the Glamorgan unit became the 2nd Brigade, Western Division, RA. By this time the establishment had been increased to four batteries. After another reorganisation in 1889 the title was altered to Glamorgan Artillery (Western Division) RA.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Spiers, Late Victorian Army, pp. 63‚Äì4. From 1902 most units of the Militia artillery formally became part of the Royal Garrison Artillery, the Glamorgan unit taking the title of Glamorgan RGA (M). Embodiments The unit was only embodied for home defence once: * Second Boer War: 1 May to 3 October 1900 Disbandment After the Boer War, the future of the Militia was called into question. There were moves to reform the Auxiliary Forces (Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers) to take their place in the six Army Corps proposed by St John Brodrick as Secretary of State for War. Some batteries of Militia Artillery were to be converted to field artillery. However, little of Brodrick's scheme was carried out.Dunlop, pp. 131‚Äì40, 158-62.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 243‚Äì2, 254. Under the sweeping Haldane Reforms of 1908, the Militia was replaced by the Special Reserve, a semi- professional force whose role was to provide reinforcement drafts for Regular units serving overseas in wartime. Although the Glamorgan RGA (M) transferred to the Special Reserve Royal Field Artillery, all these units were disbanded in March 1909.Dunlop, pp. 270‚Äì2.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 275‚Äì7.Litchfield, Appendix 8.

In 1897 he and several other avant-garde artists ‚Äî notably Ludwig Dill and Arthur Langhammer ‚Äî set up the \\"New Dachau\\" art school in Dachau that attracted artists from all over Europe, especially rural genre painters, landscape painters, and printmakers. Many stayed and formed a colony, drawn both by the picturesque surrounding moors stretching to the distant Alps and by the lower cost of living than in nearby Munich. Among those drawn to the art colony were Fritz von Uhde, Walther Klemm, Gertrud Staats, and Carl Thiemann. The architect Georg Ludwig designed a group of residences for Dachau artists. The new colony achieved national recognition in 1898 when H√∂lzel, Dill, and Langhammer mounted a joint exhibition in Berlin under the title \\"The Dachauer\\". So many artists passed through Dachau during its first fifteen years that certain subjects and views were reproduced repeatedly. One especially popular subject was an old cottage surrounded by ancient poplars, known as the 'Moss Hut' (Moosschwaige). The nearby moorland, called the Dachauer Moos, was another popular subject. The heyday of the colony lasted only until 1914, when many artists left to join the military during World War I and never returned. In addition, new developments in art during the postwar era ‚Äî especially the rise of urban and industrial subjects ‚Äî began to leave Dachau colony artists behind. After World War II, the art colony was nearly forgotten as Dachau became associated in most people's minds above all with the Dachau concentration camp.

Early life She was born Gillian Margaret Sarson, on 3 November 1927 in Multan, in the western Punjab, British India, the daughter of Colonel Edward Vipan Sarson, commandant of the Royal Artillery training centre, and his Norwegian wife, Dagny Sarson. She was educated at the Royal School, Bath, followed by the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London. Career As Gill Sarsen, together with her future husband, Bill Howell, and Stanley Amis, they designed a modernist terrace of six houses at Nos. 80-90 South Hill Park, on the south side of Hampstead Heath, to replace four Victorian houses lost to World War Two bombing. All three were employed by the London County Council's Architect's Department Housing Division, and they ended up living in two of the six houses. Their designs were highly influential and much publicised, and led to them working on the Alton Estate tower blocks in Roehampton. The terrace is now Grade II listed. She later founded her own architectural practice with Jean Elrington. After her husband's early death, she continued teaching at the University of Cambridge school of architecture, and took over her husband's role as a governor of Marlborough College and advisor on its buildings. Personal life She met her future husband, fellow architect Bill Howell on an Architectural Association School outing to the Bryn Mawr rubber factory in Wales. They married on 10 August 1951, and had three sons and one daughter. He died on 29 November 1974 in a car accident near Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, aged 52.

Born in Battersea, in London, as Joan Godfrey, she was brought up in a Catholic family and was educated at a convent school in Norwich. She later attended the National Training College of Domestic Subjects, and then qualified as a domestic science teacher at Westminster College, London. However, she did not become a teacher, instead working as a receptionist, and then as a home adviser for the Gas Light and Coke Company. From 1940, Robins was seconded to the Ministry of Food as a nutritionist. Covering the South West of England, she gave demonstration and radio broadcasts, covering how to make nutritious meals using the rations available during World War II. She was also involved in setting up soup kitchens in areas which had been heavily bombed, such as Coventry and Southampton. Robins returned to the Gas Light and Coke Company in 1947, as its Chief Home Service Adviser; following nationalisation of the industry, she transferred to the North Thames Gas Board. Highly successful at promoting the use of gas appliances, she was given a role with the same title at the Gas Council, and then became head of marketing for British Gas. The Times claimed that she was probably the first woman executive in the gas industry\\". During this period, she hosted frequent television cookery programmes, starting with Housewife in the Kitchen in 1947, then For the Housewife, for which she shared presenting duties with Philip Harben. In 1951, she worked with John Yudkin to present a series on weight loss, then next presented About the Home, which covered a wide variety of household topics, from cookery to clothing and fuel use. These series led to her writing several books, including Common-Sense Slimming and Common-Sense Cooking and Eating. Robins was also interested in women's rights. She regularly appears on Women's Hour, and from 1959 to 1962 was president of the National Council of Women of Great Britain. During her presidency, she called for women to be consulted more widely on government policy, and as a result, the Women's Consultative Council was formed. She also ran a successful campaign against turnstiles being placed at the entrances to women's toilets. In a profile, The Guardian claimed that \\"...she is no crusader about anything, and Joan Robins is so effective precisely because she has neither a sense of mission nor is she didactic. She simply uses common sense\\". Robins was also active in the National Board of Catholic Women, was the founding president of the Institute of Home Economics, and treasurer of the International Council of Women. She was a supporter of the Conservative Party. In the early 1970s, Robins retired to Deddington in Oxfordshire with her husband. She was also made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.

It is roughly bounded by Garden, Ashley, and Woodland Streets on the east, south, and west, and by railroad tracks north of Sargeant Street to the north. The area retains much of its late 19th-century character, with relatively few modern intrusions. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, with small additions in 1983 and 2011. Description and history In the mid-19th century, the area surrounding Hartford's Sigourney Square was occupied by the city's \\"town farm\\", which provided housing, work, and support for its indigent population. This area was hemmed in by road development in the second half of the 19th century, and the farm was reduced in size, and finally shut down in 1896. Only three buildings, modest brick Italianate structures on Ashley Street built about 1850, survive from the town farm period of land use. When the town farm was closed, a portion of it was set aside by the city for use as a public park, which is now known as Sigourney Square Park. Landscaping for the park was developed by J. Alex McClunie, a local landscape architect. Development of pieces of the farm began in 1891, when developer Frederick Mahl built ten Queen Anne houses on Ashley Street. Development was largely complete in the area by 1900. The district covers about , and includes 169 primary buildings. The vast majority of them are wood-frame structures two stories in height, housing either one or two units. Exteriors are generally of wood, brick, or some combination of the two, with Queen Anne Victorian features. There are ten larger apartment blocks, typically housing at least six units, as well as a church and two small commercial buildings. The district has been enlarged twice: the first addition in 1983 added houses on the east side of Garden Street that have been subsequently demolished, and the 2011 addition added 207 Garden Street, a mixed commercial-residential brick block.

History Rendering of Skr√¶dernes Stiftelse at No.18, 1868 In the 1620s a fortification known as Retrenchementet was constructed at the site by Christian IV. In front of the rampart ran a moat known as Rosen√•en. J. W. Heyman og Hustrues Stiftelse The area came under redevelopment in the 1950s. Two large lots adjacent to the planned street Gasv√¶rksvej were sold to carpenter and developer Jensen. He sold them to the trading house Larsen og Co. in 1854. The company wanted an access road directly to Vesterbrogade and the city engineer's office wanted to get rid of Rosen√•en which had developed into an open sewer. Viktoriagade was therefore established on top of the former moat. The land along the street was sold off in lots from 1856. A number of the early buildings in the new street were built as charitable housing complexes. Skr√¶dernes Stiftelse (No. 18) was built for old tailors in circa 1858. J. V. Heymans Stiftelse for officers' widows (No. 19) was founded in 1869 at the initiative of J. V. Heyman.

The Radium Gilbert was a tugboat built for transporting supplies to, and ore from, the radium and uranium mines in Canada's Northwest Territories. Like the other tugs in the Radium Line she was steel-hulled. She was named after Gilbert Labine, the prospector who discovered radioactive ore where Port Radium was built. She was built in Vancouver, in 1946 disassembled, so she could be shipped by rail to Waterways, Alberta. Like all vessels assembled in Waterways that operated on the Mackenzie River, and its tributaries, after she was reassembled she first proceeded downstream to Lake Athabasca, and down the Slave River, to the portage at Fort Smith. Large tractors towed even large cargo overland around large rapids there. The Radium Gilbert spent her operational life 1946 to 1980 on Great Bear Lake. She ran aground near Deline, the small community at the outlet for Great Bear Lake. Her wreck remained radioactive decades after she was used to ship radioactive ore. She was dismantled, and removed, in 2003, after lying grounded, for decades. By that time the population of Deline understood the toxic legacy of the trade in radioactive ore, and the nearby wreck was a painful reminder. In 2005 Atomic Energy of Canada published a study of the toxic legacy of the mining of radioactive ore at Port Radium. According to the report all the other surviving vessels of the Radium line were found to be free of contamination. But the Radium Gilbert was significantly contaminated‚Äîparticularly her showers.

Upon attempting to challenge them, the sheriff is killed by the trio. Meanwhile, the Lonesome Stranger (a burlesque of the Lone Ranger) and his horse, Silver (a caricature of Rochester from the Jack Benny Program) are sitting alone in the hills when an Indian from Western Onion arrives on a scooter and recites a telegram addressed to the duo announcing that \\"the sheriff has been shot\\" to the tune of \\"The Farmer in the Dell\\" before turning to reveal the phrase \\"The Vanishing American\\" on the back of his shirt as he subsequently vanishes. Lonesome takes Silver to the bar riding to town the banditos shoot in the bar. Lonesome uses two guns and one bandito takes them. Lonesome is tied to a barrel of gunpowder. One bandito sets fire to the rope for the explosion. The bandito reads the schedule as three of them go outside to ride their horses. Silver is tied to the stick and the banditos are on their horses. The stagecoach comes with two horses. The Indian from Western Onion arrives again with another telegram for the wrong message.

A. P. Newcomb and Edgar A. P. Newcomb. The majority of his accomplishments were in Boston and Honolulu. Newcomb was also a bass vocalist who composed dozens of songs and at least one opera. Initial success He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 23, 1846, to Levi Newcomb and his wife Sarah Ann. Edgar Allen Poe Newcomb was the nephew of sculptor Thomas Ball. While a student at Ogdensburg Free Academy in New York, he dropped out of school at age 16 to learn the architecture business from his father. The first three decades of his architectural career were with his father's firm L. Newcomb & Son in Boston. He was interested in religious architecture and twice toured Europe visiting the cathedrals. During his association with L. Newcomb & Son, the firm is credited as designing the following (partial listing): *Boston & Lowell Railroad Station (Northern Union Station of Boston) *Memorial Hall at Bowdoin College *Dormitory at Tuft's College *Felton Hall dormitory at Cambridge *First Baptist Church of Portland, Maine *Numerous residences in Buffalo and St. Louis *First Baptist Church, Haverhill, Massachusetts *Sanitarium an Andover, Massachusetts *Hotel Bristol Hawaii He moved to Honolulu in 1901 and joined with Charles William Dickey to form the Dickey & Newcomb firm.

Alexander residence, Bishop St. and Aolani Road *Hale Paahaua, King St. at Punchbowl and Likelike St. *St. Clement's Chapel and Parsonage *P. M. Pond residence, Kamehameha Ave. near McKinley St. *H. Waterhouse residence, 1641 Nuuanu *T. Clive Davies residence, Nuuanu, southeast corner of Judd St. *Judge Humphries residence, Nuuanu, southeast corner of Judd St. The architectural partnership received favorable coverage in the media. Newcomb gave a presentation at the Honolulu YWCA, drawing a correlation between a culture's headwear and its architecture. In 1902, Newcomb returned to New York for what he believed would be a matter of months, to design a home for S. S. Spaulding of Buffalo, New York. He ended up staying almost two years. He returned with his sister Sarah Newcomb, and gave a lengthy interview about the United States interest in Hawaii. A local civic club held its meeting in Newcomb's home in 1904, listening to a presentation of his vision for beautification and improvement of Honolulu. Resuming his practice with Dickey, Newcomb designed the following buildings: *Territorial Normal School, Honolulu *Mrs. Fanny Lane residence, Kewalo and Heulu St., Honolulu *Alfred Hocking House, Kewalo and Wowehi St., Honolulu *C. Du Roi residence, Liliha St. near Wyllie, Honolulu *Wailuku School on Maui In 1905, Newcomb and his sister once again returned to the mainland United States. During his sojourn, he gave an interview to a Manchester, New Hampshire, newspaper, extolling the beauty of Hawaii. Later work Newcomb was selected, along with Edward Lippincott Tilton, to design the Carpenter Memorial Library in Manchester, New Hampshire. The cornerstone was laid in 1913, and the dedication of the building was on November 18, 1914. He designed the Sacred Heart Church-Punahou in Honolulu at 1701 Wilder Avenue in 1914. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Music Newcomb was a bass vocalist who participated in choral performances. He is sometimes listed as E. A. P. Newcomb. He was also known as a musician and songwriter, and sometimes listed as Edgar A. P. Newcomb. In 1891, he wrote the music to \\"Slumber Song\\" and \\"The Sweet Tum Tum\\", words by Arthur Macy. Among his other songs were \\"Hawaii\\" and the hymn \\"Come Unto Me\\". He composed over 50 songs, as well as the opera Betty. Death Following a lengthy illness, Newcomb died November 10, 1923, at the Moana Hotel in Waikiki. His only survivor was his sister Sarah. The Reverend Canon John Usborne officiated over the services at the hotel. Following cremation, Newcomb's ashes were interred at Nuuanu Cemetery.

She used the stage name Eileen Carey. Early life Eileen O'Casey was born Eileen Kathleen Reynolds in Dublin on 27 December 1900. She was the youngest daughter of Athlone accountant Edward Reynolds and his wife Kathleen Reynolds (n√©e Carey), a nurse from County Mayo. Her parents had been married and begun their family in South Africa, where they had two sons, one of whom died in South Africa. The family had returned to Ireland due to the outbreak of the Second Boer War. As a child, the family suffered due to her father's mental health and poor financial choice, which resulted in him losing their Dublin house through gambling. Following this, the family moved to London. In London, O'Casey's remaining brother died. As her father had returned to South Africa, and her mother was working as a live-in nurse, O'Casey was sent to an orphanage boarding school run by the Sisters of Charity. Following a nervous breakdown, her father died. This resulted in some of O'Casey's more wealthy relatives paying for her education in the Ursuline convent, Brentwood, Essex. It was here that she became interested in choral singing and theatre. A severe illness resulted in O'Casey withdrawing from schooling. Once she had recovered, she took up employment as a tracer within a number of London firms while taking singing and dancing lessons. O'Casey had her first professional performances in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1923 and 1924. She took her mother's maiden name as a stage name, and performed in musical comedy in England and America and modelled under the name Eileen Carey from 1925 to 1926. Career and family life Having read Sean O'Casey's Juno and the Paycock, she developed an obsessive need to meet the author. Upon her return to London from New York, she arranged an introduction to him. She was 17 years his junior, and he immediately invited her to take the role of Nora Clitheroe in The Plough and the Stars for its first London production. In this role she replaced the original actress who had fallen ill after three weeks. While Eileen was continuing an affair with the married American theatre impresario Lee Ephraim, Sean began to court her doggedly. Eileen appeared in her second role in an O'Casey play in June 1927, playing Minnie Powell in the West End production of The Shadow of a Gunman. It was produced as a double bill with John Millington Synge's Riders to the Sea, in which she played a keener. The O'Caseys married on 23 September 1927 in the Catholic church of All Souls and the Redeemer in Chelsea. Their first child was born in April 1928. O'Casey continued her acting career, appearing in No√´l Coward's Bitter Sweet, then in The Miracle by Max Reinhardt. Her final stage role was in the 1932 musical Mother of Pearl, then she retired. The couple had two sons and one daughter: Breon born 1928, Niall born 1935, and Shivaun born 1939. Niall died of leukaemia in 1956. The couple were known for their wide circle of friends that included writers, artists, actors, politicians, and aristocrats. They lived in London and Buckinghamshire, before moving to Totnes (1938-1954) and then Torquay (1954-1964). During their time in Devon, O'Casey helped to care for her aging mother, although the relationship was never easy. She was noted for having provided O'Casey with \\"one of the most contented home lives in literary history\\", supporting the family through periods of financial difficulties and her husband's blindness in later life. Later life Following the death of her husband in 1964, O'Casey lived in D√∫n Laoghaire for a few years. She then moved back to London, visiting Dublin and New York frequently as she wrote and lectured on her life with O'Casey. She authored three books: Sean (1971), Eileen (1976), and Cheerio, Titan (1991). O'Casey died at Denville Hall home for retired actors in London on 9 April 1995. She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, with her ashes scattered at the same place as her husband's.

In the summers, she returned to South America, performing in various theaters in Buenos Aires, as well as performing in Ecuador, Montevideo and in Brazil at the 400th anniversary of the founding of Rio de Janeiro, or toured in Europe. Itelman performed in England, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the USSR. She remained at Bard as the Director of the dance department until 1969, when she returned to Buenos Aires. In 1970, Itelman founded the Caf√© Estudio de Teatro Danza and began developing both creative and educational aspects of dance theater. She staged \\"Alicia en el pa√≠s de las Maravillas\\" as her first production. Her studio is now the home of the Choreographic Workshop at the San Mart√≠n Theater. Between 1977 and her death, she created choreographies of works which have become iconic pieces for the Workshop, including: El capote (The cloak), Historia del soldado (History of the soldier), Las casas de Colomba (The houses of Colomba, inspired by Tennessee Williams's iconic play A Streetcar Named Desire), Paralelo al horizonte (Parallel to the horizon), Suite de percal (Suite of percale) and Y ella lo visitaba (And she visited it). Death and legacy Itelman committed suicide on 16 September 1989 in Buenos Aires. That same year, she was honored with the Konex Award for choreography. On the tenth anniversary of her death, a tribute to her choreography was held at the Ana Itelman Salon on Guardia Vieja in Buenos Aires. Rub√©n Szuchmacher released Archivo Itelman in 2002, a biography of Itelman's career and artistic trajectory which chronicled her impact on modern dance in Argentina.

These units were usually made up of male non-Jewish prisoners‚Äîmost were Poles or Soviets. Chances of survival were higher in these mobile units than the main camps they were attached to. The deployment of the Baubrigaden to major cities within the German Reich was the first time the German public became aware of the living conditions in concentration camps. By the end of the war there were 13 Baubridgaden made up of around 9,500 prisoners. There were around 1,000 prisoners in each Baubrigaden and it is estimated that at least 17,000 male prisoners were part of the Baubrigaden system between 1942 and 1945. The Baubrigaden were mostly made up of prisoners from Buchenwald, Neuengamme and Sachsenhausen, while the SS-Eisenbahnbaubrigaden were mainly from Auschwitz and Dachau. The proposal to form mobile labor units was first floated by Hans Kammler in 1942 in a paper called Vorschlag fur die Aufstellung von SS-Baubrigaden (\\"Suggestions for the Establishment of SS Construction\\"). In the paper he estimated that Heinrich Himmler's Friedenshauprogramm in the East‚Äîwhich called for the construction of settlements, camps and supply depots in the newly conquered territories‚Äîwould require \\"a construction volume of between 20 and 30 billion Reichmark\\" and 175,000 prisoners. Under Kammler's proposal, these prisoners would have formed 4,800 man labor detachments that could move between construction sites. These plans had to be revised in 1942 when the German armaments industry began to demand more labor. As fighting intensified in 1942, Himmler ordered that the SS-Baubrigaden be deployed to clean up German cities that had been destroyed in the British bombing campaign. Albert Speer, who was Reich Minister for Armament and Munitions, was closely involved with the Baubrigaden. In September 1942 Baubrigaden were deployed to Bremen, Osnabr√ºck, D√ºsseldorf, Duisburg and Cologne to construct emergency shelters and clear rubble in the aftermath of bombings. They also had to recover dead bodies from the rubble and recover unexploded bombs. Though working conditions were poor, chances of survival were higher in the Baubrigaden subcamps because prisoners were more likely to find food. By 1943, the Reich Ministry of Armaments and War Production determined that the diversion of workers to cleanup efforts was hurting armaments production.

Its English translation is attributed to Filipino Indologist Juan R. Francisco, assisted by Maranao scholar Nagasura Madale, based on Francisco's ethnographic research in the Lake Lanao area in the late 1960s. It narrates the adventures of the monkey-king, Maharadia Lawana, whom the Gods have gifted with immortality. Francisco first heard the poem being sung by Maranao bards around Lake Lanao in 1968. He then sought the help of Maranao scholar Nagasura Madale, resulting in a rhyming English translation of the epic. Francisco believed that the Ramayana narrative arrived in the Philippines some time between the 17th to 19th centuries, via interactions with Javanese and Malaysian cultures which traded extensively with India. By the time it was documented in the 1960s, the character names, place names, and the precise episodes and events in Maharadia Lawana's narrative already had some notable differences from those of the Ramayana. Francisco believed that this was a sign of \\"indigenization\\", and suggested that some changes had already been introduced in Malaysia and Java even before the story was heard by the Maranao, and that upon reaching the Maranao homeland, the story was \\"further indigenized to suit Philippine cultural perspectives and orientations.\\"  See also  *Darangen *Ramayana *Maranao people *Juan R.

The videos follow protagonist \\"Paul\\" exploring and documenting a supposedly long-lost PlayStation 1 video game, titled Petscop. Paul soon discovers that the game may be linked to his own past. The 24-episode series ran from March 12, 2017 to September 2, 2019. The series received widespread coverage for its elaborate storytelling, authenticity, surrealism, and its active community of viewers.  Plot summary  The main character, Paul, has found or received a copy of the titular unreleased game Petscop, uploading recordings of its early levels. Initially, the game has a vibrant and cute aesthetic, centering around the player character - named the \\"Guardian\\"  capturing strange creatures known as \\"pets\\" by solving puzzles. Paul remarks on the unfinished nature of the game and its lack of playable content. The first four episodes are recorded by Paul for a specific, unnamed, person. Later, Paul acknowledges that his recordings have found an audience on YouTube, though he still narrates directly to the unseen character, and occasionally speaks to them on the phone. The game box, however, came attached with a note containing a code and instructions. By following these, Paul is able to access a darker, surreal, hidden section of the game. The new area, known as the \\"Newmaker Plane\\", is a vast grassy field, pitch dark except for a spotlight following the Guardian. The field has sparse landmarks, and a large network of tunnels and underground chambers. The area still loosely follows conventions of puzzle games, and Paul attempts to reverse engineer the puzzles (and the internal logic of the game) to continue progressing. As Paul finds more content, it is slowly revealed - through references to 'real-world' events and characters - that Petscop was designed for a specific person who did something horrible. The series' overarching plot involves a man named Marvin, the disappearance of his childhood friend Lina, and an incident in which Marvin kidnaps his own daughter, Care, who he believes to be Lina reborn. There is a recurring focus on \\"rebirthing\\", a failed attempt to rebirth a girl named Belle into a girl named Tiara, and a growing connection between Paul, his family's past, and the game. It is later implied that some footage is not from Paul's perspective, introducing new viewpoints from Belle and Marvin, who are all playing Petscop simultaneously. Marvin solicits Paul's help to find landmarks on the Newmaker Plane, and re-enact the process of rebirthing his daughter, Care. Later, Paul realizes that the landmarks on the Newmaker Plane may have significance to real-life locations; after presumably traveling to one of the real landmarks, Paul is not heard from again, though his videos continue to be uploaded without narration. The series uses its YouTube medium to deliberately omit critical information. As a result, it has few concrete details, and ends without a definitive explanation for the game or Paul's connection to it. In the finale, Paul breaks Care's rebirthing cycle, spiting Marvin. Belle, who is implied to have been the unseen character, finds Paul, asking him if he remembers being \\"born\\"; when they were both smuggled away as children by Lina. Paul embraces Belle as family, and they enter Lina's skirt.  Characters  = Inside the game = * Guardian or Newmaker ‚Äì The player character that Paul controls. It is a green animal- like creature of an unknown species. * Tool ‚Äì A large red object that the player can ask questions to, though it usually responds with \\"I don't know\\". It is found under the Newmaker Plane. * Marvin ‚Äì Marvin exists as a character in the game, and as a person mentioned in real life. Presumably, the real Marvin is playing the game as his avatar. Paul identifies him as the strange green-faced creature in \\"Petscop 8\\". He is the father of Care, and kidnapped her in 1997 to perform rebirthing. Marvin appears occasionally to assist Paul, and they learn to communicate in an esoteric Dualshock controller language. In certain recordings, Marvin is seen playing sections of the game which specifically address him, implying the game was made for Marvin to find. Marvin later turns on Paul, and somehow hurts him physically in \\"Petscop 15\\". * Carrie Mark (Care) ‚Äì Care is depicted in the game, and is mentioned to have existed in real life. She was abducted for a period in 1997 before returning - what happened in the interim is unknown, as is what happened afterwards. In the game, she is considered a \\"pet\\" and is caught under the Newmaker Plane. She exists in three different states: A (before her kidnapping), B (during her captivity) and NLM (\\"Nobody Loves Me\\", after escaping). A fourth state exists, depicted as a literal Easter egg, after her failed \\"rebirthing\\" attempt. She is depicted only as a static item. * Michael Hammond (Mike) ‚Äì A seven-year-old boy who lived from 1988 to 1995. His tombstone is found by Paul in the game, and he is later implied to be Rainer's brother, making him the cousin of Care. The circumstances of his death are unknown, but it is implied that Petscop was originally created to be his birthday gift. * Lina Leskowitz - Carrie's aunt, who went missing as a girl in 1977 - along with an entire windmill, which vanished behind her. Marvin saw this happen, and later believed that Lina was \\"reborn\\" into his daughter, Care. Lina is thanked for \\"making (the game) possible\\", and is referred to as \\"boss\\"; the series ends with Paul and Belle walking into her. It is repeatedly said that \\"not everyone\\" can see her.  Pets  * Randice ‚Äì A flower who exists in a symbiotic relationship with Wavey. * Toneth ‚Äì A pet shown in a painting alongside Randice. Only found on the Newmaker Plane, he is a bird who has apparently broken his leg in a car accident. * Wavey ‚Äì A cloud who waters Randice to keep him alive. * Amber ‚Äì A large sentient steel ball who enjoys staying in her cage. * Pen ‚Äì A musically gifted pet, a \\"deaf\\" mathematician. * Roneth ‚Äì Toneth's baby half-brother. The method of catching him is retroactively revealed in the Newmaker Plane, in a series of puzzles that mimic the Pets. * Hudson - A spherical, robotic pet appearing in \\"Petscop 18\\" as presumably cut concept art. = Outside of the game = * Paul ‚Äì Identified as such only due to naming his save file, Paul is quiet and investigative. Nothing is definitively known about his connection to the family, other than his recognition of some events, and his desire to uncover the secrets of the game. There are several parallels between him and Care - he mentions that they look alike and share the same birthday - implying a surrealistic connection between the two. As Care never appears in the story, it is speculated that they are somehow the same person. Near the end of the series, there are several references to Paul being under some form of surveillance, or being in captivity. * Belle (a.k.a. Tiara Leskowitz) ‚Äì Throughout the series, Paul addresses a specific person, even in its first line: \\"This is just to prove to you that I‚Äôm not lying about this game I found.\\" In \\"Petscop 22\\", Paul refers to this person as \\"Belle\\". A person named Tiara, first mentioned by the Tool and in a note in \\"Petscop 5\\", is depicted as an in-game character. Later in the series, the character insists her real name is Belle. In the series epilogue, Belle asks Paul if he remembers being \\"born\\"; when they were \\"smuggled away\\" by Lina, implying a family relationship. * Rainer ‚Äì Presumably a nickname for Care's cousin, Daniel Hammond. Rainer is or was the lead developer of Petscop, and his motives for creating the game are unclear. Some elements of the game are intended for Marvin to see, and to uncover the mystery of where he took Care. Rainer had somehow been in contact with Paul in his childhood, and may have been the person to give him Petscop. * Anna - The wife of Marvin and mother of Care. * Jill - The owner of the channel and Care's aunt, apparently a suspicious figure according to Paul.  Reception  Petscop has received coverage from many news sources, such as The New Yorker and Kotaku: Kotakus Patricia Hernandez wrote \\"if this is an internet story / game, then I am in awe of how elaborate it is\\", and for The New Yorkers Alex Barron, it is \\"the king of creepypasta\\". The series' popularity was largely cultivated by its coverage by several popular YouTubers, such as Pyrocynical and The Game Theorists. The Petscop channel, as of 2020, had over 350,000 subscribers. = Interpretations and cultural links = Petscop, as a video game, is fictional, although this was obscured for the entire run of the series. Some viewers were initially unsure as to whether \\"Paul\\" and Petscop were real, until far into the series when it became more surrealistic. Petscop was not officially identified as fiction until after the finale, when creator Tony Domenico - who had remained anonymous for the series' 30-month run - revealed himself on Twitter. In his only interview, Domenico admitted that, while there is a concrete plot tying the story together, he chose to omit most of it, sometimes scrapping footage that was already done. \\"I hoped to get across a feeling like there‚Äôs ... something strange and complex happening in the background, and you just aren‚Äôt getting a full view of it.\\" In the darker sections of the game, there are many references to child abuse, childhood trauma, and irreparable corruption, making those recurring motifs throughout the series. In addition to these themes, Domenico has cited the Marble Hornets and Ben Drowned web series as influences, involving the audience by hiding things in each video. He also named the 2006 David Lynch experimental film Inland Empire as the strongest influence for the series, and noted that \\"too much is lost in that translation into words\\". The series also includes allusions to Candace Newmaker and her death in rebirthing therapy. Throughout the series, the word \\"Newmaker\\" appears several times; the name of the central location, and as a title given to Rainer, the Guardian character, and/or Paul himself. In addition, there is an area known as the \\"Quitter's Room\\", the repeated question \\"Do you remember being born?\\", and a character named Tiara. Domenico has stated that while the references were intentional, he later regretted them. Other references include a quote from the book Daisy-Head Mayzie by Dr. Seuss, and the imagery of the character Care crying underneath a large flower, which at first appears to be growing from her head.

It is the largest of three lakes in the county called \\"Bass Lake\\" (the other two are located in Interlochen and Forest Lakes). It is naturally separated into two unequal sections, with a strait connecting the two. The northern section is simply known as Bass Lake, but the southern portion is occasionally known as Beitner Lake or Mulberry Lake. The lake is wedged between Long Lake to the west and Silver Lake to the east, both of which are bigger than Bass Lake. The west branch of Beitner Creek flows out of the lake and into the Boardman River. The nearest towns are Grawn and Traverse City. A small settlement called Bass Lake sits on the eastern shore of the lake, at the end of Culver Road. Most of the lake is located within Long Lake Township, but the southern portion of the lake extends into Green Lake Township.  Camp  Until 1955, Girl Scouts who wanted to camp had to go to Camp Greilick near Arbutus Lake, which was owned by the Boy Scouts (who also outed there). In the summer of that year, a girls scout camp opened on the southwestern shore of the lake known as Camp Sakakawea.  Recreation  In the local area, Bass Lake is used for recreation. It is known locally is a common pike, bluegill and bass fishing lake (hence the name). Boaters on the lake, who commonly water ski on the lake, also visit Long and Darien islands, which are the largest islands in the lake. Boaters access the lake on the northwest shore. People who live on the lake commonly own smaller cabin houses. Many small hotels are on the lake.

The privilege protects the results of companies' internal environmental compliance audits from disclosure at trial, or in pretrial discovery. The environmental audit privilege is meant to incentivize companies to evaluate their own compliance with environmental regulations. Proponents of such laws further argue that it is necessary to encourage such self-evaluations, because regulatory agencies lack the resources to police all the polluters in their jurisdiction. Environmental audit privilege statutes have been promoted by the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, which circulates a model statute known as the \\"Uniform State Environmental Audit Privilege Act\\". However, most state environmental privilege laws are non-uniform, and vary greatly in their scope, exceptions and effect. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has been skeptical of state environmental audit privilege laws, and generally requires that states limit the privilege's effect so as not to interfere with federal investigations. These concerns were heightened by the question of whether these laws would apply to state government agencies to which the EPA delegated its enforcement authority under federal law. Accordingly, in the past, the EPA has used its statutory powers in the delegation of EPA enforcement authority to discourage states from adopting excessively powerful environmental audit privilege laws. Some states do not recognize environmental audit privilege, but do provide immunity from civil penalties for the results of internal compliance audits. These states include Minnesota, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.

It has a single tubular leaf and up to forty flowers with red and green colouring and grows in sandhills near the sea. Description Prasophyllum litorale is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf up to long and wide. Between fifteen and forty scented flowers are crowded along flowering stem which reaches to a height of . The flowers variously are coloured red and green and as with others in the genus, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The ovary is oval-shaped to round and about long. The dorsal sepal is egg- shaped to lance-shaped, green with a central reddish stripe, long, wide, dished and held more or less horizontally. The lateral sepals are lance- shaped, long, about wide and free from each other. The petals are oblong, about long, wide and pink or reddish-brown with pale edges. The labellum is pink to creamy-white, long, wide and turns upwards with the tip extending above the lateral sepals. There is a short, thick, channelled yellowish-green callus in the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs in December and January but the flowers are relatively short-lived. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum litorale was first formally described in 1990 by Robert John Bates and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens from a specimen collected near Portland. The specific epithet (litorale) is a Latin word meaning \\"of the seashore\\", referring to the apparently restricted habitat of this orchid.

It was created as part of the Whitlam Governments' National Growth Centre project in an effort to decentralise the population, the corporation role was to manage and develop land with the aim to grow the Albury-Wodonga region to 300,000 people by the year 2000. The corporation had a unique tripartite legal structure in that there existed three statutory corporations ‚Äì one belonging to the Commonwealth (Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation), one belonging to Victoria (Albury- Wodonga (Victoria) Corporation) and one to New South Wales (Albury-Wodonga (New South Wales) Corporation). The three corporations were legally distinct, but in practice acted as a single entity. History In 1972 the Whitlam Federal Labor government selected the cross-border towns of Albury (New South Wales) and Wodonga (Victoria) to form the Albury-Wodonga Growth Centre. The Albury-Wodonga Corporation, a Commonwealth statutory authority, was established by the Albury-Wodonga Development Act 1973. The role of the corporation was originally as a land developer within the Albury-Wodonga region. The National Growth Centre project officially ended in 1995, but the corporation continued to function. However, in 2004 the corporation ceased development activities at which time it owned 6,500 hectares. It then became the corporation's responsibility to dispose of property assets and provide a financial return to the government in preparation for its abolition. It was decided in 1995 to wind up the corporation. It was agreed in February 1997 that the wind-up would be phased, with the state corporations to be abolished first (their assets passing to the federal corporation upon abolition), with the federal corporation to be abolished subsequently. The NSW state corporation was abolished on 26 September 2003 as provided for by the Albury- Wodonga Development Repeal Act 2000 (Act No.18, 2000). The abolition of the Victorian state corporation was effected by the Albury-Wodonga Agreement (Repeal) Act 2003 (No. 62 of 2003). In July 2014, the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation (Abolition) Act 2014 was passed by the Commonwealth parliament and the wind up of the federal corporation began.

Mostly an oral language before the mid-nineteenth century, the Ga language assumed a written form as a result of his literary work. Zimmerman's work built upon the single introductory grammatical treatise written by the Euro-African Moravian missionary and educator, Christian Jacob Protten, in the Ga and Fante languages, and published a century earlier in Copenhagen, in 1764.  Early life and education  Johannes Zimmermann was born on 2 March 1825 on Kirchstra√üe 5 (5 Church Street) in the town of Gerlingen, Germany. Born into a family of farmers, he was the oldest of five children. Deeply religious, Zimmermann‚Äôs pietistic family had compulsory \\"devotional hours\\" several times a week. His grandfather owned a restaurant, which became a meeting place for the pietistic communities from Gerlingen and surrounding villages. As a pupil, Johannes Zimmermann‚Äôs views were shaped by the apocalyptic zeal of a troubled religious period. While still a boy, the pietistic fervour motivated him to become a missionary in Africa after leaving school. After school, he joined a trade apprenticeship in carpentry and also started occupational training to become a baker. After he finished his apprenticeship, he walked on foot to Basel, Switzerland with the aim of training as a missionary. On 17 of August 1844, Johannes Zimmermann arrived in Basel to begin his six-year missionary training at the Basel Mission Seminary (Basler Missionseminar). At the seminary, he began studying the G√£ language because he was drawn to a call to become missionary on the Gold Coast. On 9 December 1849, Johannes Zimmermann was ordained by the missionary superintendent, the Rev. Kapf in Herrenberg, a town in the middle of Baden- W√ºrttemberg, about 30 km south of Stuttgart in Germany. A week later he bade farewell to his hometown Gerlingen and set off to a new journey as a missionary on the Gold Coast. According to the German church historian, Paul Steiner, in his Zimmermann biography, \\"When Zimmermann stepped then into the pulpit of the old venerable church, then this whole house of God was filled with sitting and standing people. While he did his farewell speech, he was often interrupted by the sobbing of the parish, and when he spoke to the persons of his age and former mates, then even the tough, rough farm youth cried like children.\\"  Missionary activities on the Gold Coast  = Osu and Abokobi = Upon his arrival on the Gold Coast in 1850, Johannes Zimmermann, then twenty-five years old, was first stationed in Christiansborg, now the suburb of Osu in Accra, where he taught at the all boys' middle boarding school, Salem School, Osu In 1852, he started and taught at the small catechist seminary, the Basel Mission Seminary in Christiansborg, Osu which was eventually absorbed into its counterpart at Akropong, the Presbyterian College of Education. His first impression of Accra was the presence of the former slave forts, the Christiansborg Castle and Ussher Fort ‚Äì a stark reminder of a distant dark past. The sight of these landmarks influences Zimmermann‚Äôs theology leading him to speak against slavery and exploitation for the rest of his life. A few months after his arrival, Zimmermann fell ill with a tropical ailment, then dubbed, ‚ÄúAfrica fever‚Äù. His options were imminent death or an immediate return home\\". Choosing a more unorthodox alternative for a European missionary at the time, he sought treatment at the shrine of a native healer or shaman. He regained his health quickly and became fully acclimatized to the domestic environment. After the 1854 bombardment of Christiansborg by the H. M. S. Scourge, following the riots against the British poll tax ordinance, Zimmermann was forced to move with his family, his students, and some members of the Christian community to the more interior Abokobi, about 15 miles (24 kilometres) from Accra, where, with the assistance of another missionary, August Steinhauser, he set up a small Christian community‚Äîa step from the European characterized lifestyle to the original African life. Before the evacuation, Zimmermann and his family had sought refuge at the Methodist mission house in Accra. At Abokobi, Zimmermann did intensive language studies and translations. In 1857, under the guidance of Zimmermann, a local fetish priest at Abokobi, Paulo Mohenu converted to Christianity which was considered a great achievement at the time. He also had dreams of building a German community as a way to solve the social problems of Germany by emigration to Africa to farm on the vast swathes of virgin or fallow lands at Abokobi. Between 1858 and 1859, Johannes Zimmerman was transferred back to Christiansborg to replace another missionary who had died in the preceding year. = Kroboland = In 1855, Zimmerman and the Rev. C. W. Locher traveled as far as Odumase in the state of Krobo, 50 miles (80 km) northeast of the Ghanaian capital, Accra, where they were warmly welcomed by the paramount chief, Odonkor Azu, who entrusted one of his sons, Tei, to them to be educated and brought up as a Christian. In 1859, he was transferred to Odumase-Krobo to open a new mission station there and where he lays the foundation for his work on the Gold Coast. As he had visited the place before, he did not face many challenges. He was accompanied by two of his former pupils, Carl Christian Reindorf, and Christian Obuobi, and worked in the Krobo area until 1872. His plans included setting up a Euro-African settlement to ‚Äúmaximize utilization of mineral resources, progressive agriculture, increasing export of goods, to improve people's living conditions.‚Äù He noted that in spite of demographic and linguistic differences, rural German and the traditional Gold Coast cultures were analogous with regards to communal lifestyles, farming and craftsmanship, adding that \\"Africa needs Germans. We are a continental people who traditionally earn a living by farming and the old crafts\\" Johannes Zimmermann built his mission house in the village of Odumase, the hub of the Kingdom Manya-Krobo where he saw himself as an \\"ambassador of Jesus\\". The tribal chieftain, King Odonkor Azu, is open- minded and supportive of the Christian mission. As a sign of his friendship with Zimmermann, the Krobo paramount chief instructed his subjects to carve a stool from a special piece of wood. The chief‚Äôs son, Tei, moved in with the Zimmermann family. The king anointed Johannes Zimmermann, ‚ÄúTeits…õ‚Äù meaning the \\"father of the king's son Tei\\". At the end of 1869, ten years after Zimmermann's arrival in Odumase, the Christian parish had grown to about a hundred members. The mission house was open to everyone living in Manya-Krobo and neighbouring villages. Overall, Johannes Zimmermann worked for 12 years in the kingdom of Manya-Krobo. Missionary Bohner recounted in his diary after a visit to Rebmann in Odumase, Kroboland: \\"He has put up his house ... into the middle of the [natives'] village ... The house is like a [native's] hut, covered with steppe grass. But the white coating from muschelkalk, the dark- brown shutters from solid wood of the African oak, the light glass windows and the galleries around the building tell someone who lives here.\\"  Contributions to Ga-Dangme literature  Zimmermann's greatest contribution to the Gold Coast was in the field of Ga-Dangme literature. In his work in education at Christiansborg, both in the catechist seminary as well as in the boys' school, he emphasised the teaching of the vernacular, Ga language. From the very beginning, Zimmermann started collecting Ga words and terms, later to be published in his dictionary. Within the Christian ministry and catechism, he translated the Bible and 500 hymns (300 of which were his own compositions) into the G√£ language, and also penned several poems. According to scholars, he was ‚Äúdeeply influenced by the sociohistorical theories of Johann Gottfried Herder (1744‚Äì1803), whose views on the life cycle of communities and on the equality of different cultures was opposed to the historical conception of the Enlightenment, which considered Western civilization as superior to other cultures and as the ideal and goal toward which other cultures did or should aspire‚Äù = Selected works = The following publications are some of Zimmermann's literary works: * Zimmermann, J.

London  Personal life  Catherine Mulgrave In June 1851, Johannes Zimmermann married Catherine Mulgrave, an Afro-Jamaican divorced woman who was teaching in the girls' school at Christiansborg. The Basel Mission Society was shocked by this marriage because Zimmermann had not asked for permission from the Home Committee. Facing possible dismissal from the Basel Mission for marrying a divorced African woman, Zimmermann remarked in defiance, \\"I am marrying Africa...well, the African liana has climbed the German oak tree.\\" As punishment, the Home Committee, suspended Zimmermann, stripping him of his rights to travel home to Europe every year on furlough, effectively making him a local missionary on the Gold Coast for the next twenty-two years. Mulgrave was born in Angola but raised in Jamaica after being rescued as a six-year old from Portuguese slave traders who had kidnapped her. They brought her onto a slave ship from Africa to Jamaica. Near the coast of Jamaica, the ship got in distress and sank. Catherine Mulgrave was however rescued from the wreckage. She recalled her mother calling her by the Angolan name ‚ÄúGewe‚Äù as a child and was adopted by the then Governor of Jamaica, Earl of Mulgrave and his wife, Lady Mulgrave who educated her at the Female Refuge School followed by teacher training at the Mico Institution in Kingston, Jamaica. Mulgrave had earlier been married to the Americo-Liberian, George Peter Thompson who had been educated in Basel Mission training school in Basel, Switzerland as a mission assistant. In 1843, the young couple emigrated to the Gold Coast with a group of Jamaican missionaries from Kingston. Thompson and Mulgrave however got divorced six years later. Zimmermann and Mulgrave made the Gold Coast their home. Five of their six children lived to adulthood: two daughters and three sons. His dream of creating a German-African settlement in Abokobi never materialised although his descendants still live in Ghana. Furthermore, his own children and youngest brother, Christoph also married African spouses, indicating that his family was acclimated to the indigenous environment.  Later life and death  Failing health and exhaustion made him leave for Europe to recuperate for a year. On his return, he lived and worked at Abokobi until 1876, when he returned to Christiansborg. Shortly after this, he fell ill again, and returned to his hometown, Gerlingen with his wife, Catherine via Basel in September 1876, where he died at the end of the same year, on 13 of December 1876 at the age of fifty-one. Catherine, his wife, returned to the Gold Coast in the spring of 1877 and lived at Christiansborg until her death, fourteen years later, in 1891. For the last months of his life, he stayed in Gerlingen. It was his ultimate wish to be brought into the house of his fathers. His last words were: \\"Water of life! Oh, how much I want to drink.\\" He was buried in a graveyard in Gerlingen  Legacy and memorials  Zimmerman‚Äôs legacy is tied to his mission work in Kroboland where he is held in high esteem. He forged links with the locals and was seen as a \\"bridge between people and cultures\\", built on strong foundations. Johannes Zimmermann's areas of operations, the Manya-Krobo and Yilo-Krobo Traditional Areas are located in southeastern Ghana covering 750 square kilometres with a population of approximately 250, 000 inhabitants. What started with Zimmermann has been continued with cultural exchange over the years: There is an alliance between Kroboland and Gerlingen with delegations. The Zimmermann Presbyterian Cemetery in Accra was named in his memory. In 1970, the then Synod Clerk of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana, the Rev. Albert L. Kwansa visited Gerlingen to search for information about background, youth and surrounding of the missionary Johannes Zimmermann, who in nowadays Ghana very much honoured in the oral tradition of Kroboland's history. In 1972, the Mayor of Gerlingen, Wilhelm Eberhard travelled with an official delegation to Zimmermann's sphere of activity in Ghana. Later on in his retirement, Mayor Eberhard stated, \\"It is unbelievable how people in Ghana talk nowadays still full of respect and gratitude to Johannes Zimmermann and his beneficial life's work. Whoever we met - not only the members of the hosting church, also political personalities - pay tribute to the good deeds which Zimmermann did from 1850 to 1876 and which are still in use to see. Seen from the angle that he had to deal with the conceivable most difficult conditions, it's all the more admirable.\\" In 1976, the king from Manya Krobo, Nene Azzu Mate Kole II came to Gerlingen. He is one of the well-known tribal chieftains of Ghana. Together with inhabitants of Gerlingen he unveiled the commemorative plaque for Zimmermann in front of Petruskirche (St. Peter's Church) and presented the \\"Zimmermann chair\\" as a gift to the town of Gerlingen. In 1989, Nene Azzu Mate Kole II invited the then Mayor of Gerlingen, Sellner together with a delegation to his golden jubilee celebration of enstoolment and ascension to the throne in Ghana. There is a street in Gerlingen named in his honour, the Johannes Zimmermann Stra√üe. The Johannes Zimmermann Memorial Presbyterian Churches were erected in his memory at both Abokobi and Odumase, Krobo. There is a well in Odumase (Ghana) that Johannes Zimmermann had built and is still in use. A commemorative plaque at the church in Gerlingen, St. Peter‚Äôs Evangelical Church (Evangelische Petrusgemeinde Gerlingen) was erected in 1976 for Johannes Zimmermann. The reference library of the Akrofi-Christaller Institute in Akropong, Ghana was named the \\"Johannes Zimmermann Library\\" in his honour.

Formed in late October 1942, the division was sent to the front in the Battle of Stalingrad. It then fought in the advance across southern Ukraine during 1943 and in spring 1944 participated in the Crimean Offensive, the capture of Crimea, and received the Sivash honorific for its actions. In the summer of that year the 2nd was relocated to the Baltic and fought there until the end of the war in May 1945, participating in the Battle of Memel and the Battle of K√∂nigsberg. It received the Order of Kutuzov at the end of the war and was reorganized into a brigade postwar in 1946.  World War II  37 mm AA gun of the type used by the division during World War II The 2nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Division of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK) began forming on 31 October 1942 in the Moscow Military District under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Nikolay Nikitin. On 23 November, after completing its formation, the division arrived on the Stalingrad Front south of Stalingrad, and joined the 51st Army. It provided air defense for the 51st and 57th Armies during the creation of the outer encirclement line of the pocket formed by German troops trapped in the city, the counterattack towards Kotelnikovo, and the attack towards Salsk. From 12 December, when Operation Winter Storm, a German relief attempt on the Stalingrad pocket, was launched in the Kotelnikovo area, the division helped repulse increased German air raids. The 2nd also downed or forced German transport planes off course, preventing aerial resupply of the trapped German troops. During the battle, the division was credited with downing 57 enemy aircraft, knocking out seven tanks, and killing up to a company of enemy soldiers. By 1 January 1943, it included the 1069th, 1113th, and 1117th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiments as part of 51st Army. Its 1086th Regiment was detached to the Southwestern Front's 5th Shock Army at the time, and would remain there for several months. From January, the division provided air defense for the 51st Army during the Southern Front's Salsk-Rostov Offensive. Its regiments advanced alongside the army when it reached the Don at Kalach. Colonel Alexander Mukharsky replaced Nikitin around March, during which the division provided air defense for Southern Front units against massive enemy airstrikes. In April, the 1086th rejoined the main body of the division, which was transferred to the 44th Army. The 1069th Regiment was directly subordinated to front headquarters in June. The entire division was transferred to the 28th Army in July. In August, the 1069th Regiment was detached to the 2nd Guards Army. The division transferred to the 2nd Guards Army in September, with the 1086th Regiment remaining with 28th Army. In October, the division was split, with the 1086th and 1113th Regiments detached to the 28th Army and division headquarters with the 1069th and 1117th Regiments remaining with the 2nd Guards Army. On 5 October, Lieutenant Colonel (promoted to Colonel on 10 October) Alexander Kovalyov replaced Mukharsky, who was transferred to another unit. The division was directly subordinated to the 4th Ukrainian Front (the former Southern Front) headquarters in November. In December, the division was operationally subordinated to the 4th Ukrainian Front's 3rd Guards Army. The 2nd provided air defense on the line of the Dnieper from Velikaya Lepetikha and Malaya Lepetikha to Sergeyevka. In January 1944, the 1117th Regiment was detached to the 51st Army. The main body of the division (excluding the 1117th) was directly subordinated to the front headquarters in February. In March, the division headquarters with the 1086th and 1113th Regiments transferred to the 51st Army, while the 1069th Regiment remained directly subordinated to the front. From March, the division covered the crossing of Soviet troops into Crimea over the Sivash, then provided air defense for the army and front in the Crimean Offensive. In April, the 1069th Regiment rejoined the rest of the division with the 51st Army. On 24 April the 2nd received the honorific Sivash. In May, after the end of the fighting in Crimea, the division was transferred to the RVGK. It became part of the Separate Coastal Army in June, remaining behind in Crimea. From 4 August, the division was part of the 1st Baltic Front, operationally subordinated to the 2nd Guards Army, after relocated north into the Baltic region. In the fall, the division fought in the Battle of Memel and the pursuit of German troops into the Courland Pocket. In December, the 2nd transferred to the 4th Shock Army. In February 1945, the division transferred to the 11th Guards Army in the Samland Group of Forces, besieging German troops trapped in the Samland Peninsula. During April it transferred to the 3rd Belorussian Front, fighting in the Battle of K√∂nigsberg. In May the 2nd was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class, for its actions.  Postwar  After the end of the war, the division was transferred to Libava in the Baltic Military District.

Built in 1922 as Cynthiana, over the next two decades she passed through a number of owners and had several different names; Hoosac (1922), London Corporation (1922-1937), Marionga J. Goulandris (1937-1938) and finally Benlomond from 1938 to 1942. Construction and early career Benlomond was built by Irvine's Shipbuilding & Dry Docks Co. Ltd., West Hartlepool and completed in January 1922 as Cynthiana for Furness, Withy & Co. Ltd. She was soon renamed, taking the name Hoosac in February 1922, and then London Corporation in November 1922. In 1925 Furness, Withy & Company transferred her to one of their subsidiary lines, Warren Line (Liverpool) Ltd., before she was transferred back to the parent company in 1929. In December 1937 they sold her to the Greek shipping firm Goulandris Brothers, of Andros, who renamed her Marionga J. Goulandris but in May 1938 she was sold back into British ownership, being bought by Ben Line Steamers Ltd., Leith and renamed Benlomond. She was the fourth ship of Ben Line Steamers to be named Benlomond. Benlomond was one of four pre-owned ships bought by the company as part of its expansion about this time; along with , and . Benrinnes, bought by Ben Line in November 1938, was the sistership of Benlomond, having been built by Irvine's Shipbuilding and Dry Docks Company in 1921 as the Parisiana for Furness, Withy & Company. Loss Benlomonds final voyage took her from Port Said to New York, via Cape Town and Paramaribo, under the command of her master, John Maul. On 23 November 1942 she was sailing unescorted and in ballast to Paramaribo when she was spotted by the German submarine U-172, under the command of Carl Emmermann. At 14.10 hours U-172 fired two torpedoes which hit Benlomond, sinking her within two minutes about 750 miles east of the River Amazon. After questioning the survivors, U-172 left the area. Ultimately only a single survivor of the sinking, Chinese second mess steward Poon Lim, survived to be rescued after spending 133 days on a Carley float. He was picked up by a Brazilian fishing vessel east of Salinas, and was landed at Bel√©m on 8 April 1943. The rest of the Benlomonds crew, her master, 44 crew members and eight gunners, were lost.

They specialise in crude oil, LNG and LPG tankers. The company operate a number of Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSOs) under their subsidiary Teekay Petrojarl in the North Sea. History Teekay was founded in 1973 by Torben Karlshoej, then a 31 year old Danish ship broker who had emigrated to the United States at the age of 20 and mostly worked on farms. The company was named \\"TK\\" for Karlshoej's initials. It commenced operations by purchasing small second and third hand oil tankers, a lucrative trade due to the high oil prices during the 1973‚Äì1974 oil crisis. It maintained a head office in the Bahamas, thus taking advantage of low corporate taxes. Most of its ships were registered in Liberia, thus taking advantage of the comparatively low taxes and the ability to recruit seafarers from across the world. The company grew in the 1980s by operating in the risky waters off Persian Gulf during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Under Karlshoej's leadership, the company grew further from a tanker operator to an operational ship owner in the conventional shipping market. It has since expanded across new segments including gas and offshore. It operates under four companies that are publicly traded on the New York and Oslo stock exchanges. Offshore operations In 1998, Teekay commenced operations under what is now called Petrojarl. It commenced offshore oil exploration as Golar Nor Offshore, a part of Petroleum Geo-Services (PGS) and Golar-Nor. In 2005 the company purchased the shuttle tanker Rita Knutsen. This was followed in 2007, with the Russian tanker Che Guevara which was subsequently converted into the FPSO Petrojarl Cidade de Rio das Ostras. In 2006, Petrojarl ASA was demerged from Petroleum Geo-Services and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Teekay acquired majority ownership in the company in December 2006 and Petrojarl ASA became Teekay Petrojarl ASA subsequently. Current operations Teekay currently operates a fleet that is evaluated (as of November 2017) at $12 billion, including gas and oil tankers and offshore structures, under head offices in Canada, London, Bahamas, Bermuda and Singapore. As of 2017, it owned and operated a total 65 LNG, LPG and oil tankers and 2 chartered vessels, a further 18 new buildings under order. As of November 2017, the company's leadership consisted of Kenneth Hvid (the President and Group CEO), Ingvild S√¶ther (President and CEO of Teekay Offshore Group Ltd.), Kevin Mackay (President and CEO - Teekay Tankers Ltd.), Mark Kremin (President and CEO - Teekay Gas Group Ltd.), Art Bensler (Executive Vice President, Corporate Secretary and General Counsel, Vince Lok (Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer) and William Hung (Executive Vice President, Strategic Development).

Overview  CAST attempts to reduce homelessness and crime by replacing illegal opiates with pharmaceutical heroin, hydromorphone or other substitutes.  History  Vancouver has a long history of innovation in drug treatment. The first methadone maintenance treatment program was developed in Vancouver in 1959. For 15 years, Vancouver had the only supervised injection site in North America: Insite. CAST was developed by Mayor Sam Sullivan as a result of his experience with the overdose crisis of the 1990s. He formed an organization called Inner Change to advocate for and fund-raise for a research trial called SALOME. The policy was opposed by opposition Council members and narrowly passed with 6 to 5 votes even though it was unpopular with some in his core base and faced much opposition from the community. The idea of giving heroin to heroin addicts is controversial. Nonetheless many otherwise \\"conservative\\" sectors have endorsed the plan.  Subsequent efforts  After Sullivan did not receive his party's endorsement to run for re-election, he focused on raising funds to implement the SALOME research trials. This proved that alternatives could be used for heroin. Despite the success of the research no program was instituted by the time the fentanyl crisis of late 2015 hit the province.

Present beginning around the time of the Seljuk breaking of the Sultanate of Rum in the thirteenth century, these organizations would provide an organizational force in what were largely loosely hinterlands.Lewis, Bernard. ‚ÄúThe Islamic Guilds‚Äù The Economic History Review Vol. 8, No. 1 (Dec. 1937) p. 20-37 Etymology The term akhi, derived from the Arabic word for brother, carries a particular religious connotation derived from the Quran, which instructs ‚Äúthe believers are but brothers.‚ÄùQur'an 49:10 Specifically, the brother was the leader of the organization, as chosen by his fellow members, who were known as fityan (youths). Ibn Battuta, in his travels through Anatolia, identifies the Akhiya and Futuwwa (Order of Youth, Chivalry) as interchangeable terms, both of which described the same work being done.Battuta, Ibn. Selections From the Travels of Ibn Battuta. New York: Broadway Travelers. p. 129-142 Organization Akhi groups in what would become Ottoman lands were centered around a lodge or hospice, where the members of the group would reside and partake in communal living and rituals. These rituals would have a distinctly religious element, with the Sufi traditions that distinguished Anatolia from much of the orthodox Sunni world at the time in full presence as the power of the Sultanate of Rum receded.Curry, John J. The Transformation of Muslim Mystical Thought in the Ottoman Empire. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. p. 11-30 The hospice would also serve as a guesthouse for travelers, with hospitality being perhaps the most important virtue to the members. It would be nearly impossible to overstate the extent of the influence these lodges had on the region during the Beylikate Period in Anatolia. Ibn Battuta observed during his travels in the region that ‚Äúin every district, town, and village, there are to be found members of the organization\\". G.G. Arnakis identifies the organizations as being at least partially responsible for the relative peace that broke out after the Seljuk conquest.Arnakis, G.G. ‚ÄúFutuwwa Traditions in the Ottoman Empire Akhis, Bektashi Dervishes, and Craftsmen‚Äù Journal of Near Eastern Studies Vol. 12, No. 8 (Oct. 1953) p. 232-247. In areas where imperial power, be it of the Ottomans, other beyliks, or the Seljuks, barely radiated beyond the court, these groups provided stability and organization to towns that would otherwise be unimaginable. As apt to kill off corrupt and tyrannical police as they were to debate captured Christian archbishops, the Akhiya served to protect their communities and faith at a time where the boundaries between principalities were loose at best.Arnakis, G.G. ‚ÄúGregory Palmas Among the Turks and Documents of His Captivity as Historical Sources‚Äù Speculum Vol. 26, No. 1 (Jan. 1951) p. 104-118 As the Ottomans under Orhan began to consolidate power, they began to absorb many of the functions of the brotherhoods, leaving them intact while the empire remained nascent. The brotherhoods would form the core of Ottoman communities, afforded an elite status and respect by the imperial court in exchange for their irreplaceable position in the social fabric. While later Sultans would seek to crush the political power of the Akhiya, their communal influence would remain for essentially the entire length of the Ottoman Period, taking on a role identified by some observers as resembling European Freemasonry, with a focus turning to social bonds and cooperation between workers.

Plot In the castle of a wealthy family, a seance is held to contact the spirit of a woman who had been murdered. Instead, the spirit of Lucrezia, an ancestor of the family, is recalled during the seance. Lucrezia tries to take possession of the soul of Sister Sofia, who has lived in the castle to take care of the paralytic Adolfo, owner of the castle together with his brother Andrea, the husband of the murdered woman. Not succeeding, she takes possession instead of the body of the adolescent Bimba, daughter of Andrea and the murdered woman, who until then had spent a very withdrawn and reserved life. In the following days the behavior of Bimba radically changes, due to the evil influence of Lucrezia's soul, and several times, she falls prey of the perverse sexual urges of Lucrezia, while unconsciously sheds light on the sexual and perverse vices of her family members. The family members, worried, entrust the girl to the care of Sister Sofia. The relationship between Bimba and Sister Sofia grows more confidential and between them a loving friendship is born. But in reality Bimba, subjugated by the soul of Lucrezia, sexually tempts the nun into a downward spiral of unspeakable debauchery.

Italian film historian Roberto Curti noted the films emphasis on eroticism, stating that by 1979, gothic films were hybridized with erotic themes that generally took over the narrative.

Mariangela Giordano recalled that the film was shot in March 1979 for twelve days, working \\"day and night through the weekends\\" She stated she had gotten ill on set but as the producer, and her current romantic partner Gabriele Crisanti had not taken insurance policies on the production, she did not go to the hospital until the film was finished. On reflecting on her work with the producer in Malabimba, Giallo a Venezia and Patrick Still Lives, she commented that she \\"shouldn't have done them. But I was in love with Gabriele, I would have done anything for him.\\" Release The initial version submitted to the Italian Board of Censors had a running time of 84 minutes and 45 seconds, while a longer version of the film was actually distributed with explicit sex inserts. Franco Villa denied having shot hardcore footage for the film, stating the footage shown theatrically was not his footage. Curti noted that there are no stand-in for the scenes where Laennec perform fellatio to the Uncle Adolfo character. Malabimba ‚Äì The Malicious Whore was distributed theatrically in Italy on 22 September 1979 by Stefano Film. Roberto Curti stated that the producer of Malabimba would \\"basically remake\\" the film as another horror and hardcore pornography hybrid titled La bimba di Satana which was released 1983. Reception In a retrospective review, Jason Buchanan (AllMovie) described the film as \\"a Euro- sleaze classic of the highest caliber\\" Danny Shipka, author of book on European exploitation films described the film as both fun and shocking, noting that the film mixes both softcore and hardcore inserts.

A gender and reproductive health advocate, he was known for his campaigns and education drawing attention to the food and nutrition problems of Africa, particularly of women and children. He served as the Chief Physician for Nutrition and the Director of Medical Services at the Ghana Health Service and Professor of Community Health at the University of Ghana, Legon. He was also a nutrition advisor to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, Africa Region as well as the coordinator for the World Hunger Programme of the United Nations University and a Senior Population Advisor to the World Bank. He was the President and Honorary Secretary of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences. In professional circles, he was known as the ‚ÄúGodfather or Father of Family Planning‚Äù and sometimes as the ‚ÄúGrandfather of Maternal Health‚Äù.  Early life and education  Sai was born on 23 June 1924 and started life as a barefoot little boy in the suburb of Osu, Accra in the Gold Coast colony, now modern Ghana. He belonged to the Ga ethnic group of Accra. Sai's father died when he was about three or four years old and he was raised by his mother, Emelia Shormeh Omaboe; an experience that shaped his resolve to focus on \\"women's issues\\" in his medical career. He studied at the Presbyterian boys‚Äô boarding middle school, the Salem School, Osu and won a Cadbury scholarship to Achimota School where he completed his secondary education and the pre-clinical course. He then studied medicine (MBChB) at the University of London on a government scholarship, graduating in 1955 with distinguished honours in obstetrics and gynaecology. He received a Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (DTM&H;) from the same institution in 1956 and held a master's degree in public health, earned in 1960, as a WHO Scholar at Harvard University. In addition, he received postgraduate training in internal medicine at Edinburgh. He returned to his homeland after his medical training in the United Kingdom, in time to be part of the push for independence from Great Britain ‚Äì a struggle led by Ghana's first leader, Kwame Nkrumah.  Career  In his fifty-year career, Sai advocated for family planning policies in Ghana leading to the provision of subsidized family planning services in public hospitals by the state. Based on Sai's advocacy, in 2007, the Government of John Agyekum Kufuor introduced free maternal health services as an avenue to reduce maternal mortality among adolescent girls and young women. Known in the global community as a champion of women's sexual and reproductive health, he was also an authority on health, nutrition and population. Sai believed that women should have access to medical services in a safe environment. In his early career as a young doctor, one of his biggest confrontations was with the first President of newly independent Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah. Nkrumah was an advocate of women's rights, and also pioneered population studies in Ghana, and the first full modern population census on the African continent: Ghana's 1960 census. However, Nkrumah was determined to see Ghana's human capital grow and develop as a young country and had reservations about family planning. As a result, he banned the import of contraceptives and other family planning methods. Doctors providing them had to do so secretly. Sai provided contraceptives to women ‚Äì despite the risks posed by the President's opposition. With the overthrow of Nkrumah in 1966 in a military coup, the ban on contraceptive use was lifted, and Sai began to take a leading role in Ghana's family planning policies and was soon drawn into the international sphere. The Ghana Health Service (GHS) estimated that in the 2000s that contraception use in the country was at 23 percent even though more than 52 percent of Ghana's population was morally and culturally opposed to contraception use. During this period, the Ghana Health Service noted that Ghana's maternal mortality rate is 350 deaths per 100,000 births falling short by the Sustainable Development Goals target of a reduction of 75 percent to less than a 100 deaths. A way to reduce maternal deaths was to reduce the number of pregnancies per woman by using family planning. Sai's counsel to members of the reproductive health and family planning fraternity in Ghana was to seek out the ‚Äú30 percent unmet need for family planning and push access further.‚Äù In 1967, he co-founded the Planned Parenthood Association of Ghana, previously known as the Ghana Family Planning Association. From 1989 to 1995, he was President of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). He has served in many other capacities within that organization including Assistant Secretary-General. He was instrumental in setting up the Africa Regional Office of IPPF as well as the Centre for African Family Studies (CAFS) in Nairobi. His appointment as Senior Advisor on Population to the President of the World Bank from 1985 to 1990 gave him the opportunity to influence and assist several developing countries to integrate population issues into their social and economic development strategies. He held that post after serving as Senior Population Advisor at the World Bank and working with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Sai held the Chairmanship for the Main Committees of the last two major UN conferences on population and development: 1984 International Conference on Population in Mexico City and the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. The Vatican challenged the Cairo conference agenda in a letter of opposition. The ICDP produced the Programme of Action, emphasizing ‚Äúthe centrality of women to all development programs and called for world attention to the improvement in the status of women and for equity and equality between the sexes as the basis of all human relationships.‚Äù Sai chaired various other international conferences including the WHO/UNICEF Infant and Young Child Feeding Conference held in Geneva in 1979 which led to the development of the international code on Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes; Moderator for 1987 Safe Motherhood Conference in Nairobi which launched the Safe Motherhood Initiative and the Women Deliver Conference in London in 2007. As Chairman of these conferences, Sai led the crafting of a consensus and creating an environment in which nations, groups, organization and people with strong and opposing views could state their positions and yet be prepared to respect and even accommodate their differences from the preparatory activities through the negotiations and, finally, to the adoption of international agreements. He was a supporter of the Ghana Mama Ye campaign which aimed at achieving zero maternal and infant deaths, leading to improvements in the lives of disadvantaged, low-income and vulnerable mothers and their newborns. He served in several positions in the Ghana Health Service, including being Chief Physician for Nutrition and the Director of Medical Services. He was also a pioneering Professor of Preventive and Social Medicine at the University of Ghana Medical School. The author and editor of numerous publications relating to family planning, health and nutrition, Sai was also an advisor to the President and Government of Ghana on Reproductive Health and HIV/AIDS. He played a major role in the development and establishment of various institutions and programs in Ghana, serving at various times as Assistant to the Chief of the Ministry of Health, Director of Medical Services, Chairman of the Medical and Dental Council, Physician Specialist in Human Nutrition, Fellow and later president of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences among other positions. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Ghana Medical Association, the University of Ghana Medical School (UGMS), the National Food and Nutrition Board, the Planned Parenthood Association of Ghana (PPAG) and the first head of the National Population Council among other institutions. In 1969, F. T. Sai spearheaded the roll-out of the Danfa Reproductive and Community Healthcare Facility in 1969, raising funds from the USAID and the University of California, Los Angeles, which extended family planning and public health services to 60,000 rural dwellers in Ghana. He served as an external Director of the Ghanaian central bank, the Bank of Ghana and a member of the Board of Directors of several United States-based non-profits working in Sexual and Reproductive Health. He was an Emeritus Member and sat on the boards of Women Deliver and Population Action International and was an honorary guest on the Creative Storm Networks‚Äô Maternal Health Channel Television Series, a program that informed, educated and stimulated interest in maternal health issues around the globe. His publications also covered the ethical issues in the Sexual and Reproductive Health field. Among his numerous books were ‚ÄúAdam and Eve and the Serpent‚Äù, dealing with the inequalities and the difficulties faced by African women; and ‚ÄúFred Sai Speaks Out‚Äù which is a collection of essays on his views of the reproductive health field, including a letter to Pope John Paul II asking for a reconsideration of the Vatican‚Äôs anti-contraception and family planning stance. He published his memoirs, With Heart and Voice: Fred Sai Remembers in 2010. He was a Member (1959) and later Fellow (1964) of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. He was also a Fellow of the West African College of Physicians (FWACP), elected in 1976.  Personal life  Together with his wife, Florence Aleeno Sai, n√©e Dzani who he married in 1952 in London, they raised seven children (four daughters and three sons), three of whom they adopted. One of his children, Florence Oboshie Sai-Coffie, a Ghanaian politician, advertising marketing specialist and media executive, served as a cabinet minister in the John Kufuor administration. He enjoyed playing golf and listening to highlife and jazz music.  Honours and awards  Sai was a recipient of the United Nations Population Award in 1993 for his work in population, reproductive health and nutrition. He was awarded the 1995 Prince Mahidol Award in \\"recognition of his long-standing involvement and global leadership on international family planning and population issues.\\" With the Prince Mahidol Award, he set up a fund at the University of Ghana, Legon, for women reading science. About fifty students have benefited from this prize. He received Honorary Doctorates from Tufts University (DLitt) and the University of Ghana, Legon (DSc). He was also accorded the Honorary Fellowship of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for his promotion of women's health and rights. In 1998, Sai received the Harvard School of Public Health Alumni Award of Merit for his contributions to the field of public health; the highest honour the school bestows on its alumni. In 2006, he was awarded one of Ghana's highest national honours, Order of the Star of Ghana - Member of the Star of Ghana (MSG) Civil Division. The Fred T. Sai Institute, an initiative of the IPPF Africa Region, was established in Sai's honour as a \\"pioneer public health research institute, championing research on population and sexual reproductive health...to generate evidence on effective health strategies aimed at improving the health of the population in sub-Saharan Africa.\\" In June 2019, on the occasion of his 95th birthday, Sai was acknowledged for his efforts towards the welfare of the female gender over two and a half decades. The event, organised by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Ghana Country Office, was attended by several members of the international and diplomatic communities and was graced by the Ghanaian president Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo Addo and his wife, Rebecca Akufo-Addo.

He observes, grace does not destroy nature, but fulfills its potential (Summa Theologiae (ST), I, I, 8 ad 2).Consecrated Phrases: A Latin Theological Dictionary; Latin Expressions Commonly Found in Theological Writings Third Editio, James T. Bretzke (Collegeville:Liturgy Press, 2003) Latin quotes by Saint Thomas Aquinas \\"Since therefore grace does not destroy nature but perfects it, natural reason should minister to faith as the natural bent of the will ministers to charity.\\" Thomas maintains that the truth of human nature finds total fulfilment through sanctifying grace, since this is \\"perfectio naturae rationalis creatae\\" (Quaestiones quodlibetales, 4, 6). He stated that grace does not contradict nature. God's creation cannot be totally corrupted by human sin; grace heals the incomplete natural notion of God.Gerhar Suter, \\"Grace\\", The Encyclopedia of Protestantism, vol 2, Eds., Hans J. Hillerbrand (London: Routledge, 2004), 831 Aquinas divides grace into two basic kinds (ST I-II, III). One is gratia gratum faciens.

It is this grace that receives the much greater part of the attention in the treatise on grace. The other kind of grace is gratia gratis data, commonly translated as \\"gratuitous grace.\\" The phrase is not altogether happy; after all, the first kind of grace is also gratuitously, in the sense of freely, given by God. This gratuitous grace, in the technical sense, is given not for the sanctification of the recipient, but to allow the recipient to help others to God (I-II. III, 1c).

The text, which was approved by a parliamentary majority, requests compliance with the opinions of international entities on human rights, in which judges, courts and other public bodies are encouraged to execute measures, opinions and acts issued by organizations such as the UN and the OAS. The measure benefits prisoners and political persecuted expressly mentioned in the document, including Miguel Henrique Otero, Leopoldo Lopez, Antonio Ledezma, Judge Maria Lourdes Afiuni, among others. When a Constituent Assembly was promoted with the support of Nicol√°s Maduro's government to draft a new constitution for Venezuela in May, 2017, Guevara and the Democratic Unity Roundtable boycotted the election claiming that the Constituent Assembly was \\"a trick to keep [the incumbent ruling party] in power.\\" Since the opposition did not participate in the election, the incumbent Great Patriotic Pole won almost all seats in the assembly by default. At the end of October, 2017, Freddy Guevara, declared that his political Popular Will (VP) will not participate in any elections called by Maduro's government \\"as a mechanism of denunciation against the dictatorship.\\"  End of parliamentary immunity  On November 3, 2017, the Supreme Court disqualifies his parliamentary immunity after being accused of instigating violence during opposition protests. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (CIDH) expressed its concern over the suspension of Guevara's parliamentary immunity. On November 5, 2017, he fled to the official residence of the Chilean ambassador in Caracas. A statement issued by the Chilean Foreign Ministry notes that \\"The Government of Chile has granted (Guevara) the quality of guest of our Embassy.\\" It added that ‚ÄúIn the face of what he deemed immediate threats against his security and personal wellbeing, he has requested the protection of Chile.‚Äù From his refuge at the embassy Guevara stated: \\"Very soon we will see each other in the streets marching to Miraflores, not to overthrow Maduro, but to swear in a new President:\\" References 1986 births Living people People of the Crisis in Venezuela Popular Will politicians Andr√©s Bello Catholic University alumni Venezuelan city councillors Movimiento Estudiantil (Venezuela) ","title":"Freddy Guevara"},{"id":"55874217","text":"The St. Alphonse was a small steamship operated by the Brothers of the Oblate Order of Mary Immaculate, in the Northwest Territories.

The Singapore headquartered startup was founded in 2015 by Ankiti Bose and Dhruv Kapoor, and has operations spanning Indonesia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Philippines, Australia, India and the United States. Today, the company employs over 500 staff representing more than 20 different nationalities, and works with close to 50,000 partners across the fashion supply chain. These partners comprise manufacturers, retail merchants, distributors, indie and global brands.  History  = Establishment and business expansion = Zilingo, a play on the word \\"zillion,\\" was established in 2015 by Ankiti Bose and Dhruv Kapoor. The idea came from when Bose was on holiday in Bangkok and noticed that many of the small and medium-sized shops had no online presence. The company began with seed funding from Sequoia India and raised an additional $8 million in a Series A funding round in September 2016. It raised an additional $18 million in 2017 in a Series B round and $54 million in a Series C round in 2018. The company started off as a long-tail fashion marketplace leveraging Southeast Asia's growing internet connectivity to bring small merchants from the street markets of Bangkok and Jakarta into the e-commerce fold, supported by distribution, cataloguing and financing services Zilingo began to offer. After beefing its distribution capabilities, Zilingo expanded focus towards B2B opportunities across the supply chain with an eye on service opportunities the platform could offer to transform a fragmented, inefficient, cash and tech-strapped value chain. The focus towards B2B opportunities started with a suite of basic products to help merchants and manufacturers manage their e-commerce business. This initially included inventory management and sales tracking, and today the company has graduated to deeper services like financing, sourcing and procurement, and a ‚Äòstyle hunter‚Äô for identifying upcoming fashion trends. So they expanded, developing software and other tools to allow vendors to access factories from Bangladesh to Vietnam and also help with cross-border shipping and inventory management. Since 2018, Zilingo has also worked with financial technology firms to provide working capital to small sellers so they can buy raw materials to produce goods. The company takes a cut whenever a deal is brokered or a sale is made via its platform, with a business model effectively removing removes a lot of the agents that brands and factories inefficiently deal with. This also ensures that profits can be evenly spread across all stakeholders in the fashion industry, thereby edging the company towards its vision of making the fashion supply chain a levelled playing field. = Global expansion = In September 2017, Zilingo was shipping to eight countries and has seller hubs in Hong Kong, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand, adding 5,000 new merchants in the previous twelve months. By September 2019 the company generates 80% of its revenue from its business-to-business operation of matching brands with suppliers in Southeast Asia and South Asia, with aggressive moves to expand in the United States. In 2019, the company raised $226 million in a Series D round from existing investors Sequoia India, Burda Capital, Sofina with Singapore's sovereign fund Temasek Holdings joining the tech-platform's capital table. The latest round takes the tech-platform to US$308 million from investors, making it one of Southeast Asia's highest capitalised startups- edging its valuation towards unicorn status. The company announced that it planned to invest US$100 million to build out its fashion supply chains in the US, as part of its accelerated growth plans in new markets such as Australia, Europe and the Middle East. = Corporate restructuring = Amidst the global economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Zilingo announced that it was laying off 5% of its global workforce. A total of 44 employees based in Singapore were dismissed via a Zoom teleconfering call, with employees expressing disappointment at the company's decision despite the Singaporean government's 75 per cent subsidy of local employees wages and the management's lack of post-retrenchment support. The company has also been reported to close its US and Australia offices in 2020, to focus on its core business plans in Asia.. Subsequently, retrenchment was carried out in Thailand, India, and Indonesia offices, with an estimated 120 employees being laid off. CFO James Perry, a veteran dealmaker, was reported to have resigned following the rounds of downsizing.https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/garage/zilingo-cfo-james-perry- resigns-to-return-to-citigroup-for-tech-deals  Technology and commerce  Zilingo started off as a mobile-first eCommerce marketplace and today has expanded into a B2B tech-platform, with services spanning different offerings for players across the fashion supply chain. The startup was notable for the seller management platform created in 2016, when Zilingo was simply a fashion eCommerce marketplace. This tool helped small retailers and long tail brands formally organise their business, through online distribution, inventory management tools and APIs for logistics. By 2018, the startup had evolved its seller management tool to become an additional income generator for the business, with merchants being able to cross-list across Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia versions of the site, and distribute globally. The platform had also begun offering financial services from third parties, a ‚Äústyle hunter‚Äù that aggregates upcoming trends from fashion watchers and icons, product sourcing and content and photography services‚Äîand Zilingo's captive seller base expanded to include professional fashion sellers, SMEs, brands in Southeast Asia and B2B businesses globally through Zilingo's \\"Zilingo Asia Mall\\" platform.

She was convicted of killing her infant son Richard, and was publicly hanged at Devizes, Wiltshire. After her trial she confessed to having poisoned seven of her other children. Early life Smith was born in the village of Bratton, Wiltshire, the daughter of William and Sarah Prior (or Pryor). Her father, who died in 1830, was a successful yeoman farmer, while her mother was a prominent member of the local Particular Baptist sect. In May 1831, she married an agricultural labourer, Philip Smith, who had a reputation as a drunkard. Their first child, Jane, was born the following year. Ten others followed, none of which lived more than a few months. In 1846, following her mother's death, Smith inherited ¬£100 and moved the family to Westbury.Watson (2008), p. 120. Her husband squandered the inheritance, and she was forced to find seasonal work as a crop-picker and vegetable grower, and living in \\"a visible state of poverty and ill health\\".Watson (2008), p. 121. Discovery Smith's eleventh child, Richard, was born on 16 May 1849. He was initially healthy, but was taken ill on 7 June and died on the morning of 12 June. The local registrar, George Shorland, initially recorded the cause of death as unknown, but was persuaded by local rumours to order an inquest. Richard's body was exhumed on 22 June and autopsied on 24 June, where traces of arsenic were discovered in his stomach. Smith's neighbours claimed that she had made a series of attempts to purchase poison both before and after the birth, culminating in a purchase of \\"white arsenic\\" on the morning of 7 June. Inquests into the deaths of two more of her children (Sarah and Edward) were conducted on 18 July, and both their bodies were also found to contain arsenic.Watson (2008), p. 122. Trial and execution Smith was put on trial for Richard's death on 9 August 1849, at the court of assize in Devizes. Eighteen witnesses were called, many of whom testified about her attempts to buy poison and false statements she had made about her son's health. The jury took 30 minutes to find her guilty, but also issued a recommendation of mercy; the judge ignored this and sentenced her to death.Watson (2008), p. 123. A week after the trial, Smith made a confession to the prison chaplain in which she admitted using rat poison to kill seven of her other children.Watson (2008), p. 124. Of her eleven children, only the first-born survived to adulthood ‚Äì two died of natural causes, and the other eight were killed. Smith was publicly hanged in Devizes on 23 August, despite two petitions for mercy being sent to the Home Secretary. The press and general public were heavily in favour of her execution, despite infanticide usually being viewed as less repellent than standard murder and thus less deserving of capital punishment. Factors that were atypical (and thus weighed against her) included the premeditated nature of the act and its apparent brutality ‚Äì poisoning was considered much more cruel than the more common methods of drowning or smothering. As an older married woman, she was also viewed with less sympathy than younger women who gave birth out of wedlock and killed their babies to avoid social stigma.Watson (2008), p. 125.

She was the fifth and final daughter of Luis Espejo and Catalina Aldaz, a teacher of medicines and natural sciences. Espejo married , a lawyer 22 years her junior, in the Church of El Sagrario. Their marriage was sponsored by Juan de Dios Morales and his wife, Mar√≠a Oleas. Despite the shared interests in independence from Spain and science, de Espejo left to work as the deputy of the Cortes of C√°diz and struck up a relationship with Gertrudis Sanalova y Benito, an Andalusian. Sanalova became de Espejo's heir universal when she died. Espejo would live next to the family of Juan de Dios Morales. Espejo would accompany her brother Eugenio as a nurse during medical visits, and both would be present in the relief effort mounted after yellow fever struck Quito in 1785. She would care for another of her siblings, Juan Pablo de Espejo, when he became ill in 1764, putting her in the running for Ecuador's first nurse. Her medical knowledge was aided by the inheritance of Lorenzo Heinster's 26-volume encyclopedia of medicine.

In this accident involving car number 4 from the WSW GTW 72 series, five persons lost their lives while 47 were injured, some of them seriously. This was the worst accident in the railway's history and, to date, the only one since the railway opened in 1901 to have had a deadly outcome.  Circumstances  The articulated train involved in the accident was travelling near kilometre 7 on the suspension railway's route at about 5:45 am local time at a speed of roughly 50 km/h when it struck a steel component (a \\"claw fastener\\") that had temporarily been attached to the running rail on the overhead track. The impact tore the lead bogie, the first of four, off the train's roof. The vehicle next leaned over to the right, derailed, and then fell almost ten metres into the River Wupper. The train's front section came down on a bridge carrying steam heating pipes across the Wupper, breaking it in the middle. The bogie that had been torn off on impact at first remained up on the track, but quickly came off and fell down on the train, breaking through the vehicle's body.  Rescue efforts  The accident site in 2005; the steam pipe bridge can be seen in the background. A view of the accident scene from the riverbank in 2016 looking towards Pestalozzistra√üe station, in the direction from which the train came. Employees from the firm ELBA, which stood alongside the river and the track, climbed over a scaffold in the river after hearing the loud bang and began the efforts to save the victims. The train's driver, who was himself injured, also helped to rescue the passengers. According to a resident who called the emergency services to report the accident, his report was at first met with laughter from the dispatcher on the telephone, as it was considered inconceivable for a Schwebebahn train to fall off the overhead track, and nobody had ever died in an accident on this railway, which was thus said to be the world's safest. In the end, more than 150 firefighting and ambulance personnel were on hand, along with twelve emergency physicians, to rescue and treat the injured at the site, which could only be reached with difficulty. Even clergymen were called into service to minister to those who were suffering from psychological shock. The injured were taken to two nearby buildings and a tent set up by the firefighters in an underpass. Further gathering points for the injured were set up at a factory and in a quickly built tent city at a carpark. Conference rooms on the ground floor at a bank became a field hospital. A nearby hospital, the Ferdinand-Sauerbruch-Klinikum (now called the Helios Universit√§tsklinikum Wuppertal), was the first to admit patients from the accident scene. Meanwhile, the city square Robert-Daum- Platz, where Bundesstra√üe 7 and Landesstra√üe 427 cross, became an emergency landing pad for three rescue helicopters. At the St√§dtisches Klinikum Barmen (another hospital, now also part of the Helios Universit√§tsklinikum Wuppertal), all routine operations were postponed and all available doctors were pressed into emergency service. Within three hours of the accident, all 47 of the injured, suffering from broken bones, bruises and lacerations, found themselves at hospitals in Wuppertal, Remscheid and Solingen. Two men were recovered from the wreck dead, while a woman's body was only recovered hours later after the river had borne it downstream from the accident site. Two other passengers later succumbed to their injuries.  Recovery efforts  First, the affected stretch of the overhead track and the trainwreck in the river were seized by order of the public prosecutor's office (Staatsanwaltschaft). The recovery of the fallen suspension railway train was readied on 13 April 1999 and proceeded only with great difficulty. It turned out that an emergency laneway next to an office-residential building could not be used for the needed 300-metric-ton crane because an underground garage presented stability problems. Across the Wupper lay the grounds of the firm ELBA, which offered an alternative, although the direct path to the accident scene was blocked by a production building. Nevertheless, during that day, the crane was positioned there and an excavator was lowered into the Wupper. To prepare for the actual recovery, the steel truss carrying the steam pipes, onto which the suspension railway train had fallen, had to be taken apart. Meanwhile, several halogen floodlights were mounted on the overhead track and a police light mast vehicle was brought to the scene. As evening set in, the recovery scene was brightly lit. The work went on through the night into 14 April 1999. From the 22-metric-ton articulated train, the first bits to be lifted out of the river were three bogies each weighing roughly 3¬Ω metric tons. These were lifted with the crane during the day over the ELBA work buildings and onto an articulated truck waiting on Ernststra√üe (street), which had been closed for the occasion. The fourth bogie, the one that had been torn off the train's roof in the accident and had fallen into the passenger compartment, had to be recovered later. The tail end of the articulated train could now be freed and lifted out of the riverbed. In work that took until evening, the whole train was lifted out of the Wupper after having been taken apart into three pieces. These were then transported to one of the halls at the Generaloberst-Hoepner-Kaserne (barracks) on Lichtscheid, Wuppertal's highest hill. The section of rail from the overhead track onto which the fateful claw fastener was attached was removed to a place for safekeeping on Friday 16 April 1999.  Investigations  Beginning in November 1997, in the course of renovation work in the leadup to the Schwebebahn's centenary in 2001, each weekend was spent completely replacing the railway's weightbearing structure. The steel claw fastener that was attached to the guide rail served to stabilize the overhead track during this work. On the night before the accident, work had ended during which parts of the overhead track, a few piers from the accident site, had been replaced. The night's work lagged so far behind schedule that the work site was left only ten minutes before the morning's first train from the Vohwinkel direction came along. The workers were apparently in such a hurry that they forgot to remove the claw fastener. The Technischer √úberwachungsverein (T√úV) Rheinland/Berlin-Brandenburg was authorized to investigate and examine the whole process of the renovations on the stretch of the line from Pestalozzistra√üe station to Ohligsm√ºhle station (each one stop from Robert-Daum-Platz station, the nearest to where the accident happened) from 9 to 12 April 1999 from the time when they began until the line was ready for use, and the documentation relating thereto, as well as the established organization for verifying safe suspension railway operation after completion of periodic building in which replacement work is done on sections of the overhead track. In the subsequent proceedings, it became clear that the train's fall from the track did not arise from a technical defect or a systemic error, but rather owed itself only to careless disassembly work towards the end of that night's shift, and deficient oversight of this work. A test run that could have prevented the accident was neither planned nor prescribed by law.  Judicial consequences  At the Wuppertal State Court (Landgericht), the prosecutor, Rolf Mayer, put it to the defendants, three Wuppertal City Works Corporation (WSW Wuppertaler Stadtwerke, or WSW for short) employees along with four fitters and their foreman from Lavis GmbH, the Aschaffenburg company contracted to do the renovation work on Suspension Railway, that carelessness had led to the accident. He further said that the four fitters had let every care slip when they had not removed the claw fastener from the overhead track, and that the other defendants had failed to make sure that the line was in good condition for use, despite having had the responsibility to do just that. The fitters' foreman told the court that he could not rule out the possibility of \\"unwittingly having made a mistake\\". He could not, he said, oversee all the work being done. The fitters had clearly been assigned the job of removing the claw. \\"I can limit myself during supervisory duties to spot checks only,\\" he further said. He had to rely on the fitters, among whom were \\"experienced men\\", for this was, according to him, necessary. The two accused WSW inspectors who in the end had given the green light for the suspension railway to begin running on the morning in question, for their part, told the court that they had not been able to see the claw on the track because it had been too dark at the time and they had had no portable light. The works manager who had developed the safety scheme for the renovation work told the court, \\"I complied to the full extent with my duties,\\" to which Mayer responded with a suggestion that the manager's safety scheme had been inadequate. The four fitters had nothing to say in response. Many of the surviving victims were on hand for the proceedings, including at least one who had been left with permanent mobility issues arising from injuries in the accident. The accused who was responsible for the safety scheme, the works manager, and the workers who were responsible for dismantling certain equipment in the area of the accident, including the claw fitting, were each acquitted by the State Court, partly for legal reasons, partly on factual grounds. The accused who were responsible for technical or building work oversight, but who nevertheless did not carry out their supervisory functions in accordance with standards, were each found guilty by the State Court of negligent homicide in five legally concurrent cases in coincidence with negligent bodily harm in 37 legally concurrent cases, and sentenced to probation. In the ruling handed down by the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) on 31 January 2002 (4 StR 289/01), the Federal Court upheld the State Court's guilty verdicts against those who were responsible for technical or building work oversight, and the foreman's acquittal. However, after an appeal from the prosecutor's office and a third party, the Federal Court overturned the fitters' acquittals, saying that the State Court had made a legal error by dividing what was an instance of collective responsibility into separate ones by applying the \\"principle of reliance\\" (Vertrauensgrundsatz). The case as it related to the acquitted defendants was sent back to another chamber at the Wuppertal State Court. In these proceedings, one of the workers was sentenced to four months' probation, while the administrative fine of ‚Ç¨500 to which the other three had been sentenced was suspended. The WSW, as the suspension railway's operator, paid some DM 1.3 million in damages, for pain and suffering, for medical treatment and for burial costs, as well as for specialists to help the bereaved and others affected by the accident overcome their psychological trauma. The total cost to the Corporation from the Wuppertal Suspension Railway accident ran to well over DM 8 million. In a press release dated 30 September 2000, the WSW acknowledged that the Wuppertal Suspension Railway accident had badly affected some people's health and psychological wellbeing, not only victims in the accident itself, but also their kin. The WSW also declared in the release that in future it would lend those affected any conceivable help in the form of counselling, support and financial compensation, even after the legal proceedings were over. This included two telephone numbers at which callers could speak to advisers. An ombudsman was appointed to help those affected in their dealings with all questions relating to the accident's consequences. The release also dealt with questions about safety raised at the legal proceedings. While admitting that the improvements to the safety plan that had been introduced in June 1999, only two months after the accident, could not yet properly be evaluated ‚Äì the responsibility for that lay with the Technical Oversight Authority (Technische Aufsichtsbeh√∂rde) in the local Regierungsbezirk ‚Äì the WSW also pointed out that questions raised in court repeatedly about the train's and the track's safety had to be seen alongside the lack of any such deficiencies that could be found by an expert consultant hired by the public prosecutor's office (Staatsanwaltschaft). The release ended with the WSW stating that it would not comment on the court‚Äôs guilty verdicts against the accused.  Technical consequences  Repair work was undertaken by WSW suspension railway workshop employees once extensive structural evaluations of overhead track support installation and of the effects wrought by the accident itself on the overhead track had been done by outside engineering consultants and other experts. Many safety tests were undertaken, among them a special inspection of the whole overhead track, including supports and test runs with the five articulated trains that since the accident had been the main and secondary foci of attention among the rolling stock. Extensive shunting work was necessary at the line's two termini, Vohwinkel and Oberbarmen to bring the trains into working order. Preparatory work for the repairs to the damaged parts of the overhead track at the accident site was begun on 31 May 1999, after the crane needed for replacing overhead track parts had been set up on ELBA's property a few days earlier. The actual repair work, involving the replacement of roughly five metres of rail support, running rail and current rail, began at midday on 2 June 1999. It is now established practice to do test runs after such work, even if this is still not required by law. The Schwebebahn was opened back up to the public on 8 June 1999, some eight weeks after the accident. After being examined, the piece of rolling stock damaged in the accident, car number 4, was scrapped and not replaced.  Public memorials  Memorial plaque at Robert-Daum-Platz station Memorial plaque at the accident site On 12 April 2000, the first anniversary of the fateful day, Wuppertal's chief mayor (Oberb√ºrgermeister) Hans Kremendahl and WSW's chairman of the board Rolf Krumsiek unveiled a memorial plaque to the victims of the accident. It can be found at Robert-Daum-Platz station. Later, on 18 April 2009, days after the accident's tenth anniversary, another memorial plaque was unveiled at a spot much nearer the accident site, on the north bank of the Wupper, a few metres from the steam pipe bridge onto which the train fell (and which has since been repaired).

It is located about from the coast. It is part of the lands traditionally owned by the Mirarr, an Aboriginal people of the Gunwinyguan linguistic group. mirarr.net Although it is surrounded by the World Heritage Listed Kakadu National Park, Madjedbebe itself is located within the Jabiluka Mineral Leasehold. Archaeological findings Madjedbebe is the oldest known site showing the presence of humans in Australia. Archaeological excavations conducted by Clarkson et al. (2017) yielded evidence to suggest that Madjedbebe was first occupied by humans possibly by 65,000 +/- 6,000 years ago and at least by 50,000 years ago. \\"The stone artefacts and stratigraphic details support previous claims for human occupation 50‚Äì60 ka and show that human occupation during this time differed from later periods\\" While the age of 50,000 years ago has been widely accepted since the 1990s, this latter estimate (of ca. 65,000 years ago) has, as of 2017, been questioned by some experts. The date sets the minimum age for the arrival of humans in Australia, and by extension for the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa. More than 100,000 artefacts have been excavated (including >10,000 artefacts from the lowest dense occupation layer termed 'Phase 2'), including flaked stone artefacts,McNeil, J. 2016 Demonstrating the Stratigraphic Integrity of Madjedbebe: An Analysis of Silcrete Lithic Artefacts.

Unpublished BA(Hons) thesis, School of Social Science, University of Queensland, St Lucia. Fuel wood was also sourced from local eucalyptus and moonson vine thicket forests.  History of archaeological research The Madjedbebe site was first documented by researchers in the 1970s as part of the Alligator Rivers Environmental Fact Finding StudyKamminga, J. and H. Allen 1973 Report of the Archaeological Survey: Alligator Rivers Environmental Fact- Finding Study. Darwin: Government Printer. (of course, Mirarr people had always known about the existence of the site). In 1973 archaeologist Johan Kamminga carried out a small-scale test pit excavation to a depth of nearly 2.5 m below surface, which provided the first evidence that the site contained a Pleistocene-aged occupation history. The uppermost 60 cm of the site was rich shell midden, with abundant shells, faunal remains, stone artefacts and human remains. Below this the site was very sandy and contained mostly stone artefacts. In 1988 the site was re-visited by archaeologists Rhys Jones and Christopher Chippindale, along with geochronologist Richard 'Bert' Roberts. At this time they augered a single core at the site in order to trial the then new technique of thermoluminescence dating at the site. The following year, Jones and Roberts returned to the site with archaeologist Mike Smith and excavated another test-pit adjacent to that of Kamminga. The TL age estimates they obtained suggested the site was about 50,000 years old. These ages were queried at the time (and later) on various grounds by numerous researchers, but Roberts et al. responded to the queries re-affirming their confidence in the dates. In 2012 and 2015 a team of researchers, led by Christopher Clarkson and working in partnership with Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation, re- excavated the site to try and dispel the questions about the antiquity of the site. (95% CI). \\"settlement of Madjedbebe around 65 ka (conservatively 59.3 ka, calculated as 65.0 ka minus the age uncertainty of 5.7 kyr at 95.4%)\\" Recent results published by Clarkson and his team have led to a series of responses, again with some questioning the integrity of the site stratigraphy and validity of the ages of human occupation, however Clarkson's team has stood by the dates.  Rock art  Although it is best known as Australia's oldest archaeological site, Madjedbebe also includes an extensive assemblage of rock art motifs on the walls. In 2012 a research team from the Australian National University systematically documented the rock art at the site, under the auspices of the Mirarr Gunwarddebim Project. The team recorded more than 1000 motifs at the site. As many of the images are faded, and many overlap, this is the minimum number of motifs the site that can be seen today; no doubt in the past there were many hundreds more present that no longer survive. The Madjedbebe motifs are mostly paintings (created using wet paint), but there are also some stencils (where a negative image is created by spraying wet paint around the outside of an object held up against the wall), drawings (created by dragging a piece of dry ochre or charcoal across the wall) and beeswax figures (created by applying small, rolled up pieces of beeswax to the wall surface). A variety of different coloured pigments have been used to create the art at Madjedbebe. These are mostly ochres (red, yellow and orange), but many are also white clay (kaolinite) and some black charcoal. Rock art is highly significant for the Mirarr people. The same image can convey different meanings to different people, depending on their cultural standing. The Madjedbebe motifs include many human-like figures ('anthropomorphs'), geometric designs, hand stencils, fish (including catfish, barramundi, freshwater long-tom, mullet and saratoga), fibre objects,Miller, E. 2016 The Case for Baskets: Rock Paintings of Bags and Baskets in Western Arnhem Land, Australia. BA (Hons), The Australian National University, Canberra. and objects from the 'European-contact period'. The latter include firearms, European people (wearing clothing, hats and standing in a characteristic 'hands on hip' manner), pipes, knives and ships. There are no absolute ages for any of the rock art motifs at Madjedbebe. Instead, the art has been dating used relative techniques. This suggests that the majority of the art presented today was created in the last 1500 years, though some motifs may be several thousand years old. It is highly likely that the tradition of painting in the site is far older than this, with older paintings having faded away or been painted over. Of relevance here are the fragments of ochre recovered from the lowest occupation levels during the 2012 and 2015 excavations at Madjedbebe, some of which have ground facets. These are a tantalising suggestion that even at this early time people were engaging in some form of artistic pursuit, whether that was painting motifs on the walls of the shelter, or decorating objects or themselves with the ground ochre.

Fbxo40 induces ubiqitination of IRS1, thus limiting activity of IGF1 signaling (Shi et al, 2011). Function Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXO40, are characterized by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by SKP1 (MIM 601434), cullin (see CUL1; MIM 603134), and F-box proteins, act as protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other protein interaction domains. Fbxo40 in particular engages a unique substrate, IRS1, which is a protein in the IGF1 signaling pathway.

Constructed in the Old Colonial Grecian style based on original designs by Colonial Architect, Mortimer Lewis, the building structure was completed in 1880 under the supervision of Barnet's successor, James Barnet. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The courthouse is predominately used for sittings of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. History Darlinghurst Courthouse and residence was originally designed by the Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis. Work commenced in 1835 but was not completed until 1844. The construction of a new courthouse and gaol had been a priority of the incoming Governor of New South Wales, Richard Bourke, who was concerned by the need to march prisoners through the city from the gaol on George Street to the courthouse on King Street. The foundations for Darlinghurst Courthouse were laid by convict work gangs and construction began in 1836. Court proceedings were held in the building as early as 1842, despite the unfinished state of the building. Construction of a new gaol in Darlinghurst began in the 1820s and was ready for occupation in the early 1840s. The courthouse was a milestone building in New South Wales, being specifically designed to suit its purpose and impart authority and the power of the law. Darlinghurst Courthouse was subsequently altered and extended by successive Colonial and Government Architects. This began with Edmund Blacket, who supervised the repair to the roof in the 1850s which was in danger of collapse. Colonial Architect James Barnet designed major flanking court room pavilion additions to the building in 1884-88. Major repairs were undertaken to the original wing of the courthouse in 1901. The entire roof was replaced and changes were made to the fa√ßade. The drawings for these alterations were signed by George McRae in the Government Architect's Office. In 1903, Darlinghurst Courthouse was selected as one of the sites for the newly-created High Court of Australia following Federation. In 1907, accommodation was provided for the expansion of the High Court. Alterations included the addition of a new single-storey wing to house five new rooms. An increase in the number of High Court Justices led to the construction of a second storey on this new wing. Numerous alterations took place throughout the twentieth century to cope with increasing court proceedings and expansions of the High Court. In 1913-14 a second expansion took place to further accommodate the High Court and eventually a new high court was added to the complex in 1922. Alterations, maintenance and expansions continued to take place throughout the twentieth century. A major extension on the eastern side of the courthouse was completed 1963. The extension was designed by the Government Architect's Office and includes two courtrooms and offices. The High Court was relocated to Canberra in 1980, following completion of a purpose-built building.  Description  Darlinghurst Courthouse and Residence is a massive, heavily designed Old Colonial Grecian style public building. It communicates its civic presence through its form. The symmetrical building uses elements of the Greek temple form, having a fluted stone Doric columned portico supporting a pedimented gable entrance to the central court (Court 5), flanked by colonnaded wings which stand forward of the robust front elevations. The courthouse and residence are constructed in smooth dressed sandstone with a slate roof, timber floors and joinery and a marble tiled vestibule.Schwager Brooks 1993 The interiors of the courthouse are highly intact, with original furniture and fittings intact in all courtrooms and most offices. The courthouse has been added to continuously throughout its 170-year history, but retains a strong, coherent form to the main frontage on Oxford Street. Additions have generally maintained the qualities of the original courthouse, with high quality materials and fixtures used throughout. The courthouse is set back from the street in grounds with a curved driveway and scattered plantings. An iron palisade fence with a sandstone base bounds the courthouse grounds and heavy sandstone and iron entrance gates are located to the north and south. The rear boundary of the grounds is defined by the wall of Darlinghurst Gaol. The prison dock is located between the courthouse building and the gaol wall. The courthouse complex includes seven court rooms (supreme courts and district courts), jury rooms, judge and associate chambers, sheriff's office, courtkeeper's residence, court reporters office, cells, corrective services, witness rooms, and kitchens for jury meals.  Heritage listing  The Darlinghurst Court House and residence is the finest, and only erudite Old Colonial Grecian public building complex surviving in Australia. Commenced in the 1830s, it has a long and continual association with the provision of law and order along with the neighbouring Darlinghurst Gaol complex. The building is prominently sited at Taylor Square. The Court House, designed by colonial architect Mortimer Lewis and built between 1837 and 1844, is the first purpose designed court house to be built in NSW. The pavilions on either side were designed by James Barnet around 1886. The extension facing Victoria Street was designed by the Government Architect's Office and completed c.1963.Lumby, 2006 Darlinghurst Courthouse was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Its official scenic area opened in the year 2000 and covers , with about 400 attractions grouped into 14 tourist areas. Name Mount Mian is supposedly named for the resemblance of its long, unbroken ridgeline to a piece of cotton. In ancient Chinese, however, mi√°n did not refer to cotton but to silk floss. It was then used by extension for the ideas of \\"weak\\", \\"soft\\", and \\"downy\\", before coming to be used in modern Chinese as the usual word for cotton. Geography Mt Mian is a branch of the Taihang Mountains south of the Fen River. Its official scenic area covers , with about 400 attractions grouped into 14 tourist areas. The chain's ridgeline stretches for over , with its highest peak reaching . The vegetation in the area has been a focus of study at Shanxi University. Geographical features of note include Buddha Embrace Rock, Tiesuo Ridge, Yinkong Cavity, and the Mosta Dome. History Mt Mian is usually credited as the place of the retreat where Jie Zhitui and his mother were burnt alive in a forest fire begun by his lord, Duke Wen of the state of Jin, in the 7thcentury. Duke Wen's remorse prompted him to erect a temple in Jie's honor, with sacrifices funded by designated lands in nearby Mianshang. By the middle of the Han dynasty, people around Taiyuan Commandery were treating Jie as a tutelary deity and observing a taboo against lighting fires for five days around mid-winter.. By the mid-2nd century, it was being observed for an entire month and causing hardship on the young and elderly. to the point that Cao Cao and other leaders began attempting to ban Jie's Cold Food Festival altogether, despite its having moved by that point to Qingming in early spring. Commoners continued to ignore these provisions and to particularly revere a stand of blackened trees, one looking as though it were held in a man's arms, where various miracles were reported.. A compromise under the Northern Wei was to restrict it to the area surrounding MtMian in 496 but its popularity was such that it continued to spread until it was observed by most of China under the Sui and transformed into the Tomb Sweeping Festival under the Tang and Song. Mt Mian has been an important Taoist site since the Spring and Autumn Period (8th‚Äì5thcenturies) of the Zhou. The first Buddhist temple was erected on the mountain under the Northern Wei and, by the early Tang, it had become large and powerful. During the collapse of the Sui and rise of the Tang, Li Shimin (later \\"Emperor Taizong\\") defeated Song Jingang in the Queshu Valley below MtMian, prompting the surrender of Yuchi Gong. During the Southern Song, Li Wugong and Li Shi fought Jin soldiers nearby. Under the Mongolian Yuan, Yunfeng and other temples on the mountain were repaired. At the end of the Ming, the military governor at Taiyuan retreated to MtMian to lead his ultimately unsuccessful defense of the area. During World War II, Zhang Dehan and Li Zhimin led Communist guerrillas against Japanese and Nationalists in the area.. The Japanese retaliated, damaging or destroying most of the temples in 1940. Entrance to the MtMian Scenic Area The mountain has been used as a summer resort since imperial times. Since 1995, Yan Jiying, chairman of the Sanjia Coal and Chemical Company, has spent 600mRMB repairing the mountain and its temples. It was opened as a public scenic area in 2000. It remains among the most important Taoist sites in modern China. The second major Taoist rite to occur in mainland China after the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War‚Äîa Great Offering to the Entire Firmament Lu√≥tiƒÅn D√†ji√†o)‚Äîoccurred at MtMian in 2001. MtMian was also one of the most important sites for the celebrations surrounding the anniversary of Lao-tze's birth in March 2003. The China National Tourism Administration named MtMian a AAAAA-rated tourist attraction in 2013.. A study by researchers from Shanxi University the same year, however, found that the routes through the scenic area remained insufficiently interconnected with one another and should be further optimized to increase the resort's capacity. Areas =Dragon Head Temple= This area includes over 20 sites, including the Dragon Head Temple and the Longmen Stone Arches.. The Dragon Head Temple supposedly takes its name from a pair of dragons who appeared to Li Shimin (\\"Emperor Taizong\\" of the Tang) during a visit to the mountain. =Dragon Ridge Peak= The Dragon Ridge Peak area includes a statue of Jie Zhitui with his mother, a Tang barracks, and a park with stone inscriptions about public health. The ridge is named for its appearance, thought to resemble two intersecting dragons. =Five Dragons' Traces= The Traces of the Five Dragons or Wulongchan are five gullies supposedly formed by the bodies of five dragons who visited MtMian to listen to a sermon by the Tang buddha Tian Zhichao. The Zhengguo Temple has 3 halls preserving the well- preserved remains of 12 other monks of the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties. Other sites in the valleys are the Shangfang Academy, the Five-Dragon Pine, the Lingyin Terrace, and the Tongtian Yunqu (\\"Cloud Thoroughfare Leading to Heaven\\"). =Guteng Valley= The Guteng or Ancient Vine Valley, also known as the Stream Gully, includes the path leading to the top of MtMian. It has abundant wildlife including pheasants and squirrels and various medicinal herbs, shrubbery, and wildflowers. It is particularly noted for its abundant and unusual vines, which entwine the valley's ancient trees and shade its medieval stone carvings.. =Lord Jie Ridge= The Lord Jie Ridge is the supposed site of Jie Zhitui's immolation by order of his close friend Duke Chong'er of Jin around 636. He came to be revered as a Taoist immortal, and his temple and tomb have been sites of pilgrimage since his death. In the 6th century , a charred grove of trees were also a major attraction, with some miracles recorded. The Lord Jie Shrine or Pavilion of the Divine Jie (t, s, Ji√®sh√©ng√©). is the biggest grotto temple in China, with two ellipsoid columns supporting a cave 22 meters high, 40 meters wide, and 25 meters deep (72√ó130√ó82 ft). Its altar faces a tall idol of Jie Zhitui, with smaller idols of his mother and Xie Zhang on each side. His legend is retold in dozens of reliefs on the cave's columns and walls. Cypress Ridge, also known as Baishu Ridge, covers a territory of about , covered with picturesque cyprus and including the tomb constructed for Jie Zhitui by Duke Chong'er of Jin. It is reached by a path including 2000 stone steps. Individually notable trees include the Qin Cypress, one of the largest in China; the Mother-and-Son Cypress, considered to represent Jie and his mother; and the Dragon-Shaped Cypress, whose roots extend down the cliffside. Yuan, Ming, and Qing tombs are also found scattered around the area. The Stele Forest includes diverse forms of Chinese calligraphy by about 100 people, including the emperor Li Shimin, the generals Zhang Liang and Wei Zheng, and the scholars Guo Tai and He Zhizhang. Many inscriptions retell the legends surrounding the mountain, particularly the stories of Jie Zhuitui. =Nun Lee Cliff= An area named after Princess Changzhao, a sister of Li Shimin who became a nun after experiencing a vision of the Buddha while visiting the mountain with the emperor in the spring of 641. The emperor built a temple for her, and the area is still decorated with Tang-era sculptures as well as the native cypresses and pines.. =Qixian Canyon= The Qixian Canyon (\\"Canyon for Wise People\\") is a winding and undulous gully traversed by path, suspension bridges, and ancient-style ladders. Apart from the mountains and foliage, the area is decorated with stone inscriptions, unique rocks, springs, and waterfalls.. =Shengru Spring= The spring, also known as Holy Breast or Stone Breast Spring, flows across dozens of rounded, moss-covered stones before falling into a wide pond. During the Kangxi Era (17th‚Äì18th century), the local writer Liang Xiheng compared the sounds of the water drops to notes played on the Chinese zither. Other nearby sites include Wangfeng Gate; the Three Emperors Pavilion; the Hall of the Saintly Mother; and the Temples of the Four Dragons, the Five Sacred Mountains, the Fujianese water goddess Mazu, and the five dragons paying respect to their mother. =Shuitao Gully= The Shuitao or Water Billowing Gully includes the most picturesque natural scenery on MtMian, with its path passing by and through thick forests and several dozen waterfalls. =Sky Bridge= The Sky Bridge is a plank road more than long but less than one meter (3ft) wide suspended below the mountain's ridge but above the valley floor. Mist and clouds sometimes collect below it, creating a heavenly scene. Other nearby sites are Rabbit Bridge; a cypress whose shape causes it to be known as the Wangbai Dragon; and medieval fortresses around Shile Village and Dongshen Palace. The latter is a Taoist temple built by Li Shimin of the Tang in honor of Lao-tze. =Temple of All-Embracing Heaven= The Temple of All-Embracing Heaven, also known as the Daluo Palace D√†lu√≥ G≈çng), is the largest on the mountain. It reached its present size of 13 stories during restoration work ordered by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang in 732. It is an important Taoist temple sometimes compared with Lhasa's Potala Palace. It has a stone inscription of Lao-tze's Tao Teh Ch'ing and (in its Baiyun Convent) another of the Buddhist Diamond Sutra. Its library supposedly houses China's largest repository of sutras.. =Yidou Spring= Yidou Spring is a freshwater spring thought to be shaped like the character . A local myth relates that in antiquity MtMian suffered a drought and became barren and desolate. The Primeval Lord of Heaven saw this and wet his brush in the East China Sea, then spread it along the length of the mountain. The land revived and grew a lush forest, with the largest drops becoming a number of springs around the mountain, including Yidou. The god is honored for this gift at the Dongzhen Palace, built inside a natural cave near the spring. Hanging sculptures decorate the cave with scenes from the Taoist understanding of the history of the universe. Other sites in the area include Elephant Trunk Hill, Deer Bridge, and the Gushan and Mountain-Fixing Rocks. =Yunfeng Temple= Yunfeng Temple Y√∫nfƒìng S√¨), also known as Baofu Temple, is located in the mountain's largest natural cave inside Baofu Rock. It was first built during the Three Kingdoms Period (3rd century), was refurbished by Li Shimin, and now contains more than 200 rooms. It is dedicated to the Tang buddha Tian Zhichao under his title of \\"King of Immateriality\\". His clay-entombed mummy resides in the center of the temple's main hall. The temple's other treasures include the Kaiyuan Tablet, a couplet by Fushan, and a plaque granted by the Guangxu Emperor of the Qing.. =Zhujia'ao Valley= Dongxuan Palace is a temple dedicated to the Lord of Lingbao. The rest of Zhujia'ao Valley is mostly associated with local legends about the family of the Hongwu Emperor, founder of China's Ming dynasty. Supposedly, his father Zhu Wusi had once come to the temples in the valley to worship Buddha and the other gods and returned to shower it with favor once his son ascended to the throne. Although Zhu had actually died before his son's enthronement, later Ming emperors visited MtMian to offer sacrifices and restore older temples.. =Others= Other notable sites within the scenic area are Yuanhao Slope, the Immortal Stone Forest, the Hujie and Mother-and-Son Stones, Lotus-Leaf Spring, White Crow and Turtle Mountains, and the Fire-Preventing Cave. Other surviving temples include the Bamboo Forest Temple and the Iron Tile Temple. Transportation The main road on MtMian now extends halfway up the peak. The paths to each major area are connected by bus routes. Events The temples have an annual celebration during the Cold Food Festival honoring Jie Zhitui in the three days on and around the Tomb Sweeping Festival. Area Taoists also continue to perform the Great Offering on the 28th day of the 4th month of the Chinese lunar calendar.

Biography Maskell was born in London in 1928 to Cuthbert Snowball Rewcastle, a judge, and Attracta Rewcastle, a doctor and the first female commissioned officer in the Royal Navy. She attended Tunbridge Wells Girls' Grammar School and Millfield before studying medicine at Somerville College, Oxford, graduating with a BA in physiology in 1950. She completed her clinical training at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London and qualified as MB ChB in 1953. After marrying John Maskell, a general practitioner, in 1954, she left medical practice for 14 years in order to raise a family. Maskell returned to medical practice in 1968 as a clinical assistant in the renal unit and public health laboratory at St Mary's Hospital in Portsmouth. There, she developed an interest in urinary tract infections, which became the focus of her career. She investigated women who experienced urinary symptoms but whose tests did not show bacteriuria and were therefore diagnosed with urethral syndrome or interstitial cystitis. She showed that these patients' urine cultures often grew bacteria that were usually dismissed as natural flora, and hypothesised that repeated antibiotic exposure caused these \\"normal\\" urethral bacteria to develop resistance. She set up a clinic for urinary tract infections, where she promoted research and discouraged the use of antibiotics and unnecessary investigations. Maskell published two books: Urinary tract infection (1982) and Urinary tract infection in clinical and laboratory practice (1988). Her honors included a Doctor of Medicine awarded by the University of Oxford in 1985 and election as Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1992. She retired in 1993, although she continued to publish academic papers until 2010, and died on 7 September 2016.

Early life and education Born in Newark, Ohio, Steinman moved to Los Angeles with his family as a young boy. His father was a chemist and chemical plant owner and his mother was a housewife. Steinman earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966 and his medical degree from Stanford University in 1971. Following medical school Steinman completed an internship at the Mayo Clinic. Steinman also has a Master of Public Health degree from the University of Washington. Career Attracted by the Coast Guard's image as the country's \\"premier search and rescue agency\\" he joined the USPHS in order to pursue his interests in emergency medicine. Steinman was commissioned by the USPHS as a lieutenant and assigned to the USCG in July 1972. Following graduation from the US Navy's aerospace medicine school at NAS Pensacola in 1973, Steinman qualified and served as a Coast Guard flight surgeon. As part of his duties as a flight surgeon, Steinman participated in numerous rescues at sea of ill and injured personnel. These occasionally required him to be lowered and recovered from vessels at sea by a helicopter rescue basket. With the exception of Coast Guard Base Kodiak, Steinman was the lone physician on staff at all of his field duty stations. During his time on active duty with the Coast Guard, Steinman was instrumental in establishing the Coast Guard's system of emergency medical services, including the establishment of the Coast Guard EMT School at Petaluma, California. He also established the Coast Guard Wellness Program, emphasizing good nutrition, physical fitness and avoidance of tobacco products. Steinman is best known, however, for his research into sea-survival, hypothermia and drowning, publishing numerous scientific articles and book chapters and making numerous presentations at medical and search and rescue conferences on these topics. In 1989, the Aerospace Medical Association awarded Steinman its annual Arnold D. Tuttle Award in recognition of \\" 'his extraordinary series of studies which characterized the protective properties of antiexposure suits under real-world conditions,' culminating in the 1987 publication in Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine of 'Immersion hypothermia: comparative protection of anti-exposure garments in calm vs. rough seas.' \\" Steinman also co-developed an underwater escape breathing device and anti-exposure garment for use by helicopter crews and \\"a heated, humidified oxygen system for treating hypothermic patients.\\" In 1993, Steinman was selected for promotion to flag officer to serve as the Coast Guard Director of Health and Safety. Steinman retired from the USPHS in 1997 and later served on the Presidential Special Oversight Board for Department of Defense Investigations of Gulf War Chemical and Biological Incident investigating Gulf War syndrome.

The three flag officers were made available to the Times by the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network in a move timed to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the Clinton administration's \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" (DADT) policy concerning U.S. military service by gays and lesbians. At the time, Kerr, Richard, and Steinman were the highest-ranking members of the military to publicly acknowledge being gay and they did so in an attempt to foment dialogue with the aim of getting DADT changed. In 2008, Steinman joined 103 other generals and admirals in signing an open letter calling upon President-elect Barack Obama to end DADT and allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the U.S. military. In 2014, Steinman joined with former US Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders to co-chair the Transgender Military Service Commission, sponsored by the Palm Center. Among other things, the Commission found: \\"There is no compelling medical rationale for banning transgender military service, and medical regulations requiring the discharge of all transgender personnel are inconsistent with how the military regulates medical and psychological conditions.\\" The Commission's final report was published in the journal Armed Forces & Society.

It was recorded at Guerrilla Recording in Oakland, California, and was released by Accretions Records in San Diego, California in 2003. The quartet was first proposed by Glick Rieman to Frith, with whom he had worked at Mills College in Oakland. Frith added Dalaba to the project, and Glick Rieman, Frith and Dalaba performed with John Zorn at Derek Bailey's Incus Festival at Tonic in New York City.

Reception In a review of the album at AllMusic, Fran√ßois Couture wrote that there is \\"[a] beautiful level of understanding\\" between the four musicians, and that while the music is improvised, it \\"sounds deeply structured\\". He praised \\"Worm Anvils\\", which he described as \\"long, slow, delicate, and full of mesmerizing sounds, courtesy of Glick Rieman\\".

Biography Leolinda Daltro was born in the state of Bahia. She moved to Rio de Janeiro with her second husband and five children to teach. In 1896 she travelled throughout the countryside in a mission to give formal education to Brazilian indigenous peoples and help to assimilate them to the newly formed Republic. She established herself among the Xerente people of the current state of Tocantins. Differently of the religious missions, Leolinda believed in a secular education for the natives, and she advocated for demarcation of their lands and respecting their cultures.

Nucl. Acids. Res.,35, W375‚ÄìW383. (iv) the distribution of the side-chain conformers (rotamers)Shapovalov, M.S., and Dunbrack, R.L., Jr. A smoothed backbone- dependent rotamer library for proteins derived from adaptive kernel density estimates and regressions. Structure., 2001, 19, 844-858. and, (v) hydrogen bonding parameters.Hooft, R.W.W., Sander, C., and Vriend, G., Positioning hydrogen atoms by optimizing hydrogen-bond networks in protein structures. Proteins., 1996, 26, 363-376. The advent of the complementarity plot as a structural validation tool for proteins essentially provides a conjugation of the traditional approaches. CP detects both local errors in atomic coordinates and also correctly matches an amino acid sequence to its native three dimensional fold situated amid decoys. The Complementarity Plot is based on the combined use of shape and electrostatic complementarity of completely / partially buried residues with respect to their environment constituted by rest of the polypeptide chain and is a sensitive indicator of the harmony or disharmony of interior residues with regard to the short and long range forces sustaining the native fold. The term 'Complementarity Plot' (CP) is perhaps a misnomer as there are actually three plots, each serving a given range of solvent exposure of the plotted residues (CP1, CP2, CP3 for burial bins 1, 2, 3).  Pictorial description  The complementarity plot has been largely inspired by the Ramachnadran Plot in its design (but not in its physicochemical attributes). Ramachandran Plot is deterministic in nature, in contrast, CP is probabilistic. Ramachandran plot deals with main-chain torsion angles and errors in such parameters are essentially locally restricted. In contrast, CP deals with geometric and electrostatic fit of the interior side- chains with their local and non-local neighborhood. Disharmony (misfit) in these conjugated parameters may arise due to a plethora of errors coming from bond angles or torsions from effectively the whole folded polypeptide chain. However, analogous to the Ramachandran Plot, the region within the first contour is termed 'probable' (analogous to the 'allowed' region), between the first and second contour, 'less probable' ('partially allowed') and outside the second contour 'improbable' ('disallowed').  Applications  CP has a multitude of applications in experimental as well as in computational structural biology. Thorough investigation of the effect of small errors in both main- and side-chain bond angles / torsions on the overall fold shows that the CP is effective in the detection of these errors even while failure of the other already existing parameters based on prohibition of local steric overlap and deviation from ideality. Consequences of such small angular errors are not restricted locally, resulting in geometric and electrostatic misfit of interior residues throughout the fold, potentially detectable by the CPs. These errors may arise from (i) misfitting of side-chain torsions/ wrong rotamer assignments (especially relevant for low-resolution structures), (ii) incorrect tracing of the main-chain trajectories during refinement (resulting in low-intensity errors diffused over the entire polypeptide chain). CP can also detect packing anomalies, and, in particular, can potentially signal unbalanced partial charges within protein interiors. It is useful in homology modeling and protein design. A version of the plot (CPint) has also been built and made available to probe similar errors in protein-protein interfaces.  CPdock:  CPdock In contrast to the residue-wise plots, there is also a variant available for the Complementarity Plot, namely CPdock for plotting single Sc, EC values for the protein-protein interface and adjudging thereby the quality of the complex atomic structure (either experimentally solved or computationally built) therein. Sc, EC are shape and electrostatic complementarities computed for 'interacting protein-protein surfaces' originally proposed by Peter Colman and co-workers in the 1990s. CPdock was primarily developed as a scoring function to serve as an initial filter in protein-protein docking and can be a very helpful tool in protein design .

She worked in bleeding disorders, particularly haemophilia, and established the haemophilia service at the Royal Free Hospital in London. Biography Katharine Baker was born in 1926 in Oxford; her father was George Brindley Aufrere Baker, an air vice-marshal in the Royal Air Force. She enrolled at the London School of Medicine for Women in 1945 and graduated as MBBS in 1951. The same year, she married Thomas Dormandy, one of the first male students at the school, which had been renamed the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine. She held house and registrar posts at the Royal Free Hospital and Central Middlesex Hospital until 1954, when she qualified as a member of the Royal College of Physicians. For two years, she performed research at Central Middlesex and St Mary's Hospital, and in 1956 she took up a registrar position in haematology at Great Ormond Street Hospital, where she worked mainly with haemophiliac boys. In 1964, she returned to the Royal Free Hospital as an honorary consultant and senior lecturer in haematology. After her appointment at the Royal Free, Dormandy set about establishing a haemophilia centre at the hospital. The service initially ran out of a caravan parked outside the hospital that had been donated by the Haemophilia Society. Dormandy also campaigned for the creation of a special boarding school for haemophiliacs, since many were forced to miss large amounts of school. Her plans for a dedicated school did not eventuate, but her work led to the adoption of treatment facilities at Treloar School, a school for the disabled, which then attracted more haemophiliac students. By 1970, the haemophilia centre at the Royal Free had expanded to utilise the veranda of an existing ward; although its premises were located in a caravan and a veranda, it was designated an \\"international centre\\" by the World Federation of Haemophilia. Dormandy was appointed a university reader in 1970 and was awarded a Doctor of Medicine for a thesis on von Willebrand disease. In 1977, she was elected Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and received the inaugural gold medal of the Haemophilia Society, named for Robert Gwyn Macfarlane. Dormandy died from cancer on 30 May 1978. A dedicated building for haematology was constructed at the Royal Free in 1978, but Dormandy died before it was finished; it was named the Katharine Dormandy Haemophilia Centre.

He joined Blackpool of the First Division in February 1948, and played regularly for the reserve team in the Central League, but again played no part for the first team. A year later he was back in the north-east with Blackhall Colliery Welfare, moving on to Brandon Colliery Welfare before returning to Horden Colliery Welfare for the 1949‚Äì50 season. After injury to first-choice goalkeeper Jack Washington, Maddison played in the FA Cup tie against Billingham Synthonia, the winner to visit League club Stockport County in the first round proper. Horden lost. Maddison returned to the Football League in 1950 with Darlington of the Third Division North. He finally made his league debut on 26 March 1951, deputising for the long-serving Billy Dunn in the local derby at home to Hartlepools United, played in a snowstorm on a quagmire of a Feethams pitch dotted with pools of standing water.

From the Rudall their land ran north as far as the Paterson Range. Their eastern frontier lay at Mount Broadhurst Range and Rooney Creek, while their western boundary was marked by the Throssell Range.

Points-based immigration systems are sometimes also referred to as merit-based immigration systems, Countries that use points-based immigration systems may have other pathways for potential immigrants (such as immediate family, refugees, etc.), so that meeting the points threshold is not necessary for all immigrants. They may also have additional criteria that points-based immigrants need to satisfy, such as no criminal record or no involvement with terrorist organizations. Some countries that use points-based immigration systems are the United Kingdom (see main article), Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Canada and Australia are the two countries with the most experience with the points-based system, and are often used as the comparison points when judging whether a country's immigration system is points-based.Kelly Buchanan, Tariq Ahmad, & Clare Feikert-Ahalt. (2013, March). Points-Based Immigration Systems. The Law Library of Congress, Global Legal Research Center. Retrieved from https://www.loc.gov/law/help/points-based-immigration/Points- Based%20Immigration%20Systems.pdf  Points-based systems by country  = Canada = Canada was the first country to introduce a points-based immigration system, doing so in 1967. The change came as Canada was moving past an immigration system that distinguished based on race and country of origin. The new system favored youth, education, experience and fluency in English or French, i.e., broad human capital as opposed to a specific job offer or job-specific skills. The points-based immigration system has been identified as one of the factors in the change in Canada's immigrant distribution from 85% European to 15% European and leveled the field of immigration.The minimum points necessary to enter the country is 67 points, however, the number of points vary among countries. More efficient immigration and hiring is done because of this system. There is some evidence that immigrants entering under the points system have experienced better outcomes in CanadaWarman, C., Webb, M. D., & Worswick, C. (2019). Immigrant category of admission and the earnings of adults and children: How far does the apple fall? Journal of Population Economics, 32(1), 53-112. doi:http://dx.doi.org.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca/10.1007/s00148-018-0700-5 . In response to lower and declining labor force participation among people admitted through the points-based system relative to native Canadian workers, two reasons were identified: lack of recognition by Canadian employers of foreign educational degrees, and poor language fluency. As a result, the government changed its points-based system to weigh English and French language fluency more heavily. The system was also changed so that any skilled applicant with a job offer scores higher than any applicant without. The application process was again revamped due to the gap between a foreign candidate and an employer and reduced the points for job offer, they also changed the system to an invitation to immigrate method that allows an open expression of interest with the option the pool of candidates can remain a year or two in the system to meet the frequently published \\"lottery point\\" and get invited. The lack of visibility of qualified immigrant candidate profiles in the job bank for the employers and hiring agencies in reaching out with a job offer was observed to lag the process. The last major change to Canada's points-based system took place in January 2015 upon the federal government's launch of Express Entry. Up until Express Entry's introduction, Canada struggled to manage its intake of applications since it received more applications than its available immigration spots. The backlogs were due to Canada processing applications in the order in which they received. In other words, Canada reviewed each application, which was a time-consuming process. Canada formally moved away from this approach when it launched Express Entry. Express Entry is a more dynamic application management system, since it enables the Canadian government to only process the applications of the highest-scoring candidates. This system has eliminated backlogs and reduced the application processing standard to six months or less. = Australia = In 1972, the Labor Government elected in Australia decided migrants would be granted a visa based on personal attributes and ability to contribute to Australian society. In 1989, Australia formalized a points-based immigration system similar to Canada's (The Economist gives a date of 1979 for initial rollout of the policy). Like Canada, Australia switched to the points-based system as it was transitioning out of its history of race-based (Briton- focused, white-only) immigration policy. Australia's experience of the system is unique with smaller changes in regulations and diverse options through provincial programs. Australia shifted to an application process where people were invited to express interest if they meet a required-straight forward score and the applicants would be invited per labour market requirements within a year or two after being in the pool.http://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-australias-points-system- for-immigration-26065 In 2017, Australia's points-based system was cited as an inspiration and was raised as an elegant point during discussions of immigration policy in the United Kingdom in the context of Brexit. It has also been cited in the context of Donald Trump's interest in making the United States immigration system more merit-based and reducing its focus on extended family migration after the Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull announced putting \\"Australians first\\" through a Facebook video.https://www.facebook.com/malcolmturnbull/videos/10155311599176579/ = United Kingdom = Between 2008 and 2010, the U. K. phased in a points-based immigration system for regulating immigration from outside the European Economic Area. The Economist reports that the system did not evolve into a points-based system like that of Australia or Canada due to the numerous special exemptions carved out by various interest groups, and subsequent slashing of immigration under the Tory government. However, specialty based immigration is open in the United Kingdom. = New Zealand = Prior to 1987 New Zealand almost entirely focused immigration on ethnicity. A rudimentary system of skills based immigration was legislated for in 1987 and a simplified points system came into being later in 1991.  Initial assumptions of points- based systems  = Points-based systems that incorporate job offers and language fluency can lead to better immigrant employment rates = Both Canada and Australia began with points-based systems focused more on human capital than on specific job offers, but both found through experience that this resulted in lower immigrant employment rates compared with natives or with immigrants in certain states and provinces. This led Madeleine Sumption of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University to claim that \\"pure\\" point systems \\"don't work.\\" Both countries modified their points-based systems to take job offers into account. But this didn't open window for job opportunities or an open channel for immigrant candidates and employers; additional paperwork and lack of channels have been observed resulting in low rates of immigration and many have reverted or reduced points required in these factors. = Points- based systems require frequent tweaking = Demetrios Papademetriou of the Migration Policy Institute argued, based on the frequent tweaking of criteria used by Canada and Australia, that points-based systems require frequent tweaking in order to be successful. Given the slow pace of United States immigration legislation, he argued that this required a greater level of planning for the bureaucracy than seen in the United States immigration system, so to gain autonomy for the implementation of a points-based system would be a challenge for the United States. Proposals in the United States In the United States, President Donald Trump and his administration, as well as some Republicans, support the RAISE Act, which proposed legislation to steeply cut legal immigration to the United States. In addition to substantially reducing legal immigration to the United States, and dramatically reducing family-based immigration, the bill would also replace the current employment-based U.S. visa with a rigid points system.The RAISE Act: What Lies Beneath the Proposed Points System?, American Immigration Council (August 11, 2017). Under the legislation, a maximum of 140,000 points- based immigrant visas would be issued per fiscal year, with spouses and minor children of the principal applicant being counted against the 140,000 cap. The legislation would eliminate the current demand-driven, employer-led model, in which employment-based visas are directly responsive to the needs of the labor market, and would move to a model in which potential migrants would be primarily valued by human capital factors. The points system proposed in the act would prioritize \\"individuals who are already U.S.-educated, trained in STEM fields, highly-compensated, English-fluent, and young\\" while disadvantaging \\"women, people who work in the informal economy (including those who do unpaid work), individuals with family ties to U.S. citizens but without formal education and employment history, middle-aged and older adults, and applicants from less-developed countries.\\"  References  Immigration ","title":"Points-based immigration system"},{"id":"55875867","text":"Le Courrier de l'Atlas is a French newspaper specialising in reporting about issues regarding the Maghreb in Europe.

These forts are normally a hastily-constructed hiding place made by moving products on shelves in such a way that the participants can hide behind them, although some participants have carried out the challenge simply by hiding in areas such as public toilets and staff-only areas. Once the location closes, the goal is to remain in the venue for as long as possible before the location reopens in the morning, or until the building's staff or security apprehend the participants. Several store chains and companies have spoken out against the challenge, and participants risk being banned from stores or facing criminal charges for trespassing, criminal damage and breaking and entering.

Pura Goa Lawah is often included among the Sad Kahyangan Jagad, or the \\"six sanctuaries of the world\\", the six holiest places of worship on Bali. Pura Goa Lawah is noted for built around a cave opening which is inhabited by bats, hence its name, the Goa Lawah or \\"bat cave\\". Description Pura Goa Lawah is located in the village of Pesinggahan, Klungkung Regency, Bali. The large complex of Pura Goa Lawah is located on the north side of Jalan Raya Goa Lawah main road, on the beach of Goa Lawah. Pura Goa Lawah is sometimes included among the Sad Kahyangan Jagad, or the \\"six sanctuaries of the world\\", the six holiest places of worship on Bali. According to Balinese beliefs, they are the pivotal points of the island and are meant to provide spiritual balance to Bali. The number of these most sacred sanctuaries always adds up six, but depending on the region, the specific temples that are listed may vary. History Pura Goa Lawah in early 20th-century, showing porcelain ceramic plates decoration. Pura Goa Lawah was established in the 11th century by Mpu Kuturan. Mpu Kuturan was one of the early priests who introduced Hinduism on Bali. The temple complex may start as the center of meditation for priests. When the Dutch attacked the Klungkung kingdom of 1849 in the War of Kusamba, the temple was one of the key points during the war. The conflict in the War of Kusamba was between the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army led by Andreas Victor Michiels and the Klungkung kingdom led by Dewa Agung Istri Kanya. Carving at Pura Goa Lawah The temple decoration evolves as time progress. In the early 20th-century, porcelain ceramic plates attached into the shrines and gates of Pura Goa Lawah are common. This treatment can still be found in other old temples in Bali such as Pura Kehen. Today, the porcelain ceramic plates decoration on the shrines and gates has been reduced. Temple compound Bat temple ornaments inlaid with gold at Pura Goa Lawah. The compound of Pura Goa Lawah is built over a hilly outcrop. It is divided into three areas: the outer sanctum of the temple (jaba pisan or nistaning mandala), the middle sanctum (jaba tengah or madya mandala), and the inner main sanctum (jero or utamaning mandala). The entrance to the temple complex is marked with a candi bentar gate. A bale kulkul (pavilion to keep a drum) is placed to the west of this entrance. Within the first courtyard of the temple, the outer sanctum or the jaba pisan, there are three pavilions (bale) located in three corners of the temple complex. One of the pavilions is the bale gong, where the gamelan set is kept for musical performance. Access to the middle sanctum or jaba tengah is located to the west of the outer sanctum. Three paduraksa portals mark the entrance to the innermost sanctum of the temple (jero). The inner main sanctum consists of three meru towers, one of which is dedicated to Shiva. Several smaller shrines are nested into a cave, where hordes of nectar bats rest. The entrance to the mouth of the cave is marked with the candi bentar gates. Other shrines is a bale pavilion adorned with motifs of Naga Basuki flanking its steps. Naga Basuki is a primordial dragon who is believed to keep the balance of the cosmos.

Reception Scott Yanow of Allmusic wrote: \\"This 1986 recording started her artistic \\"comeback\\" and showed that she had developed and matured during her years in Europe. Backed by her regular French rhythm section, Bridgewater is in spirited and creative form.... Her arrival as a major singer in the years since this set has been a welcome event. Recommended.\\" Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News noted, \\"Terrific. Until a whole new wave of singers came along in the '80s, expatriate Bridgewater was one of the precious few keeping alive the tradition of jazz song... Living in Paris has done her good. She has -- literally -- never been better than this.\\" Jack Fuller of the Chicago Tribune stated: \\"Here\`s one for the permanent collection. Dee Dee Bridgewater has what only a few jazz singers each generation has-the ideas, the energy and the vocal equipment to make the music complete. Bridgewater delivers on everything from the Erroll Garner standard, 'Misty,' to the down and dirty 'Dr. Feelgood' and 'Medley Blues.' And when she improvises, it has just the right balance of reference and innovaton. The references may be to Sarah Vaughan, Carmen McRae, and Betty Carter, but you'd better think of adding Dee Dee Bridgewater to the short list of standards.\\" Track listing Personnel Band *Dee Dee Bridgewater ‚Äì vocals *Herv√© Sellin ‚Äì piano *Antoine Bonfils ‚Äì bass *Andr√© Ceccarelli ‚Äì drums Production *Jean-Pierre Grosz ‚Äì producer *Jean-Pierre Gouache ‚Äì recording engineer *Jean- Louis Bucchi ‚Äì mixing  References   External links  * Dee Dee Bridgewater live albums 1987 live albums ","title":"Live in Paris (Dee Dee Bridgewater album)"},{"id":"55876365","text":"The Jordan Basketball Federation is the governing body of basketball in Jordan.

Justice (May 30, 1879 in Logansport, Cass County, Indiana - May 7, 1915 in North Atlantic) was an American chemist and the president of the United States Chemical Company. thumb Anne Shymer, photo taken by family on May 1, 1915 Life Anne Shymer was born in 1879 in the small city of Logansport in Indiana. Her mother Grace Justice supported Anne's interest in chemistry and ensured that she received a wide range of education. Anne studied at the University of Cornell. She married a wealthy man named Paterson. The couple lived in Great Britain until Paterson died unexpectedly. The young widow moved back to the United States and resumed her work. She conducted various experiments and multiple test series in a private laboratory in New York City. On January 16, 1911, Shymer married the British businessman Robert D. Shimer and Americanized his surname to Shymer. The couple separated after only four weeks. In the meantime, Anne achieved her biggest success as a chemist and founded the United States Chemical Corporation. Among other things, she discovered a bleach for textiles and a germicidal substance that could be used especially in hospitals. Her achievements brought her recognition and prestige; shortly afterwards, she enjoyed world-wide attention. Shymer received an invitation from Britain's prime minister H. H. Asquith and his wife. In 1915, King George V.'s Physician heard of Shymer's accomplishments and was impressed. On May 1, 1915, Shymer boarded the British luxury liner RMS Lusitania, which was supposed to travel from New York to Liverpool, England. She was going to be introduced at St James to King George and Queen Mary of England. Apart from that, she also wanted to establish new contacts and patent her newest formulae. Before she departed, she wanted to proceed with the divorce of her husband but was hindered because she didn't know where he currently was. On the day of her departure, her mother, her sister Maibelle Justice and other relatives came to Pier 54 to say good bye. Because the departure took longer than expected, her family took a last picture of Shymer. This picture, in which she is smiling and props her left arm self-confidently on the railing on the B-Deck promenade, is one of the most popular pictures associated with the Lusitania catastrophe. Six days later, in the early afternoon of May 7, 1915, Lusitania was sunk by a German submarine boat U2 0 with a torpedo. The ship sank within a few minutes and took two-thirds of the passengers and crew with it. Shymer was able to get to her cabin B-98 and take her jewelry, that she wore completely in order to not lose it. What happened to her afterwards is unknown. Her corpse was one of the first found and received the number #66. The jewelry that she wore was worth about US$4000 in 1915. On its way back from Ireland to the American embassy in London, the jewelry vanished and has not been seen since. Shymer's dead body was returned to her family in the United States. Shymer's husband, as well as her mother and sister, sued the Cunard Line for compensation, because of the loss of their relative. Robert Shimer's lawsuit was dropped because he had been living apart from his wife for four years. Grace and Maibelle Justice's lawsuit was settled in October 1925, more than ten years after the incident. Shymer's mother was already dead at that point in time. Maibelle Heikes Justice got US$7,527.

Biography  Isabella Moncrieff was the daughter of Reverend Henry Moncrieff- Wellwood and Susan Barclay. In 1803 she married Sir John Stoddart, who was Chief Justice of Malta, and came to also be known as Lady Stoddart. In 1819 she published her first book The Eskdale Herd-Boy under the pen name of Martha Blackford. The subtitle of the book refers to the aim of \\"instructing young people\\" and to this Moncrieff further explained that her purpose was to create characters that could \\"impress on the minds of her young readers, the permanent advantages of early integrity and gratitude\\". The American Sunday School Magazine criticised the portrayal of characters that were \\"not always the most natural\\" and labelled the work as \\"deficient\\" and therefore stated it was not suitable for young audiences. On the other hand, The London Magazine called it \\"a very superior work, and we have read it ourselves with much interest\\" and Chronicle of the Times mentioned her as having acquired an \\"enviable standing in the literary circles\\". In 1822 she published The Scottish Orphans: A Moral Tale, which is set at the times of the Jacobite rising of 1745. She explained in the introduction that she was motivated by \\"having been eagerly solicited by her two nephews\\" to write again and thinking of the interest the Jacobite rebellion could have in juvenile readers. She then continued to publish moral tales and in a promotion of Annals of the Family of McRoy she restated her \\"earnest desire to contribute toward improving the principles and correcting the errors of the rising generation\\". Nevertheless, in Annals of the Family of McRoy she changed her focus to older characters, in this case following two women leaving their maternal home, so as to provide \\"instruction and amusement\\" to older audiences. Most of her novels are set in Scotland. Moncrieff explained that she did this in order to get English readers to have a sense of \\"the manners and habits of their northern neighbors\\" and to impress them with \\"the grandeur of the Scottish scenery\\". She died in 1846 and was survived by her husband and numerous children.

In January 1977, Annie Walsh was beaten to death in her home in Manchester, England and Brown was first interrogated and beaten by the police officers investigating this crime. Under duress, Brown signed a confession and was found guilty at trial. He maintained his innocence throughout his prison sentence even going so far as denying himself parole by not admitting to the crime. He was released on appeal in 2002 and is thought to be one of the longest serving victims of a miscarriage of justice in the United Kingdom. Background Brown grew up in Kilbowie in Dumbartonshire and was placed into care when he was nine years old by his mother after he witnessed his dad beating her up. At the age of 15 he took himself out of care and returned home where he and his father \\"came to blows\\". His dad threw him out soon afterwards. Brown admits that he partook in a life of petty crime. He later moved to Manchester to make \\"a fresh start\\" after going to a football match in the city. Whilst in Manchester he met a girl, Cathy Shaw, who later became his girlfriend. On 31 January 1977, factory worker Annie Walsh, who was 51 at the time, was found battered to death in her flat in Charles Barry Crescent, Hulme, Greater Manchester by a man who had come to read the electricity meter. She had been hit over the head sixteen times and her blood was splattered over the furniture, walls and ceiling. A Home Office pathologist estimated that she had lain undiscovered for two to three days after the murder, (she was last seen alive on 28 January 1977). Police were so concerned about the frenzied nature of the attack that they consulted mental units in case someone had escaped. In May 1977, the police went to the flat that Brown shared with his girlfriend Cathy; it was in the same block of flats where Annie Walsh had lived and been murdered. He was originally arrested for non-payment of a fine and was taken in for questioning without his rights being read to him and held for 32 hours without legal representation.Some sources state 36 hours. At the trial, Brown stated that the confession was beaten and coerced out of him and when he did ask for a lawyer, he was told by the policemen that \\"only guilty men need a lawyer\\". The trial was presided over by Judge Helenus Milmo who directed the jury's attention to the fact that it came down to whether or not they believed the police, or whether they believed Brown was innocent. The jury convicted Brown of murder and Judge Milmo sentenced him to life with a minimum term of 15 years. Appeals Brown appealed the sentencing in 1978, but the appeal was turned down. An appeal was lodged again with then Home Secretary, Michael Howard in 1993, but this was also denied in the following year. Whilst in prison, Brown was caught in what Simon Hattenstone, writing in The Guardian, describes as \\"the Miscarriage of Justice Catch-22\\" (the Innocent prisoner's dilemma); because he would not admit his guilt in the crime for which he was imprisoned, he could not be rehabilitated and be deemed fit to be put in front of a parole board. Brown refused the chance of parole from a point of view that investigative journalist Eamonn O'Neill called a point of logic; \\"how could he be paroled for a crime that he did not commit?\\". Whilst in prison, Brown shared a cell with Paul Hill, one of the Guildford Four, who, after having his conviction quashed and then released, later campaigned against Brown's miscarriage of justice. The case was again referred to the Court of Appeal in 2002 by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC). Release An appeal court in November 2002 decided that Brown should be allowed to go free after declaring his conviction unsafe. The appeal was due to be heard over two days, but the judges at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, quashed the conviction within minutes when the Counsel for the Crown explained that he could not argue the case on the evidence presented before the court; the appeal lasted only 18 minutes before it was deemed an 'unsafe conviction'. The appeal court had heard evidence that the fibres on Walsh's coat had not matched to Brown, but to another man who was questioned about the murder at the same time. This evidence was not given in court. Linguistic analysis of Brown's confession was given in evidence stating that it could not have been dictated to the police officers by Brown as the police had said. A pair of blood-soaked jeans had also been used against Brown in his interrogation with the police claiming they were the ones that Brown had used in the murder. In fact, they belonged to a woman who had suffered a miscarriage in them and the police knew this. The sight of the jeans being presented in court made Brown burst into tears as he had known the woman who had had the miscarriage in them; this was misinterpreted as guilt of the murder on his part by the people in the court. The three judges presiding over Brown's 2002 appeal heard evidence which, in their summing up, prompted them to describe the arresting officers in Brown's case to be part of a \\"culture of corruption and a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice\\". Detective Superintendent Peter Topping of Greater Manchester Police had written a report in the 1980s detailing corruption practices within the force during the 1970s and beyond. Despite the report containing circumstantial evidence that could have alleviated Brown's time in prison, it was not made available to his legal team until a few days before the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction because of a Public-Interest Immunity certificate concerning the report. Aftermath Since his release, Brown has been campaigning for reforms to the legal system. He was also given compensation for his 25-year prison sentence, of which the government demanded back ¬£100,000 for which they deemed payment for bed and board whilst he was in prison. Brown is believed to be one of the longest serving victims of a miscarriage of justice in the United Kingdom. Cathy Shaw, Brown's girlfriend in 1977, died in 1992 at the age of 35 from alcohol poisoning. Brown and Shaw's family both attribute her death to how his conviction affected her. It was later revealed that Brown could not take legal action against any of the police officers who were responsible for his fake confession or beatings. An investigation found \\"insufficient evidence\\" of misconduct in relation to Brown's detention, interviews or arrest. Detective Chief Inspector Jack Butler was sentenced to four years in jail after being found guilty of accepting bribes and perverting the course of justice in 1983, but that was in relation to another case not related to Robert Brown's. At Brown's Court of Appeal hearing in 2002, his defending counsel said of Butler that \\"not only was he involved in corruption himself but he presided over a conspiracy of corruption amongst other officers at Platt Lane police station [in Fallowfield, Manchester] between 1973 and 1979.\\" Butler resigned from the police force in 1983. In September 2004, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) informed Robert Brown that there would be no prosecution of the police officers involved in his arrest and interrogation. In the same year, Channel 4 screened a documentary about Brown's case which was entitled Picking Up the Pieces. A review in The Guardian described it as \\"searing stuff\\". In early 2005, Greater Manchester Police announced that they had reopened the investigation into Annie Walsh's murder.

Throughout active musical-stage career, Ilhama Guliyeva gained popular success in her respective genre of music and received such major state-level honors as Honored Artist of Azerbaijani SSR in 1982, People's Artist of the Republic of Azerbaijan in 1998 and People's Artist of the Republic of Dagestan in 2007.  Biography  = Early life = Ilhama Guliyeva was born on 17 August 1943 in K√ºrd…ôxanƒ±, Azerbaijani SSR. Her mother ‚Äì , was a popular Azerbaijani singer and khanende, and father ‚Äì Mazahir Guliyev, worked as a prosecutor in Lankaran. Due to his job appointment, Ilhama Guliyeva spent her very early years in Shaki city of Azerbaijan. However, when Ilhama reaches the age of six, her parents divorce. Ilhama Guliyeva's mother, moving to Baku, marries a famous Azerbaijani tar player ‚Äì , who later becomes a supportive stepfather that actively engages in growing up and educating Ilhama Guliyeva. = Education = At this early age, she gets enrolled in a 7-year musical school for piano training in Baku. As Guliyeva finishes both musical and high schools, with a great desire she wants to build her profession in the musical field. Nevertheless, young Ilhama faces definitive dissent from her parents. Taking into account the difficulties of music, they try to inspire her to master another art. Therefore, she enters the faculty of philology of the Azerbaijan State University in 1960 and continues non-musical studies in subsequent years. In 1964, Ilhama Guliyeva graduates from the university, but like every talented person with high musical intelligence, young Guliyeva could not get away from music. = Early musical career = In 1963, with the support of Ziniat Alizadeh, who was in close relations with Guliyeva's family, she starts performing at the university's \\"Sevinj\\" pop ensemble. As Guliyeva's parents still oppressed her passion for music, these musical activities were kept in secret from her family. In 1964, a competition of young talents from all over the world was held in Moscow. By the request of Mrs. Zinyat, Ilhama Guliyeva gets permission from her family and flies to Russia. Her family thought she was going to the festival as a spectator. Competing with young singers from many countries, Ilhama Guliyeva performs the songs of Rauf Hajiyev and Tofig Guliyev. As Guliyeva becomes the winner of the competition, she returns to Baku and gets invited to perform at the orchestra of the Azerbaijan State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company (AzTV). Starting from 1965 until 1970, Ilhama Gulliyeva starts performing songs composed by Khayyam Mirzazade, Tofig Bakikhanov and Emin Sabitoglu in various genres of pop music, such as slow rock, jazz, R & B, soul and blues, as a soloist of the orchestra, headed by . = 1970s ‚Äì 1980s = From 1970 until 1980, Ilhama Guliyeva performed at various stages as a soloist of the Azerbaijan State Philharmonic Hall. In 1972, \\"The Evening of Azerbaijani Composers\\" gets held in the House of the Unions in Moscow where Guliyeva performs several songs. After the concert, a promimnent Azerbaijani composer Fikrat Amirov meets with Guliyeva and promises to compose art songs for her. Such songs as \\"M…ôn s…ôni araram\\", \\"G√∂y G√∂l\\", \\"G√ºl√ºr ell…ôr g√ºl√ºr\\", \\"G√ºl…ôr…ôm g√ºls…ôn\\", \\"Toy mahnƒ±sƒ±/Toydur bug√ºn\\" and \\"De g√∂r√ºm neyl…ômi≈ü…ôm\\" became wonderful musical outputs of their cooperation, which went down in history of Azerbaijani music since then. Each of these songs is accompanied by folk instruments and orchestra, and has its own unique and colorful shades peculiar to Azerbaijani folk music. In the late 1970s, accompanied by the Musical ensemble \\"Dan Ulduzu\\", which was headed by Gulala Aliyeva, Ilhama Guliyeva performs many art songs of such outstanding Azerbaijani composers as , , , Arif Malikov, Ahmad Bakikhanov etc. Since then, Ilhama Guliyeva goes on tours to foreign countries (England, Spain, Denmark, Turkey, (Germany) etc.) and represents Azerbaijani music on the world stage. = 1990s ‚Äì 2000s = After the death of in 1994, stopped performing and quit the musical stage. This heavily affects Ilhama Guliyeva, and she quits singing for a short period of time. After several years, Guliyeva starts to cooperate with an Azerbaijani composer and performs such popular in Azerbaijan lyrical songs as \\"Neyl…ôrs…ôn\\", \\"Kaman\\", \\"Bils…ôn nec…ô darƒ±xmƒ±≈üam\\" etc. In the beginning of the first decade of the 2000s, Guliyeva performed such songs as \\"Gedir…ôm\\", \\"Unut M…ôni\\", \\"Unuda bilm…ôzs…ôn\\" and \\"Ya≈üƒ±n n…ô f…ôrqi var ki?/Love knows no age\\" which became appellative and the most popular song of Guliyeva's repertoire. This and other series of lyrical songs of Guliyeva contributed to transformation of Azerbaijani music. Since the beginning of the second decade of the 2000s, Guliyeva became the venerable elderly artist in the field of music in Azerbaijan, and young artists began making cover versions of art songs that she used to sing. = Socio-political activity = In the beginning of the 2000s, Ilhama Guliyeva publicly supports a new candidate for presidency ‚Äì Ilham Aliyev. She gives concerts in the regions of Azerbaijan, runs her propaganda and makes a worthy contribution to Ilham Aliyev's successful election. Moreover, in 2002, Guliyeva receives the status of \\"International Cultural Executor\\" at the World Women's Congress in Beirut, the title of \\"The Art Queen of the Turkic World\\" in Turkey and four Humay Awards in Azerbaijan.ƒ∞lham…ô Quliyevanƒ±n m…ôh…ôbb…ôt d√ºsturu Since 2003, together with a group of intelligent Azerbaijani women, Ilhama Guliyeva participated in several UN Geneva meetings and defended the rights of Azerbaijani women and children who had been affected by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. In 2004, at various conferences, symposiums and protest rallies in Goteborg, Strasbourg, Paris, Istanbul and in front of the building of European Parliament in Brussels, Guliyeva had comprehensive public speeches on Armenian occupation of Azerbaijani internationally recognized territories. As the result of active socio-political participation, Guliyeva was elected as the president of the \\"Academy of Culture\\" under the World Congress of Azerbaijanis/D√ºnya Az…ôrbaycanlƒ±larƒ± Konqresi in 2004. In 2007, at the headquarters of the Universal Peace Federation in Washington DC, Guliyeva received the status of Goodwill Ambassador. Ilhama Guliyeva receives \\"Yax≈üƒ±larƒ±n Yax≈üƒ±sƒ± / Best of the Bests\\" Award, 2011.  Personal life  Ilhama Guliyeva created a short- term family life with Faig Mirmohsunov in the 1980s. During this very short marriage period, she adopted the surname of her spouse. However, she ended this marriage shortly and returned to her original last name. Moreover, Guliyeva adopted a child ‚Äì Orkhan Nadirov, who is claimed to be a grandson of Guliyeva's aunt.  Guliyeva and contradictory attitudes towards her personality  Ilhama Guliyeva at the TV Show \\"A-dan Z-y…ô\\". ANS TV studio, 2015. Ilhama Guliyeva was a very peculiar musical artist with flamboyant personality. Despite that Guliyeva was respected and loved for her voice and songs, she constantly faced public criticism and dissent towards her personality. Considering the fact that the major segment of Azerbaijani society is conservative with traditional values, this persistent negative attitude towards Guliyeva was due to her liberal behavior with regard to love affairs in the 1980s and 90s. However, nowadays it is an interesting scene to observe when foreign musical artists with no greater decent \\"ethical\\" background visit Azerbaijan, the people rush to highly greet and express their deep respect towards them in concert halls and social media. Considering these vestiges as a temporary phenomenon of a developing society, she never took them seriously, continued to actively participate in musical life of the country and became a leading musical artist of so-called show business in Azerbaijan. =Ilhama Guliyeva vs. Flora Kerimova= Guliyeva was hegemonic, loved glory and honor, as well as demanded respectful attitude from everyone. This made her get into numerous conflicts with many other musical artists of Azerbaijan. Her major disputes were with such Azerbaijani singers as Nazp…ôri Dost…ôliyeva, Elza Seyidcahan, Ayg√ºn Kazƒ±mova and Brilliant Dadashova. Although she had a good and friendly relationship with all her colleagues at the end of her life, the only artist with whom she had not put up since the beginning of her musical career was another People's Artist of Azerbaijan Flora Kerimova. Despite that in 1995, during the joint interview with Kerimova and Guliyeva, they claimed not to be rivals since the genres of music they performed were different, it is not a secret that the issues as \\"who would go on stage to perform first\\" or \\"who would record a song of popular composer before anyone else\\" were ones of the main causes of their enmity. Since Kerimova went on streets against newly elected Azerbaijani government in 2003, she became unwelcomed and later left her active musical career. However, as TV channels were inviting Kerimova to talk shows, she used to insult Guliyeva, naming her a \\"disgrace to the musical stage and art, as well as to the Azerbaijani nation\\".ƒ∞lham…ô Quliyeva s…ôhn…ôy…ô, s…ôn…ôt…ô v…ô mill…ôt…ô l…ôk…ôdir Yet, while Guliyeva in her public and TV speeches held Kerimova in high esteem,ƒ∞lham…ô Quliyeva Flora K…ôrimova haqda danƒ±≈üdƒ± Kerimova's attitude towards Guliyeva didn't change throughout time.

She was hanged from a cottonwood tree in Las Vegas, New Mexico, following a brief and somewhat abnormal legal process. She is the only woman to have been legally executed in New Mexico since its incorporation into the United States. Background and trial Angel was about 19 years old at the time of her death, and belonged to a \\"prominent\\" family in Las Vegas, New Mexico Territory. In March 1861, she was arrested and charged with first-degree murder over the death of her lover, Miguel Martin, who was a married father of five. According to the case put forward by the prosecution, Angel was upset because Martin had told her he was going to end their affair, so she lured him to one final meeting and then stabbed him in the back with a knife she had concealed under her shawl. The presiding judge, Kirby Benedict, instructed the jury to only consider the charge of first- degree murder; they were prohibited from finding her guilty of a non-capital offence (murder of a lesser degree or manslaughter). Angel pled not guilty, on the grounds that her actions were a crime of passion and thus not premeditated. The jury disagreed with that line of reasoning, finding her guilty, and Benedict then sentenced her to death, the only available sentence under territorial law at that time. A short time later, Angel was granted the right to appeal to the New Mexico Supreme Court. However, no concurrent stay of execution was granted, an action which has been criticised as lacking due process by later writers.Armijo (2012), p. 312. Execution Angel was hanged in Las Vegas on the morning of April 26. No gallows were available, so she was instead tied to a cottonwood tree and placed on a wagon attached to a team of horses. Antonio Abad Herrera, the county sheriff and executioner, didn't want to tie her arms, so when the wagon began moving she was able to grab hold of the noose. Herrera attempted to pull her downward, but the crowd prevented him from doing so and cut her free. There was potential for a riot, as some in the crowd believed that she was entitled to be released, but order was maintained and the second attempt was successful.T√≥rrez (2008), p. 133. Legacy The case of Paula Angel received little contemporary attention due to the ongoing American Civil War. Angel was virtually forgotten until 1961, when an article was published in The Santa Fe New Mexican to commemorate the 100th anniversary.T√≥rrez (2008), p. 137. Some sources have described Angel as the only woman to have been legally executed in New Mexico. This is in fact only true of New Mexico as a part of the United States ‚Äì two Puebloan women had been hanged in Santa Fe in 1779, under Spanish colonial rule.Paula Angel: The Only Woman Ever Hanged in New Mexico, New Mexico History. Retrieved 24 November 2017. Until relatively recently, there was no direct evidence that an execution had even been carried out, only folk and oral traditions. Historian Robert T√≥rrez found the original warrant for Angel's execution in the Huntington Library of California, but it initially appeared to contain nothing to suggest the sentence had been carried out.T√≥rrez (2008), p. 139. However, it was subsequently determined that the microfilm of the warrant only included one side. When the original document was examined, Sheriff Herrera's handwritten confirmation of execution was found on the reverse.T√≥rrez (2008), p. 140. Angel's case was featured in an episode of Deadly Women.

Sinclair was one of the key figures in the movement of contemporary artists in Glasgow in the 1990s, dubbed the 'Glasgow Miracle' by art curator and critic Hans-Ulrich Obrist.  Early life and education  Ross Sinclair was born and lived in Bearsden and went to Boclair Academy before studying at the Glasgow School of Art between 1984 and 1992, gaining first a BA in Environmental Art and then a Masters in Fine Art. This study period included an exchange to the California Institute of the Arts, Los Angeles in 1992.  Work  Since the late 80s Sinclair has shown work in hundreds of group and solo exhibitions in the UK and internationally, producing various monographs of his artworks, notably If North Was South and East Was West as well as writing texts and essays in many books and publications. He often makes music in relation to his artworks and this is documented through a number of releases including Ross Sinclair: The Real Life Rock Opera Volume I (2004), Ross and the Realifers: Real Life and How to Live it in Parledonia (2013) and Real Life is Dead/Long Live Real Life (2017.) = Real Life = Ross Sinclair is best known for his Real Life project, initiated in 1994 when he had the words 'Real Life' tattooed across his back. Since then Real Life has become a 23-year performance project, taking form in a wide range of exhibitions, public art and publication contexts. Over the two decades of the Real Life project, Sinclair's work has employed various mediums including performance, painting and music, often at the same time. Through installation and audience participation Real Life has sought to challenge the conventional exhibition practice and connect with the public. These projects have been exhibited worldwide. Throughout the course of the project, a consistent thread of Sinclair's work has sought to address the nature of the individual, collective and national identities of Scotland. During August 2015, Sinclair exhibited his work in 20 Years of Real Life at Edinburgh's Collective Gallery, which celebrated 20 years of his Real Life project. Sinclair worked with teenagers to create 5 bands and produce an LP titled Free Instruments for Teenagers. = Real Life is Dead/Long Live Real Life = The most recent incarnation of the Real Life project came as part of a two-week residency Ross Sinclair undertook at the Shanghai Himalayas Museum in China, ahead of his solo exhibition titled Real Life is Dead/Long Live Real Life. This exhibition served to herald a new phase of Sinclair's on-going Real Life project. For the exhibition Sinclair added the text 'Is Dead' to the 'Real Life' tattoo. The residency focused on the consistent themes of participation, performance and collaboration, coupled with Sinclair's use of music in his art throughout his career. Sinclair worked with students at the Glasgow School of Art over a period of two years to develop and record two songs (Real Life is Dead and Long Live Real Life) which lay at the core of the exhibition. The songs were recorded in both English and Chinese. In Shanghai, Sinclair worked with local musicians, artists and singers to create the Chinese-Scottish Real Life Orchestra - a musical dialogue between the Chinese audience and Sinclair's Real Life Project. The group came together in a collective voice, in English and Chinese, to share experiences through music. The orchestra presented a live performance at the opening reception of the Phase Three exhibition of CURRENT: Contemporary Art from Scotland, which provided the soundtrack to Sinclair's installation consisting of multiple editions of banners and videos representing the 23-years of the Real Life project. Participants were also invited to respond to the themes of Real Life is Dead/Long Live Real Life with words and pictures which were displayed on banners and placards.  Exhibitions  Ross Sinclair has participated in monographic and group exhibitions worldwide. Solo shows include those at the South London Gallery in 2010, Badischer Kunstverein in 2002, Art Metropole, Toronto in 2004 and Angelika Kn√§pper Gallery, Stockholm in 2010. In 2014, Sinclair took part in Generation: 25 Years of Contemporary Art in Scotland at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. In 2016 Sinclair was a Visiting Fellow at St Johns College, Oxford University, where he was Artist in Residence for three months. The residency encourages the artist to contribute to the artistic and cultural life of the college with the possibility to exhibit in the studio and utilise the research and staff of the college and wider university. In 2017 Sinclair exhibited at Inverness Museum and Art Gallery, in a solo-show titled After After After The Monarch of the Glen, Read Life Is Dead. The museum commissioned a response to the iconic Edwin Henry Landseer painting The Monarch of the Glen. Also in 2017, Sinclair undertook a 2-week residency at the Shanghai Himalayas Museum in China. This accumulated in a solo exhibition titled Real Life is Dead/Long Live Real Life. For the exhibition, Sinclair added the text 'is dead' to the ‚Äòreal life‚Äô tattoo. The exhibition included a multi-media presentation. In Shanghai, Sinclair worked with local musicians, artists and singers to create the Chinese-Scottish Real Life Orchestra. The group came together in a collective voice, in English and Chinese, to share experiences through music. The residency was supported by the British Council, and was one of the programmes in the Spirit of Youth campaign in 2017.  Music  Ross Sinclair is a drummer and guitarist. In 1984/85 joined his first band, Gods For All Occasions, featuring Neil Menzies and Raymond McGinlay, later a member of Teenage Fanclub. It was during this time that Sinclair became a founding member of The Soup Dragons. For 5 years he performed on records and played concerts including Glastonbury in 1987, and supported bands such as Primal Scream and The Jesus and Mary Chain. The group went on to perform on Top of the Pops in 1990 and sold half a million albums in the USA. In the early 1990s Sinclair left the group to complete his studies at the Glasgow School of Art. He has previously released records, Real Life Parledonia (2013) and Real Life is Dead/Long Live Real Life (2017) and CD's I Tried to Give Up Drinking With Guitars Instead of God (2013) and The Real Life Rock Opera (2004.)  Writing and PhD  Ross Sinclair has written extensively. He contributed to an essay on Susan Phillipsz (the 2010 Turner Prize winner) and in 2014 to a monograph titled You Are Not Alone. His work appeared in Generation Reader: 25 Years of Contemporary Art in Scotland, which was published in 2014 to mark the exhibition of the same name. In June 2016 Sinclair completed a PhD thesis entitled Ross Sinclair: 20 Years of Real Life and was awarded the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy by Published Work at Glasgow School of Art/Glasgow University.

Career  Cockburn was a researcher in the fields of gender, war and peace-making, labour processes and trade unionism, and refugees. She was active in the international women's peace movement. Cockburn was a visiting professor in the Department of Sociology at City University London and honorary professor in the Centre for the Study of Women and Gender at the University of Warwick. An active antimilitarist, she was involved in a number of peace and anti-war organisations. In 1981, she was part of a group of women who founded Women Against War in the Gulf, and in response to the Bosnian Yugoslav wars, the group evolved to become Women Against War Crime. From 1993, they began calling the group Women in Black in support of other international peace movement efforts, specifically those taking place in Israel, Italy, and Yugoslavia. She was also involved with Women Against Fundamentalism, the European Forum of Socialist Feminists, and was a member of the Women's International League for Peace & Freedom.

Joseph Montfort (c. 1730 - 25 March 1776) was a wealthy North Carolinian land owner and an active Freemason, noted to be the one and only Grand Master of and for American Freemasons. Life We know little about Montfort‚Äôs early life. Although it has been thought that he was born in England this is improbable. We know that he settled in North Carolina in 1752 having migrated from Virginia in his early to mid-twenties, and married Priscilla, a daughter of Colonel Benjamin Hill, a planter and trader. Montfort became a successful merchant and planter and like others of his Rank was active in civic affairs, representing Halifax in the colonial assembly from 1766 to 1774 and eventually serving as a treasurer of the northern part of the colony. Eventually becoming of the wealthiest North Carolinians of the period, Montfort owned more than 30,000 acres scattered in tracts across the province. He was active in freemasonry from the 1760s. and was instrumental in forming the Royal White Hart lodge in Halifax, NC, and in obtaining a second warrant for the lodge from the Grand Lodge of England under the hand of Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort (1744-1803), Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of England 1767-72, which Montfort presented to the lodge on his return to Halifax in May 1768. Following the death of Benjamin Smith (1715-1770), Provincial Grand Master for North and South Carolina, Beaufort issued a deputation to Montfort appointing him ‚ÄòProvincial Grand Master of and for America‚Äô, although the relevant Grand Lodge Minutes are phrased Provincial G. M. for North Carolina‚Äô. The deputation is dated 14 January 1771. Montfort‚Äôs gravestone at the Royal White Hart Lodge in Halifax reads ‚ÄòThe highest masonic official ever reigning on this continent‚Ä¶the first, the last, the only Grand Master of America‚Äô. Montfort visited England in the winter of 1767 with a fellow North Carolinian planter, Alexander McCulloh, and it is during this time in London that he would have sat for Nathaniel Dance-Holland to have his portrait executed, see Portrait on this page. Montfort was known for his extravagance in matters masonic and for purchasing expensive lodge furniture, glassware and porcelain, as well as for acquiring paintings, sculptures and other furnishings for himself to send back to North Carolina. Montfort‚Äôs journey to London would not only provided the opportunity to obtain a new and more prestigious lodge warrant from the Grand Lodge of England, but also to advance his case as Provincial Grand Master. Joseph Montfort was a delegate to the Second North Carolina Provincial Congress from the town of Halifax, North Carolina. Montfort died from pulmonary problems in 1776.

Life  Catherine Ray was born and raised in Suffolk. Her father died when she was three, and she was repeatedly ill in childhood. Following the death of her mother, whom Catherine nursed in her final illness, she began a twenty five year period of frequent travel, visiting Scandinavia, Russia, continental Europe and Australia. She lectured in both English and Italian, and in the mid-1870s was involved in the Association for the University Education of Women while resident in Edinburgh. She became committed to the promotion of women's civil and political rights, of temperance, and the Charity Organisation Society. She was also an active member of the Primrose League during her time living in Hampstead around 1890. To an interviewer in 1890 she said of herself and her beliefs: > \\"You may think me a strange compound. I am a staunch Conservative, an > upholder of the Reformed Church of England, a consistent teetotaller, and a > Socialist in so far as I believe that love and sympathy with the sufferings > of our poorer brethren should determine the actions of all; true progress > for them and us lies in helping them to help themselves; in so far as this > is Socialism, I am a Socialist. I am loyal to the backbone, and my hope lies > in the womanhood of the world!\\" Her date of death is not known.  Writing  Catherine Ray began her literary career with a translation of Henrik Ibsen's play Emperor and Galilean (1873). Ray's translation appeared in 1876, and was the earliest published English translation of one of Ibsen's plays. As Katherine Newey notes, Ray's introduction to her translation \\"constitutes the earliest English-language analysis of Ibsen's theatre\\". Although Ray herself asserted that it had '\\"received very favourable press notices\\", one of Ray's contemporaries commented on the subsequent neglect shown to her pioneering work: > \\"I have not noticed that any of the critics have mentioned the fact that > Miss Ray was the first to introduce Ibsen to the English public. I am afraid > she found that her efforts were not appreciated.\\" Ray followed up her translation with a series of novels, including a work for children set in Norway, a 'temperance novel' set largely in Edinburgh, and a further book set in the Tyrol. Of this, her final novel, a reviewer in The County Gentleman commented: > \\"The author of 'A New Exodus' shows a strong feeling for Nature as she > reveals herself in the glorious mountains and fair valleys of beautiful > Tyrol. The odour of heath and pine seems to stir these pages like a living > breath, and the magnificent panorama of the Alpine scenery forms a fitting > framework for a picture of noble constancy and endurance.\\" Writing in The Academy, William Wallace acknowledged: > \\"Altogether 'The Exiles of the Zillerthal', unambitious as it is, and > suggestive, as regards its author, of literary power in reserve, may, > without exaggeration, be described as a model story of its class.\\"  Works  * \\"Catalan Bay: A Story of Gibraltar\\", The Monthly Packet, 1872 * Henrik Ibsen, The Emperor and the Galilean, trans.

The WindSled or Inuit WindSled is a project that has as central axis a wind vehicle, unique in the world, to travel and transport equipment through polar lands, and which has been designed by the Spanish polar explorer, Ram√≥n Hernando de Larramendi. The vehicle is based on Inuit tradition, which Larramendi has combined with large kites so that it may progress through the interior of the Arctic and Antarctic plateau, driven by aeolian energy. It is able to transport up to of weight. As of 2017, the vehicle has successfully covered more than , driven only by the wind, reaching the Geographic South Pole, the South Pole of Inaccessibility and the highest altitude in the interior of Greenland. The Inuit WindSled has been improving for the last 18 years, during which it has served as a scientific platform for projects of different Spanish and international scientific institutions.EGRIP Field Season 2017 Its purpose is to develop scientific and geographic exploration projects with zero emissions in polar regions.  Layout  The Inuit WindSled is composed of four articulated modules, each of them made up with wooden rails and crossbars between in length and in width. This is the so-called 'Larramendi platform', the name of its designer. These rails and crossbars are joined by about 2,000 knots with high resistance ropes, which gives flexibility to adapt to irregularities in the terrain. In the lower part, it has Teflon platforms to facilitate sliding. The first of the modules has a piloting tent where the kite controls are located, but it also has a work space. Next, two modules are attached for the load, and that's where all the equipment goes. The last module has another larger tent for crew rest. With this configuration, it can be divided into two vehicles when terrain and conditions require it. The WindSled works with kites of different sizes, the largest of , depending on wind conditions. Under normal conditions, its perfect average speed is about , although it has reached over in some moments. It is equipped with photovoltaic panels for the electrical supply of the scientific and communications equipment it carries on board and all the composing parts can be repaired without the need of external assistance.  History and evolution  After traveling more than through the Arctic, during the Circumpolar Expedition, Ram√≥n H. de Larramendi learned the construction and handling of Inuit sleds and observed the force of the winds in polar territories. It was the germination of the WindSled project. At the beginning of year 2000, he designed the first models of the vehicle and after performing several tests with fiberglass and wood, he found that the latter, following the Inuit tradition, was much more effective than more modern materials. That same year, he made a first crossing in Greenland of with an incipient design that consisted of a single module with a tent on top. Despite the difficulties, it was a success. Since then the vehicle, which has been called \\"polar butterfly\\", \\"polar catamaran\\" and finally Inuit WindSled, has accomplished a total of six expeditions in Greenland and two in Antarctica, with a total distance covered of , and all of them finalizing successfully. The first crossings in Greenland, in the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, strengthened the possibilities of the mobile platform on the polar terrain. It would obtain the '2001 Trip of the Year' Award from the Spanish Geographical Society. Right after the 2005-2006 Transantarctic Expedition, the expedition decided to use the vehicle for polar scientific exploration, once possibilities of navigating with a heavy load were proven. In addition to serving for geographic exploration, scientific data could be collected on the crossings. With that objective, in 2012, after the Acciona Antarctica Expedition, a prototype of two modules was presented to the Spanish polar scientific community at the Autonomous University of Madrid. It was also presented to the scientific community in Great Britain. During the 2014 and 2016 expeditions in Greenland, the WindSled designer developed new technical possibilities in two Arctic expeditions, increasing its dimensions. In 2014, the vehicle made the circumnavigation of Greenland by ice, a route of with a prototype of three modules in which four people traveled. In 2016, with the Greenland Ice Summit expedition, it became a convoy of four modules, with a total length of , a maximum of six people on board in a journey to attain the level in altitude with two tons of weight. They covered . It was confirmed that, even in extreme conditions, the WindSled was a sustainable and efficient means of transport. The last expedition, 2017 Greenland Ice River, took place in the spring of that year, with five crew on board. It took 28 days to cover and different international scientific projects related to climate change were developed in collaboration with the East Greenland Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) scientific base at NEGIS, the Dark Snow Project and other relevant scientific institutions.  Scientific research  In parallel to these external improvements, the interest of polar scientists has increased. Among the most relevant, the American glaciologist Jason Box, Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), and the Spaniards, Antonio Quesada, Autonomous University of Madrid and Spanish Polar Program manager, Ignacio L√≥pez Moreno, Pyrenean Institute of Ecology (CSIC) and Juan Jos√© Blanco, University of Alcal√°. With this vehicle drilling has been carried out in the interior of Greenland down to , collected data on the state of snow, air samples and data concerning cosmic rays. In 2016, the first scientific results of samples taken on the WindSled Acciona Antarctica expedition were published. An investigation, published in November in the scientific journal Atmospheric Environment, revealed the existence of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), from pesticides, in the interior of Antarctica. The main researchers were Jordi Dachs and Ana Cabrerizo, Institute of Environmental Diagnosis and Water Studies (IDAEA-CSIC). In 2017, polar researcher Ross Edwards, with the international Dark Snow Project,Dark Snow Project participated as part of the expedition crew in Greenland, collecting data for the project.

Walter Clarke moved into the District circa 1798 where he became a prominent businessman who served the District of Columbia as an Alderman and later on the Board of Appeals.National Intelligencer Washington DC 21 August 1813,p.3.Washington Gazette 7 June 1819, p.1 Walter Clarke was a slaveholder in his own right purchasing and utilizing slaves both for his business and household.Rogers Helen Hoban Freedom & Slavey Documents in the District of Columbia Vol. 2 1806 -1816 (Gateway Press:Baltimore MD 2008),143n189.1840 United States Federal Census Washington, Washington District of Columbia. Clarke quickly moved to set aside the provisions of John Thompson's will. As administrator Clarke held Joe, Nell, and their daughter Sarah Ann as slaves after 1808. Clarke also appeared as a juror in an early and highly significant petition for freedom case, Ben v. Sabret Scott (1807). About 1808 Clarke leased Joe Thompson to the Washington Navy Yard, where Thompson worked as a blacksmith striker for many years. For the first thirty years of the nineteenth century, the Navy Yard was the District's principal employer of enslaved African Americans. Their numbers rose rapidly and by 1808, the enslaved made up one third of the workforce. During this era the navy yard was \\"a favorite place to rent out slaves,\\" and to sell them; but quickly became a recognized center of resistance.Pacheco, Josephine E.

This document written to answer a query from the Secretary of the Navy, provides the names of slave and slaveholders. Typically to get their bondsmen on the navy payroll; some owners dealt directly with the master mechanics, especially those in the blacksmith shop, while others bargained with the Commandant or the Secretary of the Navy.Martin Jonathan D. Divided Mastery: Slave Hiring in the American South (Boston: Harvard University Press 2004) ,6-8.

The third cousin, once removed of Sir Walter Scott, she was born into an old Scottish family. Little is known about her early life, but during her travels to the Antigua, St. Christopher, North Carolina, and Portugal in 1774‚Äì1776, she kept a journal, \\"blessedly unaware that as she jotted down her opinions and descriptions that she was a writing for posterity a document of rare interest and importance, now which as far as we know, and especially as it bears on the Scottish phase of American colonial history, is unique\\". After her return to Britain she lived in Edinburgh and Plymouth, where she met King George III and Queen Charlotte. Janet died in 1800.  Early life  Little is known of Janet's early life, since the place and date of her birth are unclear, although she probably spent many years at Lauriston Yards, a fourteen-acre farm just outside Edinburgh, and had at least two brothers. The elder brother, Robert, was lost to Janet from childhood when he travelled at a young age to the American colonies, and the younger, Alexander (known as Sandie), accompanied her on her eventual voyage to those colonies. Their parents, Gideon Schaw of Lauriston, the Register of Tobacco in Edinburgh, and Anne Rutherfurd of Bowland, married in Edinburgh in 1723. However, upon Gideon's death in 1772, his affairs were such that Alexander had to sell the Lauriston estate.Caledonian Mercury 7 September 1772 Janet would have lived in Edinburgh at the time of the Edinburgh Enlightenment. When the ship in which she was travelling to the West Indies broached at sea, she calmed one of the children, Fanny, by getting her to read the nearest book, which she later realised was Elements of Criticism by Lord Kames.  Travels to the West Indies and US  In 1774‚Äì1776, she sailed from Burntisland in Fife board The Jamaica Packet to St. Kitts and Antigua, in the West Indies, then to North and South Carolina, returning to Edinburgh via Portugal in 1776. She kept a journal of her travels which was discovered in the British Library in 1904 and published as Journal of a Lady of Quality Being the Narrative of a Journey from Scotland to the West Indies, North Carolina and Portugal in the Years 1774 -1776. On her travels she would experience storms at sea off Fair Isle, compare the slave-laboured sugar plantations to the improving East Lothian farms, witness the onset of the American Revolution in Cape Fear, and its effects on her family and friends, and marvel at the Christmas pageantry and processions in Portugal. On her journeys she was accompanied by her brother Alexander Schaw, three adolescents, Fanny (18) John (11) and William (Billie) Rutherfurd (9), as well as Mrs. Mary Miller, her abigail, and a manservant, Robert. The three youngsters were the children of John Rutherfurd of Bowland, Midlothian (the Edgerston branch of the Rutherfurds)Journal of a Lady of Quality, p 340 who was a plantation owner and former Customs official living in Wilmington. The children were returning to their father. Alexander was due to take up an appointment as Customs Officer on St. Kitts. Janet also visited her other brother Robert at his plantation, Schawfield, located a few miles from Wilmington on the Cape Fear River. The Rutherfurd children had recently inherited a plantation. On her journey, Janet would meet prominent West Indian families and Scots.  The Effect of the American Revolution  Janet had planned to remain in North Carolina with Fanny, but the American revolution frustrated these plans. Her brother would not take up his post in St. Kitts. Instead he went off 'quietly on board the Scorpion Man of War to BostonLetter from John Rutherford to Major General John Scott, MP 11 Aug 1775 - Loyalist Claims Papers at The National Archives - quoted on p334 of Journal of a Lady of Quality' and then to London, carrying despatches from Governor Josiah Martin of North Carolina to Lord Dartmouth informing him of the situation in North Carolina. Janet returned to Edinburgh via Portugal with Fanny, John and Billie. The boys were sent to England to be educated under the care of Lord Townshend. Fanny married Archbald Menzies shortly after their arrival home in October 1776.  Later life  Janet returned to Edinburgh, living in the New Town. Fanny's husband would die and on 30 April 1787 at St. Martins-in the Field, London, Fanny married Janet's brother, Alexander Schaw.England Marriages 1538-1973, accessed at www.findmypast.co.uk on 24 November 2017 made available by FamilySearch Into Alexander Schaw was appointed as Storekeeper at the Gun Wharf in the Royal Dockyards at Plymouth Dock. Janet lived with Alexander and Fanny in the Officer's barracks there. In 1789 George III and Queen Charlotte visited the Royal Dockyards to review the Fleet and the Dockyards. On Monday 17 August, they visited the Dockyard where they were met 'by a great number of naval and military officers.\\" According to Mrs W.H. Nelson, a descendant of the Rutherfurds, the King and Queen, \\"had lunch with Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Schaw and Miss Janet Schaw. There was a good view of the shipping to be had from their balcony and when, after lunch, Queen Charlotte, went out to look at it, Miss Janet Schaw spread a very beautiful shawl over the balcony railing for the queen to lean on. Afterward this shawl was put away as a relic and eventually went to New Zealand with members of the Schaw family who settled there.\\"Journal of a Lady of Quality - p 343 Janet wrote her will on 14 March 1792The National Archives PROB 11/1355/144 describing herself as a spinster. She left all her assets in Scotland and England to her 'dear Brother Alexander Schaw Esquire now of His Majesty's Ordinance at Plymouth Dock.' She may have been worried about her health when she wrote her will as the Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette records a Mr and Miss Schaw arriving in Bath in its 29 March 1792 issue. Prior to her death, Janet, Alexander and Fanny subscribed to a book, Alonzo and Cora, with other original poems, principally elegiac by Elizabeth Scot, a native of Edinburgh to which are added letters in verse by Blacklock and Burns. The book would not be published until after Janet's death in 1800. Janet was buried on 21 December 21, 1800 in Eggbuckland, in Plymouth, Devon.Plymouth and West Devon Record Office, Devon Burials 1169/1 accessed at www.findmypast  Journal of a Lady of Quality  The Journal records Janet's travels during 1774 - 1776 in a series of letters. In her first letter of 9pm October 25, 1774 she says \\"I propose writing every day, but you must not expect a regular journal. I will not fail to write whatever can amuse myself and whether you find it entertaining or not, I know you will refuse it a reading. As every subject will be guided by my own immediate feelings my opinions and descriptions will depend on the health and humour of the moment in which I write; from which cause my sentiments will often appear to differ on the same subject.'Journal of a Lady of Quality - p6  Identifying the Author of a Lady of Quality  The journal was first discovered in 1904 during a search for other material in the British Library, where it was catalogued as Egerton 2423. The manuscript had no name on it and it was \\"only after much following of clues and searching in the records of England, Scotland, Ireland, the West Indies and America [that] the editors [have] been able to trace the careers of those who play the leading parts in the story.' A further two copies of the manuscript have since been found. One, owned by the Antiguan historian, Mr. Vere Langford Oliver, contained a dedication to Alexander Schaw Esquire \\"the Brother, friend and fellow traveler of the Author, his truly affect. Jen. Schaw, St. Andrew's Square, March 10, 1778.\\" This helped to identify the author. The third manuscript had been passed down through the Schaw family and was owned by Colonel Vetch, a descendant of Janet's grandfather. Vetch was able to provide further genealogical information which appeared as a family tree in the 1939 edition. The North Carolina Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill holds a contemporary manuscript copy.  Reviews and Academic Comment on Journal of a Lady of Quality  The journal has been reviewed in a number of academic books as it contains a personal account of Colonial America and Empire on the brink of the American Revolution. 'The journal is eminently readable, at times gripping, with a distinctive narrative voice' and 'is an especially instructive example of the way aesthetics lent itself to knitting together categories of social denomination.' The journal is clearly 'a private document' and takes the form of a letter. But who it was written for is a point of conjecture. Janet's statement that \\"At whatever time we meet, I am certain we will meet with unabated regards'Journal of a Lady of Quality - p130 has led to conjecture that it was written to someone who was \\"much more like a lover left behind than a friend.' 'We should celebrate Schaw's ability to bring that world to life, her incisiveness in noting the rituals and drama and details of the societies she encountered, and her relating even those things that she could not 'see' so clearly from her vantage point.

Her modifications to the Beechcraft Duke were used to improve the aircraft. Over the course of her career, Reilly logged over 10,000 flight hours as a pilot-in-command ‚Äî without a single accident. She is a member of the Canadian Aviation Hall of Fame.  Early life  An aerial view of Lindsay, Ontario, c. 1919 Reilly was born February 25, 1922, in Lindsay, Ontario. She had seven siblings, three sisters and four brothers, at least one brother enlisted as a pilot during WWII.  Career  = World War II = After graduating from high school in 1940, Reilly took flying lessons at Pat Paterson's Flyers Limited School at Barker Field. One of her teachers was fellow Canadian aviator Violet Milstead. Reilly's flight training was cut short when WWII forced civilian aviators to stay grounded, so she applied to join the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in order to complete her pilot certification, but was rejected due to her gender. Although the Air Transport Auxiliary accepted women, Reilly couldn't join without her pilot's license. Determined to find a job that involved flying, in 1941 she finally enlisted with the RCAF as a photographer in the new Women's Division. She continued working as a non-commissioned officer for the RCAF until 1946. = Post-war era = In 1946, after the war ended, Reilly was finally able to finish her flight lessons, earning her private pilot's license from what would later become the Rockcliffe Flying Club in Ottawa. By 1947, she had earned her commercial flight license. That same year, Reilly gained national media attention when she participated in the 1947 Webster Trophy aviation race. She was awarded the Sanderson Shield for placing as runner-up, finishing barely three-tenths of a point behind the first place winner. After completing her instructor's certification, Reilly was hired as a flight instructor at the Leavens Brothers Flying School in Toronto. During her employment at the school, she continued to upgrade her aviation skills, earning multi-engine and instrument ratings at the Spartan School of Aeronautics before completing her seaplane pilot qualifications at Port Alberni. In 1953, Reilly travelled to England to earn a senior commercial license, a public transport license, and her air transport ratings. A year later, she was hired as the chief flying instructor and charter pilot for Canadian Aircraft Renters. In 1957, she was promoted as full-time charter pilot for the company, transferred to its subsidiary Southern Provincial Airlines, becoming the first Canadian female pilot to reach the rank of captain. During her work at Southern Provincial Airlines, Reilly became the first woman to fly professionally to the Arctic, and assisted in the development of the company's air ambulance service in Eastern Canada. A Beechcraft Duke aircraft Taking a new job with the Calgary company Peter Bawden Drilling in 1959, Reilly co-piloted a DC-3 airliner. She flew extensively throughout the north, piloting back and forth between major oil airfields and making runs to places such as Frobisher Bay and Resolute Bay. Reilly often dealt with extreme weather conditions, poor visibility, and few navigational aids. In 1965, Reilly joined Canadian Coachways (later Canadian Utilities) and was hired as their chief pilot, becoming the first female corporate pilot in Canada.

Pura Dalem Sakenan is dedicated to [rambut sedhana] and is associated with prosperity. Pura Dalem Sakenan is the focus temple of the 210-day Piodalan festival where in the past processions of pilgrims visited the island on foot or by traditional colorful wooden boats called jukung. With the construction of the bridge connecting the Serangan island with Bali as well as the reclamation of the island, the use of colorful jukung for pilgrimage has died out. History Pura Sakenan in early 20th-century before reclamation. Pura Dalem Sakenan was established in the 10th century by high priest Mpu Kuturan, a notable priest said to arrive in Bali in 1001 AD before the fall of the Majapahit Kingdom. Mpu Kuturan was instrumental in the introduction and the establishment of Balinese Hinduism in the island. As a center of pilgrimage, the temple has undergone several renovations except for its antique perimeter walls. In 1982, the surrounding villagers expanded the western part of Pura Dalem Sakenan temple complex. During the renovation, the older temple which was built of limestone and corals from the surrounding coastal reefs was carefully preserved. In 1996, Serangan Island was reclaimed and a new bridge was constructed, connecting the island of Serangan with the main island of Bali. Reclamation of the Serangan Island was decided to improve the development of the island. Before the addition of bridges, the island of Serangan was often neglected in development. At the time before the reclamation of the island, children of Serangan had to use the traditional wooden boats to access the main island to attend schools. Temple compound Pura Dalem Sakenan is a Pura Dalem, a type of pura which is dedicated to the worship of Shiva. Pura Dalem temple is associated with rituals concerning death. Among the elements which feature a Pura Dalem is a large tree or a kepuh, which is also used as a shrine. Like all pura, Pura Dalem Sakenan consists of three areas: the outer sanctum of the temple (jaba pisan or nistaning mandala), the middle sanctum (jaba tengah or madya mandala), and the inner main sanctum (jero or utamaning mandala). The outer sanctum or jaba pisan is the outermost courtyard of the temple. The outer sanctum of Pura Dalem Sakenan consists of empty courtyard. Two large trees adorned with pol√®ng cloth, a black and white checkered pattern cloth. The trees are considered as dwellings for the guardian spirits of the temple complex. The middle sanctum or jaba tengah is surrounded with the perimeter wall. A candi bentar gate marks the entrance to this area to the west. The inner sanctum or jero is the most sacred part of a Balinese temple. There are numbers of pelinggih shrines and other types of shrines, each dedicated to the local deities. The tallest pelinggih is dedicated to Jro Dukuh Sakti. A paduraksa gate marks the entrance into the jero. Festivals Pura Dalem Sakenan is the main focus of the annual Piodalan festival, a celebration of the temple's anniversary. The Piodalan is held once every 210 days (the number of days in one Balinese year) on every Kliwon Kuningan Saturday. The Kuningan is the last day of the Galungan celebrations. During the Piodalan, people from the surrounding area would cross the sea to visit the small island of Serangan. At low tide, people would walk toward the Serangan carrying ancient heirlooms and sacred temple objects, through the mangrove forest separating the main island of Bali with Serangan. During high tide, traditional colorful wooden outriggers called jukung carry the crowds into the island. In 1996 reclamations took place on the island of Serangan. Today the island has been connected with the Serangan Sakenan bridge to the main island. Upon arrival, the pilgrims would proceed towards the Pura Susunan Wadon, another temple located around half a kilometer to the east. The second temple to be visited by the pilgrims is the Pura Susunan Agung. The last temple to be visited by the pilgrims is the Pura Dalem Sakenan.

The last book ‚Äì ‚ÄòThe Name of the Thief‚Äô (2015) ‚Äì has become a whole new stage in the creative activity of Ramiz Abbasli. The hero of this novel is not a man, but a historical truth. Not everyone likes the truth. Therefore, they trampled it in the mud; even they want to destroy it. In the novel ‚ÄòThe Name of the Thief‚Äô a severely wounded historical truth, bloodied, but still alive, leaning on the writer's hand, rises and speaks for itself; it is an accusatory speech in the historical court.The magazine \\"Azerbaijan\\" 2005, No. 6 ‚ÄúThe book ‚ÄòThe name of the thief‚Äô of the writer Ramiz Abbasli presents to the readers in an artistic way the anatomy of turning of Armenians into the thief of the historical names who have seized our ancient territories in the Caucasus, our material and spiritual wealth by the thousands of deception, fraud and betrayal with the help of their powerful protector\\"the newspaper \\"Xalq q…ôzeti\\" writes from April 9, 2015. ‚ÄúIn the book ‚ÄòThe name of the thief‚Äô Ramiz Abbasli introduce the sworn enemy who had repeatedly hit his nation from behind.

Under the patronage of the Russian Tsars and then the Bolshevik leadership, Armenians had been moved to the Western Azerbaijan and Karabakh territories from the foreign countries. Armenians who set on their feet managed to establish a state for the first time in history, gained all kinds of support from their foreign backers.

A number of quotes can be increased, but there is no need for it in a little article. These three citations include the relocation of Armenians to Azerbaijan, the establishment a state for them in Azerbaijan, the disaster of the Azerbaijani people due to this event and the reflection of this tragedy in the novel \\"The name of the thief\\". The Azerbaijani people welcomed this work with love. The authors consider that this beautiful work is understandable, every Azerbaijani should read it, this book can even be used as a textbook in the universities and colleges. ‚Äì This is a very high appreciation. Every good art work is first of all national. \\"The name of the thief\\" is also national. This work is written for the Azerbaijani people. The people also like it. None of any other nation has suffered the disaster which Azerbaijani people did. None of other nation's babies have been burned to death by their parents‚Äô eyes. None nation's pregnant brides have not been torn their bellies with the bayonets and pushed the infants muddling them with the soil. This Armenian bestiality was so widespread that it was brought forward for discussion in the Russian State Duma early in the twentieth century. During the First World War, Armenians killed the ten thousands of Azerbaijani children with extreme brutality. Therefore, there is no such work in the literature of any other nation. Such a work could be written by an Azerbaijani who feels in his bones the tragedy of his nation and can experience it.  Translations  Translation of fiction takes a special place in the creative life of Ramiz Abbasli. His translations have appeared since the 90s. He translated the stories of Joyce, A. Koppard, K. Mansfield, Galsworthy, Kafka, Hemingway, S. Anderson, J. Steinbeck, H. Bell, I. Bachmann, J. Updike, D. K. Oates, the poems of Yeats, Rothko, Snyder, the plays of Y. Yelinek, G. Pinter, the novels of W. Golding, C. Dickens‚Ä¶The newspaper \\"Azerbaijani teacher\\", August 8, 2015 A false method of translating fiction was formed in Azerbaijan in Soviet period. Mostly they did the translations not from the original, but from Russian.

It was founded in 1925 with the subtitle \\"Weekly Magazine of Letters, Sciences and Arts\\" and was published until 1977. History La Fiera Letteraria had over fifty years of publications history, numerous changes of directors and publisher while still maintaining the weekly frequency. Over the course of its existence, publishers and printers were more than twenty. The magazine was founded in Milan on 13 December 1925 under the directorship of Umberto Fracchia. It was inspired by the name and methods of Frusta letteraria, the magazine founded in Venice by Giuseppe Baretti in 1763. The folio was six or eight pages, the standard for the era. From 12 of 1928 the seat was transferred to Rome under the direction of Giovanni Battista Angioletti and Curzio Malaparte. From April 1929 the magazine took the name of La Fiera Letteraria Italia (The Literary Fair was retained as a subtitle for the rest of the year), continuing to exist until 1936, when the publications ceased for the first time. Subsequently, Curzio Malaparte founded the Meridiano di Roma (rivista), which continued its weekly publications until 1943. In 1946, the magazine resumed the publications with the original title of La Fiera Letteraria, still under the directorship of Angioletti and with an editing team made up by Corrado Alvaro, Emilio Cecchi, Gianfranco Contini and Giuseppe Ungaretti. In the postwar period, the magazine resumed the debate of the first series focusing on themes and issues of cultural and literary character. In 1966 the magazine adopted the tabloid format to highlight its modernization process. La Fiera Letteraria suspended activities for two years, from 1969 to 1970 and resumed in 1971 but due to economic difficulties and funding, ended in 1977.
