Transition metal nitrile complexes are coordination compounds containing nitrile ligands. Because nitriles are weakly basic, the nitrile ligands in these complexes are often labile. Scope of nitriles Typical nitrile ligands are acetonitrile, propionitrile, and benzonitrile. The structures of [Ru(NH3)5(NCPh)]n+ have been determined for the 2+ and 3+ oxidation states. Upon oxidation the Ru-NH3 distances contract and the Ru-NCPh distances elongate, consistent with amines serving as pure-sigma donor ligands and nitriles functioning as pi-acceptors. Structural comparisons of [Ru(NH3)5(NCPh)]n+ for 2+ and 3+ salts (distance in picometers) Synthesis and reactions Acetonitrile, propionitrile and benzonitrile are also popular solvents. Because nitrile solvents have high dielectric constants, cationic complexes containing a nitrile ligand are often soluble in a solution of that nitrile. Some complexes can be prepared by dissolving an anhydrous metal salt in the nitrile. In other cases, a suspension of the metal is oxidized with a solution of NOBF4 in the nitrile: :Ni + 6 MeCN + 2 NOBF4 ‚Üí [Ni(MeCN)6](BF4)2 + 2 NO Heteroleptic complexes of molybdenum and tungsten can by synthesized from their respective hexacarbonyl complexes. :M(CO)6 + 4 MeCN + 2 NOBF4 ‚Üí [M(NO)2(MeCN)4](BF4)2 Portion of the structure of the tetrachlorozincate (ZnCl42‚àí) salt of [Ni(MeCN)6]2+ For the synthesis of some acetonitrile complexes, the nitrile serves as a reductant. This method is illustrated by the conversion of molybdenum pentachloride to the molybdenum(IV) complex: : 2 MoCl5 + 5 CH3CN ‚Üí 2 MoCl4(CH3CN)2 + ClCH2CN + HCl Reactions Transition metal nitrile complexes are usually employed because the nitrile ligand is labile and relatively chemically inert. Cationic nitrile complexes are however susceptible to nucleophilic attack at carbon. Consequently some nitrile complexes catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to give the amides. Fe- and Co- nitrile complexes are intermediates in nitrile hydratase enzymes. N-coordination activates the sp-hybridized carbon center toward attack by nucleophiles, including water. Thus coordination of the nitrile to a cationic metal center is the basis for the catalytic hydration: :M-NCR + H2O ‚Üí M-O=C(NH2)R :M-O=C(NH2)R + NCR ‚Üí O=C(NH2)R + M-NCR Examples * Tetrakis(acetonitrile)copper(I) hexafluorophosphate ([Cu(MeCN)4]PF6), a colorless solid that serves as a source of naked \\"Cu+\\" * Bis(benzonitrile)palladium dichloride (PdCl2(PhCN)2), an orange solid that serves as a source of \\"PdCl2\\" * Hexakis(acetonitrile)nickel(II) tetrafluoroborate ([Ni(MeCN)6](BF4)2), a blue solid that is a source of naked \\"Ni2+\\" * Dimolybdenum deca- and octakis(acetonitrile) tetrafluoroborate ([Mo2(MeCN)8/10](BF4)4), a source of \\"naked\\" Mo24+.

He is best known for having designed many luxury houses, grand public buildings, and business buildings, as well as hotels and churches. Backer was very productive and was one of the leading architects in Norway in the decades around 1900. His son Lars Backer was later one of Norway's leading functionalist architects. Backer was educated at Wilhelm von Hanno's drawing school, at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry in Christiania, and in Dresden. When he returned to Norway from abroad, he first worked for three years as a stipendiary building inspector in Christiania before he established his own practice in the town in 1882. Selected works One of the first large commissions that Backer accepted was to design a mansion for the lumber merchant and government minister Hans Rasmus Astrup. The Minister Astrup Mansion () stands at Drammensveien no. 78 in Oslo and was built in 1887 as a private home for Astrup and his family. In 1911 the building was taken over by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, which still owns the building today. Around the same time he designed the Fridheim Mansion () on the shore of Kr√∏deren for the lumber merchant Svend Haug from Drammen. The building was intended to serve as a country home for the lumber merchant and his family. Later it was used as a hotel, and since 1986 the Fridheim Mansion Adventure Museum has been located there. Backer designed another mansion at the Skaugum estate. It was commissioned by Fritz Wedel Jarlsberg and was built in 1891 in a style similar to that of the Fridheim Mansion. The Skaugum estate was presented to Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess M√§rtha, who moved into it in 1929. The mansion was destroyed by fire on May 20, 1930. Ibsen Museum Backer also designed the Olympen Restaurant at Gr√∏nlandsleiret no. 15 in Oslo, built in 1882. The building was commissioned by the Schou Brewery and was built of brick with plaster ornamentation. The building was remodeled by his son Lars Backer in 1927. A restaurant has operated in the building since it was opened in 1892. In the mid-1890s, Backer designed the building at Arbins gate no. 1 in Oslo. This is the house where Henrik Ibsen lived during his last years, and the building now contains the Olso Ibsen Museum. Backer's Backerg√•rden building is a Baroque Revival structure at Kongens gate no. 31 in Oslo. It was built for the businessman Johan Paul J√∏rgen Alexander Backer and his fur business in 1895. The building was built with a steel supporting skeleton structure that allows the large windows. The facade is clad with Norwegian marble from the Dunderland Valley in the municipality of Rana. Other works by Backer include Saint John's Church in Bergen, Klemetsrud Church, Sollih√∏gda Chapel, Stensg√•rd Church, Krebseg√•rden at Holtegata no. 20 in Oslo, the Victoria Hotel in Lillehammer, Simersg√•rden at Grev Wedels plass no. 4 in Oslo, the Alfheim Complex at Pilestredet no. 27 in Oslo, the dormitory building at J√∏nsberg Upper Secondary School in Romedal, and an addition to the Madserud estate at Madserud all√© no 34 in Oslo.

She began her career in drawing and engraving and later incorporated other artistic languages, such as photography, installation, and performance. Her work was marked by themes of politics and protest. She was an active participant in the . She received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1994 and was granted the Figari Award in 2006 for her artistic career. Biography Childhood Nelbia Romero was born on 8 December 1938 in the town of Durazno, Uruguay. She was the eldest daughter of a family of rural landowners. Her parents, Apolinaria Cabrera and Conrado Romero, settled in the city for her birth, where later the youngest daughter of the marriage and her only sister, Mar√≠a Teresa, was born. Romero's upbringing alternated between the city and the countryside, where she spent her vacations. Her father, a landowner and local political figure, socially active and atheist, shared with his eldest daughter an interest in music and history, passing along his concern for social justice. Training Romero completed elementary school and secondary studies at the school of the Immaculate Conception of Durazno. She left without finishing her preparatory architecture studies in 1959 to enter the Durazno Workshop of Plastic Arts. Claudio Silveira Silva, her teacher for two years, strongly influenced her vocation and encouraged her to move to Montevideo to continue her studies at the (ENBA). Supported by her father, she moved to the country's capital in 1962, abandoning marriage plans. At the ENBA she received multiple artistic and political influences. The painter Mario Pareja guided her to the graphic arts, suggesting that she enter the printing workshop. In 1967 her father died and she stopped attending the Institute. In 1968 Romero entered the school of the Engraving Club, where she was a student of and met her former ENBA classmate, Rimer Cardillo. She also participated in the graphic activity of the Club: monthly newsletters, almanacs, and illustrations. In this time she experimented with different materials and studied the history of art at the Faculty of Humanities. She also received training as an educator of plastic expression, which allowed her to later work as a teacher in primary schools and workshops for adults. Political activity Romero was a politically engaged artist who supported causes and social movements through her artistic activity. In 1969 she joined the Communist Party, where she would continue to work until the 1990s. Artistic production Early works During the first phase of Romero's career she was mainly engaged in drawing and engraving. Between 1975 and 1980 she participated in \\"El Dibujazo\\", a movement in which draughtsmen and graphic artists took part in expressing themselves against the social conflict of the period of the dictatorship. At this stage she began to show her work in collective exhibitions, and in 1976 she held her first individual exhibition, received some prizes, and sent works abroad. During that year, she collaborated with draftswomen Beatriz Battoine, Irene Ferrando, and Marta Restuccia, and experimented by complementing her samples with audiovisual recordings with Nelson Advalov, which would lead her to new multimedia aesthetic searches in the 1980s. In fact, at the end of the decade, in 1988, she retired from the Engraving Club after promoting an unsuccessful attempt at renewal with Ana Tiscornia. Second stage Romero's work took a new direction in the 1980s with the incorporation of audiovisual language and the use of her body as a plastic element. In turn, her work was increasingly committed to the personal and social consequences of the recent past. In an interview with , she said: During those years of transition Romero made engravings in which photographs of her inked face appear, which she also printed on the works. With these works she participated in collective exhibitions that expressed the new paths taken by the nation's plastic arts towards the end of the dictatorship and during the first years of the return of democracy. In 1981 she participated in the show paying tribute to Carlos Fossatti exhibited in the Montevideo Gallery of Notaries, with the participation of artists of the Engraving Club, and in 1983 she was part of the Muestra por las libertades organized by the Culture Commission of the (AEBU) together with more than 300 national and international artists. In 1986 the engravings of this cycle were sent to the Second Havana Biennial as part of the installation A prop√≥sito de aquellos a√±os oscuros. In 1983 she presented Sal-si-puedes (\\"Get out if you can\\"), considered the first artistic installation made in Uruguay, which included texts, music, body language, plastic art, and atmosphere. After the fall of the Uruguayan Dictatorship in 1985, she returned to the country and continued work expressing the pre- Hispanic, indigenous heritage of Uruguay through performance, installations, and multimedia work. The work evokes the Charr√∫a ethnic group and recalls the , constituting a reflection on national identity and pluriculturalism in a country that was considered practically without indigenous heritage. Sal-si- puedes is part of the crisis period of the post-dictatorship era in which the perception of a country with European roots, socially homogeneous and of tolerant tradition, was questioned. Romero was nourished by the artistic and academic production (history, sociology, anthropology) that in this period questioned the historical construction of national identity. She continued working in the same direction by producing a performance, Uru-gua-y, in 1990, followed by two installations in 1992; M√°s all√° de las palabras (\\"Beyond words\\") and Garra Charr√∫a, which uses, among a heterogeneity of elements, large amounts of text written in Spanish and Guarani, rescuing the linguistic heritage of that nation, present in everyday speech today. This work was presented in Montevideo, in Havana, and at the Ludwig Forum f√ºr Internationale Kunst (Germany). In Bye Bye Yaugur√∫, a 1995 installation presented at the in Montevideo, Romero continued to work on the issue of national identity from a critical perspective. The central element of the work is a map of Uruguay represented in various ways in combination with other elements. It questions the \\"scientific\\" reading of the reality that cartography tries to show, highlighting the arbitrariness of the historical tracing of the borders that underpin nationalism. In the following years she continued to develop her work in installations and performances, at the same time that she intensified her teaching and curatorial activity. In the 2000s she exhibited several times at the national and international level, sending her work to the Havana Biennial and to the . Romero was also the author of texts, presentations, and talks on printmaking and on topics related to Uruguayan identity. Awards and recognitions In 1994 Romero received a Guggenheim Fellowship, and in 2009 the Parliament granted her a gracious pension for being considered a prominent figure in Uruguayan art. In 2005 she received the Figari Award granted by the Central Bank of Uruguay.

Originally constructed as a floating pontoon bridge in 1760. Between 1811 and 1813, Kamennoostrovsky Bridge became the first seven span timber arch bridge in Russia. In 1859, the bridge was improved with the addition of strut-supported spans. In 1952, the bridge was rebuilt to its current design with five spans.  Original construction  The bridge was originally designed by architect in 1760 to be a pontoon bridge consisting of 11 pontoon sections. In 1765, the pontoons were replaced with a floating bridge and was connected to the river abutments on piles.  19th century improvements  Between 1811 and 1813, Project Engineer Agust√≠n de Betancourt replaced the floating bridge with a seven span wooden arch bridge on timber foundations with stone abutments. The total length of the bridge in this form was . In 1859, Project Engineer conducted a complete reconstruction of the bridge. The arch design was replaced with a complex strut-frame system. In 1899, during repair work, the bridge was completely rebuilt again. This reconstruction converted the bridge from a seven span to an eleven span simple timber bridge.  20th century improvements  In 1938, the bridge was renovated. Metal I-beams replaced the wooden girders, granite facing replaced old stone abutments, and the intermediate supports were renovated. In 1953, under Project Engineers and B. B.

Chandler,13 Cal.App.3d 467 (1970), was a decision by the California Court of Appeals, 2nd District involving how strictly an editorial cartoon needed to be interpreted in lawsuits for libel. It is a significant decision in the case law of applying the First Amendment to editorial cartoons and has been cited as a persuasive authority by other U.S. courts. Prior history Sam Yorty was the Democratic Mayor of Los Angeles from 1961 to 1973. In November 1968, Richard Nixon won the presidential election and began the transition process. Yorty made it known that he would like to be the Secretary of Defense in the new Administration. The editorial cartoonist for the Los Angeles Times at this time was Paul Conrad. The possibility of Nixon choosing Yorty for such an important Cabinet position inspired him to caricature Yorty's desire. This cartoon was not flattering as it depicted a group of orderlies with a straitjacket beckoning Yorty to accompany them, presumably to a psychiatric institution. Yorty sued Otis Chandler as publisher of the paper as well as the Times, its parent company, and Conrad for $2,000,000 over the cartoon, claiming that it told the paper's readers that Yorty \\"was insane and should be placed in a straight jacket.\\" The Superior court dismissed the claim. Decision Yorty contended that the editorial cartoon had libeled him in two ways. The first defaming implication of the cartoon was that Yorty was obviously unqualified for high national office. The newspaper defendants countered that the first implication was protected by the First Amendment as an expression of opinion. The Court stated that \\"settled law\\" protected opinions about the fitness, or lack of fitness, of a person for public office and as such were not libelous \\"...even though...[the] views are those of a political adversary and are presented in rhetorical hyperbole.\\" Yorty's second claim was that the cartoon asserted Yorty's belief that his fitness for such an office was so obviously wrong that it demonstrated he was mentally incompetent. The Court ruled that the content of the cartoon was not intended to be a literal depiction and that reasonable readers would know this: > From the cartoon no reasonable person would assume more than that in the > opinion of the Los Angeles Times the mayor was not qualified for the post of > Secretary of Defense, President-elect Nixon would not appoint him, and it > was foolish of the mayor to aspire to an appointment for which he was not > qualified. No reasonable person would interpret the cartoon as a report that > Mayor Yorty had actually made the statement shown in the caption or that he > was in fact mentally deranged or insane. Because there was only one reasonable, non-defamatory interpretation of the cartoon, the Superior Court had been correct in ruling there was no libel committed and dismissing the case. Effects of the decision Although this decision was binding precedent only in the Second District of California state courts, it has been influential. It has been cited multiple times by other judicial opinions, including by other California appellate courts, by state courts from Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York and by Federal District Courts.

It passed its third reading on 30 November 2017 and received royal assent on 4 December 2017. Legislative history This law will require landlords to guarantee that any new tenancy from 1 July 2019 must be either properly insulated or contain a heating source able to make the home warm and dry. All tenancies must meet the new standards by 1 July 2024. The exact requirements are not in the bill, but will be set by the Government before 2019. Grants of up to $2000 will be available for eligible landlords to upgrade their stock. Under the previous law rentals were only required to be insulated ‚Äì by the same date in 2019 ‚Äì if it was practicable, with 100,000 homes excluded from the requirement. This law enables the Government to set standards for rental housing quality. The Healthy Homes standards will cover heating, insulation, ventilation, draught stopping, drainage and moisture. Many landlords will already meet these standards and will not have to change anything. For those that need to upgrade their properties, government grants for installing heating and insulation will be available. History Twyford's Healthy Homes Guarantee Bill was first drawn from the Parliamentary ballot in 2013, but was struck down at its first reading. Then-Labour leader Andrew Little introduced a second version, which made it through its second reading with the votes of every party except ACT and National. This allowed Labour to pick up the bill, modify it, and pass it relatively quickly. On 29 November 2017 the bill passed its third reading by 63 votes to 57, where the Labour-led Coalition Government had supported the bill to become law. The opposition parties National and ACT opposed the bill. The Healthy Homes Guarantee Bill became law after receiving royal assent on 4 December 2017.

Located near the Penang Botanic Gardens, the City Park was opened in 1972 as a recreational area and a green lung for the city's residents. True to its name, the City Park contains various recreational amenities, such as playgrounds, a skating rink, swimming pools, a graffiti corner, reflexology paths and an outdoor auditorium, all of which are open to the public. The park is maintained by the Penang Island City Council.  History  A public pool at the City Park. The water used is sourced from the nearby waterfalls. The Penang Graffiti Park was launched in 2012. The idea for the establishment of a 'Youth Park' came into being in 1970, in response to concerns over juvenile delinquency and a lack of recreational areas. At the time, the area now known as the City Park was an abandoned granite quarry. A proposal to establish a 'Youth Park' was accepted by Lim Chong Eu, the then Chief Minister of Penang. A committee was subsequently formed to explore the idea and a groundbreaking ceremony was launched late that year. In the aftermath of the 1969 race riots in Kuala Lumpur, it was decided that the park should also embody Penang's multi- cultural heritage in the \\"community of nature\\". To that end, volunteers from the various schools and youth clubs within Penang were roped in for the groundbreaking event. The Youth Park, as it was known at the time, was officially declared open in 1972 by the then Governor of Penang, Syed Hassan Barakbah. At its opening, the park was equipped with an obstacle course, a skating rink and an outdoor auditorium. More facilities were added in the years since, with the latest being the Penang Graffiti Park in 2012. The City Park is also home to two of the Penang Island City Council departments - the Community Service Department and the Landscape Department. The GBI-rated council office incorporates a rain harvesting system, an outdoor garden and vertical green walls, as well as transparent glass panels designed to allow maximum natural lighting.

Early life and family He was born in Geneva to Marie Castanet and Daniel de La Roche, and was the youngest of three children. His father was an Edinburgh-trained physician, botanist and medical translator from Geneva, who was friends with Louis Odier, the Swiss physician, medical translator and publisher. After working in Geneva, the family moved to Paris where de La Roche senior was physician to the Duke of Orl√©ans, and later at the :fr:Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Martin health centre. Career De La Roche studied at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Paris where, in 1806, he completed his medical thesis on the effects of strong heat on animal husbandry. He became a physician at L'H√¥pital Necker. He collected and studied fish on an expedition to the Spanish Balearic islands between October 1807 and May 1808; he observed and described new or little-known species from that location and made a study of the swim bladders of fish. In 1811, he carried out work on the Specific Heat of Gases in collaboration with the French physicist and chemist Jacques √âtienne B√©rard, work which won a prize from the Paris Academy of Science in 1812. Also in 1812, he read a paper at the Institut de France entitled Dissertation on the effect that air temperature has on the phenomenon of respiration. As an original researcher, his name is attached (as de La Roche or Delaroche) to the plant genus Alepidea and a number of different marine species.

It is long, wide, with an area of , an average water volume of , and a maximum depth of .  Location and catchment  Lake Chichoj is located in the municipality of San Crist√≥bal Verapaz, department of Alta Verapaz, in Guatemala. The catchment of lake has been designated as a Protected Area, in an attempt to protect the lake from environmental degradation. Water routing through the catchment is made complex by karstic groundwater flow. It is estimated that the catchment of the lake drains . The lake in turn drains superficially to the Cahab√≥n River, which flows to the Atlantic Ocean via Lake Izabal. The Pet√©ncito Hill, located along the northern shoreline of the lake, hosts a pleasant park.  Legends surrounding the catastrophic formation of the lake  According to a few oral traditions from San Crist√≥bal Verapaz, the lake would have formed catastrophically by ground collapse during an earthquake in the early 16th Century, soon after the arrival of the Dominican friars (around 1525 CE), engulfing a church and its surrounding Maya settlement. The cataclysm has been explained as a divine punishment imparted to the inhabitants of San Crist√≥bal Caccoh, following the expulsion of a Dominican friar and the refusal of the inhabitants to submit to the Christian faith. This tradition is echoed in a book published in 1648 CE by the Irish Dominican friar Thomas Gage: \\"The English-American, or a New Survey of the West Indies\\". Gage's book suffers many exaggerations, casting doubt on the validity of his testimony. However, an independent report by Spanish Dominicans also mentions the sudden formation of a lake near San Crist√≥bal, by cave collapse, during an earthquake in 1590 CE. The parochial church suffered little damage during that earthquake. The most serious report therefore suggests that the purported event would have taken place far enough from the city for the church not to be damaged, but still would have been large enough to be deemed to reported. The even did not affect the western part of the lake, which was already in existence since at least the 8th Century. Montero de Miranda wrote about the lake that by 1575 (UNAM, 1982: 223-248) it was \\"very large, long and very deep lake\\".  Hydrology  Lake surface temperatures fluctuate between in winter, and in summer. From 1979 to 2011 annual rainfall was at the lake, and at Cerro La Laguna, the highest part of the catchment. The residence time of water in the lake is therefore 35 ¬± 6 days assuming homogeneous water mixing. In actuality the lake is strongly stratified and dimictic, being composed of a highly turbid and poorly mineralized epilimnion, over a 5 ¬∞C cooler, highly mineralized hypolimnion. Most of the water therefore only restrict its circulation to the epilimnion, with an average residence time of 18 ¬± 3 days, assuming a constant mean depth of the termocline of . The lake usually homogenizes in January or February, sometimes very rapidly. The lake is fed by several streams, most noticeably by the Pan√° River in the west, which is born from the junction of Chijulj√° and Requenzal creeks. Other streams (Los Lavaderos, Chicojgual, Cerro Caj Coj) contribute very little to the lake water budget. Some springs feed the lake either directly near the shoreline (for example near Panconsul cave), or through the extensive marshlands that surround the lake. Lake Chichoj drains to R√≠o El Desag√ºe, a tributary of the Cahab√≥n River, which it joins after sinking into a cave for several hundreds of meters. Some of the sewage of San Crist√°l Verapaz is rerouted away from the lake and flows in a pipe through the marshlands before being emptied into R√≠o El Desag√ºe, downstream of lake Chichoj. The lake results from the coalescence of at least three dolines, likely resulting from the dissolution of gypsum at depth. The occurrence of gypsum is evidenced by a cluster of sulfate-bearing springs that dot the active trace of the Chixoy Polochic fault, 2 km south of the lake in the chixoy river valley, where they form large travertine fans. Discharge at these springs is much larger than what their upslope catchments can provide. The catchment of Lake Chich√≥j is the closest catchment susceptible to provide water to these springs, and it lies above the springs.  Ecological succession, eutrophication and shrinking of lake Chichoj  Eutrophication can occur naturally, during the late stage of the natural ecological succession that accompanies the infilling of a lake. It then develops slowly, over thousands of years. It develops within only a few decades when triggered by cropland fertilization, industrial contamination, or urban development. Deforestation, land fertilization, urbanization and industrialization in the catchment of lake Chichoj are all thought to have contributed in a way or the other to the massive lake contamination and eutrophication of the lake that has taken place since the 1950s. Degradation of its ecosystem motivated environmental studies starting in the 1970s. They aimed at documenting the eutrophication process, and at identifying its causes. Most concluded that the main source of eutrophication is the absence of treatment of city waste waters, rather than agriculture. The most visible consequence of eutrophication is the massive development of large floating rafts of the water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), which is untiringly harvested to prevent complete invasion of the lake open waters. The enormous amount of hyacinth removed from the lake is then composted to produce a horticultural fertilizer. Many local witnesses have reported that the extensive marshes that surround the lake were open waters in the 1950s. The presence of a well marked shoreline 1.0 ¬± 0.1 to 1.4 ¬± 0.1 m above the average current lake level and surrounding the marshes supports these testimonies. Because eutrophication leads to rapid infilling of lakes by plant debris, and conversion of open waters to marshland, it has been hypothesized that eutrophication is responsible for the reduction in the lake surface. It has been reported that if eutrophication is not mitigated rapidly, the entire lake will be converted into a marsh within 12 years (see section 'Complaint before the Latin-American water tribunal'). Whether due to plant invasion, or merely to lake level lowering, conversion of open waters to wetland cannot proceed farther inward nowadays, due to the great depth of the remaining lake. Besides, no increase in the sedimentation of the deep lake is observed since the start of eutrophication. Due to its location halfway between the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, the lake ecosystem is normally influenced by the Pacic El Ni√±o Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation. Studies are under way to determine the sensitivity of the lake hydrology to these oscillations over the past millennium.  Chromium contamination  Contamination of the lake environment by chromium started in the 1950s, and has increased dramatically until at least 2005, reaching 20 times natural background levels. It originates in industrial activities that involve leather tanning in the shoe factory of Calzado Cob√°n. The chromium does not seem to accumulate along the food chain, as it is not found in fishes and crayfishes. However, it accumulates massively in water hyacinth roots and, from there, is transferred to lake sediments through shedding of roots to the lake floor. Most of the water hyacinth biomass is actually extracted from the lake to fight eutrophication and turned into horticultural fertilizer.  Forest cover reduction  Only 20.35% of the catchment of the lake is covered by forest. Demographic growth and lack of employment are some of the factors that have promoted conversion of forested areas into subsistence agriculture, especially following the coffee price crisis. The loss of forest cover is particularly critical on steep terrain, which are most susceptible to overland flow and erosion. Soil loss results in siltation farther downslope, was well as in streams and in the lake. It also decreases water recharge of the deep aquifers.  Seismic hazard  Lake Chichoj is located within 2 km of the Chixoy-Polochic fault, a major fault of the North America-Caribbean plate boundary, which constitutes the closest and largest seismic hazard for San Crist√≥bal Verapaz, but lies within a broader array of large to intermediate seismogenic faults. The latest noticeable earthquakes include a M 4.1 quake in 2006 on the Polochic fault and a M4.8 in June 2009 on a secondary fault, NW of the lake. The sediments of the lake host a rich record of disruptions produced by past earthquakes, most notably the M 7.8 February 4th 1978 earthquake on the Motagua fault as well as a series of older M 7 earthquakes along the Polochic fault between 850 CE and 1450 CE. The lake adds hazard to the ground shaking of earthquakes. The low-lying marshlands that surround the lake are increasingly filled and urbanized. They are susceptible to seismic wave amplification, seismic wave refraction, and soil liquefaction during earthquakes, but also susceptible to flooding during earthquakes if the lake spillovers. Large waves can be produced during earthquakes, either as a result of landslides affecting the lake inner slopes, or by seismic resonance (seiche waves).  Ground collapse  Various geologic data suggest that Lake Chichoj stretches above of a body of gypsum well exposed on outcrops farther west. There, gypsum dissolution is responsible for repeated mountain flank collapses in the valley of Los Chorros. The lake occupies at least three coalescing dolines likely formed by dissolution of gypsum at depth. The dolines are probably only a few tens of thousands of years old, and the marshlands that surround the lake are likely covering similar, sediment-filled dolines. They are therefore susceptible to resumption of ground subsidence, if gypsum keeps dissolving at depth. The new phase of subsidence could either be slow and continuous, or pulsed, and possibly fast, even instantaneous. It is even possible that the marshes are actively subsiding, since no monitoring of subsidence has ever been undertaken. Subsidence might also be occurring under the combined effect of slow sediment compaction and oxidation/decomposition of the organic matter trapped in the sediments. The accommodation space created by the subsidence would be filled by mineral and organic sediments over the marshlands.  Floods  The wetlands that surround the lake spread over an area of 0.63 km2, and are enclosed into an ancient shoreline. The origin of this larger open water lake remains unclear. If the lake level has remained stable fallen, then the reduction in lake size is solely due to the conversion of these open waters into wetlands. Alternately, lake shrinking my reflects a slight lowering of the average lake level, possibly due to a less efficient drainage at the lake outlet. In any case, it cannot be excluded that the lake level reverts in the future to its ancient stand, flooding areas that have now been filled and urbanized. Besides, the outlet drains to a cave that might get partially of completely obstructed by debris following large storms. Water ponding upstream of the cave could result in an increase in the lake level of 4,0 ¬± 0,3 m before surface overflow is achieved near the cave.  Complaint before the Latin-American water tribunal  On 12 September 2008, during a hearing at the Latin-American water tribunal, the ONG ASOVERAPAZ warned that continuation of eutrophicacion in Lake Chichoj will result in its conversion to a marshland within 12 years. That day, mayor Leopoldo Ical Jul promised to implement various mitigation procedures, including the building of an ecological shelter on the Pet√©ncito hill, which is a former island in the lake, now surrounded by wetlands on three sides. According to the studies presented to the TLA, the lake contains elevated levels of fecal matter, which are held responsible for the deterioration of the lacustrine flora and fauna. Considering the ever-increasing contamination, the court opted for the ratification of an agreement between the complainant Asociaci√≥n para el Desarrollo Integral Verapaz ASOVERAPAZ and the denounced, namely the municipality of San Crist√≥bal Verapaz and the development counsel of Alta Verapaz.

Heidegger agreed to discuss his political past provided that the interview be published posthumously. It was published five days after his death, on 31 May 1976. English translation by William J. Richardson in It is translated by William J. Richardson into English. Summary In the interview, Heidegger defended his entanglement with National Socialism in two ways: first, he argued that there was no alternative, saying that he was trying to save the university (and science in general) from being politicized and thus had to compromise with the Nazi administration. Second, he admitted that he saw an \\"awakening\\" (Aufbruch) which might help to find a \\"new national and social approach,\\" but said that he changed his mind about this in 1934, largely prompted by the violence of the Night of the Long Knives. In his interview Heidegger defended as double-speak his 1935 lecture describing the \\"inner truth and greatness of this movement.\\" He affirmed that Nazi informants who observed his lectures would understand that by \\"movement\\" he meant National Socialism. However, Heidegger asserted that his dedicated students would know this statement was no apologia for the NSDAP. Rather, he meant it as he expressed it in the parenthesis that he did not read out yet claimed in the interview was present from the beginning (and included in his Introduction to Metaphysics (1953)), namely, \\"the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity.\\" The L√∂with account from 1936 has been cited to contradict the account given in the Der Spiegel interview in two ways: that he did not make any decisive break with National Socialism in 1934, and that Heidegger was willing to entertain more profound relations between his philosophy and political involvement. The Der Spiegel interviewers did not bring up Heidegger's 1949 quotation comparing the industrialization of agriculture to the extermination camps. In fact, the interviewers were not in possession of much of the evidence now known for Heidegger's Nazi sympathies.For critical readings of the interview (published in 1976 as \\"Only a God Can Save Us,\\" Der Spiegel), see the \\"Special Feature on Heidegger and Nazism\\" in Critical Inquiry 15:2 (Winter 1989), particularly the contributions by J√ºrgen Habermas and Blanchot.

After graduating from Moscow University in 1889, Leonas held a government job at various courts in Suwa≈Çki and Uzbekistan. He was fired after supporting the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) during the Russian Revolution of 1905. He returned to Lithuania and took up private law practice, which he had for 32 years. In 1907, he was elected to the second short-lived State Duma of the Russian Empire. During World War I, Leonas retreated to Russia and was deputy chairman of the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers. In March 1917, he was one of the founders of the Democratic National Freedom League. He returned to newly independent Lithuania in 1918 and began working on drafting some of the fundamental legislation. He became the first Minister of Justice in November 1918 and the fourth Minister of Internal Affairs in April 1919. He worked to organize judicial system and establish local municipal institutions in the chaotic post-war years. He retired from active politics in October 1919, but continued to consult the Lithuanian government on major pieces of legislation. Leonas became a professor and dean of the Law Faculty at the University of Lithuania. Early life Leonas, the youngest of 11 children, was born on 16 November 1864 in near Gudeliai, Suwa≈Çki Governorate, to a family of Lithuanian farmers. After studying at primary schools in ≈†unskai, he went on to study at the Marijampolƒó Gymnasium which he graduated in 1884 with a silver medal. With financial help from his eldest brother priest Silvestras Leonaviƒçius, Leonas continued his studies at the Law Faculty of Moscow University. He graduated in 1889 as a Candidate of Sciences. As a university student, Leonas joined Lithuanian cultural life by leading a secret society of Lithuanian students that traced its roots to 1860 (there were about 50 Lithuanian students in Moscow at the time). His first articles were published in Lietuvi≈°kasis balsas in 1887. He assisted in organizing the publication of ≈†viesa and Varpas. Over the following decades, Leonas contributed articles to numerous Lithuanian periodicals, including ≈™kininkas, Lietuvos ≈´kininkas, Vilniaus ≈æinios, Viltis, Lietuvos ≈æinios, Au≈°rinƒó, ≈†altinis. In 1933‚Äì1938, he was the responsible editor of the Kult≈´ra magazine. His bibliography numbers 165 items. After the graduation, Leonas became a court clerk (judge candidate) in the Suwa≈Çki district court. Due to Russification policies, as a Roman Catholic, he could not get a government job in Lithuania. In 1892, he was transferred to Uzbekistan. He worked as a court interrogator in Tashkent, as justice of the peace and assistant prosecutor in Samarkand, and district judge in Margilan. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, he supported the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) and was dismissed from his government job. He returned to Lithuania in September 1906 taking up private attorney practice in Kaunas and joining Lithuanian cultural life. He became chairman (1908‚Äì1914) of the cultural Daina Society that organized various music and theater performances, joined the Lithuanian Scientific Society, and helped organizing the First Congress of Lithuanian Women in 1907. Leonas was the only man on the congress' presidium. Political career Russian Empire In 1907, Leonas was elected to the second State Duma of the Russian Empire where he joined the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets). However, the Duma was dismissed in less than four months during the Coup of June 1907. In 1911, he hired Martynas Yƒças as an assistant and became his mentor. With his help, Yƒças was elected in the September 1912 elections to the State Duma and became an active and influential politician. With Yƒças' help, Leonas was elected to the Central Committee of the Kadets. Leonas prepared a project of Lithuanian autonomy that together with Yƒças presented to the Kadet leadership on 28 March 1916. Among other things, the project asked to attach the Suwa≈Çki Governorate to Lithuania. The Kadets rejected the project in May and Leonas resigned from the party in protest. The outbreak of World War I presented an opportunity for Lithuanians to seek autonomy if not independence from the Russian Empire. To strengthen their political position, former and current Lithuanian members of the State Duma decided to establish the Representative Committee that would have more authority in representing the Lithuanians. However, the Committee soon disbanded as its chairman Leonas resigned in January 1915 in protest of Andrius Bulota's and Mykolas Janu≈°keviƒçius' withdrawals from the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers. The society was officially registered on 27 November and its founding meeting took place on 4 December 1914. Leonas was elected to its Central Committee. In mid 1915, during the Great Retreat of the Russian Imperial Army, Leonas evacuated from Lithuania to Russia where he continued to work on the war relief efforts becoming vice-chairman of the Lithuanian Society. In March 1917, Leonas was one of the founders of the Democratic National Freedom League, a party of secular and liberal platform that is often known simply as Santara. As Santara's representative, he participated in the Petrograd Seimas in June 1917. Lithuanian activists hotly debated political future of Lithuania and split into two camps: those that envisioned fully independent Lithuania (mostly right-wing Party of National Progress and Christian Democrats) and those that believed that Lithuania should seek autonomy within Russia (mostly socialist-leaning parties, including Leonas). Independent Lithuania Fourth cabinet of ministers (Prime Minister Mykolas Sle≈æeviƒçius). Leonas sits third from left. In May 1918, Leonas returned to Lithuania and joined the legal committee of the Council of Lithuania. On 11 November 1918, he became the first Minister of Justice in the cabinet of Augustinas Voldemaras. This cabinet was formed by members of the Party of National Progress and their allies; Leonas was the only representative of a different political party. At the start of the Lithuanian‚ÄìSoviet War, Voldemaras and Antanas Smetona, chairman of the Council of Lithuania, departed for Germany. Voldemaras left Leonas as his deputy. Left without its leaders, the government resigned so that Mykolas Sle≈æeviƒçius could organize a new cabinet. Leonas remained Minister of Justice in the new cabinet. He refused to join the leftist cabinet of Pranas Dovydaitis, but returned to the fourth cabinet as Minister of Internal Affairs (April‚ÄìOctober 1919). As minister, Leonas propagated ideas of Rechtsstaat (rule of law) and worked to organize, standardize, and improve the judicial system and local municipal institutions. In December 1918, the government passed temporary law on the judicial system which established the Lithuanian Tribunal (supreme court), district courts, and local courts (justice of the peace). Leonas worked to appoint judges and other court officials, but there was an acute lack of qualified personnel. This temporary law was replaced only in 1933. Already in early 1918, together with Tadas Petkeviƒçius and Kostas Jablonskis, he began working on laws governing administrative divisions and local self- government. The law was passed on 10 October 1919, just few days after his tenure of minister ended. On 29 April ‚Äì 5 May 1919, Leonas held a conference of local representatives during which he emphasized the importance of state building from the ground up, explained competence and jurisdiction of local institutions, discussed the relationship between the central and local government. Leonas spent a lot of effort in rooting out various self-declared parish committees. Leonas also worked on drafting other fundamental laws, including on elections, passports, societies and associations, press, but most of those became effective after his tenure. Academic career Leonas retired from active politics in October 1919 and returned to private law practice (in total, he had a private practice for 32 years). In late 1920, Leonas organized the Council of Attorneys, the self-regulating national professional organization of attorneys in Lithuania, and was elected as its first chairman. At the time, Lithuania had 21 officially registered attorneys. He was elected chairman again in 1926 and was annually reelected until his death in 1938. Together with Antanas Tumƒónas, he represented priest Konstantinas Ol≈°auskas accused of murder during his high profile trial in October 1929. While no longer a member of the government, Leonas still lent his legal expertise. He was chairman of the Lithuanian electoral commission that organized democratic elections to the Constituent Assembly and Seimas in 1920‚Äì1926. He also consulted on some of the major legislation, including the Constitution of Lithuania and land reform. As a respected authority on legal matters, Leonas was considered several times by the Seimas for President of Lithuania. In 1923‚Äì1926, he was a member of the council of the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union. He also began teaching law at the Higher Courses that evolved into the University of Lithuania by 1922. His first lecture in February 1920 was on the basics of law. In 1921‚Äì1925, he also taught at special courses for municipal officers. At the new university, Leonas became dean of the Law Faculty. He lectured on fundamentals of law, political economy, history of the philosophy of law, ethics. He published several well received textbooks based on his lecture notes. In 1932, during the 10th anniversary celebrations, Leonas received an honorary PhD from the university. In 1933, the Ministry of Education rejected Leonas' request to extend his university tenure beyond the retirement age of 65. The university found a loophole ‚Äì Leonas was elected as honorary professor and could continue to lecture albeit with no compensation. He retired from teaching in 1934, but returned in fall 1936 with a new course on sociology. The 400-page textbook, published already after Leonas' death, systematically analyzed the principles of sociology and became a pioneering work on sociology in Lithuania. Leonas cared to support financially struggling students. In 1927, he initiated the Jonas Basanaviƒçius Fund attached to the Council of Attorneys. The fund, about 28,000 litas, spent its earnings on scholarships to students. In 1931, from his personal funds, he established a 1,000 litas prize for student scientific work. Employees of the Law Faculty followed suit and established two prizes (500 litas each) for best paper. Knowing his preferences, the university spent his retirement dinner funds on scholarships. Leonas died suddenly on 12 May 1938. Instead of buying flowers for his funeral, mourners were asked to donate the money to struggling students and victims of a large fire in Palanga. In 1924, Leonas constructed a two-floor (engineer ) home in Kaunas. The third floor and the attic were added in 1929 and the facade acquired Art Deco features. The house was divided into apartments where Leonas and his son-in-law Steponas Kairys lived; other apartments were rented out.

He also served as suffect consul for the nundinium of September to December 102 as the colleague of Lucius Antonius Albus. Bernard R√©my notes that his cognomen, \\"Homullus\\", appears primarily in Italy, so this may be where his origins lie.R√©my, Les carri√®res s√©natoriales dans les provinces romaines d'Anatolie au Haut-Empire (31 av. J.-C. - 284 ap. J.-C.) (Istanbul: Institut Fran√ßais d'√âtudes Anatoliennes-Georges Dum√©zil, 1989), p. 205 Pliny the Younger mentions Homullus in three of his letters. In the first, Pliny mentions that Homullus and Tiberius Catius Caesius Fronto defended Julius Bassus against charges of malfeasance while governor of Bithynia and Pontus.Pliny, Epistulae, IV.9.15 In the second, Pliny writes how he and Homullus defended Varenus Rufus against exactly the same charges.Epistulae, V.20 In the third, Pliny writes that Homullus spoke in the matter of reforming the rules of Senate elections.Epistulae, VI.19.3 Only one office is securely attested for Homullus: governor of the imperial province of Cappadocia; Werner Eck dates his tenure in that province from the year 111 to the year 114.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 351-355 He was the first governor of this province after its creation when the earlier province that covered most of Asia Minor was divided into Cappadocia and Galatia. While he was governor, the emperor Trajan visited the province while he was engaged on his Parthian campaign; when the Armenian king Parthamasiris demanded that Trajan send to him Homullus, Trajan instead sent Homullus' son.Dio Cassius, LXVIII.19 This son has been identified as the suffect consul of 128, Marcus Junius Homullus. Homullus may have been the M. Junius who was pontifex in the year 101-102, whose calator was M. Junius Epaphroditus.,  Homullus and the Emperor  William McDermott has identified this Junius Homullus as the Homullus who is quoted in the Historia Augusta as saying to Trajan, \\"Domitian was a bad emperor, but had good advisors.\\"\\"Septimus Alexander\\", 65.6. Marcus Valerius Homullus, consul ordinary in 152, has also been identified as this Homullus. McDermott believes this anecdote was drawn from the hypothetical source for the Historia Augusta, the history of Marius Maximus. He notes that the identification is only possible if Homullus had an opportunity to confront Trajan, and points out the two were together in Cappadocia. Trajan had come under the influence of his military advisors, and had decided to expand the borders of the empire. \\"Such an eastern campaign must have been considered a dubious exploit, or even disastrous, by many of the members of the senate, even though it only gradually became evident how far the emperor would go,\\" McDermott writes. \\"Surely Hadrian, if he were consulted, and his clique must have been appalled.\\"McDermott, \\"Homullus and Trajan\\", Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, 29 (1980), p. 118 McDermott speculates further that Homullus counted on Trajan's affability to avoid a charge of maiestas laesa; however, Trajan decided to replace him with Lucius Catilius Severus. \\"Whether Homullus held any further office is not known,\\" McDermott writes, \\"but his confrontation with Trajan was so much in accordance with Hadrian's future actions as emperor that he probably fared well after Trajan's death.\\"McDermott, \\"Homullus and Trajan\\", p. 119  References  1st- century Romans 2nd-century Romans Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Roman governors of Cappadocia ","title":"Marcus Junius Homullus"},{"id":"56012001","text":"The Jodhpur‚ÄìBikaner Railway (JBR) was a metre gauge railway, jointly owned and operated by the Jodhpur State and Bikaner State until 1924 when the system was split between the newly formed Jodhpur State Railway and Bikaner State Railway. \\"British Library Archives and Manuscripts Catalogue\\" - Search; Retrieved 18 Nov 2016  History  The JBR had its beginnings as the Jodhpur Railway with the decision by Maharaja Jaswant Singh, to build a railway line from Bitoora to his capital city Jodhpur.

Early Life  Hollingsworth was born and raised a few miles north of Sanger, Texas. In 1935 he entered North Texas Agricultural College, and attended for one year before transferring to Texas A&M.; While there he was a member of the Corps of Cadets and graduated in May 1940 with a degree in agriculture. Upon graduation he was commissioned a US Army reserve officer, and took a job in Houston before being called to active duty two months later.  World War II  Hollingsworth served in the Third Army during World War II with the 2nd Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment and was wounded five times. Vietnam War Brigadier General Hollingsworth served as assistant commander of the 1st Infantry Division in 1966‚Äì67. Hollingsworth and new division commander Major General William E. DePuy relieved a number of commanders whom they regarded as combat ineffective. During this tour he was profiled by English journalist Nicholas Tomalin in his story The General Goes Zapping Charlie Cong, which was published in The Sunday Times on 5 June 1966. After reading of these activities DePuy and Hollingsworth were reprimanded by Chief of Staff of the United States Army Harold K. Johnson who wrote to DePuy: \\"If I had wanted a lead scout in command of the 1st Division you would not have gotten the job. Your value and Holly's is proportional to the responsibility that you have for something over 15,000 men. Your job is not to shoot VC. Your job is to see that other people shoot VC.\\" Tomalin's story was later used as part of the inspiration for the character Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore in the film Apocalypse Now. On 31 August 1967, as a result of the criticisms of the Army National Guard during the 1967 Detroit riot, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army set up a board under Hollingsworth, then deputy commanding general of the United States Army Test and Evaluation Command, to look into the leadership of both the National Guard and the Army Reserve. In 1972 Hollingsworth was serving as Commander of Third Regional Assistance Command in III Corps. During the Battle of An L·ªôc, part of the North Vietnamese Easter Offensive, Hollingsworth was responsible for organizing the air support that allowed the Army of the Republic of Vietnam forces to hold the town and ultimately defeat the People's Army of Vietnam assault. During an interview taped by CBS, Hollingsworth said that he would never entertain a proposal by the Red Cross that the two sides should declare a temporary cease-fire at An Loc to treat the wounded. On another occasion, speaking of An Loc's attackers, he told reporters he intended to \\"kill them all before they get back to Cambodia.\\" In each case it was clear that Hollingsworth considered himself the effective commander at An L·ªôc, even though a South Vietnamese officer was technically in charge. COMUSMACV General Creighton Abrams reportedly instructed Hollingsworth to \\"shut his mouth.\\" In April 1972 Hollingsworth commented on the declining morale and discipline among US forces remaining in South Vietnam stating: \\"It is very common to observe U.S. soldiers driving and riding in trucks along the roads and highways in the Long Binh-Bien Hoa-Saigon area who are a disgrace to the Army and to the United States... Seldom does one see such a soldier with a proper haircut wearing a complete and proper uniform. Frequently, they wear no headgear and are in their undershirts. Many times they are bare to the waist. Further, many of our soldiers wear defaced hats and jackets with unauthorized embroidered and stenciled symbols and sayings, pins, buttons, and other items that give them a hippie like appearance. In addition, these soldiers often operate their vehicles in an equally careless manner...Standards (observed off post) merely reflect standards practiced on post.\\" Post-Vietnam Hollingsworth served as commander U.S. Army Alaska until October 1971 when he was replaced by Major General Charles M. Gettys. Hollingsworth served as commander of I Corps in the Republic of Korea from mid-1973. During his time in Korea Hollingsworth updated the existing operational plans for defense against a North Korean attack, OPLAN 5027, from a largely defensive strategy to a forward-based offensive strategy known as OPLAN 5027-74, in which after blunting the initial North Korean assault the US/ROK forces would seize Kaesong and then go on to capture Pyongyang. Hollingsworth retired and was replaced by Lieutenant General John H. Cushman in March 1976. Hollingsworth's planned retirement was apparently accelerated following a January 13 1976 interview with the Wall Street Journal where Hollingsworth stated that he had prepared for \\"a short violent war\\" following any North Korean attack that the US/ROK forces would win in 9 days. He stated: \\"We'll need five days and nights of real violence, after that we'll need four more days to tidy up the battlefield.\\" Civilian career Following his retirement from the Army, Hollingsworth was commissioned to prepare an analysis of the Army's conventional warfighting capabilities, particularly to repel a Warsaw Pact attack in Europe, this \\"Hollingsworth Report\\" published in 1976 was used to procure increased funding for Army and NATO readiness. Later life Hollingsworth died on 2 March 2010 in San Antonio, Texas and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

In this statement he is > taking existentia and essentia according to their metaphysical meaning, > which, from Plato's time on, has said that essentia precedes existentia. > Sartre reverses this statement.

She belonged to a wealthy family linked to the land and, politically, to the Colorado Party. Her father was deputy of that party for Artigas Department, and her uncle, Dr. Jos√© Romeu, was Secretary of State, both during the second government of Jos√© Batlle y Ord√≥√±ez.

Her openly stated homosexual orientation, which could only be recognized implicitly at the time, also contributed to that perception. Avegno died in strange circumstances in Lomas de Zamora, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, as a fugitive from Uruguayan justice. The scandal unleashed by the debts that she left after escaping from the country sent a shockwave through the government of Batlle y Ord√≥√±ez. The official cause of death was suicide.

There are large numbers of broadly egg- shaped bracts long and wide and smaller paired bracteoles at the base of the flowers. The floral cup is hairy and about long. The sepal lobes are egg- shaped to triangular, about long and glabrous. The petals are white, egg- shaped to almost round and about long. There are about 30-35 stamens which are about long. Taxonomy and naming Kunzea juniperoides was first formally described in 2016 by Hellmut R. Toelken and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The specific epithet (juniperoides) refers to the similarity of the leaves of this species to those of miniature forms of Juniperus communis. (The suffix -oides means \\"likeness\\" in Latin.) There are two subspecies: * Kunzea juniperoides subsp. juniperoides which has leaves which are mostly long and grows in low heath near Braidwood; * Kunzea juniperoides subsp. pervervosa which has leaves which are mostly long and grows in woodland on the Pigeon House Range. Distribution and habitat This kunzea grows in heath and woodland on the South Coast and nearby tablelands of New South Wales.

Krantz was raped and murdered by Ephrem Yohannes, a 23-year-old Ethiopian immigrant, in Biskopsg√•rden where her body was found. Yohannes was found guilty of Krantz's murder and received a 16-year prison sentence and deportation on release.  Background  On 26 September 2010, Elin Krantz, a 27-year-old Swedish woman from Falk√∂ping, fell asleep on the tram after an evening enjoying the nightlife of Gothenburg. Footage from Security cameras showed that Krantz was then followed by a man who attempted to rape her and subsequently beat her to death. Krantz's severely beaten corpse was found the next day in Gothenburg's Biskopsg√•rden district. On 28 September, 23-year old Ephrem Yohannes, an Ethiopian citizen with a residence permit with clothes and appearance similar to that of the man captured on the security cameras, was arrested by plainclothes policemen at Gothenburg Central Station. Krantz' DNA was found on his clothing and Yohannes' DNA was found on her body.  Trial  Yohannes was convicted for murder and aggravated rape. In March 2011, Yohannes was sentenced to 18 years in prison and subsequent deportation. He was to serve 16 years (About 10 1/2 years with good behavior) as a two-year reduction is applied to deportation sentences. The first sentence was appealed to the Hovr√§tt as the accused pleaded innocence. The prosecutor Stina Lundberg argued for a life sentence and aggravated sexual assault. In the autumn of 2011, the Court of Appeals upheld the original sentence. During the Hovr√§tt court proceeding, news broke that the wife and children of Yohannes had left Europe due to several threats to their lives. The parents of Elin Krantz and her five siblings were awarded criminal damages of around ‚Ç¨60,000. Yohannes was initially imprisoned in Norrt√§ljeanstalten, a high security prison in Norrt√§lje, but after attacking a fellow inmate he was transferred to Salbergaanstalten prison in Sala. Yohannes has received several warnings for inappropriate behaviour.  Aftermath  Krantz's body was interred at the Sankt Olof kyrkog√•rd cemetery in her hometown of Falk√∂ping. In October 2010, over 1000 people gathered in the district - where her body was found - to commemorate her and to protest the violence.

His exact origin is unknown. The nisba \\"al-Tunisi\\" has led to suggestions that he was born in Tunis, but his other nisba of \\"al- Iyadi\\" suggests ties to the Iyad, a clan of the Arab Banu Hilal tribe settled near Msila. Pro-Shi'ite, he was court poet of the Isma'ili Shi'a caliphs al- Qa'im, al-Mansur, and al-Mu'izz. His reputation during his lifetime was considerable, and he was highly regarded by later critics. However, possibly due to his pro-Shi'a partisanship, which may have led to an attempted damnatio memoriae after the Zirid dynasty turned to Sunni Islam, or due to shifting literary tastes, none of his works survives in complete form. His work survives mostly in fragments that were appreciated and gathered together by later anthologists for their vivid and evocative language, such as descriptions of the Fatimid navy, a galloping horse, or the so-called Lake Palace in the palace city of Mansuriya. The only evidently pro-Shi'a works surviving are a eulogy for al-Mansur, and a moving description of the end of the famous anti-Fatimid rebel Abu Yazid. Al-Iyadi died in 976, probably in Cairo, where he had followed the Fatimid court following the Fatimid conquest of Egypt in 969.

He is the first person \\"to devise a written version of a language called Emai\\", a language reported in 1997 to be spoken by about 30,000 Emai people in Edo State of Nigeria. He has been described as one with \\"fevered intellect, the sharp chin, the untamable kineticism.\\"  Biography  Schaefer was born in Minnesota in 1949. From 1971 to 1973, he served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Afghanistan where he taught English language at Kabul University. Of the experience he said ‚ÄúWhat it did for me was open me up to the vast cultural currents that traversed Afghanistan over historical time. Alexander the Great and his armies had moved through. Genghis Khan had moved through. The great Mogul Empires had housed themselves there, and various other significant populations that I had read about in school. Now I was able to see the remnants of their buildings, their wells.‚Äù  Work on Emai  Ron Schaefer at Rendleman Hall, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. Between 1981 and 1985, he taught in the linguistics department at the University of Benin. It was there he discovered the language Emai, spoken by one of his students Francis Egbokhare. Emai is spoken about 60 miles from Benin, in the Afemmai Hills of Edo State. Schaefer had first planned to study all the languages of the region, but eventually relented. The motivation for his work on Emai, he said, was to prevent the language from going into extinction. ‚ÄúRight now, it would be very difficult to find a storyteller, a chief who knew the stories and knew how to tell them as the Emai traditionally told their stories. It‚Äôs just not possible. So today, you have young people who are training to be linguists, and they work with a native speaker. They will find some piece of information, or they will find a sound pattern or a syntactic pattern and they will think this is brand new. It may be true, but it will probably come about as a part of incomplete learning on the part of young people because parents are not using the language in the home, and schools certainly don‚Äôt use it. We have been fortunate that some schools have used our stories to begin to teach the language, but it is really an uphill battle. By studying your language you learn something about who you are, especially at a university,‚Äù Schaefer and Egbokhare have worked together for over thirty years.

The lowest temperature at which a fuel or oil will pour is called a pour point. Wax crystals, which form at lower temperatures, may interfere with lubrication of mechanical equipment. High-quality pour point depressants can lower a pour point of an oil additive by as much as 40¬∞C. Methods Pour point depressants do not lower the temperature at which wax crystals begin to form, called the cloud point, or the amount of wax that is formed‚Äîpour point depressants work by altering the crystal shape and size, which inhibits lateral crystal growth. There are two known methods by which this may be achieved: surface adsorption and co-crystallization. Types Any reduction in an oil's pour point depends on both the composition and properties of the oil, as well as the type of pour point depressant used. Other factors are the substance's relative molecular weight, its chemical composition, and the substance's concentration in the oil. If the concentration of pour point depressant is too high, there may be a visible effect on viscosity at higher temperatures. Pour point depressants are only effective on refined oils. Non-refined oils contain polyaromatic hydrocarbons and resins which act as antagonists against synthetic pour point depressants. Pour point depressants are also ineffective for engine oils with a viscosity above SAE 30. Generally they are most effective on thinner oils like SAE 10, SAE 20 or SAE 30 grade oils. Alkylaromatics and aliphatic polymers are two types of pour point depressants that are commercially available. Most commercially available pour point depressants are organic polymers, but nonpolymeric substances such as phenyltristearyloxysilane and pentaerythritol tetrastearate may also be effective. Winter 1980-1981 In 1981 there was a problem with lubricating oil pumpability. The same thing happened the following winter, along with reports that oil would not flow out of containers. The issue seemed to be caused by olefin copolymers which caused the oil to gel in cold temperatures.

Life Ferruccio Valobra was born in Turin from a Jewish family. Captain of the Alpini during the First World War, he was decorated with the Silver Medal of Military Valor. In the post-war period he worked as an industrial expert and sales representative. He was married and father of a child. Radiated from the army following the 1938 Fascist racial laws, at the outbreak of the Second World War he was forced to displace to Carmagnola in the frazione of San Bernardo. Of anti-fascist ideas, he joined the Italian Republican Party, then clandestine. After the Badoglio Proclamation of 8 September 1943 he took part at the Carmagnola's resistance and became commander (Capitano Rossi) of a partisan group operating in the surrounding area. Betrayed by an anonymous delator on 8 September 1944, he was incarcerated and tortured by elements of the Fascist Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana, the so-called Repubblichini. He was sentenced to death by firing squad on 21 September 1944 and he was executed the following day in the Martinetto shooting range in Turin. Before his death, Valobra managed to write two letters, which ended with the words addressed to his wife and daughter: I hope that my sacrifice like that of my companions will serve to give you a better tomorrow, in a more beautiful Italy as you and I have always desired in the depths of our soul.Piero Malvezzi - Giovanni Pirelli (a cura di), Lettere di condannati a morte della Resistenza italiana: 8 settembre 1943-25 aprile 1945, Torino, Einaudi, 2003, pp. 321-322.

She performed the first mammogram in Australia at the Rachel Forster Hospital and demonstrated the benefits of mammography as a breast cancer screening tool. Biography Dalgarno was born in Sydney in 1901 and studied medicine at the University of Sydney's Women's College. She graduated in 1925 and was hired as a resident medical officer at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, where she worked in the radiology department. After marrying Harold McCredie, a general practitioner, in 1928, she established a radiological practice based out of their home in Campsie. Her home practice included an x-ray machine installed in the dining room and a laundry that was converted into a darkroom for developing x-ray films. In 1939, she began working at the Rachel Forster Hospital in Redfern and the Renwick Hospital for Infants in Summer Hill; she also worked at the Western Suburbs Hospital in Croydon during World War II. In 1949, Dalgarno and her partner Mollie Cronin opened a new practice on Macquarie Street in central Sydney. She also continued to work at the Rachel Forster Hospital, where Kathleen Cuningham had established a clinic for the diagnosis and treatment of breast lumps. Dalgarno modified an x-ray machine so that it could be used to produce mammograms (low- energy x-rays of the breasts), and in the early 1950s she performed the first mammogram in Australia. In a study of 1000 asymptomatic women, she demonstrated the benefits of mammography as a screening tool to detect and treat breast cancer in its early stages, but widespread use of mammography was unfeasible at the time due to technological limitations and high radiation doses. Dalgarno died in 1983. Legacy Australia adopted a national breast cancer screening program three decades after Dalgarno's work on mammography. BreastScreen, an Australian organisation that provides free breast cancer screening for eligible women, named one of their mobile screening buses \\"Marjorie\\" in honour of Dalgarno.

Equivalently, a nonblocker is the complement of a dominating set. The computational problem of finding the largest nonblocker in a graph was formulated by , who observed that it belongs to MaxSNP. Although computing a dominating set is not fixed-parameter tractable under standard assumptions, the complementary problem of finding a nonblocker of a given size is fixed-parameter tractable. In graphs with no isolated vertices, every maximal nonblocker (one to which no more vertices can be added) is itself a dominating set. Kernelization One way to construct a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for the nonblocker problem is to use kernelization, an algorithmic design principle in which a polynomial-time algorithm is used to reduce a larger problem instance to an equivalent instance whose size is bounded by a function of the parameter. For the nonblocker problem, an input to the problem consists of a graph G and a parameter k, and the goal is to determine whether G has a nonblocker with k or more vertices. This problem has an easy kernelization that reduces it to an equivalent problem with at most 2k vertices. First, remove all isolated vertices from G, as they cannot be part of any nonblocker. Once this has been done, the remaining graph must have a nonblocker that includes at least half of its vertices; for instance, if one 2-colors any spanning tree of the graph, each color class is a nonblocker and one of the two color classes includes at least half the vertices. Therefore, if the graph with isolated vertices removed still has 2k or more vertices, the problem can be solved immediately. Otherwise, the remaining graph is a kernel with at most 2k vertices. Dehne et al. improved this to a kernel of size at most tfrac{5}{3}k+3. Their method involves merging pairs of neighbors of degree-one vertices until all such vertices have a single neighbor, and removing all but one of the degree-one vertices, leaving an equivalent instance with only one degree-one vertex. Then, they show that (except for small values of k, which can be handled separately) this instance must either be smaller than the kernel size bound or contain a k-vertex blocker. Once a small kernel has been obtained, an instance of the nonblocker problem may be solved in fixed-parameter tractable time by applying a brute-force search algorithm to the kernel. Applying faster (but still exponential) time bounds leads to a time bound for the nonblocker problem of the form O(2.5154^k+n). Even faster algorithms are possible for certain special classes of graphs.

Smithy's work was complicated because it predated heart-lung machines or open heart surgery. Though his procedure did not become a definitive treatment for valvular heart disease, he introduced the technique of injecting novocaine into the heart to avoid arrhythmias during surgery, and he showed that it was feasible to access and operate on the heart's valves. A graduate of the University of Virginia School of Medicine, Smithy completed a surgical residency in Charleston, South Carolina, and then practiced surgery at Roper Hospital in Charleston. He also began working with a colleague in a dog laboratory to devise a valvulotomy (surgical treatment for diseased heart valves). Smithy's interest in heart valve dysfunction was also personal; he suffered from narrowing of the aortic valve related to rheumatic heart disease. As Smithy began to operate on a series of patients with heart valve disease, he started to correspond with eminent heart surgeon Alfred Blalock, hoping that ultimately Blalock would agree to perform a valvulotomy on him. Smithy had a patient come to Baltimore so that Blalock and Smithy could operate on the patient together. When that patient died on the operating table, Blalock refused to be involved with further surgery of that type. Smithy died at Roper Hospital of cardiac asthma, pneumonia and another attack of rheumatic fever. His death came a few months after he performed his first valvulotomy; he had been unable to convince anyone to perform the surgery on him. Early life Smithy was born in Norfolk, Virginia. He was the son of Rosalia () and Horace Smithy Sr. The elder Smithy, who was lifelong friends with Assistant Secretary of Commerce Monroe Johnson, worked in real estate before acquiring his own 50-person real estate brokerage firm, the H. G. Smithy Company. Until high school, Horace Jr. was educated at the Friends School in Washington. At some point during his childhood, he suffered from rheumatic fever. Smithy attended Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. He was becoming sick with frequent colds, which were thought to be weather-related, so he was sent to the Miami Military Academy. For college, Smithy went to the University of Florida and became a multisport athlete there (football, baseball and boxing). The New York Times indicated that he once boxed professionally and played professional baseball. Smithy went to the University of Virginia for medical school. When he bought a stethoscope at the beginning of his studies, he listened to his own heart and noted a loud murmur. While in medical school, Smithy married Sarah (), whom he had met while studying in Florida. They had two children. Early career Smithy moved on to a surgical internship and residency at the Medical College of South Carolina in Charleston. He may have chosen to go to Charleston in part because the father of a high school classmate had once been the chief surgeon and residency program director at Roper Hospital. The hospital was not affiliated with the medical school when his classmate's father worked there, but it was the medical school's primary teaching site when Smithy arrived. Remaining at Roper Hospital after finishing his residency in 1942, Smithy established a surgical practice. He also worked in an animal laboratory at the medical school, using dogs to learn more about valve function and possible repair. Smithy's interest in this area was heightened by his own heart valve problem; he suffered from narrowing of the aortic valve related to his childhood bout of rheumatic fever. By 1946, Smithy had devised what he called a valvulotome, an instrument he used to cut away scar tissue from the aortic valve. He made a presentation on the device at an American College of Surgeons (ACS) forum. The next year at the annual ACS meeting, he gave a more formal presentation. An Associated Press science editor heard Smithy's talk at the 1947 ACS conference and the possible breakthrough was widely published in newspapers. The topic was of wide interest because valvular disease affected so many people at the time. Tuberculosis killed the most people under 50 in the 1940s, but because of the prevalence of rheumatic fever, narrowing of the mitral valve was the next most common cause of death in this age group. Although the original valvulotome had allowed him to start working on aortic valves, he knew that he needed a more sophisticated device to contend with scar tissue found in the mitral valve. In conjunction with C. D. Coleman, who ran the university's machine shop, he developed a new valvulotome. The device consisted of a plunger inside a hollow tube and a set of jaws. As the plunger was depressed, the jaws closed. The jaws would \\"bite\\" out a small portion of the narrowed valve. Betty Lee Woolridge In early 1948, Smithy prepared to perform his first heart valve surgery on a human. Although two surgeons had attempted mitral valve surgery on several patients in the 1920s, most of those patients had died and mitral valve repair had not been attempted since then. Smithy's first patient, a 21-year-old woman named Betty Lee Woolridge, had sustained heart valve damage from rheumatic fever at the age of ten. Woolridge explained that she had been in heart failure for two years, that diuretics and dietary modifications were no longer effective, and that she hoped Smithy would operate on her heart. It appears that Smithy declined Woolridge's initial request for surgical help, but she sent a second letter, asking him why he would continue to experiment on animals when he had a willing human patient. Smithy agreed to have Woolridge come to Charleston for surgery. When she arrived, Woolridge weighed 85 pounds, could not breathe while lying flat, and appeared so frail that Smithy nearly refused to operate on her. Heart failure was causing fluid accumulation in the abdomen; the day before her heart surgery, Smithy drained six liters of fluid off of her abdomen. Heart surgery on Woolridge commenced on January 30, 1948. After Smithy opened Woolridge's chest, he placed a purse-string suture around the heart so that the heart tissue could be pulled tight to compress the heart muscle around the valvulotome to minimize bleeding. He also injected novocaine into the heart to lessen the risk of arrhythmias. The valvulotome was inserted through a small hole made in the heart. The device was advanced to Woolridge's mitral valve by feel and then used to cut away scar tissue in the valve. Woolridge seemed to recover well. On February 9, Smithy introduced Woolridge at a medical meeting being held in Charleston and she was said to be \\"up, walking and apparently nearly well.\\" By February 15, Woolridge had returned to her home in Canton, Ohio. Smithy told reporters that he hoped to perform the same surgery on other patients soon, but that definite results of the surgery could not be determined for at least five years. After Smithy operated on Woolridge, the South Carolina General Assembly issued a resolution in his honor. A couple of weeks later, Woolridge appeared on a radio program to discuss her recovery; illness prevented Smithy from appearing. By the time of the radio broadcast, Smithy had carried out a second valve surgery; the patient had died. He performed valvulotomies on seven patients by the summer of 1948. Operating with Alfred Blalock As Smithy began to perform valvulotomies on humans, he knew that his own heart disease was worsening and that a valvulotomy might be his only hope as a patient. He began corresponding with famed cardiac surgeon Alfred Blalock of Johns Hopkins Hospital, who he thought he could convince to perform the novel procedure. Smithy knew that he would need to demonstrate the procedure's feasibility to Blalock. In their communications, Blalock must have asked for one of Smithy's valvulotomes, as a March 1948 letter from Smithy's secretary indicates that Coleman was about to send one to him. John Boone, chief of medicine at the Medical College of South Carolina, wrote to Blalock on Smithy's behalf in May 1948. Blalock wrote back within days, asking Smithy to arrange a trip to Johns Hopkins where they could locate a patient and operate together. \\"Nothing would give me greater pleasure than being able to help you by the use of your method,\\" Blalock wrote. In late June, Smithy sent Blalock a letter indicating that he had a young man from New York whose aortic stenosis was nearly identical to Smithy's. He wrote that the patient was willing to travel to Baltimore for surgery. Smithy came to Baltimore and did laboratory work with technician Vivien Thomas and resident Denton Cooley. When Smithy and Blalock operated on their first patient, a very sick man between the ages of 35 and 40, things did not go as they had hoped. The events have been described with slight variations, but it seems that the patient developed a fatal arrhythmia while being anesthetized or while the chest incision was being made. Cooley said that he saw Smithy's face drop noticeably when the patient died, perhaps because he saw Blalock as his only chance at having the surgery himself. The patient's death dissuaded Blalock from further involvement in the procedure that Smithy proposed. Death In early October 1948, Smithy developed pneumonia and was admitted to Roper Hospital; his condition was further compromised by cardiac asthma and another bout of rheumatic fever. He was scheduled to present a paper at a conference of the American College of Chest Physicians that month. The accounts of Smithy's nurse, Agnes Bowen Kleckley, and an associate, J. M. Stallworth, differ; Smithy either dictated the last few pages of the paper to Stallworth or discussed the remaining portions of the paper with Stallworth for him to finish. In any case, a conference presentation was given by Stallworth and a paper on the surgical treatment of valvular disease was later published in Surgery, Obstetrics & Gynecology. On October 22, The New York Times reported that complications had ensued and that Smithy was in critical condition. On October 28, Smithy died; he had never been able to undergo surgery on his own aortic valve. An autopsy later showed that the opening in Smithy's aortic valve was smaller than \\"the point of a knitting needle.\\" More than 300 people came to Smithy's funeral at St. Michael's Episcopal Church in Charleston. Fourteen of his colleagues served as honorary pallbearers. Woolridge died ten days after Smithy did. Though she died at home, she had been in the hospital frequently after returning to Canton, and she spent two months in the hospital shortly before she died. Four of Smithy's seven valvulotomy patients were still alive and doing well at the time of Woolridge's death. Smithy was posthumously named an \\"outstanding young man of 1948\\" by the South Carolina chapter of the Junior Chamber of Commerce. After Smithy died, Blalock exchanged letters with Smithy's widow. Blalock said that he had recently been in Berryville, Virginia, and that he had gone with his wife to the cemetery where Smithy was buried. Legacy Ultimately, most of Smithy's success with valvulotomy was short-lived and his procedure was soon replaced with more effective interventions. However, Smithy's intracardiac injection of novocaine significantly decreased the likelihood of arrhythmias that could occur when the heart was surgically manipulated. A Medical University of South Carolina library exhibit says that \\"[b]etter operations than Smithy's were already accomplished, and their value would become apparent. In going the wrong way, Smithy nonetheless achieved positive results and invited comparisons that eventually led to the realization that commissurotomy was the operation of choice... his work, well publicized at the time, encouraged patients and physicians and prompted the concept that operative treatment of valvular heart disease could be successful.\\" Heart surgeon Charles P. Bailey, who was working on heart valve surgery at a different institution at the same time as Smithy, later commented on Smithy's personality. He said that though surgeons tended to be egotistical, Smithy was \\"not only a southern gentleman, but a true gentleman.\\" Bailey recalled a meeting at which he presented some patient data and Smithy was asked to comment on it. Though Smithy had a better success rate on the procedure with a larger number of patients, Smithy did not mention that. Instead, he complimented Bailey on his unique method of opening the mitral valve. Smithy's family left money to the Medical University of South Carolina after he died. The money built up over time, and after a local surgeon added to the fund, the university created the Horace G. Smithy Chair of Cardiothoracic Surgery in 1997. MUSC hosts the Horace G. Smithy Lecture annually.

Her sister Jeanne Chapelle was a successful trainer at Oxford Stadium with the JC prefix in the 1960s.  Career  Linda started as a kennel girl at Wembley and then as a trainer initially raced out of Cambridge Stadium in 1982 before spells at Harringay Stadium and Crayford Stadium. The first Classic race success arrived in 1984 by virtue of a Laurels title with a greyhound called Amenhotep. Linda continued to gain success and switched tracks to Romford Stadium in 1987. She secured the first of three Grand National titles in 1990 and her son David took out a licence at Sunderland in 1991 before Linda gained a contract at Walthamstow Stadium. She secured five consecutive Champion Trainer titles from 1996-2000. A first English Greyhound Derby final appearance in 1995 was quickly followed by numerous classics with the help of greyhounds such as El Tenor and Palace Issue. In 1999 Linda's Hello Buttons dead heated with Pottos Storm trained by her son David. In 2000, Linda called it a day and retired, her son John took over the licence. Awards She won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year for five consecutive in 1996-2000 and won the Trainers Championship three times in 1991, 1993 and 1997.

Formed in 1960 from the Baltic Air Defense Corps, the corps provided air defense for the Latvian and Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republics. In the early 1970s it took over responsibility for Kaliningrad Oblast as well. Initially part of the 2nd Independent Air Defense Army, it was subordinated to the Air Forces of the Baltic Military District from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. In 1986 the corps became part of the 6th Independent Air Defense Army, and was disbanded in 1994 after the Russian withdrawal from the Baltics following the end of the Cold War and the Dissolution of the Soviet Union.  History  In the summer of 1954, the air defense units in the Baltic states became part of the new Baltic Air Defense Corps of the Soviet Air Defense Forces, headquartered in Riga. In early 1957, the Baltic Air Defense Corps and the Air Defense Directorate of the Baltic Fleet were merged to form the Separate Baltic Air Defense Corps, which also included the 14th Air Defense Division at Tallinn. During the Air Defense Forces reorganization in the spring and summer of 1960, the corps became the 27th Air Defense Corps, part of the 2nd Independent Air Defense Army at Minsk, still with headquarters in Riga. The 27th Corps controlled air defense on the territory of the Latvian and Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republics. It included two interceptor regiments: the 54th Guards at Vai≈Üode and the 372nd at Daugavpils. The 158th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade was formed in 1961 at LiepƒÅja with the corps. In 1967 and 1968, the 205th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade was formed from a regiment of the corps at Riga. The 77th Anti- Aircraft Rocket Brigade was formed around the same time from a regiment at Ventspils. The 85th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade was formed at Kaunas around the same time. In 1973 it took over responsibility for Kaliningrad Oblast when the 3rd Air Defense Division was disbanded with its units directly subordinated to the headquarters of the 27th Corps. The corps gained the 689th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment at Nivenskoye, the 169th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade at Neman, the 69th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade at Baltiysk, the 183rd Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade at Gvardeysk, and the 298th Radio- Technical Regiment at Zelenogradsk. In August 1974, the 298th became the 81st Radio-Technical Brigade, before relocating to Pereslavlskoye in 1977. In 1975, two radio-technical regiments from the corps merged to form the 80th Radio- Technical Brigade at Tukums. Between 1978 and 1985, the corps was subordinated to the Baltic Military District. At the same time, its fighter aviation regiments were transferred to the Air Forces of the district. In early 1986, it became part of the 6th Independent Air Defense Army. At this time, the corps included two interceptor regiments: the 54th Guards with 38 Su-27s, and the 689th Guards with 36 Su-27s, as well as seven surface-to-air missile brigades: the 69th, 77th, 85th, 158th Guards, 169th, 183rd Guards and 205th, and two radio-technical brigades operating radar for the corps: the 80th and 81st. In 1987, the 85th Brigade was disbanded with its personnel transferred to the 466th Brigade. The latter had been recently formed at Vilnius from a regiment. The 85th was replaced by the mobilization 427th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment, whose headquarters was formed in Leningrad Oblast with the 6th Independent Air Defense Army.

In the fall of 1990, the 54th Guards was disbanded with its lineage transferred to the 594th Training Fighter Aviation Regiment. The 77th Brigade disbanded in December 1992, and the 205th Brigade disbanded in 1993. In early 1993, the equipment and personnel of the 158th Brigade were withdrawn to Leningrad Oblast, where they merged with the 82nd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade to form the 500th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment. Around the same time, the 466th Brigade and its S-300 missiles were withdrawn to Smolensk Oblast, where they inherited the lineage of the disbanded 493rd Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment to become the 284th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment. In 1994, the corps headquarters was disbanded. On 26 July of that year, the 689th Guards transferred to the Air and Air Defense Forces of the Baltic Fleet.

Based on a cartouche inscription, it probably dates back to the reign of Thutmose I of the Eighteenth Dynasty. The owner Who built this tomb is not yet clear. It may have been occupied by a scribe named Maati and his wife Mehu, according to funerary cones found in its courtyard, This is highly unlikely since his cones are securely dated to the reign of Thutmosis III.. Another possibility is a person named Djehutymes, whose name was found on one of its walls. He may have been the owner or a relative. History of archaeological work The tomb is known since at least the 1990s and was registered as \\"Kampp 150\\" by Friederike Kampp-Seyfried during her survey in the years 1988/89. She gave a first account on the architecture and decoration of this funerary complex: It is a saff-tomb with an open courtyard and a four- pillared portikus, now mostly destroyed, a broad hall with a caved-in ceiling, and a long corridor, leading to the shaft room with a small niche in the middle of the back wall which was used as a chapel. A shaft is located in the northern half of this room. F. Kampp-Seyfried dated the tomb to the end of the 17th or beginning of the 18th Dynasty based on the architectural remains.F.

On December 9, 2017, the Ministry of State of Antiquities announced that the tomb was cleared from debris, along with Kampp 161, by a team of Egyptian archeologists. Finds A yet unidentified linen-wrapped mummy was found inside, along with funerary objects, like wooden statues and masks. References Bibliography F. Kampp, Die thebanische Nekropole.

Biography Orlando received in 1903 his laurea from the University of Messina, where he was a student of Bagnera and Marcolongo. After a year of graduate study at the University of Pisa, he became an assistant and libero docente at the University of Messina. After the 1908 Messina earthquake, he moved to Rome, where he taught at the Istituto superiore di Magistero and at the Aeronautical School of Engineering of the Sapienza University of Rome. He took part in some university competitions but was unsuccessful and when, in 1915, he went into military action, some of his friends warned him that they thought his courage might quickly lead to his death. He died as Captain of Military Engineers, leading an action of his company of demolition specialists against the bridge of St. Daniel near Tolmin. (Half of the entire Italian WW I casualties occurred in the Battles of the Isonzo.) He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1908 in Rome.Orlando (Rome): Sulla risoluzione delle equazioni integrali.\\"The author showed a method of solving integral equations with a polynomial nucleus and by means of the method of successive approximations passed to the general case. He also considered equations which contain the derivative of the unknown function.\\" from p. 14 of: Orlando's most important publications deal with mathematical physics, especially the theory of elasticity and the theory of integral equations. He was one of the first to recognize the importance of Pincherle-Goursat kernels, which are an important special case of Fredholm kernels. Also noteworthy is some of Orlando's algebraic research, inspired by his teacher Bagnera.
