The highway is just over long and runs from U.S. Route 16A (US 16A) in Keystone to Bureau of Indian Affairs Highway 41 in Red Shirt. The highway runs near Mount Rushmore National Memorial in Keystone, and its eastern terminus is on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation near the edge of Badlands National Park. History SD 40 was first established along the route from Rapid City to the Minnesota border southeast of Sioux Falls in 1926. The section east of near Philip was cosigned with US 16 when the U.S. Highway System was created. The SD 40 designation was dropped from the section east of Philip in 1927. SD 40 was rerouted southeast to east of Witten, replacing the part of SD 44\\\\. SD 40 became part of an extended SD 44 by 1975. SD 40 was established along its current route in 1976. Route description Custer County, east of Hermosa, August 2010 SD 40 begins at an intersection with US 16A in Keystone and heads east through the town. It crosses Battle Creek numerous times, then leaves Keystone and heads in a general southeastern direction, curving regularly. The highway crosses Iron Creek just before leaving the Black Hills National Forest and crossing Battle Creek once more. It continues southeast, leaving Pennington County and entering Custer County. In Custer County, SD 40 meets SD 79, and the two highways run northward toward Hermosa. They straddle the western limit of Hermosa for a short distance before SD 79 continues north and SD 40 splits off to the east, passing through Hermosa. East of town, SD 40 curves back to the southeast and enters the Buffalo Gap National Grassland. Finally, the route curves to the south and crosses the Cheyenne River; doing this, it leaves the Buffalo Gap National Grassland and Custer County, and enters Oglala Lakota County and the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, becoming Bureau of Indian Affairs Highway 41 (BIA Hwy. 41). Legal definition The route of SD 40 is defined in South Dakota Codified Laws ¬ß 31-4-161. Major intersections Related route South Dakota Highway 40A was a short spur route in the east part of Badlands National Park. This route was originally part of South Dakota Highway 40. At that time, SD 40 exited the park to the northeast, and continued east with U.S. Highway 16. Around 1970, SD 40 was rerouted south from the park to a new alignment south of the White River. When this was done, SD 40A was created to link with Alternate U.S. Highway 16. In 1976, this route was redesignated as South Dakota Highway 377.

Mithridates is remembered as one of the Roman Republic‚Äôs most formidable and successful enemies, who engaged three of the prominent generals from the late Roman Republic in the Mithridatic Wars: Sulla, Lucullus and Pompey. He has been called the greatest ruler of the Kingdom of Pontus.  Etymology  Mithridates is the Greek attestation of the Persian name MihrdƒÅt, meaning \\"given by Mithra\\", the name of the ancient Iranian sun god. The name itself is derived from Old Iranian MiŒ∏ra-dƒÅta-. Ancestry, family and early life Map of the Kingdom of Pontus, Before the reign of Mithridates VI (dark purple), after his conquests (purple), his conquests in the first Mithridatic wars (pink) and Pontus' ally the Kingdom of Armenia (green). Mithridates VI was a prince of Persian and Greek ancestry. He claimed descent from Cyrus the Great, the family of Darius the Great, the Regent Antipater, the generals of Alexander the Great as well as the later kings Antigonus I Monophthalmus and Seleucus I Nicator. Mithridates was born in the Pontic city of Sinope, and was raised in the Kingdom of Pontus. He was the first son among the children born to Laodice VI and Mithridates V of Pontus (reigned 150‚Äì120 BC). His father, Mithridates V, was a prince and the son of the former Pontic monarchs Pharnaces I of Pontus and his wife-cousin Nysa. His mother, Laodice VI, was a Seleucid princess and the daughter of the Seleucid monarchs Antiochus IV Epiphanes and his wife-sister Laodice IV. Mithridates V was assassinated in about 120 BC in Sinope, poisoned by unknown persons at a lavish banquet which he held.Mayor, p. 68 He left the kingdom to the joint rule of Mithridates' mother, Laodice VI, Mithridates, and his younger brother, Mithridates Chrestus. Neither Mithridates nor his younger brother were of age, and their mother retained all power as regent for the time being.Mayor, p. 69 Laodice VI's regency over Pontus was from 120 BC to 116 BC (even perhaps up to 113 BC) and favored Mithridates Chrestus over Mithridates. During his mother's regency, he escaped from his mother's plots against him, and went into hiding. Mithridates emerged from hiding, returning to Pontus between 116 BC and 113 BC and was hailed as king. By this time he had grown to become a man of considerable stature and physical strength. He could combine extraordinary energy and determination with a considerable talent for politics, organization and strategy. Mithridates removed his mother and brother from the throne, imprisoning both, becoming the sole ruler of Pontus.Mayor, p. 394 Laodice VI died in prison, ostensibly of natural causes. Mithridates Chrestus may have died in prison also, or may have been tried for treason and executed. Mithridates gave both royal funerals.Mayor, p. 100 Mithridates first married his younger sister Laodice, aged 16.Getzel, Hellenistic settlements in Europe, the islands, and Asia Minor p.387 His goal was to preserve the purity of their bloodline, solidify his claim to the throne, to co-rule over Pontus, and to ensure the succession to his legitimate children. Early reign Mithridates entertained ambitions of making his state the dominant power in the Black Sea and Anatolia. He first subjugated Colchis, a region east of the Black Sea, and prior to 164 BC, an independent kingdom. He then clashed for supremacy on the Pontic steppe with the Scythian King Palacus. The most important centres of Crimea, Tauric Chersonesus and the Bosporan Kingdom readily surrendered their independence in return for Mithridates' promises to protect them against the Scythians, their ancient enemies. After several abortive attempts to invade the Crimea, the Scythians and the allied Rhoxolanoi suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Pontic general Diophantus and accepted Mithridates as their overlord. The young king then turned his attention to Anatolia, where Roman power was on the rise. He contrived to partition Paphlagonia and Galatia with King Nicomedes III of Bithynia. It was probably on the occasion of the Paphlagonian invasion of 108 BC that Mithridates adopted the Bithynian era for use on his coins in honour of the alliance. This calendar era began with the first Bithynian king Zipoites I in 297 BC. It was certainly in use in Pontus by 96 BC at the latest.Jakob Munk H√∏jte, \\"From Kingdom to Province: Reshaping Pontos after the Fall of Mithridates VI\\", in T√∏nnes Bekker-Nielsen (ed.), Rome and the Black Sea Region: Domination, Romanisation, Resistance (Aarhus University Press, 2006), 15‚Äì30. Yet it soon became clear to Mithridates that Nicomedes was steering his country into an anti-Pontic alliance with the expanding Roman Republic. When Mithridates fell out with Nicomedes over control of Cappadocia, and defeated him in a series of battles, the latter was constrained to openly enlist the assistance of Rome. The Romans twice interfered in the conflict on behalf of Nicomedes (95‚Äì92 BC), leaving Mithridates, should he wish to continue the expansion of his kingdom, with little choice other than to engage in a future Roman-Pontic war. By this time Mithridates had resolved to expel the Romans from Asia. Mithridatic Wars Mithridatic Wars 87‚Äì86 BC. The next ruler of Bithynia, Nicomedes IV of Bithynia, was a figurehead manipulated by the Romans. Mithridates plotted to overthrow him, but his attempts failed and Nicomedes IV, instigated by his Roman advisors, declared war on Pontus. Rome itself was involved in the Social War, a civil war with its Italian allies. Thus, in all of Roman Asia Province there were only two legions present in Macedonia. These legions combined with Nicomedes IV's army to invade Mithridates' kingdom of Pontus in 89 BC. Mithridates won a decisive victory, scattering the Roman-led forces. His victorious forces were welcomed throughout Anatolia. The following year, 88 BC, Mithridates orchestrated a massacre of Roman and Italian settlers remaining in several Anatolian cities, essentially wiping out the Roman presence in the region. 80,000 people are said to have perished in this massacre. The episode is known as the Asiatic Vespers.Mayor The Kingdom of Pontus comprised a mixed population in its Ionian Greek and Anatolian cities. The royal family moved the capital from Amasya to the Greek city of Sinope. Its rulers tried to fully assimilate the potential of their subjects by showing a Greek face to the Greek world and an Iranian/Anatolian face to the Eastern world. Whenever the gap between the rulers and their Anatolian subjects became greater, they would put emphasis on their Persian origins. In this manner, the royal propaganda claimed heritage both from Persian and Greek rulers, including Cyrus the Great, Darius I of Persia, Alexander the Great and Seleucus I Nicator.McGing, p. 11 Mithridates too posed as the champion of Hellenism, but this was mainly to further his political ambitions; it is no proof that he felt a mission to promote its extension within his domains. Whatever his true intentions, the Greek cities (including Athens) defected to the side of Mithridates and welcomed his armies in mainland Greece, while his fleet besieged the Romans at Rhodes. Neighboring King of Armenia Tigranes the Great established an alliance with Mithridates and married one of Mithridates‚Äô daughters, Cleopatra of Pontus. They would support each other in the coming conflict with Rome. The Romans responded by organising a large invasion force to defeat him and remove him from power. The First Mithridatic War, fought between 88 BC and 84 BC, saw Lucius Cornelius Sulla force Mithridates VI out of Greece proper. After victory in several battles, Sulla received news of trouble back in Rome posed by his enemy Gaius Marius and hurriedly concluded peace talks with Mithridates. As Sulla returned to Italy Lucius Licinius Murena was left in charge of Roman forces in Anatolia. The lenient peace treaty, which was never ratified by the Senate, allowed Mithridates VI to restore his forces. Murena attacked Mithridates in 83 BC, provoking the Second Mithridatic War from 83 BC to 81 BC. Mithridates defeated Murena's two green legions at the Battle of Halys in 82 BC before peace was again declared by treaty. When Rome attempted to annex Bithynia (bequested to Rome by its last king) nearly a decade later, Mithridates VI attacked with an even larger army, leading to the Third Mithridatic War from 73 BC to 63 BC. Lucullus was sent against Mithridates and the Romans routed the Pontic forces at the Battle of Cabira in 72 BC, driving Mithridates to exile into King Tigranes' Armenia. While Lucullus was preoccupied fighting the Armenians, Mithridates surged back to retake his kingdom of Pontus by crushing four Roman legions under Valerius Triarius and killing 7,000 Roman soldiers at the Battle of Zela in 67 BC. He was routed by Pompey's legions at the Battle of the Lycus in 66 BC. After this defeat, Mithridates VI fled with a small army to Colchis (modern Georgia) and then over the Caucasus Mountains to Crimea and made plans to raise yet another army to take on the Romans. His eldest living son, Machares, viceroy of Cimmerian Bosporus, was unwilling to aid his father. Mithridates had Machares killed, and Mithridates took the throne of the Bosporan Kingdom. Mithridates then ordered conscription and preparations for war. In 63 BC, Pharnaces II of Pontus, one of his sons, led a rebellion against his father, joined by Roman exiles in the core of Mithridates' Pontic army. Mithridates withdrew to the citadel in Panticapaeum, where he committed suicide. Pompey buried Mithridates in the rock-cut tombs of his ancestors in Amasya, the old capital of Pontus. Assassination conspiracy During the time of the First Mithridatic War, a group of Mithridates' friends plotted to kill him. These were Mynnio and Philotimus of Smyrna, and Cleisthenes and Asclepiodotus of Lesbos. Asclepiodotus changed his mind and became an informant. He arranged to have Mithridates hide under a couch to hear the plot against him. The other conspirators were tortured and executed. Mithridates also killed all of the plotters' families and friends. Representation of power A coin depicting Mithridates VI Where his ancestors pursued philhellenism as a means of attaining respectability and prestige among the Hellenistic kingdoms, Mithridates VI made use of Hellenism as a political tool. Both Greeks, Romans and Asians were welcome at his court. As protector of Greek cities on the Black Sea and in Asia against barbarism, Mithridates VI logically became protector of Greece and Greek culture, and used this stance in his clashes with Rome.McGing, p. 64 Strabo mentions that Chersonesus buckled under the pressure of the barbarians and asked Mithridates VI to become its protector (7.4.3. c.308). The most impressive symbol of Mithridates VI's approbation with Greece (Athens in particular) appears at Delos: a heroon dedicated to the Pontic king in 102/1 by the Athenian Helianax, a priest of Poseidon Aisios.McGing, p. 90 A dedication at Delos, by Dicaeus, a priest of Sarapis, was made in 94/93 BC on behalf of the Athenians, Romans, and \\"King Mithridates Eupator Dionysus\\".McGing, pp. 91‚Äì92 Greek styles mixed with Persian elements also abound on official Pontic coins ‚Äì Perseus was favored as an intermediary between both worlds, East and West.McGing, pp. 93‚Äì102 Certainly influenced by Alexander the Great, Mithridates VI extended his propaganda from \\"defender\\" of Greece to the \\"great liberator\\" of the Greek world as war with the Roman Republic became inevitable. The Romans were easily translated into \\"barbarians\\", in the same sense as the Persian Empire during the war with Persia in the first half of the 5th century BC and during Alexander's campaign. How many Greeks genuinely bought into this claim will never be known. It served its purpose; at least partially because of it, Mithridates VI was able to fight the First War with Rome on Greek soil, and maintain the allegiance of Greece.McGing, pp. 125‚Äì126 His campaign for the allegiance of the Greeks was aided in no small part by his enemy Sulla, who allowed his troops to sack the city of Delphi and plunder many of the city's most famous treasures to help finance his military expenses. Death After Pompey defeated him in Pontus, Mithridates VI fled to the lands north of the Black Sea in the winter of 66 BC in the hope that he could raise a new army and carry on the war through invading Italy by way of the Danube. His preparations proved to be too harsh on the local nobles and populace, and they rebelled against his rule. He reportedly attempted suicide by poison. This attempt failed because of his immunity to the poison.A History of Rome, LeGlay, et al. 100 According to Appian's Roman History, he then requested his Gallic bodyguard and friend, Bituitus, to kill him by the sword: Cassius Dio's Roman History records a different account: At the behest of Pompey, Mithridates' body was later buried alongside his ancestors (in either Sinope or Amaseia). Mount Mithridat in the central Kerch and the town of Yevpatoria in Crimea commemorate his name. Mithridates' antidote De Medicina In his youth, after the assassination of his father Mithridates V in 120 BC, Mithridates is said to have lived in the wilderness for seven years, inuring himself to hardship. While there, and after his accession, he cultivated an immunity to poisons by regularly ingesting sub-lethal doses of the same.McGing, p. 43 He invented a complex \\"universal antidote\\" against poisoning; several versions are described in the literature. Aulus Cornelius Celsus gives one in his De Medicina and names it Antidotum Mithridaticum, whence English mithridate.Celsus, De Medicina, Book V, 23.3. (Loeb, 1935) Pliny the Elder's version comprised 54 ingredients to be placed in a flask and matured for at least two months. After Mithridates' death in 63 BC, many imperial Roman physicians claimed to possess and improve on the original formula, which they touted as Mithradatium. In keeping with most medical practices of his era, Mithridates' anti-poison routines included a religious component; they were supervised by the Agari, a group of Scythian shamans who never left him. Mithridates was reportedly guarded in his sleep by a horse, a bull, and a stag, which would whinny, bellow, and bleat whenever anyone approached the royal bed.Mayor, Adrienne. Greek Fire, Poison Arrows, and Scorpion Bombs: Biological and Chemical Warfare in the Ancient World. New York, Overlook Duckworth, 2003; p. 148 Mithridates as polyglot In Pliny the Elder's account of famous polyglots, Mithridates could speak the languages of all the twenty-two nations he governed.\\"Mithridates, who was king of twenty-two nations, administered their laws in as many languages, and could harangue each of them, without employing an interpreter:\\" Pliny the Elder, Natural History, VII, 24. This reputation led to the use of Mithridates' name as title in some later works on comparative linguistics, such as Conrad Gessner's Mithridates de differentis linguis (1555), and Adelung and Vater's Mithridates oder allgemeine Sprachenkunde (1806‚Äì1817).Johann Christoph Adelung & Johann Severin Vater, Mithridates, oder allgemeine Sprachenkunde mit dem Vater Unser als Sprachprobe in bey nahe f√ºnf hundert Sprachen und Mundarten, Mithridites was also fluent in the ancient language of the Persians and would practice it on any Persian prisoners he had not yet killed or tortured.1806‚Äì1817, Berlin, Vossische Buchlandlung, 4 volumes. Facsimile edition, Hildesheim-Nueva York, , 1970. Wives, mistresses and children Mithridates VI had wives and mistresses, by whom he had several children. The names he gave his children are a representation of his Persian and Greek heritage and ancestry. His first wife was his sister Laodice. They were married from 115/113 BC until about 90 BC. They had several children. Their sons were Mithridates, Arcathius, Machares and Pharnaces II of Pontus. Their daughters were Cleopatra of Pontus (sometimes called Cleopatra the Elder to distinguish her from her sister of the same name) and Drypetina (a diminutive form of \\"Drypetis\\"). Drypetina was Mithridates VI's most devoted daughter. Her baby teeth never fell out, so she had a double set of teeth. His second wife was a Greek Macedonian Noblewoman, Monime. They were married from about 89/88 BC until 72/71 BC and had a daughter, Athenais, who married King Ariobarzanes II of Cappadocia. His next two wives were also Greek: he was married to his third wife Berenice of Chios, from 86‚Äì72/71 BC, and to his fourth wife Stratonice of Pontus, from sometime after 86 to 63 BC. Stratonice bore Mithridates a son Xiphares. His fifth wife is unknown. His sixth wife Hypsicratea, famed for her loyalty and prowess in battle, was Caucasian, and they were married from an unknown date to 63 BC. One of his mistresses was the Galatian Celtic Princess Adobogiona the Elder. By Adobogiona, Mithridates had two children: a son called Mithridates I of the Bosporus and a daughter called Adobogiona the Younger. His sons born from his concubines were Cyrus, Xerxes, Darius, Ariarathes IX of Cappadocia, Artaphernes, Oxathres, Phoenix (Mithridates‚Äô son by a mistress of Syrian descent), and Exipodras, named after kings of the Persian Empire, which he claimed ancestry from. His daughters born from his concubines were Nysa, Eupatra, Cleopatra the Younger, Mithridatis and Orsabaris. Nysa and Mithridates, were engaged to the Egyptian Greek Pharaohs Ptolemy XII Auletes and his brother Ptolemy of Cyprus. In 63 BC, when the Kingdom of Pontus was annexed by the Roman general Pompey, the remaining sisters, wives, mistresses, and children of Mithridates VI in Pontus were put to death. Plutarch, writing in his Lives (Pompey, v.45), states that Mithridates' sister and five of his children took part in Pompey's triumphal procession on his return to Rome in 61 BC. The Cappadocian Greek nobleman and high priest of the temple-state of Comana, Cappadocia, Archelaus was descended from Mithridates VI. He claimed to be a son of Mithridates VI;Strabo 17.1.11 but the chronology suggests that Archelaus may actually have been a maternal grandson of the Pontic king, and the son of Mithridates VI's favorite general, who may have married one of the daughters of Mithridates VI.Mayor, p. 114 Culture *The demise of Mithridates VI is detailed in the 1673 play Mithridate written by Jean Racine. This play is the basis for several 18th century operas including one of Mozart's earliest, known most commonly by its Italian name, Mitridate, re di Ponto (1770). *Mithridates is the subject of the opera Mitridate Eupatore (1707) by Alessandro Scarlatti. *Ralph Waldo Emerson included his \\"Mithridates\\" in his 1847 Poems. *Alexandre Dumas's novel The Count of Monte Cristo refers to the potential of a mithridate as an instrument both of defense and offence. *William Wordsworth, amidst casting about for poetic themes in The Prelude (Bk i vv 186 ff): *James Joyce alludes to Mithridates' immunity to poison in his love poem Though I Thy Mithridates Were. *The poet A. E. Housman alludes to Mithridates' antidote in the final stanza of \\"Terence, This Is Stupid Stuff\\" in A Shropshire Lad: *Dorothy L. Sayers' detective novel Strong Poison, from 1929, has the protagonist, Lord Peter Wimsey, solve a case of murder by arsenic poisoning, and quotes the last line from Housman's poem. *In The Grass Crown, the second in the Masters of Rome series, Colleen McCullough describes in detail the various aspects of his life ‚Äì the murder of Laodice, and the Roman Consul who, quite alone and surrounded by the Pontic army, ordered Mithridates to leave Cappadocia immediately and go back to Pontus ‚Äì which he did. *The Last King is an historical novel by Michael Curtis Ford about the King and his exploits against the Roman Republic. *Mithridates is a major character in Poul Anderson's novel The Golden Slave. *In the novel Mithridates is Dead (Spanish: Mitr√≠dates ha muerto), Ignasi Rib√≥ traces parallels between the historical figures of Mithridates and Osama Bin Laden. Within a postmodern narrative of the making and unmaking of history, Rib√≥ suggests that the September 11 attacks on the United States closely paralleled the massacre of Roman citizens in 88 B.C. and prompted similar consequences, namely the imperialist overstretch of the American and Roman republics respectively. Furthermore, he suggests that the ensuing Mithridatic Wars were one of the key factors in the demise of Rome's republican regime, as well as in the spread of the Christian faith in Asia Minor and eventually throughout the whole Roman Empire. The novel implies that the current events in the world might have similar unforeseen consequences. *In The King's Gambit, the first volume of the SPQR series by John Maddox Roberts, the protagonist, Decius Metellus, becomes aware of a plot between Pompey and Crassus to relieve Lucullus of command and allow Pompey to lead the final campaign against Mithradates. At the time of this novel, Decius reflects that Mithradates has successfully resisted Roman military campaigns for so long that the public has built him up as some kind of superhuman bogeyman. *Mithridates and his wife Monime are characters in Steven Saylor's 2015 novel Wrath of the Furies.

A central question in evolution is how simple protocells first arose and how they could differ in reproductive output, thus enabling the accumulation of novel biological emergences over time, i.e. biological evolution. Although a functional protocell has not yet been achieved in a laboratory setting, the goal to understand the process appears well within reach. Overview Compartmentalization was important in the origins of life. Membranes form enclosed compartments that are separate from the external environment, thus providing the cell with functionally specialized aqueous spaces. As the lipid bilayer of membranes is impermeable to most hydrophilic molecules (dissolved by water), cells have membrane transport-systems that achieve the import of nutritive molecules as well as the export of waste. It is very challenging to construct protocells from molecular assemblies. An important step in this challenge is the achievement of vesicle dynamics that are relevant to cellular functions, such as membrane trafficking and self- reproduction, using amphiphilic molecules. On the primitive Earth, numerous chemical reactions of organic compounds produced the ingredients of life. Of these substances, amphiphilic molecules might be the first player in the evolution from molecular assembly to cellular life. A step from vesicle toward protocell might be to develop self-reproducing vesicles coupled with the metabolic system. Selectivity for compartmentalization The three main structures phospholipids form in solution; the liposome (a closed bilayer), the micelle and the bilayer. Self-assembled vesicles are essential components of primitive cells. The second law of thermodynamics requires that the universe move in a direction in which disorder (or entropy) increases, yet life is distinguished by its great degree of organization. Therefore, a boundary is needed to separate life processes from non-living matter. The cell membrane is the only cellular structure that is found in all of the cells of all of the organisms on Earth. Researchers Irene A. Chen and Jack W. Szostak (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2009) amongst others, demonstrated that simple physicochemical properties of elementary protocells can give rise to simpler conceptual analogues of essential cellular behaviors, including primitive forms of Darwinian competition and energy storage. Such cooperative interactions between the membrane and encapsulated contents could greatly simplify the transition from replicating molecules to true cells. Competition for membrane molecules would favor stabilized membranes, suggesting a selective advantage for the evolution of cross-linked fatty acids and even the phospholipids of today. This micro-encapsulation allowed for metabolism within the membrane, exchange of small molecules and prevention of passage of large substances across it. The main advantages of encapsulation include increased solubility of the cargo and creating energy in the form of chemical gradient. Energy is thus often said to be stored by cells in the structures of molecules of substances such as carbohydrates (including sugars), lipids, and proteins, which release energy when chemically combined with oxygen during cellular respiration. Energy gradient A March 2014 study by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory demonstrated a unique way to study the origins of life: fuel cells. Fuel cells are similar to biological cells in that electrons are also transferred to and from molecules. In both cases, this results in electricity and power. The study states that one important factor was that the Earth provides electrical energy at the seafloor. \\"This energy could have kick- started life and could have sustained life after it arose. Now, we have a way of testing different materials and environments that could have helped life arise not just on Earth, but possibly on Mars, Europa and other places in the Solar System.\\" Vesicles, micelles and membraneless droplets Scheme of a micelle spontaneously formed by phospholipids in an aqueous solution When phospholipids are placed in water, the molecules spontaneously arrange such that the tails are shielded from the water, resulting in the formation of membrane structures such as bilayers, vesicles, and micelles. In modern cells, vesicles are involved in metabolism, transport, buoyancy control, and enzyme storage. They can also act as natural chemical reaction chambers. A typical vesicle or micelle in aqueous solution forms an aggregate with the hydrophilic \\"head\\" regions in contact with surrounding solvent, sequestering the hydrophobic single-tail regions in the micelle centre. This phase is caused by the packing behavior of single-tail lipids in a bilayer. Although the protocellular self-assembly process that spontaneously form lipid monolayer vesicles and micelles in nature resemble the kinds of primordial vesicles or protocells that might have existed at the beginning of evolution, they are not as sophisticated as the bilayer membranes of today's living organisms. Rather than being made up of phospholipids, however, early membranes may have formed from monolayers or bilayers of fatty acids, which may have formed more readily in a prebiotic environment. Fatty acids have been synthesized in laboratories under a variety of prebiotic conditions and have been found on meteorites, suggesting their natural synthesis in nature. Oleic acid vesicles represent good models of membrane protocells that could have existed in prebiotic times. Electrostatic interactions induced by short, positively charged, hydrophobic peptides containing 7 amino acids in length or fewer, can attach RNA to a vesicle membrane, the basic cell membrane. Geothermal ponds and clay This fluid lipid bilayer cross section is made up entirely of phosphatidylcholine. Scientists have suggested that life began in hydrothermal vents in the deep sea, but a 2012 study suggests that inland pools of condensed and cooled geothermal vapor have the ideal characteristics for the origin of life. The conclusion is based mainly on the chemistry of modern cells, where the cytoplasm is rich in potassium, zinc, manganese, and phosphate ions, which are not widespread in marine environments. Such conditions, the researchers argue, are found only where hot hydrothermal fluid brings the ions to the surface‚Äîplaces such as geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and other geothermal features. Within these fuming and bubbling basins, water laden with zinc and manganese ions could have collected, cooled and condensed in shallow pools. Another study in the 1990s showed that montmorillonite clay can help create RNA chains of as many as 50 nucleotides joined together spontaneously into a single RNA molecule. Later, in 2002, it was discovered that by adding montmorillonite to a solution of fatty acid micelles (lipid spheres), the clay sped up the rate of vesicle formation 100-fold. Research has shown that some minerals can catalyze the stepwise formation of hydrocarbon tails of fatty acids from hydrogen and carbon monoxide gases‚Äîgases that may have been released from hydrothermal vents or geysers. Fatty acids of various lengths are eventually released into the surrounding water, but vesicle formation requires a higher concentration of fatty acids, so it is suggested that protocell formation started at land-bound hydrothermal vents such as geysers, mud pots, fumaroles and other geothermal features where water evaporates and concentrates the solute. Montmorillonite bubbles Another group suggests that primitive cells might have formed inside inorganic clay microcompartments, which can provide an ideal container for the synthesis and compartmentalization of complex organic molecules. Clay-armored bubbles form naturally when particles of montmorillonite clay collect on the outer surface of air bubbles under water. This creates a semi permeable vesicle from materials that are readily available in the environment. The authors remark that montmorillonite is known to serve as a chemical catalyst, encouraging lipids to form membranes and single nucleotides to join into strands of RNA. Primitive reproduction can be envisioned when the clay bubbles burst, releasing the lipid membrane-bound product into the surrounding medium. Membraneless droplets Another way to form primitive compartments that may lead to the formation of a protocell is polyesters membraneless structures that have the ability to host biochemicals (proteins and RNA) and/or scaffold the assemblies of lipids around them. While these droplets are leaky towards genetic materials, this leakiness could have facilitated the progenote hypothesis. Membrane transport Schematic showing two possible conformations of the lipids at the edge of a pore. In the top image the lipids have not rearranged, so the pore wall is hydrophobic. In the bottom image some of the lipid heads have bent over, so the pore wall is hydrophilic. For cellular organisms, the transport of specific molecules across compartmentalizing membrane barriers is essential in order to exchange content with their environment and with other individuals. For example, content exchange between individuals enables horizontal gene transfer, an important factor in the evolution of cellular life. While modern cells can rely on complicated protein machineries to catalyze these crucial processes, protocells must have accomplished this using more simple mechanisms. Protocells composed of fatty acids would have been able to easily exchange small molecules and ions with their environment. Membranes consisting of fatty acids have a relatively high permeability to molecules such as nucleoside monophosphate (NMP), nucleoside diphosphate (NDP), and nucleoside triphosphate (NTP), and may withstand millimolar concentrations of Mg2+. Osmotic pressure can also play a significant role regarding this passive membrane transport. Environmental effects have been suggested to trigger conditions under which a transport of larger molecules, such as DNA and RNA, across the membranes of protocells is possible. For example, it has been proposed that electroporation resulting from lightning strikes could enable such transport. Electroporation is the rapid increase in bilayer permeability induced by the application of a large artificial electric field across the membrane. During electroporation, the lipid molecules in the membrane shift position, opening up a pore (hole) that acts as a conductive pathway through which hydrophobic molecules like nucleic acids can pass the lipid bilayer. A similar transfer of content across protocells and with the surrounding solution can be caused by freezing and subsequent thawing. This could, for instance, occur in an environment in which day and night cycles cause recurrent freezing. Laboratory experiments have shown that such conditions allow an exchange of genetic information between populations of protocells. This can be explained by the fact that membranes are highly permeable at temperatures slightly below their phase transition temperature. If this point is reached during the freeze-thaw cycle, even large and highly charged molecules can temporarily pass the protocell membrane. Some molecules or particles are too large or too hydrophilic to pass through a lipid bilayer even under these conditions, but can be moved across the membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles, events which have also been observed for freeze-thaw cycles. This may eventually have led to mechanisms that facilitate movement of molecules to the inside of the protocell (endocytosis) or to release its contents into the extracellular space (exocytosis). Artificial models Langmuir-Blodgett deposition Starting with a technique commonly used to deposit molecules on a solid surface, Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett deposition, scientists are able to assemble phospholipid membranes of arbitrary complexity layer by layer. These artificial phospholipid membranes support functional insertion both of purified and of in situ expressed membrane proteins. The technique could help astrobiologists understand how the first living cells originated. Jeewanu protocells Surfactant molecules arranged on an air ‚Äì water interface Jeewanu protocells are synthetic chemical particles that possess cell-like structure and seem to have some functional living properties. First synthesized in 1963 from simple minerals and basic organics while exposed to sunlight, it is still reported to have some metabolic capabilities, the presence of semipermeable membrane, amino acids, phospholipids, carbohydrates and RNA-like molecules. However, the nature and properties of the Jeewanu remains to be clarified. In a similar synthesis experiment a frozen mixture of water, methanol, ammonia and carbon monoxide was exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This combination yielded large amounts of organic material that self-organised to form globules or vesicles when immersed in water. The investigating scientist considered these globules to resemble cell membranes that enclose and concentrate the chemistry of life, separating their interior from the outside world. The globules were between , or about the size of red blood cells. Remarkably, the globules fluoresced, or glowed, when exposed to UV light. Absorbing UV and converting it into visible light in this way was considered one possible way of providing energy to a primitive cell. If such globules played a role in the origin of life, the fluorescence could have been a precursor to primitive photosynthesis. Such fluorescence also provides the benefit of acting as a sunscreen, diffusing any damage that otherwise would be inflicted by UV radiation. Such a protective function would have been vital for life on the early Earth, since the ozone layer, which blocks out the sun's most destructive UV rays, did not form until after photosynthetic life began to produce oxygen. Bio-like structures The synthesis of three kinds of \\"jeewanu\\" have been reported; two of them were organic, and the other was inorganic. Other similar inorganic structures have also been produced. The investigating scientist (V. O. Kalinenko) referred to them as \\"bio-like structures\\" and \\"artificial cells\\". Formed in distilled water (as well as on agar gel) under the influence of an electric field, they lack protein, amino acids, purine or pyrimidine bases, and certain enzyme activities. According to NASA researchers, \\"presently known scientific principles of biology and biochemistry cannot account for living inorganic units\\" and \\"the postulated existence of these living units has not been proved\\". Ethics and controversy Protocell research has created controversy and opposing opinions, including critics of the vague definition of \\"artificial life\\". The creation of a basic unit of life is the most pressing ethical concern, although the most widespread worry about protocells is their potential threat to human health and the environment through uncontrolled replication.

In evolutionary biology, abiogenesis, or informally the origin of life (OoL),Compare: is the natural process by which life has arisen from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. While the details of this process are still unknown, the prevailing scientific hypothesis is that the transition from non-living to living entities was not a single event, but an evolutionary process of increasing complexity that involved molecular self-replication, self-assembly, autocatalysis, and the emergence of cell membranes. Although the occurrence of abiogenesis is uncontroversial among scientists, its possible mechanisms are poorly understood. There are several principles and hypotheses for abiogenesis could have occurred. The study of abiogenesis aims to determine how pre-life chemical reactions gave rise to life under conditions strikingly different from those on Earth today. It primarily uses tools from biology, chemistry, and geophysics, with more recent approaches attempting a synthesis of all three: more specifically, astrobiology, biochemistry, biophysics, geochemistry, molecular biology, oceanography and paleontology. Life functions through the specialized chemistry of carbon and water and builds largely upon four key families of chemicals: lipids (cell membranes), carbohydrates (sugars, cellulose), amino acids (protein metabolism), and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). Any successful theory of abiogenesis must explain the origins and interactions of these classes of molecules. Many approaches to abiogenesis investigate how self-replicating molecules, or their components, came into existence. Researchers generally think that current life descends from an RNA world, although other self-replicating molecules may have preceded RNA. Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment Synthesis of small organic molecules in a mixture of simple gases that is placed in a thermal gradient by heating (left) and cooling (right) the mixture at the same time, a mixture that is also subject to electrical discharges The classic 1952 Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment and similar research demonstrated that most amino acids, the chemical constituents of the proteins used in all living organisms, can be synthesized from inorganic compounds under conditions intended to replicate those of the early Earth. Scientists have proposed various external sources of energy that may have triggered these reactions, including lightning and radiation. Other approaches (\\"metabolism-first\\" hypotheses) focus on understanding how catalysis in chemical systems on the early Earth might have provided the precursor molecules necessary for self-replication. The alternative panspermia hypothesis Conference held at League City, TX speculates that microscopic life arose outside Earth by unknown mechanisms, and spread to the early Earth on space dust and meteoroids. It is known that complex organic molecules occur in the Solar System and in interstellar space, and these molecules may have provided starting material for the development of life on Earth. Earth remains the only place in the universe known to harbour life, and fossil evidence from the Earth informs most studies of abiogenesis. The age of the Earth is 4.54 Gy (Giga or billion year); the earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates from at least 3.5 Gya (Gy ago), and possibly as early as the Eoarchean Era (3.6-4.0 Gya). In 2017 scientists found possible evidence of early life on land in 3.48 Gyo (Gy old) geyserite and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. However, a number of discoveries suggest that life may have appeared on Earth even earlier. , microfossils (fossilised microorganisms) within hydrothermal-vent precipitates dated 3.77 to 4.28 Gya in rocks in Quebec may harbour the oldest record of life on Earth, suggesting life started soon after ocean formation 4.4 Gya during the Hadean Eon. The NASA strategy on abiogenesis states that it is necessary to identify interactions, intermediary structures and functions, energy sources, and environmental factors that contributed to the diversity, selection, and replication of evolvable macromolecular systems. Emphasis must continue to map the chemical landscape of potential primordial informational polymers. The advent of polymers that could replicate, store genetic information, and exhibit properties subject to selection likely was a critical step in the emergence of prebiotic chemical evolution.  Thermodynamics, self-organization, and information: Physics  Thermodynamics principles: Energy and entropy In antiquity it was commonly thought, for instance by Empedocles and Aristotle, that the life of the individuals of some species, and more generally, life itself, could start with high temperature, i.e. implicitly by thermal cycling. Similarly, it was realized early on that life requires a loss of entropy, or disorder, when molecules organize themselves into living matter. This Second Law of thermodynamics needs to be considered when self-organization of matter to higher complexity happens. Because living organisms are machines, the Second Law applies to life as well. =Obtaining free energy = Bernal said on the Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment that > it is not enough to explain the formation of such molecules, what is > necessary, is a physical-chemical explanation of the origins of these > molecules that suggests the presence of suitable sources and sinks for free > energy. Multiple sources of energy were available for chemical reactions on the early Earth. For example, heat (such as from geothermal processes) is a standard energy source for chemistry. Other examples include sunlight and electrical discharges (lightning), among others. In fact, lightning is a plausible energy source for the origin of life, given that just in the tropics lightning strikes about 100 million times a year. Computer simulations also suggest that cavitation in primordial water reservoirs such as breaking sea waves, streams and oceans can potentially lead to the synthesis of biogenic compounds. Unfavourable reactions can also be driven by highly favourable ones, as in the case of iron-sulfur chemistry. For example, this was probably important for carbon fixation (the conversion of carbon from its inorganic form to an organic one). Carbon fixation via iron-sulfur chemistry is highly favourable, and occurs at neutral pH and 100C. Iron-sulfur surfaces, which are abundant near hydrothermal vents, are also capable of producing small amounts of amino acids and other biological metabolites. Self-organization Hermann Haken The discipline of synergetics studies self-organization in physical systems. In his book Synergetics Hermann Haken has pointed out that different physical systems can be treated in a similar way. He gives as examples of self- organization several types of lasers, instabilities in fluid dynamics, including convection, and chemical and biochemical oscillations. In his preface he mentions the origin of life, but only in general terms: > The spontaneous formation of well organized structures out of germs or even > out of chaos is one of the most fascinating phenomena and most challenging > problems scientists are confronted with. Such phenomena are an experience of > our daily life when we observe the growth of plants and animals. Thinking of > much larger time scales, scientists are led into the problems of evolution, > and, ultimately, of the origin of living matter. When we try to explain or > understand in some sense these extremely complex biological phenomena it is > a natural question, whether processes of self-organization may be found in > much simpler systems of the unanimated world. In recent years it has become > more and more evident that there exists numerous examples in physical and > chemical systems where well organized spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal > structures arise out of chaotic states. Furthermore, as in living organisms, > the functioning of these systems can be maintained only by a flux of energy > (and matter) through them. In contrast to man-made machines, which are > devised to exhibit special structures and functionings, these structures > develop spontaneously‚Äîthey are selforganizing. ... =Multiple dissipative structures= This theory postulates that the hallmark of the origin and evolution of life is the microscopic dissipative structuring of organic pigments and their proliferation over the entire Earth surface. Present day life augments the entropy production of Earth in its solar environment by dissipating ultraviolet and visible photons into heat through organic pigments in water. This heat then catalyzes a host of secondary dissipative processes such as the water cycle, ocean and wind currents, hurricanes, etc. = Selforganization by dissipative structures= Ilya Prigogine 1977cThe 19th-century physicist Ludwig Boltzmann first recognized that the struggle for existence of living organisms was neither over raw material nor energy, but instead had to do with entropy production derived from the conversion of the solar spectrum into heat by these systems.Boltzmann, L. (1886) The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in: Ludwig Boltzmann: Theoretical physics and Selected writings, edited by: McGinness, B., D. Reidel, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, 1974. Boltzmann thus realized that living systems, like all irreversible processes, were dependent on the dissipation of a generalized chemical potential for their existence. In his book \\"What is Life\\", the 20th-century physicist Erwin Schr√∂dingerSchr√∂dinger, Erwin (1944) What is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell. Cambridge University Press emphasized the importance of Boltzmann's deep insight into the irreversible thermodynamic nature of living systems, suggesting that this was the physics and chemistry behind the origin and evolution of life. However, irreversible processes, and much less living systems, could not be conveniently analyzed under this perspective until Lars Onsager,Onsager, L. (1931) Reciprocal Relations in Irreversible Processes I and II, Phys. Rev. 37, 405; 38, 2265 (1931) and later Ilya Prigogine,Prigogine, I. (1967) An Introduction to the Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes, Wiley, New York developed an elegant mathematical formalism for treating the \\"self- organization\\" of material under a generalized chemical potential. This formalism became known as Classical Irreversible Thermodynamics and Prigogine was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977 \\"for his contributions to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, particularly the theory of dissipative structures\\". The analysis by Prigogine showed that if a system were left to evolve under an imposed external potential, material could spontaneously organize (lower its entropy) forming what he called \\"dissipative structures\\" which would increase the dissipation of the externally imposed potential (augment the global entropy production). Non-equilibrium thermodynamics has since been successfully applied to the analysis of living systems, from the biochemical production of ATP to optimizing bacterial metabolic pathwaysUnrean, P., Srienc, F. (2011) Metabolic networks evolve towards states of maximum entropy production, Metabolic Engineering 13, 666‚Äì673. to complete ecosystems.Zotin, A.I. (1984) \\"Bioenergetic trends of evolutionary progress of organisms\\", in: Thermodynamics and regulation of biological processes Lamprecht, I. and Zotin, A.I. (eds.), De Gruyter, Berlin, pp. 451‚Äì458.  Current life, the result of abiogenesis: biology Definition of life When discussing the origin of life, a definition of life itself is fundamental. The definition is somewhat disagreed upon (although follows the same basic principles) because different biology textbooks define life differently. James Gould: > Most dictionaries define life as the property that distinguishes the living > from the dead, and define dead as being deprived of life. These singularly > circular and unsatisfactory definitions give us no clue to what we have in > common with protozoans and plants. whereas according to Neil Campbell and Jane Reece > The phenomenon we call life defies a simple, one-sentence definition. This difference can also be found in books on the origin of life. John Casti gives a single sentence: > By more or general consensus nowadays, an entity is considered to be \\"alive\\" > if it has the capacity to carry out three basic functional activities: > metabolism, self-repair, and replication. Dirk Schulze-Makuch and Louis Irwin spend in contrast the whole first chapter of their book on this subject. =Fermentation= Citric acid cycle Overall diagram of the chemical reactions of metabolism, in which the citric acid cycle can be recognized as the circle just below the middle of the figure Albert Lehninger has stated around 1970 that fermentation, including glycolysis, is a suitable primitive energy source for the origin of life. > Since living organisms probably first arose in an atmosphere lacking oxygen, > anaerobic fermentation is the simplest and most primitive type of biological > mechanism for obtaining energy from nutrient molecules. Fermentation involves glycolysis, which, rather inefficiently, transduces the chemical energy of sugar into the chemical energy of ATP. =Chemiosmosis= Oxidative phosphorylation Chemiosmotic coupling mitochondrion As Fermentation had around 1970 been elucidated, whereas the mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation had not and some controversies still existed, fermentation may have looked too complex for investigators of the origin of life at that time. Peter Mitchell's Chemiosmosis is now however generally accepted as correct. Even Peter Mitchell himself assumed that fermentation preceded chemiosmosis. Chemiosmosis is however ubiquitous in life. A model for the origin of life has been presented in terms of chemiosmosis. Both respiration by mitochondria and photosynthesis in chloroplasts make use of chemiosmosis to generate most of their ATP. Today the energy source of all life can be linked to photosynthesis, and one speaks of primary production by sunlight. The oxygen used for oxidizing reducing compounds by organisms at hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean is the result of photosynthesis at the Oceans' surface. ATP synthase Depiction of ATP synthase using the chemiosmotic proton gradient to power ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation. Paul Boyer The mechanism of ATP synthesis is complex and involves a closed membrane in which the ATP synthase is embedded. The ATP is synthesized by the F1 subunit of ATP synthase by the binding change mechanism discovered by Paul Boyer. The energy required to release formed strongly-bound ATP has its origin in protons that move across the membrane. These protons have been set across the membrane during respiration or photosynthesis. =RNA world= ribosome 30S subunit from Thermus thermophilus. Proteins are shown in blue and the single RNA chain in orange. The RNA world hypothesis describes an early Earth with self-replicating and catalytic RNA but no DNA or proteins. It is widely accepted that current life on Earth descends from an RNA world,: \\"There is now strong evidence indicating that an RNA World did indeed exist before DNA- and protein-based life.\\" * : \\"[The RNA world's existence] has broad support within the community today.\\" although RNA-based life may not have been the first life to exist. This conclusion is drawn from many independent lines of evidence, such as the observations that RNA is central to the translation process and that small RNAs can catalyze all of the chemical groups and information transfers required for life. The structure of the ribosome has been called the \\"smoking gun,\\" as it showed that the ribosome is a ribozyme, with a central core of RNA and no amino acid side chains within 18 angstroms of the active site where peptide bond formation is catalyzed. The concept of the RNA world was first proposed in 1962 by Alexander Rich, and the term was coined by Walter Gilbert in 1986. In March 2020, astronomer Tomonori Totani presented a statistical approach for explaining how an initial active RNA molecule might have been produced randomly in the universe sometime since the Big Bang. Phylogeny and LUCA cladogram demonstrating extreme hyperthermophiles as occur in volcanic hot springs at the base of the phylogenetic tree of life. The most commonly accepted location of the root of the tree of life is between a monophyletic domain Bacteria and a clade formed by Archaea and Eukaryota of what is referred to as the \\"traditional tree of life\\" based on several molecular studies starting with Carl Woese. A very small minority of studies have concluded differently, namely that the root is in the domain Bacteria, either in the phylum Firmicutes or that the phylum Chloroflexi is basal to a clade with Archaea+Eukaryotes and the rest of Bacteria as proposed by Thomas Cavalier-Smith. More recently, Peter Ward has proposed an alternative view which is rooted in abiotic RNA synthesis which becomes enclosed within a capsule and then creates RNA ribozyme replicates. It is proposed that this then bifurcates between Dominion Ribosa (RNA life), and after the loss of ribozymes RNA viruses as Domain Viorea, and Dominion Terroa, which after creating a large cell within a lipid wall, creating DNA the 20 based amino acids and the triplet code, is established as the last universal common ancestor or LUCA, of earlier phylogenic trees. In 2016, a set of 355 genes likely present in the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms living on Earth was identified. A total of 6.1 million prokaryotic protein coding genes from various phylogenic trees were sequenced, identifying 355 protein clusters from amongst 286,514 protein clusters that were probably common to LUCA. The results > . . . depict LUCA as anaerobic, CO2-fixing, H2-dependent with a > Wood‚ÄìLjungdahl pathway, N2-fixing and thermophilic. LUCA's biochemistry was > replete with FeS clusters and radical reaction mechanisms. Its cofactors > reveal dependence upon transition metals, flavins, S-adenosyl methionine, > coenzyme A, ferredoxin, molybdopterin, corrins and selenium. Its genetic > code required nucleoside modifications and S-adenosylmethionine-dependent > methylations.\\" The results depict methanogenic clostridia as a basal clade in the 355 phylogenies examined, and suggest that LUCA inhabited an anaerobic hydrothermal vent setting in a geochemically active environment rich in H2, CO2 and iron. A study at the University of D√ºsseldorf created phylogenic trees based upon 6 million genes from bacteria and archaea, and identified 355 protein families that were probably present in the LUCA. They were based upon an anaerobic metabolism fixing carbon dioxide and nitrogen. It suggests that the LUCA evolved in an environment rich in hydrogen, carbon dioxide and iron.Nature Vol 535, 28 July 2016,\\"Early Life Liked it Hot\\", p.468 Key issues in abiogenesis =What came first: protein or nucleic acids?= Possible precursors for the evolution of protein synthesis include a mechanism to synthesize short peptide cofactors or form a mechanism for the duplication of RNA. It is likely that the ancestral ribosome was composed entirely of RNA, although some roles have since been taken over by proteins. Major remaining questions on this topic include identifying the selective force for the evolution of the ribosome and determining how the genetic code arose. Eugene Koonin said, > Despite considerable experimental and theoretical effort, no compelling > scenarios currently exist for the origin of replication and translation, the > key processes that together comprise the core of biological systems and the > apparent pre-requisite of biological evolution.

Chiral refers to nonsuperimposable 3D forms that are mirror images of one another, as are left and right hands. Living organisms use molecules that have the same chirality (\\"handedness\\"): with almost no exceptions, amino acids are left- handed while nucleotides and sugars are right-handed. Chiral molecules can be synthesized, but in the absence of a chiral source or a chiral catalyst, they are formed in a 50/50 mixture of both enantiomers (called a racemic mixture). Known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the electroweak interaction; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by circularly polarized light, quartz crystals, or the Earth's rotation, statistical fluctuations during racemic synthesis, \\"Special Issue: Proceedings from the Eighteenth International Symposium on Chirality (ISCD-18), Busan, Korea, 2006\\" and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Once established, chirality would be selected for. A small bias (enantiomeric excess) in the population can be amplified into a large one by asymmetric autocatalysis, such as in the Soai reaction. In asymmetric autocatalysis, the catalyst is a chiral molecule, which means that a chiral molecule is catalyzing its own production. An initial enantiomeric excess, such as can be produced by polarized light, then allows the more abundant enantiomer to outcompete the other. Clark has suggested that homochirality may have started in outer space, as the studies of the amino acids on the Murchison meteorite showed that L-alanine is more than twice as frequent as its D form, and L-glutamic acid was more than three times prevalent than its D counterpart. Various chiral crystal surfaces can also act as sites for possible concentration and assembly of chiral monomer units into macromolecules. Compounds found on meteorites suggest that the chirality of life derives from abiogenic synthesis, since amino acids from meteorites show a left-handed bias, whereas sugars show a predominantly right- handed bias, the same as found in living organisms.  Early universe and Earth: astronomy and geology  Early universe with first stars Soon after the Big Bang, which occurred roughly 14 Gya, the only chemical elements present in the universe were hydrogen, helium, and lithium, the three lightest atoms in the periodic table. These elements gradually came together to form stars. These early stars were massive and short-lived, producing heavier elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. Carbon, currently the fourth most abundant chemical element in the universe (after hydrogen, helium and oxygen), was formed mainly in white dwarf stars, particularly those bigger than two solar masses. As these stars reached the end of their lifecycles, they ejected these heavier elements, among them carbon and oxygen, throughout the universe. These heavier elements allowed for the formation of new objects, including rocky planets and other bodies. Emergence of the Solar System According to the nebular hypothesis, the formation and evolution of the Solar System began 4.6 Gya with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud.Formation of Solar Systems: Solar Nebular Theory. University of Massachusetts Amherst, Department of Astronomy. Accessed on 27 September 2019. Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed. Emergence of Earth The Earth, formed 4.5 Gya, was at first inhospitable to any living organisms. Based on numerous observations and studies of the geological time- scale, the Hadean Earth is thought to have had a secondary atmosphere, formed through degassing of the rocks that accumulated from planetesimal impactors. At first, it was thought that the Earth's atmosphere consisted of hydrogen compounds‚Äîmethane, ammonia and Water vapor‚Äîand that life began under such reducing conditions, which are conducive to the formation of organic molecules. According to later models, suggested by studying ancient minerals, the atmosphere in the late Hadean period consisted largely of water vapor, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and sulfur compounds. During its formation, the Earth lost a significant part of its initial mass, with a nucleus of the heavier rocky elements of the protoplanetary disk remaining. As a consequence, Earth lacked the gravity to hold any molecular hydrogen in its atmosphere, and rapidly lost it during the Hadean period, along with the bulk of the original inert gases. The solution of carbon dioxide in water is thought to have made the seas slightly acidic, giving them a pH of about 5.5. The atmosphere at the time has been characterized as a \\"gigantic, productive outdoor chemical laboratory.\\" It may have been similar to the mixture of gases released today by volcanoes, which still support some abiotic chemistry. Emergence of the ocean Oceans may have appeared first in the Hadean Eon, as soon as 200 My after the Earth formed, in a hot, 100 C, reducing environment, and the pH of about 5.8 rose rapidly towards neutral. This scenario has found support from the dating of 4.404 Gyo zircon crystals from metamorphosed quartzite of Mount Narryer in the Western Australia Jack Hills of the Pilbara, which provide evidence that oceans and continental crust existed within 150 Ma of Earth's formation. Despite the likely increased volcanism and existence of many smaller tectonic \\"platelets,\\" it has been suggested that between 4.4-4.3 Gyo, the Earth was a water world, with little if any continental crust, an extremely turbulent atmosphere and a hydrosphere subject to intense ultraviolet (UV) light, from a T Tauri stage Sun, cosmic radiation and continued bolide impacts. Late heavy bombardment The Hadean environment would have been highly hazardous to modern life. Frequent collisions with large objects, up to 500 km in diameter, would have been sufficient to sterilize the planet and vaporize the oceans within a few months of impact, with hot steam mixed with rock vapor becoming high altitude clouds that would completely cover the planet. After a few months, the height of these clouds would have begun to decrease but the cloud base would still have been elevated for about the next thousand years. After that, it would have begun to rain at low altitude. For another two thousand years, rains would slowly have drawn down the height of the clouds, returning the oceans to their original depth only 3,000 y after the impact event. Traditionally it was thought that during the period between 4.28 and 3.8 Gya, changes in the orbits of the giant planets may have caused a heavy bombardment by asteroids and comets that pockmarked the Moon and the other inner planets (Mercury, Mars, and presumably Earth and Venus). This would likely have repeatedly sterilized the planet, had life appeared before that time. Geologically, the Hadean Earth would have been far more active than at any other time in its history. Studies of meteorites suggests that radioactive isotopes such as aluminium-26 with a half-life of 7.17 ky, and potassium-40 with a half-life of 1.25 Gy, isotopes mainly produced in supernovae, were much more common. Internal heating as a result of gravitational sorting between the core and the mantle would have caused a great deal of mantle convection, with the probable result of many more smaller and more active tectonic plates than now exist. The time periods between such devastating environmental events give time windows for the possible origin of life in the early environments. If the deep marine hydrothermal setting was the site for the origin of life, then abiogenesis could have happened as early as 4.0-4.2 Gya. If the site was at the surface of the Earth, abiogenesis could only have occurred between 3.7-4.0 Gya. Estimates of the production of organics from these sources suggest that the Late Heavy Bombardment before 3.5 Ga within the early atmosphere made available quantities of organics comparable to those produced by terrestrial sources. It has been estimated that the Late Heavy Bombardment may also have effectively sterilized the Earth's surface to a depth of tens of meters. If life evolved deeper than this, it would have also been shielded from the early high levels of ultraviolet radiation from the T Tauri stage of the Sun's evolution. Simulations of geothermically heated oceanic crust yield far more organics than those found in the Miller‚ÄìUrey experiments. In the deep hydrothermal vents, Everett Shock has found \\"there is an enormous thermodynamic drive to form organic compounds, as seawater and hydrothermal fluids, which are far from equilibrium, mix and move towards a more stable state.\\" Shock has found that the available energy is maximized at around 100‚Äì150 C, precisely the temperatures at which the hyperthermophilic bacteria and thermoacidophilic archaea have been found, at the base of the phylogenetic tree of life closest to the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA).  Earliest evidence of life: palaeontology Precambrian stromatolites in the Siyeh Formation, Glacier National Park. A 2002 study suggested that these 3.5 Gyo (billion year old) formations contain fossilized cyanobacteria microbes. This suggests they are evidence of one of the earliest life forms on Earth. Stromatolites in Shark Bay The earliest life on Earth existed more than 3.5 Gya (billion years ago), during the Eoarchean Era when sufficient crust had solidified following the molten Hadean Eon. The earliest physical evidence so far found consists of microfossils in the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt of Northern Quebec, in banded iron formation rocks at least 3.77 and possibly 4.28 Gyo. This finding suggested life developed very soon after oceans formed. The structure of the microbes was noted to be similar to bacteria found near hydrothermal vents in the modern era, and provided support for the hypothesis that abiogenesis began near hydrothermal vents. Biogenic graphite has been found in 3.7 Gyo metasedimentary rocks from southwestern Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 Gyo sandstone from Western Australia. Evidence of early life in rocks from Akilia Island, near the Isua supracrustal belt in southwestern Greenland, dating to 3.7 Gya have shown biogenic carbon isotopes. In other parts of the Isua supracrustal belt, graphite inclusions trapped within garnet crystals are connected to the other elements of life: oxygen, nitrogen, and possibly phosphorus in the form of phosphate, providing further evidence for life 3.7 Gya. At Strelley Pool, in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, compelling evidence of early life was found in pyrite- bearing sandstone in a fossilized beach, that showed rounded tubular cells that oxidized sulfur by photosynthesis in the absence of oxygen. Further research on zircons from Western Australia in 2015 suggested that life likely existed on Earth at least 4.1 Gya. Early edition, published online before print.  Conceptual history until the 1960s: biology   Panspermia  Panspermia is the hypothesis that life exists throughout the universe, distributed by meteoroids, asteroids, comets and planetoids.Rampelotto, P. H. (2010). \\"Panspermia: A promising field of research\\". In: Astrobiology Science Conference. Abs 5224. The panspermia hypothesis does not attempt to explain how life first originated but merely shifts the origin to another planet or a comet. The advantage of an extraterrestrial origin of primitive life is that life is not required to have formed on each planet it occurs on, but rather in a single location, and then spread about the galaxy to other star systems via cometary and/or meteorite impact. Evidence for the panspermia hypothesis is scant, but it finds some support in studies of Martian meteorites found in Antarctica and in studies of extremophile microbes' survival in outer space tests. In August 2020, scientists reported that bacteria from Earth, particularly Deinococcus radiodurans, which is highly resistant to environmental hazards, were found to survive for three years in outer space, based on studies conducted on the International Space Station. =Origin of life posited directly after the Big Bang and have spread over the entire Universe= An extreme speculation is that the biochemistry of life could have begun as early as 17 My (million years) after the Big Bang, during a habitable epoch, and that life may exist throughout the universe. =Panspermia by life brought from Mars to Earth= Carl Zimmer has speculated that the chemical conditions, including the presence of boron, molybdenum and oxygen needed for the initial production of RNA, may have been better on early Mars than on early Earth. If so, life-suitable molecules originating on Mars may have later migrated to Earth via meteor ejections.  Spontaneous generation  =General acceptance of spontaneous generation until the 19th century= Traditional religion attributed the origin of life to supernatural deities who created the natural world. Spontaneous generation, the first naturalistic theory of life arising from non-life, goes back to Aristotle and ancient Greek philosophy, and continued to have support in Western scholarship until the 19th century. Classical notions of spontaneous generation held that certain \\"lower\\" or \\"vermin\\" animals are generated by decaying organic substances. According to Aristotle, it was readily observable that aphids arise from dew on plants, flies from putrid matter, mice from dirty hay, crocodiles from rotting sunken logs, and so on. A related theory was heterogenesis: that some forms of life could arise from different forms (e.g. bees from flowers). The modern scientist John Bernal said that the basic idea of such theories was that life was continuously created as a result of chance events. In the 17th century, people began to question such assumptions. In 1646, Thomas Browne published his Pseudodoxia Epidemica (subtitled Enquiries into Very many Received Tenets, and commonly Presumed Truths), which was an attack on false beliefs and \\"vulgar errors.\\" His contemporary, Alexander Ross, erroneously refuted him, stating: > To question this [spontaneous generation], is to question Reason, Sense, and > Experience: If he doubts of this, let him go to √Ügypt, and there he will > find the fields swarming with mice begot of the mud of Nylus, to the great > calamity of the Inhabitants. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek In 1665, Robert Hooke published the first drawings of a microorganism. Hooke was followed in 1676 by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who drew and described microorganisms that are now thought to have been protozoa and bacteria. Many felt the existence of microorganisms was evidence in support of spontaneous generation, since microorganisms seemed too simplistic for sexual reproduction, and asexual reproduction through cell division had not yet been observed. Van Leeuwenhoek took issue with the ideas common at the time that fleas and lice could spontaneously result from putrefaction, and that frogs could likewise arise from slime. Using a broad range of experiments ranging from sealed and open meat incubation and the close study of insect reproduction he became, by the 1680s, convinced that spontaneous generation was incorrect. The first experimental evidence against spontaneous generation came in 1668 when Francesco Redi showed that no maggots appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs. It was gradually shown that, at least in the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms, the previous sentiment regarding spontaneous generation was false. The alternative hypothesis was biogenesis: that every living thing came from a pre-existing living thing (omne vivum ex ovo, Latin for \\"every living thing from an egg\\"). In 1768, Lazzaro Spallanzani demonstrated that microbes were present in the air, and could be killed by boiling. In 1861, Louis Pasteur performed a series of experiments that demonstrated that organisms such as bacteria and fungi do not spontaneously appear in sterile, nutrient-rich media, but could only appear by invasion from without. =Spontaneous generation considered disproven in the 19th century= Louis Pasteur Charles Darwin in 1879 By the middle of the 19th century, biogenesis had accumulated so much evidence in support that the alternative theory of spontaneous generation had been effectively disproven. Pasteur remarked, about a finding of his in 1864 which he considered definitive, > Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal > blow struck by this simple experiment. gave a mechanism by which life diversified from a few simple organisms to a variety of to complex forms. Today, scientists agree that all current life descends from earlier life, which has become progressively more complex and diverse through Charles Darwin's mechanism of evolution by natural selection. Darwin wrote to Hooker in 1863 stating that, > It is mere rubbish, thinking at present of the origin of life; one might as > well think of the origin of matter. In On the Origin of Species, he had referred to life having been \\"created\\", by which he \\"really meant 'appeared' by some wholly unknown process\\", but had soon regretted using the Old Testament term \\"creation\\". = Etymology of biogenesis and abiogenesis= The term biogenesis is usually credited to either Henry Bastian or to Thomas Huxley. Bastian used the term around 1869 in an unpublished exchange with John Tyndall to mean \\"life-origination or commencement\\". In 1870, Huxley, as new president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, delivered an address entitled Biogenesis and Abiogenesis. In it he introduced the term biogenesis (with an opposite meaning to Bastian's) as well as abiogenesis: :And thus the hypothesis that living matter always arises by the agency of pre-existing living matter, took definite shape; and had, henceforward, a right to be considered and a claim to be refuted, in each particular case, before the production of living matter in any other way could be admitted by careful reasoners. It will be necessary for me to refer to this hypothesis so frequently, that, to save circumlocution, I shall call it the hypothesis of Biogenesis; and I shall term the contrary doctrine‚Äîthat living matter may be produced by not living matter‚Äîthe hypothesis of Abiogenesis. Subsequently, in the preface to Bastian's 1871 book, The Modes of Origin of Lowest Organisms, Bastian referred to the possible confusion with Huxley's usage and explicitly renounced his own meaning: :A word of explanation seems necessary with regard to the introduction of the new term Archebiosis. I had originally, in unpublished writings, adopted the word Biogenesis to express the same meaning‚Äîviz., life- origination or commencement. But in the meantime, the word Biogenesis has been made use of, quite independently, by a distinguished biologist [Huxley], who wished to make it bear a totally different meaning. He also introduced the word Abiogenesis. I have been informed, however, on the best authority, that neither of these words can‚Äîwith any regard to the language from which they are derived‚Äîbe supposed to bear the meanings which have of late been publicly assigned to them. Wishing to avoid all needless confusion, I therefore renounced the use of the word Biogenesis, and being, for the reason just given, unable to adopt the other term, I was compelled to introduce a new word, in order to designate the process by which living matter is supposed to come into being, independently of pre-existing living matter. Since the end of the nineteenth century, 'evolutive abiogenesis' means increasing complexity and evolution of matter from inert to living states.Abiogenesis ‚Äì Definition. 20 April 2015. Encyclopedia of Astrobiology.  Oparin: Primordial soup hypothesis  There is no single generally accepted model for the origin of life. Scientists have proposed several plausible hypotheses which share some common elements. While differing in details, these hypotheses are based on the framework laid out by Alexander Oparin (in 1924) and John Haldane (in 1925), that the first molecules constituting the earliest cells > . . . were synthesized under natural conditions by a slow process of > molecular evolution, and these molecules then organized into the first > molecular system with properties with biological order\\". * Oparin and Haldane suggested that the atmosphere of the early Earth may have been chemically reducing in nature, composed primarily of methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), water (H2O), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2) or carbon monoxide (CO), and phosphate (PO43‚àí), with molecular oxygen (O2) and ozone (O3) either rare or absent. According to later models, the atmosphere in the late Hadean period consisted largely of nitrogen (N2) and carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrogen (H2), and sulfur compounds; while it did lack molecular oxygen and ozone, it was not as chemically reducing as Oparin and Haldane supposed. No new notable research or hypothesis on the subject appeared until 1924, when Oparin reasoned that atmospheric oxygen prevents the synthesis of certain organic compounds that are necessary building blocks for life. In his book The Origin of Life, he proposed (echoing Darwin) that the \\"spontaneous generation of life\\" that had been attacked by Pasteur did, in fact, occur once, but was now impossible because the conditions found on the early Earth had changed, and preexisting organisms would immediately consume any spontaneously generated organism. Oparin argued that a \\"primeval soup\\" of organic molecules could be created in an oxygenless atmosphere through the action of sunlight. These would combine in ever more complex ways until they formed coacervate droplets. These droplets would \\"grow\\" by fusion with other droplets, and \\"reproduce\\" through fission into daughter droplets, and so have a primitive metabolism in which factors that promote \\"cell integrity\\" survive, and those that do not become extinct. Many modern theories of the origin of life still take Oparin's ideas as a starting point. About this time, Haldane suggested that the Earth's prebiotic oceans (quite different from their modern counterparts) would have formed a \\"hot dilute soup\\" in which organic compounds could have formed. Bernal called this idea biopoiesis or biopoesis, the process of living matter evolving from self- replicating but non-living molecules, and proposed that biopoiesis passes through a number of intermediate stages. Robert Shapiro has summarized the \\"primordial soup\\" theory of Oparin and Haldane in its \\"mature form\\" as follows: # The early Earth had a chemically reducing atmosphere. # This atmosphere, exposed to energy in various forms, produced simple organic compounds (\\"monomers\\"). # These compounds accumulated in a \\"soup\\" that may have concentrated at various locations (shorelines, oceanic vents etc.). # By further transformation, more complex organic polymers‚Äîand ultimately life‚Äîdeveloped in the soup. John Bernal John Bernal showed that based upon this and subsequent work there is no difficulty in principle in forming most of the molecules we recognize as the necessary molecules for life from their inorganic precursors. The underlying hypothesis held by Oparin, Haldane, Bernal, Miller and Urey, for instance, was that multiple conditions on the primeval Earth favoured chemical reactions that synthesized the same set of complex organic compounds from such simple precursors. Bernal coined the term biopoiesis in 1949 to refer to the origin of life. In 1967, he suggested that it occurred in three \\"stages\\": # the origin of biological monomers # the origin of biological polymers # the evolution from molecules to cells Bernal suggested that evolution commenced between stages 1 and 2. Bernal regarded the third stage, in which biological reactions were incorporated behind a cell's boundary, as the most difficult. Modern work on the way that cell membranes self-assemble, and the work on micropores in various substrates, may be a key step towards understanding the development of independent free-living cells. Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment Stanley Miller Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment JP One of the most important pieces of experimental support for the \\"soup\\" theory came in 1952. Stanley Miller and Harold Urey performed an experiment that demonstrated how organic molecules could have spontaneously formed from inorganic precursors under conditions like those posited by the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis. The now-famous Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment used a highly reducing mixture of gases‚Äîmethane, ammonia, and hydrogen, as well as water vapor‚Äîto form simple organic monomers such as amino acids. The mixture of gases was cycled through an apparatus that delivered electrical sparks to the mixture. After one week, it was found that about 10% to 15% of the carbon in the system was then in the form of a racemic mixture of organic compounds, including amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. This provided direct experimental support for the second point of the \\"soup\\" theory, and it is around the remaining two points of the theory that much of the debate now centers. A 2011 reanalysis of the saved vials containing the original extracts that resulted from the Miller and Urey experiments, using current and more advanced analytical equipment and technology, has uncovered more biochemicals than originally discovered in the 1950s. One of the more important findings was 23 amino acids, far more than the five originally found.  Primordial origin of biological molecules: Chemistry  The chemical processes on the pre-biotic early Earth are called chemical evolution. The elements, except for hydrogen and helium, ultimately derive from stellar nucleosynthesis. In 2016, astronomers reported that the very basic chemical ingredients of life‚Äîthe carbon-hydrogen molecule (CH, or methylidyne radical), the carbon-hydrogen positive ion (CH+) and the carbon ion (C+)‚Äîare largely the result of ultraviolet light from stars, rather than other forms of radiation from supernovae and young stars, as thought earlier. Complex molecules, including organic molecules, form naturally both in space and on planets. There are two possible sources of organic molecules on the early Earth: # Terrestrial origins ‚Äì organic molecule synthesis driven by impact shocks or by other energy sources (such as UV light, redox coupling, or electrical discharges; e.g., Miller's experiments) # Extraterrestrial origins ‚Äì formation of organic molecules in interstellar dust clouds, which rain down on planets. Post is reprinted from materials provided by the Rochester Institute of Technology. * (See pseudo-panspermia)  Observed extraterrestrial organic molecules  An organic compound is any member of a large class of gaseous, liquid, or solid chemicals whose molecules contain carbon. Carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the Universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon is abundant in the Sun, stars, comets, and in the atmospheres of most planets. Organic compounds are relatively common in space, formed by \\"factories of complex molecular synthesis\\" which occur in molecular clouds and circumstellar envelopes, and chemically evolve after reactions are initiated mostly by ionizing radiation. Based on computer model studies, the complex organic molecules necessary for life may have formed on dust grains in the protoplanetary disk surrounding the Sun before the formation of the Earth. According to the computer studies, this same process may also occur around other stars that acquire planets. =Amino acids= NASA announced in 2009 that scientists had identified another fundamental chemical building block of life in a comet for the first time, glycine, an amino acid, which was detected in material ejected from comet Wild 2 in 2004 and grabbed by NASA's Stardust probe. Glycine has been detected in meteorites before. Carl Pilcher, who leads the NASA Astrobiology Institute commented that > The discovery of glycine in a comet supports the idea that the fundamental > building blocks of life are prevalent in space, and strengthens the argument > that life in the universe may be common rather than rare. Comets are encrusted with outer layers of dark material, thought to be a tar- like substance composed of complex organic material formed from simple carbon compounds after reactions initiated mostly by ionizing radiation. It is possible that a rain of material from comets could have brought significant quantities of such complex organic molecules to Earth. Amino acids which were formed extraterrestrially may also have arrived on Earth via comets. It is estimated that during the Late Heavy Bombardment, meteorites may have delivered up to five million tons of organic prebiotic elements to Earth per year. = PAH world hypothesis = Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are the most common and abundant of the known polyatomic molecules in the observable universe, and are considered a likely constituent of the primordial sea. In 2010, PAHs, have been detected in nebulae. The Cat's Paw Nebula lies inside the Milky Way Galaxy and is located in the constellation Scorpius. Green areas show regions where radiation from hot stars collided with large molecules and small dust grains called \\"polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\\" (PAHs), causing them to fluoresce. (Spitzer space telescope, 2018) Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are known to be abundant in the universe, See the Ames Research Center 2009 annual team report to the NASA Astrobiology Institute here . including in the interstellar medium, in comets, and in meteorites, and are some of the most complex molecules so far found in space. Other sources of complex molecules have been postulated, including extraterrestrial stellar or interstellar origin. For example, from spectral analyses, organic molecules are known to be present in comets and meteorites. In 2004, a team detected traces of PAHs in a nebula. In 2010, another team also detected PAHs, along with fullerenes, in nebulae. The use of PAHs has also been proposed as a precursor to the RNA world in the PAH world hypothesis. The Spitzer Space Telescope has detected a star, HH 46-IR, which is forming by a process similar to that by which the Sun formed. In the disk of material surrounding the star, there is a very large range of molecules, including cyanide compounds, hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide. In 2012, NASA scientists reported that PAHs, subjected to interstellar medium conditions, are transformed, through hydrogenation, oxygenation and hydroxylation, to more complex organics‚Äî\\"a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively.\\" Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their spectroscopic signature which could be one of the reasons \\"for the lack of PAH detection in interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks.\\" NASA maintains a database for tracking PAHs in the universe. More than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets. =Nucleobases= Observations suggest that the majority of organic compounds introduced on Earth by interstellar dust particles are considered principal agents in the formation of complex molecules, thanks to their peculiar surface-catalytic activities. \\"Paper presented at the Symposium 'Astrochemistry: molecules in space and time' (Rome, 4‚Äì5 November 2010), sponsored by Fondazione 'Guido Donegani', Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei.\\" Studies reported in 2008, based on 12C/13C isotopic ratios of organic compounds found in the Murchison meteorite, suggested that the RNA component uracil and related molecules, including xanthine, were formed extraterrestrially. In 2011, a report based on NASA studies of meteorites found on Earth was published suggesting DNA components (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules) were made in outer space. Scientists also found that the cosmic dust permeating the universe contains complex organics (\\"amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic‚Äìaliphatic structure\\") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars. Sun Kwok of The University of Hong Kong suggested that these compounds may have been related to the development of life on Earth said that \\"If this is the case, life on Earth may have had an easier time getting started as these organics can serve as basic ingredients for life.\\" =The sugar glycolaldehyde= Formation of glycolaldehyde in stardust Glycolaldehyde, the first example of an interstellar sugar molecule, was detected in the star-forming region near the centre of our galaxy. It was discovered in 2000 by Jes J√∏rgensen and Jan Hollis. In 2012, J√∏rgensen's team reported the detection of glycolaldehyde in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422 400 light years from Earth. Glycolaldehyde is needed to form RNA, which is similar in function to DNA. These findings suggest that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior to the formation of planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation. Because sugars are associated with both metabolism and the genetic code, two of the most basic aspects of life, it is thought the discovery of extraterrestrial sugar increases the likelihood that life may exist elsewhere in our galaxy. = Polyphosphates = A problem in most scenarios of abiogenesis is that the thermodynamic equilibrium of amino acid versus peptides is in the direction of separate amino acids. What has been missing is some force that drives polymerization. The resolution of this problem may well be in the properties of polyphosphates. Polyphosphates are formed by polymerization of ordinary monophosphate ions PO43-. Several mechanisms of organic molecule synthesis have been investigated. Polyphosphates cause polymerization of amino acids into peptides. They are also logical precursors in the synthesis of such key biochemical compounds as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A key issue seems to be that calcium reacts with soluble phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate (apatite), so some plausible mechanism must be found to keep calcium ions from causing precipitation of phosphate. There has been much work on this topic over the years, but an interesting new idea is that meteorites may have introduced reactive phosphorus species on the early Earth. Based on recent computer model studies, the complex organic molecules necessary for life may have formed in the protoplanetary disk of dust grains surrounding the Sun before the formation of the Earth. According to the computer studies, this same process may also occur around other stars that acquire planets. (Also see Extraterrestrial organic molecules). The accumulation and concentration of organic molecules on a planetary surface is also considered an essential early step for the origin of life. Identifying and understanding the mechanisms that led to the production of prebiotic molecules in various environments is critical for establishing the inventory of ingredients from which life originated on Earth, assuming that the abiotic production of molecules ultimately influenced the selection of molecules from which life emerged. In 2019, scientists reported detecting, for the first time, sugar molecules, including ribose, in meteorites, suggesting that chemical processes on asteroids can produce some fundamentally essential bio- ingredients important to life, and supporting the notion of an RNA world prior to a DNA-based origin of life on Earth, and possibly, as well, the notion of panspermia.  Chemical synthesis in the laboratory As early as the 1860s, experiments have demonstrated that biologically relevant molecules can be produced from interaction of simple carbon sources with abundant inorganic catalysts. =Fox proteinoids= In trying to uncover the intermediate stages of abiogenesis mentioned by Bernal, Sidney Fox in the 1950s and 1960s studied the spontaneous formation of peptide structures (small chains of amino acids) under conditions that might plausibly have existed early in Earth's history. In one of his experiments, he allowed amino acids to dry out as if puddled in a warm, dry spot in prebiotic conditions: In an experiment to set suitable conditions for life to form, Fox collected volcanic material from a cinder cone in Hawaii. He discovered that the temperature was over 100 C just beneath the surface of the cinder cone, and suggested that this might have been the environment in which life was created‚Äîmolecules could have formed and then been washed through the loose volcanic ash into the sea. He placed lumps of lava over amino acids derived from methane, ammonia and water, sterilized all materials, and baked the lava over the amino acids for a few hours in a glass oven. A brown, sticky substance formed over the surface, and when the lava was drenched in sterilized water, a thick, brown liquid leached out. He found that, as they dried, the amino acids formed long, often cross-linked, thread-like, submicroscopic polypeptide molecules. =Sugars= In particular, experiments by Butlerov (the formose reaction) showed that tetroses, pentoses, and hexoses are produced when formaldehyde is heated under basic conditions with divalent metal ions like calcium. The reaction was scrutinized and subsequently proposed to be autocatalytic by Breslow in 1959. =Nucleobases= Similar experiments (see below) demonstrate that nucleobases like guanine and adenine could be synthesized from simple carbon and nitrogen sources like hydrogen cyanide and ammonia. Formamide produces all four ribonucleotides and other biological molecules when warmed in the presence of various terrestrial minerals. Formamide is ubiquitous in the Universe, produced by the reaction of water and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). It has several advantages as a biotic precursor, including the ability to easily become concentrated through the evaporation of water. Although HCN is poisonous, it only affects aerobic organisms (eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria), which did not yet exist. It can play roles in other chemical processes as well, such as the synthesis of the amino acid glycine. In March 2015, NASA scientists reported that, for the first time, complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine and thymine, have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like PAHs, the most carbon-rich chemical found in the Universe, may have been formed in red giant stars or in interstellar dust and gas clouds. A group of Czech scientists reported that all four RNA-bases may be synthesized from formamide in the course of high-energy density events like extraterrestrial impacts. =Use of high temperature= In 1961, it was shown that the nucleic acid purine base adenine can be formed by heating aqueous ammonium cyanide solutions. =Use of low (freezing) temperature= Other pathways for synthesizing bases from inorganic materials were also reported. Orgel and colleagues have shown that freezing temperatures are advantageous for the synthesis of purines, due to the concentrating effect for key precursors such as hydrogen cyanide. Research by Miller and colleagues suggested that while adenine and guanine require freezing conditions for synthesis, cytosine and uracil may require boiling temperatures. Research by the Miller group notes the formation of seven different amino acids and 11 types of nucleobases in ice when ammonia and cyanide were left in a freezer from 1972 to 1997. Other work demonstrated the formation of s-triazines (alternative nucleobases), pyrimidines (including cytosine and uracil), and adenine from urea solutions subjected to freeze-thaw cycles under a reductive atmosphere (with spark discharges as an energy source). The explanation given for the unusual speed of these reactions at such a low temperature is eutectic freezing. As an ice crystal forms, it stays pure: only molecules of water join the growing crystal, while impurities like salt or cyanide are excluded. These impurities become crowded in microscopic pockets of liquid within the ice, and this crowding causes the molecules to collide more often. Mechanistic exploration using quantum chemical methods provide a more detailed understanding of some of the chemical processes involved in chemical evolution, and a partial answer to the fundamental question of molecular biogenesis. =Use of less-reducing gas in Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment= At the time of the Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment, scientific consensus was that the early Earth had a reducing atmosphere with compounds relatively rich in hydrogen and poor in oxygen (e.g., CH4 and NH3 as opposed to CO2 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)). However, current scientific consensus describes the primitive atmosphere as either weakly reducing or neutral (see also Oxygen Catastrophe). Such an atmosphere would diminish both the amount and variety of amino acids that could be produced, although studies that include iron and carbonate minerals (thought present in early oceans) in the experimental conditions have again produced a diverse array of amino acids. Other scientific research has focused on two other potential reducing environments: outer space and deep-sea thermal vents. =Synthesis based on hydrogen cyanide= A research project completed in 2015 by John Sutherland and others found that a network of reactions beginning with hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide, in streams of water irradiated by UV light, could produce the chemical components of proteins and lipids, as well as those of RNA, while not producing a wide range of other compounds. The researchers used the term \\"cyanosulfidic\\" to describe this network of reactions. =Issues during laboratory synthesis= The spontaneous formation of complex polymers from abiotically generated monomers under the conditions posited by the \\"soup\\" theory is not at all a straightforward process. Besides the necessary basic organic monomers, compounds that would have prohibited the formation of polymers were also formed in high concentration during the Miller‚ÄìUrey and Joan Or√≥ experiments. The Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment, for example, produces many substances that would react with the amino acids or terminate their coupling into peptide chains.  Autocatalysis  Autocatalysts are substances that catalyze the production of themselves and therefore are \\"molecular replicators.\\" The simplest self-replicating chemical systems are autocatalytic, and typically contain three components: a product molecule and two precursor molecules. The product molecule joins together the precursor molecules, which in turn produce more product molecules from more precursor molecules. The product molecule catalyzes the reaction by providing a complementary template that binds to the precursors, thus bringing them together. Such systems have been demonstrated both in biological macromolecules and in small organic molecules. Systems that do not proceed by template mechanisms, such as the self-reproduction of micelles and vesicles, have also been observed. It has been proposed that life initially arose as autocatalytic chemical networks. British ethologist Richard Dawkins wrote about autocatalysis as a potential explanation for the origin of life in his 2004 book The Ancestor's Tale. In his book, Dawkins cites experiments performed by Julius Rebek and his colleagues in which they combined amino adenosine and pentafluorophenyl esters with the autocatalyst amino adenosine triacid ester (AATE). One product was a variant of AATE, which catalyzed the synthesis of themselves. This experiment demonstrated the possibility that autocatalysts could exhibit competition within a population of entities with heredity, which could be interpreted as a rudimentary form of natural selection.  Encapsulation: morphology   Encapsulation without a membrane  =Oparin's coacervate= =Membraneless polyester droplets= Researchers Tony Jia and Kuhan Chandru have proposed that membraneless polyesters droplets could have been significant in the Origins of Life. Given the \\"messy\\" nature of prebiotic chemistry, the spontaneous generation of these combinatorial droplets may have played a role in early cellularization before the innovation of lipid vesicles. Protein function within and RNA function in the presence of certain polyester droplets was shown to be preserved within the droplets. Additionally, the droplets have scaffolding ability, by allowing lipids to assemble around them that may have prevented leakage of genetic materials.  Proteinoid microspheres  Fox observed in the 1960s that the proteinoids that he had synthesized could form cell-like structures that have been named \\"proteinoid microspheres\\". The amino acids had combined to form proteinoids, and the proteinoids had combined to form small globules that Fox called \\"microspheres\\". His proteinoids were not cells, although they formed clumps and chains reminiscent of cyanobacteria, but they contained no functional nucleic acids or any encoded information. Based upon such experiments, Colin Pittendrigh stated in 1967 that \\"laboratories will be creating a living cell within ten years,\\" a remark that reflected the typical contemporary naivety about the complexity of cell structures.  Lipid world  The lipid world theory postulates that the first self-replicating object was lipid-like. It is known that phospholipids form lipid bilayers in water while under agitation‚Äîthe same structure as in cell membranes. These molecules were not present on early Earth, but other amphiphilic long-chain molecules also form membranes. Furthermore, these bodies may expand (by insertion of additional lipids), and under excessive expansion may undergo spontaneous splitting which preserves the same size and composition of lipids in the two progenies. The main idea in this theory is that the molecular composition of the lipid bodies is the preliminary way for information storage, and evolution led to the appearance of polymer entities such as RNA or DNA that may store information favourably. Studies on vesicles from potentially prebiotic amphiphiles have so far been limited to systems containing one or two types of amphiphiles. This in contrast to the output of simulated prebiotic chemical reactions, which typically produce very heterogeneous mixtures of compounds. Within the hypothesis of a lipid bilayer membrane composed of a mixture of various distinct amphiphilic compounds there is the opportunity of a huge number of theoretically possible combinations in the arrangements of these amphiphiles in the membrane. Among all these potential combinations, a specific local arrangement of the membrane would have favoured the constitution of a hypercycle, actually a positive feedback composed of two mutual catalysts represented by a membrane site and a specific compound trapped in the vesicle. Such site/compound pairs are transmissible to the daughter vesicles leading to the emergence of distinct lineages of vesicles which would have allowed Darwinian natural selection. Special Issue: \\"Origin of Life 2011\\"  Protocells  The three main structures phospholipids form spontaneously in solution: the liposome (a closed bilayer), the micelle and the bilayer. A protocell is a self-organized, self-ordered, spherical collection of lipids proposed as a stepping-stone to the origin of life. A central question in evolution is how simple protocells first arose and differed in reproductive contribution to the following generation driving the evolution of life. Although a functional protocell has not yet been achieved in a laboratory setting, there are scientists who think the goal is well within reach. Self-assembled vesicles are essential components of primitive cells. The second law of thermodynamics requires that the universe move in a direction in which entropy increases, yet life is distinguished by its great degree of organization. Therefore, a boundary is needed to separate life processes from non-living matter. Researchers Irene Chen and Szostak amongst others, suggest that simple physicochemical properties of elementary protocells can give rise to essential cellular behaviours, including primitive forms of differential reproduction competition and energy storage. Such cooperative interactions between the membrane and its encapsulated contents could greatly simplify the transition from simple replicating molecules to true cells. Furthermore, competition for membrane molecules would favour stabilized membranes, suggesting a selective advantage for the evolution of cross-linked fatty acids and even the phospholipids of today. Such micro-encapsulation would allow for metabolism within the membrane, the exchange of small molecules but the prevention of passage of large substances across it. The main advantages of encapsulation include the increased solubility of the contained cargo within the capsule and the storage of energy in the form of an electrochemical gradient. A 2012 study led by Mulkidjanian of the University of Osnabr√ºck, suggests that inland pools of condensed and cooled geothermal vapor have the ideal characteristics for the origin of life. Scientists confirmed in 2002 that by adding a montmorillonite clay to a solution of fatty acid micelles (lipid spheres), the clay sped up the rate of vesicles formation 100-fold. Furthermore, recent studies have found that the repeated actions of dehydration and rehydration trapped biomolecules like RNA inside the lipid protocells found within hot springs and providing the necessary preconditions for evolution by natural selection.  Lipid vesicles formation in fresh water  Bruce Damer and David Deamer have come to the conclusion that cell membranes cannot be formed in salty seawater, and must therefore have originated in freshwater. Before the continents formed, the only dry land on Earth would be volcanic islands, where rainwater would form ponds where lipids could form the first stages towards cell membranes. These predecessors of true cells are assumed to have behaved more like a superorganism rather than individual structures, where the porous membranes would house molecules which would leak out and enter other protocells. Only when true cells had evolved would they gradually adapt to saltier environments and enter the ocean.  Vesicles consisting of mixtures of RNA-like biochemicals  Another protocell model is the Jeewanu. First synthesized in 1963 from simple minerals and basic organics while exposed to sunlight, it is still reported to have some metabolic capabilities, the presence of semipermeable membrane, amino acids, phospholipids, carbohydrates and RNA-like molecules. However, the nature and properties of the Jeewanu remains to be clarified. Electrostatic interactions induced by short, positively charged, hydrophobic peptides containing 7 amino acids in length or fewer, can attach RNA to a vesicle membrane, the basic cell membrane.

In 1879 William Turner Thiselton-Dyer referred to this in a paper \\"On spontaneous generation and evolution\\". On 1 February 1871 Charles Darwin wrote about these publications to Joseph Hooker, and set out his own speculation, suggesting that the original spark of life may have begun in a > warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, > heat, electricity, , present, that a compound was chemically formed ready to > undergo still more complex changes. He went on to explain that > at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, > which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed. : It is often said that all the conditions for the first production of a living organism are now present, which could ever have been present. But if (and oh! what a big if!) we could conceive in some warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, , present, that a compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed. ‚Äî Darwin, 1 February 1871 More recent studies, in 2017, support the notion that life may have begun right after the Earth was formed as RNA molecules emerging from \\"warm little ponds\\". Volcanic hot springs and hydrothermal vents, shallow or deep Martin Brazier has shown that early micro-fossils came from a hot world of gases such as methane, ammonia, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide, which are toxic to much current life. M.D> Brasier (2012), \\"Secret Chambers: The Inside Story of Cells and Complex Life\\" (Oxford Uni Press), p.298 Another analysis of the conventional threefold tree of life shows thermophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea are closest to the root, suggesting that life may have evolved in a hot environment.Ward, Peter & Kirschvink, Joe, op cit, p. 42 Deep sea hydrothermal vents Deep-sea hydrothermal vent or black smoker The deep sea vent, or alkaline hydrothermal vent, theory posits that life may have begun at submarine hydrothermal vents, Martin and Russell have suggested > that life evolved in structured iron monosulphide precipitates in a seepage > site hydrothermal mound at a redox, pH, and temperature gradient between > sulphide-rich hydrothermal fluid and iron(II)-containing waters of the > Hadean ocean floor.

These form where hydrogen-rich fluids emerge from below the sea floor, as a result of serpentinization of ultra-mafic olivine with seawater and a pH interface with carbon dioxide-rich ocean water. The vents form a sustained chemical energy source derived from redox reactions, in which electron donors (molecular hydrogen) react with electron acceptors (carbon dioxide); see Iron‚Äìsulfur world theory. These are highly exothermic reactions. Russell demonstrated that alkaline vents created an abiogenic proton motive force (PMF) chemiosmotic gradient, in which conditions are ideal for an abiogenic hatchery for life. Their microscopic compartments \\"provide a natural means of concentrating organic molecules,\\" composed of iron-sulfur minerals such as mackinawite, endowed these mineral cells with the catalytic properties envisaged by G√ºnter W√§chtersh√§user. This movement of ions across the membrane depends on a combination of two factors: # Diffusion force caused by concentration gradient‚Äîall particles including ions tend to diffuse from higher concentration to lower. # Electrostatic force caused by electrical potential gradient‚Äîcations like protons H+ tend to diffuse down the electrical potential, anions in the opposite direction. These two gradients taken together can be expressed as an electrochemical gradient, providing energy for abiogenic synthesis. The proton motive force can be described as the measure of the potential energy stored as a combination of proton and voltage gradients across a membrane (differences in proton concentration and electrical potential). Szostak suggested that geothermal activity provides greater opportunities for the origination of life in open lakes where there is a buildup of minerals. In 2010, based on spectral analysis of sea and hot mineral water, Ignat Ignatov and Oleg Mosin demonstrated that life may have predominantly originated in hot mineral water. The hot mineral water that contains bicarbonate and calcium ions has the most optimal range. This case is similar to the origin of life in hydrothermal vents, but with bicarbonate and calcium ions in hot water. This water has a pH of 9‚Äì11 and is possible to have the reactions in seawater. According to Melvin Calvin, certain reactions of condensation-dehydration of amino acids and nucleotides in individual blocks of peptides and nucleic acids can take place in the primary hydrosphere with pH 9‚Äì11 at a later evolutionary stage. Some of these compounds like hydrocyanic acid (HCN) have been proven in the experiments of Miller. This is the environment in which the stromatolites have been created. David Ward of Montana State University described the formation of stromatolites in hot mineral water at the Yellowstone National Park. Stromatolites survive in hot mineral water and in proximity to areas with volcanic activity. Processes have evolved in the sea near geysers of hot mineral water. In 2011, Tadashi Sugawara from the University of Tokyo created a protocell in hot water. Experimental research and computer modelling suggest that the surfaces of mineral particles inside hydrothermal vents have catalytic properties similar to those of enzymes and are able to create simple organic molecules, such as methanol (CH3OH) and formic, acetic and pyruvic acid out of the dissolved CO2 in the water. The research reported above by Martin in 2016 supports the thesis that life arose at hydrothermal vents, that spontaneous chemistry in the Earth's crust driven by rock‚Äìwater interactions at disequilibrium thermodynamically underpinned life's origin and that the founding lineages of the archaea and bacteria were H2-dependent autotrophs that used CO2 as their terminal acceptor in energy metabolism. Martin suggests, based upon this evidence that LUCA \\"may have depended heavily on the geothermal energy of the vent to survive\\".Nature, Vol 535, 28 July 2016. p.468  Fluctuating hydrothermal pools on volcanic islands or proto-continents  Mulkidjanian and co-authors think that the marine environments did not provide the ionic balance and composition universally found in cells, as well as of ions required by essential proteins and ribozymes found in virtually all living organisms, especially with respect to K+/Na+ ratio, Mn2+, Zn2+ and phosphate concentrations. The only known environments that mimic the needed conditions on Earth are found in terrestrial hydrothermal pools fed by steam vents. Additionally, mineral deposits in these environments under an anoxic atmosphere would have suitable pH (as opposed to current pools in an oxygenated atmosphere), contain precipitates of sulfide minerals that block harmful UV radiation, have wetting/drying cycles that concentrate substrate solutions to concentrations amenable to spontaneous formation of polymers of nucleic acids, polyesters and depsipeptides, both by chemical reactions in the hydrothermal environment, as well as by exposure to UV light during transport from vents to adjacent pools. Their hypothesized pre-biotic environments are similar to the deep-oceanic vent environments most commonly hypothesized, but add additional components that help explain peculiarities found in reconstructions of the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) of all living organisms. Col√≠n-Garc√≠a et al. (2016) discuss the advantages and disadvantages of hydrothermal vents as primitive environments. They mention the exergonic reactions in such systems could have been a source of free energy that promoted chemical reactions, additional to their high mineralogical diversity which implies the induction of important chemical gradients, thus favoring the interaction between electron donors and acceptors. Col√≠n-Garc√≠a et al. (2016) also summarize a set of experiments proposed to test the role of hydrothermal vents in prebiotic synthesis. Volcanic ash in the ocean Geoffrey W. Hoffmann has argued that a complex nucleation event as the origin of life involving both polypeptides and nucleic acid is compatible with the time and space available in the primitive oceans of Earth Hoffmann suggests that volcanic ash may provide the many random shapes needed in the postulated complex nucleation event. This aspect of the theory can be tested experimentally.  Gold's deep-hot biosphere  In the 1970s, Thomas Gold proposed the theory that life first developed not on the surface of the Earth, but several kilometers below the surface. It is claimed that the discovery of microbial life below the surface of another body in our Solar System would lend significant credence to this theory. Gold also asserted that a trickle of food from a deep, unreachable, source is needed for survival because life arising in a puddle of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct. Gold's theory is that the flow of such food is due to out- gassing of primordial methane from the Earth's mantle; more conventional explanations of the food supply of deep microbes (away from sedimentary carbon compounds) is that the organisms subsist on hydrogen released by an interaction between water and (reduced) iron compounds in rocks.  Radioactive beach hypothesis  Zachary Adam claims that tidal processes that occurred during a time when the Moon was much closer may have concentrated grains of uranium and other radioactive elements at the high-water mark on primordial beaches, where they may have been responsible for generating life's building blocks. According to computer models, a deposit of such radioactive materials could show the same self-sustaining nuclear reaction as that found in the Oklo uranium ore seam in Gabon. Such radioactive beach sand might have provided sufficient energy to generate organic molecules, such as amino acids and sugars from acetonitrile in water. Radioactive monazite material also has released soluble phosphate into the regions between sand-grains, making it biologically \\"accessible.\\" Thus amino acids, sugars, and soluble phosphates might have been produced simultaneously, according to Adam. Radioactive actinides, left behind in some concentration by the reaction, might have formed part of organometallic complexes. These complexes could have been important early catalysts to living processes. John Parnell has suggested that such a process could provide part of the \\"crucible of life\\" in the early stages of any early wet rocky planet, so long as the planet is large enough to have generated a system of plate tectonics which brings radioactive minerals to the surface. As the early Earth is thought to have had many smaller plates, it might have provided a suitable environment for such processes.  Origin of metabolism: physiology  Different forms of life with variable origin processes may have appeared quasi-simultaneously in the early history of Earth. The other forms may be extinct (having left distinctive fossils through their different biochemistry‚Äîe.g., hypothetical types of biochemistry). It has been proposed that: > The first organisms were self-replicating iron-rich clays which fixed carbon > dioxide into oxalic and other dicarboxylic acids. This system of replicating > clays and their metabolic phenotype then evolved into the sulfide rich > region of the hotspring acquiring the ability to fix nitrogen. Finally > phosphate was incorporated into the evolving system which allowed the > synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. If biosynthesis recapitulates > biopoiesis, then the synthesis of amino acids preceded the synthesis of the > purine and pyrimidine bases. Furthermore, the polymerization of the amino > acid thioesters into polypeptides preceded the directed polymerization of > amino acid esters by polynucleotides. Metabolism-like reactions could have occurred naturally in early oceans, before the first organisms evolved. Metabolism may predate the origin of life, which may have evolved from the chemical conditions in the earliest oceans. Reconstructions in laboratories show that some of these reactions can produce RNA, and some others resemble two essential reaction cascades of metabolism: glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, that provide essential precursors for nucleic acids, amino acids and lipids.  Clay hypothesis  Montmorillonite, an abundant clay, is a catalyst for the polymerization of RNA and for the formation of membranes from lipids. A model for the origin of life using clay was forwarded by Alexander Cairns-Smith in 1985 and explored as a plausible mechanism by several scientists. The clay hypothesis postulates that complex organic molecules arose gradually on pre-existing, non-organic replication surfaces of silicate crystals in solution. At the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, James Ferris' studies have also confirmed that montmorillonite clay minerals catalyze the formation of RNA in aqueous solution, by joining nucleotides to form longer chains. In 2007, Bart Kahr from the University of Washington and colleagues reported their experiments that tested the idea that crystals can act as a source of transferable information, using crystals of potassium hydrogen phthalate. \\"Mother\\" crystals with imperfections were cleaved and used as seeds to grow \\"daughter\\" crystals from solution. They then examined the distribution of imperfections in the new crystals and found that the imperfections in the mother crystals were reproduced in the daughters, but the daughter crystals also had many additional imperfections. For gene-like behavior to be observed, the quantity of inheritance of these imperfections should have exceeded that of the mutations in the successive generations, but it did not. Thus Kahr concluded that the crystals \\"were not faithful enough to store and transfer information from one generation to the next.\\" *  Iron‚Äìsulfur world  In the 1980s, G√ºnter W√§chtersh√§user, encouraged and supported by Karl Popper, postulated his iron‚Äìsulfur world, a theory of the evolution of pre-biotic chemical pathways as the starting point in the evolution of life. It systematically traces today's biochemistry to primordial reactions which provide alternative pathways to the synthesis of organic building blocks from simple gaseous compounds. In contrast to the classical Miller experiments, which depend on external sources of energy (simulated lightning, ultraviolet irradiation), \\"W√§chtersh√§user systems\\" come with a built-in source of energy: sulfides of iron (iron pyrite) and other minerals. The energy released from redox reactions of these metal sulfides is available for the synthesis of organic molecules, and such systems may have evolved into autocatalytic sets constituting self-replicating, metabolically active entities predating the life forms known today. Experiments with such sulfides in an aqueous environment at 100 ¬∞C produced a relatively small yield of dipeptides (0.4% to 12.4%) and a smaller yield of tripeptides (0.10%) although under the same conditions, dipeptides were quickly broken down. Several models reject the self-replication of a \\"naked-gene\\", postulating instead the emergence of a primitive metabolism providing a safe environment for the later emergence of RNA replication. The centrality of the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle) to energy production in aerobic organisms, and in drawing in carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions in biosynthesis of complex organic chemicals, suggests that it was one of the first parts of the metabolism to evolve. Concordantly, geochemist Russell has proposed that \\"the purpose of life is to hydrogenate carbon dioxide\\" (as part of a \\"metabolism-first,\\" rather than a \\"genetics- first,\\" scenario). Physicist Jeremy England has proposed that life was inevitable from general thermodynamic considerations: > ... when a group of atoms is driven by an external source of energy (like > the sun or chemical fuel) and surrounded by a heat bath (like the ocean or > atmosphere), it will often gradually restructure itself in order to > dissipate increasingly more energy. This could mean that under certain > conditions, matter inexorably acquires the key physical attribute associated > with life. One of the earliest incarnations of this idea was put forward in 1924 with Oparin's notion of primitive self-replicating vesicles which predated the discovery of the structure of DNA. Variants in the 1980s and 1990s include W√§chtersh√§user's iron‚Äìsulfur world theory and models introduced by Christian de Duve based on the chemistry of thioesters. More abstract and theoretical arguments for the plausibility of the emergence of metabolism without the presence of genes include a mathematical model introduced by Freeman Dyson in the early 1980s and Stuart Kauffman's notion of collectively autocatalytic sets, discussed later that decade. Orgel summarized his analysis by stating, > There is at present no reason to expect that multistep cycles such as the > reductive citric acid cycle will self-organize on the surface of FeS/FeS2 or > some other mineral.\\" It is possible that another type of metabolic pathway was used at the beginning of life. For example, instead of the reductive citric acid cycle, the \\"open\\" acetyl-CoA pathway (another one of the five recognized ways of carbon dioxide fixation in nature today) would be compatible with the idea of self-organization on a metal sulfide surface. The key enzyme of this pathway, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase, harbors mixed nickel-iron- sulfur clusters in its reaction centers and catalyzes the formation of acetyl- CoA (similar to acetyl-thiol) in a single step. There are increasing concerns, however, that prebiotic thiolated and thioester compounds are thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable to accumulate in presumed prebiotic conditions (i.e. hydrothermal vents). It has also been proposed that cysteine and homocysteine may have reacted with nitriles resulting from the Stecker reaction, readily forming catalytic thiol-reach poplypeptides.  Zinc-world hypothesis  The zinc world (Zn-world) theory of Mulkidjanian is an extension of W√§chtersh√§user's pyrite hypothesis. W√§chtersh√§user based his theory of the initial chemical processes leading to informational molecules (RNA, peptides) on a regular mesh of electric charges at the surface of pyrite that may have facilitated the primeval polymerization by attracting reactants and arranging them appropriately relative to each other. The Zn-world theory specifies and differentiates further. Hydrothermal fluids rich in H2S interacting with cold primordial ocean (or Darwin's \\"warm little pond\\") water leads to the precipitation of metal sulfide particles. Oceanic vent systems and other hydrothermal systems have a zonal structure reflected in ancient volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits (VMS) of hydrothermal origin. They reach many kilometers in diameter and date back to the Archean Eon. Most abundant are pyrite (FeS2), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), and sphalerite (ZnS), with additions of galena (PbS) and alabandite (MnS). ZnS and MnS have a unique ability to store radiation energy, e.g. from UV light. During the relevant time window of the origins of replicating molecules, the primordial atmospheric pressure was high enough (>100 bar, about 100 atmospheres) to precipitate near the Earth's surface, and UV irradiation was 10 to 100 times more intense than now; hence the unique photosynthetic properties mediated by ZnS provided just the right energy conditions to energize the synthesis of informational and metabolic molecules and the selection of photostable nucleobases. The Zn-world theory has been further filled out with experimental and theoretical evidence for the ionic constitution of the interior of the first proto-cells before archaea, bacteria and proto-eukaryotes evolved. Archibald Macallum noted the resemblance of body fluids such as blood and lymph to seawater; however, the inorganic composition of all cells differ from that of modern seawater, which led Mulkidjanian and colleagues to reconstruct the \\"hatcheries\\" of the first cells combining geochemical analysis with phylogenomic scrutiny of the inorganic ion requirements of universal components of modern cells. The authors conclude that ubiquitous, and by inference primordial, proteins and functional systems show affinity to and functional requirement for K+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and . Geochemical reconstruction shows that the ionic composition conducive to the origin of cells could not have existed in what we today call marine settings but is compatible with emissions of vapor-dominated zones of what we today call inland geothermal systems. Under the oxygen depleted, CO2-dominated primordial atmosphere, the chemistry of water condensates and exhalations near geothermal fields would resemble the internal milieu of modern cells. Therefore, the precellular stages of evolution may have taken place in shallow \\"Darwin ponds\\" lined with porous silicate minerals mixed with metal sulfides and enriched in K+, Zn2+, and phosphorus compounds.For a deeper integrative version of this hypothesis, see in particular , interconnecting the \\"Two RNA worlds\\" concept and other detailed aspects; and Other abiogenesis scenarios We define a scenario as a set of related concepts pertinent to the origin of life that is or has been investigated. The concepts related to the Iron-Sulfur world can be considered as a scenario. We consider some other scenarios that may partially overlap with scenarios discussed above or with each other. Chemical pathways described by computer In September 2020, chemists described, for the first time, possible chemical pathways from nonliving prebiotic chemicals to complex biochemicals that could give rise to living organisms, based on a new computer program named ALLCHEMY. The hypercycle In the early 1970s, Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster examined the transient stages between the molecular chaos and a self-replicating hypercycle in a prebiotic soup. In a hypercycle, the information storing system (possibly RNA) produces an enzyme, which catalyzes the formation of another information system, in sequence until the product of the last aids in the formation of the first information system. Mathematically treated, hypercycles could create quasispecies, which through natural selection entered into a form of Darwinian evolution. A boost to hypercycle theory was the discovery of ribozymes capable of catalyzing their own chemical reactions. The hypercycle theory requires the existence of complex biochemicals, such as nucleotides, which do not form under the conditions proposed by the Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment. Organic pigments in dissipative structures In his \\"Thermodynamic Dissipation Theory of the Origin and Evolution of Life\\", Karo Michaelian has taken the insight of Boltzmann and the work of Prigogine to its ultimate consequences regarding the origin of life. This theory postulates that the hallmark of the origin and evolution of life is the microscopic dissipative structuring of organic pigments and their proliferation over the entire Earth surface. Present day life augments the entropy production of Earth in its solar environment by dissipating ultraviolet and visible photons into heat through organic pigments in water. This heat then catalyzes a host of secondary dissipative processes such as the water cycle, ocean and wind currents, hurricanes, etc. Michaelian argues that if the thermodynamic function of life today is to produce entropy through photon dissipation in organic pigments, then this probably was its function at its very beginnings. It turns out that both RNA and DNA when in water solution are very strong absorbers and extremely rapid dissipaters of ultraviolet light within the 230‚Äì290 nm wavelength (UV-C) region, which is a part of the Sun's spectrum that could have penetrated the prebiotic atmosphere.Sagan, C. (1973) Ultraviolet Selection Pressure on the Earliest Organisms, J. Theor. Biol., 39, 195‚Äì200. In fact, not only RNA and DNA, but many fundamental molecules of life (those common to all three domains of life) are also pigments that absorb in the UV-C, and many of these also have a chemical affinity to RNA and DNA. Nucleic acids may thus have acted as acceptor molecules to the UV-C photon excited antenna pigment donor molecules by providing an ultrafast channel for dissipation. Michaelian has shown using the formalism of non-linear irreversible thermodynamics that there would have existed during the Archean a thermodynamic imperative to the abiogenic UV-C photochemical synthesis and proliferation of these pigments over the entire Earth surface if they acted as catalysts to augment the dissipation of the solar photons. By the end of the Archean, with life-induced ozone dissipating UV-C light in the Earth's upper atmosphere, it would have become ever more improbable for a completely new life to emerge that did not rely on the complex metabolic pathways already existing since now the free energy in the photons arriving at Earth's surface would have been insufficient for direct breaking and remaking of covalent bonds. It has been suggested, however, that such changes in the surface flux of ultraviolet radiation due to geophysical events affecting the atmosphere could have been what promoted the development of complexity in life based on existing metabolic pathways, for example during the Cambrian explosion Some of the most difficult problems concerning the origin of life, such as enzyme-less replication of RNA and DNA, homochirality of the fundamental molecules, and the origin of information encoding in RNA and DNA, also find an explanation within the same dissipative thermodynamic framework by considering the probable existence of a relation between primordial replication and UV-C photon dissipation. Michaelian suggests that it is erroneous to expect to describe the emergence, proliferation, or even evolution, of life without overwhelming reference to entropy production through the dissipation of a generalized thermodynamic potential, in particular, the prevailing solar photon flux. Protein amyloid A new origin-of-life theory based on self- replicating beta-sheet structures has been put forward by Maury in 2009. The theory suggest that self-replicating and self-assembling catalytic amyloids were the first informational polymers in a primitive pre-RNA world. The main arguments for the amyloid hypothesis is based on the structural stability, autocatalytic and catalytic properties, and evolvability of beta-sheet based informational systems. Such systems are also error correcting and chiroselective.  Fluctuating salinity: dilute and dry-down  Theories of abiogenesis seldom address the caveat raised by Harold Blum:Blum, H.F. (1957). On the origin of self-replicating systems. In Rhythmic and Synthetic Processes in Growth, ed. Rudnick, D., pp. 155‚Äì170. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ. if the key informational elements of life ‚Äì proto-nucleic acid chains ‚Äì spontaneously form duplex structures, then there is no way to dissociate them. > Somewhere in this cycle work must be done, which means that free energy must > be expended. If the parts assemble themselves on a template spontaneously, > work has to be done to take the replica off; or, if the replica comes off > the template of its own accord, work must be done to put the parts on in the > first place. The Oparin‚ÄìHaldane conjecture addresses the formation, but not the dissociation, of nucleic acid polymers and duplexes. However, nucleic acids are unusual because, in the absence of counterions (low salt) to neutralize the high charges on opposing phosphate groups, the nucleic acid duplex dissociates into single chains. Early tides, driven by a close moon, could have generated rapid cycles of dilution (high tide, low salt) and concentration (dry-down at low tide, high salt) that exclusively promoted the replication of nucleic acids through a process dubbed tidal chain reaction (TCR). This theory has been criticized on the grounds that early tides may not have been so rapid, although regression from current values requires an Earth‚ÄìMoon juxtaposition at around two Ga, for which there is no evidence, and early tides may have been approximately every seven hours. Another critique is that only 2‚Äì3% of the Earth's crust may have been exposed above the sea until late in terrestrial evolution. The TCR (tidal chain reaction) theory has mechanistic advantages over thermal association/dissociation at deep-sea vents because TCR requires that chain assembly (template-driven polymerization) takes place during the dry-down phase, when precursors are most concentrated, whereas thermal cycling needs polymerization to take place during the cold phase, when the rate of chain assembly is lowest and precursors are likely to be more dilute.  A first protein that condenses substrates during thermal cycling: thermosynthesis Convection cells in fluid placed in a gravity field are selforganizing and enable thermal cycling of the suspended contents in the fluid such as protocells containing protoenzymes that work on thermal cycling. Emergence of chemiosmotic machinery Today's bioenergetic process of fermentation is carried out by either the aforementioned citric acid cycle or the Acetyl-CoA pathway, both of which have been connected to the primordial Iron‚Äìsulfur world. In a different approach, the thermosynthesis hypothesis considers the bioenergetic process of chemiosmosis, which plays an essential role in cellular respiration and photosynthesis, more basal than fermentation: the ATP synthase enzyme, which sustains chemiosmosis, is proposed as the currently extant enzyme most closely related to the first metabolic process. First life needed an energy source to bring about the condensation reaction that yielded the peptide bonds of proteins and the phosphodiester bonds of RNA. In a generalization and thermal variation of the binding change mechanism of today's ATP synthase, the \\"first protein\\" would have bound substrates (peptides, phosphate, nucleosides, RNA 'monomers') and condensed them to a reaction product that remained bound until it was released after a temperature change by a thermal unfolding. The primordial first protein would therefore have strongly resembled the beta subunits of the ATP synthase alpha/beta subunits of today's F1 moiety in the FoF1 ATP synthase. Note however that today's enzymes function during isothermal conditions, whereas the hypothetical first protein worked on and during thermal cycling. The energy source under the thermosynthesis hypothesis was thermal cycling, the result of suspension of protocells in a convection current, as is plausible in a volcanic hot spring; the convection accounts for the self-organization and dissipative structure required in any origin of life model. The still ubiquitous role of thermal cycling in germination and cell division is considered a relic of primordial thermosynthesis. By phosphorylating cell membrane lipids, this first protein gave a selective advantage to the lipid protocell that contained the protein. This protein also synthesized a library of many proteins, of which only a minute fraction had thermosynthesis capabilities. As proposed by Dyson, it propagated functionally: it made daughters with similar capabilities, but it did not copy itself. Functioning daughters consisted of different amino acid sequences. Whereas the iron‚Äìsulfur world identifies a circular pathway as the most simple, the thermosynthesis hypothesis does not even invoke a pathway: ATP synthase's binding change mechanism resembles a physical adsorption process that yields free energy, rather than a regular enzyme's mechanism, which decreases the free energy. The described first protein may be simple in the sense that is requires only a short sequence of conserved amino acid residues, a sequent sufficient for the appropriate catalytic cleft. In contrast, it has been claimed that the emergence of cyclic systems of protein catalysts such as required by fermentation is implausible because of the length of many required sequences.  Pre-RNA world: The ribose issue and its bypass  It is possible that a different type of nucleic acid, such as peptide nucleic acid, threose nucleic acid or glycol nucleic acid, was the first to emerge as a self-reproducing molecule, only later replaced by RNA. Larralde et al., say that > the generally accepted prebiotic synthesis of ribose, the formose reaction, > yields numerous sugars without any selectivity. and they conclude that their > results suggest that the backbone of the first genetic material could not > have contained ribose or other sugars because of their instability. The ester linkage of ribose and phosphoric acid in RNA is known to be prone to hydrolysis. Pyrimidine ribonucleosides and their respective nucleotides have been prebiotically synthesized by a sequence of reactions which by-pass the free sugars, and are assembled in a stepwise fashion by using nitrogenous or oxygenous chemistries. Sutherland has demonstrated high yielding routes to cytidine and uridine ribonucleotides built from small 2 and 3 carbon fragments such as glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, cyanamide and cyanoacetylene. One of the steps in this sequence allows the isolation of enantiopure ribose aminooxazoline if the enantiomeric excess of glyceraldehyde is 60% or greater. This can be viewed as a prebiotic purification step, where the said compound spontaneously crystallized out from a mixture of the other pentose aminooxazolines. Ribose aminooxazoline can then react with cyanoacetylene in a mild and highly efficient manner to give the alpha cytidine ribonucleotide. Photoanomerization with UV light allows for inversion about the 1' anomeric centre to give the correct beta stereochemistry. In 2009 they showed that the same simple building blocks allow access, via phosphate controlled nucleobase elaboration, to 2',3'-cyclic pyrimidine nucleotides directly, which are known to be able to polymerize into RNA. This paper also highlights the possibility for the photo-sanitization of the pyrimidine-2',3'-cyclic phosphates. RNA structures While features of self-organization and self-replication are often considered the hallmark of living systems, there are many instances of abiotic molecules exhibiting such characteristics under proper conditions. Stan Palasek suggested based on a theoretical model that self-assembly of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules can occur spontaneously due to physical factors in hydrothermal vents. Virus self- assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life, as it lends further credence to the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules. Viral origin Recent evidence for a \\"virus first\\" hypothesis, which may support theories of the RNA world, has been suggested. One of the difficulties for the study of the origins of viruses is their high rate of mutation; this is particularly the case in RNA retroviruses like HIV. A 2015 study compared protein fold structures across different branches of the tree of life, where researchers can reconstruct the evolutionary histories of the folds and of the organisms whose genomes code for those folds. They argue that protein folds are better markers of ancient events as their three-dimensional structures can be maintained even as the sequences that code for those begin to change. Thus, the viral protein repertoire retain traces of ancient evolutionary history that can be recovered using advanced bioinformatics approaches. Those researchers think that \\"the prolonged pressure of genome and particle size reduction eventually reduced virocells into modern viruses (identified by the complete loss of cellular makeup), meanwhile other coexisting cellular lineages diversified into modern cells.\\" The data suggest that viruses originated from ancient cells that co-existed with the ancestors of modern cells. These ancient cells likely contained segmented RNA genomes. A computational model (2015) has shown that virus capsids may have originated in the RNA world and that they served as a means of horizontal transfer between replicator communities since these communities could not survive if the number of gene parasites increased, with certain genes being responsible for the formation of these structures and those that favored the survival of self- replicating communities. The displacement of these ancestral genes between cellular organisms could favor the appearance of new viruses during evolution. Viruses retain a replication module inherited from the prebiotic stage since it is absent in cells. So this is evidence that viruses could originate from the RNA world and could also emerge several times in evolution through genetic escape in cells.  RNA world  Jack Szostak A number of hypotheses of formation of RNA have been put forward. , there were difficulties in the explanation of the abiotic synthesis of the nucleotides cytosine and uracil. Subsequent research has shown possible routes of synthesis; for example, formamide produces all four ribonucleotides and other biological molecules when warmed in the presence of various terrestrial minerals. Early cell membranes could have formed spontaneously from proteinoids, which are protein- like molecules produced when amino acid solutions are heated while in the correct concentration of aqueous solution. These are seen to form micro- spheres which are observed to behave similarly to membrane-enclosed compartments. Other possible means of producing more complicated organic molecules include chemical reactions that take place on clay substrates or on the surface of the mineral pyrite. Factors supporting an important role for RNA in early life include its ability to act both to store information and to catalyze chemical reactions (as a ribozyme); its many important roles as an intermediate in the expression of and maintenance of the genetic information (in the form of DNA) in modern organisms; and the ease of chemical synthesis of at least the components of the RNA molecule under the conditions that approximated the early Earth. Relatively short RNA molecules have been synthesized, capable of replication. Such replicase RNA, which functions as both code and catalyst provides its own template upon which copying can occur. Szostak has shown that certain catalytic RNAs can join smaller RNA sequences together, creating the potential for self-replication. If these conditions were present, Darwinian natural selection would favour the proliferation of such autocatalytic sets, to which further functionalities could be added. Such autocatalytic systems of RNA capable of self-sustained replication have been identified. The RNA replication systems, which include two ribozymes that catalyze each other's synthesis, showed a doubling time of the product of about one hour, and were subject to natural selection under the conditions that existed in the experiment. In evolutionary competition experiments, this led to the emergence of new systems which replicated more efficiently. This was the first demonstration of evolutionary adaptation occurring in a molecular genetic system. Depending on the definition, life started when RNA chains began to self-replicate, initiating the three mechanisms of Darwinian selection: heritability, variation of type, and differential reproductive output. The fitness of an RNA replicator (its per capita rate of increase) would likely be a function of its intrinsic adaptive capacities, determined by its nucleotide sequence, and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities may have been: (1) replication with moderate fidelity, giving rise to both heritability while allowing variation of type, (2) resistance to decay, and (3) acquisition of process resources. These capacities would have functioned by means of the folded configurations of the RNA replicators resulting from their nucleotide sequences. Experiments on the origin of life J. Craig Venter Both Eigen and Sol Spiegelman demonstrated that evolution, including replication, variation, and natural selection, can occur in populations of molecules as well as in organisms. Following on from chemical evolution came the initiation of biological evolution, which led to the first cells. No one has yet synthesized a \\"protocell\\" using simple components with the necessary properties of life (the so-called \\"bottom-up-approach\\"). Without such a proof-of-principle, explanations have tended to focus on chemosynthesis. However, some researchers work in this field, notably Steen Rasmussen and Szostak. Others have argued that a \\"top-down approach\\" is more feasible, starting with simple forms of current life. Spiegelman took advantage of natural selection to synthesize the Spiegelman Monster, which had a genome with just 218 nucleotide bases, having deconstructively evolved from a 4500-base bacterial RNA. Eigen built on Spiegelman's work and produced a similar system further degraded to just 48 or 54 nucleotides‚Äîthe minimum required for the binding of the replication enzyme. Craig Venter and others at J. Craig Venter Institute engineered existing prokaryotic cells with progressively fewer genes, attempting to discern at which point the most minimal requirements for life are reached.Coughlan, Andy (2016) \\"Smallest ever genome comes to life: Humans built it but we don't know what a third of its genes actually do\\" (New Scientist 2 April 2016 No 3067)p.6 In October 2018, researchers at McMaster University announced the development of a new technology, called a Planet Simulator, to help study the origin of life on planet Earth and beyond. It consists of a sophisticated climate chamber to study how the building blocks of life were assembled and how these prebiotic molecules transitioned into self-replicating RNA molecules.

Service history World War II service After shakedown in the Gulf of Mexico, Gadsden departed New Orleans 31 March 1945, with a cargo of frozen meat and ammunition for Ulithi, Western Caroline Islands, where she arrived on 11 May after 34 days at sea. From there she proceeded to Kossol Roads, Palau Islands for a 3-day stay marked by alerts for enemy suicide swimmers. She was convoyed by way of Leyte to Morotai Island, Netherlands East Indies, where she spent 3 months as ammunition ship for units of the U.S. 7th Fleet. At times, she serviced six to eight ships a day as she handled much of the ammunition used by fleet units for the Brunei Bay- Balikpapan invasions of Borneo. Gadsden arrived at Leyte 31 July 1945, with about one-third of her cargo. She served as ammunition ship there until announcement of the Japanese capitulation. On 21 August 1945, she departed Leyte on a shuttle cargo run to Subic Bay, Philippine Islands, and Hollandia, New Guinea; thence back to Leyte and was routed onward to Manila, Philippine Islands. Post-war decommissioning Gadsden put to sea from Manila 26 November 1945; transited the Panama Canal 8 January 1946; and reached Norfolk, Virginia, on the 19th for inactivation.

It is thought that Jos√©f was the first of the brothers to go to C√°diz around 1760. He established his workshop in Calle de la Almargura by 1809. A leading member of the C√°diz school, Jos√©f, followed very closely all the innovations that Francisco Sanguino had introduced, but with the additional development of doming the soundboard with the struts, an approach that later makers such as Jose Recio, Antonio de Torres, and Francisco Gonzales also adopted. Pag√©s started with systems of three braces, like the early guitars of Sanguino and Benedid; his later instruments used five. His guitars greatly influenced Louis Panormo, who used similar fan strutting designs and similar proportions for the body of the guitar. The great Spanish composer and guitarist Fernando Sor thought highly of Pag√©s's guitars, stating 'The guitars to which I have always given preference are those of Alonso of Madrid, Pag√©s and Benediz of C√°diz, Joseph and Manuel Martinez of Malaga...'

Later, he assisted Huang Xing to draft the army's military law. In 1930, he co-founded Beiping National Medical College along with Xiao Longwen and Kong Bohua; that school closed in 1944. Just two years after Beiping National Medical College had been founded, Shi had a disagreement with Kong about the school's direction, and left to establish the North China National Medical Academy. The Beijing School for the Further Education of Chinese National Practitioners (also called the \\"Beijing Chinese Medical Improvement School\\") was established on the site of the North China National Medical Academy in 1950. Shi advocated for TCM to become more rigorous and worked to standardize the names and diagnostic patterns used in TCM; he also worked to ground TCM practice and training in anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, and other basic sciences of medicine and implemented that in the curriculum of his schools. Due to the ominous political atmosphere, Shi attained his belief that \\"if one can not be a good minister, be a good doctor\\", and thus concentrated on his medical practice. He broke one character in his name, Qian (), and adopted Jinmo () as his name, incarnating the spirit of \\"shared love\\" of Mozi and the medicinal canon of Mozi. Shi was persecuted in Cultural Revolution. His health seriously deteriorated in spring 1969, and he died on August 22 in Beijing.  Family  Shi financed his niece Lu Shijia's studies at the University of G√∂ttingen in Germany under Ludwig Prandtl. Lu later became a renowned physicist who founded the aerodynamics program at Beihang University, the first in China.

The type species of the genus is Amoeba proteus, a common freshwater organism, widely studied in classrooms and laboratories. History and classification The first illustration of an amoeboid, from Roesel von Rosenhof's Insecten- Belustigung (1755). The earliest record of an organism resembling Amoeba was produced in 1755 by August Johann R√∂sel von Rosenhof, who named his discovery \\"der kleine Proteus\\" (\\"the little Proteus\\"), after Proteus, the shape-shifting sea-god of Greek Mythology.R√∂sel von Rosenhof, A.J. 1755. Der monatlich- herausgege benen Insecten-Belustigung erster [bis vierter] Theil... J.J. Fleischmann: N√ºrnberg. Vol. 3, Tab. 101, , p. 621, p. 622, . While R√∂sel's illustrations show a creature similar in appearance to the one now known as Amoeba proteus, his \\"little Proteus cannot be identified confidently with any modern species. The term \\"Proteus animalcule\\" remained in use throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, as an informal name for any large, free-living amoeboid. In 1758, apparently without seeing R√∂sel's \\"Proteus\\" for himself, Carl Linnaeus included the organism in his own system of classification, under the name Volvox chaos. However, because the name Volvox had already been applied to a genus of flagellate algae, he later changed the name to Chaos chaos. In 1786, the Danish Naturalist Otto M√ºller described and illustrated a species he called Proteus diffluens, which was probably the organism known today as Amoeba proteus. The genus Amiba, from the Greek amoib√® (·ºÄŒºŒøŒπŒ≤ŒÆ), meaning \\"change\\", was erected in 1822 by Bory de Saint-Vincent.Bory de Saint- Vincent, J. B. G. M. \\"Essai d'une classification des animaux microscopiques.\\" Agasse, Paris (1826).p. 28 In, 1830. the German naturalist C. G. Ehrenberg adopted this genus in his own classification of microscopic creatures, but changed the spelling to \\"Amoeba.\\"Ehrenberg, Christian Gottfried.

Druckerei der K√∂niglichen akademie der wissenschaften, 1832. p. 59 Anatomy, feeding and reproduction left Species of Amoeba move and feed by extending temporary structures called pseudopodia. These are formed by the coordinated action of microfilaments within the cellular cytoplasm pushing out the plasma membrane which surrounds the cell. In Amoeba, the pseudopodia are approximately tubular, and rounded at the ends (lobose). The cell's overall shape may change rapidly as pseudopodia are extended and retracted into the cell body. An Amoeba may produce many pseudopodia at once, especially when freely floating. When crawling rapidly along a surface, the cell may take a roughly monopodial form, with a single dominant pseudopod deployed in the direction of movement. Historically, researchers have divided the cytoplasm into two parts, consisting of a granular inner endoplasm and an outer layer of clear ectoplasm, both enclosed within a flexible plasma membrane. The cell usually has a single granular nucleus, containing most of the organism's DNA . A contractile vacuole is used to maintain osmotic equilibrium by excreting excess water from the cell (see Osmoregulation). An Amoeba obtains its food by phagocytosis, engulfing smaller organisms and particles of organic matter, or by pinocytosis, taking in dissolved nutrients through vesicles formed within the cell membrane. Food enveloped by the Amoeba is stored in digestive organelles called food vacuoles. Amoeba, like other unicellular eukaryotic organisms, reproduces asexually by mitosis and cytokinesis. Sexual phenomena have not been directly observed in Amoeba, although sexual exchange of genetic material is known to occur in other Amoebozoan groups. Most amoebozoans appear capable of performing syngamy, recombination and ploidy reduction through a standard meiotic process. The ‚Äúasexual‚Äù model organism Amoeba proteus has most of the proteins associated with sexual processes. In cases where organisms are forcibly divided, the portion that retains the nucleus will often survive and form a new cell and cytoplasm, while the other portion dies. Osmoregulation Like many other protists, species of Amoeba control osmotic pressures with the help of a membrane-bound organelle called the contractile vacuole. Amoeba proteus has one contractile vacuole which slowly fills with water from the cytoplasm (diastole), then, while fusing with the cell membrane, quickly contracts (systole), releasing water to the outside by exocytosis. This process regulates the amount of water present in the cytoplasm of the amoeba. Immediately after the contractile vacuole (CV) expels water, its membrane crumples. Soon afterwards, many small vacuoles or vesicles appear surrounding the membrane of the CV. It is suggested that these vesicles split from the CV membrane itself. The small vesicles gradually increase in size as they take in water and then they fuse with the CV, which grows in size as it fills with water. Therefore, the function of these numerous small vesicles is to collect excess cytoplasmic water and channel it to the central CV. The CV swells for a number of minutes and then contracts to expel the water outside. The cycle is then repeated again. The membranes of the small vesicles as well as the membrane of the CV have aquaporin proteins embedded in them. These transmembrane proteins facilitate water passage through the membranes. The presence of aquaporin proteins in both CV and the small vesicles suggests that water collection occurs both through the CV membrane itself as well as through the function of the vesicles. However, the vesicles, being more numerous and smaller, would allow a faster water uptake due to the larger total surface area provided by the vesicles. The small vesicles also have another protein embedded in their membrane: vacuolar-type H+-ATPase or V-ATPase. This ATPase pumps H+ ions into the vesicle lumen, lowering its pH with respect to the cytosol. However, the pH of the CV in some amoebas is only mildly acidic, suggesting that the H+ ions are being removed from the CV or from the vesicles. It is thought that the electrochemical gradient generated by V-ATPase might be used for the transport of ions (it is presumed K+ and Cl‚àí) into the vesicles. This builds an osmotic gradient across the vesicle membrane, leading to influx of water from the cytosol into the vesicles by osmosis, which is facilitated by aquaporins. Since these vesicles fuse with the central contractile vacuole, which expels the water, ions end up being removed from the cell, which is not beneficial for a freshwater organism. The removal of ions with the water has to be compensated by some yet-unidentified mechanism. Like other eukaryotes, Amoeba species are adversely affected by excessive osmotic pressure caused by extremely saline or dilute water. In saline water, an Amoeba will prevent the influx of salt, resulting in a net loss of water as the cell becomes isotonic with the environment, causing the cell to shrink. Placed into fresh water, Amoeba will match the concentration of the surrounding water, causing the cell to swell. If the surrounding water is too dilute, the cell may burst. Amoeba cysts In environments that are potentially lethal to the cell, an Amoeba may become dormant by forming itself into a ball and secreting a protective membrane to become a microbial cyst. The cell remains in this state until it encounters more favourable conditions. While in cyst form the amoeba will not replicate and may die if unable to emerge for a lengthy period of time.

Early life Greensill is of Tainui, Ngati Porou, and Ngati Paniora descent, born in the late 1940s in Hamilton and raised at Raglan, on the turangawaewae of Tainui o Tainui ki Whaingaroa. She was educated at Raglan Primary, Raglan District High School, Hamilton Technical College, Hamilton Teachers College and at Waikato University. She holds a Trained Teachers Certificate, LLB (Bachelor of Laws), Bachelor of Social Sciences with 1st class Honours and is currently completing a Masters of Social Science. Greensill's first job was as a primary school teacher both in New Zealand and in Brisbane. Between 1984-1996 while raising her young family, she worked for her hapu as co-ordinator of employment and skills training and conservation programmes for youth in the Raglan Catchment area. After completing a law degree she was employed by University of Waikato in 1999 to teach in the Department of Geography, Tourism and Environmental Planning specialising in treaties, MƒÅori Geography and Resource Management. The environment As an advocate for the protection of the environment and for Maori land rights of West Coast whanau and hapu in the Whaingaroa area since the mid-70s, Greensill's legal efforts have been crucial in helping to block human-cow transgenic field trials being conducted by AgResearch Ltd, and helped to educate MƒÅori communities on the implications of Genetic Engineering. Due to her expertise in this field she was interviewed in the documentary film The Leech and the Earthworm by Max Pugh and Marc Silver. Land rights Greensill assisted in organising the land occupation at the Raglan Golf Course (see MƒÅori protest movement), which played a prominent role in helping recognise issues around MƒÅori land rights in New Zealand. Greensill was with her mother, Eva Rickard, when she was arrested on charges of trespassing. Due to prolonged legal efforts the land was later returned to the local tribe. Greensill was also involved in land occupations at Bastion Point, Awhitu, and others elsewhere. Political background Ranked third, she stood in the in the electorate for the Mana MƒÅori Movement but was unsuccessful. Greensill was one of the final co-leaders of the Mana MƒÅori Movement, which she called into recess in 2005 so that the combined efforts of that party could be utilised in the founding and promoting of the MƒÅori Party. In the past Greensill supported MƒÅori political party Mana Motuhake. One policy Greensill has advocated for is the recognition in law of the 1835 Declaration of Independence. Greensill unsuccessfully stood for the MƒÅori Party in the Maori electorates of and Hauraki-Waikato in the New Zealand general elections of and respectively. In 2011, however, she joined the breakaway Mana Party, saying that the MƒÅori Party was no longer listening to the people. She contested the Hauraki-Waikato electorate again for her new party in the and elections.

Worms vary in size from microscopic to over in length for marine polychaete worms (bristle worms), for the African giant earthworm, Microchaetus rappi,Keely Parrack (21 June 2005) \\"The Mighty Worm\\". Worm Digest. and for the marine nemertean worm (bootlace worm), Lineus longissimus.Mark Carwardine (1995) The Guinness Book of Animal Records. Guinness Publishing. p. 232. Various types of worm occupy a small variety of parasitic niches, living inside the bodies of other animals. Free-living worm species do not live on land, but instead, live in marine or freshwater environments, or underground by burrowing. In biology, \\"worm\\" refers to an obsolete taxon, vermes, used by Carolus Linnaeus and Jean- Baptiste Lamarck for all non-arthropod invertebrate animals, now seen to be paraphyletic. The name stems from the Old English word wyrm. Most animals called \\"worms\\" are invertebrates, but the term is also used for the amphibian caecilians and the slowworm Anguis, a legless burrowing lizard. Invertebrate animals commonly called \\"worms\\" include annelids (earthworms and marine polychaete or bristle worms), nematodes (roundworms), platyhelminthes (flatworms), marine nemertean worms (\\"bootlace worms\\"), marine Chaetognatha (arrow worms), priapulid worms, and insect larvae such as grubs and maggots. Worms may also be called helminths, particularly in medical terminology when referring to parasitic worms, especially the Nematoda (roundworms) and Cestoda (tapeworms) which reside in the intestines of their host. When an animal or human is said to \\"have worms\\", it means that it is infested with parasitic worms, typically roundworms or tapeworms. Lungworm is also a common parasitic worm found in various animal species such as fish and cats.  History  Paragordius tricuspidatus, a nematomorphan Pseudoceros dimidiatus, a flatworm In taxonomy, \\"worm\\" refers to an obsolete grouping, Vermes, used by Carl Linnaeus and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck for all non-arthropod invertebrate animals, now seen to be polyphyletic. In 1758, Linnaeus created the first hierarchical classification in his Systema Naturae. In his original scheme, the animals were one of three kingdoms, divided into the classes of Vermes, Insecta, Pisces, Amphibia, Aves, and Mammalia. Since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum, the Chordata, while his Insecta (which included the crustaceans and arachnids) and Vermes have been renamed or broken up. The process was begun in 1793 by Lamarck, who called the Vermes une esp√®ce de chaos (a sort of chaos) and split the group into three new phyla, worms, echinoderms, and polyps (which contained corals and jellyfish). By 1809, in his Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck had created 9 phyla apart from vertebrates (where he still had 4 phyla: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish) and molluscs, namely cirripedes, annelids, crustaceans, arachnids, insects, worms, radiates, polyps, and infusorians. Chordates are remarkably wormlike by ancestry.  Informal grouping  In the 13th century, worms were recognized in Europe as part of the category of reptiles that consisted of a miscellany of egg-laying creatures, including \\"snakes, various fantastic monsters, lizards, assorted amphibians,\\" as recorded by Vincent of Beauvais in his Mirror of Nature. In everyday language, the term worm is also applied to various other living forms such as larvae, insects, millipedes, centipedes, shipworms (teredo worms), or even some vertebrates (creatures with a backbone) such as blindworms and caecilians. Worms can be divided into several groups, but are still technically decomposers. * The first of these, Platyhelminthes, includes the flatworms, tapeworms, and flukes. They have a flat, ribbon- or leaf-shaped body with a pair of eyes at the front. Some are parasites. * The second group contains the threadworms, roundworms, and hookworms. This phylum is called Nematoda. Threadworms may be microscopic, such as the vinegar eelworm, or more than 1 metre (3 feet) long. They are found in damp earth, moss, decaying substances, fresh water, or salt water. Some roundworms are also parasites. The Guinea worm, for example, gets under the skin of the feet and legs of people living in tropical countries. * The third group consists of the segmented worms, with bodies divided into segments, or rings. This phylum is called Annelida. Among these are the earthworms and the bristle worms of the sea. Familiar worms include the earthworms, members of phylum Annelida. Other invertebrate groups may be called worms, especially colloquially. In particular, many unrelated insect larvae are called \\"worms\\", such as the railroad worm, woodworm, glowworm, bloodworm, inchworm, mealworm, silkworm, and woolly bear worm. Worms may also be called helminths, particularly in medical terminology when referring to parasitic worms, especially the Nematoda (roundworms) and Cestoda (tapeworms). Hence \\"helminthology\\" is the study of parasitic worms. When a human or an animal, such as a dog or horse, is said to \\"have worms\\", it means that it is infested with parasitic worms, typically roundworms or tapeworms. Deworming is a method to kill off the worms that have infected a human or animal by giving anthelmintic drugs. \\"Ringworm\\" is not a worm at all, but a skin fungus.  Society and culture  Worm Hotel Wurm, or wyrm was the Old English term for carnivorous reptiles (\\"serpents\\"), and mythical dragons. Worm has been used as a pejorative epithet to describe a cowardly, weak or pitiable person. Worms can also be farmed for the production of nutrient-rich vermicompost.

It was her first novel after the widely successful Bel Canto (2001). Plot summary This novel tells the story of Bernard Doyle, an Irish Catholic Boston politician. He and wife Bernadette have one biological son and later adopt African-American brothers Tip and Teddy. (The adoptees' names were given to them by the Doyles as a tribute to the Massachusetts politicians Thomas \\"Tip\\" O'Neill and Edward \\"Teddy\\" Kennedy.) Four years later, Doyle loses Bernadette to cancer. Sixteen years after his wife's death, Tip and Teddy are university students. Bernard, the former mayor of Boston, has invited them to a Jesse Jackson lecture and a reception afterward. Tip is pushed out of the path of an oncoming vehicle by a woman the family believes is a stranger. The novel's plot centers around that woman's identity and that of her 11-year-old daughter Kenya, who comes to stay with the Doyles. Interracial adoption, family allegiances and rivalries, and Boston‚Äôs notoriously complex political and racial history come into play, as does the role of religious faith in each family member's life. Reception Run received mixed reviews but was a New York Times bestseller.https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/books/bestseller/bestpapertradefiction.html Leah Hager Cohen of The New York Times said in her review: > \\"If Patchett had exhumed her characters‚Äô motivations more thoroughly, she > might have persuaded readers of the circumstances that led to such a choice. > And in so doing she might have elicited deeper sympathy and interest. The > Jesse Jackson lecture turns out to be little more than a set piece, and the > characters‚Äô racial identities are either ignored or too broadly indicated. > (Kenya and her mother live in a housing project; Kenya, Tip and Teddy are > all endowed with a stereotypical black athletic gift, a talent for running.) > It‚Äôs difficult to understand why an author would seed her story with > potentially rich material only to refrain from exploring it. But this might > explain why Patchett‚Äôs characters ultimately feel less real than symbolic, > as wooden as the Virgin‚Äôs > statue.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/books/review/Cohen-t.html Nora Seton of the Houston Chronicle said: \\"This is a novel staffed exclusively by protagonists, and Patchett's often dazzling insights cannot lift it into second gear. Run would have profited from a brutish and anguished soul.\\"https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/books/reviews/5189344.html Writing for The New Yorker, John Updike said: \\"As realism, her novel is pale; but as a metaphoric representation of growth it transcends its sentimentality.\\"https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/10/01/071001crbo_books_updike?currentPage=2 Andrew O'Hagan said in Publishers Weekly: \\" ... the book is lovely to read and is satisfyingly bold in its attempt to say something patient and true about family.\\"http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6459864.html?q=run+ann+patchett References External links *http://www.post- gazette.com/pg/07294/826610-148.stm/ *Guardian Review *The Independent Review *http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/fiction/article2436947.ece/ 2007 American novels HarperCollins books Novels set in Boston Novels by Ann Patchett ","title":"Run (novel)"},{"id":"19180232","text":"Restoration Sclerosaurus is an extinct genus of procolophonid parareptile known from the Early to Middle Triassic of Germany and Switzerland. It contains a single species, Sclerosaurus armatus. It was a fairly small about 30 cm long, distinguished from other known parareptiles by the possession of long, backwardly projecting spikes, rear lower jaw teeth with slightly imbricating crowns, and a narrow band of back armor comprising two or three rows of sculptured osteoderms on either side of the midline. Traditional classifications, e.g. Carroll (1988) placed Sclerosaurus with the procolophonids, however some phylogenetic studies have found it to be a close relative of the pareiasaurs, and together with that group it forms the clade Pareiasauroidea.Jalil, N.

More recent phylogenetic analyses place Sclerosaurus within Procolophonidae as originally suggested, and support its referral to the Leptopleuroninae. Sclerosaurus is most closely related to Scoloparia glyphanodon from Nova Scotia, Canada, and together they form the Sclerosaurini tribe within Leptopleuroninae.

It was first published in the Civil and Military Gazette on March 25, 1887; in book form, first in the first Indian edition of Plain Tales from the Hills in 1888; and in the many subsequent editions of that collection. It is one of the \\"Tales\\" which deals with the tense, enclosed society of the British in India, and the levels of gossip and malice that could be engendered therein. \\"Watches of the Night,\\" like many of Kipling's works, has a punning, allusive title. The phrase 'watches of the night' has been used since at least the Book of Common Prayer (1662), and dates back further: \\"the watches of the night: the night- time; watch originally each of the three or four periods of time, during which a watch or guard was kept, into which the night was divided by the Jews and Romans\\".http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry;=t214.e7611 The phrase occurs in the King James Bible (Psalms), and has also been used in several works of literature as a clich√© for what is also called 'the wee small hours', or 'the early morning', often with connotations of blackness (both of night and of the spirits) and depression (e. g. Longfellow wrote in The Cross of Snow (1879) \\"In the long, sleepless watches of the night\\"). Kipling uses this, along with a pun on the word 'watches': the story turns on two identical timepieces. Both the Colonel, commanding the regiment, and a Subaltern in the Regiment, Platte, a poor man, own Waterbury watches. (These are fob or Pocket watches, not wrist watches: Each usually hangs from a chain.) The Waterbury (from the town of Waterbury, Connecticut is a mass-produced and not especially prestigious make. The Colonel, who affects to be \\"a horsey man\\" (but is not) wears his watch, not on a chain, but on a leather strap made from the lip- strap of a horse's harness; Platte wears his from a leather guard, presumably because he can afford no better. One night the two men change - in a hurry - at the Club, and, not unnaturally, take each other's watch. They go on their separate ways. Later that night, as Platte returns home, his horse rears and upsets his cart, throwing him to the ground outside Mrs Larkyn's house, where his watch falls loose. The Colonel loses his watch, which slips on to the floor - where a native bearer finds it (and keeps it). Going home in a hired carriage, the Colonel finds the driver drunk, and returns late. His wife, who is religious (and, we have been told \\"manufactured the Station scandal\\"), is disinclined to believe him. In the morning, Mrs Larkyn, who has been a victim of the Colonel's wife scandal-mongering, finds the watch that Platte has dropped, and shows it to him. He affects to believe it is \\"...disgusting! Shocking old man!\\". They send the Colonel's watch (which is the one Platte had been wearing) to the Colonel's wife. She attacks the Colonel, being wholly convinced of Original Sin - and begins to realise the harm and pain that unfounded suspicion can cause - and has caused her victims. That is really the moral of the story. \\"The mistrust and the tragedy of it,\\" says Kipling, \\"are killing the Colonel's Wife, and are making the Colonel wretched. :All quotations in this article have been taken from the Uniform Edition of Plain Tales from the Hills published by Macmillan & Co., Limited in London in 1899.

First found in Northern Italy in 1975, it is one of the most primitive drepanosaurs. V. cenenis is the type species, which was first mentioned in 1991 but only formally described in 2006. A second species, V. zorzinensis, was named in 2010. Discovery The first specimen of Vallesaurus cenensis, MCSNB 4751, was found in 1975 by the staff of the Museo Civico di Scienze Naturali of Bergamo, Italy. The genus was named in respect of professor Valle, the former director of the museum. The species, on the other hand, was named after a local municipality called Cene, which was neighboring the site where the fossil was excavated. The specimen was given to palaeontologist Rupert Wild to study at the Staatliches Museum of Stuttgart, Germany. Wild briefly mentioned \\"Vallesaurus cenensis\\" in 1991, but without describing it formally or identifying the holotype specimen. Pinna (1993) listed the name when surveying Triassic reptiles in Italy, and identified MCSNB 4751 as its holotype. Renesto and Binelli formally described Vallesaurus cenensis in 2006, and attributed the name to Wild. However, Renesto et al. (2010) later attributed the name to Renesto & Binelli (2006), arguing that Vallesaurus cenensis was a nomen nudum prior to that study. A second species, V. zorzinensis, was found in the same location and identified from the specimen MCSNB 4783. Its specific name referred to the Zorzino Limestone Formation, where the holotype was found. Description Vallesaurus is a small drepanosaurid about long. The manus (hand) is pentadactyl, with the 4th digit being the longest and equal in length to the humerus. The tarsus (ankle) has a centrale which articulates with the tibia. In addition, the foot of Vallesaurus also has modified distal tarsals and metatarsals, and a clawless hallux. Vallesaurus differs in some characteristics from another drepanosaur, Megalancosaurus. Vallesaurus has a proportionally shorter and higher snout, a thicker and larger maxilla and set of maxillary teeth, and a shorter cervical vertebra. It also lacks the fusion between the neural spines of the second and third dorsal vertebrae. Vallesaurus differs from Drepanosaurus, another drepanosaur, in that it lacks the enormous claw found on the second digit of the manus. It can be distinguished from Drepanosaurus, Megalancosaurus and possibly Dolabrosaurus in the lack of a terminal spine at the end of the tail. In addition, Vallesaurus also differs from Hypuronector, a related drepanosaur, in having anteroposteriorly extended neural spines of the anterior dorsal vertebrae and forelimbs much shorter than the hindlimbs.

It is also called (Ï°±Ïùò, ), jokgeon (Ï°±Í±¥, ) or mal (Îßê, ) in hanja. According to a book titled (ÌõàÎ™ΩÏûêÌöå,Ë®ìËíôÂ≠óÊúÉ) written by Choe Sejin (ÏµúÏÑ∏ÏßÑ,Â¥î‰∏ñÁèç) in 1527 during the reign of King Jungjong of the Joseon Dynasty (1392 - 1910), was called (Î≥¥ÏÖòÎßê), so it may be called by the name before the time. It is not clear when first began to be worn, but ancient is assumed to be a form extended from a trouser or bojagi (wrapping clothes) for protecting the foot. During the period of the Three Kingdoms of Korea (57 BC ‚Äì 668 AD), made of silk was worn but it was limited by social class. In the Joseon period, beoseon made of a white fabric was usually worn regardless of class except special occasions. Types Tarae- beoseon, a variety of beoseon for children The types of beoseon can be varied by purpose, shape, and sewing technique. Goteun beoseon (Í≥ßÏùÄÎ≤ÑÏÑ†) or also called godeulmok beoseon (Í≥†Îì§Î™©Î≤ÑÏÑ†) and nuin beoseon (ÎàÑÏù∏Î≤ÑÏÑ†) are defined by shape. According to sewing technique, beoseon is divided into som beoseon, gyeop beoseon, hot beoseon, nubi beoseon, and tarae beoseon. Som beoseon (ÏÜúÎ≤ÑÏÑ†) is composed of the outer fabric and cotton (som in Korean) as a batting to give foot warmth and style. Gyeop beoseon (Í≤πÎ≤ÑÏÑ†) is made with two layers (gyeop) of a fabric without stuffing the inside. Hot beoseon (ÌôëÎ≤ÑÏÑ†) is made with one layer (hot) and worn as an inner sock to prevent the outer beoseon from getting dirty. Nubi beoseon (ÎàÑÎπÑÎ≤ÑÏÑ†) is made by quilting (nubi) and usually worn for protection against the cold during winter. The beoseon is considered practical because of the easiness to handle after cleaning although the running stitches can be broken or it is stiff than other beoseon. Tarae beoseon (ÌÉÄÎûòÎ≤ÑÏÑ†) is decorative socks for children. After quilted, tarae beosoen is embroidered with strings in various colors, and a string is attached to each portion of ankle to bind them at the front. Although the shape of beoseon does not reflect gender, beoseon for men have a straighter seam than that of women.

The stores allowed consumers to return goods for cash. History The company was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1893, by Louis, Solomon, and Sigmund Kann. The Baltimore family originally came to Washington in 1890, to liquidate Abe Kaufman's store at 909 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, and returned to establish a permanent business.

It was conquered and subjugated by the empire of the Medes during the 7th century BC, was incorporated into the subsequent Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great in the 6th century BC, and formed part of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire following the 4th-century-BC conquests of Alexander the Great. The region later served as the political and cultural base of the Eastern-Iranian Parni people and Arsacid dynasty, rulers of the Parthian Empire (247 BC ‚Äì 224 AD). The Sasanian Empire, the last state of pre- Islamic Iran, also held the region and maintained the Seven Parthian clans as part of their feudal aristocracy. Name Xerxes I tomb, Parthian soldier circa 470 BCE The name \\"Parthia\\" is a continuation from Latin ', from Old Persian ', which was the Parthian language self-designator signifying \\"of the Parthians\\" who were an Iranian people. In context to its Hellenistic period, Parthia also appears as Parthyaea. Geography Parthia roughly corresponds to a region in northeastern Iran, though part is in Turkmenistan. It was bordered by the Karakum desert in the north, included Kopet Dag mountain range and the Dasht-e-Kavir desert in the south. It bordered Media on the west, Hyrcania on the north west, Margiana on the north east, and Aria on the south east. During Arsacid times, Parthia was united with Hyrcania as one administrative unit, and that region is therefore often (subject to context) considered a part of Parthia proper. History Under the Achaemenids Parthia ( **ìä™ìÉ≠ìçòìáãìçØìàâ** , P-rw-t-i-wÍú£), as one of the 24 subjects of the Achaemenid Empire, in the Egyptian Statue of Darius I. As the region inhabited by Parthians, Parthia first appears as a political entity in Achaemenid lists of governorates (\\"satrapies\\") under their dominion. Prior to this, the people of the region seem to have been subjects of the Medes,. and 7th century BC Assyrian texts mention a country named Partakka or Partukka (though this \\"need not have coincided topographically with the later Parthia\\").. A year after Cyrus the Great's defeat of the Median Astyages, Parthia became one of the first provinces to acknowledge Cyrus as their ruler, \\"and this allegiance secured Cyrus' eastern flanks and enabled him to conduct the first of his imperial campaigns ‚Äì against Sardis.\\". According to Greek sources, following the seizure of the Achaemenid throne by Darius I, the Parthians united with the Median king Phraortes to revolt against him. Hystaspes, the Achaemenid governor of the province (said to be father of Darius I), managed to suppress the revolt, which seems to have occurred around 522‚Äì521 BC. The first indigenous Iranian mention of Parthia is in the Behistun inscription of Darius I, where Parthia is listed (in the typical Iranian clockwise order) among the governorates in the vicinity of Drangiana. The inscription dates to c. 520 BC. The center of the administration \\"may have been at [what would later be known as] Hecatompylus\\".. The Parthians also appear in Herodotus' list of peoples subject to the Achaemenids; the historiographer treats the Parthians, Chorasmians, Sogdians and Areioi as peoples of a single satrapy (the 16th), whose annual tribute to the king he states to be only 300 talents of silver. This \\"has rightly caused disquiet to modern scholars.\\". At the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC between the forces of Darius III and those of Alexander the Great, one such Parthian unit was commanded by Phrataphernes, who was at the time Achaemenid governor of Parthia. Following the defeat of Darius III, Phrataphernes surrendered his governorate to Alexander when the Macedonian arrived there in the summer of 330 BC. Phrataphernes was reappointed governor by Alexander. Under the Seleucids Following the death of Alexander, in the Partition of Babylon in 323 BC, Parthia became a Seleucid governorate under Nicanor. Phrataphernes, the former governor, became governor of Hyrcania. In 320 BC, at the Partition of Triparadisus, Parthia was reassigned to Philip, former governor of Sogdiana. A few years later, the province was invaded by Peithon, governor of Media Magna, who then attempted to make his brother Eudamus governor. Peithon and Eudamus were driven back, and Parthia remained a governorate in its own right. In 316 BC, Stasander, a vassal of Seleucus I Nicator and governor of Bactria (and, it seems, also of Aria and Margiana) was appointed governor of Parthia. For the next 60 years, various Seleucids would be appointed governors of the province. Andragoras, the last Seleucid satrap of Parthia. He proclaimed independence around 250 BC. In 247 BC, following the death of Antiochus II, Ptolemy III seized control of the Seleucid capital at Antioch, and \\"so left the future of the Seleucid dynasty for a moment in question.\\". Taking advantage of the uncertain political situation, Andragoras, the Seleucid governor of Parthia, proclaimed his independence and began minting his own coins. Meanwhile, \\"a man called Arsaces, of Scythian or Bactrian origin, [was] elected leader of the Parni\\",. an eastern-Iranian peoples from the Tajen/Tajend River valley, south-east of the Caspian Sea.. Following the secession of Parthia from the Seleucid Empire and the resultant loss of Seleucid military support, Andragoras had difficulty in maintaining his borders, and about 238 BC ‚Äì under the command of \\"Arsaces and his brother Tiridates\\". ‚Äì the Parni invaded. Parthia and seized control of Astabene (Astawa), the northern region of that territory, the administrative capital of which was Kabuchan (Kuchan in the vulgate). A short while later the Parni seized the rest of Parthia from Andragoras, killing him in the process. Although an initial punitive expedition by the Seleucids under Seleucus II was not successful, the Seleucids under Antiochus III recaptured Arsacid controlled territory in 209 BC from Arsaces' (or Tiridates') successor, Arsaces II. Arsaces II sued for peace and accepted vassal status, and it was not until Arsaces II's grandson (or grand-nephew) Phraates I, that the Arsacids/Parni would again begin to assert their independence..

Reproduction of a Parthian archer as depicted on Trajan's Column. Hellenistic- style helmet, from the Parthian royal residence and necropolis of Nisa, 2nd century BC From their base in Parthia, the Arsacid dynasts eventually extended their dominion to include most of Greater Iran. They also quickly established several eponymous branches on the thrones of Armenia, Iberia, and Caucasian Albania. Even though the Arsacids only sporadically had their capital in Parthia, their power base was there, among the Parthian feudal families, upon whose military and financial support the Arsacids depended. In exchange for this support, these families received large tracts of land among the earliest conquered territories adjacent to Parthia, which the Parthian nobility then ruled as provincial rulers. The largest of these city-states were Kuchan, Semnan, Gorgan, Merv, Zabol and Yazd. From about 105 BC onwards, the power and influence of this handful of Parthian noble families was such that they frequently opposed the monarch, and would eventually be a \\"contributory factor in the downfall\\" of the dynasty.. From about 130 BC onwards, Parthia suffered numerous incursions by various nomadic tribes, including the Sakas, the Yuezhi, and the Massagetae. Each time, the Arsacid dynasts responded personally, doing so even when there were more severe threats from Seleucids or Romans looming on the western borders of their empire (as was the case for Mithridates I). Defending the empire against the nomads cost Phraates II and Artabanus I their lives. The Roman Crassus attempted to conquer Parthia in 52 BC but was decisively defeated at the Battle of Carrhae. Caesar was planning another invasion when he was assassinated in 44 BC. A long series of Roman-Parthian wars followed. Around 32 BC, civil war broke out when a certain Tiridates rebelled against Phraates IV, probably with the support of the nobility that Phraates had previously persecuted. The revolt was initially successful, but failed by 25 BC.. In 9/8, the Parthian nobility succeeded in putting their preferred king on the throne, but Vonones proved to have too tight a budgetary control, so he was usurped in favor of Artabanus II, who seems to have been a non-Arsacid Parthian nobleman. But when Artabanus attempted to consolidate his position (at which he was successful in most instances), he failed to do so in the regions where the Parthian provincial rulers held sway.. By the 2nd century AD, the frequent wars with neighboring Rome and with the nomads, and the infighting among the Parthian nobility had weakened the Arsacids to a point where they could no longer defend their subjugated territories. The empire fractured as vassalaries increasingly claimed independence or were subjugated by others, and the Arsacids were themselves finally vanquished by the Persian Sassanids, a formerly minor vassal from southwestern Iran, in April 224. Under the Sasanians Under Sasanian (Sassanid) rule, Parthia was folded into a newly formed province, Khorasan, and henceforth ceased to exist as a political entity. Some of the Parthian nobility continued to resist Sasanian dominion for some time, but most switched their allegiance to the Sasanians very early. Several families that claimed descent from the Parthian noble families became a Sasanian institution known as the \\"Seven houses\\", five of which are \\"in all probability\\" not Parthian, but contrived genealogies \\"in order to emphasize the antiquity of their families.\\". Language and literature Hercules, Hatra, Iraq, Parthian period, 1st‚Äì2nd century AD. The Parthians spoke Parthian, a north-western Iranian language. No Parthian literature survives from before the Sassanid period in its original form,. and they seem to have written down only very little. The Parthians did, however, have a thriving oral minstrel-poet culture, to the extent that their word for minstrel ‚Äì gosan ‚Äì survives to this day in many Iranian languages as well as especially in Armenian (\\"gusan\\"), on which it practised heavy (especially lexical and vocabulary) influence,. These professionals were evident in every facet of Parthian daily life, from cradle to grave, and they were entertainers of kings and commoners alike, proclaiming the worthiness of their patrons through association with mythical heroes and rulers.. These Parthian heroic poems, \\"mainly known through Persian of the lost Middle Persian Xwaday-namag, and notably through Firdausi's Shahnameh, [were] doubtless not yet wholly lost in the Khurasan of [Firdausi's] day.\\". In Parthia itself, attested use of written Parthian is limited to the nearly 3,000 ostraca found (in what seems to have been a wine storage) at Nisa, in present-day Turkmenistan. A handful of other evidence of written Parthian has also been found outside Parthia; the most important of these being the part of a land-sale document found at Avroman (in the Kermanshah province of Iran), and more ostraca, graffiti and the fragment of a business letter found at Dura-Europos in present-day Syria. The Parthian Arsacids do not seem to have used Parthian until relatively late, and the language first appears on Arsacid coinage during the reign of Vologases I (51‚Äì58 AD).. Evidence that use of Parthian was nonetheless widespread comes from early Sassanid times; the declarations of the early Persian kings were ‚Äì in addition to their native Middle Persian ‚Äì also inscribed in Parthian. Society Parthian waterspout, 1st‚Äì2nd century AD. City-states of \\"some considerable size\\" existed in Parthia as early as the 1st millennium BC, \\"and not just from the time of the Achaemenids or Seleucids.\\". However, for the most part, society was rural, and dominated by large landholders with large numbers of serfs, slaves, and other indentured labor at their disposal. Communities with free peasants also existed. By Arsacid times, Parthian society was divided into the four classes (limited to freemen). At the top were the kings and near family members of the king. These were followed by the lesser nobility and the general priesthood, followed by the mercantile class and lower-ranking civil servants, and with farmers and herdsmen at the bottom. Little is known of the Parthian economy, but agriculture must have played the most important role in it. Significant trade first occurs with the establishment of the Silk road in 114 BC, when Hecatompylos became an important junction. Parthian cities Nisa (Nissa, Nusay) or Mithridatkirt, located on a main trade route, was one of the earliest capitals of the Parthian Empire (c. 250 BC). The city is located in the northern foothills of the Kopetdag mountains, 11 miles west of present-day city of Ashgabat (the capital of Turkmenistan). Nisa had a \\"soaring two-story hall in the Hellenistic Greek style\\" and temple complexes used by early Arsaces dynasty. During the reign of Mithridates I of Parthia (c. 171 BC‚Äì138 BC) it was renamed Mithradatkirt (\\"fortress of Mithradates\\"). Merv (modern-day Mary) was another Parthian city. *Asaak *Hecatompylos *Gurgan See also * List of Parthian kings * Khwarasan * Greater Khorasan * Adur Burzen-Mihr * Parthian shot References Bibliography * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * Olbrycht, Marek Jan (1998), Parthia et ulteriores gentes.

The motif consists of a stem-loop whose stem is interrupted by many internal loops and bulges. Nucleotide identities in many places are conserved, and one internal loop in particular is highly conserved. As lacto-2 RNAs are not consistently located in 5‚Ä≤ UTRs, they are presumed to correspond to non-coding RNAs.

Not much is known of his life. He was born in Calzada de Calatrava and was a Dominican friar in the convent of Santa Cruz de Segovia, one of the oldest Dominican foundations. His surname Cerratense may derive from the fact that he wrote his works in the monastery of San Pelayo de Cerrato. He lived during the reign of Alfonso X and wrote around 1276 several Vitas sanctorum, an important hagiography that concerns various Spanish saints, including the Seven Apostolic Men.

Life   Personal life  Rossello di Jacopo Franchi was born in the year 1376 or 1377.Peters, C.T. (1981). Rossello di Jacopo Franchi: Portrait of a Florentine Painter, CA. 1376-1456. Retrieved from ProQuest. He was most likely the son of Jacopo del Rosso and Catherine. His father and older brother, Nanni, both worked in the textile industry, as a wool-carder and a cloth cutter, respectively. Therefore, his entry into the arts was unexpected. The same can be said for Rossello's younger brother, Giunta, who was a painter as well. There is some speculation that there may have been ties to the Arte de Medici e Speziali through a relative. From what scholars have discerned, Rossello's life was that of a hardworking craftsman, with some assets and land, who was dealt his fair share of family troubles and frustrations with his children. Based on documents, it is presumed that Rossello's father died sometime between 1409 and 1416. However, Rossello himself was married by 1408 and had seven children, four of whom died in 1424 due to a stomach disorder. Two years later, in 1426, his first wife also died and was buried with her children at the family's parish church, S. Romolo. One year later he remarried to Mona Margherita, the sister of printmaker Giovanni di Piero di Bartolo Landi. Mona Margherita was married off with a dowry of 145 fiorini. Although the two did not have any children, three children from Rossello's previous marriage lived with them: Scolaio, Gismirante, and Palia. Rossello died on August 10, 1456, and was buried in the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence. His testament, from 1450, declares that his estate was to be divided equally among his grandsons, Giovanni and Giunta, and any other legitimate children of Gismirante. In the event that any of his heirs had an untimely death, half of the estate was to be given to the S. Maria Nuovo and the other half to the Compagnia del Bigallo. Three gold fiorinis were also to be given to these institutions. Rossello's codicil was added six years later and was finished only four days before his death. The codicil served to elaborate on restrictions for his heirs. These restrictions came from Rossello's irritation towards his son regarding poor business dealings. Rossello died just four days after the codicil was finished, and his second wife, Mona, died fifteen months after him.  Professional life  Rossello di Jacopo Franchi, whose life spanned 80 years, was actively working in the arts from at least 1404 to 1451. He was trained at the Bigallo, a major institution in Florence, Italy. He mainly painted panels and frescoes, which comprise 27 of his 29 known works. He is also documented twice as an illuminator of manuscripts, although he is never referred to as a miniaturist. The first payment made to him by the Bigallo was in 1426 for minor work, which may have included minor repairs of the decorative theme in the oratory. The first record of Rossello doing an illumination was when he painted figures in a miniature of the Company's antiphonary. The only other documented time Rossello did an illumination is from 1429 at S. Stefano on a Prato gradual, which he was paid for. From this one miniature, eleven more have been attributed to him. However, the miniatures are often seen as supplementary works because his true focus was on panels and frescoes. The third documented commission from the Bigallo was for frescoes of the Company's patron and founder, Peter Martyr. This commission was undertaken with Ventura di Moro. The painting was done in the two western mezzanine bays of the north facade of the building's oratory and has remained there since. Throughout his time at the Compagnia del Bigallo, Rossello's relationship with the Bigallo took several forms: that of a renter, of a guarantor, of a debtor and of a commissioned artist. The Bigallo frescoes and the miniatures in the Prato gradual are the basis for the rest of Rossello's works because they are the only two that are signed by Rossello and have complete documentation that include Rossello's name. The rest of his 28 works have been attributed to him based on stylistic features and documentation which lack his name but where the timing lines up within his life. Rossello's artistic style evolved through internal development, influences of other artists, and by way of temporal fashions. Rossello is well known for his drapery aesthetic because of his attention to detail and because he includes drapery in most of his paintings. His pieces are recognizable because he was an artist concerned with the minute details of his works. When painting panels, he often used careful techniques that would visually soften the major figures in the paintings. Rossello was excellent at blending colors to the point where his paintings looked almost like relief sculptures. He also used dimensionality in his works. They were typically symmetrical and balanced in ways that defied the inherent flatness of his working surface. In addition, Rossello favored delicate colors, an attribute that distinguishes him as being influenced by Lorenzo Monaco. Rossello also embellished his works with jewels, fur-lined garments and other fashions of the time. However, his paintings were never regarded as frivolous, but had more of a richness and debonair quality to them. Stylistically, Rossello di Jacopo Franchi evolved with time but remained true to the details of his work and created a definable style for himself.  Works  The earliest work ascribed to Rossello di Jacopo Franchi was a painting of Saint Blaise commissioned in 1408Anabel Thomas. \\"Franchi, Rossello di Jacopo.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 23 Apr. 2017. <http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T029613>. by Niccolo di Francesco Falcucci, a well known physician. This composition showcased Rossello's early individual style and was constructed very rigidly and systematically. Rossello's St. Blaise painting was a traditional Florentine painting of a saint who is frontally seated. It is not an innovate painting in form or design. The Saint is enthroned on a gold-embossed pillow before a richly embroidered cloth of honor held by two angels, is a type familiar from trecento painting. Some stylistic features, such as the tiny head with a slender, elongated body indicates the influence of Lorenzo Monaco and Lorenzo Ghiberti.

He worked mostly in Milan and Lombardy, and was employed by the Visconti family, rulers of Milan. Michelino's work follows the traditions of the Lombard School, and maintains the Trecento style. Personal life Michelino was born in 1388 and died sometime after 1450. It is believed that he is referred to in some documents from the period by the name Michele da Pavia, as he lived in Pavia at the beginning of his career. Michelino lived in Milan from 1439 until his death, where he worked for the Viscontis, rulers of Milan. When his patron, first Duke of Milan Gian Galeazzo Visconti died and Giovanni Maria Visconti fell into power, Michelino moved to Venice and Vicenza to avoid Giovanni's difficult reign. In Venice, Michelino was in contact with painter Gentile da Fabriano (Gentile di Niccol√≤ di Massio). Michelino had a son, Leonardo, who was also a manuscript illuminator and worked between 1428 and 1488. Leonardo‚Äôs work includes notable frescoes that remain in the church of Saint Giovanni a Carbonara in Naples, Italy.  Career  253x253px As a fifteenth century Italian artist of the Lombard School, Michelino‚Äôs illuminations follow a linear form of the International Gothic Style, and are abstract, yet appear to be naturalistic because of the detailed nature of the artist‚Äôs work. Though few of his works have survived to the present day, Michelino was among the most famous artists of his day, and was widely acclaimed and praised. Remaining examples of Michelino‚Äôs work deny the classicizing style of the Renaissance, instead maintaining the more rigid forms of the outdated, Gothic style of the Proto-Renaissance. Michelino's career was most relevant during his time in Milan, where he worked for the Visconti family. Michelino was given major commissions in Milan, and was notably employed to design windows for the Visconti‚Äôs cathedral.  Eulogy for Giangaleazzo Visconti  In 1404, Michelino created miniature illuminations for the funeral oration of his patron, Gian Galeazzo Visconti. These miniatures are now owned by the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris. The text of this Eulogy for Giangaleazzo Visctoni was commissioned by the Visconti court and written by an Augustinian monk, Pietro da Castelletto. Michelino's illuminations of the text include delicate garlands of flowers that surround Pietro da Castelletto's text. Michelino's illuminations also feature details such a cloth of honor with both imperial and Viscoti coats of arms. The coats of arms serve as a background for a scene of Pietro's eulogy which shows Giangaleazzo's coronation, performed by the Christ Child, who is shown as larger than all other figures in the work. Other scenes include Pietro da Castelletto as he addresses Augustinians from his pulpit. The Eulogy for Giangaleazzo Visconti also includes Michelino's illuminations of a complete genealogy of the Visconti family, which Michelino defines through profile depictions that draw from Greco-Roman coins and medals. The genealogy traces the Viscontis back to the marriage of Trojan prince Anchises and the goddess Venus, which was allegedly performed by Jupiter. Michelino represents Anchises, Venus, and Jupiter as 15th century Florentine nobility. The references to antiquity in this work imply humanism at the Visconti court, even as they take on a medieval appearance through Michelino's work. This work is similar to art from the Valois court in France, and therefore appealed to the royal focus of the Visconti family, and their desire for dynastic power through marriage. The detailed and refined nature of this work and its similarity to work of the Valois court highlights why Michelino's work was so appealing to aristocracy.thumbSt. Luke Painting the Virgin, Michelino Molinari da Besozzo, Prayer Book in Latin, Milan, ca. 1420, 170 x 120 mm 255x255px  St. Luke Painting the Virgin  St. Luke Painting the Virgin is an illumination from a small Latin prayer book from 1420 which currently resides in the collection of the Morgan Library and Museum. This prayer book holds the majority of Michelino‚Äôs existing work, and its text, consisting of 47 prayers, was written in dark brown ink by a single scribe. The book, now bound with 19th century velvet with silver clasps, includes 22 full-page illuminations with floral borders; however, half of the original miniature illuminations are now missing. The illumination of St. Luke Painting the Virgin depicts St. Luke finishing painting a panel of the Virgin and Child, and is among the first Western representations of this scene. Later in the 15th century and throughout the remainder of the Italian Renaissance this subject became increasingly popular, for St. Luke was patron saint of painters and painters‚Äô guilds. Throughout the 15th, 16th, and 17 centuries, artists continued to propagate saintly artistic creation by showing St. Luke painting the Madonna and Child. Michelino's version features St. Luke standing as he works on a gable-topped panel, while in Georgio Vasari's 1565 fresco of the scene that resides in the church of Santissima Annuciata, St. Luke paints a portrait of an other-worldly sitter, who is also captured in Vasari's painting.236x236px  Maturity  Michelino's 1410 visit to Venice was incredibly significant to the overall development of Venetian painting in the following two decades. Both Venice and Vicenza appreciated and lauded Michelino's delicate style. Other notable works include Mystic Marriage of St Catherine, which is now located in the Pinacoteca in Siena. This small painting depicts the marriage between St Catherine and Christ. Mystic Marriage of St Catherine and the Marriage of the Virgin are the only two works (both panel paintings) that can definitively be attributed to Michelino. Marriage of the Virgin is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, and now has a damaged surface. This work, made from tempera on wood with raised gold ornament depicts an elderly Joseph presenting a young and timid Virgin with a ring. The humor found in the expressions of the surrounding rejected men highlight Michelino's skill through his ability to inject movement into the scene with expression. Marriage of the Virgin mirrors the crowded composition of Michelino's work with illuminated manuscripts; furthermore, the curvilinear forms in the work are emblematic of the International Gothic Style.  Legacy and significance  Michelino was given great recognition for his work and skill during his lifetime and after, and is only largely unknown today because so few of his works have survived. Humanist Umberto Decembrio called Michelino ‚Äúthe most distinguished artist of our time.‚Äù Contemporaries referred to Michelino as the \\"supreme painter.\\" Furthermore, The Duke of Berry sent an agent to interview Michelino, who reported that Michelino was ‚Äúthe most excellent painter among all the painters in the world.‚Äù  Major works  *Mystic Marriage of St Catherine, 1420 (Pinacoteca, Siena) *St. Luke Painting the Virgin (Morgan Library and Museum, New York) *Marriage of the Virgin (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) *Fragment of a Historiated Initial from a Choir Book: Christ in Majesty, 1400 (Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland) *Eulogy for Giangaleazzo Visconti, 1403 (Biblioth√®que Nationale, Paris) References External links * St. Luke Painting the Virgin by Michelino Molinari da Besozzo * The Marriage of the Virgin by Michelino Molinari da Besozzo * Christ in Majesty by Michelino Molinari da Besozzo 1385 births 1445 deaths People from the Province of Varese Gothic painters 14th-century Italian painters Italian male painters 15th-century Italian painters ","title":"Michelino Molinari da Besozzo"},{"id":"19180781","text":"James O'Reilly, also known as Seamas O'Reilly, (1916‚Äì1992) was a nationalist politician in Ireland.

Note: Different sources give different numberings for the rounds of the competition: some start round one with the beginning of the regional qualifications; others start numbering from the first national knock-out stage. The former numbering scheme is used in this article. The 1971 final Prior to the changes in the organisation of the competition in 1970, finals were always between North Island and South Island teams. With the reorganisation of the draw, this was no longer the case, and so the 1971 final became the first local derby ever to be played out in the final, with both teams coming from Wellington. In the final, Western Suburbs made up for their defeat the previous year by seeing of neighbours Wellington City, who had been formed as a national league side through a merger of Miramar Rangers and Hungaria. In a howling Wellington southerly wind, Dave Wallace and Allan Jeffrey scored for Suburbs while Paul Cameron and Julius Beck countered for City. With the scores tied, the teams went to extra time, where the game remained locked at 2-2 until the last moments.

Its fossils have been found in Italy and Austria, and it lived during the Late Triassic period, roughly 228 to 201 million years ago. The Langobardisaurus was first discovered by Italian paleontologist Silvio Renesto in 1994 from the Calcare di Zorzino Formation in Northern Italy. Description Neck and skull The Langobardisaurus was a small reptile with a body size shorter than 50 cm. Despite its small size, the Langobardisaurus featured a long neck with elongate cervical vertebrae featuring low neural spines. Atop its long neck, the Langobardisaurus had a large yet short triangular skull that featured a small rostrum and large orbits. Its large orbits are evidence of reliance on visual perception ‚Äì this suggests that the Langobardisaurus likely had good eyesight. The Langobardisaurus skull morphology reflects its unique pattern of dentition. The front part of the upper jaw is toothless, although some grooves on the premaxilla have been mistaken to be teeth in the past despite their lack of enamel.. Past this toothless region of the snout, there were larger tricuspid (three-pronged) cheek teeth on the maxilla and a large molariform tooth which is elongated in anteroposterior direction. This molariform tooth was flattened, with its occluding surface bent inwards and covered with tiny denticles. The lower jaw featured a similar molariform tooth which occluded with the aforementioned upper counterpart. Additionally, the lower jaw was robust and had a high coronoid process which suggests that the capability of a powerful bite. Given this and its distinct tooth pattern, these traits suggest that the Langobardisaurus performed excessive grinding of its food. However, none of the discovered specimens included the jaw articulation, so the conclusions that can be drawn are limited. A dentition pattern as described is certainly unique, and not found in any other 'protorosaur'. In an analysis of the Langobardisaurus jaw and teeth morphology, Renesto and Dalla Vecchia speculated that the Langobardisaurus survived on a diet of large insects, crustaceans, and small fish with tough scales. Additionally, it has been hypothesized that the Langobardisaurus used its long neck to pluck insects out of the air, in addition to burying its head deep into burrows to capture fleeing crustacean prey. Tail The long neck was opposed by an even longer tail, which featured 45 caudal vertebrae ‚Äì making it twice the length of the trunk. Paleontologists hypothesize that the long tail of Langobardisaurus was a key adaptation for the genus that had significant impacts on its daily activity. A long tail allowed the Langobardisaurus to balance its body in a bipedal stance, despite its long neck. Able to stand tall on its hind legs, the Langobardisaurus could have utilized its keen eyesight and long neck (extended vertically) to survey nearby terrain for both predators and prey as shown in the image to the left. Limbs The fossil record shows that the Langobardisaurus featured short forelimbs dwarfed by much longer, hollow hind limbs. The tibia and fibula elements were slightly shorter than the femur. Moving distally, the tarsi were small and compact. These facts suggest that the Langobardisaurus was capable of bipedal locomotion. Bipedal locomotion was undoubtedly a large advantage for the Langobardisaurus - such an adaptation would have allowed the animal to both chase after prey and run from predators. Based on the hypothesis that the Langobardisaurus fed on insects, crustaceans, and fish, the ability to run after prey afforded the Langobardisaurus a significant increase in its hunting capabilities, even if it was only able to run in short bursts. Based on the available morphological and geological information on the genus, paleontologists hypothesize that the Langobardisaurus had adaptation to aquatic life. Rather, the genus likely lived near marine environments - consistent with the proposition that it survived off of crustaceans found in tidal flats. The late Triassic topographical features of the regions in which the specimens were found further support this claim Discovery Fossil in Museo civico di scienze naturali di Bergamo To date, five specimens of Langobardisaurus have been discovered. In addition to the Calcare di Zorzino Formation previously described - which produced two specimens, an additional two Italian specimens were discovered in the Forni Dolostone Formation of Northern Italy. The most recent specimen of Langobardisaurus was found in 2013 in the Seefeld-Formation in the Northern Calcareous Alps of Tyrol Austria. This finding is significant as it expands the paleontological range of the genus, which was previously confined to Northern Italy. Saller et al. described the geological setting: ‚ÄúAll specimens were found in dark limestone and dolomite that formed in relatively small and deep marine basins surrounded by a shallow-water carbonate platform on which the peritidal sediments forming the Dolomia Principale/Hauptdolomit Formation were deposited‚Äù. The aforementioned basins lacked water circulation and ranged from insignificant oxygen levels to totally anoxic - making this environment suitable for preservation of vertebrate bones. Classification and other proposed species There have been three proposed species of Langobardisaurus, though only the first discovered, Langobardisaurus pandolfi, is considered taxonomically significant. The two other proposed species: Langobardisaurus rossii and Langobardisaurus Tonelloi are no longer considered to be unique species of Langobardisaurus. Langobardisaurus is considered to be either the sister-taxon of Tanystropheus or a close relative to Tanystropheus and Macrocnemus. These genera are classified to be a clade of archosauromorph diapsids called Protorosauria, although the clade may be an unnatural grouping. If this is the case, Langobardisaurus, Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, and other close relatives (tanystropheids) may not be closely related to Protorosaurus. Langobardisaurus tonelloi Langobardisaurus tonelloi was first described by Muscio as a new species of Langobardisaurus in 1997 due to observed differences in phalangeal formula and limb bone proportion, though reinvestigation of these features has rendered them to be taxonomically insignificant. Langobardisaurus rossii Langobardisaurus rossii was first described by Bizzarini and Muscio in 1995. However, a detailed review of the specimen by Renesto and Dalla Vecchia led them to conclude that the Langobardisaurus rossii was a lepidosauromorph, and likely a rhynchocephalian.

It was the first release the band had done with Spitfire Records. Co-produced by band members, Chuck Billy and Eric Peterson, this was the first album featuring new musicians Steve DiGiorgio on bass guitar and Dave Lombardo on drums. Billy, Peterson and Lombardo, along with longtime Testament collaborator Del James, are also given composer credits on the album. Release The Gathering featured eleven tracks when it was released, drawing critic and fan acclaim for such songs as \\"D.N.R. (Do Not Resuscitate)\\", \\"Riding the Snake\\", and \\"Legions of the Dead\\". After release Testament embarked on the Riding the Snake World Tour to promote the album with \\"touring\\" lead guitarist Steve Smyth (ex-Vicious Rumors) and Sadus drummer Jon Allen. The tour ended in 2001 shortly before frontman Chuck Billy was diagnosed with cancer. As a result, Testament would not release another studio album until 2008 with The Formation of Damnation, although they did release an album of re-recorded material, First Strike Still Deadly, in 2001. The Gathering is the first of five albums to date featuring engineering and mixing work done with artist and former Sabbat guitarist Andy Sneap. It is also the first of five reissues that Testament has done with Prosthetic Records. The album was reissued January 8, 2008, with an instrumental bonus track, \\"Hammer of the Gods,\\" increasing the new track total to twelve. While \\"Hammer of the Gods\\" is listed on the track listing of the original American release, it does not actually appear on the CD. However, it does appear on the worldwide Prosthetic Records 2008 reissue. Album cover artwork for The Gathering was done by Dave McKean who also did the cover art for the two prior Testament studio albums Demonic and Low. Critical reaction In a 2010 Interview, Chuck Billy describes how the free flow of ideas between Dave Lombardo and Eric Peterson was the \\"key and secret\\" to the album's overall heavier sound in comparison to previous albums. Chuck Billy's aggressive vocal approaches and darker death metal sound were apparent earlier on the last album, Demonic, and continued to be on The Gathering, but it was the range and diversity that the singer achieved on this album that drew the highest acclaim. While the album's songs range from heavier death metal to a more melodic thrash metal, it was the singer's ability to go from his distinct sound to a death metal growl while blending the two that has been noted as trademark Testament. At the time of release, Testament had not done a music video since 1994's Low and was looking at possibly using live footage as a music video to promote The Gathering. Demonic, the band's previous 1997 release, had been handled by a distribution company that went bankrupt to the tune of $44 million which had stranded most retail supply in locked warehouses and off the shelves, seriously hurting the album release. The Gathering reached #48 on the German album charts, its only chart showing, possibly reflecting problems from the prior albums and a lack of coverage rather than weaknesses with the album. Track listing \\"Hammer of the Gods\\" did not appear on the domestic American re-release, though the song title was listed on the album cover. It is an instrumental bonus track originally only available on the Japan reissue; however, it was eventually added to the Prosthetic Records worldwide 2008 re-release.

The company provides junk removal, local and long distance full service moving and office relocation services including in home donation pickup services for non-profit partner organizations. The company became operational in 2005 and began franchising in 2007. The company's services are available to both commercial and residential clients, with over 65% of the \\"junk\\" collected being donated to charities such as Goodwill Industries, recycled, reused or incinerated as fuel through the Covanta Energy Corporation. As of October 2019, College Hunks Hauling Junk and Moving had three company-owned locations and 124 franchised locations in the United States and Canada.  History  College Hunks Hauling Junk began operations in 2004 after co-founder Omar Soliman won $10,000 in the annual Leigh Rothschild Business Plan Contest. Upon graduating from the University of Miami, Soliman and partner Nick Friedman moved to Washington D.C. and expanded the company into a full-scale operation. In its first two years, the company hauled away more than 4,000 tons of junk, and as of 2010 was hauling away an average of 10,000 tons each year. In 2008, the company moved its headquarters to Tampa, Florida and began franchising. The organization expanded and appeared on the Inc magazine's 500 Fastest Growing Companies list in 2009. The company was ranked #30 on Entrepreneur Magazine's Top 50 New Franchise Rankings in 2009. In mass media In September 2008, Friedman and Soliman tried but failed to secure funding from investors for a new business concept called College Foxes Packing Boxes, a full-service packing and professional organizing company. The company attempted to gain an investment of 250k for 25% for the \\"foxes\\", on the ABC investment television show Shark Tank. The investors requested equity in the Hunks, and their offer on the Hunks was $1,000,000 for 10%. The show's investors ultimately rejected the offer, except for Robert Herjavec who offered 250K for 50% of the Foxes and 10% of the Hunks which was later rejected. Soliman and Friedman were contestants in the third- season premiere of Bravo TVs Millionaire Matchmaker hosted by Patti Stanger. Friedman and his girlfriend appeared on HGTV's House Hunters, in an episode aired on July 7, 2013.

The Gerber method is the primary testing method in Europe and much of the world. The fairly similar Babcock test is used primarily in the United States, although the Gerber method also enjoys significant use in the U.S. as well. The Gerber method was developed and patented by Dr. Niklaus Gerber of Switzerland in 1891. Milk fat is separated from proteins by adding sulfuric acid. The separation is facilitated by using amyl alcohol and centrifugation. The fat content is read directly via a special calibrated butyrometer. Gerber developed specialized butyrometers (tubes), pipettes, and centrifuges. Water baths built specifically for the Gerber tubes are often used. The test is still in widespread use today and is the basis for numerous national and international standards such as ISO 2446, International Dairy Federation (FIL) Regulation 105, BS 696 (United Kingdom), and IS 1223 (India). Larger facilities may prefer to use faster analysis techniques such as infrared spectroscopy as these greatly reduce the potential for user error and reduce the time and COSHH requirements. The test continues to be improved and standardized.  Problems likely to be encountered during Gerber butterfat content determination  The two major defects associated with the Gerber method include: # Charring ‚Äì is observed as tiny black specs at the fat/non-fat interface in the butyrometer. This problem is due to charring of the milk proteins by the concentrated Gerber acid. It could also arise as a result of pouring the milk sample directly onto the acid in the butyrometer. To avoid charring, first, ensure the acid concentration is right. Secondly, while adding the milk sample, let it flow on the side of the butyrometer to avoid violent reaction when it drops on the surface of the acid. # Light colored fat column (with or without brown specs at the interface) ‚Äì may affect your ability to read the fat content correctly. This problem is due to weak acid, which fails to dissolve all the milk non-fat content. To avoid this problem, use sufficient volumes of the Gerber acid at the correct concentration.

The brigade briefly existed as a Militia formation prior to the First World War, but this was short lived. During the Second World War, the brigade was raised on 13 October 1939 and was one of the first three infantry brigades of the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) to be formed. Initially commanded by Brigadier Leslie Morshead, it served in the United Kingdom in 1940‚Äì1941, where it helped bolster the British garrison in anticipation of a possible German invasion following the Fall of France. In early 1941, the brigade was transferred to the Middle East where it later took part in fighting against the Italians in Libya and then helped to defend the besieged port of Tobruk before fighting against the Vichy French in the Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign. The 18th Brigade was withdrawn to Australia in early 1942, and it later took part in the fighting against the Japanese in Pacific fighting several campaigns in New Guinea between late 1942 and early 1944. Its final involvement of the war came in mid-1945 when it took part in re-taking Balikpapan. Following the end of hostilities, the 18th Brigade was disbanded on 3 January 1946. History Formation The 18th Brigade briefly existed as Militia brigade that was partially formed in 1912, following the introduction of the compulsory training scheme. At this time, it was assigned to the 3rd Military District. The brigade's constituent units were spread across various locations in Victoria including Williamstown, Geelong, Ballarat, Warrnambool, Harsham and Stawell.Australian Military Forces 1912, p. 23. The formation was short lived, and was not raised as part of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) during the First World War. It remained on the order of battle as a Militia formation during the war,Kuring 2004, p. 108. but was not re-raised in the interwar years when the Militia was reorganised to replicate the numerical designations of the AIF in 1921.Palazzo 2001, pp. 68 & 91.Grey 2008, p. 125. During the Second World War, the 18th Brigade was formed on 13 October 1939 as part of the 6th Division. The brigade's headquarters was opened at Victoria Barracks at Paddington, New South Wales.McKenzie-Smith 2018, p. 2087. Upon formation the brigade consisted of the following infantry battalions: the 2/9th, the 2/10th, the 2/11th and the 2/12th Battalions, which were raised from Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia. Rudimentary training was conducted in home locations, before the brigade came together at Rutherford, New South Wales, in December 1939. This was followed by a further move to Ingleburn, New South Wales. Following training, the brigade was dispatched to the Middle East, departing from Melbourne in May 1940. However, while they were at sea they were diverted to the United Kingdom in order to help defend the island against a possible invasion by German forces following the Fall of France.Johnston 2005, p. 4. After landing at Gourock, Scotland, the brigade moved south to Salisbury Plain where they undertook training and defensive duties. In the United Kingdom, the 18th Brigade provided a cadre to the newly formed 25th Brigade and became part of the 9th Division when it was raised in October 1940. Middle East Later, when the threat of invasion of the United Kingdom decreased, the decision was made to transfer the Australian forces there to the Middle East. The 18th Brigade arrived there in early January 1941.Johnston 2005, p. 6. Around this time, the 2nd AIF was reorganised and each brigade was reduced from four battalions to three. As a result, the 2/11th Battalion was transferred to the 19th Brigade. At the same time also, the 18th Brigade was transferred to the 7th Division.Johnston 2005, pp. 2‚Äì3. Following this, on 21 March 1941, the brigade took part in an attack on an Italian stronghold at Giarabub, south of Bardia.Johnston 2005, p. 22. Although the fortress was held by about 1,500 Italians supported by artillery, the Australian force dispatched only consisted of a reinforced battalion due to supply difficulties. Setting out on 10 March from Siwa, the assault began early on the morning of 21 March from the south over marshy ground.Coulthard- Clark 1998, p. 179. Led by the 2/9th Battalion with machine-gun and mortar support from the 2/12th and 2/10th Battalions, the attack was put in from the south while the 6th Division Cavalry Regiment feigned an attack from the north at the strongest point of the fortress.Coulthard-Clark 1998, p. 180. A heavy sandstorm obscured visibility, which hindered the supporting artillery and resulted in a number of casualties when one company moved beyond the barrage. Nevertheless, heavy fighting followed and resistance continued until 2:00 pm in the afternoon when the Italians surrendered. About 250 Italians were killed and 1,300 captured for the loss of 17 Australians killed and 77 wounded. Following the attack, the 18th Brigade returned to Ikingi Maryut.Johnston 2005, p. 25. Soldiers from the 2/9th hoist a flag consisting of the battalion's unit colour patch over the recently captured Italian fort at Giarabub. Plans were made for the 18th Brigade to deploy to Greece, but a German offensive in Libya resulted in the 7th Division being retained in North Africa. In April, the brigade was sent to Tobruk where they took part in the defence of the port between May and August 1941,Wilmot 1993, pp. 88, 150‚Äì151 and 280. alongside elements of the 9th Division. In May, the Germans managed to break into the Allied perimeter, penetrating towards an area dubbed \\"The Salient\\". The 18th Brigade subsequently led the Australian counterattack in conjunction with the 26th Brigade. Once the perimeter was restored, the brigade rotated through the various defensive sectors around the perimeter until they were relieved by a Polish brigade in August, and withdrawn to Palestine. In September 1941, the brigade rejoined the rest of the 7th Division, which had been taking part in the fighting against Vichy French forces in the Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign.James 2017 Following the armistice the division was allocated the task of undertaking garrison duties and the 18th Brigade was subsequently stationed at Aleppo, near the Turkish border to guard against a potential German attack through Turkey.Johnston 2005, p. 71. Elements of the brigade were also deployed to Idlib, and patrols were mounted along the border. New Guinea The 18th Brigade returned to Australia in early 1942 following the outbreak of the Pacific War.Johnston 2005, p. 77. Following defensive duties and training in Queensland, the 18th Brigade, under the command of Brigadier George Wootten, took part in the Battle of Milne Bay.Brune 2004, p. 279. Deployed with a battery from the 2/5th Field Regiment attached at brigade level,Johnston 2005, p. 85. the 18th Brigade arrived at Milne Bay between 12 and 21 August.Johnston 2005, p. 84. Between 27 August and 7 September the brigade played an important role in the fighting which resulted in the first major defeat of the Japanese on land since the war had begun in December 1941.Johnston 2005, p. 92. One of the brigade's soldiers, Corporal John French, of the 2/9th Battalion, was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his actions during the fighting on 4 September 1942.Johnston 2005, pp. 91‚Äì92. Later, as the 7th Division was assigned to the advance on the Japanese bases on the Papuan coast around Buna and Gona,Johnston 2005, p. 124. the brigade, although understrength, was transferred to Buna in mid-December 1942 with the 2/9th Battalion landing at Oro Bay on 15 December.Johnston 2005, p. 140. On 21 January 1943, the brigade captured Sanananda alongside the US 163rd Infantry Regiment.Keogh 1965, p. 276. They were finally withdrawn back to Australia on 10 March 1943.Johnston 2005, p. 162. During the fighting around Buna, the 18th Brigade suffered 425 men killed and more than 800 wounded. This represented 96 per cent of the brigade's strength at the start of the campaign.Johnston 2005, p. 161. thumb By the time that the brigade returned to Australia, it was down to only 44 per cent of its authorised strength.Johnston 2005, p. 164. In early July, the brigade was brought back up to strength with an intake of 1,300 men from the 1st Motor Brigade, which was subsequently disbanded.Dexter 1961, p. 268. In August 1943, after training and re-organisation around Ravenshoe, Queensland, the 18th Brigade was deployed to Port Moresby in preparation for further operations,Johnston 2005, p. 165. arriving there on 12 August.Dexter 1961, p. 269. During the early phases of the Finisterre Range campaign the brigade remained in reserve around Port Moresby,Bradley 2004, p. 179. while the other two brigades of the 7th Division, the 21st and 25th Brigades, were deployed to defend the approaches to Lae.Johnston 2005, p. 181. They remained there until 4 January 1944 when the brigade was transported by air to Dumpu to relieve the 21st Brigade around Shaggy Ridge,Keogh 1965, p. 352. subsequently taking part in the fighting around the Kankiryo Saddle, Prothero I and II and Crater Hill.Johnston 2005, pp. 196‚Äì205. Following the conclusion of the fighting around Shaggy Ridge in February, the brigade remained in New Guinea until May 1944 when they were withdrawn back to Australia for re-organisation.Johnston 2005, p. 207. Borneo Following the brigade's return to Australia, it was reconstituted at Strathpine, Queensland, before later moving to Kairi. A long period of reorganisation and training followed, before the brigade moved to Morotai, in the Dutch East Indies, May 1945.McKenzie-Smith 2018, p. 2089. The brigade's final involvement in the war came when they landed at Balikpapan in Borneo on 1 July 1945,Keogh 1965, p. 461. as part of efforts to secure the port facilities and oilfields located there. Coming ashore in the first wave, the 18th Brigade was allocated to the landings around Klandasan, on the Allied left. Following the initial landing, the 18th Brigade, supported by 'D' Company, 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion, secured the high ground around Klandasan. On 3 July they captured the town of Balikpapan and secured its port before being relieved by the 25th Brigade.Keogh 1965, p. 462. The 2/9th Battalion was detached, along with the 2/1st Pioneer Battalion, to clear the western side of the bay around Panadjam, while the rest of the brigade undertook further patrols around Balikpapan.Coulthard-Clark 1998, p. 254. By the end of the month, the Australians began mopping up operations, and these continued until the Japanese surrendered. Following the completion of hostilities in August, the brigade remained on Borneo as the demobilisation process began. The 18th Brigade was disbanded on 3 January 1946 at Balikpapan after its component battalions were disbanded throughout December 1945 and January 1946.

His second novel Gone was short-listed for the Queensland Premier's Literary Awards and his third novel Crook as Rookwood won the 2006 Ned Kelly Award, Australia's leading accolade for crime fiction. Nyst launched his career in film with the acclaimed Australian movie Gettin‚Äô Square, starring David Wenham and Sam Worthington, which he wrote and co-produced. The film won Chris the 2003 Lexus IF Award for Best Script and won David Wenham the Best Actor award at the AFI Awards, the Critic's Circle Awards, the Lexus IF Awards and the Australian Comedy Awards. In 2006, Nyst established his own production company Nyst Entertainment and Carbon Studio, which produced the 2007 feature film Crooked Business.

He is married to Julie and has four children, two daughters Carly and Annabelle and two sons Bendon and Jonathan who work in his legal practice.

The two former employees were charged with \\"conducting transactions to avoid reporting requirements and perverting the course of justice\\". It was alleged that the pair of former employees were engaged in \\"stacking\\" which involved conduct intended to avoid transactions being reported to the Federal Government‚Äôs financial intelligence unit. Chris Nyst and his son Brendan filed a defamation claim in the Queensland District Court on 7th August 2020. They claimed that a 22 year old Brisbane man has defamed them by leaving a Google review about Nyst Legal, the law firm they are both directors of. According to the claim filed with the Court, the review contained no text and was a \\"one-star rating\\". They alleged that the review was defamatory because it implied Nyst Legal ‚Äúprovide poor service and should be avoided, are unprofessional, inept and the quality of work they produce is poor‚Äù.

The service is designed to promote effective and efficient information sharing, providing governance, tools, methods and re-usable technical components across Australian government. govdex is managed by the Australian Government Information Management Office (AGIMO), in the Department of Finance and Deregulation (Australia). A major component of govdex is a wiki-based framework and other collaboration tools. These tools enable Australian Government entities to establish online communities of practice and manage collaborative initiatives across government and non-government stakeholders.  govdex principles/tenets  The primary govdex principles/tenets are: * govdex avoids duplicating technical interoperability work already done at state and federal levels.

In the first session with Blood, she predicted their marriage and he promptly proposed even though he was still married to his first wife, Mary Ann Clapp Harrington. Woodhull was also married at the time, and once both divorces were complete, the couple left St. Louis in 1865, moving through Midwestern cities before reaching New York City in 1867. Woodhull, in denouncing the crusades that had provided her with national attention, abandoned Blood in 1876, to try to regain her respectability. His only public response was, \\"The grandest woman in the world went back on me.\\" They divorced later that year.

Guayr√° was a historical region of the Spanish Empire, located in the Governorate of Paraguay, within the colonial Viceroyalty of Peru. The region is located in present-day Paraguay and Paran√°. There are some conflicting etymologies for the origin of the name, with some claiming it was named after a cacique of the region whose name was Guayr√° or Guayrac√°. Alternatively, the word might come from Guarani \\"kwa y ra\\" (\\"can not pass\\", \\"impassable\\") or even \\"guay ra\\" (\\"river that goes [beyond]\\"). Geography The limits of Guayr√° were the Iguazu River on the south, the Paran√° River on the west, the Tiete (or A√±emby) River to the north, and the line of the Treaty of Tordesillas to the east. The Tiete also marked the boundary between the Tupi and Guarani Indians. Aleixo Garcia crossed the region in 1522. In 1542, Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca travelled through its southern reaches on his way to Asunci√≥n from Santa Catarina Island.

It was located on the left bank of the Paran√°, between the Iguazu and Pipiri-Guazu, about north of Salto del Guair√°, in the territory of the cacique Canendiyu.

It is on the left bank of the Paran√° at the confluence of the Pipiry-Guazu.

The developers were licensed to use concepts from Neuromancer, reflected in the virtual-reality cyberspace concept and theme of a powerful corporation. The game is considered an early first-person shooter, pre-dating Catacomb 3-D and Wolfenstein 3D. However, the game primarily focuses on puzzle-solving using the interaction between a 3D cyberpunk environment and its conceptual relationship with a 2D zoomable blueprint in which a non-player character is indirectly guided through the floors of a high-security building. Later games that have a similar style to the 3D elements in Interphase include Pyrotechnica and Rez. Storyline In the future, automation of most jobs has led to boredom, which in turn has led to a boom in the leisure industry. DreamTracks, created by Dreamers who work for multi-national corporations, are recorded patterns of imagination. The general public then view these DreamTracks as a form of entertainment. The player, Chad a Dreamer discovers that subliminal messages are being inserted into DreamTracks to persuade consumers to buy certain products and more worryingly, to push certain political viewpoints and pro-government propaganda. Using a human to computer interface, known as an Interphase, Chad sets out to destroy a particularly dangerous DreamTrack stored in a high security building. He has asked his girlfriend, Kaf-E to physically break into the building while he virtually infiltrates the computer to disable computer controlled defences and security systems. Gameplay The action mostly takes place in two modes: a 3D cyberpunk environment and a 2D schematic map where puzzles are encountered. 3D objects in the cyberpunk environment represent objects such as security doors and cameras. To disable the real-world devices, the 3D objects must be destroyed. Puzzle-solving involves determining which objects to disable and in what order. The player must also deal with virtual defences, represented by enemy ships which pose a threat to the player's ability to jack in to the system, and which must be defeated. While viewing the 2D schematic, the action in the 3D world continues, so it's essential that enemy ships have been dispensed with before puzzle-solving can proceed. Otherwise, the player becomes a sitting duck. The player controls Chad in the 3D section of the game while in the 2D section Kaf-E follows a path throughout the building and attempts to reach the lift to the next level, messaging Chad if she encounters an obstacle or notices something that could assist. The player's main goal is to disable/manipulate the real world objects and security to allow Kaf-E to progress safely without getting killed by traps or caught by the security bots, as well as ensuring his virtual craft is not destroyed by the defenses. Allowing either his own craft to be destroyed or Kaf-E's safety compromised will result in a game over. The game was ranked the 38th best game of all time by Amiga Power.Amiga Power magazine issue 0, Future Publishing, May 1991 Graphical style In-game screenshot (Atari ST) The 2D environment is a polygon-based schematic closely resembling an animated blueprint. A very deep zoom-in is possible and necessary. The progress of Kaf-E and the positions of moving objects (e.g., security guards) and fixed objects such as cameras can all be monitored in this view. The 3D environment is a first-person view from the front of a virtual ship navigating a multiple-level environment. The virtual levels do not represent the floors of the building, they simply represent parts of the computer system. Navigation between levels is accomplished by flying through square panels.

The large conference table is today preserved at the Museum Meiji Mura in Inuyama, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. The Wentworth was built in 1874 by Daniel Chase, a distiller from Somerville, Massachusetts, and for the first two years was named Wentworth Hall. It was bought by Frank Jones in 1879 and expanded in the Second Empire style. With Jones's death, the hotel was sold in 1902. In 1905, the hotel housed the Russian and Japanese delegations who concluded the Treaty of Portsmouth to end the Russo-Japanese War. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt suggested the peace talks, and won the Nobel Peace Prize for his actions. Both delegations were welcomed at no charge, with Frank Jones' executor Judge Calvin Page providing hospitality as Jones' will stipulated he should. The final document was signed at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard where formal negotiations took place, but the final language of the treaty was drafted, and the armistice ending the fighting, was signed at The Wentworth. In addition, the Japanese hosted an \\"International Love Fest\\" at the hotel on the signing. After a number of owners, Harry Beckwith bought the hotel in 1920 and ran it for 25 years.

He was possibly a member of the failed expedition of Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s, seeking to find a passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. After reaching the mouths of the Uruguay and Paran√°, it was apparent that the Rio de la Plata was not such a strait. At this point, Sol√≠s was killed ‚Äì on testimony of his crew ‚Äì by cannibal Indians (variously identified as the Charr√∫a or Guaran√≠) and his lieutenants opted to return to Spain. On their return, some of their boats were shipwrecked off Santa Catarina in present-day Brazil. Among the 11 or 18 Spanish and Portuguese survivors was Aleixo Garcia, a Portuguese adventurer who had previously made contact with the Guaran√≠. With them were also the Portuguese sailors Henrique Montes (a veteran of the Gon√ßalo Coelho and Amerigo Vespucci expeditions) and Francisco Pacheco, and the Spanish sailor Melchior Ram√≠rez. Alejo de Ledesma and Francisco Chaves were also among them. Melchior Ram√≠rez, in turn, would assist and guide Crist√≥v√£o Jacques on his voyage of exploration to R√≠o de la Plata and the Parana river in 1521, returning again to Santa Catarina. Aleixo Garcia traveled inland, living among the Guaran√≠s who knew of the network of trails called Peabiru that covered this part of South America. While there, he heard tales of a \\"White King\\" who lived to the west, ruling cities of incomparable riches and splendor. After eight years, Garcia had gathered enough men and supplies to attempt a voyage to the land of the \\"White King.\\" Marching towards the west, using the trail network Peabiru, his company discovered a great waterfall. Credit for the discovery of the Iguazu Falls is usually given to the governor Alvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca, and historian Efra√≠m Cardozo asserts Garcia crossed the Paran√° at the smaller waterfall called Saltos del Monday. In 1524 and 1525, the small group (four or five men, or more than a dozen, depending on the sources) recruited an army of about 2,000 local Guaran√≠ soldiers from the vicinity of Asunci√≥n as reinforcement to invade the promising new land. They then entered the Chaco, a rough semi- desert region. Garcia was the first European to cross the Chaco and even managed to penetrate the outer defenses of the Inca Empire on the hills of the Andes, in present-day Bolivia. He was the first European to do so, accomplishing this eight years before Francisco Pizarro. Garcia looted an impressive booty of silver. When the army of Huayna C√°pac arrived to challenge him, Garcia then retreated with the spoils, only to be assassinated by his Indian allies near San Pedro on the Paraguay River. The Indians, however, spared the life of his son, who was the first Paraguayan mestizo. News of this excursion into Incan territory later distracted Sebastian Cabot from his expedition to the East Indies (which could have resulted in the second circumnavigation of the globe after Ferdinand Magellan) causing him to imprison or maroon his lieutenants and remain in the Rio de la Plata region for several years.

The dispute stemmed from the 1963 murder of a California Highway Patrol (CHP) officer following a bank robbery committed by Burns and two other men. Burns was on parole out of Oregon for attempted robbery at the time. When the CHP officer pulled over the group's getaway car, one of the other men shot and killed him. Although he did not harm the officer personally, under the felony murder rule, Burns was charged with murder. He pled guilty and was sentenced to life in prison in California. After five years in prison in California, Burns was transferred to Oregon to finish his sentence for the attempted robbery charge, with the expectation that he would be returned to California when that sentence was finished. While imprisoned in Oregon, he rehabilitated himself to such a degree that at the end of his sentence, then-governor Robert W. Straub refused to return him to California. Burn settled in Eugene under his own name and lived without further incident until California officials began to make efforts to extradite him to California in 2001. He contested the extradition and died at home at the age of 71 before the matter was settled.  Early life  Burns was born in Oklahoma during the Great Depression. He described his father as an abusive alcoholic who abandoned Burns, his eleven siblings, and his wife, leaving them in dire poverty. He was kicked out of his home with a fourth-grade education at eleven years old and joined the United States Army at sixteen. Despite being involved in several minor incidents of violence while serving, he was honorably discharged. From there, he turned to petty theft, for which he was arrested. He fled jail and worked his way to Bakersfield, California, where he began to rob convenience stores with his brother across several states. They were eventually arrested in San Francisco in 1954 for charges stemming from eight different states. Most of the charges were dropped, except for those from Oregon; Burns was extradited to Oregon to serve a twenty-year sentence for attempted robbery. He was paroled after nine years.  Bank robbery and murder in California  In November 1963, Burns and two partners, Roger Mealman and Clifford Toycen Jr, robbed a Bank of America in Sacramento, California for $45,000. Burns acted as the driver of the getaway car. At the time, he was on parole for an attempted robbery in Oregon from 1955. While speeding away from the area in a white Cadillac convertible bearing stolen plates, the men were pulled over in Truckee, California by California Highway Patrol officer Glenn W. Carlson. Officer Carlson initially wrote the men a speeding ticket and let them go, but realized shortly after that their plates were stolen and that the men matched the description that had been broadcast of the robbery suspects. Officer Carlson gave chase and pulled the men over a second time. During the ensuing disturbance, Mealman shot and killed the 33-year-old Carlson. He also wounded Burns by mistake. The men fled the scene, but the three were arrested days later. Mealman, Burns, and Toycen were all charged with murder under the felony murder rule, which assigns collective responsibility for killings committed in the commission of a violent crime. The men all pled guilty to murder in order to avoid the death penalty. All three were sentenced to life in prison in 1964. At his sentencing, the judge told Burns, \\"I can see a constructive individual in you.\\" Burns later described the judge's compassion as the moment he went \\"from bad to good.\\"  Prison and parole in Oregon  Burns was incarcerated in California's Folsom State Prison for four and a half years Burns spent four and a half years in California's Folsom State Prison before being transferred to Oregon State Penitentiary to serve out the remainder of his Oregon conviction; at the time, transferring prisoners between states in this way was a routine practice. Officials from California had placed a detainer on him and were under the impression that Burns would be returned to them at the conclusion of that sentence, as was standard practice at the time. While imprisoned in Oregon, Burns suffered a serious illness that almost killed him. Recalling the judge's decision to spare him from the death penalty, he decided to turn his life around. He earned his high school diploma, took courses from the University of Pennsylvania and University of California by correspondence, and read extensively in an array of subjects. He learned several trade and technical skills, including masonry and painting. He worked with his brother to start a vacuum-cleaning business, despite being in prison. He was reduced to minimal custody status and given escorted day passes to give motivational talks at schools and community centres. Finally, he gathered approximately 50 recommendation letters supporting his parole efforts from prison personnel like guards, counsellors, and even the prison warden. In 1975, he was paroled again on the original attempted robbery charge from Oregon. The governor of Oregon, Robert W. Straub, considered him rehabilitated and refused to sign the warrant to return him to California. California officials, including then- governor Ronald Reagan, protested and called for Burns to be returned to California. At the time, they had no authority to force Straub to return Burns; prior to the 1987 Supreme Court case Puerto Rico v. Branstad, there was no way to force an unwilling state to extradite a person. Mealman and Toycen were also paroled in California in the 1970s.  Intervening years  Burns remained in Oregon, living openly under his legal name and making no attempt to conceal his criminal history. He married, fathered several children, and remained a law-abiding citizen. Burns was arrested on fugitive warrants in 1982 and 1983, while traveling for business in Nevada and Alaska, respectively, but California officials did not follow through on these extradition attempts and nothing came of them. Although Governor Straub had refused to return Burns to California at his release, the 1987 Supreme Court decision Puerto Rico v. Branstad ruled that the federal courts have the power to enforce interstate extraditions, even against the wishes of the governors of involved states. Despite the change, California did not actively attempt to have Burns extradited until 2001. By that time, Burns was 70 years old and suffering a number of serious ailments, including heart disease and prostate cancer.  2001 extradition dispute  Burns's case returned to prominence in 2001, when California officials discovered Burns's name on a list of fugitives during a \\"routine review\\" of their records. California officials sought extradition so Burns could serve out the remainder of his California sentence, a move opposed by Burns and his lawyer. California officials had expected Burns to be returned after his Oregon sentence was complete, as was standard at the time. Because he was never returned, the position taken by the state of California was that legally, Burns was a fugitive, as he had neither served the remainder of his California prison sentence, nor had he officially been released on parole by the state of California. Stephen Green of the California Youth and Adult Correctional Agency was quoted in 2001 as saying, \\"We are required by statute to pursue all fugitives,\\" although he conceded that \\"previous administrations didn't look very hard.\\" California officials intended to bring Burns back to California for a parole hearing with the California parole board once apprehended.  Arrest  Lane County jail in Eugene, where Burns was held pending bail. He was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on January 4, 2001, and was held in the Lane County jail in Eugene until March 23, when a lawyer paid his $10,000 bail. During his incarceration, he was hospitalized three times due to his failing health. He remained in Oregon, appealing the process through a public defender. His lawyer advanced several arguments against his extradition, including the argument that Burns, having been brought to Oregon as prisoner, had not left California voluntarily in the first place. Phillips later argued that returning Burns to California would effectively be \\"a death sentence\\" because of his health concerns. Phillips suggested that Burns would not be eligible for immediate compassionate release, and it would be at least six months before a parole hearing would be held, during which he was likely to die. Burns said that he did not expect to live past those six months, and would prefer to die with his family. He expressed remorse for the murder, stating \\"What happened on that highway was a tragedy. That poor officer lost his life, and a lot of other lives were devastated too. I think about it every day. And I've apologized in every way I know how.\\" An electronic ankle monitor of a similar type to what Burns was issued on release In March 2001, Oregon governor John Kitzhaber wrote a letter to California governor Gray Davis, asking Davis to drop the matter, although Kitzhaber did acknowledge that the law favored California's position. Davis responded by saying that Burns was still considered a fugitive, and that it would be inappropriate for his office to intervene while he remained \\"at large\\" in Oregon. In April 2001, Lane County circuit judge Bryan Hodges denied Burns's motion for a stay of extradition. He commended Burns for his upstanding life and clean record, but found that the law showed no alternative to extradition. Officers from the California Department of Corrections (CDC) took custody of Burns and loaded him into a prison van to transport him south towards the California border. In the meantime, Burns's lawyer won an emergency stay of extradition \\"pending a review of Mr. Burns's case by the Oregon Court of Appeals\\". The CDC van was pulled over by Oregon State Police officers just outside of Medford, Oregon, about from the California border. Burns was returned to Medford, but officials in Jackson County refused to lodge him in their jail, citing his extreme medical issues. State Police then transported Burns back to Lane County jail, and he was eventually released with an electronic ankle monitor.  Reactions and legacy  Family and friends of Officer Carlson objected to Burns remaining in Oregon, and stated that he should return to California. In an interview, Carlson's son Eric, who was barely four years old when his father died, stated in an interview that he sympathized with Burns's family potentially losing a loved one, but that he still believed that Burns should return to California to stand before the parole board for a hearing. In contrast, Burns's family labelled the extradition attempt \\"cruel and unreasonable,\\" citing his age and serious health issues, as well as his exemplary post-prison record. Oregon authorities confirmed that Burns had not had any negative law enforcement contact since his release, not even minor infractions such as speeding tickets. Burns died at home in Springfield, Oregon on January 22, 2002 without having been returned to California. He was 71 years old and had prostate cancer and heart disease. Although his case was still pending, his family told him it had been settled and removed his monitoring bracelet. His former sister-in-law, Tami Ferguson, stated, \\"We wanted him to die thinking he was a free man.\\" A bypass over California State Route 267 near Old Brockway Road in Truckee is named the CHP Officer Glenn Carlson Memorial Bypass in Carlson's memory. A memorial ceremony was held in November 2013 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Carlson's death.

(2005). \\"A New Skull of the Cochleosaurid Amphibian Chenoprosopus (Amphibia: Temnospondyli) from the Early Permian of New Mexico\\". New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin No. 30 Two known species of Chenoprosopus are C. milleri and C. lewisi. Chenoprosopus lewisi was described in the basis of a virtually complete skull with maximum skull length of 95 mm. It is significantly smaller than Chenoprosopus milleri and was differentiated from that taxon by Hook (1993) based on sutural patterns of the skull roof. Hook also mentioned the reduced size of the vomerine tusks differentiated C. lewisi from C. milleri, but the different size of these tusks may be different ontogenetic stages of growth. Many of other cochleosaurids from the same time period have an elongated vomer and wide and elongate choana. However, Chenoprosopus is distinguished by its more narrowly pointed snout and separation between the nasal from the maxilla by the broad lacrimal-septomaxilla contact. The Chenoprosopus name means as ‚Äúgoose short face‚Äù based on Greek cheno as a goose and prosopus as a short face.  Description and paleobiology  The skull of Chenoprosopus measures from 95 mm to 305 mm length from the tip of the snout to the back of the skull. The pineal foramen is present skull of over 120 mm length.Mehl, M. G. (1913). A description of Chenoprosopus milleri. Publications of the Carnegie Institute, Washington, 186, 11-16. Analysis of the remains is inhibited because, although the anterior third and the left side to the median line are complete, the loss of the upper posterior border of the skull (prevents us from understanding something about the critter). Fragments from the right are so badly crushed and so incomplete that they are little use to determine the position of the teeth. However, the skull of Chenoprosopus is distorted and slightly compressed laterally and much of the sutures and pitting is not disturbed. The Chernoprosopus was a carnivore. Mehl suggested that Chenoprosopus fed on soft organisms such as worms and the larvae of large insects of its time. There are several indications that suggest Chenoprosupus had a terrestrial life. Mehl states that the laterally directed orbits of Chenoprosopus is strongly suggestive of its terrestrial life. Also, the absence of lateral line sulci on the roof of the skull and the well ossified qualities of the postcranial skeleton also support the notion that they had a terrestrial life. The primitive tetrapod, Acanthostega gunnari (Jarvik, 1952), presents a direct biting of prey feeding mechanism and demonstrates the terrestrial mode of feeding. Unlike most terrestrial feeders among temnospondyli, Chenoprosopus, which lived in dry environments, displayed weaker bite capabilities than Nigerpeton, which presents strong bite capabilities. The skull of Chenoprosopus presented stresses in the posterior part of the skull than in the rest of the skull because of weak bite capabilities that could be the adductor musculature beneath the squamosal bones.  Skull  Chenoprosopus milleri skull The skull is long and narrow broadly rounded anteriorly with the sides diverging slightly and regularly in the anterior four-fifths of the length. The orbit of Chenoprosopus milleri is nearly round and is about 32 mm. in diameter. It is smaller than Nigerpeton ricqlesi. The orbits are positioned midway along the skull length and widely spaced. The plane of the orbit is parallel with the lateral margin of the skull and is directed out and slightly upward. The orbit depression extends back and slightly down for a short distance from the middle of the posterior border and lies a little behind the naris and in a line with the orbit and the naris. The naris has a rounded and is approximately 10 mm wide and 7 mm long. The shape of nasals are large, rectangular, and about three times as long as wide. It is placed near the lateral margin of the skull and about 50 mm behind the tip of the rostrum. Its plane is directed out and upward. The otic notch is deep, open fully posteriorly and separated from the supratemporal and squamosal. The jugal is a large element extending from the anterior border of the orbit back at least as far as the ear opening. The upper side of the quadrate is thin, with plate-like bone extending up and forward as if to connect with the skull just above the otic notch. The septomaxillae are small, triangular elements, fully twice as long as wide, and form nearly the entire posterior border of the naris. It extends back between the nasals and the maxilla, but are apparently separated from the lachrymals by a considerable space. The premaxilla of Chenoprosopus number approximately 20 (Hook, 1993) and have a short contact with the maxilla at the skull margin. The maxilla is excluded from the narial opening by the septomaxilla. The bases of the maxillary teeth are placed closely to the external margin of the maxilla. The estimated minimum number of maxillary tooth positions is 34. The first two maxillary teeth are smaller than the adjacent position of the premaxillary dentition tooth size. These teeth have relatively narrow, round bases, recurved distal halves, and sharply pointed ends. Also, the maxilla is excluded from the narial opening by the septomaxilla. A short maxilla-nasal suture is evident on both sides of the skull, followed by contacts with the lacrimal and jugal.  Palate  Palate is flat and an elongated choana that nearly reaches the level of the anterior limit of the interpterygoid vacuities. The lateral margin of the choana is not exposed, the opening lacks the anterior expansion and a round shape. Anterior palatal fossil occurs on the vomers as modest concavities separated by a thin longitudinal septum. The conjoined palatines and pterygoids are broad and have a long, comparatively narrow interpterygoid vacuity. The posterior processes of the pterygoids are curved inward to join the quadrate. The posterior pterygoid process extends upward in a thin plate, including a large infra-temporal vacuity. The length of each interpterygoid vacuity is approximately three times greater than its width, or equal to about a third of the skull length. The interpterygoid vacuities set back in posterior half of skull. The vacuities widen and become broadly rounded near the level of the basal process. Small ossicles filling the interpterygoid vacuity indicate there was a plate of denticles in the vacuities. (cite Montanari). The vomerin tusks are larger and placed in a more lateral position. At the posterolateral margin of the choana, a second palatal tusk is present on the palatine and is accompanied by a replacement pit; the basal diameter of this tusk is slightly greater than that of the largest maxillary tooth.  Discovery  The cochleosaurid amphibian Chenoprosopus was discovered in El Cobre Canyon Formation near the Miller bone bed in the vicinity of Arroyo del Agua, north-central New Mexico by Mr. Paul C. Miller and established as a new genus based on an incomplete skull by Mehl in 1913. The skull was long and narrow, long and wide. The teeth were stout and conical, slightly recurved and about long. A single vertebra was also found at the site and this resembled the vertebrae of Diadectes. Chenoprosopus lewisi was described by Hook, 1993, from the Permo-Carboniferous Markley Formation in Texas.  Classification  Chenoprosopus belongs to clade Edopoidea, a superfamily of temnospondyl. Edopoidea has several primitive characteristics of temnospondyls.

It acts as an inverse agonist at the Œ±1, Œ±2, Œ±3 and Œ±5 subtypes, but with much higher affinity for Œ±5, and unlike newer Œ±5 inverse agonists such as Œ±5IA, L-655,708 exerts its subtype selectivity purely via higher binding affinity for this receptor subtype, with its efficacy as an inverse agonist being around the same at all the subtypes it binds to. A radiolabelled form of L-655,708 was used to map the distribution of the GABAA Œ±5 subtype in the brain, and it was found to be expressed predominantly in the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with learning and memory. Activation of this subtype is thought to be largely responsible for producing the cognitive side effects displayed by many benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine drugs, such as amnesia and difficulties with learning and memory, and so this led researchers to conclude that a drug acting as an inverse agonist at this subtype should have the opposite effect and enhance learning and memory. L-655,708 was indeed found to produce improved cognitive performance in animal studies, without producing the side effect of convulsions which is produced by non-selective inverse agonists like DMCM. However it was found to be anxiogenic at doses which enhanced cognition, most likely because of its inverse agonist effects on other subtypes such as Œ±2 and Œ±3, making it unlikely that this drug would be suitable for use as a nootropic in humans. Still, L-655,708 may find use in the clinic to combat postoperative cognitive dysfunction since administration of sub-nootropic doses of L-655,708 prevented persistent memory impairment in mice anesthetized with isoflurane. A recent study found that L-655,708, and another Œ±5 subunit-containing GABAA receptor-selective negative allosteric modulator, MRK-016, produced rapid, ketamine-like antidepressant effects in animal models of depression.

Three of her sonnets survive in a single manuscript, and one is half of a tenzone. Compiuta may be her given name, but more probably a senhal (code name). Her full name translates \\"the accomplished young lady from Florence\\". Her existence was once in doubt and she was considered a construct of the poets, but this view has been discarded. In A la stagion che 'l mondo foglia e fiora (\\"In the season when the world sends forth leaves and flowers\\"), Compiuta complains of her father's choice of a husband for her. She is miserable at springtime, when other lovers are rejoicing. In Lasciar voria lo mondo e Dio servire (\\"I would like to leave the world to serve God\\"), she bemoans the state of the world: lack of nobility, meanness of spirit, and dishonesty. She desires to enter a convent, but her father will not let her. In her only tenzone, Ornato di gran pregio e di valenza, with an admiring man who wishes to meet her, she responds with pleasant interest. The famous Italian poet Guittone d'Arezzo, who mentions her by name in his fifth letter, may have addressed it to her. Compiuta's vocabulary was influenced by her knowledge of Occitan literature and the work of the troubadours. Thus, she contrasts cortesia (courtliness) with villania (villainy), terms borrowed from the setting of aristocratic court. Fin pregio (courtly virtue) and fin'amanti (courtly lovers) are in the courtly love tradition. Compiuta may have had access to the poems of the trobairitz. Her place as a very early vernacular poet was not ignored by contemporaries. Mastro Torrigiano wrote two sonnets about her: one wondering whether she was unnatural (for her sex) or miraculous (\\"a divine sibyl\\"), a second praising her for surpassing the norms of her sex.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 28, 2008. After getting charged for being involved in a fight, Homer meets bail bondsman Lucky Jim and Wolf the Bounty Hunter, who convince him to become a bounty hunter. In a twisted turn of events, he becomes Ned Flanders' partner. Meanwhile, Marge unknowingly begins working at an erotic bakery. Julia Louis-Dreyfus returns as Snake's girlfriend Gloria for the third time. Robert Forster provides the voice of Lucky Jim, and Joe Mantegna returns as Fat Tony in the episode. It was watched by 9.3 million viewers the night it aired. Plot An alcohol-free Springfield Saint Patrick's Day parade is interrupted by a brawl between the Nationalist Irish and the Unionist Northern Irish in which Homer participates. A group of hungry children steal Marge's picnic basket. She is saved by Patrick Farrelly, who gives the children a cabbage and returns the basket. Marge offers him a cupcake in gratitude, and Patrick immediately offers her a job at his bakery after eating it. Homer is taken to jail, because of his involvement in the riot. Due to his history of crime, Homer's bail is set incredibly high, and he is forced to get a bail bondsman named Lucky Jim to help him. Lucky Jim agrees to secure Homer's release from prison, as long as Homer does not skip his bail. Otherwise, he will have to deal with Wolf the Bounty Hunter, who quickly inspires Homer to become a bounty hunter himself. Homer's first mission involves pretending to sell condos on a street corner to criminals. Snake approaches Homer, who tries to take Snake down. Homer corners Snake in an alleyway, where Snake pulls out a pistol and fires a shot straight to Homer's head. Miraculously, Ned Flanders places a sheet of bulletproof glass in front of Homer, which deflects the shot. Ned attempts to convince Snake to come in quietly, unknowingly allowing Homer to sneak up behind Snake and capture him by asphyxiating him with a plastic bag. Homer convinces Ned to join him as a bounty hunting duo. At the bakery, Marge realizes that Patrick employed her at an erotic bakery after seeing Patty and Selma pick out a suggestively-shaped cake. Marge tries to quit, but Patrick says that there is nothing wrong with what he is doing, and that many of her friends have bought cakes from the store. Patrick informs Marge that she has a gift, and Marge agrees to stay. Meanwhile, Homer and Ned are successfully pursuing several bail-jumpers. Homer, now richer, spoils his family with gifts. Marge is equally proud of her job. That evening, Homer and Ned conduct a stakeout, hoping to take in Fat Tony. When he emerges next morning, Homer and Ned chase him around Springfield and eventually capture him by crashing their car into a subway car. Disgusted by Homer's lawless capture, Ned angrily quits. Ned tries to get out of the bounty-hunting business, but agrees to hunt for Homer after Lucky Jim informs Ned that Homer has skipped his bail, while being too distracted with his new job. At first, Ned still refuses, but after he sees the other \\"options\\" of Jim (a number of amoral and sociopathic Bounty Hunters) Ned fears for Homer's sake and decides to arrests Homer by himself. When Homer arrives home to find Ned waiting for him, Homer declares that Ned will never take him alive. A long parkour chase ensues, ending with the two on a beam suspended high over the ground. Homer wails that he loved Ned, but Ned counters that Homer mostly hated him. Homer scoffs that it was only because Ned holds onto his resentments. Homer jumps onto another beam, but Ned fails to land on it, gripping onto the edge of the beam. He begs Homer for help, which causes Homer to flash back to all the good times he and Ned had together; Homer finally helps Ned, but ends up tumbling over the edge of the beam himself. Shrieking, he and Ned end up landing in a pool of wet cement ‚Äì which unfortunately sets before they can get out. Chief Wiggum arrives to put Homer away, but in jail, Homer has been sentenced to a short stay. On the last night of his sentence, he receives a cake from Marge to \\"help get him through his sentence\\". He opens it to find a regular pink and white frosted sheet cake that simply says \\"to the love of my life\\". At the same time, Sideshow Bob escapes from the Springfield Penitentiary. Cultural references The episode title is an allusion to Steven Soderbergh's 1989 directorial debut Sex, Lies, and Videotape. Robert Forster guest stars as bail bondsman Lucky Jim in the episode, the same job his character held in the 1997 film Jackie Brown. The bail bondsman Wolf is a parody of Duane \\"Dog\\" Chapman, the star of the series Dog the Bounty Hunter, while one of the bounty hunters lining up to chase Homer down, before Ned takes the job, is Rose McGowan's character Cherry Darling from Robert Rodriguez's 2007 film Planet Terror. In the opening St. Patrick's Day brawl, Marvel Comics characters The Thing and The Incredible Hulk have cameos, while before that Bart notes that he misses the IRA, a reference to the ending of their armed campaign in 2005. When Homer reminisces about the good times he and Ned had, one clip shows the two of them in a Batman-esque fight scene. The episode's couch gag parodies The Empire Strikes Back, with Boba Fett appearing and carrying away the family frozen in carbonite as he had done to Han Solo.Bates, et al., p. 1024 The episode features several musical references. Homer and Ned's song \\"Kindly Deeds Done For Free\\" is a parody of \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\" by AC/DC. Lisa sings \\"Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral\\" to calm the fighting Irish, the Eddy Grant song \\"Electric Avenue\\" accompanies the montage of Homer and Ned hunting criminals. Homer and Ned chasing the subway is a reference to The French Connection. Reception It was watched by 9.3 million people making it the most-watched Fox cartoon of the night beating Family Guy which was second with 9.2 million viewers. Robert Canning of IGN called it a \\"decent, if fun start to the twentieth season\\". In the end, he gave a final rating of 7.2/10. Joel Brown of \\"MeeVee\\" gave the episode a B-. Justin Gagnon of The Daily Collegian called the episode \\"worthwhile viewing for both big fans and occasional watchers and proves that even after 20 seasons the show still can dish up some fresh laughs.\\" Screen Rant called it the best episode of the 20th season. Controversy The episode stirred controversy in Northern Ireland over the brawl that occurred in the opening act of the episode. The brawl, between Irish and Northern Irish people, included Bart's line \\"Where are the IRA when you need them?\\" Gregory Campbell, a Northern Irish MP for East Londonderry in Northern Ireland said \\"The Simpsons is a humorous cartoon but the context of using a line like that about an organisation which caused so much death will lead people to have very mixed views, some people may take it as a light- hearted reference, while others who were affected by the real life violence of the IRA and are still suffering with that legacy, will not.\\" The line is usually cut from UK broadcasts of the episode.

The animal was a predator that lived about 260 million years ago, and could get up to about 3 meters in length. Specifically, Konzukovia lived during the Permian, between 252 and 270 million years ago according to the type of rock the fossil was found in. There are three species within this genus, K. vetusta, K. tarda, and K. sangabrielensis, the first two originating from Russia while the latest originating from Southern Brazil. The discovery of this specimen in Southern Brazil provided more evidence to support the idea that during this animals existence, there was a ‚Äúbiological corridor‚Äù because of the supercontinent Pangea, allowing these species to be found so far apart from each other. Konzhukovia belongs to the family Archegosauridae, a family consisted of large temnospondyls that most likely compare to modern day crocodiles. Since the discovery of the latest species, K. sangabrielensis Pacheco proposes that there must be the creation of a new family, Konzhokoviidae, a monophyletic group in a sister-group relationship with Stereospondlyi in order to accommodate the three species. Konzhukovia skulls usually exhibit typical rhinesuchid features including an overall parabolic shape, small orbits located more posteriorly, and the pterygoids do not reach the vomer. These animals were long-snouted amphibians that had clear adaptations made for fish catching, as well as exemplifying aquatic features.  Etymology  The name Konzhukovia, was given because of its ‚Äúrhinesuchid- like‚Äù temnospondyl properties. It was assigned the name Konzohuvia by Schoch and Milner. The specific name sangabrielensis (a species type) is derived from the municipality where the specimen was recovered in southern Brazil.  Paleobiology  The Konzhukovia skull has an overall triangular appearance due to the lateral margins of the snout expanding parallel and then diverging from each other and the most anterior portion of the snout is rounded. The skull contains both infra- and supraorbital sensory sulci, the infraorbital sulcus is located on the maxilla and runs posteriorly to the lacrimal while the supraorbital sulcus extends posteriorly to the naris. The orbits are elongate and the skull shows paired anterior palatal vacuity. The orbits are positioned after the midline of the skull and are relatively widely separated from each other. The skull contains pleurodont dentition and the maxilla and premaxilla of recovered specimens carry evidence of more than 30 teeth. The tooth row runs straight between the vomerine fangs, the vomerine tusks and palatine tusks are equal in size, and the maxillary teeth are anteroposteriorly compressed. Comparing the three species, K. sangabrielensis was almost twice the size of both K. tarda and K. vetusta and appeared to be very robust in overall shape. Pacheco used phylogenetic inference to infer that K. sangabrielensis was missing the septomaxilla due to fact that the absence of this bone is a common feature in its relatives, as it was not visible in the specimen found representing K. sangabrielensis. All three Konzhukovia species exhibit oval nostrils with wide lateral openings located on the anterior edge of the snout (Pacheco, 2016). The premaxilla, maxilla, and nasal all make contact with the nostrils edges and the prefrontal is fragmented. The maxilla is what forms most of the lateral portion of the choanae, giving an overall long and oval form which is seen in all konzhukoviids and several other temnospondyls. The vomer contacts the maxilla and its lateral process reaches the same level as the palatine tucks. The cultriform process of the parasphenoid in K. vetusta and K. tarda is inserted between the vomers. These animals have interpterygoid vacuities which appear to be oval and elongated, the palatine is what forms the most anterior part of the vacuity. The pterygoids are fragmented and in K. tarda, the palatine ramus of the pterygoid runs anteriorly to the palatine tusks, unlike in K. vetusta where the palatine ramus ends at the same level. The illiac blade is known to be not bifurcated in K. vetusta.  Discovery   Konzhukovia vetusta  Konzhukovia vetusta was discovered in 1955 by E. D. Konzhukova. A K. vetusta skull was found in the Bolshekinelskaya Formation at the Malyi Uran locality, Orenburg region, in Russia. The K. vetusta skull was originally described by Gubin, in 1991, and assigned to the family of Melosauridae which later becomes renamed.  Konzhukovia tarda  Konzhukovia tarda was found in the Ocher Assemblage Zone in the Orenburg region of Russia.  Konzhukovia sangabrielensis  In 2016, Cristian Pereira Pacheco described K. sangabrielensis from the anterior half and partial right side of a skull roof and palate of a temnospondyl from South America. After diagnosis of the species by Pacheco and his group, it was clear that it was of the genus Konzhukovia which was previously recorded exclusively from Russia. The specimen of K. sangabrielensis that is described by Pachecho was recovered from Posto Queimado (Early Guadalupian), Rio do Rasto Formation, state of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Bazil. Initially, this specimen was recorded as a Melosaurinae by Dias-da-Silva (2012), but phylogenetic analysis supported its placement within Tryphosuchinae, basal to the Russian temnospondyls of this group. Once K. sangabrielensis was discovered, the new family of Konzhokoviidae was proposed in order to accommodate the new Brazilian species in relation to its Russian relatives. K. sangabrielensis remains the basal most konzhukoviid in the family.  Geological setting  The Rio do Rasto Formation, where K. sangabrielensis was recovered, ranges from Guadalupian to Lopingian. The Permian specimens that have been found in southern South America only consist of fossil faunas in the Rio do Rasto Formation. The Southern Urals area of European Russia, where K. tarda and K. vetusta were found, have been the recovery site of many amphibians and reptiles from the Upper Permian, dating back to the 1940s. The area with rich deposits consists of 900,000 km2 of land between River Volga in the northwest and Orenburg in the southwest. A continental succession consisting of mudstones, siltstones, and sandstones provides specimens from the last two stages of the Permian, the Kazanian and Tatarian.

In a long career, he was perhaps best known as the first actor to play the role of Othello in the Restoration era.Edwin Nunzeger, A Dictionary of Actors and of Other Persons Associated with the Representation of Plays in England before 1642, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1929; pp. 79-81. A \\"Nicholas Bert\\" was christened on 27 May 1621, in Norwich; the record may refer to the actor, though this is not certain. According to James Wright's Historia Histrionica (1699), Burt began as a boy player with the King's Men, an apprentice of John Shank (died 1636). He was with the celebrated young company Beeston's Boys in the 1638-42 period. As a young actor filling female roles, Burt gained particular notice for playing Clariana in Shirley's Love's Cruelty. After the theatres closed in 1642 at the start of the English Civil War, Burt, like some other actors, joined the Royalist army supporting the cause of King Charles I. Like fellow actors Charles Hart and Robert Shatterell, Burt served as an officer in the regiment of Prince Rupert in the early and mid-1640s. He most likely saw combat in the battles of Marston Moor and Naseby, and perhaps at Edgehill as well.John H. Astington, \\"Actors and the Court After 1642,\\" Early Modern Literary Studies, Special Issue 15 (August 2007), pp. 1-23. Once the Civil War had ended, Burt returned to acting and to the King's Men: he was one of the performers arrested on 5 February 1648, during an illegal performance of Rollo Duke of Normandy (he played Latorch). He was also one of the ten men who tried to restart the King's Men in December 1648, despite the parliamentarians' opposition to playacting.Judith Milhous and Robert D. Hume, \\"New Light of English Acting Companies in 1646, 1648, and 1660,\\" Review of English Studies, New Series, Vol. 42 No. 168 (November 1991), pp. 487-509. With the Restoration, Burt's professional fortunes revived. Burt took the lead role in a 1660 production of Shakespeare's Othello, the first staging of that play after the theatres re-opened; Walter Clun won fame for his portrayal of Iago in that production. Samuel Pepys was in the audience on 11 October 1660, and saw Burt's Othello again in 1669, as recorded in his Diary. (After that time, though, Burt lost the role to Hart.) In 1661 Burt became one of the thirteen actors who were original sharers in the newly organized King's Company under the management of Thomas Killigrew. He continued with the King's Company until 1678. When the troupe's theatre, the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, burned down in 1672, the funds to build its replacement had to be raised largely from the actors; Burt invested ¬£160 in the project.John Payne Collier, \\"Dryden, Killigrew, and the first company which acted at the Drury Lane Theatre,\\" The Shakespeare Society's Papers, Vol. 1, London, 1844; pp. 147-55. Beyond Othello, Burt played a range of significant roles,Nunzeger, p. 81. in revivals of works by Shakespeare, Jonson and Fletcher: * Prince Hal in Shakespeare's Henry IV plays * Cleremont in Jonson's Epicene * Corvino in Volpone * Surly in The Alchemist * Cicero in Catiline * Seleucus in Fletcher's The Humorous Lieutenant * Don John Decastrio in Rule a Wife and Have a Wife * Tygranes in A King and No King * the Elder Loveless in The Scornful Lady * Charles in The Elder Brother -- and contemporary works, by John Dryden: * Palamede in Marriage √† la mode * Perez in Amboyna * Lysimantes in The Maiden Queen * Don Lopez in An Evening's Love * Vasquez in The Indian Emperour * Camillo in The Assignation -- and by other dramatists: * Maherbal in Lee's Sophonisba, or Hannibal's Overthrow * Afterwit in Wilson's The Cheats * Count Guesselin in Boyle's The Black Prince.

The guard consisted of four companies (La Montagnarde, Saint-Just, February and Morisset). Beginning in May 1848, the Commission tried unsuccessfully to eliminate the prefecture of police. After the failure of the invasion of the National Assembly on May 15, 1848, he was dismissed from his position as prefect of police by the executive Commission. He resigned his tenure as deputy to the Constituent Assembly. In the elections of early June he was reelected but after the failure of the June Days Uprising, he was forced to flee and took refuge in England and the USA where he resumed his activities as a wine broker.

Corbach was the first battle of the campaign of 1760 and was a victory for the French over the Hanoverians, the British and their allies.  Preliminary maneuvers  The town of Corbach is sited on the heights of Corbach that rise to some 400 meters above the surrounding plain and extend about one mile east of Corbach to the woods of Berndorf, while several roads intersect at the town itself. Numerous large forces from both sides were concentrating in this area. The main French force under Victor-Fran√ßois, 2nd duc de Broglie marshal of France was about 18 miles to the south at Frankenburg while the main allied force under Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick was at Sachsenhausen 6 miles to the east. De Broglie had been ordered to advance on Hanover north through Hesse and the French at Corbach were only 25 miles west of Cassel the capital of Hesse. Corbach itself had been previously seized on 9 July by General Nicolas Luckner, the Hanoverian light cavalry commander, but his small force of 4 squadrons and a battalion of Hessian J√§gers was driven off very early on the 10th by the vanguard of St. Germain. Ferdinand sent Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand, the Hereditary Prince, the Erbprinz of Brunswick, with a mixed force of British, Hanoverians, Hessians and others with the intent to retake Corbach, defeat St. Germain's corps and prevent the junction of two French armies at that point. Leaving Lord Granby in command at Sachsenhausen, Ferdinand marched with a large force to Wildungen. The Erbprinz marched from Sachsenhausen and arrived before the heights of Corbach by 9 in the morning. The British portion under the command of Major General John Griffin of the allied force is stated to be at least four battalionsThe Manuscripts of His Grace, the Duke of Rutland, Vol. II, London 1889, p. 209, these are 4 of the \\"...six battalions-1,000 men each...\\" mentioned. Manners, Walter Evelyn, Some Account of the Military, Political, and Social Life of the Right Hon. John Manners Marquis of Granby, London, 1899, Macmillan and Company Ltd., p. 131, note 5: \\"...Carr's, Brudenell's, Hodgson's, Cornwallis' of foot; including: Hodgson's 5th, Cornwallis' 24th, Carr's 50th, Brudenell's 51st; five squadron's of horse including three of Bland's Dragoons and 2 of Howard's; and a brigade of 18 pieces of artillery under Captain Charlton. The balance of the allied force was some nineteen battalions of Hanoverian, Hessian and Brunswick foot and fourteen squadrons of cavalry. Additionally, Luckner was still in the vicinity. Saint Germain's command was, initially, the two brigades of de la Tour-du-Pin and la Couronne followed by the brigades Royal-Su√©dois and de Castella (3 Swiss regiments) reinforced later by Navarre and du RoiCharles Pierre Victor Pajol, Les guerres sous Louis XV: Tome 5, Paris 2006, , pp. 56‚Äì58 and is stated to be various sizes from a low of 10 battalions and fifteen squadrons, perhaps 7,000 to as many as 10,000 in six brigadesSavory states that there were ultimately some 36 French battalions. Some French regiments recorded to have been at the battle are La Tour-du-Pin, Bourbonnais, Auvergne, Belzunce, Du Roi, Vaubecourt, Dauphin, Aquitaine, La Couronne, Talaru and Traisnel. Some of these regiments may have consisted of more than one battalion and be the reason for the estimates of 10,000 and 6 brigades. In the French army brigades were generally named after the senior regiment. and 17 squadrons.  The battle  The Erbprinz, Charles William Ferdinand of Brunswick. Hanoverian Cavalryman The duc de Broglie St. Germain deployed four infantry battalions in the town of Corbach. The rest of his corps, infantry artillery and cavalry, were drawn up on Corbach heights extending east and somewhat north to the woods of Berndorf in which he deployed some light troops. The Hereditary Prince deployed his corps and attacked immediately, however, the French deployment obliged him to leave his left rear open to an advance by any French reinforcement sent north on the road from Frankenberg to Corbach. The battle began with the allies' arrival at 9 A.M., opening with some Hussar light cavalry skirmishing from both sides. A heated cannonade lasted throughout the day along with brisk infantry fire with the French standing firm. The fight became particularly intense in the center in a hollow way, between two woods on the hill between Corbach and Berndorf Wood where the French put the German allied contingent into some difficulty. According to an official report from Granby to Ligonier,The Manuscripts of His Grace, the Duke of Rutland, Vol. II, London 1889, p. 219 the arrival of French troops from Frankenberg on the allied rear decided the Prince on a withdrawal. During the withdrawal confusion broke out in the allied German infantry and cavalry ranksBurke, Edmund and Davis, John, The Annual Register, Or, A View of the History, Politics, and Literature for the year 1760, London 1789, p. 21 the French redoubled their artillery fire and charged with a large body of cavalry. The allied retreat began around 3 in the afternoon in some disorder. Two of British cavalry squadrons of the 1st King's Regiment of Dragoon Guards and the 2nd Queen's Regiment of Dragoon Guards led by the Erbprinz charged and are credited with saving nearly the entire force, with the 1st KDG losing 47 killed. The two British cavalry regiments and two British infantry regiments, the 50th and 51st, covered the allies' retreat but could not prevent the loss of the right flank Royal Artillery Brigade and 18 guns to the French.  Aftermath  The battle of Corbach was the first battle of the campaign of 1760. The French success at Corbach combined with De Broglie's taking the initiative early in the season did much to enable them to continue their advance and maintain the gains they made by maneuver in Germany despite several subsequent battlefield defeats at the hands of the Hereditary Prince and Ferdinand in the battles of Emsdorf and Warburg. With the French marginal victory at the Kloster Kampen later in October any hope the British had of ending the war on favorable terms in 1760 evaporated despite their successes in America.Dull, Jonathan.

Beall, \\"Un Recueil italianisant du XVIIIe si√®cle fran√ßais\\", Modern Language Notes, 55:7 (Nov., 1940), 531. She is now considered legendary by most scholars.Karin Pendle, Women and Music: A History (Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 2001), 35. Adolfo Borgognoni first proposed that Nina was a fictional construct of male poets in 1891 and was soon followed by Giulio Bertoni.A Borgognoni, \\"La condanna capitale di una bella signora\\", Studi di letteratura storica (Bologna, 1891); G. Bertoni, Il Duecento (Milan: 1910), 78. Specifically Borgognoni thought she was invented by the successors of printer Filippo Giunti: essa [Nina] nacque in Firenze, nella officina degli Eredi di Filippo Giunti, l'anno del Signore 1527 (\\"this one [Nina] was born in Florence, in the office of the heirs of Filippo Giunti, the year of the Lord 1527\\").Paolo Malpezzi Price, \\"Uncovering Women's Writings: Two Early Italian Women Poets\\" , Journal of the Rocky Mountain Medieval and Renaissance Association, 9 (1988), 3. The historicity of Nina--and tangentially the sex of the author of the poem traditionally assigned to her--has been debated ever since.Once upon a time her birthplace--Palermo or Messina--was debated. Liborio Azzolina tried to resuscitate her and also Compiuta Donzella, whom Borgognoni, with less supporters, also ascribed to later male poets' imaginations.L. Azzolina, La compiuta donzella di Firenze (Palermo: Lo Casto, 1902).

It lived in the middle Permian, about 260 million years ago. Its remains were found in Germany.Berman, D. Berman, D. S, Henrici, AC, Kissel, R., Sumida, SS, and Martens, T. S, Henrici, AC, Kissel, R., Sumida, SS, and Martens, T. (2004): A new diadectid (Diadectomorpha), Orobates pabsti, from the Early Permian of Central Germany. Bulletin of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History No 35: pp 1-37. abstract A combination of primitive and derived traits (i.e. autapomorphic and plesiomorphic) distinguish it from all other well-known members of the Diadectidae, a family of herbivorous reptile-like amphibians. It weighed about 4 kg and appears to have been part of an upland fauna, browsing on high fibre plants. Restoration  Locomotion  Humboldt University: red parts are reconstructed from the fossil, blue parts are mirrors of the red parts, and yellow parts are estimations. The trace fossil species Ichniotherium sphaerodactylum, from Bromacker in Germany, has been attributed to Orobates. A study in 2015 found that the genus was characterized by a long body and tail, with fairly short legs and a short skull compared to the more derived Diadectes. This indicates Orobates was less specialised for long treks compared to Diadectes. A three-dimensional digital reconstruction of the holotype specimen allowed further analysis of the postcranium. An analysis of the mobility of the hip joint of the reconstructed holotype indicated that its limb function was similar to that of modern salamanders. A detailed multidisciplinary study published in 2019 found that Orobates moved more like modern caimans than salamanders. The study began with the digitization of its holotype specimen using CT scanning to figure out the range of motion of its joints. A digital model of its fossil trackways helped narrow down the possibilities. The researchers also studied the locomotion of four extant sprawling tetrapods using X-ray motion analysis. The extant tetrapods chosen for the study were axolotls, blue-tongued skinks, green iguanas, and spectacled caimans. The biomechanical data of the locomotion of the extant tetrapods and the digital models of Orobates' holotype and fossilized trackways were then used to create a dynamic simulation. It allowed the researchers to account for physical factors like gravity, friction, and balance. The simulation was then validated under real-world conditions with a life-sized robot called OroBOT. The researchers tested 512 different gaits and found that Orobates moved most like a caiman. It had a relatively erect posture and walked with a slight side-to-side motion.

In 1911, a largely intact skeleton was found in the same area. The vertebrae agreed with the described type species and the new find was considered likely to be the same species. The total length of the animal when restored was 1.35 metres. The skull measured 16.7 centimetres. It was in poor condition but was similar to that of Diadectes lenius and Animasatirus carinatus. The nares and orbits were in similar positions and there were fourteen teeth with possibly a rudimentary fifteenth, a dentition typical of the family. The vertebrae, ribs and limbs were described in detail. The carpals were mostly present and still in position - the best preserved examples for a diadectid then found. The foot was broad and strong with short phalanges. The feet and limbs supported the view that this animal was a marsh-dweller and probably a slow-moving herbivore.

The prototype is chambered in 9√ó19mm Parabellum but the manufacturer assures that the weapon's modular design allows for a simple caliber conversion to either 5.7√ó28mm or 4.6√ó30mm. Design details The CPW is a modular selective fire lever-delayed blowback operated weapon (using what STK calls a cam recoil mitigation mechanism), which contributes to the low felt recoil and allows for use with high pressure ammunition. The weapon has a conventional submachine gun layout with the magazine housed in the pistol grip. The pistol grip's backstrap and the 30-round magazine are molded from a translucent plastic which allows the shooter to quickly verify the remaining level of ammunition visually. The receiver is machined from a lightweight aluminum alloy and most of the other components are made of a high-strength polymer to further reduce weight and costs. The barrel and bolt assembly can be quickly replaced, converting the submachine gun to the small-caliber armor-piercing PDW ammunition. The CPW is fully ambidextrous. Every lever, control or toggle has been mirrored on the opposite side of the receiver ‚Äì this includes the cocking handle, the fire control selector/manual safety switch (installed above the pistol grip) as well as the bolt release lever, which is used to slam the bolt closed after inserting a new magazine. The ejection port is located on the right side of the weapon. The CPW has a collapsible metal stock that provides stability during aimed fire. When collapsed, the weapon is not much larger than a conventional pistol, allowing for easy handling and concealment; the CPW can be carried in a holster. Two Picatinny rails are provided in the CPW for mounting sights and tactical accessories ‚Äì one continuous rail runs across the top of the receiver and a second shorter accessory rail is installed under the barrel, in front of the trigger guard. The top rail can accommodate conventional iron sights or optoelectronic sighting devices such as reflex sights. The bottom rail is intended primarily for laser aiming modules, vertical grips and flashlights.

It is a real-time monitoring of the concentrations of several pollutants in the atmosphere of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area. It was established for the inhabitants of Mexico City and the Greater Mexico City area to know the real-time levels of air pollution in their urban environment. Calculation process The IMECA is calculated using the measurements of the quality of the air by SIMAT (Sistema de Monitoreo Atmosf√©rico de la Ciudad de M√©xico). The IMECA is used to show the level of pollution and the level of risk that represents to the human health in the greater Mexico City and also the time of the measurements or the actions recommended for protection. The IMECA is calculated using the measurements of average times of the chemicals ozone (O3), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and particles lower than 10 micrometers (PM10). The IMECA is published each hour for the population of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area, which includes the municipalities of Mexico City and of the State of M√©xico. Categories To report the quality of the air, the IMECA uses 5 index categories: *Buena (good) ‚Äî when the index is between 0 and 50 imecas. The quality of air is considered satisfactory and the air pollution poses minimal or no health risks. *Regular (regular) ‚Äî when the index is between 51 and 100 imecas. The quality of air is acceptable, however some contaminants could have moderate health effects for a small fraction of the population that has high sensitivity to some contaminants. *Mala (bad) ‚Äî when the index is between 101 and 150. In this value, some sensitive groups can have health effects. Some people can experience minor symptoms, including people with breathing or heart problems, children and old people. At this stage, there is no significant risk for the general public. *Muy mala (very bad) ‚Äî when the index is between 151 and 200. In this situation everybody can experience negative health effects.

Considered a \\"maverick publishing genius\\",George Greenfield, Scribblers for Bread: A history of the pulp publishing world in England since 1945, Hodder & Stoughton, 1989. he was noted for his phenomenal drive and energy, his innovative business ideas and also for his prolific output as an author.  Early life  Born in 1913 in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, Gordon Landsborough left school at 14 to help support his family. In the evenings he went to night classes, eventually becoming a chemist with the research department of ICI. Continuing his studies, he turned to journalism and worked on a number of papers and journals in the north of England. In 1938, he started up ARP News, a magazine promoting air raid precautions to a war-nervous England. He moved to London in 1939, where, among other business ventures, in 1940 he started Reveille, which was originally the official newspaper of the Ex-Services' Allied Association. In 1940 he joined up with the London Scottish Regiment, serving for a time in the deserts of North Africa. His experiences there provide the material for several of his best selling novels.  Post Second World War book publishing and writing  In 1949, Landsborough was hired by publishers Hamilton & Co as production editor for their entire range of books. As part of his contract with Hamilton, he negotiated a deal with them to buy one novel a month from him.Vultures of the Void: A History Of British Science Fiction Publishing, 1946‚Äì56, Philip Harbottle and Stephen Holland, Borgo, US, 1992 He soon made sweeping changes to their lists of science fiction, crime, and romance and expanded them to include foreign legion. By the start of 1951, Hamilton‚Äôs science fiction titles were being published every two weeks and eventually evolved into the science fiction magazine, Authentic Science Fiction. With Landsborough as its first editor, it ran for 85 issues. Landsborough left Hamilton in mid-1951 to pursue his own career as a writer and publisher. His publishing expertise was much sought after, and he was employed as an advisor to three companies in the paperback publishing industry during the next few years. His next business venture, in 1953, was an innovation for British publishing: Weekend Novels. Published every Wednesday, they contained a complete and unabridged best selling novel in a 24-page newspaper format with some advertising and were sold for sixpence through newsagents.World‚Äôs Press News, 8 May and 15 May 1953 and Huddersfield Examiner, 27 May 1953 In these: \\"He bought reprint rights in existing printed novels and published them each week in tabloid newspaper format without any form of binding or stapling and with line drawings as illustrations... His venture was under-capitalised and had to close after some twenty or so issues had appeared.\\" In 1954, after Weekend Novels closed, Landsborough returned to Hamilton‚Äôs as editor of their Panther Books imprint, which would go on to become one of the leading British paperback publishing houses. In 1957, Landsborough left Panther Books to start up Four Square Books, backed by the tobacco company Godfrey Phillips.Gordon Landsborough, The Grab: A Classic Crime Novel: Heggy Investigates, Book One, Borgo Press, 2012, p. 72. Michael Geare, who was employed by him in 1957 as sales manager, said of him: \\"He was a gifted, clever, likeable chap, and really knew everything about book publishing. On one occasion when we were a book short on the list, he took five days off and wrote the book himself ‚Äì 'Return Via Benghazi' or something. It wasn't half a bad paperback, either.\\"National Life Stories: Book Trade Lives, The British Library sound archives (oral history); to be published as The British Book Trade: an Oral History, British Library Publications, October 2008 Landsborough left Four Square Books in the late 1950s to establish, in late 1960, Mayfair Books and also one of England‚Äôs first children's paperback companies, Armada Books. The Armada Books list included, somewhat controversially, Enid Blyton, whose books at that time were frowned on by libraries and academics but still sold in their hundreds of thousands. The list also included W. E. John's immensely popular Biggles series and stories he wrote for children based on the popular television series Bonanza. Armada Books was sold to Collins Books in 1963. In the early 1960s Landsborough, together with two film-producers, set up a film company to produce a film version of Werfel's novel The Forty Days of Musa Dagh. An edition of this book had already been published by Mayfair Books, and he approached Werfel's widow for the film rights. The project advanced to the stage of Landsborough writing a film treatment, and it being bought by an Italian film studio, before it was discovered that Metro Goldwyn-Mayer had acquired the film rights in 1932 and still held them.\\"Gordon Landsborough ‚Äì The Forty Days of Musa Dagh\\", in Aregak Armenian Monthly, April 1965, pp. 76‚Äì77. In 1965 he started up another children's publishing company, Dragon Books. His list included his own abridgements for children of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan books and P. C. Wren's Beau Geste. Dragon Books was later acquired by Granada Publishing Ltd. In 1950, initially as part of his contract with Hamilton's, Landsborough started writing novels, prolifically producing around 90 books over the next 35 years.To date he has been established as the author of 70 books written under his own name and under pseudonyms. However, as was a common practice at this time, he wrote many novels under publishing company \\"house names\\" and it is likely that many of these remain unaccounted for. Given that he was quoted as having produced 51 novels up to 1953, the total number of books written by him is therefore thought to have been around 90 titles. In 1953 he told newspapers that in a period of just three years from 1950 to 1953 he wrote 51 novels (at least 49 of which were accepted) at a rate of a million words a year. Like many well-known authors during those economically tough post war years, he wrote genre novels under pseudonyms for the rapidly growing paperback market, to augment his income. Most of these were westerns and crime novels, \\"mass produced\\" using a tape recorder at a rate of about one a month. He wrote 13 books under his own name, including, in 1956, the best selling Tobruk Commando. Also in 1956 were published The Battle of the River Plate (with sales revenue going to the survivors' fund), the book of the film Storm Center, starring Bette Davis, and the book of the film The Bold and the Brave, starring Mickey Rooney. In the 1970s he continued to write, producing another five books including the popular Glasshouse Gang series. A short story, Something in the Air, one of two commissioned in 1970 by Philip Harbottle, editor of the short-lived science fiction magazine, Vision of Tomorrow, was published in Fantasy Adventures No 4, edited by Philip Harbottle.Fantasy Adventures No 4, edited by Philip Harbottle, Cosmos Books, 2003 A number of his early books, originally written under pseudonyms, have been republished since 2003, some now under his own name, in both hard copy and as ebooks. In 2015, a book, In Search of Burke & Wills: The Story of William Landsborough, Queensland's Forgotten Explorer that Gordon researched and wrote the first draft of in 1972 when he was living in Australia, about a distant relative, explorer William Landsborough was edited and published by his family.  Magazine publishing and remainder bookselling in the 1970s and 1980s  In 1971‚Äì73 he worked on freelance publishing ventures involving tourism and travel in Hong Kong and Australia, including the establishment of LookEast magazine.

The NASA Mini-Sniffers were a series of unmanned aerial vehicles designed to sample the air at high altitude to support various scientific studies.Goebel, Greg, \\"The NASA ERAST HALE UAV Program\\", Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, chapter 15. Exists in the public domain. History In the early 1970s, NASA engineer Dale Reed was investigating methods for sampling the atmosphere at very high altitudes, up to 21 kilometers (70,000 feet). NASA's studies into supersonic transport jets had led to questions about their possible impact on the upper atmosphere, and Reed designed a series of \\"Mini- Sniffer\\" drones to take air samples at high altitudes. NASA also considered them for planetary atmospheric sampling flights over Mars. Three Mini-Sniffers were built by NASA Dryden Flight Research Center and were flown from 1975 through 1982. The aircraft Mini-Sniffer I The initial \\"Mini-Sniffer I\\" had a wingspan of 5.5 meters (18 feet), tailfins on the wingtips, and canards on the nose. It used a gasoline-powered piston engine and performed a dozen low-altitude flights to validate the design. Mini-Sniffer II Mini- Sniffer II. The Mini-Sniffer I was then modified into the \\"Mini-Sniffer II\\" by removing the canards and the wingtip tailfins, then adding tail booms and extending the wings, giving it a wingspan of 6.7 meters (22 feet). It was still powered by a gasoline engine, and made 21 flights to a maximum altitude of 6,100 meters (20,000 feet). To get to much higher altitudes, Reed planned to use an unusual engine that burned hydrazine. A normal internal combustion engine burns gasoline with air to generate power, but at 21 kilometers the air is too thin to keep it running. Instead of gasoline, Reed planned to use hydrazine, or (NH2)2, which breaks down spontaneously when run across a catalyst, generating heat to produce steam to drive the engine. Hydrazine is a corrosive, toxic, and unstable propellant, but its ability to \\"burn\\" without oxygen makes it useful for spacecraft thrusters and for such high-altitude engine applications. Mini-Sniffer III \\"Mini-Sniffer III\\" was a new build aircraft, similar to Mini-Sniffer II but with a longer fuselage and the hydrazine engine. It was designed to carry an 11.3 kilogram (25 pound) payload to 70,000 feet or higher. However, the Mini-Sniffer III only made a single flight to 6,100 meters (20,000 feet), and was not flown again because fuel leaks made it hazardous to handle. NASA lost interest in the idea, and the concept of a high-altitude UAV was abandoned until later when the NASA ERAST Program resurrected the idea.

Their sound draws on several musical genres, including pop, indie rock, melodic rock, and alternative to which the band refers to as melody-driven, British influenced pop-rock. Since forming in Baraboo, Wisconsin, We the Living was last based in Nashville. History End of The Profits, Beginning of We the Living We the Living began in April 2007 in Madison, Wisconsin as a project of singer John Paul Roney and drummer Benjamin Schaefer after their band, The Profits, which was renowned within the Wisconsin college music scene, disbanded. Soon after recruiting guitarist Matthew Holmen and bassist Stefan Benkowski, We the Living began to play the same venue circuits that The Profits had formerly commanded. However, the music had a very different, more grown-up sound and pulled from new influences such as Coldplay, Mutemath, Radiohead, The Fray, John Mayer, and others of similar genres. Heights of the Heavens (2007-2008) The band was first signed to Authentik Artists, a label with a focus on digital marketing and distribution, founded by former Warner/Capitol/Maverick A&R; Scott Austin and Legendary Pictures founder Scott Mednick. Under Austin's management the band began work on their debut full- length CD. We the Living's first album Heights of the Heavens was originally released on April 17, 2007. The record was mixed by Mark Needham (Fleetwood Mac, The Killers, Metro Station)and engineered by Shaun Lopez of Far. It received much acclaim for its lyrically deft yet soulful sound and allowed the band to headline 180 acts during the 2007 year. These performances also included performing with Angels and Airwaves, Gym Class Heroes, Dashboard Confessional, Katy Perry, Anberlin, Ludo, We The Kings, Relient K, Jack's Mannequin, Say Anything, Hellogoodbye, Circa Survive, The Academy Is‚Ä¶, The Roots, Blessid Union of Souls, Sherwood, Motion City Soundtrack, and The Color Fred. During this time the band also headlined major musical festivals around the Midwest. In 2008 the band re-released a remastered copy of Heights of the Heavens. The new copy also came in different packaging, which they used to launch the concept of Philo, or each person's own life philosophy, and which reflected the significance this subject has had on the band's success, fans, as well as personal lives. Depths of the Earth (2008) After touring in support of Heights of the Heavens and fulfilling its contract with Authentik Artists, the band returned to the studio to independently record five songs that weren't ready in time for the wrapping of the first record. Taking the name from the second half of a Sun Tzu quote that Heights of the Heavens was obtained from, the band completed and mixed Depths of the Earth at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin with Beau Sorensen (Death Cab for Cutie, Tegan and Sara). Reviews, airplay, and new projects On March 25, 2008 We the Living's song ‚ÄúBest Laid Plans‚Äù was featured on celebrity blog run by Perez Hilton featured as a band to love. In the blog Perez stated that with the quality of the melody and piano it should be the theme song to the new Beverly Hills, 90210 spin-off. After this posting, the band's music began to reach the ears of many who were not in their touring circuit, which allowed the band to become a featured artist on tastemaker sites such as Purevolume, Myspace, AOL Music, Clear Channel, iMeem, and BeBo. Receiving constant positive reviews from newspapers and other publications such as the arts section of the national satirical syndicate, The Onion and AP Magazine the band's airplay soared. In the fall of 2008, We the Living's \\"Best Laid Plans\\" was selected by Levi's brand clothing to be a part of their nationwide Unbuttoned ad campaign. The band has earned spins on over 200 A/C and college radio station as well as prominent placement on MTV, VH1, E!, G4, Oxygen, Discovery, and MTV2.

Held at New York City's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on the third Thursday of October, it is hosted by the Archbishop of New York while organized by the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation in honor of Al Smith who grew up in poverty and later became the Governor of New York four times and the first Catholic nominated as the Democratic candidate for the 1928 United States presidential election. Cardinal Francis Spellman founded and hosted the first dinner in 1945 after Smith's death the previous year. By 1960 the Al Smith dinner had become a \\"ritual of American politics\\", in the words of Theodore H. White. It is generally the last event at which the two U.S. presidential candidates share a stage before the election. Apart from presidential candidates, keynote speakers have included Tony Blair, 7-minute excerpt from the second British Prime Minister to address the Al Smith Foundation dinner.

Trump deliver remarks at the Al Smith charity dinner at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan. and in 2020, Trump and Joe Biden. Since 1945, only two presidents have not spoken at the dinner: Harry Truman and Bill Clinton. Candidates have traditionally given humorous speeches poking fun at themselves and their opponents, making the event similar to a roast. The 2018 dinner raised $3.9 million. Since 1980, this custom has been affected by friction between the Democratic Party and the Catholic Church over abortion. During the 1980 dinner, Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter was booed. In 1984, Ronald Reagan spoke, but his opponent, Walter Mondale, opted out, saying he needed time to prepare for an upcoming presidential debate. Amy Sullivan suggests that Mondale's decision was motivated by \\"tensions between the Catholic Church and the Democratic Party.\\" President Barack Obama preparing for the 2012 Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. In 1996 and 2004, the Archdiocese of New York chose not to invite the presidential candidates. In 1996, this was reportedly because Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor was angry at Democratic nominee Bill Clinton for vetoing a bill outlawing some late-term abortions. The organizers' explanation was that the candidates had been unable to commit to attending the dinner. The vice-presidential candidates spoke instead. In 2004, Archdiocese spokesman Joseph Zwilling explained that the candidates were not invited because \\"the issues in this year's campaign could provoke division and disagreement,\\" but some speculated that the decision was due to Democratic nominee (and Roman Catholic) John Kerry's pro-choice stance on abortion. On October 20, 2016, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump spoke at the dinner which was hosted by Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan who was seated between the two presidential candidates during the event. During the dinner, Trump made numerous remarks about Hillary Clinton, including references to the hacking of the email server of the Democratic National Committee, her supposed corruption, and her back room dealings with Wall Street elites. The 2016 dinner drew 10.3 million viewers and raised a record-breaking $6 million for Catholic charities. The 2020 dinner occurred in a virtual format, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, and the traditional roast-like nature was abandoned; still, it was attended by Joe Biden and Donald Trump; both men discussed Catholicism. In media During the 2000 dinner, George W. Bush joked, \\"This is an impressive crowd. The haves and the have-mores. Some people call you the elite. I call you my base.\\" The quote was used in Fahrenheit 9/11 and subsequently in one of John Kerry's 2004 campaign speeches.

He entered politics as a Democrat and supporter of Andrew Jackson. Early life and education Hamilton was born on April 14, 1788, the fourth child of American founding father Alexander Hamilton and Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton. Hamilton later wrote of his childhood: > [Alexander] Hamilton's gentle nature rendered his house a joyous one to his > children ... His intercourse with his children was always affectionate and > confiding, which excited in them a corresponding confidence and devotion. I > distinctly recollect the scene at breakfast in the front room of the house > in Broadway. My dear mother, seated as was her wont at the head of the table > with a napkin in her lap, cutting slices of bread and spreading them with > butter for the younger boys ... When the lessons were finished the father > and the elder children were called to breakfast, after which the boys were > packed off to school. When James was sixteen, his father was killed in a duel with Vice President Aaron Burr. Along with his mother and siblings, James was present in the room, sitting at his father's bedside, when he died a few hours after the duel. Hamilton graduated from Columbia University in 1805 at the age of seventeen. He later studied law, and in 1809, he was admitted to the bar, and practiced law for a year in Waterford, New York. Career In 1810, Hamilton moved to Hudson, New York, and practiced law there for several years. During the War of 1812, Hamilton served as a Brigade Major and Inspector in the New York State Militia. In March 1829, Hamilton served as acting Secretary of State to President Andrew Jackson, surrendering the office on the regular appointment of Martin Van Buren. That same year he was appointed U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Curiously, he sided with Jackson in opposing the Second Bank of the United States, the successor to the bank which had originally been invented by his father. In an 1830 letter to Jackson, Hamilton proposed that a substitute be created for the Bank, and articulated several supposed deficiencies with the present Bank. His arguments made against the institution were quite similar to those of Jackson. He claimed that the Bank was subversive to liberty and that it exerted unfair influence on the election process. The stock, he claimed, was owned mostly by foreigners, and thus the Bank could be controlled by forces hostile to the United States. Hamilton declared that the very institution was unconstitutional because Congress did not have the power to create it. In 1867, he published a book of memoirs. In the book's preface, he writes that he was \\"induced to undertake this work by a desire to do justice\\" to his father \\"against the aspersions of Mr. Jefferson, and more recently of Martin Van Buren.\\" His father's life and career, friends and rivals, are discussed at length in Hamilton's memoirs. Personal life On October 17, 1810, Hamilton married Mary Morris (1790‚Äì1869), the daughter of Robert Morris (1762‚Äì1851) and Frances Ludlam (1766‚Äì1852). Mary was the older sister of Lewis Gouverneur Morris (1808‚Äì1900), the granddaughter of Richard Morris (1730‚Äì1810), Chief Justice of the New York Supreme Court, the great- granddaughter of Lewis Morris, an early colonial governor of New Jersey, and the grandniece of Lewis Morris (1726‚Äì1798), a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Hamilton later recalled their first years of marriage: > Both I and my wife were without means ‚Äì our parents not being in a situation > to do much for us. This I have always considered the most fortunate event of > my life. I realized the embarrassments of my situation, and met them with > the determination to overcome them. Nor did my resolution fail of its > reward. Our self-denials were great, indeed, but our faith in the future was > greater ... Our poverty was so extreme that during our first year we boarded > at four dollars per week for each. I now look back upon this event as not > only the happiest, but the most fortunate occurrence of my long and eventful > life. My poverty, with its burdens and responsibilities, nerved me to > exertion, and necessity taught me the value of economy and self-denial. Together, Hamilton and his wife had five children: * Elizabeth \\"Eliza\\" Hamilton (1811‚Äì1863), who married George Lee Schuyler (1811‚Äì1890), the son of Philip Jeremiah Schuyler. * Frances \\"Fanny\\" Hamilton (1813‚Äì1887), who married George Russel James Bowdoin (1809‚Äì1870). * Alexander Hamilton Jr. (1816‚Äì1889), who married Angelica Livingston (1820‚Äì1896), the daughter of Maturin Livingston. * Mary Morris Hamilton (1818‚Äì1877), who married George Lee Schuyler (1811‚Äì1890). * Angelica Hamilton (1819‚Äì1868), who married Richard Milford Blatchford (1798‚Äì1875).

Lykins applied himself diligently to his calling, and by 1824 could read religious discourses in the Potawatomi language.Kansas Heritage He continued in Michigan until 1831, and in 1828 he married Delilah McCoy, Isaac's daughter. The Indian Removal Act of 1831, which Lykins and McCoy had been essentially advocates of, resulted in many of the mission's constituents moving westward, and in 1831 Lykins went with them, founding a mission in Missouri near the Shawnee reservation. This first move was a prelude to the later 1838 removals, known as the Potawatomi Trail of Death. The Baptist mission board approved funds for printing religious tracts in native-American languages, so in 1833 Jotham Meeker brought the first printing press to the Shawnee Mission. Books in Shawnee, Potawatomi and other native languages were rapidly produced, to be used in missionary educational programs. Lykins was actively involved and edited the Sinwiowe Kesibwi (Shawnee Sun), a small newspaper published entirely in Shawnee. In 1843 Lykins founded a mission among the Potawatomi near Topeka, Kansas.The restored mission, which was improved and expanded in later years, presently is used as a museum. In that same year, some of the tribal elders requested that he be named their tribal physician, a government post that provided him with a salary that was necessary to support the mission. His appointment was opposed by the Jesuits and the Potawatomi allied with them, but was granted in 1844. However, in that area quarrels abounded between clergy of the different Christian religions and even clerics of the same faith. Lykins was an enthusiastic participant in these, and made many enemies. This, compounded by their criticism of his lack of medical credentials, led to his dismissal from the government post (Physician to the Potawatomi) in 1851. In 1848 Lykins began a trade school at the mission, and after three years he had 90 students. Lykins left the Potawatomi mission soon after losing his medical position, returning to the Shawnee mission until 1855, when it was closed. At that time he moved to Kansas City, to be near his son. Kansas City activity In 1831 Lykins purchased in what would become the initial plat for Kansas City (his property extended south from the Missouri River to Fifth and Broadway). He later expanded his holdings to 12th and Pennsylvania on Quality Hill. While residing in Kansas City, Lykins functioned as a medical doctor, apparently self-taught.Lykins had no formal training, but medical training was often casual in those days. Faced by the desperate need of his Native American students and their families, who were succumbing to one disease after another, he read and did what he could. He already had achieved a reputation as an effective physician when he first went to Missouri. There he was confronted by a smallpox epidemic on the Shawnee reservation and began a vaccination program, an unusual approach in those days. He was also named president of Mechanics Bank. He married again in 1851. His second wife was Martha A. Livingston, who wrote a manuscript entitled \\"Recollections of Early Times in Kansas City\\" which is now in the collection of the Jackson County Historical Society. Kansas City after being incorporated in 1853 first elected William Samuel Gregory. Gregory served only 10 months when it was discovered that he was not eligible to be mayor because he did not live within the city limits. Lykins who was first president of the city council became mayor. After completing two months of Gregory's term he was elected to another one-year term.A Condensed History of the Kansas City Area: Its Mayors and Some V.I.P.s - Author: Green, George Fuller Publisher: The Lowell Press. 1968, Kansas City, MO During the American Civil War he maintained loyal Union ties while his new wife had to move to Clay County, Missouri as a result of General Order No. 11 which required loyalty oaths for those living near the Kansas border south of the Missouri River.

During the early stages of the Korean War, he commanded the 2nd Infantry Division.  Early life  Laurence Bolton Keiser was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on June 1, 1895. He graduated from West Point in 1917, in the same class as J. Lawton Collins, Matthew B. Ridgway, and Mark W. Clark. Military career Dispatched to France with the American Expeditionary Force during World War I, Keiser was quickly promoted to temporary captain and appointed to command of 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment, a unit of the 5th Division. He was awarded the Silver Star for actions on the Western Front. Interwar period Keiser was stationed with the 15th Infantry Regiment in Tientsin, China from March 1920 to June 1922. In 1923 he graduated from the Infantry Company Officers‚Äô Course at Fort Benning. He then served as a battalion commander in the 23rd Infantry Regiment at Fort Sam Houston. From 1924 to 1928, Keiser was an instructor at West Point. After his assignment at West Point, Keiser returned to Fort Sam Houston as the commander of a company in the 9th Infantry. In 1932 he completed the Infantry Officer Advanced Course at Fort Benning, after which he returned to Fort Sam Houston as advisor and mentor to units of the Army Reserve. In 1939 Keiser graduated from the United States Army Command and General Staff College, after which he was assigned to Fort Benning as executive officer and then commander of the 29th Infantry Regiment. World War II In April 1942, Keiser was assigned as chief of staff of III Corps at Fort McPherson. He then served as VI Corps chief of staff during the North African and Italian Campaigns. In January 1944, he was promoted to brigadier general and assigned as chief of staff of the Fourth Army at Fort Sam Houston. He returned to China in 1948, this time as part of the United States Military Advisory Group to the Nationalist Chinese Government. Korea In November 1948, Keiser was made assistant division commander of the 2nd Infantry Division. In February 1950, his former West Point classmate Joe Collins gave him command of the division, together with a promotion to major general. Following the outbreak of the Korean War, the 2nd Division was the first United States army unit to arrive in Korea from the mainland United States. From August to September, the division disembarked at Pusan and moved to the Naktong Bulge to assist the 24th Infantry Division, which was then struggling to restore its front line following the crossing of the Naktong River by the North Korean 4th Division. When the North Koreans launched the Great Naktong Offensive, four divisions faced the 2nd. Some units of the 2nd Infantry Division did not perform well on first contact with the enemy, and Keiser displayed lack of knowledge of his division's situation when he was confronted by Lieutenant General Walton Walker, the commander of the Eighth Army. Keiser was already considered by some officers to be slightly too old for an outstanding division commander. The 2nd Division was involved in the breakout from the Pusan Perimeter, pushing north west towards Kunsan, together with the 25th Infantry Division. The division would advance well into North Korea, close to the China‚ÄìNorth Korea border. In late November 1950, a large Chinese force crossed over the Yalu River and launched a surprise attack on the United Nations forces in what was to be known as the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River. The 2nd Division had been advancing on the right flank of IX Corps, which was then pushing to the Yalu River, and was positioned north of Kunu-ri, with the 25th Infantry Division on its left flank. In a swift week-long attack, the Chinese threatened to envelop the Eighth Army, with the 2nd Division exposed on the right and bearing the brunt of the enveloping movement. The 25th Division was able to withdraw to Anju, but Keiser was unable to obtain permission from Major General John B. Coulter to follow. The 2nd Division was eventually cut off and forced to fight its way through the Chinese to safety at Sunchon. Following the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River, during which 2nd Division suffered crippling losses of approximately 4,000 men, Keiser met with Major General Leven C. Allen, the chief of staff of the Eighth Army, in Seoul. He was relieved of his command and replaced with Major General Robert B. McClure, supposedly for medical reasons, although he felt he was being made a scapegoat for the reverses suffered by the United Nations following the Chinese intervention in the war. Later life Returning to the United States in February, 1951, he assumed command of the 5th Infantry Division at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation (IGMR) an infantry basic training camp in Pennsylvania near Hershey and Harrisburg. He retired in 1953, and settled in San Francisco. On October 20, 1969, Keiser died in San Francisco.

It is Zhang's first true documentary film, after two documentary-influenced fiction films: Mama and Beijing Bastards.Berry, Michael (2002). \\"Wording up a Sweat in a Celluloid Sauna\\" in Speaking in Images: Interviews with Contemporary Chinese Filmmakers. Columbia University Press, p. 147-48. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 2008-09-05. Filmed in black and white, The Square documents a day in the life of Tiananmen Square a few years after the events of 1989.  Subject  The film documents a day in the life of Tiananmen Square in 1994, a mere five years after the crushing of a student-led democracy movement in 1989. The events captured are considered \\"mundane\\" but illustrate the level of control exerted over the Square by the authoritarian government. While children play with kites and old men toss frisbees, police and soldiers are also ever- present. Near the end of the film, PLA soldiers array cannons in preparation for a salute to a visiting head of state. As the guns are fired, Zhang focuses his camera on the reactions of the ordinary citizens. For one critic, the film \\"seem to suggest the ceaseless and draining effort the government must expend to maintain its awesome facade of monolithic power over its citizens.\\" (republished by the University of California Berkeley library)  Production history  The concept of a documentary film about Tiananmen Square shortly after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 began while Zhang Yuan was still a student at the Beijing Film Academy, and while he was producing and filming his debut, Mama, in the late 1980s. After the protests were crushed, Zhang had opportunities to ride his bicycle around the Square from his apartment in the nearby Xidan neighborhood, noting both the quietness in the years following 1989 and the surplus of both uniformed and plainclothes policemen. In an interview given several years later, Zhang noted that he saw Tiananmen Square as \\"one giant stage\\" which pushed him to \\"pick up my camera and record some of those more interesting people and attempt to capture the feeling of the square.\\"Berry, p. 148 When he finally followed through on his plan, police would often come up and question his purpose, to which he would reply that he was part of a CCTV film crew. Zhang filmed the most \\"mundane\\" things for a period of twenty-four hours, in the process capturing both ceremony (the flag raising and lowering carried out every day by PLA soldiers) and every-day moments.Tasker, Yvonne (2002). \\"Zhang Yuan\\" in Fifty Contemporary Filmmakers. Routledge Publishing, p.421. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 2008-09-05. Indeed, the film is devoid of any dialogue, music, or narration outside of incidental moments captured by the \\"CCTV\\" camera. The film itself was made in defiance of government disapproval, as Zhang had recently been blacklisted by the government for his submission of films to international film festivals without permission. Despite this impediment, Zhang's documentary would be screened at the Hawaii International Film Festival, where it would win a Jury Prize.

The author of several books on the flora and landscape of the Pacific Northwest, Lyons is best known for his popular and widely cited botanical field guides. Lyons grew up in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia and in 1938 became a forestry engineer at a time when the Parks Branch was part of the B.C. Forest Service. Lyons designed many trails, campgrounds and picnic sites for the early provincial parks. In 1940, six months after Wells Gray Provincial Park was created, he was assigned by the Minister of Lands, Arthur Wellesley Gray, to explore and map the area. The park boundaries had been arbitrarily drawn around the drainage basin of the Clearwater River and few people knew what had been included in this huge new park. His four-month expedition produced the first maps of the new Park and he established about a quarter of its current place names, all carefully researched to remember settlers, prospectors, explorers, forest rangers, and other people who had lived and worked in the Clearwater Valley.Neave, Roland (2015). Exploring Wells Gray Park, 6th edition. Wells Gray Tours, Kamloops, BC. . After his Wells Gray Park survey, Lyons headed similar exploratory expeditions into Tweedsmuir and Manning Provincial Parks. In the 1950s, Lyons visited Liard River Hot Springs, then known as Theresa Hot Springs, in his homemade caravan and conducted a survey of potential park boundaries. He returned to Victoria and recommended that the Hot Springs be made in to a provincial park; this occurred in 1957. Lyons was also responsible for negotiations with land owners to secure the original Barkerville historic site and he acquired many artifacts that have brought realism to this popular heritage site. He was part of the crew that prepared the historic town for its opening on July 1, 2020. Lyons persuaded the Summerland Agricultural Research Station to part with some federal land along Okanagan Lake which became the popular parks of Sun-Oka Beach, Pyramid, Kickininee, and Soorimpt. British Columbia travellers in the 1960s and 1970s remember the \\"Garbage Gobblers\\" at many viewpoints; Lyons designed these concrete green and yellow figures with big white teeth and a sign \\"Please Feed Me\\". He also planned the numerous Stop of Interest signs which were 50-word snippets of information along the province's highways. Starting in the late 1960s, Lyons became a well-known outdoors photographer with frequent appearances on the CBC nature show, Klahanie. As a film lecturer for the National Audubon Society and the World Around Us travel series, he brought British Columbia to audiences in many North American cities. He wrote several books (see Bibliography) and is probably best known for Trees, Shrubs and Flowers to Know in British Columbia, plus several other popular field guides on the plants of British Columbia and Washington State. These books have appeared in many revised editions since 1952 and have been used by many outdoors people, tourists, and natural history students and professionals. In his later years, Lyons was an avid bird-watcher and took up landscape painting to depict the essence of ecosystems that were special to him.

The 600 man unit was formed, temporarily, at the inception of a battle by joining four foot companies from a foot regiment of eight companies. The commander of the regiment, an √ñverste (Colonel), led the first battalion and his deputy, an √ñverstel√∂jtnant (Lieutenant Colonel), the second battalion. Battalion commanders and all other officers marched in front of the formation. Non-commissioned officers (underofficers) marched beside and behind to prevent desertion, and to replace officers who were killed. In addition to his principal duties, senior officers, such as Majors, the √ñverstel√∂jtnant and √ñverste, also commanded a company. So that the √ñverste could focus on the operations of his regiment and first battalion, command of his company was delegated to a Kaptenl√∂jtnant. During battle, each officer, except the F√§nriks, was in charge of a portion of his company. Underofficer (NCO) ranks comprised Furir, F√∂rare, F√§ltv√§bel, Sergeant and Rustm√§stare.  Tactics -- Infantry vs Infantry  The formation marched toward the enemy, accompanied by drums, to within from the enemy's line. There, it halted for the third and fourth rows of musketeers to aim and open fire. The march continued some further and halted again for the first and second rows of musketeers to aim and open fire. The zombie like appearance of rapidly approaching Swedes, along with major casualties from the first and second blasts, should induce the enemy to panic and flee, allowing Swedish swords and pikes to kill enemies on the run.

Block looks into the early history of baseball, the debates about baseballs beginnings, and presents new evidence.'Baseball Before We Knew It': What's the French for 'Juiced'? The book received the 2006 Seymour Medal from the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR).\\"Baseball Before We Knew It\\" by David Block to receive the Seymour Medal The account, first published in 1905, that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in 1839 was once widely promoted and widely believed. However, this belief was discredited almost immediately. Although the Doubleday myth was never taken seriously by historians, Block showed that the gospel that supplanted it was also deeply flawed. In this accounting, baseball was understood as the derivation of an English children's game, rounders, but America was allowed to retain patrimony over its national pastime through the assertion that it had been reinvented as a modern sport by the members of the New York Knickerbockers, who codified its rules for the first time in 1845. This idea, according to Block is wrong in almost every aspect. In the book, Block argues that baseball was not a product of rounders, and its essential form had already been established by the late 18th century. Block's new evidence in the matter includes the first known record of the term base-ball in the United States. It came in a 1791 ordinance in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, that banned ballplaying near the town's new meetinghouse. However, that was not the first appearance of \\"base-ball\\" in print. That distinction belongs to an English book, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book (1744). By 1796 the rules of this English game were well enough established to earn a mention in German scholar Johann Gutsmuths book on popular pastimes, that described \\"Englische Base-ball\\" involved a contest between two teams, in which \\"the batter has three attempts to hit the ball while at the home plate\\"; only one out was required to retire a side.Block (2005), pp. 67‚Äì75, 181; Gutsmuths quoted: p. 86. The book also predates the rules laid out by the New York Knickerbockers by nearly fifty years. In the book, Block suggests that it was the English game of baseball that had arrived in the U.S. as part of \\"a sweeping tide of cultural migration\\" during the colonial period. Once on American soil, the game developed popular regional variations that included \\"town-ball\\", \\"round-ball\\" and the \\"New York game\\". English baseball was itself the product of a prolonged, nonlinear evolution. \\"Tut-ball\\" may have been its immediate predecessor. \\"Stool-ball\\", an earlier sport, may have been even more influential in the evolution of baseball, and is also a likely parent of cricket, which developed independently. Medieval texts also suggest that baseball's English antecedents may themselves have descended from Continental bat-and-ball games. An illustration in the French manuscript \\"The Romance of Alexander\\" (1344) depicts a group of monks and nuns engaged in a game, thought to be \\"la soule\\", that looks much like co-ed softball. Two other French games, th√©que and la balle empoison√©e (\\"poisoned ball\\"), also bear similarities to early baseball. They could have migrated to England. In Block's words, the field is clear for the French to claim \\"parental rights over America's National Game.\\" Block also notes in the book that American researchers during the past half-century \\"have made only minimal effort to document baseball's early history and for the most part have not been inclined to go looking to European sources for clues.\\" Notes Bibliography * External links * Baseball Before We Knew It 2005 non-fiction books Baseball books University of Nebraska Press books ","title":"Baseball Before We Knew It"},{"id":"19183735","text":"The Renaissance Society of America (RSA) is an academic association founded in 1954 supporting the study of the Renaissance period, 1300‚Äì1650.

Recruited in late 1862, it fought from the Battle of Chancellorsville through the war until the Army of Northern Virginia's surrender at Appomattox Court House.Bates Its losses during the war were among the highest of any Union regiment.Dyer, Vol. III, p. 1616 History Organization The regiment was recruited in Beaver, Greene, Mercer, and Washington counties, and formally mustered into service on September 8, 1862, at Camp Curtin, under the command of Col. Richard P. Roberts.Bates, Vol. IV, p. 407 The 140th was initially placed on duty guarding the North Central Railway near Parkton, Maryland, and remained there until being ordered to join the Army of the Potomac at Aquia Creek, Virginia, where they arrived on December 12. Here they were assigned to the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, II Army Corps, under the command of Gen. Samuel K. Zook, and proceeded to go into winter quarters near Falmouth, Virginia. 1st Division Badge, II Corps, Army of the Potomac While in winter camp, on January 18, 1863, the regiment received Springfield rifle muskets, to replace their large and unwieldy Vincennes muskets. These were gratefully received by the men, as they had been subjected to continuous mockery by other soldiers with quips such as, ‚ÄúThere goes the walking artillery‚Äù or, ‚ÄúLook at the twelve-pounders!‚Äù Chancellorsville On April 28, the 140th broke camp and marched with the II Corps around Gen. Robert E. Lee‚Äôs left flank, crossing the Rappahannock River at United States Ford and proceeding toward Chancellorsville, where it arrived on May 1 and took its place in the left center of Gen. Joseph Hooker‚Äôs line.Bates, Vol. IV, p. 408 Receiving orders on the evening of May 2 to report to Col.

George Meade, marched there to stop him. On the morning of July 2 the 140th arrived south of the town of Gettysburg, with their 1st Division taking up a position on the left of the II Corps, adjoining the right end of Gen. Daniel Sickles‚Äô III Corps. However, Sickles arbitrarily decided to move his troops out in front of the rest of the Union line, and was soon in trouble, being attacked by Confederates in the afternoon. Thus Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock dispatched the 1st Division to report to Gen.

In September, the 1st Division was reorganized and the 140th was now assigned to the 1st Brigade, under the command of Col. Nelson Miles.Bates, Vol. IV, p. 409 For the remainder of 1863, the regiment was involved in a series of advances and retrograde movements in Northern Virginia with the II Corps, including limited involvement at the Battle of Bristoe Station on October 14, before finally settling into winter encampment.Bates, Vol. IV, pp. 409-10 1864 On May 3, 1864, the 140th broke camp and began their part in what would be known as Overland Campaign, under the command of Gen.

On June 3, the regiment was held in support of pickets on the left while the rest of the Union assault occurred to the north. Having advanced their position and entrenching on June 6, they remained in this position until the 12th. Their losses in the movement to Cold Harbor and the subsequent battle there were 10 officers and men killed, 24 men wounded, and 10 men missing.‚Äô‚ÄôOfficial Records, Series I, Vol. XXXVI, Part I, pp. 384-85 =Petersburg= Grant again uprooted his army, and the II Corps now crossed the James River and advanced on Petersburg. On June 16 the 1st Division joined in an attack on the Confederate entrenchments outside the city, but this would prove to be the beginning of a long siege that would last until April 2, 1865. During this period, the 140th was involved in various movements and smaller battles which comprised the overall siege, including Ream's Station on August 25, and Hatcher's Run February 5‚Äì7, 1865.Bates, Vol. IV, pp. 412-13 End of the War in Eastern Theater With the Union Army‚Äôs breakthrough of the Confederate line on April 2, the 140th now joined in the final pursuit of the remnants of Lee‚Äôs troops, which would include the Battle of Sayler's Creek and their final battle at Farmville on April 7. Lee would finally surrender to Grant on April 9, thus bringing the war to a close in this theater. The regiment took its place in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington, D.C. and was then formally mustered out of service on May 31. Notable members *Henry H.

(American Theater Guide at answers.com)Time magazine- \\"Death of Parker\\", Monday, Apr. 09, 1934 was an American theater and music critic. Time said Parker's \\"reviews were famed\\" and for \\"29 years he had been Boston's oracle on theatre and music.\\" The magazine also said Parker was a \\"great critic\\" as was Philip Hale who died around the same time. Parker was \\"one of the most distinguished critics of his era, respected for his long, thoughtful, and open‚Äêminded reviews.\\" His biographer said ‚ÄúThis remarkable little man of fine perceptions, with his dark eyes burning quizzically in a head bent forward with a sleuthing thrust and emphatic in its nods, was a giant among critics.‚Äù Parker attended Harvard University but was said to have left in displeasure over the number of courses in drama and literature available to him. He worked for several papers newspapers as a correspondent until the 1900s when he became drama and music critic for the New York Globe. In 1905, Parker returned to his native Boston and worked as a critic for the Boston Evening Transcript for the rest of his life. Parker worked during the era when Boston - a city founded by Puritans - had extreme censorship laws causing many artistic works to be \\"Banned in Boston\\". But the theater scene in Boston remained vital helped by \\"excellence of its theatrical criticism as exemplified by the renown of Henry Taylor Parker and Henry Austin Clapp.\\" American Theater Guide: Boston In 1922, Parker wrote the book Eighth Notes: Voices and Figures of Music and the Dance. Eighth Notes: Voices and Figures of Music and the Dance (loot.co.za) Parker was a distinctive character. According to Time: > Critic Parker's initials, all he ever signed, gave him the nicknames of > \\"Hard-to-Please\\" and \\"Hell-to-Pay.\\" But he was seldom vitriolic. His reviews > were famed chiefly for their length (1,250 words, at least), their ornate, > old-fashioned sentences, their freshness and independence of viewpoint. > Boston knew him for a sputtery, gnomelike person who wore a flowing cape for > evening, carried a stout bamboo stick, shunned conversation. He did most of > his writing between 3 and 5 a. m., always in longhand on yellow ruled paper. > Afternoons saw him in his musty, little Transcript office, painstakingly > correcting proof, sorting and editing the world's stage news. No one ever > dared to call his page provincial. Ernest Bloch wrote to Henry Taylor Parker how it \\"is the Jewish soul that interests me, the complex, glowing, agitated soul that I feel vibrating through the Bible.\\" Brandeis University: Ernest Bloch Parker met Virgil Thomson before the young composer left Cambridge, Massachusetts for Paris. Parker arranged for Thomson to critique musical events in Paris for the Boston Evening Transcript, thus starting Thomson's career as a professional critic. Music Academy Online: Virgil Thomson Parker died from pneumonia at age 66 three days before the opening of a Metropolitan Opera visit to Boston that he helped promote. In his obituary it was said the \\"little man was missed at the Friday afternoon Symphony where for years he had sat in the front row of the balcony, the seat beside him vacant.

The project embodies a range of media, including a published book, traveling photographic exhibition, satellite community presentations, and online communities. Overview Fulbeck began the project in 2001, traveling the country photographing over 1200 volunteer subjects who self-identified as Hapa (defined for the project as mixed ethnic heritage with partial roots in Asian and/or Pacific Islander ancestry). Each individual was photographed in a similar minimalist style (directly head-on, unclothed from the shoulders up, and without jewelry, glasses, excess make-up, or purposeful expression). After being photographed, participants chose their own racial/ethnic terms to describe themselves, then responded to the question \\"What are you?\\" in their own handwriting. The photographs, self-descriptions, and handwritten responses were then combined and displayed as a collection. Over 1200 volunteer participants were photographed at dozens of shoots throughout California and Hawaii, as well as Illinois, New York, and Wisconsin. Objective The Hapa Project was created to promote awareness and recognition of the millions of multiracial/multiethnic individuals of Asian/Pacific Islander descent in the U.S; to give voice to multiracial people and previously ignored ethnic groups; to dispel myths of exoticism, hybrid vigor and racial homogeneity; to foster positive identity formation and self-image in multiracial children; and to encourage solidarity and empowerment within the multiracial/Hapa community. Fulbeck also notes that a main objective \\"... was to make the book I wish I owned when I was a kid. I never knew anyone else like me, going through things I went through, not fitting in, always having to choose sides ... Identity is a personal process and I‚Äôm adamant that it should be a personal decision, not one made by a community, a government or others.\\" Use of race as identifier Fulbeck states that despite its utilization of common racial classifications, The Hapa Project is fundamentally a project about identity rather than a project about race: \\"It's about identity using race as a starting point.\\" He argues that race in itself is not biologically determined, but socially created: \\"For the record, race is not a scientifically sound assumption. For example, there is no DNA difference between human beings. We are all African. Biologically, race does not exist. It is a social and cultural construct ... The U.S. is a country with a long history of social genocide (Native Americans, African slavery, etc.) and this was all due to the seeming differences we attributed to race. Yes, it is very convenient to categorize people according to race. It is also extremely inaccurate, however.\\" Conceptual strategies The Hapa Project at the Japanese American National Museum The Hapa Project at the Japanese American National Museum The use of a clinical photographic style combined with the listing of the subject's ethnic heritage alongside their image visually quotes from various pseudo-scientific 18th and 19th century racial studies of Carl Linnaeus, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, and Arthur de Gobineau [See: Spickard, Paul, Almost All Aliens, Routledge, New York, NY 2007] However, Fulbeck's decision to have the subjects self-designate their ethnicity and to include their individual handwritten statements counters this methodology, giving ownership and responsibility to the subjects themselves. As historian Paul Spickard writes, \\"Kip Fulbeck is using the pictures to provoke and encourage his readers. He is using the old form, but with exactly opposite content.\\" [See: Fulbeck, Kip, Part Asian, 100% Hapa, Chronicle Books, San Francisco 2006, p. 261] The project also plays upon and critiques the official photographs each person has taken for their driver's licenses, passports and other forms of identification. A further strategy aimed at diminishing the power dynamic between photographer/subject was to have each participant choose their own image, with the option of re-photographing them if they desired. Fulbeck states, \\"... every participant not only got to write their statement the way they wanted to, they also got to pick their own image. A camera is a tremendously powerful tool and the power dynamic between photographer and subject is palpable. For this reason, I wanted to give some of the power back to the subjects. It was never going to be completely democratic ‚Äì it is, after all, my concept, my project, and my design ‚Äì but there are some strategies you can employ to make it less unilateral. Everyone got to see their image and choose to keep it or erase it and shoot again.\\" One participant was re- photographed 27 times. Offshoot projects Numerous schools and community organizations have created similar projects inspired by Fulbeck's work. Exhibition history Participatory component of The Hapa Project The Hapa Project publicly premiered in 2006 at the Japanese American National Museum with a 5-month solo exhibition entitled \\"kip fulbeck: part asian, 100% hapa.\\" The work has also exhibited at Space180 Gallery (San Francisco), Mandeville Gallery (New York), The Field Museum, University of North Carolina, Oakland University, Northern Arizona University, Santa Clara University, and Woodward Academy, among others. Sixteen images from the series are included in the Science Museum of Minnesota's exhibition Race: Are We So Different? currently touring nationally. Many of the exhibitions include a participatory component where visitors can take part in the project by having their picture taken and writing an individual statement. Public attention The project has received both national and international news coverage, being featured on CNN, MTV, PBS, NPR, and Voice of America. Major newspapers covering the project include The Los Angeles Times, Orange County Register, and Kyoto Journal. It has also been featured on dozens of websites exploring race and identity in the U.S. Book Part Asian, 100% Hapa (Chronicle Books) A book based on the project entitled Part Asian, 100% Hapa was published by Chronicle Books in 2006. It features a foreword by musician Sean Lennon and an afterword by historian Paul Spickard. The book includes portraits and statements from approximately 10% of the overall project participants. Fulbeck has discussed the difficulties in selecting these images from the overall pool, as well the problematic of selecting a single image for the book cover. He also has written about the conscious decision to dispel stereotypes of Hapa people all being conventionally attractive. Influences Fulbeck cites photographer Jim Goldberg and comic artist Lynda Barry as specifically influential to the creation of the project. Lynda Barry also participated in the project and is included in Part Asian, 100% Hapa. Fulbeck also credits historian Paul Spickard as a major influence, particularly his book Mixed Blood: Intermarriage & Ethnic: Intermarriage And Ethnic Identity In Twentieth Century America (University of Wisconsin Press, 1991) [See: Fulbeck, Kip, Part Asian, 100% Hapa, Chronicle Books, San Francisco 2006, pp. 8, 55, 259].

Fulbeck chose participant anonymity both for the safety of the children and as a thematic strategy. \\"...I wanted participants to have as blank a slate as possible to work with, to not be burdened by any pre-existing identifiers. It‚Äôs interesting with celebrities, because celebrities without their gear ‚Äì their look or environment or entourage ‚Äì don‚Äôt look like celebrities. They look like people. And that‚Äôs what I wanted. I could photograph Cher this way and she‚Äôd look like a regular person.\\" Celebrities in the project include Lynda Barry, Wuv Bernardo, Asia Carrera, Karen David, Amy Hill, Sean Lennon, Liz Masakayan, Greg Pak, Sonny Sandoval, and Sandra Tsing Loh. Emerging patterns Two-thirds of the project volunteers were part Japanese-American. An overwhelming majority of participants were female, including some shoots where women outnumbered men 20:1. Current work Fulbeck followed Part Asian, 100% Hapa with the publication of Permanence: Tattoo Portraits by Kip Fulbeck in 2008 and Mixed: Portraits of Multiracial Kids in 2010 (both by Chronicle Books). Both books also had accompanying solo exhibitions. A major speaker on the college circuit, Fulbeck has spoken on The Hapa Project at hundreds of campuses throughout the U.S. He is represented by The Creative Artists Agency in Los Angeles.

She conducts educational programs and passenger trips along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and Canada, and in the Caribbean. The original Virginia The original schooner Virginia was commissioned by the Virginia Pilots Association and designed by naval engineers Cox and Stevens. Pilots Association president William Rowe Boutwell instructed the designers to model the vessel after the America's Cup competitors of the day. She was built by A.C. Brown & Son of Tottenville, Staten Island, New York, and was completed in 1916. Although steamboats were readily available at the time, Virginia was built with no engines so as to maintain the pilots' sailing skills and train new apprentices.Schooner Virginia history, from the Virginia Maritime Heritage Foundation Virginia served actively as a pilot vessel during World War I. Following the war, she was fitted with two 75 hp diesel engines, which necessitated a shortening of her fore boom to accommodate a smokestack. In 1939, Virginia was sold to Walter K. Queen of Boston. She was sold again in 1944, and in 1945 was sold to her final owner, William H. Hoeffer of New York.

The children who survived to adulthood were: *Rosa Clementina (1872-1931), *Ada Flora (1874-1924), *Leila Helena (1876-1951), *Eveline May (1880-1936), *Dora Valentine (1881-1946). All the children grew up in the family home at Maple Lodge, 25 Havelock Road, Addiscombe, Surrey, where their parents lived their whole married lives. Only one of the five girls ever married, the youngest, Dora (1881-1946). She married Albert H. Gilson, a violin and cello repairer, in Croyden in 1922. Rosa was already an accomplished artist by 1892, when she painted her younger sister Dora slumped in a chair with a violin in her hand. A musical family The play hour by Rosa C. Petherick from First Steps. From the Osborne Collection. Courtesy of the Toronto Public Library Her four sisters were talented musicians and played as the Petherick Quartet from about 1905 onwards.. The Strad, the leading periodical of the time dealing with stringed instruments and their music, mentions the quartet five times from April 1905 to March 1908. The Violinist report that they played at the Mozart Society Concert on 15 January 1910. Although Rosa did not play in her sister's quartet she was also a musician. She played briefly in the Streatham Symphony Orchestra in 1920-21. Design competitions Houfe notes that Rosa Petherick participated in design competitions in The Studio. Rosa got honorable mentions for competitions in The Studio: *in June 1896 for designing a private note-paper heading. *in August 1896 for a black and white drawing of Summer. *in November 1900 for an illustration for a Child's Story. She also won honourable mentions for competitions in The International Studio in July 1897 for the following: *Design for the title page of a Christmas Card *Illustration in pen and ink work for The Canterbury Tales *Study of a Female Head Works Horace William Petherick drawn by Rosa in 1900 In 1900, She drew the portrait of her father that he used as the frontpiece for his books on Antonio Stadivari and on Repairing and Restoring Violins. She contributed illustrations to numerous children's story books, annuals and periodicals, particularly those produced by Blackie and Son Limited. According to her obituary in The Times, her etchings could be found in the National Portrait Gallery. Peppin states that although here work was pleasing in appearance ot was somewhat bland and was characterised by uniformly heavy outlines. The British Library Catalogue has 55 of her works listed. The Museum of Croydon has 48 of her works in the Croyden Art Collection. However, this is probably only part of her total output. AbeBooks listed over 60 different titles for sale on 9 February 2020 to which she had contributed. She specialised in paintings and drawings of children with their toys, and commonly shows the children at play with each other or with their toys. Most of her work was for very young children, but she did illustrate a few books, school stories mainly, for older children including:   However, in some cases, the illustrations by her were limited to a single colour frontpiece, and in any case the few examples were vastly outnumbered by the books for much younger children, some of which has illustrations on almost every page.

The basin is elongate, extending approximately 400 miles northwest-southeast, and 200 miles southwest-northeast. Boundaries and sedimentary rocks The basin is bordered on the northeast by the Kankakee Arch, on the southeast by the Cincinnati Arch, on the south by the Pascola Arch, on the southwest by the Ozark Dome, on the northwest by the Mississippi River Arch, and on the north by the Wisconsin Arch. The New Madrid Seismic Zone and the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone intersect the southern portion of the basin. At its center beneath southern Illinois, the basin contains a thickness of about 15,000 feet of Cambrian through Pennsylvanian sedimentary rocks, predominantly marine, and mostly dolomite, limestone, shale, and sandstone.David H. Swann, \\"A summary geologic history of the Illinois Basin,\\" in Geology and Petroleum Production of the Illinois Basin, Illinois Geologic Society, 1968, p.3-21. The basement rocks deep below the sedimentary rocks of the basin are Proterozoic granites and rhyolite of the Eastern Granite‚ÄìRhyolite Province which dates to around 1.55 Ga.Van Schmus, W.R., et al., 2007, New insights into the southern margin of the Archean‚ÄìProterozoic boundary in the north-central United States based on U-Pb, Sm-Nd, and Ar-Ar geochronology, Precambrian Research, v. 157, p. 80‚Äì105, .Ben A. Van der Pluijm, Paul A. Catacosinos, Basement and basins of eastern North America, Geological Society of America, Special Paper 308, 1996, p. 14 Mineral resources The rocks of the Illinois Basin are sources of coal, petroleum, and other minerals. Coal Bituminous coal is present in Pennsylvanian rocks in the basin, deposited in freshwater swamp environments. Over the years, the Illinois Basin has produced more than eight billion tons of coal in Southern Illinois, particularly in the Harrisburg Coal Field, and the Western Coal Fields of Kentucky.US Geological Survey, A rebirth of the Illinois Basin, retrieved 29 October 2009. Coal production was 99 million short tons in 2008, roughly equally divided between Illinois, Indiana, and western Kentucky. The basin provided 8% of US coal production in 2008.F. Freme, \\"Coal review,\\" Mining Engineering, May 2009, p.52. Petroleum Pumpjacks operating in White County, Illinois The Illinois Basin has produced more than four billion barrels of petroleum. Major oil production began in 1905, and from 1907 through 1912, the basin was the third-most oil productive area in the United States. Oil production peaked in 1908 at 34 million barrels per year, and declined steadily to 5 million barrels in 1933. A new wave of exploration brought oil production to a new high of 140 million barrels in 1940, after which production again declined.Harold F. Williamson and others, The American Petroleum Industry, 1899-1958, Evanstion, Ill.: Northwestern Univ. Press, 1963, p.16, 25, 540. Waterflooding of old reservoirs caused a third peak of oil production in the 1950s. Much recent drilling activity has targeted shale gas in the Devonian-Mississippian New Albany Shale. Nonfuel minerals The rocks of the Illinois Basin are thought to be the source of metals in Mississippi Valley-Type lead-zinc deposits, both within the basin and in surrounding areas, such as the Lead Belt of southeast Missouri. Within the basin, deposits valuable for lead, zinc, coal balls and fluorite are mined in Hardin and Pope counties, Illinois, and Crittenden and Livingston counties, Kentucky. the deposits are in the form of veins and limestone replacement deposits in Mississippian sedimentary rocks. Ore minerals are fluorite, galena, and sphalerite. Gangue minerals include common quartz and calcite, and minor barite and chalcopyrite.Robert M. Grogan and James C. Bradbury, \\"Fluorite-zinc-lead deposits of the Illinois-Kentucky mining district,\\" in Ore Deposits in the United States, New York: American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers (AIME), 1968, v.1, p.370-399. Carbon sequestration Some geologic formations in the Illinois Basin are considered to have potential for carbon sequestration, as a permanent disposal site for carbon dioxide that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. In 2009, Archer Daniels Midland Corp. began pilot testing the carbon sequestration potential of the Mt. Simon formation beneath its ethanol manufacturing facility in Illinois.Archer Daniels Midland, Carbon-sequestration projects put innovative emissions-reduction technology to the test , accessed 26 February 2010 As of January 2015, one million metric tons of carbon dioxide had been sequestered in the Illinois Basin-Decatur Project.

Lovelace's memoir chronicles the challenges of growing up in a family in which four out of five members suffer from bipolar disorder, including Lovelace himself. Only his sister, who is a professional therapist, was spared the ravages of bipolar disorder, while both his parents, his brother, and himself, have suffered to differing degrees over the years. Lovelace has written poetry, some of which has been nominated for the Pushcart Prize and the Patterson Review's Allen Ginsberg Award. He currently resides in western Massachusetts with his wife and children. Description The front entrance to The Bookmill in Montague, Massachusetts. A native of Massachusetts, Lovelace's relationship with bipolar disorder began at an early age, when his mother, an artist, suffered from severe bouts of depression, and later when his father, a Professor of Theology at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, exhibited increasingly eccentric behavior. He and his brother followed suit with their own symptoms as they grew up, developing similar mood and psychological disorders, a common problem for the family‚Äîexcepting Lovelace's sister, who has always had her mental health‚Äîwhich they privately termed the \\"whim-whams\\".http://www.audioport.org/index.php?op=program- info&program;_id=21054&nav;=& The memoir uses ample humor to chronicle Lovelace's childhood and his early adulthood growing up in and around Hamilton, Massachusetts with bipolar disorder; it shines a light on the positive aspects of bipolar disorder, such as the remarkable creative gifts it can bestow upon the afflicted, while being, unfortunately, totally devastating on other occasions. Reception Scattershot is described by Alex Miller in the Vail Daily as \\"disturbing in places\\", yet \\"funny in others\\". In comparison to other memoirs, he states that \\"it‚Äôs very evenly portrayed, without any finger-pointing\\". Whitney Spotts of the Lansing State Journal states that \\"the author manages to convey the dark corners of bi-polar disorder from a tender, understanding place.\\" Publishers Weekly praised \\"Lovelace's poetic prose [as] both matter-of-fact and haunted, capturing the unpredictable rhythms of mental illness\\" and believed \\"[r]eaders will get a real sense of the interior world of a single patient, and a family, on the verge of a mental breakdown.\\" Eric Liebetrau, in the Charleston City Paper, writes that \\"Lovelace's prose mimics his fragile mental condition, accelerating to a breathless poetry during his manic phases and slowing to a near-catatonic whisper during the depressive phases.\\"\\"SCATTERSHOT: My Bipolar Family: A Memoir.\\" Kirkus Reviews 76, no. 13 (July 2008): 690-690., Abstract: The article reviews the book \\"Scattershot: My Bipolar Family: A Memoir,\\" by David Lovelace.

Formerly this archipelago provided an ideal ecosystem for the Caspian seal. Sturgeons are still found where the waters are not too polluted.

She was a Princess of Commagene by marriage to Gaius Julius Archelaus Antiochus Epiphanes. Life Capitolina came from a distinguished family of Equestrian rank. She was born and raised in Alexandria, Egypt. Capitolina was the daughter and only child of Tiberius Claudius Balbilus by his unnamed wife. The cognomen Capitolina, is probably from her maternal side. Her father was one of the highest magistrates of Equestrian rank that served in Rome. Balbilus was an astrologer and a learned scholar, who was later Prefect of Egypt. Capitolina‚Äôs paternal grandfather, was an Egyptian Greek Grammarian and Astrologer called Thrasyllus of Mendes or Tiberius Claudius Thrasyllus, who was a friend of the Roman Emperor Tiberius, while her paternal grandmother was Greek Princess Aka II of Commagene, who was a great, granddaughter of King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene. Her paternal cousin was Ennia Thrasylla who married the Praetorian prefect of the Praetorian Guard, Naevius Sutorius Macro. Commagene  In 64, Capitolina married a Greek Prince from the Kingdom of Commagene called Gaius Julius Archelaus Antiochus Epiphanes, who was a paternal second cousin to Capitolina. She is not mentioned by Roman Sources, however has been identified as the wife of Epiphanes and mother of Epiphanes‚Äô children, through surviving honorific inscriptions and surviving honorific poetry dedicated to her. After Epiphanes married Capitolina, they settled and lived in the court of her father-in-law King Antiochus IV of Commagene. The relationship between Capitolina and Epiphanes is unknown. Capitolina bore Epiphanes in 65 their first son and child Gaius Julius Antiochus Epiphanes Philopappos in Samosata. Capitolina lived in Commagene from 64 until 72. In 72 Lucius Caesennius Paetus, the Roman Governor of Syria had sent letters addressed to Roman Emperor Vespasian accusing Antiochus IV, Epiphanes and Epiphanes‚Äô brother Callinicus in planning to revolt against Rome and allying themselves with the King of Parthia. Paetus accused in these letters that Antiochus IV, Epiphanes and Callinicus of disloyalty to the Emperor. It is not known whether if these accusations were true or false. After reading the letters, Vespasian felt that he could no longer trust the family of Antiochus IV and couldn‚Äôt trust them to protect the strategic crossing at the Euphrates River at Samosata. Vespasian gave orders to Antiochus IV to terminate his rule in Commagene. Paetus invaded the Kingdom of Commagene, as head of the Legio VI Ferrata. The client Kings Aristobulus of Chalcis and Sohaemus of Emesa also supplied troops to Paetus. They all arrived the night before the Battle. As Epiphanes and Callinicus prepared themselves that night for war, Antiochus IV was preparing to flee to Cilicia. The next morning that the war was supposed to occur Epiphanes with Capitolina and their son with Callinicus out of fear of the Romans fled to the King of Parthia, while Antiochus IV also out of fear of the Romans fled to Cilicia. There is a possibility that Epiphanes and Callinicus had a short-lived attempt to resist invasion, before they fled to Parthia. Later life The family of Antiochus IV had let their own army and the citizens of Commagene down. Antiochus IV and his family never considered to cause a war with Rome and they wanted to clear themselves of these accusations. Vespasian brought peacefully back to Rome, Epiphanes; Capitolina, their son with Callinicus in an honourable Roman Military Escort. Capitolina; Epiphanes, their son with Callinicus lived in Rome with Antiochus IV for the remainder of his life. Vespasian had given Antiochus IV and his family sufficient revenue to live on. Antiochus IV and his family had a glamorous life and were treated with great respect. In 72, Capitolina bore Epiphanes another child, a daughter named Julia Balbilla in Rome. After the death of Antiochus IV, Capitolina; Epiphanes and their family moved and finally settled in Athens Greece. Capitolina‚Äôs father died in 79. Balbilus was a friend to the first Roman Emperors, including Vespasian. Vespasian thought very highly of him and dedicated a sporting festival called the Balbillean Games, named and held in honor of his memory which was held at Ephesus from 79 well into the 3rd century. In Ephesus, there are surviving inscriptions in Capitolina‚Äôs name and in her late father‚Äôs name. These surviving inscriptions are honorific ones, which dedicate and honor Capitolina as the daughter of Balbilus and as an honorary participate of the Balbillean Games at Ephesus. After the death of Epiphanes in Athens in 92, Capitolina returned to Alexandria. Capitolina lived her remaining years in Egypt and married the politician Marcus Junius Rufus between 94-98. Her son remained in Athens where he became a prominent citizen. Her daughter became a prominent poet and became a travelling friend to the Roman Emperor Hadrian and wife Roman Empress Vibia Sabina. In a surviving poem written by Balbilla dedicated to the memory to her parents and her grandfathers, Balbilla describes her parents as ‚Äòpious‚Äô people and writes very highly of her ancestry.

Henry Inman Historian Upon returning from military service, \\"he did not apply himself to the practice of law,\\" according to his obituary in the New York Times. Instead, \\"having strong literary tastes, [Hamilton] devoted himself to the study of history, with a view to writing his father's life.\\" Between 1834 and 1840, Hamilton read, sorted, and organized his father's letters and other papers, and wrote a two-volume biography titled The Life of Alexander Hamilton. The biography was published in 1840‚Äì1841; however, nearly all copies were destroyed in a fire while in the process of binding. During the next decade, Hamilton edited his father's collected writings under the authority of the Joint Library Committee of the United States Congress. The seven-volume authorized edition, The Works of Alexander Hamilton: Containing His Correspondence, and His Political and Official Writings, Exclusive of the Federalist, Civil and Military, was published by order of Congress in 1850‚Äì1851. Hamilton also wrote a biography in seven volumes, published between 1857 and 1864, titled Life of Alexander Hamilton: A History of the Republic of the United States of America. The work combined a biography of his father with a history of the United States \\"as traced in his writings and in those of his contemporaries.\\" After several other biographers had abandoned the project, Hamilton had been prompted to write the comprehensive biography by his mother, who died prior to its publication. In 1869, Hamilton published an edition of The Federalist, with historical notes and commentary. Politics Hamilton was a member of the Whig Party and later a Republican, but never held elected office, having lost a run for Congress to represent part of New York City. His opinions on economics were at different times solicited by Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Chester A. Arthur. Later life In 1880, he presented a statue of Alexander Hamilton to the city of New York, \\"though preferring it were the act of others.\\" At the November 22, 1880, unveiling of the statue in Central Park near the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he said that after a century of the nation's existence, time had shown \\"the utility of [Hamilton's] public services and the lessons of his polity,\\" and that he trusted \\"that this memorial may aid in their being recalled and usefully appreciated.\\" On July 25, 1882, the 89-year-old Hamilton died at Stockton Cottage, on Ocean Avenue in Long Branch, New Jersey, due to complications of jaundice and catarrh. His funeral was held at Trinity Church in Manhattan.

Conv., (died before 1513) was a Spanish friar of the Conventual Franciscans and companion of Christopher Columbus. Life At one time P√©rez held the office of contador (accountant) to the Queen of Spain, showing he was of noble family. Later he entered the Franciscan Order and Queen Isabella chose him for her confessor. Finding court life distracting he asked permission to retire to his friary. Soon after he was elected guardian of the friary in La R√°bida, near Palos in Andalusia. Father Francisco Gonzaga, Minister General of the Observant branch of the Order (1579‚Äì87), declared that La R√°bida belonged to the Franciscan Custody of Seville, which, by decree of Pope Alexander VI on 21 September 1500, was raised to the rank of a province. Here Christopher Columbus in 1484 or 1485 made the acquaintance of P√©rez. Friar Antonio de Marchena, a cosmographer of some note, also lived there, and in him the navigator discovered a man bent on the project of discovering a new world. The historian Francisco L√≥pez de G√≥mara in 1552 seems to have started the blunder, copied by almost every subsequent writer on the subject, of making the two names Perez and Marchena serve to describe one and the same person by speaking of the Father Guardian of La R√°bida as Friar Juan Perez de Marchena.Charles Warren Currier, History of Religious Orders (1894), p. 661. Both friars materially assisted Columbus, who acknowledges his obligation in one of his letters to the king and queen. He writes that everybody ridiculed him, save two friars who always remained faithful. Mart√≠n Fern√°ndez de Navarrete, indeed, claims that Columbus in this passage spoke of P√©rez, the Franciscan, and Diego de Deza, the Dominican.As the latter was Bishop of Palencia when the navigator wrote his letter, and Columbus on all other occasions speaks of him as Bishop of Palencia, or Lord Bishop, it would seem strange that in this one instance he should omit the title. Deza aided Columbus to the best of his ability among the scientists of Salamanca; but he could not prevent the adverse decision of the Spanish Court. It was P√©rez who persuaded the navigator not to leave Spain without consulting Isabella, when, footsore and dispirited, he arrived at La R√°bida, determined to submit his plan to the King of France. At the invitation of the queen, P√©rez made a journey to Santa Fe for a personal interview with her. As a result, Columbus was recalled, and with the assistance of Cardinal Mendoza and others his demands were finally granted. When the navigator at last on 3 August 1492, set sail in the Santa Mar√≠a, P√©rez blessed him and his fleet. Some writers assert that P√©rez accompanied Columbus on the first voyage, but the silence of Columbus on this point renders the claim improbable. It appears certain, however, that P√©rez joined his friend on the second voyage in 1493. The earliest and best writers also agree: that when the second expedition reached Hispaniola, P√©rez celebrated the first Mass in the New World at Point Conception on 8 December 1493, in a temporary structure; that this was the first church in America; and that P√©rez preserved the Blessed Sacrament there. He also became the guardian of the first friary which Columbus ordered to be erected in Santo Domingo. There all trace of him is lost. Whether he returned to La R√°bida or died in America is uncertain. All we know is that, in the legal dispute between Diego and Columbus, the royal fiscal (attorney general), Dr. Garc√≠a Hern√°ndes, testified in 1513 that P√©rez was then dead.

He was signed by the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL) as an undrafted free agent in 2008 and also played for the Kansas City Chiefs. He retired from the NFL after seven seasons due to multiple concussions sustained during his career and concern for his future health. Abdullah played college football at Washington State. He is the younger brother of former NFL safety Hamza Abdullah. High school Abdullah attended Pomona High School and was most well known for his athletics. In high school, Abdullah received many honorable awards as he represented his school football team as captain. Abdullah is a defensive back and also is a contributor to the special teams unit as a kick returner. During Abdullah's sophomore year, he was awarded the team's defensive MVP and was nominated as rookie of the year. During his junior year, Abdullah won the All-Inland Valley award and as a senior, Abdullah stood as the number 9 ranked safety in the west coast. Professional career Minnesota Vikings Abdullah was an undrafted rookie who later signed with the Minnesota Vikings. He served as a backup from 2008 to 2009. Before the 2010 season he was named the starting strong safety. The competition in the offseason and preseason was thought to be between Tyrell Johnson and Jamarca Sanford, but Abdullah won the job. During the 2011 season, Abdullah became the starting free safety, but a concussion (his fourth in 15 months) ended his season. Kansas City Chiefs After he returned from a year off, Abdullah accepted a one-year contract offer from the Chiefs, and played in all 16 games (starting 2) of the 2013 season; he also started the Chiefs' playoff game against Indianapolis, making 2 interceptions in that game to tie a team playoff record. An unrestricted free agent after the season, Abdullah re-signed with the Chiefs on March 12, 2014. During a Monday Night Football game on September 29, 2014 against the New England Patriots, Abdullah intercepted a pass, returning it for a touchdown. He was given a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for sliding on his knees, then bowing down and giving praise in Islamic salutation. The next day, the NFL said the penalty was a misapplication of the relevant rule, and should not have been assessed. The penalty created much controversy on social media, including beyond America. Retirement Abdullah retired from football on March 28, 2016, citing concern over the five concussions he had accumulated during his career. He later explained the decision further in an essay submitted to The Players Tribune. Personal life Abdullah is the son to Yusuf and Sa'eeda Johnwell. He lived in a very large family, one of 12 children. As a practicing Muslim, Abdullah observes fasting in Ramadan‚Äîeven during the football season. He sat out the 2012‚Äì2013 season to make Hajj to Mecca with his brother Hamza Abdullah, who was also in the NFL.

A native of Johore in Maritime Southeast Asia, Kabungsuwan re-settled in Mindanao in the Philippines where he preached Islam to the native tribes around the region. Origin Maguindanao genealogy records state that Kabungsuwan's father was an Arab and a sharif or a descendant of the Islamic Prophet Mohammed while his mother was Malay. His recorded name \\"Kabungsuwan\\" in Maguindanao tradition means \\"youngest\\" and is said to the be the youngest among three children. His eldest brother, Ahmad is said to have established the Bruneian Sultanate while his other brother Alawi is said to have set up the Sulu Sultanate. Mission work in Mindanao Kabungsuwan is generally regarded as the one who introduced Islam in the Lanao and Maguindanao areas in Mindanao arriving in the area in the early 16th century. There are several tarsilas or written genealogy on Kabungsuwan though most of these state that he brought in men when he landed in Mindanao, his group are composed of seafarers, there was initial force with his group's interaction with the locals and that there were already Muslims in Mindanao when his Kangungsuwan and his men landed near the mouth of the Pulangi River. Kabungsuwan formed alliances with influential royal families of Sulu, Borneo, and Ternate. This led to Islam becoming the dominant religion around Lake Lanao by the 19th century. Personal life Kabungsuwan traded in T'buk (old name of Malabang) Malabang, Lanao, married to the native princess of Iranun. Kabungsuwan was of Arab-Malay ethnicity. He married a local princess and established the Sultanate of Maguindanao in the 16th century. The sultanate was usually centered in the valley of Cotabato. Legacy The former province of Shariff Kabunsuan in the Philippines was named after him.

The series was created by Gregg Taylor of Decoder Ring Theatre and earned the company multiple Podcast Award and Parsec Award nominations. In 2010 the series won the Parsec Award for excellence in Speculative Fiction Audio Drama (Long Form), and earned Decoder Ring Theatre the Podcast Award for best podcast in the Cultural/Arts Category. The series has spawned a series of novels written within continuity and in the style of the classic pulp fiction stories of the 1930s and 1940s. The Tales of the Red Panda books includes the 2011 winner of the Pulp Ark Award for best New Pulp Fiction Novel, Tales of the Red Panda: The Android Assassins. Decoder Ring Theatre was profiled on the BBC Television program \\"Click\\" in February 2011, leading to new exposure for the Red Panda Adventures in the UK. The radio drama series also inspired a spin-off series of comic book adventures published digitally by MonkeyBrain Comics, and collected in trade paperback edition by IDW Publishing. The comic books, written by series author Gregg Taylor and illustrated by artist Dean Kotz have been highly praised by industry media outlets such as Comic Book Resources and Bleeding Cool. Both the audio drama and comic series have been featured in the Toronto Star, and the Television program \\"Innerspace\\" on Space, the Imagination Station  Current series  Seasons 1-9 of The Red Panda Adventures each ran for 12 episodes. Seasons 10 and 11 were each six episodes long, with a new episode released on the first of every other month, alternating with Black Jack Justice. Episodes Tales of the Red Panda Novels The Tales of the Red Panda novel series is written by Gregg Taylor and styled after Golden Age hero pulp magazines like The Shadow, Doc Savage and The Spider. The novels tell new stories set in the same continuity as the audio drama, with events from one sometimes being mentioned in the other. *The Crime Cabal (June 2009) *The Mind Master (December 2009) *The Android Assassins (August 2010) *The Pyramid of Peril (September 2014) Mask of the Red Panda Comics right Announced on December 13, 2012 on the official Facebook page, Mask of the Red Panda was a 3-issue digital comic miniseries available via Comixology.

The art is provided by Dean Kotz, and it is published by MonkeyBrain Comics. IDW Publishing released a trade paperback edition of the miniseries in February 2014. After the initial three-issue series a Kickstarter campaign was run to create a \\"full-cast video comic\\" of the series. The intent was to raise money for not only the video, but also to fund new issues of the comic. At the close of the campaign, Taylor announced that enough money had been raised to provide for at least 8 new issues of the series. Beginning with issue 4 in March 2014, the comic series was renamed The Red Panda. Taylor began telling comic stories in two parts, adding bonus features to the digital releases. Dramatis Personae =The Terrific Twosome of Toronto= *The Red Panda: The Red Panda is a hero in the mystery man mold of the pulp era. His costume is limited to a suit and hat with a bright red domino mask (with Batman-like blank eyes) and matching red gauntlets. He has great skill with unarmed combat styles (especially judo) and uses a variety of devices, mostly of his own devising, to fight injustice. These include Static Shoes which use the power of static electricity to cling to sheer surfaces, and to jump great distances when traveling over rooftops. He is also a master of hypnotism, which he uses to extract information, project false images into the minds of others and, when necessary, to erase the memories of others. When not patrolling the city as the marvelous masked mystery man known as the Red Panda, he reverts to his secret identity, August Fenwick (known only as \\"one of the city's wealthiest men\\" until episode 48 \\"Operation: Cold Feet\\"), a young millionaire/billionaire playboy (the amount has fluctuated throughout the series). In this guise, he bears many similarities to Bruce Wayne, Lamont Cranston and Don Diego Vega, though in a much lighter tone. It is mentioned repeatedly throughout the series that the Red Panda hates having to put on the mask of the spoiled, selfish rich boy: \\"[the Red Panda] became who I am. The spoiled rich boy became more of a thin character sketch than a person.\\" The Red Panda fights crime for many reasons, first and foremost because of an altruistic desire to help those who can't help themselves, but also out of a desire to atone for the selfish, greed-driven actions of his family. \\"Great acts of cruelty were committed by men I knew to be kind.\\" Voiced by Gregg Taylor. *The Flying Squirrel: Katya \\"Kit\\" Baxter, sidekick and driver of the Red Panda, is head over heels for \\"The Boss\\", whose secret identity she discovered on her own, and whom she convinced to let her help. Her costume consists of a gray catsuit and cowl (or as the Red Panda puts it, \\"a delightfully form-fitting unitard\\"), goggles, and a utility belt (though she does think it makes her look \\"hippy\\"). Only scattered bits of information about her appearance have been revealed. What is known is that she is 5 ft. 6, in her early 20s, has red hair and brown eyes, and after her recent stint at the beach, also has freckles. She has a vicious streak when it comes to dealing with criminals. Like the Red Panda, she uses a wide array of crime- fighting gizmos including Static Shoes, Grapple Guns and Gas Grenades. But while he would turn to hypnosis for interrogation, she is more likely to use her fists, which she does with great glee. She has the skill to back up her pugilistic tendencies; thanks to the training of the Red Panda, this former taxi driver is now a black belt in jujitsu, judo, and possibly other fighting styles including professional boxing which is partly due to the fact that her father was a boxer and she picked up a few things from him as she grew up. The gliding membranes in her squirrel suit allow her to glide short distances and perform amazing feats of acrobatic daring-do. The relationship between the two heroes is the heart of the show, with Kit desperately trying to clue the Red Panda in to her feelings, only to be thwarted time and time again by his total obliviousness. The two finally come out with their emotions when Kit is thought to be dead by the Red Panda and he kisses her when she springs back to life. From the start of the fifth season, the couple are married, and the introductory narrative has been updated.

He might also be the kid who sells special [also known as 'extra'] editions to the Chronicle whenever newspaper headlines figure in the show. Harry has the sharp sight and exceptional observation powers of innocent youth. He often notices things other agents seem to miss. In the episode \\"The Rat Lord\\", Harry gained a code name: the Black Cap. By \\"All the King's Men\\" he is 16, almost 17. Voiced by Shannon Arnold (young Harry) and Scott Moyle (teenage Harry). *Spiro Pappas (Agent #?): A Contact Man for some of the Red Panda's agents, including Constable Parker. Even at age 65 he is still a formidable combatant, as evidenced in his undercover work as a member of the \\"Callahan Gang\\". Owns a training facility for prizefighters.

Voiced by Michael Booth. *Old Mister Finelman (Agent #?): A pharmacist and a Contact Man for some of the Red Panda's agents, including Harry Kelly. *William Bilkey (Agent #?): A file clerk in the Harbormaster's Office and an agent of the Red Panda. *Myron McKellar (Agent #?): An orderly at the Queen Street Lunatic Sanitarium for the Criminally Deranged and an agent of the Red Panda.

Tortured and killed by the Electric Eel and/or the Genie in \\"Trial by terror\\". Voiced by Brian Vaughn. *Dr. Davis (Agent #?): One of the world's most renowned biochemists. As one of the Red Panda's many agents at the oft-mentioned and as yet unnamed local university, Dr. Davis gave the Red Panda and the Flying Squirrel immunity to their own knockout gas and formulated the antitoxin against the madness drug in \\"The Hand of Fate.\\" *Bert Mendel(Agent #?): A coroner and very skittish agent of the Red Panda. Though he did aid our masked heroes with morgue advice in both \\"Riddle of the Sphinx\\" and \\"The Hand of Fate,\\" he did so reluctantly and with little enthusiasm, more concerned with keeping his job than helping the city. Not a great deal is known about him, but it is hinted that he serves the Red Panda as part of a life debt from a previous daring rescue. Voiced by Scott Moyle. *Dr. Theodore Chronopolis: Scientist, inventor and the foremost expert on the combination of magic and science. The good Doctor has an unfinished time machine in Season One of RPA (mentioned in episode 3 \\"Rabbit Season\\") that was possibly completed sometime prior to the Season Two finale episode 24, \\"The World Next Door\\", and used by the Red Panda in a previously untold adventure to travel to the past, possibly in an adventure hinted at in episode 12, \\"The Deadliest Game\\". He is very disorganized and absent-minded, but is very friendly and well mannered. Apparently, is counterpart from the other the world next door is some kind of supervillain. Lost his memory in \\"The Wild West\\". Voiced by Peter Nicol. *Tom Tomorrow: Heroic \\"Man of the Future\\". Equipped with Rocket Boots and other amazing futuristic gizmos. Formerly a member of the Justice Union, he was evicted from the group after a binding resolution was passed against temporal beings. Died defending England from the Nazi invasion. Voiced by Jonathan Llyr. *The Stranger: Maxwell Falconi, international stage magician and mystic protector of the mortal realm. One of the first masked mystery men and one of the Red Panda's mentors. His catchphrase was \\"Danger was my constant companion\\". He was apparently quite successful, considering that Kit Baxter recognized the phrase and remembered the outfit even after he had been long retired. Officially works under the rule of the Council of Mages, but disobeys their rules about not interfering in mortal affairs. Retired member of The Society of Gentlemen Adventurers. Reenter the world of magic the fight the Nazi's in the occult war. Sacrificed himself in order prevent them from getting their hands on the most powerful objects. Voiced by Peter Higginson. *Lady Prianne Harcourne: An agent of the Council of Mages. Voiced by Crysta Luszczek. *Chief O'Mally: Chief of the Toronto Police and the official guardian of law and order in the city. Despite his gruff nature, he is a good man and does his best to protect the people of Toronto. An example of this passionate side of him appears in his argument with the Flying Squirrel in \\"The Callahan Mob\\". When she brought up dealing with the criminals, he responded hotly, \\"If beating the living daylights out of them would've put a stop to this, I'd have put my badge in a drawer and taken a squad down there months ago!\\" He began the series with a healthy dislike of the Terrific Twosome of Toronto that bordered on hate, but as time passed he has gained a grudging respect for the masked heroes. He still doesn't like them, but he recognizes that they are able to deal with foes he can't, and his desire to protect the city wins out over his annoyance. Voiced by Michael Booth and Christopher Mott. *Baboon McSmoothie/Brian McSweeney: Time-traveling, dimension-jumping Man of a Thousand Faces from a parallel future universe. In the real world he is revealed to be a thief for hire working for the Australians named Brian McSweeney. Voiced by Gregory Z. Cooke. *Marie, the Voodoo Priestess: A profoundly mysterious individual. First appearing in \\"The Empty Box\\", Marie (though that is a pseudonym, her real name is unknown) is a priestess of the ancient ritual magics of Africa, known to the uninitiated as Voodoo. An old friend of the Stranger, she should have been advanced in years, but thanks to her abilities she didn't appear older than 40. The Flying Squirrel sought her counsel on the advice of Maxwell Falcone in pursuit of Professor Hex. Though certainly not an enemy, it would be difficult to call Marie a friend. She seems to have an outlook on life and the world far different than that of our masked heroes. As she said, \\"there is nothing, neither good nor bad, but thinking makes it so. There is no power in the world so great in its goodness that it cannot be turned to evil.\\" Voiced by Julie Cogger. *Red Squirrel: Kim Fenwick, Kit Baxter's great-great-granddaughter, who traveled back from the future to stop the supervillain The Puppeteer from killing the Flying Squirrel or the Red Panda to get the Red Squirrel out of his way. The thought was that if Kim no longer had one or both of the Terrific Twosome of Toronto as heroic inspiration, she would have never become a superhero at all, or at least she would be a less effective one. Little is known about the Red Squirrel's background, but a few details can be gleaned. She looks almost exactly the same as Kit, so much so that the shock of the resemblance broke the Red Panda's hypnotic probe. The author has commented that she is still somewhat new to her role as a costumed crimefighter, which was hinted when the Red Panda easily tricked her into revealing herself during their first meeting. Mr. Taylor also speculated that she had traveled back from sometime between 2012 and 2021, with her birth occurring sometime in the 1990s. Several details in the episode point to her being part of a government team rather than a lone vigilante, such as having a headquarters and being warned that her maneuver was \\"against regulations. We could get in a lot of trouble.\\" The Red Squirrel has several powerful abilities, including some that bear a striking resemblance to those of the Red Panda and the Flying Squirrel. She can fly, has some limited hypnotic powers (only inducing sleep instead of picking apart memories), and has a costume strong enough to deflect bullets. The Red Squirrel is \\"apparently\\" the g-g-granddaughter of Kit Baxter and The Red Panda, indicated by her comment \\"Who do you think put the Red in the Red Squirrel?\\" Voiced by Denise Anderson. *Captain Tom Sunlight: A daring, high- flying, presumably American adventurer and ally of the Red Panda. He apparently owes the crimefighter a favor and attempted to kill Professor Von Schlitz at the Red Panda's request, although it was later revealed that this attempt failed. Largely regarded as a nod to Captain Midnight. Voiced by Christopher Mott. *Colonel Archibald FitzRoy: A career espionage agent put in charge of forming and managing the Home team. Killed in \\"There Will Be Rain Tonight\\". *\\"Captain\\": A mysterious, nameless woman that took command of the Home Team when FitzRoy was killed, In \\"From the Ashes\\", it¬¥s revealed to have been given the rank of Major. *Wentworth James/Doc. Rocket: A millionaire inventor that become Doc. Rocket after a run-in with the Genie. Member of the Home Team. *John Archer/John Doe: An automaton created by Captain Clockwork that imprinted itself on a woman and took on a personality bent on doing good. His wife was killed in an explosion and he was badly injured in \\"There Will Be Rain Tonight\\". Assumes the role of the Red Panda in \\"From the Ashes\\", to keep moral up and to get revenge for the murder of his wife. Voiced by Christopher Mott. *Prof. Maximillion \\"Molecule Max\\" Wisemen: A Jewish American Superhero that helped the Canadians before the US joined the war. His superpower is the ability to rearrange particles so that a person or object appears bigger or smaller. Killed in \\"There Will Be Rain Tonight\\". *Dark Angel: Member of the Home Team. Killed in \\"There Will Be Rain Tonight\\". *Green Guardian: Member of the Home Team. Killed in \\"There Will Be Rain Tonight\\". *The Danger Federation: A young group of heroes set up in place of the Home Team under the guidance of the Red Panda. **Eagle Man: Member of the Danger Federation. **Jenny Swift: Member of the Danger Federation. Her power is super-speed. **Titanic Man: Member of the Danger Federation. **Blue Bomber: Member of the Danger Federation. His super-heroics are sponsored by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers football team. **Doctor Improbable: Member of the Danger Federation. **Molecule Max II: Member of the Danger Federation.

As a tribute to his mentor, he carries on under the Molecule Max guise. **Mr. Amazing: Member of the Danger Federation. He set out to destroy the Danger Federation and prove himself to be the superior hero. After he was defeated by the Red Panda, he was voted in as a member of the team. **Mystic: Member of the Danger Federation. **White Knight: Android member of the Danger Federation. **Star Lass: Member of the Danger Federation. Last surviving member of a lost alien civilization. **Grey Fox: Member of the Danger Federation at the request of the Flying Squirrel. Grey Fox is a Japanese- Canadian heroine who was first encountered by the Flying Squirrel during a trip to Vancouver. She was detained in an internment camp due to her Japanese ancestry until the Danger Federation arranged her release. Voiced by Andrea Lyons. = The Forces of Evil = *The Sphinx: Mike Murtoch, a master safe- cracker turned teleporting cat burglar with the supernatural aid of an ancient Egyptian amulet and a pair of mystic sapphires. He also bore the powerful Ankh of Sutek, which has the ability to instantly mummify any living flesh it touches. Voiced by M. John Kennedy. *Professor Zombie: Antonia Zombanistro, a scientist, necromancer and inventor of the chemical Necronium 234, which has the power to turn people into zombies. In the banter between Professor Zombie and the Red Panda in \\"Night Patrol\\" it is hinted that they might have had a more complicated relationship in the past. Voiced by Andrea Lyons. *Jackrabbit: Thief, murderer and speedster all rolled into one. Though the details of her past are somewhat sketchy, it is known that she was an unusually fast circus performer whose speed was further enhanced by the beneficence of the fallen socialite Peter Urskin. Her character has gained depth of late when it was revealed in \\"The Terrible Two\\" that she was in love with the Mad Monkey in a villainous mirror image of the relationship between Kit Baxter and the Red Panda. Voiced by Julie Florio. *The Golden Claw: A criminal mastermind who managed to merge most of the gangs in Toronto under her control. She was expanding into the protection market when she was stopped by the Red Panda and sent to jail. Even in prison, she still had influence, as was evidenced by her scheme to discredit the Red Panda in \\"Red Panda: Dead or Alive\\". She later escaped from prison, only to reappear wearing a stolen body gained through dark magic. At last mention, she was one of the criminals captured in the heroic double-cross at the end of \\"The Hidden Door.\\" Voiced by Shannon Arnold (original body) and Monica Cot√© ('Margret Horace' body). *Commander Varkin: European \\"Ghost Ship\\" Captain with ties to a mysterious organization with a \\"great cause\\" and desire to \\"bring justice to the whole world\\". It is suggested in the end of \\"Barton's Charm\\" that this mysterious organization was in fact the malevolent Syndicate in a different guise. Voiced by Gregory Z. Cooke. *Nick Diablos: A master hypnotist and manipulator. He would meet promising individuals in different fields and use his powers to convince them that he was the Devil. He promised that if they would sign a contract in blood, he would use his malevolent might to give them all the power they could grab. Once they agreed, he implanted a post-hypnotic suggestion to make them believe that he was the source of their success, when in fact it was their own abilities that got them where they were. For years he sat in the shadows like a spider on a web, collecting the money, favors, and power from his \\"clients\\". There was one flaw in his plan, however. The post- hypnotic suggestions could not last forever, and after twenty-two years the effects had begun to fade. Suddenly, his \\"clients\\" realized that Diablos and his powers were fake and they stopped paying. He soon struck back at those who had betrayed him, using his hypnotic powers to lock them into a catatonic state where they were haunted by their mind's greatest fears. Despite his incredible hypnotic skill, he was no match for the mind-altering might of the Red Panda and was soon locked in a catatonic nightmare of his own. At last mention he was incarcerated at the Queen Street Lunatic Sanitarium for the Criminally Deranged. Voiced by Gregory Z. Cooke. *Mordriel the Malevolent: A Faustian user of dark magic bound to shadow. He is obsessed with the quest to retrieve the eight fragments of an ancient artifact. Its completion would free him from the ancient agreement that bound him to the shadow in the first place while keeping his powers intact. Temporarily banished to another realm by long-time enemy The Stranger, he later reappeared as Mordoc, a mysterious shopkeeper bearing cursed trinkets, in \\"Barton's Charm\\". It is eventually revealed that he is another supervillain in the employ of the shadowy Syndicate in their grand scheme of dominance. At last mention he had been taken into custody by the Council of Mages. Voiced by Steven Burley. *The Mad Monkey: Insane simian-themed lunatic and self-proclaimed nemesis of the Red Panda. He possesses the limited mental ability to communicate with baboons. His name was originally Anton Creswell. He was a representative for a trading company dealing in Africa when his plane went down, leaving him the only survivor. In the six years before he was rescued he lived with the baboons of the Savannah. Afterwards, he claimed the ability to speak to them. He was quite a hit on the lecture circuit for a while, until other \\"Wild Men\\", like the orphaned English lord who could talk to apes, drew attention away from him. He was quickly forgotten. He then disappeared for years before reappearing as the Mad Monkey. Creswell was originally a sane man, but his powers involved more than just mind-control over the baboons. He can actually hear the thoughts of baboons. He hears them all the time, all their anger, all their rage at captivity. He becomes the nexus of the hive, gives them focus and civilizes them. However, he can never escape the draw of their more...basic instincts. This relentless mental assault rendered him completely insane. Recently, it has been revealed that his powers have grown and he now has the ability to control humans by utilizing the vestiges of the primate brain structure that remains in the recesses of the mind. His character deepens further when it is revealed in the end of \\"The Terrible Two\\" that he is in love with the villainess Jackrabbit. The romance ended when the Monkey cheated on Jackrabbit with Professor Zombie. Voiced by Christopher Mott. *The Genie: A supervillain who is terrorizing Toronto at the end of episode 13, \\"The Hand of Fate\\". It is later mentioned in episode 20, \\"Monkeyshines\\", that he had held Walter Potts captive. He next appeared as a secondary villain in \\"The Red Squirrel\\" when he tried to use an electrical disruptor to pull off a daring heist, only to be interrupted by the appearance of the Puppeteer's killbot. His specialties are centered around his (supposed) great intelligence and his many fantastic devices. One of the defining characteristic of the Genie is his incredible arrogance. As the Red Panda put it, \\"the Genie regards everyone around him as some level of idiot.\\" Voiced by Brian Vaughn. *The Poet: The Pompous Pirate of the Pen, the Poet is a notorious supervillain who commits crimes with a literary theme. To the Poet, crime is almost an art form. All of the clues he sends to the authorities are carefully and beautifully done, be they hand-bound parchments or billboards that border on murals. He once wrote a 140-stanza ode to the contents of the vault at the main branch of the Empire Bank. He printed copies, had them hand bound, and delivered them to every library in the city two hours before he robbed the place. His poetic skill is unrivaled, and he considers himself a modern-day Shakespeare. As the Red Panda put it, \\"He's not far wrong. The sonnets he wrote to taunt the authorities in the Moretti kidnapping are still taught at the University as some of the most perfect examples of the form written in a hundred years.\\" To go along with this Shakespearean theme, the Poet is lover of all things English, and even puts on a bad English accent. To quote the Flying Squirrel, \\"He's an Anglophile, and a complete snob to boot.\\" Though mentioned multiple times, his only actual appearance was as a momentary disruption to the Mad Monkey's plans in \\"The Terrible Two.\\" He was almost immediately recaptured by the Red Panda. Voiced by Michael Booth. *Kid Chaos : Super-foe alluded to at least twice in untold adventures. Prior to episode 12, \\"The Deadliest Game\\", The Red Panda is said to have traveled back in time with a cadre of heroes to stop him from changing history. He makes his first real appearance in \\"The Opening Gambit\\" on the payroll of the sinister Syndicate. It is unknown if he has any superhuman abilities, but he has displayed a fondness for bizarre traps and over-elaborate schemes. His relationship with the Red Panda is possibly a reference to Batman and the Joker. He appeared to have died in the explosion at the end of ‚ÄúThe Opening Gambit‚Äù, but it was noted that Kid Chaos is notoriously difficult to kill and has reappeared four times after being seemingly defeated for good. He returned again in \\"Operation Cold Feet\\" attempting to restart his reign of terror by crashing August Fenwick's wedding, only to be foiled by the Red Squirrel. Voiced by Peter Nicol. *Professor Friedrich von Schlitz: A brilliant German professor and chief scientific officer for the German Reich who may also be heavily involved with preparing new and dangerous weaponry for the growing Nazi war machine. Warnings of his future malevolence were provided to the Red Panda by Baboon McSmoothie. It is left unclear if Von Schlitz would have actually become a villain like his counterpart Von Schlick, leaving the possibility that the theft of his invention in \\"The World Next Door\\" sent him down the path of evil. Von Schlitz was behind a plot to steal the American dirigible \\"Melchior\\", fill it with explosive gas and explode it over the city of Toronto. Von Schlitz also almost killed the Flying Squirrel in the season three finale; she survived thanks to the anti-magic shield provided by Dr. Chronopolis, but at the time, Von Schlitz thought she was dead. In the opening episode of Season Four, an old ally of the Red Panda flew him into the side of a mountain, which appeared to kill him, only for him to be rediscovered by the Red Panda, the Flying Squirrel, and Tom Sunlight in a mysterious other dimension. The Red Panda stranded him there, but it has recently been revealed that he somehow escaped and is once again in Germany. Voiced by M. John Kennedy. *Professor Hex: A brilliant, world-traveling professor of entomology named John Erikson who first appears in \\"The Empty Box\\". He is driven to crime when the University cuts funding to his research and he strikes back with a devilish plan revolving around a small-time crook and mystical promises of vengeance. Voiced by M. John Kennedy. *The Rat Lord: A shadowy figure that played upon the fears of children to blackmail them into committing a multitude of small crimes that added up to a huge fortune. He was stopped by the actions of the Red Panda and the newly empowered Harry Kelly, under his new guise as the Black Cap. Voiced by M. John Kennedy. *The Syndicate: A criminal enterprise dedicated to bringing about a new world order. Their first appearance came in Episode 10, in the form of the paramilitary organization pirating the Great Lakes and led by the foreign Commander Varkin. Along with traditional methods, they have no problem with employing supervillains such as Kid Chaos (\\"The Opening Gambit\\") and Mordriel the Malevolent (\\"Barton's Charm\\") to further their schemes. Their most recent appearance has been in Season Four in which they attempted to turn the people of Toronto against each other. (Ep. 37 - \\"The Third Wave\\".) The full nature of the Syndicate has not yet been revealed, but it is clear that they are very powerful, as evidenced by their ability to find the weakened Mordriel in his exile between dimensions. In more recent episodes, a fascist trend has begun to work into their rhetoric, leading many fans to suspect a Nazi involvement, possibly the beginnings of Archangel. Former Foes *Mrs. Mynack: A seemingly harmless candy- shop owner who appeared almost overnight in ‚ÄúThe Sweet Tooth‚Äù. It is soon revealed that her candies were actually laced with addictive, will-weakening chemicals that turned her customers into willing slaves. Instead of being an innocent shopkeeper, Mynack was actually an ancient alchemist seeking eternal life. It appears that her intentions were originally altruistic, but as she approached her own death, she took desperate measures: she began to steal the life force/soul of young women around her to extend her own life. It is unknown how she accomplished this in centuries past, but in the present she used a great machine that drained the life force from her victims and transferred it to her. She was killed when the Red Panda reversed the machine to return the stolen life. Currently, her dried remains lie with Dr. Chronopolis for further study. Voiced by Lesley Livingston. *Electric Eel: Simon Radford, a brilliant inventor turned supervillain with electrical powers. He had the ability to disrupt electrical devices, stun a man with a touch, and throw a limited number of lightning bolts before he had to recharge. There were two incarnations of the villain, one occurring before the start of the RPA and the other in the episode ‚ÄúDuality.‚Äù Originally, Radford had been held back from reaching his true power by his own fear and his reluctance to kill. The second phase of his villainy actually came after a period of innocence when he underwent hypnotic treatments with Dr. Cornelius Bygot at the Queen St. Lunatic Sanitarium for the Criminally Deranged. Though it appeared that Radford was cured, it is revealed that instead of fixing Radford, Dr. Bygot only succeeded in splitting Radford‚Äôs personality into an innocent half and one containing a completely evil Electric Eel. In this second incarnation, he expanded his powers by adapting the Maximillian Gemstones to allow him to shoot beams of raw energy. He was defeated and thought killed during his bid to absorb the awesome power of the Niagara Falls Hydroelectric Dam when the Flying Squirrel destroyed the controls with a boomerang. He later returned in an attempt to trap The Red Panda at the Queen Street Asylum in Trial by Terror. Voiced by Scott Moyle. *Legion of the Black Hand: Apocalyptic cult. \\"12 men of great learning, of great esteem\\" who sought to subjugate the power of a demon (\\"The Destroyer\\") and paid for it with their lives. *The Destroyer: Summoned by the Legion of the Black Hand, this class- six demonic entity was‚Äîwith some magical assistance‚Äîbanished from the mortal realm by the Flying Squirrel. *Deadly Nightshade: Got away in episode #49 \\"Nightshade\\". Assumed control of Archangel¬¥s network and set up the murder of most of the Home Team personnel in their civilian identities (revealed in \\"From the Ashes\\"). *Captain Clockwork: Creator of numerous robotic machines of destruction, some humanoid - including John Archer/John Doe - and some not. Mentioned several times throughout the series, he was the featured villain of the novel, The Android Assassins. Captain Clockwork was kidnapped by the Nazis and forced to work on robotic planes. He finally appeared within the series in episode 80. Foes Mentioned But Never Seen *Crime Doctor *Dr. Darkness *Lava Lady: Currently serving eight years in Saskatchewan. Unsurprisingly, it has been revealed that she possesses heat powers of some kind. = Other Groups and Persons of Interest = *The Justice Union: An American team of superheroes working primarily out of New York. They operate out of the belief that the mystery men community needs regulations and order, otherwise they are nothing but dangerous vigilantes. Such a belief lends credence to the possibility that they are a government-sponsored, or at least government- sanctioned, team. Despite their focus on teamwork and cooperation, they have a somewhat contentious relationship with the rest of the superhero community. Not all of the reasons for this have been explained, but it is partly due to actions such as the Kirkhouse Resolution against Alternate Superteams. This led to an embarrassing confrontation in which the Society of Gentlemen Adventurers came out of retirement and, as the Red Panda put it, \\"handed you your big silly hats.\\" **List of Known Members ***Molecule Max: He was one of the cadre of heroes who went back in time to prevent Kid Chaos from changing history.

Red Panda Adventures episode 7: Red Panda: Dead or Alive. Podcast. dir. and prod. Decoder Ring Theatre. Toronto, ON. 2006  Original Universe Red Panda Mini-Series  Recorded years earlier, the original Red Panda mini- series was made up of six episodes set during World War II and was the original appearance of the Red Panda character. The name and the character's hypnotic powers are all that remain of the original Red Panda in the current series of podcasts. In episode 24 of The Red Panda Adventures, it was revealed that the world of these stories still exists in an alternate universe from which travel is possible. The original series had a far sillier tone, parodying many tropes of the patriotic superhero radio dramas of the 1940s, right down to product placement and appeals to buy war bonds. The lack of punching/kicking sound effects during fight scenes (mostly composed of enraged grunting and cries of agony) in the series unwittingly adds to the hilarity of these episodes. Dramatis Personae *The Red Panda: Referred to as \\"Canada's One-Man Second Front,\\" he was a superhero in Toronto before World War II broke out, and along with the other \\"mystery men\\" of Canada, he has pledged to use his talents to aid the war effort. From time to time, Red downs a gulp of Manlonite 990 for a temporary boost in strength and speed. *Baboon McSmoothie: \\"The Man of a Thousand Faces\\", McSmoothie is a former international jewel thief and current Australian secret agent. By taking a drug called \\"Adaptrinol T-13\\", he is able to change his features into any form he chooses. This is the same McSmoothie who appears in Episode 24 of the current Red Panda Adventures (see above). *Colonel Sparky Fitzking: Once the pet of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, Colonel Sparky Fitzking is a golden retriever who has undergone intelligence treatments that have given him the ability to talk. These treatments increased his natural canine intellect by a factor of 6000¬≥. He essentially runs the government while the Prime Minister is indisposed. *William Lyon Mackenzie King: The Prime Minister of Canada, \\"Willy\\" was hit with a prototype German insanity ray, reducing his intelligence to that of a five-year-old. The government hides his mental deficiencies in an attempt to convince the Germans the ray doesn't work, by having Colonel Fitzking fulfill the Prime Minister's duties. *The Major: The Major, whose proper name is never given, is the leader of Special Ops and the Panda Division. Her own past is somewhat shady, and she has no compunctions about using any methods at her disposal to get what she wants. She has a known past with Baboon McSmoothie *Dr. Anna Handbasket: A scientist for Panda Division. She is the inventor of many of the tools used by the Red Panda, including Manlonite 990, the Zap Gun and the Ventriloquator. She is romantically connected to the Red Panda and is the daughter of Bucky Handbasket, the Grey Panda. *The Green Panda: Thomas McStrongchin. Formerly the Green Guardian of Winnipeg and a member of the Prairie Patrol, this agent of Panda Division was decommissioned by The Major as a security risk after she tested his discretion through a false romantic relationship with him. *The Grey Panda: Bucky Handbasket. Father to Anna Handbasket and retired agent of Panda Division in the last war. Last seen searching for The Black Panda. *The Black Panda: Victor Boysenberry. Hoping to prove himself to his mentor, the Grey Panda, and the woman he loved, Dr. Anna Handbasket, Victor took an earlier, unstable version of the Manlonite formula that not only enhanced his strength and speed but also horribly disfigured him. Burning him from the inside out with an unending supply of energy, Victor learned he could use the energy as a weapon by projecting it in a simultaneous burst from his eyes, mouth and hands. Wracked with pain and thought dead, Victor fell to despair until eventually joining forces with Professor Von Schlick. Victor ultimately redeemed himself by turning his energy powers on Von Schlick in order to save the Grey Panda and Anna Handbasket. *The Purple Panda: Killed In Action by Professor Von Schlick. *Professor Friedrich Von Schlick: Nazi scientist turned into a living oil slick. *The Flying Squirrel: Kent Baxter, a 15-year-old sidekick of the Red Panda who disappeared under mysterious circumstances. He is not mentioned by name in the original series, only referred to as a \\"teen sidekick\\". His name is revealed in the podcast/original series crossover. *Dorothy Dynamite: Dorothea McCocoa, owner of \\"Dorothea Chocolate International\\", she is a lunatic with a penchant for dynamite and an unrequited love for Benito Mussolini. *Professor Kelp: Owns an underwater grotto visited by the Red Panda. *Dr. Chronopolis: An armored super-villain, not actually appearing in the original six episodes, but referred to in the podcast/original series crossover. *Baron Otto Pilate: Scourge of the Skies and Pride of the Luftwaffe, the original Baron is presumed dead. An army of Nazi android pilots containing his likeness and personality replaced him. *Maurice Baguette of the Resistance: French resistance fighter. *Great Dane: The greatest hero of the Danish resistance, 7 ft 9in, can bench-press a tank, proficient with energy weapons and only speaks Danish. *The Vancouver Vixen: The former pseudonym of an unidentified Panda Division operative. *German Von German: Commander of an elite team of Nazi Ninjas.

In 1801, Homerton defeated Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's Old Ground by 181 runs. Homerton's first important match was in June 1804 when a combined MCC/Homerton XI lost to Hampshire at Lord's by 6 wkts.scorecard Homerton's period of renown ended in 1808 when, despite four given men, the team was well-beaten by MCC in its last important match.scorecard In the same year, Homerton lost twice to an Essex XI in minor matches. The club disappeared from the sources after 1808 and disbanded at some point. It must have lost personnel to military duties in the Napoleonic War which had a disastrous impact on cricket at the time. Homerton Cricket Club was reconstituted in 2012 under Gary Horsman, then president of Chats Palace CC. The reconstitution was agreed at an extraordinary AGM and formalised by a unanimous vote carrying the motion forward.

Life He was born in K√∂nigsberg, the son of James Phillips, an Englishman who had acquired wealth as a merchant in K√∂nigsberg, and of a Scotswoman n√©e Hay. On completing his course at the gymnasium, George studied law at the Universities of Berlin and G√∂ttingen (1822‚Äì24); his principal teachers were von Savigny and Karl Friedrich Eichhorn, and, under the influence of the latter, he devoted himself mainly to the study of Germanic law. After obtaining the degree of Doctor of Law at G√∂ttingen in 1824, he paid a long visit to England. In 1826 he qualified at Berlin as Privatdozent (tutor) for German law, and in 1827 was appointed professor extraordinary in this faculty. In the same year he married Charlotte Housselle, who belonged to a French Protestant family settled in Berlin. Phillips formed a close friendship with his colleague K. E. Jarcke, professor at Berlin since 1825, who had entered the Catholic Church in 1824. Jarcke's influence and his own studies on medieval Germany led to the conversion of Phillips and his wife in 1828 (14 May). Jarcke having moved to Vienna in 1832, Phillips accepted in 1833 a call to Munich as counsel in the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior. In 1834 he was named professor of history, and a few months later professor of law at the University of Munich. He now joined a Catholic circle including Joseph G√∂rres, Johann Adam M√∂hler, Ignaz von D√∂llinger, and Johann Nepomuk von Ringseis. In 1838 he founded with Guido G√∂rres the militant \\"Historischpolitische Bl√§tter\\". In consequence of the Lola Montez affair, in connexion with which Phillips signed, with six other Munich professors, an address of sympathy with the dismissed minister Abel, he was relieved of his chair in 1847. In 1848 he was elected deputy of a M√ºnster district for the National Assembly of Frankfort, at which he upheld Catholic interests. In 1850, after declining a call as professor to W√ºrzburg, he accepted the chair of German law at Innsbruck. Invited to fill the same chair in Vienna in 1851, he moved to the Austrian capital, and remained there until his death. In 1862-7 he accepted a long leave of absence to complete his Kirchenrecht. He always maintained his relations with his friends in Munich and other cities of Germany, and never relaxed as a Catholic activist. He died in Vienna. Works As a writer, his labours lay in the domain of German law, canon law, and their respective histories. At first his activity was directed mainly towards German law his principal contributions on the subject being: *\\"Versuch einer Darstellung des angels√§chsischen Rechtes\\" (G√∂ttingen, 1825); *\\"Englische Reichs- und Rechtsgeschichte\\", of which two volumes (dealing with the period 1066-1189) appeared (Berlin, 1827-8); *\\"Deutsche Geschichte mit besonderer R√ºcksicht auf Religion, Recht und Verfassung\\", of which two volumes alone were issued (Berlin, 1832-4), deals with Merovingian and Carolingian times; *\\"Grunds√§tze des gemeinen deutschen Privatrechts mit Einschluss des Lehnrechts\\" (Berlin, 1838); *\\"Deutsche Reichs- und Rechtsgeschichte\\" (Munich, 1845). After his call to Munich, however, Phillips moved to a treatment of canon law from a strictly Catholic standpoint. In addition to numerous smaller treatises, he published in this domain: *\\"Die Di√∂zesansynode\\" (Freiburg, 1849); *\\"Kirchenrecht\\", his major work, which appeared in seven volumes (Ratisbon, 1845‚Äì72), and was continued by Vering (vol. VIII, i, Ratisbon, 1889). This comprehensive work exercised influence on the study of canon law and its principles. Phillips also published a \\"Lehrbuch des Kirchenrechts\\" (Ratisbon, 1859‚Äì62; 3rd ed. by Moufang, 1881) and \\"Vermischte Schriften\\" (3 vols., Ratisbon, 1856‚Äì60).

It did not achieve statehood until March 1867, two years after the war ended. Nevertheless, Nebraska contributed significantly to the Union war effort. Before the Civil War Territorial Governor Alvin Saunders Antebellum Nebraska Territory was largely rural and unsettled, at the edge of the American frontier. The Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act of 1854 had established the 40th parallel north as the dividing line between the territories of Kansas and Nebraska. It had also repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and allowed settlers in those territories to determine if they would allow slavery within their boundaries. Like the early Kansas settlers, Nebraska residents were commonly migrants from the Northern United States and chose to exclude slavery from their territory. Anti-secession feelings ran strong in the fledgling Nebraska Territory. Seward County was originally called Greene County, after a popular U.S. Army general from Missouri, but after General Greene joined the Confederacy, the county was renamed for William H. Seward, Secretary of State to President Abraham Lincoln.Federal Writers' Project, Nebraska: A Guide to the Cornhusker State (US History Publishers, 1939) p. 363.Cromie p. 176. As the war began in April 1861, Algernon Paddock was serving as the territorial secretary, the highest office. On May 15, Alvin Saunders, a staunch Republican and supporter of President Lincoln, was sworn in as the formal Governor of Nebraska Territory. He served in that capacity throughout the war. Nebraska contributions to the war efforts John M. Thayer, postbellum image No Civil War battles or skirmishes were fought within the territorial borders of Nebraska, nor did Confederate troops attempt to invade the area, but Nebraskans did serve in the Union Army. When the war started, U.S. Regular Army troops were withdrawn from Fort Kearny and Fort Randall to serve in more threatened areas, increasing risk to Nebraska settlers from Indian attacks. The Federal government requested that the Nebraska Territory form one volunteer regiment, with some companies supposed to stay behind to protect the territory. The territorial legislature met in special session in Omaha and agreed to raise the requested local defense force. Thus, the 1st Regiment Nebraska Volunteer Infantry was formed in June and July 1861, with the future governor of Nebraska and the Wyoming Territory, John Milton Thayer, as its first colonel. However, the promise was reneged, and the regiment was sent eastward in August to fight the Confederacy.Cromie p. 173. Serving in the forces under Ulysses S. Grant, the 1st Nebraska Infantry participated in the successful attack on Fort Donelson in Tennessee and then fought at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862. It then participated in several minor engagements in Missouri and Arkansas. In October 1863, the regiment was changed from infantry into cavalry, and was transferred to the frontier to keep the Plains Indians in check. It was mustered out of the Union Army in 1866. First Nebraska Infantry reenactors website Later in the war, some of the soldiers who served at Fort Kearny were former Confederates who had changed their allegiance to the Union, thus becoming \\"galvanized Yankees\\".Cromie p. 175. By the end of the Civil War, more than a third (3,157) of the men of military age in the Nebraska Territory had served in the Union Army. In addition to the 1st Nebraska, the territory raised three other full regiments of cavalry, as well as several battalions of militia. Thirty-five Nebraskans were killed in action during the war, while another 204 died of other causes, including disease and accidents.Nebraska Civil War facts; Johnson's History, pg 150, has 3307 enlisted men Today, several active groups exist in the state of Nebraska that trace their organizational ancestry to Nebraska postbellum veterans groups, including the Grand Army of the Republic, the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, and the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS).MOLLUS -- Nebraska Commandery website See also * List of Nebraska Civil War units Notes References *Johnson's History of Nebraska, Harrison Johnson, Henry Gibson (Omaha, Nebraska, 1880) External links * Civil War Veterans' Museum in Nebraska City * Denver Library -- database for Nebraska Civil War soldiers' records * Nebraska Civil War regiments * First Nebraska Infantry reenactors website American Civil War by state ","title":"Nebraska in the American Civil War"},{"id":"19185139","text":"Serial ATA logo Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO) is an independent, non-profit organization which provides the computing industry with guidance and support for implementing the SATA specification.

But in 1939 the College of Applied Arts was founded with the addition of a Department of Art, followed by the College of Fine Arts in 1960, with degrees available in art, dance, music, and theater arts. Following academic restructuring in the late 1980s, the UC Regents formally approved the establishment of two schools: the School of the Arts and the School of Theater, Film and Television.

The church is located at 110 Notre-Dame Street West, at the corner of Saint Sulpice Street. It is located next to the Saint- Sulpice Seminary and faces the Place d'Armes square. The interior of the church is amongst the most dramatic in the world and regarded as a masterpiece of Gothic Revival architecture. The vaults are coloured deep blue and decorated with golden stars, and the rest of the sanctuary is decorated in blues, azures, reds, purples, silver, and gold. It is filled with hundreds of intricate wooden carvings and several religious statues. Unusual for a church, the stained glass windows along the walls of the sanctuary do not depict biblical scenes, but rather scenes from the religious history of Montreal. It also has a Casavant Fr√®res pipe organ, dated 1891, which comprises four keyboards, 92 stops using electromagnetic action and an adjustable combination system, 7000 individual pipes and a pedal board. Approximately 11 million people visit Notre-Dame Basilica every year, making it one of the most visited monuments in North America. History In 1657, the Roman Catholic Sulpicians arrived in Ville-Marie, now known as Montreal; six years later, the seigneury of the island was vested in them. They ruled until 1840. The parish they founded was dedicated to the Holy Name of Mary, and the parish church of Notre-Dame was built on the site in 1672. Fran√ßois Baillairg√©, an architect, designed the interior decoration and choir 1785‚Äì95; facade and vault decoration, 1818. The church served as the first cathedral of the Diocese of Montreal from 1821 to 1822. Notre-Dame Church, with its replacement being built behind it, 1828. By 1824 the congregation had completely outgrown the church, and James O'Donnell, an Irish-American Anglican from New York City, was commissioned to design the new building, with a goal of accommodating a congregation of up to 10,000. O'Donnell was a proponent of the Gothic Revival architectural movement, and designed the church as such. He intended for a terrace to be built on the exterior of the church, but this was never completed due to a lack of funding. He is the only person buried in the church's crypt. O'Donnell converted to Roman Catholicism on his deathbed and was thus buried in the crypt. The primary construction took place between 1824 and 1829. The cornerstone was laid at Place d'Armes on September 1, 1824. The sanctuary was finished in 1830, and the first tower in 1841, the second in 1843. O'Donnell designed the towers to be traditionally Gothic, and intended for them to be seen from any point in the city. The first tower, also referred to as the West Tower or La Pers√©v√©rance, hosts the bell named Jean-Baptiste, cast in England. The second tower, also referred to as the East Tower or La Temp√©rance, hosts ten bells which are also from England. Following O'Donnell's death, John Ostell, an English-born architect, finished the towers according to O'Donnell's original plans. Upon completion, the church was the largest in North America, and remained so for over fifty years. Samuel Russell Warren constructed a new organ in 1858. The facade of the church was completed in 1865, and included three statues by French sculptor Henri Bourich√©: Saint- Joseph, the Virgin Mary, and Saint Jean-Baptiste. alt= The interior took much longer, and Victor Bourgeau, who also worked on Montreal's Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral, worked on it from 1872 to 1879. Stonemason John Redpath was a major participant in the construction of the Basilica. The sanctuary originally hosted a large canopy, but because it caused a lighting effect that would blind the congregation, the interior designs were reworked by Bourgeau and Victor Rousselot, the current priest. They were inspired by the Saint- Chappelle in Paris, with gold leaf motifs paired with brightly painted columns. Because of the splendour and grand scale of the church, a more intimate chapel, Chapelle du Sacr√©-C≈ìur (Chapel of the Sacred Heart), was built behind it, along with some offices and a sacristy. It was completed in 1888. In 1886, Casavant Fr√®res began constructing a new 32-foot pipe organ at the church, completing it in 1891. It was notably the first organ with adjustable-combination pedals to be operated by electricity. Arson destroyed the Sacr√©-C≈ìur Chapel on December 8, 1978. It was rebuilt with the first two levels reproduced from old drawings and photographs, with modern vaulting and reredos and an immense bronze altarpiece by Quebec sculptor Charles Daudelin. Notre-Dame Church was raised to the status of a minor basilica by Pope John Paul II on April 21, 1982. The Notre-Dame Roman Catholic Church was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1989. On May 31, 2000, the provincial state funeral for former Montreal Canadiens superstar Maurice \\"Rocket\\" Richard was held in front of thousands, both inside and outside the Basilica. On October 3, 2000, Justin Trudeau gave his eulogy just steps from the High Altar during the state funeral of Pierre Trudeau, his father and Canada's 15th prime minister. It was also the setting of Celine Dion's December 17, 1994, wedding to Ren√© Ang√©lil and hosted the funeral service for Ang√©lil on January 22, 2016. In the summer of 2014, a French collector named Pierre-Jean Chalencon displayed a variety of artifacts that belonged to Napoleon Bonaparte. These items included clothing, weapons, and furniture, and were on display in the crypt on the basilica. In April 2019, following the Notre-Dame de Paris fire, Montreal's Notre-Dame announced that it would accept donations to aid in the Paris cathedral's reconstruction. Public access The basilica offers musical programming of choral and organ performances. It is a tradition among many Montrealers to attend the annual performance of Handel's Messiah every Christmas. More than 11 million people visit Notre-Dame every year, one million fewer than Notre-Dame de Paris.

Media and literary career Amotz spent the years of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War in Europe as a national emissary. After the war he worked for a short while as a Paris correspondent for Israeli papers. He then traveled to the United States and went to Hollywood. He made friends with Marlon Brando and Blackie Dammett, Anthony Kiedis's father, and had a small part in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951). In the 1950s Ben-Amotz returned to Israel. He was the star of the radio show \\"Three Men in a Boat\\", a weekly satirical review that became the country's most popular show, and wrote regularly for Israeli newspapers. In 1956 he published A Bag of Fibs with Haim Hefer, a collection of tall stories from the Palmah folklore, which gained cult status. According to the Los Angeles Times, \\"Ben-Amotz was one of the pioneers in the revival of modern Hebrew from a dormant language of prayer and study. He authored a dictionary of Hebrew slang and wrote articles and novels that shocked many Israelis with their frankness.\\" Memorial plaque on Dahn Ben- Amotz house in Jaffa In the 1980s he was diagnosed with liver cancer. When his disease became known to the public, he also brought to light the truth about his personal history. He made a much-publicized trip to Poland that included a tour of Auschwitz. On April 8, 1989, he held a farewell party at the \\"Hamam\\" club in Jaffa, to which he invited 150 acquaintances. The invitees included Amos Keinan (a former rival), Amos Oz, Meir Shalev, Gila Almagor, Yaakov Agmon, Shlomo Artzi, Yosef Lapid, Yehudit Ravitz and Nurit Galron. After the party he made a trip to the US, to say goodbye to his children from his first marriage. He died in 1989 in Jaffa and was survived by two sons and two daughters. His funeral was held on October 22. On January 11, 1992, journalist Amnon Dankner published a biography of Ben-Amotz, in which he argued that Ben- Amotz had incest with his mother when he was thirteen. He also claimed that in his last years, Ben-Amotz had forced himself on underage girls he would pick up in Jaffa. These claims led to a police investigation of some of Ben-Amotz's friends. The book stirred a scandal. Some saw it as exploding the myth of Dan Ben-Amotz, while others saw it as an attempt to gain financially from exploiting Ben-Amotz's legacy by spreading groundless criticism against Ben- Amotz, and many of Ben-Amotz's relatives, who were also Dankner's friends, threatened to file a libel suit against Dankner and broke off contact with him. Published works Parents Meeting (1962) was semi-autobiographical short story about the hardships of the new immigrants in an Israeli boarding school in the Yishuv. The screenplay for the movie Siege (1968), in which he also acted, dealt with the difficulties that a war widow faces in militaristic Israeli society. His novel To Remember, To Forget (1968) revealed some autobiographical motifs ‚Äì the protagonist is a young man who lost his family in the Holocaust and attempted (by changing his name) to re-create himself as a true sabra. In the book, Ben-Amotz tried to confront such questions as his European past and German guilt over the Holocaust. In 1972 he published his dictionary of Hebrew slang, which he co-wrote with Netiva Ben Yehuda. The novel Does Not Give a Damn (1973) told of a soldier who was wounded in battle and his rehabilitation efforts.

In 2014, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) reported a gross domestic product of the marine ecosystem in CT reaches $1.2 trillion per year for over 120 million people. According to the Coral Triangle Knowledge Network, about $3 billion in fisheries exports and another $3 billion in coastal tourism revenues are derived as annual foreign exchange income in the region. The WWF considers the region a top priority for marine conservation, and the organization is addressing the threats it faces through its CT Program,WWF Coral Triangle Program launched in 2007. The center of biodiversity in the Triangle is the Verde Island Passage in the Philippines, while the only coral reef site declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the region is the Tubbataha Reef Natural Park, also in the Philippines. Biodiversity While only covering 1.6% of the planet‚Äôs oceanic area, the region has 76% of all known coral species in the world. As a habitat for 52% of Indo-Pacific reef fishes and 37% of the world's reef fishes, it encompasses the highest diversity of coral reef fishes in the world More than 3,000 species of bony fish distributed in > 90% CT area, including the largest fish - the whale shark, the coelacanth and the chimaerans. The CT is the epicentre for the biodiversity of not only corals and fish, but many other marine organisms as well. Molluscs which found around 950 species and crustacean 458 species, respectively. It also provides habitat to six out of the world's seven marine turtle species. The highest richness areas (6%) were identified along the coast of the Philippines (northern part of Luzon, Sullivan Sea, Bohol, Mindanao, Palawan, and Sulu Archipelago), Malaysia (north-eastern part of Sabah), Indonesia (northern and south-eastern part of Sulawesi, Banda Sea, Mollucas, Raja Ampat Archipelago of Papua), Papua New Guinea (coastal area of Madang, New Britain, Milne Bay, Louisiade Archipelago, and Bougainville Island), and Solomon Islands (Guadalcanal Island and Makira Province).. However, more than half (70%) CT zone were classified as low species richness areas. The greatest extent of mangrove forests in the world also found in CT. The large area and extraordinary range of habitats and environmental conditions have played a major role in maintaining the staggering biodiversity of the Coral Triangle.The Nature Conservancy.

The statement following the Minister of Research and Technology / National Research and Innovation Agency (Menristek / Head of BRIN) of Indonesia, Bambang Permadi Soemantri Brodjonegoro, that research is not only for scientific purposes but also to protect coastal and marine biodiversity from extinction. Theories behind high species diversity of the Coral Triangle The three main models constitute different theories proposed in order to explain the high species diversity of the Coral Triangle (East IndiesTriangle). It usually described as the center of origin, center of overlap and centre of accumulation. * Centre of origin means the highest diversity located in the archipelago is part of the ancestral population then species disperse out from the center toward a peripheral location. * Centre of overlap means high biodiversity was a consequence of overlap of species between different biogeographic regions as a result of population division (vicariance) and subsequent range expansion. * Centre of accumulation means the highest biodiversity (ancestral population) located in the peripheral location then come to build population in the center of diversity.

Competition, predation, fishing practices, marine pollution, marine debris, dredging, sunscreen, climate change, ocean acidification (OA), disease, recreational diving, and other issues briefly described in environmental issues with coral reefs. OA is a really vulnerable threat global threat to the coral reef ecosystem. Based on the biodiversity in the CT area, the damages will come to many sectors, because the coral reef is a fundamental ecosystem in the coastal area. Started from rising levels of atmospheric CO2, the calcium carbonate decrease then enhances bioerosion and dissolution rate. The condition of CT should be in oligotrophic waters, so the light would penetrate induce photosynthesis by zooxanthellae algae. However coral reef in West Maui, Hawaii, has a sustained condition in nutrient-rich, and lower pH submarine groundwater discharging that lowers the pH on seawater. Also, the corals expose to nitrate concentrations which 50 times higher than ambient. Rates of coral calcification are substantially decreased, and rates of bioerosion are orders of magnitude higher than healthy oligotrophic waters. Measurement using heavier coral nitrogen isotope (Œ¥15N) values shows that eutrophication of reef seawater by land‚Äêbased sources of pollution can magnify the effects of OA through nutrient-driven-bioerosion. These conditions could contribute to the collapse of coastal coral reef ecosystems sooner than current projections predict based only on OA. The biodiversity and natural productivity of the CT are under threat from poor marine management (primarily from the coastal development, and overfishing and destructive fishing), lack of political will, poverty, high market demand, and local disregard for rare and threatened species, and climate change (warming, acidifying and rising seas). Coral reefs have experienced mass bleaching, which threaten to degrade the important ecosystems. An estimated 120 million people live within the CT, of which approximately 2.25 million are fishers who depend on healthy seas to make a living. These threats are putting at risk livelihoods, economies, and future market supplies for species such as tuna.http://www.panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/coraltriangle/problems/ WWF - Problems in the Coral Triangle Studies have highlighted the alarming decline of coral cover in this region.Pe√±aflor et al. 2009. Sea-surface temperature and thermal stress in the Coral Triangle over the past two decades. Coral Reefs 28:4. pp 841-850 Since the marine resources are a principal source of income for the population, the downstream effects of losing these critical coastal ecosystems are enormous. Conservation The CT is the subject of high-level conservation efforts by the region's governments, nature conservation organizations such as World Wide Fund for Nature, The Nature Conservancy and Conservation International, and donor agencies such as the Asian Development Bank, the Global Environment Facility and USAID.  Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries, and Food Security  On August 2007, Indonesia's President Yudhoyono proposed a multilateral partnership to \\"safeguard the region‚Äôs marine and coastal biological resources\\" with five other countries geographically located in the CT (Malaysia, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and the Philippines). The multilateral partnership then named as Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security (CTI-CFF). =Goals of CTI-CFF = # Priority seascapes designated and effectively managed # Ecosystem Approach to Management of Fisheries (EAFM) and other marine resources fully applied # Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) established and effectively managed # Climate change adaptation measures achieved # Threatened species status improving =Meeting = The solid-science resources management strength builds with the scientific support of the University and research institute. On 28 February - 1 March 2017, the 1st Meeting of the CTI-CFF University Partnership in Manado was held with aimed at : # agreeing on CTI-CFF University Partnerships conceptual framework and mechanism, and the election of CTI-University Partnership Coordinator; # building-up tangible and collaborative programs and funding support (education, research, and outreach) among Universities and research institutes that can be developed for supporting regional capacity buildings, research needed, and outreach programs related to the CTI-CFF Regional Plan of Action (RPOA) goals as to achieved qualified CTI-CFF outcomes; # identifying possible support and mechanism to strengthening capacity and quality of Regional Secretariat, Technical Working Groups and the National Coordination Committee to undertake their functions. The resulted of this meeting : # the conceptual framework and mechanism of CTI-CFF University Partnerships, # three tangible program/actions, specifically (a). capacity building priority program which establishes international M.Sc. subject on Coral Triangle Ecosystem Governance and special assistance program for Timor-Leste in developing fisheries and marine sciences education; (b). nine research priority programs and nine identified topics; (c). outreach priority actions # University Partnership Coordinator of CT-CFF is Prof. Dr. Grevo Gerung from Sam Ratulangi University, Indonesia for 2017-2020 and the next the 2nd Meeting of the CTI-CFF University Partnership will be held in 2018. Delineation The primary criteria used to delineate the CT were: * High species biodiversity (more than 500 coral species, high biodiversity of reef fishes, foraminifera, fungi corals, and stomatopods) and habitat diversity * On the Oceanography side, The Indonesian Throughflow region (ITF) (input = ‚àí10.7 to ‚àí18.7 Sv;output= ‚àí2.6 Sv to ‚àí9.8 Sv) gives a significant role in the CT area with its function such as regulating the global ocean circulation, the climate system, and the ecosystem sustainability, so the CT region obtain maximum marine biodiversity. Including its complex geography and circulation features, the variability transport of passages, sea surface temperature, and mesoscale variability in the CT should be defined. The seasonal and interannual variability of mixing suggests the CT area influence by ENSO and the Asian‚ÄêAustralian monsoon system *Passage in the CT area such as passage can be defined in ten locations. These are (1) Makassar Strait, (2) Lifamatola Strait, (3) Lombok Strait, (4) Ombai Strait, (5) Timor Passage, (6) Luzon Strait, (7) Karimata Strait, (8) Mindoro Strait, (9) Sibutu Strait, and (10) Torres Strait. The current system on CT is influenced by North Equatorial Current (NEC); North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC); South Equatorial Current (SEC); South Equatorial Countercurrent (SECC); Mindinao Eddy (ME); HE, Halmahera Eddy; and New Guinea Coastal Current (NGCC) There is considerable overlap between the boundaries of the CT that are based primarily on high coral biodiversity (more than 500 species), and the boundaries based on the area of greatest biodiversity for coral reef fishes.The Nature Conservancy. 2004.

It is usually played by two to six players, although theoretically it can be played with up to ten. This game is a shedding-type card game, the purpose being for a player to be the first to discard all of their cards. Jack Change It appears to be the same game as Jacks, Twos and Eights. Basic game Using a standard deck, seven cards are dealt to each player to create their hand. The remaining cards form the \\"deck\\", which players will use to draw their new cards. The top card is turned face up beside the deck to form the \\"pile\\". The object of the game is for one player to be the first to discard their hand entirely by placing a card on top of the pile on each of their turns. Some games allow that more than one card can be played at a time, under specific circumstances. Typically the game ends when one player wins, although some games continue until there is only one player left. The player to the left of the dealer plays first. A player plays a card by placing it on top of the pile, but only if it matches either the Suit or the Rank of the top card. If the player cannot play a card on this turn, then they \\"pick up\\" a card from the deck. When there are no more cards in the deck, the top pile card is removed and placed to the side, and the remaining cards are shuffled to form a new deck, and the game resumes. Several Ranks of cards, most importantly the Jack, have specific effects when they are played. These are normally referred to as \\"trick cards\\". Which Ranks count as trick cards, and their effects, can vary between games and players. Typically a player cannot finish a game using a trick card. Trick cards There are many variations on trick cards, often with different effects and \\"House Rules\\". Below are some of the more common rules, but some games can be played with less cards taking their effects, or more. Some games also may change a cards effect based on its suit, or what it was played on. These rules can vary greatly, and should be agreed upon at the start of the game. There are also differing rules on when a trick card can be played e.g. at any time, or only when it matches the suit or rank of the card on top of the pile. A player cannot start on any of the cards listed below, and a general rule is that a game cannot end on a trick card. There are variations on this, e.g. in the case of a Queen, which can sometimes be used to finish when only two players are participating, or the 5 of Hearts, which may only have a trick card effect if its played on the Ace of Hearts. Some games also allow that if you have a pair of the same rank, you can play both at once. Again, these rules tend to change depending on the players, and should be agreed before the game begins. Ace of Hearts This is regarded as the most powerful card in the game. The next player in the order will have to pick up five cards from the deck at the beginning of their turn. This cannot be blocked by any other card. 2 When a 2 of any Suit is played, the next player in the order has to pick up two cards before they begin their turn. Some games allow that this can be \\"chained\\" by the next player playing another 2, meaning the next player in the order must pick up four cards. This can continue until all the twos are played and a player has to pick up 8. A 2 is the only card that can pass on the obligation to pick up 2. 8 When an 8 of any Suit is played, the next player misses their turn; play passes to the next player. Some games allow that the player only misses their turn if they themselves do not have an 8. If they play an 8, they do this instead of missing their turn. Some games allow that the effect of the 8 cards can carry over e.g. if a player places an 8 on the pile, and the next player places another 8 on the pile to block this, the third player will then miss two turns instead of one. Jack A Jack can be played on its suit of card. When a Jack is played, the player can choose the next suit of card to be played, usually by claiming \\"Jack change it to...\\" This is where the game gets its name. A variation is that a Jack can only be played on a suit that it matches. Another variation is that the Jack can be played on any suit of card, but the change is the one that matches the Jack's own suit. For example a Jack of Hearts could be played on a Spade card, and then the next card must be a Heart. Queen When a Queen of any Suit is played, the order of play is reversed. The player to the right will take the next turn, and play continues in this fashion until another Queen is played. In a two player game, the Queen's effect if usually ignored as the play order cannot be changed. Further Variations The number of starting cards can vary from the normal seven, usually still an odd number such as five or nine. Using five cards allows more players, while nine cards allows two or three players a longer game. As stated above, the end condition of the game can sometimes be different. Usually there is one winner, and the game ends when they have discarded their hand, but some games allow that the game continues until there is only one remaining player. This means there is one loser, rather than one winner. Strategy Players can try to hold on to their trick cards until needed because if they are used early, the opponent can tell if the player has any trick cards to block any moves. This can be risky, however, as most versions of the rules state that the game cannot end on a trick card. Another strategy involves the choice a player makes when claiming \\"Jack change it to...\\". If the player in question has only a few remaining cards, and they've chosen Hearts (as an example), it may then be obvious to the table that this player has mostly (or exclusively) Heart cards remaining in their hand. The other players may then try to sabotage this player by deliberately changing the active suit to something else.

La Princesse is a 15-metre (50-foot) mechanical spider designed and operated by French performance art company La Machine. The spider was showcased in Liverpool, England, as part of the 2008 European Capital of Culture celebrations, travelling around the city between 3-7 September. In 2009, it was on display in Yokohama, Japan, as part of Yokohama's 150th anniversary of its port opening. Arts reviewer Lyn Gardner wrote in The Guardian \\"There were times when it seemed to be leading the entire population of the city on a merry dance, like some kind of arachnid pied piper.\\" Design A performer on a leg of La Princesse in Lord Street, Liverpool The spider was designed by La Machine's Fran√ßois Delarozi√®re, who also designed the mechanical elephant and the giant girl for Royal de Luxe's performance of The Sultan's Elephant which visited London in May 2006. Both projects were brought to the UK by the company and charitable trust Artichoke. The spider was built in Nantes in France, using steel and poplar wood and complex hydraulics, and took an entire year to construct. It was shipped to Merseyside and assembled in a secret location, the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead. It weighs 37 tonnes, has 50 axes of movement and is operated by up to 12 people strapped to its body. When operated, it moves at 2 miles per hour; to move it around the streets requires 16 cranes, six forklift trucks, eight cherry pickers and 250 crew. Performance and narrative alt= The performance artists of La Machine created a story about the spider with one member of the company playing scientist Joseph Browning who gave interviews to the press. The spider was followed by a full live band, housed in their own platforms on top of fortlift trucks and cherry pickers. The musicians played specially composed music by Dominique Malan, the special effects were designed by Thierry Loridant and the costumes were designed by Gaelle Choveau.  First appearance  On Wednesday 3 September the spider appeared for the first time on the side of Concourse House, a derelict tower block in Lime Street, which had been designed by architect Richard Seifert and was scheduled for demolition.  'The journey begins'  On the morning of Friday 5 September, the spider moved to the Albert Dock, and it became active at lunchtime, moving in a small area and spraying the public with water. In the evening the spider travelled from the Albert Dock to the Cunard Building, via Salthouse Dock. A huge crowd turned out despite the heavy rain. The performance move around the Albert Dock and proceeded onto The Strand. The moving cordon of stewards surrounded the spider as it moved through the crowd. The spider sprayed water onto the crowds and interacted with members of the public. It then turned off the Strand and back into the Albert Dock. Here it paused and was lifted from its traction body by a huge crane and into Salthouse Dock, where it was sprayed (along with the crowd) by huge water cannons. After its 'bath' it returned to its traction body and walked along The Strand to its resting place for the night next to the Royal Liver Building.  'City centre rampage'  On Saturday 6 September the spider was due to travel through the streets of Liverpool, 'walking' from the Cunard Building via Water Street, Castle St, Lord St, Parker St and Ranelagh Place back up to Concourse House. At 2:30 pm the Performance started with the spider ‚Äòawakening‚Äô and starting to walk up Water Street towards the city centre. Liverpool was crowded with its usual Saturday afternoon shopping crowd and the tens of thousands who had turned out to see the spider. The spider ‚Äòwalked‚Äô through the middle of the Saturday shopping crowd, up through the city centre's streets, and right into the heart of the city's shopping district. The crowd was dispersed by the moving cordon around the spider. Local media reported that the scene was more representative of a victory parade of a football team or the crowds attracted by the Beatles to the city centre in their heyday. One bride could not get through the crowds to her wedding at the Town Hall and had to be helped through the crowd on foot by the police. The spider's musicians played an impromptu wedding march as they fought through the crowd. Various set pieces took place along the spider's route, involving smoke, fireworks and water cannon. The spider worked its way towards the main shopping area, passing Liverpool One. When the spider reached the centre of Lord Street, it was covered by a snow shower from above to make it go to sleep. It came to a rest at around 5 pm, taking a break before its further exploits that evening.  'The city fights back'  The next chapter of the story continued the same day and involved the city ‚Äòfighting back‚Äô and attempting to halt the path of the invading spider. At 7:30 pm the spider ‚Äòawoke‚Äô and continued to move up the main shopping street, Church Street. When it reached the top of the street it was met by a barrage of flame cannons. These consisted of long copper pipes, fired with high pressure gas. The heat and noise produced by this halted the spider in its tracks, while a mechanical digger moved in to attempt to fell the beast. The spider then changed its path to escape this and moved upwards towards Lime Street. Upon reaching Lime Street the spider was met by huge fans, which blew air to attempted to hold it back. The performance continued onwards towards Lime Street Station and the empty Concourse Tower, where it had first been sighted on Wednesday. A further barrage of flames stopped the spider from moving on any further and it turned towards the station. Cranes then moved in to lift it from its traction body and, with operators still on board, it started to moved into a vertical position. The spider then moved from one crane to another and amazingly attached itself to the side of the tower. A snow shower then engulfed the spider and it went to sleep for the evening.  'The creature departs'  On Sunday 7 September a large crowd of spectators went to the Concourse House to see it climb back down the building. The spider then crawled down the streets of Liverpool city centre, spraying the crowd with water. The spider then moved across St Georges Plateau amongst a huge crowd and down towards the Queensway Tunnel. Fireworks erupted from surrounding buildings as it passed. Watched by tens of thousands of people, it investigated the area outside the Queensway Tunnel's entrance, setting off huge water cannons and flames around the area, followed by hundreds of fireworks which detonated above the spider and the public. The spider then turned to face the crowd and moved backwards as it disappeared in a cloud of smoke into the tunnel entrance. Cost alt= The project, which was free to the public, cost between ¬£1.8 and ¬£1.9 million to stage, of which ¬£1.5 million came from the Liverpool Culture Company (in turn funded by the city, the Arts Council and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport). The cost of the project has been defended by Phil Redmond, who is responsible for the performance as Liverpool Culture Company's artistic director. He said \\"At ¬£1.5m I think it's actually cheaper than (booking) Macca (Sir Paul McCartney) and it has got us on the front of the South China Morning Post. So it's good value for money.\\" However, the project has come in for criticism in some quarters: the UK mental health charity Anxiety has highlighted the potentially traumatic effect of the production upon those suffering with arachnophobia.\\" The vast majority of the public response was positive, however, with most of the belief that \\"The Liverpool Princesse's\\" performance was the highlight of the city's Capital of Culture 2008 celebrations. On 8 September, BBC North West Tonight, a regional news programme, revealed that plans were afoot to secure La Princesse to stay permanently in Liverpool, and talks had already been held with La Machine. Although the event was free to the public, there has been a shortfall of between ¬£300,000 and ¬£400,000 in funding for the project, exacerbated by the falling exchange rate with the Euro, the currency in which the French participants are paid. Artichoke has appealed for donations to help fund the project.

Design An 8 bore is a caliber firearm. Historically it was used to fire solid projectiles from smoothbores, rifles and partially rifled ball and shot guns, as well as shot from muzzle- loading and breech-loading actioned shotguns. Later breech loaders were designed to fire cartridges. History Shot loadings The 8 bore was a popular wildfowling calibre both in muzzleloaders and later cartridge shotguns. 8 bore cartridges were available in multiple lengths including 3-inch, 3¬º-inch, 3¬æ-inch and 4-inch. Solid loadings When the Dutch established the Dutch Cape Colony in the 17th century, they soon discovered their muskets were hopelessly inadequate against local game. Within a century the most popular Boer firearm was a flintlock smoothbore musket of about 8 bore with a 5‚Äì6 foot long barrel. Early British settlers of the Cape Colony in the 18th century also found specialist firearms were required for the local game. British and European gunmakers responded with various long arms from the enormous (although seldom produced) 2 bore down. By the 19th century, the giant 4 bore had been established as the standard elephant gun amongst European settlers and explorers within Africa, whilst the 8 bore was considered the standard for all other dangerous game. Typical 8 bores weighed , and fired a conical bullet at around or an spherical ball at around , both with 10 to 12 drams (17.72 to 21.26 g) of black powder, although sometimes heavier charges of 14 drams (24.82 g) were used, generally in Africa. paradox cartridge In the late 19th century William W Greener conducted the most thorough research of any gunmaker into the requirements for African hunting. After extensive testing and lengthy discussions with returned hunters and adventurers, including Sir Samuel Baker, he concluded the 8 bore was the largest practical calibre required for hunting dangerous game. Additionally, due to the increased felt recoil of rifled weapons, he recommended the 8 bore as the largest calibre for a rifle, and that firearms above 8 bore be smoothbores. Comparison of .577 Black Powder Express, .303 British & 8 bore bullets The most common 8 bore cartridges used paper cases, much like shotgun shells, and true caliber projectiles. A larger version utilising a thin brass case was also available, although it fired projectiles, in reality making it a 7 bore. Modern uses In modern times, this size of shotgun shell has a use in cleaning kilns, by blasting away deposits from a distance. This can be done while the kiln is in operation in some instances. Various loadings are in production for different industrial uses. See also * Gauge (bore diameter) * 6 bore * 10 bore References External links * David E.

The selection of wildlife emphasizes species native to Africa, including giraffes, rhinoceros, cape buffalo, watusi cattle, antelope, cheetahs, zebras, hyenas, primates and numerous species of birds. The park engages in research, education, conservation, and breeding programs that, through exchanges with other zoos and parks, keep the gene pool healthy for the species that are involved in the program. The park is also home to species that are extinct in the wild. The park, one of only six accredited private zoological facilities in the United States, combines wild animal care with vacation lodging. The establishment was started in the early 1970s by Peter Lang on a cattle ranch in Beverly Hills, California owned by his father Otto Lang, the famed ski instructor, film producer and director who worked on the films Sun Valley Serenade, Call Northside 777, 5 Fingers, Love is a Many-Splendored Thing, Search for Paradise, Tora! Tora! Tora!, and the television shows The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Sea Hunt, Flipper, and Daktari. Peter, inspired by his father's work with animals, including Clarence the Cross-Eyed Lion and Judy the Chimp on Daktari, began to keep wild animals on the ranch. After selling the ranch to the City of Beverly Hills in 1989 for use as a city park, Peter Lang moved the operation to its present location on a former sheep ranch near Santa Rosa, California.

The specifications place this caliber between the larger two bore and the lesser six bore. This caliber was the quintessential elephant gun caliber of the black powder safari rifles. The caliber was also used for the Coffman cartridges used for starting large aero engines such as the Rolls-Royce Griffon as used in the later Marks of Supermarine Spitfire.Aircraft Profile No. 246 \\"Supermarine Spitfire (Griffons) Mks.XIV and XVIII\\" By Len Batchelor, Profile Publications, 1966, P. 268. Specifications The name, derived from an old English practice of bore measurements in gun-making which refers to a nominally 4-gauge bore, that is, a bore diameter that would accommodate a pure lead round ball weighing of a pound. This would imply a bore diameter of , however in practice the bore diameter varied greatly as, in muzzle loader days, shotgun gauges were custom made and often differed from the actual bore measurements. Commonly, 4 bores were closer to 0.935‚Äì0.955 inch calibre, which is closer to 5 gauge. History 1750‚Äì1880 Explorer and big game hunter Samuel Baker chased by an elephant. As European settlers found early on, their regular muskets were inadequate against dangerous African game. Early gun adaptations were essentially shotguns with extra long (smoothbore) barrels, firing solid balls. By the mid-19th century, 12, 10, 8 and 4 bore muskets had been strengthened and bulked up for much larger charges. At this time, a hunter of dangerous game would fire, gallop away on horseback to a safe distance, reload, and fire again, repeating this process up to 30 times for an African elephant. The first 4 bores were probably single barrel muzzleloaders converted from British fowling pieces that were, in essence, slug guns. Loads (bullet weights and gunpowder loads) varied greatly. As the weight and strength increased, gunpowder loads went from 8 drams (0.5 oz) of powder to a full ounce (16 drams). The advent of rifling after about 1860 allowed longer conical projectiles to be stabilised, and, aside from accuracy, these provided even greater weight and penetration, with some hardened lead or steel bullets weighing as much as 2000 grains. The 4 bore was also occasionally used for shooting exploding projectiles. Although 4-bore firearms were commonly referred to as \\"rifles\\", smoothbore version of the weapon were actually more popular, and remained so throughout the era of 4-bore usage. Since dangerous game was shot at ranges under 40 yards, a smoothbore was sufficiently accurate, while at the same time providing higher velocities and lower recoil, and needing less cleaning. The prominent British gunmaker W. W. Greener even recommended against rifled firearms above the bore size of eight, with the four bores that he continued producing from then on being exclusively smoothbores. The smoothbore also, at least until the advent of breechloading, could be reloaded faster. Many famous elephant hunters during the 19th century used such weapons, including George P. Sanderson in India and William Finaughty and Frederick Courteney Selous in Southern Africa. Sanderson, in particular, mentioned two four bore firearms that he used, one of which was rifled while the other was not. Although both weapons were of similar weights, the rifle was built to accommodate only one barrel with a powder charge only five-sixths that of the smoothbore, which was a double-barrel. Sanderson, in fact, discarded the rifle after a misfire of the weapon's cartridge almost led to his death, and the instance demonstrated the superiority of the smoothbore over the rifle in the case of an oversized firearm in his day in his mind. With the advent of breechloading cases in the late 19th century the 4 bore came into its current guise, that being the well-known 4‚Äì4.5\\" brass case. The cartridge brass case was around long, and contained three types of loads: light at 12 drams, 14 drams at regular, and 16 drams of powder at heavy load. (Note: 1 dram = 27.34375 grains in the avoirdupois system, since 256 drams = 7000 grains = 1 pound of powder. Shotgun shells are still rated in terms of the same archaic dram measurements, relative to their equivalence of smokeless powder load to a black-powder load weighed in drams.) John \\"Pondoro\\" Taylor mentioned in his book African Rifles and Cartridges that the 12 drams (328 gr., 3/4 oz.) charge would propel the projectile at around . A double barreled rifle that would fire such a calibre would weigh around 22‚Äì24 lb bare, while the single-barreled version would be around 17‚Äì18 lb. In common practice, the cartridge cases were not typically reloaded, as reliability was of the utmost importance, more important than a possible false cost savings from an attempt at reloading that might cost a hunter his life. Bullet lubrication was typically mostly beeswax based, such that in hot tropical climes there could be no possibility of a bullet lube melting from the base of the bullet, ruining the charge of powder within the cartridge. Reliability was the utmost concern.  Golden Age and later usage  This caliber was used heavily by the European hunters, notably so the British and Dutch Boers, in tropical climates of Africa and India. A single barreled smoothbore percussion cap musket of between four and six gauge called a \\"roah\\" was the standard weapon among Boer hunters, until the common acceptance of breechloading rifles among their ranks in the 1850s. Many of the earliest British hunters adopted this practice from the Boers, with Selous being the best known among them. Meant to be used with black powder due to its size, it was unpopular due to the problem of thick smoke and a powerful recoil. Notable hunters that used the rifles included Sir Samuel White Baker and Frederick Selous, who used it consistently in his career as an ivory hunter of African elephants between 1874 and 1876 until the advent of the lighter, more accurate and less cumbersome Nitro Express calibers and cordite propellant. In the mid-1870s, Selous favoured a four bore black powder muzzleloader for killing elephant, a short barreled musket firing a quarter pound bullet with as much as 20 drams (540 grains) of black powder. He could wield it even from horseback. Between 1874 and 1876, he slew exactly seventy-eight elephants with that gun, but eventually there was a double loading incident together with other recoil problems. He finally gave it up, due to it \\"upsetting my nerve\\". Allan Quatermain, having waited until the last minute while holding his elephant gun, orders his men to fire in this illustration by Thure de Thulstrup from Maiwa's Revenge (1888). Although a weapon of immense power, the four bore was far less effective than its Nitro Express successors because of the low penetration of its projectiles and its immense recoil. The huge lead slugs fired by the gun were sometimes capable of stunning a charging African elephant to stop it on its tracks, or turn its charge (causing it to change direction to avoid the hunter) but it was generally unable to kill the creature outright with a frontal brain shot. Chest and broadside shots were effective killers, as was the side shot on brain where the skull is thinner on elephant, however once again this did not help for instantly stopping an enraged elephant charging the hunter. On the other dangerous game species such as the Indian elephant, buffalo species and Rhino it was considered an excellent killer. Henry Morton Stanley carried a 4 bore rolling block single-shot rifle on his expedition to find David Livingstone.  Modern times  The technical data of the caliber \\"4 bore rifle\\" were reissued by C.I.P in 1993. The latest revision of the homologation papers were released by 2002 May, 15.

A common misconception is the hunter Sir Samuel White Baker being attributed to its use, however his firearm 'Baby' as described below was actually close to 3 bore, the firearms records still exist by the maker listing the serial number as 1296. The confusion occurs due to Baker's common reference to the shell fired from the firearm weighing 'half a pound', which would if a round ball equate to a 2 bore by definition. However Baker himself never refers to this projectile being a round ball nor uses the term 2 bore in any of his writings, indicating this half pound shell was a longer projectile of cylindrical or conical shape.

It served the villages of Cross Hills, Cowling, Glusburn, Kildwick and Sutton-in-Craven. History The station was opened in late 1847Binns, p. 8 by the Leeds and Bradford Extension Railway, located between Cononley and Steeton and Silsden. The latter, which is about two miles from both Cross Hills and Kildwick, is now the nearest station to all five villages. The station was originally called Kildwick,Dewick, Map 21 then Kildwick and Cross Hills.Binns, p. 12 The original station was located on a level crossing on the modern-day A6068 just south of its junction with the A629 at Kildwick roundabout on the River Aire. In 1889 the station, which by now had been renamed Kildwick and CrosshillsWignall, p. 791947 Atlas, p. 21Binns, p. 23 and was owned by the Midland Railway, was relocated ¬º mile to the west, by a humpback bridge on the road now known as Station Road. Some former railway buildings have survived in this area, although they have been sold for other uses, but a signal box which stood beside the level crossing was demolished following the resignalling and electrification of the route in 1993-4\\\\. There is a former railway goods yard on the southern side of the track between the bridge and the level crossing and this is now used as a depot for road repairs by the local council. The station was closed on 22 March 1965 and its buildings and platforms subsequently removed, but the line remains in use for freight, express passenger and local passenger trains. It is the main line from Leeds to Carlisle and Morecambe and as part of the electrified Airedale Line it carries commuter services running between Leeds and . Proposals have been put forward on several occasions to re-open the station but none of these have been successful. West Yorkshire Metro listed the former site as having a strong business case in 2014 and ordered further study. However in December 2017, North Yorkshire County Council announced the shelving of plans to reopen the station due to a very low Benefit/Cost Ratio and because a reopened station would mean additional traffic on local roads and would cause the barriers at the adjacent Kildwick level crossing to be in the down position for longer. Accident Kildwick and Cross Hills station was the site of a serious accident in 1875, killing five and injuring 40. Late at night on 28 August, an excursion returning from Morecambe to Leeds was stopped at the station at the request of the signalman who had noticed its rear light was not working. Despite his request, the same signalman allowed an Ingleton-to-Leeds mail train to follow just 4¬Ω minutes behind. The signalman claimed the mail train was let through on a \\"caution\\" signal; the engine driver claimed the signal was \\"all clear\\". Approaching Kildwick station, the driver did not see a stop signal until it was too late, and hit the stationary passenger train at 15 mph. The accident could have been avoided if the \\"timed interval\\" signalling system which was in use at the time had been replaced by the \\"absolute block\\" system that the Midland Railway was already phasing in. Under the old system, trains were allowed to follow within five minutes of each other while under the new system, a section of track had to be completely clear before a train could enter it.Bairstow, p. 61 Notes References *(1948, reprinted 1999), British Railways Atlas 1947, Ian Allan Publishing, Shepperton, *Bairstow, M.

The Nautical Archaeology Program offers admission to students seeking graduate degrees in nautical archaeology. The primary focus is on training archaeologists to become divers, rather than teaching divers the principles of anthropology and archaeology. Students are also required to learn the principles of archaeological conservation, with primary emphasis on the treatment of waterlogged artifacts. Academic Program The program has six full-time faculty members and many research associates who conduct surveys, excavations, conservation and reconstruction of ancient, medieval, and early modern shipwrecks. Each professor holds an endowed fellowship. All NAP students are required to take several core courses: History of Wooden Shipbuilding, Research and Reconstruction of Ships, Conservation of Cultural Resources, and Archaeological Methods and Theory.NAP Class Information The average time to complete a master's degree is three to five years; for a Ph.D. the average is five to seven years.Hamilton, Donny L. 2005.

History of the Program The Nautical Archaeology Program began after the Institute of Nautical Archaeology (INA) became affiliated with Texas A&M; University in 1976. As part of the affiliation, Texas A&M; established the Nautical Archaeology Program as a separate entity. Since the first excavations INA carried out were in the Mediterranean, the main focus was initially on Old World nautical archaeology; after affiliating with the University, a New World archaeologist joined the staff, and work began in North America and Africa.Bass, George F. \\"Introduction: Reclaiming Lost History from Beneath the Seven Seas\\" In Beneath the Seven Seas: Adventures with the Institute of Nautical Archaeology, ed.

The church suffered some embarrassment in September 1866 when the incumbent, Rev. J.T. Brameld, eloped with a young lady called Paulson, and was thought to have emigrated to Australia. On 8 February 1871, a serious gas explosion occurred during a service. Jeremiah Pool, the clerk, was examining the floor at the west end of the church with a wax taper, when the explosion took place. Several people were injured. The pews in the centre aisle of the west end were blown to fragments, and a portion of one of the stone pillars was sent through the roof.

History  The gun was initially adopted by both the Royal Field Artillery and Royal Horse Artillery, and was in full service by 1885. It marked a return to breech-loading guns, after the British Army had reverted to muzzle-loaders in the late 1860s following the failure of the Armstrong screw breech guns. Problems arose when it was used by the Horse Artillery in the great Indian cavalry manoeuvres of 1891. The carriage was found to be too complicated and dust caused the metal surfaces of the axle traversing device to seize.Clarke 2004, page 17-18 It also proved too heavy to manoeuvre for horse artillery, which was intended to support cavalry in battle. The 12-pounder 6 cwt gun was thus developed in 1892, when the new more powerful cordite replaced gunpowder, as a lighter alternative. It had a barrel 18 inches (460 mm) shorter, on a lighter and simpler carriage, and it entered service with the Royal Horse Artillery in 1894. The introduction of Cordite also led to the decision that the 12-pounder was capable of firing a heavier shell up to . A 14-pound shell was adopted and the gun became a \\"15-pounder\\" from 1895.Clarke 2004, page 17-18 At that point the 12-pounder 7 cwt became redundant.

Design The 6 bore is a caliber firearm, used both as a shotgun firing shot and solid projectiles from muzzleloaders and breech loaders, both in smoothbores and rifled longarms. Late breech loaders were designed to fire cartridges. A 6 bore cartridge rifle built by W.W. Greener in 1891 for a southern African trekker called Viljoen, fired bullets at . Three types of ammunition were supplied, hardened lead for elephants and rhinoceros, slightly hardened lead for buffalo and pure lead with a copper tube hollow point for lion. History Early 6 bores tended to be large muzzle loading shotguns that were used for wildfowling, whilst designed to fire shot experiences with dangerous game in Africa and India saw them loaded with solid projectiles, usually propelled by a double charge of black powder. By 1850 the ivory trade was well developed in Africa and India, and muzzle loaded 6 bores were relatively popular, particularly for rifled weapons as opposed to smoothbores. As breech loaders and cartridge rifles came into vogue, the 6 bore's popularity faded in favour of the larger 4 bore, which became something of an industry standard, as it was a very popular choice of caliber for punt guns. By 1880 conventional wisdom was the smaller 8 bore was a more practical caliber for hunting elephant, as rifles could be produced in more practical weights with more manageable recoil than the giant 4 or 6 bores. Despite this, 6 bore cartridge rifles and cartridges could still be purchased. The 6 bore was only made obsolete by the introduction of Nitro Express cartridges in 1898. Prominent users Sir Samuel Baker had a 6 bore made as his first specialist elephant rifle. The percussion rifle, made by made by George Gibbs of Bristol in 1840, weighed and had a barrel with rifling of 2 very deep grooves. This rifle fired a belted spherical bullet or a conical bullet with a charge of 16 drams (28.35 g) of black powder. Baker later wrote of this rifle: :\\"An extraordinary success attended this rifle, which became my colossal companion for many years in wild sports with dangerous game. It will be observed that the powder charge was one-third the weight of the projectile, and not only a tremendous crushing power, but an extraordinary penetration was obtained, never equalled by any rifle that I have since possessed.\\" Cigar, the 19th century hottentot elephant hunter who introduced Frederick Selous to elephant hunting, hunted with an old heavy 6 bore muzzleloader.

The programme was broadcast on RT√â Two every Saturday evening between 19:30 and 21:00 and occasionally on Sunday (when there was an important game played that day) during the English league soccer season, showing highlights of Premier League football matches. When the show was aired on a day other than Saturday, it used the appropriately customised title (e.g. Premier Soccer Sunday). The programme only showed English association football, as Monday Night Soccer covered Irish association football. The most recent theme tune for the show was a cover of the Republica song, \\"Bloke\\". History The programme was first broadcast in September 1998 as The Premiership. Between August 2004 and May 2007, RT√â also had the broadcasting rights to 15 live Premier League matches on Saturday afternoons (kick off: 15:00). These programmes were called Premiership Live. Setanta Sports obtained exclusive rights to the games from the 2007‚Äì08 season. On 18 December 2010, five games were postponed on Saturday and only two games went ahead. So, because there was only two games to show highlights of in one and a half hours. So, due to that they showed extended highlights of both games and talked about the thought of the Premier League having a winter break. On 19 December 2010, a Premier Soccer Sunday special was scheduled because there was two games on that day and one was between Manchester United and Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. However, both of the games were postponed which meant there was no games in the Premier League that day and Premier Soccer Soccer Sunday was cancelled that day. There was a new feature to Premier Soccer Saturday where fans come on the show and give their opinion on the match shown. When the fans came on to the show, they analysed matches and it was nicknamed \\"Fanalysts\\". Due to the length of the fans analysis and extended match highlights the shows were about 2 to 3 hours long when the fans came on the show. On 30 April 2012, there was a special \\"Premier Soccer Monday\\" that showed highlights of the Manchester Derby between the top two teams of that year's Premier League. Man City won 1-0 thanks to a goal by Vincent Kompany which meant that City went on to win the Premier League. Because the game began at 19:45 the highlights show ran from 23:00 to 00:00. They only showed one match during the one hour so there was extended highlights of the match.. In May 2013, RT√â Head of sport Ryle Nugent announced that RT√â Sport would not pay for the rights of Premier League to show highlights. Therefore, Premier Soccer Saturday/Sunday was finished. Presenters The programme was most recently presented on a rotational basis between Peter Collins and Darragh Maloney. Bill O'Herlihy was previously the sole presenter of the program.

Disappearance  On August 21, 1976, Melanie Perkins and Andy met at the pool late in the morning. As usual, they spent the entire day playing there. \\"It was the place to hang out if you lived in the projects,\\" Melanie says. At about 2:00 that afternoon, she was hungry and decided to go home. Usually she walked alone to her mother's apartment, which was less than 200 yards away. But on this day, something she still can't explain made her feel afraid. She asked Andy to accompany her, but he wasn't ready to leave. So her 11-year-old brother, Jeff, walked her home. The last time Melanie saw Andy, he was sitting by the pool in his green bathing trunks, talking with friends. National Guard troops and Green Berets scoured the neighborhood the next day, truckers with CB radios rallied around and neighbors helped with the search. Dogs were brought in to sniff a local city dump and woods adjacent to the pool. Scuba divers dragged the nearby Shawsheen River. More than 2,000 volunteers pitched in. The search was called off after six days. In 1998, while researching for her documentary, Melanie Perkins met with two locals, Alan and Tony, who described finding a rectangular hole dug in the woods near the pool a year or two after Andy's disappearance when the two were children. They describe the hole as being \\"perfectly rectangular, with a flat bottom and flat sides\\" and looking \\"like something had been removed from it -- like a chest, or a crate, or maybe a coffin.\\" The hole was filled in two days later, and neither individual reported the finding until hearing about Perkins' documentary. Perkins added that she had heard rumors a year after Andy's disappearance that the police intended to dig in the area Alan and Tony described to her. Two weeks after Andy's disappearance, Wayne W. Chapman was arrested in Waterloo, New York. In his van police found Polaroid pictures of naked children, maps of wooded areas, a fake police badge and starter pistol, duct tape, 8 mm movies of children, child pornography, high end camera equipment, a bloody child‚Äôs sock and rope. Shortly afterward, Chapman confessed to raping two boys in Puglisi's hometown of Lawrence and, according to one of the victims later interviewed by Melanie Perkins, displayed a familiarity with the area. Despite being considered a prime suspect, police did not have sufficient evidence to arrest Chapman in the Andy Puglisi case.  In media and aftermath  In 2007, a feature-length documentary film, Have You Seen Andy? was made by Melanie Perkins, Andy's friend who later became a filmmaker. It was broadcast on HBO and won the National Emmy for Best Investigative Journalism in 2008. Puglisi's parents divorced in 1975, and his father has since moved to New Hampshire. In 2016, his case was profiled on the podcast The Vanished.

It has been attested as a form of punishment for grave misdeeds since ancient times. Its adoption in some legal systems has caused controversy in recent decades. In ancient Israel, stoning appears to have been the standard method of capital punishment. The Torah and Talmud prescribe stoning as punishment for a number of offenses. Over the centuries, Rabbinic Judaism developed a number of procedural constraints which made these laws practically unenforceable. Its use is attested in the early Christian era, but Jewish courts generally avoided stoning sentences in later times Although stoning is not mentioned in the Quran, classical Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) imposed stoning as a hadd (sharia-prescribed) punishment for certain forms of zina (illicit sexual intercourse) on the basis of hadith (sayings and actions attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad). It also developed a number of procedural requirements which made zina virtually impossible to prove in practice. In recent decades several states have inserted stoning and other hudud (pl. of hadd) punishments into their penal codes under the influence of Islamist movements. In recent times, stoning has been a legal or customary punishment in the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Qatar, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, northern Nigeria, Afghanistan, Brunei, and tribal parts of Pakistan, including northwest Kurram Valley and the northwest Khwezai-Baezai region. Ida Lichter, Muslim Women Reformers: Inspiring Voices Against Oppression, , p. 189 In some of these countries, including Afghanistan and Iraq, where stoning is not legal, it has been carried out extrajudicially by militants, tribal leaders, and others. In some other countries, including Nigeria and Pakistan, although stoning is a legal form of punishment, it has never been legally carried out. Stoning is condemned by human rights organizations and stoning sentences have sparked international controversies.

Religious scripture and law Judaism Numbers 15. James Tissot c.1900 =Torah= The Jewish Torah (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) serves as a common religious reference for Judaism. Stoning is the method of execution mentioned most frequently in the Torah. (Murder is not mentioned as an offense punishable by stoning, but it seems that a member of the victim's family was allowed to kill the murderer; see avenger of blood.) The crimes punishable by stoning were the following: * Touching Mount Sinai while God was giving Moses the Ten Commandments, * An ox that gores someone to death should be stoned, * Breaking Sabbath, ‚Äì36 * Giving one's \\"offspring\\" \\"to Molech\\" -5 * Having a \\"familiar spirit\\" (or being a necromancer) or being a \\"wizard\\", * Attempting to convert people to other faiths, ‚Äì11 * Cursing God, ‚Äì16 * Engaging in idolatry, Deuteronomy 17:2‚Äì7; or seducing others to do so, ‚Äì12 * \\"Rebellion\\" against parents . * Women brides who are not virgins, ‚Äì21 * Sexual intercourse between a man and a woman engaged to another man in a town, since she did not cry out, ; both parties should be stoned to death. * Forced sexual intercourse between a man and a woman engaged to another man in a field, where no one could hear her cries and save her, ; the man should be stoned. *Sexual intercourse between two men, Leviticus 20:13 Describing the stoning of those who entice others to apostates from Judaism, the Torah states: A case noted in the Bible, not falling into any of the above categories, was that of Achan, stoned to death together with his sheep, other livestock and his children for having pillaged valuables from Jericho during Joshua's Conquest of Canaan. =Mishna= The Talmud describes four methods of execution: stoning, pouring molten lead down the throat of the condemned person, beheading, and strangulation (see Capital and corporal punishment in Judaism). The Mishna gives the following list of persons who should be stoned. Sanhedrin Chapter 7, p. 53a , in Hebrew: \\"To the following sinners stoning applies ‚Äì ◊ê◊ú◊ï ◊î◊ü ◊î◊†◊°◊ß◊ú◊ô◊ü *one who has had relations with his mother ‚Äì ◊î◊ë◊ê ◊¢◊ú ◊î◊ê◊ù *with his father's wife ‚Äì ◊ï◊¢◊ú ◊ê◊©◊™ ◊î◊ê◊ë *with his daughter-in-law ‚Äì ◊ï◊¢◊ú ◊î◊õ◊ú◊î *a human male with a human male ‚Äì ◊ï◊¢◊ú ◊î◊ñ◊õ◊ï◊® *or with cattle ‚Äì ◊ï◊¢◊ú ◊î◊ë◊î◊û◊î *and the same is the case with a woman who uncovers herself before cattle ‚Äì ◊ï◊î◊ê◊©◊î ◊î◊û◊ë◊ô◊ê◊î ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊ë◊î◊û◊î *with a blasphemer ‚Äì ◊ï◊î◊û◊í◊ì◊£ *an idolater ‚Äì ◊ï◊î◊¢◊ï◊ë◊ì ◊¢◊ë◊ï◊ì◊™ ◊õ◊ï◊õ◊ë◊ô◊ù *he who sacrifices one of his children to Molech ‚Äì ◊ï◊î◊†◊ï◊™◊ü ◊û◊ñ◊®◊¢◊ï ◊ú◊û◊ï◊ú◊ö *one that occupies himself with familiar spirits ‚Äì ◊ï◊ë◊¢◊ú ◊ê◊ï◊ë *a wizard ‚Äì ◊ï◊ô◊ì◊¢◊ï◊†◊ô *one who violates Sabbath ‚Äì ◊ï◊î◊û◊ó◊ú◊ú ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊©◊ë◊™ *one who curses his father or mother ‚Äì ◊ï◊î◊û◊ß◊ú◊ú ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ï ◊ï◊ê◊û◊ï *one who has assaulted a betrothed damsel ‚Äì ◊ï◊î◊ë◊ê ◊¢◊ú ◊†◊¢◊®◊î ◊î◊û◊ê◊ï◊®◊°◊î *a seducer who has seduced men to worship idols ‚Äì ◊ï◊î◊û◊°◊ô◊™ *and the one who misleads a whole town ‚Äì ◊ï◊î◊û◊ì◊ô◊ó *a witch (male or female) ‚Äì ◊ï◊î◊û◊õ◊©◊£ *a stubborn and rebellious son ‚Äì ◊ï◊ë◊ü ◊°◊ï◊®◊® ◊ï◊û◊ï◊®◊î\\" As God alone was deemed to be the only arbiter in the use of capital punishment, not fallible people, the Sanhedrin made stoning a hypothetical upper limit on the severity of punishment.Jerusalem Talmud (Sanhedrin 41 a) The Punishment of Korah and the Stoning of Moses and Aaron (1480‚Äì1482), by Sandro Botticelli, Sistine Chapel, Rome. Prior to early Christianity, particularly in the Mishnah, doubts were growing in Jewish society about the effectiveness of capital punishment in general (and stoning in particular) in acting as a useful deterrent. Subsequently, its use was dissuaded by the central legislators. The Mishnah states: > A Sanhedrin that puts a man to death once in seven years is called > destructive. Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah says that this extends to a Sanhedrin > that puts a man to death even once in seventy years. Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi > Tarfon say: Had we been in the Sanhedrin none would ever have been put to > death. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel says: they would have multiplied shedders > of blood in Israel.makkot 1:10 March 11, 2008 In the following centuries the leading Jewish sages imposed so many restrictions on the implementation of capital punishment as to make it de facto illegal. The restrictions were to prevent execution of the innocent, and included many conditions for a testimony to be admissible that were difficult to fulfill. Philosopher Moses Maimonides wrote, \\"It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death.\\"Moses Maimonides, Sefer Hamitzvot, Negative Commandment no. 290. He was concerned that the law guard its public perception, to preserve its majesty and retain the people's respect. He saw errors of commission as much more threatening to the integrity of law than errors of omission.Moses Maimonides, The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290, at 269‚Äì71 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967). =Mode of Judgment= In rabbinic law, capital punishment may only be inflicted by the verdict of a regularly constituted court of twenty-three qualified members. There must be the most trustworthy and convincing testimony of at least two qualified eyewitnesses to the crime, who must also depose that the culprit had been forewarned of the criminality and the consequences of his project. The culprit must be a person of legal age and of sound mind, and the crime must be proved to have been committed of the culprit's free will and without the aid of others. On the day the verdict is pronounced, the convict is led forth to execution. The Torah law (Leviticus 19:18) prescribes, \\"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\\"; and the Rabbis maintain that this love must be extended beyond the limits of social intercourse in life, and applied even to the convicted criminal who, \\"though a sinner, is still thy brother\\" (Mak. 3:15; Sanh. 44a): \\"The spirit of love must be manifested by according him a decent death\\" (Sanh. 45a, 52a). Torah law provides (Deut. 24:16), \\"The parents shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the parents; every man shall be put to death for his own sins\\", and rabbinic jurisprudence follows this principle both to the letter and in spirit. A sentence is not attended by confiscation of the convict's goods; the person's possessions descend to their legal heirs. The Talmud limits the use of the death penalty to Jewish criminals who: * (A) while about to do the crime were warned not to commit the crime while in the presence of two witnesses (and only individuals who meet a strict list of standards are considered acceptable witnesses); and * (B) having been warned, committed the crime in front of the same two witnesses. In theory, the Talmudic method of how stoning is to be carried out differs from mob stoning. According to the Jewish oral law, after the Jewish criminal has been determined as guilty before the Great Sanhedrin, the two valid witnesses and the sentenced criminal go to the edge of a two-story building. From there the two witnesses are to push the criminal off the roof of a two-story building. The two-story height is chosen as this height is estimated by the Talmud to effect a quick and painless demise but is not so high that the body will become dismembered. After the criminal has fallen, the two witnesses are to drop a large boulder onto the criminal ‚Äì requiring both of the witnesses to lift the boulder together. If the criminal did not die from the fall or from the crushing of the large boulder, then any people in the surrounding area are to quickly cause him to die by stoning with whatever rocks they can find.

Stoning of the Devil, 2006 Hajj Islamic sharia law is based on the Quran and the hadith as primary sources. =Quran= Stoning is not mentioned as a form of capital punishment in the canonical text of the Quran. However, Islamic scholars have traditionally postulated that there is a Quranic verse (\\"If a man or a women commits adultery, stone them...\\") which was \\"abrogated\\" textually while retaining its legal force. In the extant text of the Quran, the punishment for an unmarried adulterer (Zani) or adultress (Zania) is flogging: =Hadith= Stoning in the Sunnah mainly follows on the Jewish stoning rules of the Torah. A few hadiths refer to Muhammad ordering the stoning of a married Jewish man and a married woman committing an illegal sexual act after consulting the Torah., In a few others, a Bedouin man is lashed, while a Jewish woman is stoned to death, for having sex outside marriage., , Stoning is described as punishment in multiple hadiths.Hadith Muslim 17:4192. Also, see the following: Bukhari 6:60:79, Bukhari 83:37, Muslim 17:4196, Muslim 17:4206, Muslim 17:4209, Ibn Ishaq 970. Shia and Sunni hadith collections differ because scholars from the two traditions differ as to the reliability of the narrators and transmitters and the Imamah. Shi'a sayings related to stoning can be found in Kitab al-Kafi, and Sunni sayings related to stoning can be found in the Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. Islamonline.net Based on these hadiths, in some Muslim countries, married adulterers are sentenced to death, while consensual sex between unmarried people results in 100 lashes. Hadiths describe stoning as punishment under sharia.Nisrine Abiad (2008), Sharia, Muslim States and International Human Rights Treaty Obligations, British Institute of International and Comparative Law, , pp. 24-25OU Kalu (2003), Safiyya and Adamah: Punishing adultery with sharia stones in twenty‚Äêfirst‚Äêcentury Nigeria, African Affairs, 102(408), pp. 389-408KB Khan (2014), Versions and Subversions of Islamic Cultures in the Film The Stoning of Soraya, Journal of Literary Studies, 30(3), pp. 149-167 In others stoning is prescribed as punishment for illegal sex between man and woman, illegal sex by a slave girl, as well as anyone involved in any homosexual relations. In some sunnah, the method of stoning, by first digging a pit and partly burying the person's lower half in it, is described., Z Maghen (2005), Virtues Of The Flesh: Passion and Purity In Early Islamic Jurisprudence, Studies in Islamic Law and Society, Brill Academic, , pp 155 =Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh)= Stoning (Arabic: ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ Rajm, sometimes spelled as Rajam) has been extensively discussed in the texts of early, medieval and modern era Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh).Ismail Poonwala (2004), The Pillars of Islam: Laws pertaining to human intercourse, Oxford University Press, Oxford University Press, pp. 448-457 According to traditional jurisprudence, zina can include adultery (of married parties), fornication (of unmarried parties), prostitution, bestiality, and rape. Classification of homosexual intercourse as zina differs according to legal school. Although stoning for zina is not mentioned in the Quran, all schools of traditional jurisprudence agreed on the basis of hadith that it is to be punished by stoning if the offender is muhsan (adult, free, Muslim, and having been married), with some extending this punishment to certain other cases and milder punishment prescribed in other scenarios. The offenders must have acted of their own free will. According to traditional jurisprudence, zina must be proved by testimony of four eyewitnesses to the actual act of penetration, or a confession repeated four times and not retracted later. The Maliki legal school also allows an unmarried woman's pregnancy to be used as evidence, but the punishment can be averted by a number of legal \\"semblances\\" (shubuhat), such as existence of an invalid marriage contract. These requirements made zina virtually impossible to prove in practice. Rape was traditionally prosecuted under different legal categories which used normal evidentiary rules. Making an accusation of zina without presenting the required eyewitnesses is called qadhf (ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ∞ŸÅ), which is itself a hadd crimeDeLong-Bas, Wahhabi Islam, 2004: 89-90Joseph Schacht, An Introduction to Islamic Law (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973), pp. 178‚Äì181 liable to a punishment of 80 lashes and to be unacceptable as witnesses unless they repent and reform. According to the Islamic concept of Li'an, the testimony of a man who accuses his own wife without any other witnesses may be accepted if he swears by God four times that he is telling the truth with a fifth oath to incur God's condemnation if they be lying. In this case, if his wife counter swears, no punishment will be enforced. Quran 24:6-9, Quote - \\"And for those who launch a charge against their spouses, and have (in support) no evidence but their own‚Äï their solitary evidence (can be received) if they bear witness four times (with an oath) by Allah that they are solemnly telling the truth; And the fifth (oath) (should be) that they solemnly invoke the curse of Allah on themselves if they tell a lie. But it would avert the punishment from the wife, if she bears witness four times (with an oath) by Allah, that (her husband) is telling a lie; And the fifth (oath) should be that she solemnly invokes the wrath of Allah on herself if (her accuser) is telling the truth. \\" One of the widely followed Islamic legal commentaries, Al-Muwatta by Malik ibn Anas, state that contested pregnancy is sufficient proof of adultery and the woman must be stoned to death.Al-Muwatta ;Hanafi Hanafi jurists have held that the accused must be a muhsan at the time of religiously disallowed sex, to be punished by Rajm (stoning). A Muhsan is an adult, free, Muslim who has previously enjoyed legitimate sexual relations in matrimony, regardless of whether the marriage still exists. Muhsan The Oxford Dictionary of Islam (2012) In other words, stoning does not apply to someone who was never married in his or her life (only lashing in public is the mandatory punishment in such cases).Elyse Semerdjian (2008), \\"Off the Straight Path\\": Illicit Sex, Law, and Community in Ottoman Aleppo, Syracuse University Press, , pp. 22-23 For evidence, Hanafi fiqh accepts the following: self-confession, or testimony of four male witnesses (female witness is not acceptable). Hanafi Islamic law literature specifies two types of stoning. One, when the punishment is based on bayyina, or concrete evidence (four male witnesses). In this case the person is bound, a pit dug, the bound person placed and partially buried inside the pit so that he or she may not escape, thereafter the public stoning punishment is executed. A woman sentenced to stoning must be partially buried up to her chest. The first stones are thrown by the witnesses and the accuser, thereafter the Muslim community present, stated Ab≈´ ·∏§anƒ´fa and other Hanafi scholars. In second type of stoning, when the punishment is based on self- confession, the stoning is to be performed without digging a pit or partially burying the person. In this case, the qadi (judge) should throw the first stone before other Muslims join in. Further, if the person flees, the person is allowed to leave. Hanafi scholars specify the stone size to be used for Rajm, to be the size of one's hand. It should not be too large to cause death too quickly, nor too small to extend only pain. Hanafis have traditionally held that the witnesses should throw the first stones in case the conviction was brought about by witnesses, and the qadi must throw the first stones in case the conviction was brought about by a confession.Rudolph Peters, Crime and Punishment in Islamic Law, Cambridge University Press, , pp. 37 ;Shafi'i The Shafii school literature has the same Islamic law analysis as the Hanafi. However, it recommends, that the first stone be thrown by the Imam or his deputy in all cases, followed by the Muslim community witnessing the stoning punishment.Elyse Semerdjian (2008), \\"Off the Straight Path\\": Illicit Sex, Law, and Community in Ottoman Aleppo, Syracuse University Press, , pp. 23-25 ;Hanbali Hanbali jurist Ibn Qudamah states, \\"Muslim jurists are unanimous on the fact that stoning to death is a specified punishment for the married adulterer and adulteress. The punishment is recorded in number of traditions and the practice of Muhammad stands as an authentic source supporting it. This is the view held by all Companions, Successors and other Muslim scholars with the exception of Kharijites.\\" Hanbali Islamic law sentences all forms of consensual but religiously illegal sex as punishable with Rajm.Nisrine Abiad (2008), Sharia, Muslim States and International Human Rights Treaty Obligations, British Institute of International and Comparative Law, , pp. 24-26 ;Maliki Maliki school of jurisprudence (fiqh) holds that stoning is the required punishment for illegal sex by a married or widowed person, as well as for any form of homosexual relations among men. Malik ibn Anas, founded of Maliki fiqh, considered pregnancy in an unmarried woman as a conclusive proof of zina. He also stated that contested pregnancy is also sufficient proof of adultery and any Muslim woman who is pregnant by a man who she is not married to, at the time of getting pregnant, must be stoned to death. Later Maliki Muslim scholars admitted the concept of \\"sleeping embryo\\", where a divorced woman could escape the stoning punishment, if she remained unmarried and became pregnant anytime within five years of her divorce, and it was assumed that she was impregnated by her previous husband but the embryo remained dormant for five years. History Stoning is attested in the Near East since ancient times as a form of capital punishment for grave sins. Stoning was \\"presumably\\" the standard form of capital punishment in ancient Israel. It is attested in the Old Testament as a punishment for blasphemy, idolatry and other crimes, in which the entire community pelted the offender with stones outside a city. The death of Stephen, as reported in the New Testament (Acts 7:58) was also organized in this way. Paul was stoned and left for dead in Lystra (Acts 14:19). Josephus and Eusebius report that Pharisees stoned James, brother of Jesus, after hurling him from the pinnacle of the Temple shortly before the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Historians disagree as to whether Roman authorities allowed Jewish communities to apply capital punishment to those who broke religious laws, or whether these episodes represented a form of lynching. During the Late Antiquity, the tendency of not applying the death penalty at all became predominant in Jewish courts. Where medieval Jewish courts had the power to pass and execute death sentences, they continued to do so for particularly grave offenses, although not necessarily the ones defined by the law, and they generally refrained from use of stoning. Aside from \\"a few rare and isolated\\" instances from the pre-modern era and several recent cases, there is no historical record of stoning for zina being legally carried out in the Islamic world. In the modern era, sharia-based criminal laws have been widely replaced by statutes inspired by European models. However, the Islamic revival of the late 20th century brought along the emergence of Islamist movements calling for full implementation of sharia, including reinstatement of stoning and other hudud punishments. A number of factors have contributed to the rise of these movements, including the failure of authoritarian secular regimes to meet the expectations of their citizens, and a desire of Muslim populations to return to more culturally authentic forms of socio-political organization in the face of a perceived cultural invasion from the West. Supporters of sharia-based legal reforms felt that \\"Western law\\" had its chance to bring development and justice, and hoped that a return to Islamic law would produce better results. They also hoped that introduction of harsh penalties would put an end to crime and social problems. In practice, Islamization campaigns have focused on a few highly visible issues associated with the conservative Muslim identity, particularly women's hijab and the hudud criminal punishments (whipping, stoning and amputation) prescribed for certain crimes. For many Islamists, hudud punishments are at the core of the divine sharia because they are specified by the letter of scripture rather than by human interpreters. Modern Islamists have often rejected, at least in theory, the stringent procedural constraints developed by classical jurists to restrict their application. Several countries, including Iran, Pakistan, Sudan, and some Nigerian states have incorporated hudud rules into their criminal justice systems, which, however, retained fundamental influences of earlier Westernizing reforms. In practice, these changes were largely symbolic, and aside from some cases brought to trial to demonstrate that the new rules were being enforced, hudud punishments tended to fall into disuse, sometimes to be revived depending on the local political climate. The supreme courts of Sudan and Iran have rarely approved verdicts of stoning or amputation, and the supreme courts of Pakistan and Nigeria have never done so. Unlike other countries, where stoning was introduced into state law as part of recent reforms, Saudi Arabia has never adopted a criminal code and Saudi judges still follow traditional Hanbali jurisprudence. Death sentences in Saudi Arabia are pronounced almost exclusively based on the system of judicial sentencing discretion (tazir) rather than sharia-prescribed (hudud) punishments, following the classical principle that hudud penalties should be avoided if possible. Contemporary legal status and use As of September 2010, stoning is a punishment that is included in the laws in some countries including Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Yemen and some predominantly Muslim states in northern Nigeria as punishment for Zina (\\"adultery by married persons\\"). thumbleft500pxA map showing countries where public stoning is a judicial or extrajudicial form of punishment, as of 2013. Afghanistan Stoning is illegal in Afghanistan, but is sometimes carried out by tribal leaders and Taliban insurgents extrajudicially in certain parts of the country. Before the Taliban government, most areas of Afghanistan, aside from the capital, Kabul, were controlled by warlords or tribal leaders. The Afghan legal system depended highly on an individual community's local culture and the political or religious ideology of its leaders. Stoning also occurred in lawless areas, where vigilantes committed the act for political purposes. Once the Taliban took over, it became a form of punishment for certain serious crimes or adultery. After the fall of the Taliban government, the Karzai administration re-enforced the 1976 penal code which made no provision for the use of stoning as a punishment. In 2013, the Ministry of Justice proposed public stoning as punishment for adultery. However, the government had to back down from the proposal after it was leaked and triggered international outcry. While stoning is officially banned in Afghanistan, it has continued to be reported occasionally as a crime. The Hindu, \\"Taliban stones couple to death in northern Afghanistan\\", August 16, 2010, thehindu.com Brunei Beginning on 3 April 2019, any Muslim individuals found guilty of gay sex and adultery will be stoned to death, according to a new penal code announced by Brunei.

On 5 May, the Sultan of Brunei confirmed that the de facto moratorium (a delay or suspension of an activity or a law) on the death penalty will apply to the Sharia Penal Code and committed Brunei to ratifying the United Nations Convention Against Torture (UNCAT).

In 2008, the judiciary tried to eliminate the punishment from the books in legislation submitted to parliament for approval. In 2009, two people were stoned to death in Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan Province as punishment for the crime of adultery. Iran executes two men by stoning BBC News (January 13, 2009) The amended penal code, adopted in 2013, no longer contains explicit language prescribing stoning as punishment for adultery. According to legal experts, while an explicit prescription of stoning as punishment for adultery has been removed from Iran's new penal code, stoning remains a possible form of punishment, since the penal code still lists it, without specifying when it should be used, and allows punishment to be based on fiqh (traditional Islamic jurisprudence), which includes provisions for stoning. In 2013 the spokesman for the Iranian Parliament's Justice Commission confirmed that while the Penal Code no longer prescribes stoning, it remains a valid punishment under sharia, which is enforceable under the Penal Code. ¬´ÿ≥ŸÜ⁄Øÿ≥ÿßÿ±¬ª ÿØÿ± ÿ¥ÿ±ÿπ ÿ≠ÿ∞ŸÅ ÿ¥ÿØŸÜ€å ŸÜ€åÿ≥ÿ™ Persian document; Translation - \\"Muhammad Ali Asfnany spokesman for the Judicial Committee of the Parliament said Rajm is not being listed in the legislation, but the punishment per the law will be practically the same as the rest of the rules are valid in Islamic law.

Depending upon the details of the case, the stoning may be initiated by the judge overseeing the matter or by one of the original witnesses to the adultery. Certain religious procedures may also need to be followed both before and after the implementation of a stoning execution, such as wrapping the person being stoned in traditional burial dress before the procedure. The method of stoning set out in the 2008 code was similar to that in a 1999 version of Iran's penal code. English Translation of Regulatory Code on Sentences of Qisas, Stoning, Crucifixion, Execution, and Flogging Iran Human Rights Documentation Center (2013) Iran revised its penal code in 2013. The new code does not include the above passages, but does include stoning as a hadd punishment. Mohammad Hossein Nayyeri, The Question of \\"Stoning to Death\\" in the New Penal Code of the IRI Iran Human Rights Documentation Center (2014) For example, Book I, Part III, Chapter 5, Article 132 of the new Islamic Penal Code (IPC) of 2013 in the Islamic Republic of Iran states, \\"If a man and a woman commit zina together more than one time, if the death penalty and flogging or stoning and flogging are imposed, only the death penalty or stoning, whichever is applicable, shall be executed\\". Book 2, Part II, Chapter 1, Article 225 of the Iran's IPC released in 2013 states, \\"the hadd punishment for zina of a man and a woman who meet the conditions of ihsan shall be stoning to death\\".

In 2012 at least 14 youths were stoned to death in Baghdad, apparently as part of a Shi'ite militant campaign against Western-style \\"emo\\" fashion. An Iraqi man was stoned to death by IS, in August 2014, in the northern city of Mosul after one Sunni Islamic court sentenced him to die for the crime of adultery. Islamic State militants stone man to death in Iraq: witness Reuters (August 22, 2014) Nigeria Since the sharia legal system was introduced in the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria in 2000, more than a dozen Nigerian Muslims have been sentenced to death by stoning for sexual offences ranging from adultery to homosexuality. However, none of these sentences has actually been carried out. They have either been thrown out on appeal, commuted to prison terms or left unenforced, in part as a result of pressure from human rights groups. Pakistan As part of Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization measures, stoning to death (rajm) at a public place was introduced into law via the 1979 Hudood Ordinances as punishment for adultery (zina) and rape (zina-bil-jabr) when committed by a married person. However, stoning has never been officially utilized since the law came into effect and all judicial executions occur by hanging. The first conviction and sentence of stoning (of Fehmida and Allah-Bakhsh) in September 1981 was overturned under national and international pressure. A conviction for adultery of Safia Bibi, a 13-year-old blind girl who alleged that she was raped by her employer and his son, was reversed and the conviction was set aside on appeal after bitter public criticism. Another conviction for adultery and sentence of stoning (of Shahida Parveen and Muhammad Sarwar) in early 1988 sparked outrage and led to a retrial and acquittal by the Federal Sharia Court. In this case the trial court took the view that notice of divorce by Shahida's former husband, Khushi Muhammad, should have been given to the Chairman of the local council, as stipulated under Section-7(3) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961. This section states that any man who divorces his wife must register it with the Union Council. Otherwise, the court concluded that the divorce stood invalidated and the couple became liable to conviction under the Adultery ordinance. In 2006, the ordinances providing for stoning in the case of adultery or rape were legislatively demoted from overriding status. Extrajudicial stonings in Pakistan have been known to happen in recent times. In March 2013, Pakistani soldier Anwar Din, stationed in Parachinar, was publicly stoned to death for allegedly having a love affair with a girl from a village in the country's north western Kurram Agency. On 11 July 2013, Arifa Bibi, a young mother of two, was sentenced by a tribal court in Dera Ghazi Khan District, in Punjab, to be stoned to death for possessing a cell phone. Members of her family were ordered to execute her sentence and her body was buried in the desert far away from her village. In February 2014, a couple in a remote area of Baluchistan province was stoned to death after being accused of an adulterous relationship. On 27 May 2014, Farzana Parveen, a 25-year-old married woman who was three months pregnant, was killed by being attacked with batons and bricks by nearly 20 members of her family outside the high court of Lahore in front of \\"a crowd of onlookers\\" according to a statement by a police investigator. The assailants, who allegedly included her father and brothers, attacked Farzana and her husband Mohammad Iqbal with batons and bricks. Her father Mohammad Azeem, who was arrested for murder, reportedly called the murder an \\"honor killing\\" and said \\"I killed my daughter as she had insulted all of our family by marrying a man without our consent.\\" The man whose second wife Farzana had become, Iqbal, told a news agency that he had strangled his previous wife in order to marry Farzana, and police said that he had been released for killing his first wife because a \\"compromise\\" had been reached with his family. Saudi Arabia Legal stoning sentences have been reported in Saudi Arabia. There were four cases of execution by stoning reported between 1981 and 1992. Sudan In May 2012, a Sudanese court convicted Intisar Sharif Abdallah of adultery and sentenced her to death; the charges were appealed and dropped two months later. In July 2012, a criminal court in Khartoum, Sudan, sentenced 23-year-old Layla Ibrahim Issa Jumul to death by stoning for adultery. Amnesty International reported that she was denied legal counsel during the trial and was convicted only on the basis of her confession. The organization designated her a prisoner of conscience, \\"held in detention solely for consensual sexual relations\\", and lobbied for her release. In September, Article 126 of the 1991 Sudan Criminal Law, which provided for death by stoning for apostasy, was amended to provide for death by hanging. Somalia In October 2008, a girl, Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, was buried up to her neck at a Somalian football stadium, then stoned to death in front of more than 1,000 people. The stoning occurred after she had allegedly pleaded guilty to adultery in a sharia court in Kismayo, a city that was controlled by Islamist insurgents. According to the insurgents she had stated that she wanted sharia law to apply. However, other sources state that the victim had been crying, had begged for mercy and had to be forced into the hole before being buried up to her neck in the ground. Amnesty International later learned that the girl was in fact 13 years old and had been arrested by al-Shabab militia after she had reported being gang-raped by three men. In September 2014, Somali al Shabaab militants stoned a woman to death, after she was declared guilty of adultery by an informal court. United Arab Emirates Stoning is a legal form of judicial punishment in UAE. In 2006, an expatriate was sentenced to death by stoning for committing adultery. Between 2009 and 2013, several people were sentenced to death by stoning. In May 2014, an Asian housemaid was sentenced to death by stoning in Abu Dhabi. ISIL Several adultery executions by stoning committed by IS have been reported in the autumn of 2014. The Islamic State's magazine, Dabiq, documented the stoning of a woman in Raqqa as a punishment for adultery. In October 2014, IS released a video appearing to show a Syrian man stone his daughter to death for alleged adultery.

Rushdoony, his son Mark and his son-in-law Gary North, supported the reinstatement of the Mosaic law's penal sanctions. Under such a system, the list of civil crimes which carried a death sentence by stoning would include homosexuality, adultery, incest, lying about one's virginity, bestiality, witchcraft, idolatry or apostasy, public blasphemy, false prophesying, kidnapping, rape, and bearing false witness in a capital case. Invitation to a Stoning , Reason.com, Walter Olson, November 1998. Retrieved May 1, 2014. Retrieved 1 May 2014. =Among Muslims= A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2013 found varying support in the global Muslim population for stoning as a punishment for adultery (sex between people where at least one person is married; when both participants are unmarried they get 100 lashes). Highest support for stoning is found in Muslims of the Middle East- North Africa region and South-Asian countries while generally less support is found in Muslims living in the Mediterranean and Central Asian countries. Support is consistently higher in Muslims who want Sharia to be the law of the land than in Muslims who do not want Sharia. Support for stoning in various countries is as follows: South Asia: Pakistan (86% in all Muslims, 89% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Afghanistan (84% in all Muslims, 85% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Bangladesh (54% in all Muslims, 55% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land) Middle East-North Africa: Palestinian territories (81% in all Muslims, 84% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Egypt (80% in all Muslims, 81% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Jordan (65% in all Muslims, 67% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Iraq (57% in all Muslims, 58% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land) Southeast Asia: Malaysia (54% in all Muslims, 60% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Indonesia (42% in all Muslims, 48% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Thailand (44% in all Muslims, 51% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land) Sub-Saharan Africa: Niger (70% in all Muslims), Djibouti (67%), Mali (58%), Senegal (58%), Guinea Bissau (54%), Tanzania (45%), Ghana (42%), DR Congo (39%), Cameroon (36%), Nigeria (33%) Central Asia: Kyrgyzstan (26% in all Muslims, 39% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Tajikistan (25% in all Muslims, 51% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Azerbaijan (16%), Turkey (9% in all Muslims, 29% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land) Southern and Eastern Europe: Russia (13% in all Muslims, 26% in Muslims who say sharia should be the law of the land), Kosovo (9% in all Muslims, 25% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Albania (6% in all Muslims, 25% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Bosnia (6% in all Muslims, 21% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land) Places where substantial numbers of Muslims did not answer the survey's question or are undecided about whether they support stoning for adultery include Malaysia (19% of all Muslims), Kosovo (18%), Iraq (14%), Democratic Republic of the Congo (12%) and Tajikistan (10%). Opposition Stoning has been condemned by several human rights organizations. Some groups, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, oppose all capital punishment, including stoning. Other groups, such as RAWA (Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan), or the International Committee against Stoning (ICAS), oppose stoning per se as an especially cruel practice. Specific sentences of stoning, such as the Amina Lawal case, have often generated international protest. Groups such as Human Rights Watch, while in sympathy with these protests, have raised a concern that the Western focus on stoning as an especially \\"exotic\\" or \\"barbaric\\" act distracts from what they view as the larger problems of capital punishment. They argue that the \\"more fundamental human rights issue in Nigeria is the dysfunctional justice system.\\" In Iran, the Stop Stoning Forever Campaign was formed by various women's rights activists after a man and a woman were stoned to death in Mashhad in May 2006. The campaign's main goal is to legally abolish stoning as a form of punishment for adultery in Iran. Human rights Stoning is condemned by human rights groups as a form of cruel and unusual punishment and torture, and a serious violation of human rights. Women's rights Stoning has been condemned as a violation of women's rights and a form of discrimination against women. Although stoning is also applied to men, the vast majority of the victims are reported to be women. According to the international group Women Living Under Muslim Laws stoning \\"is one of the most brutal forms of violence perpetrated against women in order to control and punish their sexuality and basic freedoms\\". Amnesty International has argued that the reasons for which women suffer disproportionately from stoning include the fact that women are not treated equally and fairly by the courts; the fact that, being more likely to be illiterate than men, women are more likely to sign confessions to crimes which they did not commit; and the fact that general discrimination against women in other life aspects leaves them at higher risk of convictions for adultery. LGBT rights Stoning also targets homosexuals and others who have same-sex relations in certain jurisdictions. In Mauritania, northern Nigeria, Somalia, Brunei, and Yemen, the legal punishment for sodomy is death by stoning. Right to private life Human rights organizations argue that many acts targeted by stoning should not be illegal in the first place, as outlawing them interferes with people's right to a private life. Amnesty International said that stoning deals with \\"acts which should never be criminalized in the first place, including consensual sexual relations between adults, and choosing one‚Äôs religion\\".

The public was not invited to the stoning, and the incident was not reported to the media. However it was spread by word of mouth to a journalist and women's rights activist. The activist gathered information and further exposed the happening to the world. In response to this, several women's rights activists, lawyers and members of the Networks of Volunteers went on to form the Stop Stoning Forever campaign to stop stoning in Iran. * Du‚Äôa Khalil Aswad, 2007, a 17-year-old stoned to death in Iraq * Solange Medina, 2009, a 20-year-old stoned to death in Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua, Mexico * Gustavo Santoro, 2010, a small town mayor in Mexico believed to have been murdered by stoning * Murray Seidman, 2011, a 70-year-old senior in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia, stoned to death by 28-year-old John Thomas after allegedly making sexual advances towards the younger man.

In her book Political Theory and the Displacement of Politics (Cornell, 1993, awarded the 1994 Foundations of Political Thought Book Prize for best first book in political theoryAmerican Political Science Association), she develops this notion through critiques of consensual conceptions of democracy. Arguing that every political settlement engenders remainders to which it cannot fully do justice, she draws on Nietzsche and Arendt, among others, to bring out the emancipatory potential of political contestation and of the disruption of settled practices. Recognizing, on the other hand, that politics involves the imposition of order and stability, she argues that politics can neither be reduced to consensus, nor to pure contestation, but that these are both essential aspects of politics. Her second book, Democracy and the Foreigner (Princeton University Press, 2001), aims to illuminate the underestimated role of foreignness in democratic politics, particularly in the (re)founding of democratic communities. In doing so, she aims to shift the question from how to deal with foreigners to ‚ÄúWhat problems does foreignness solve for us?‚Äù This strategy of subverting binary oppositions (such as contestation vs. consensus, foreignness vs. familiarity, decision vs. deliberation, and in her third book Emergency Politics: Paradox, Law and Democracy (Princeton University Press, 2009), normality vs. exception) by shifting the question of a well-known debate in order to obtain a new and revealing perspective, recurs throughout her work and the insights that result constitute her distinctive contributions to political theory. In Antigone, Interrupted (Cambridge University Press, 2013), Honig intervenes in the recent turn to mourning and lamentation in political theory and cultural studies. By way of a rereading of Sophocles' tragedy, she counters the privileging of mortality and vulnerability as part of an anti- sovereign politics. Instead, Honig offers an ‚Äúagonistic humanism‚Äù that stresses equality in life, not death, and an activist politics of counter- sovereignty. Personal life Honig is married to MIT economist Michael Whinston. Her son Noah is the CEO of eSports gaming franchise Immortals.  Selected bibliography   Books   * Honig, Bonnie (2017).

Life Jura Anglorum (1792). Francis Plowden, born in Shropshire on 8 June 1749, was the eighth son of William Ignatius Plowden of Plowden Hall. He was educated at St. Omer's College and entered the Jesuit novitiate at Watten in 1766. When the Society was suppressed, he was teaching at the College at Bruges. Not being in holy orders he was, by the terms of suppression, relieved of his first vows, and soon afterwards married Dorothea, daughter of George J. Griffith Phillips, esq., of Curaegwillinag, Carmarthenshire. \\"Curaegwillinag\\" is an anglicisation of the Welsh placename for an old commote located in Carmarthenshire. Kymwt Carnywyllawn was in Cantref Eginawc (anglicized as \\"Eginog\\"), which was in Ystrad Tywi. He entered the Middle Temple and practiced as a conveyancer, the only department of the legal profession open to Catholics under the Penal Laws. After the relief Act of 1791 he was called to the Bar. His first major work, Jura Anglorum, appeared in 1792, a conservative formulation of natural rights and contract theory.Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Political Thought, ed. Goldie & Wokler, 2006, p. 766 It was attacked in a pamphlet by his brother Robert Plowden, a priest under the title of \\"A Roman Catholic Clergyman\\". The book was so highly thought of that the University of Oxford presented him with the honorary degree of D.C.L., a unique distinction for a Catholic of those days. His improvidence, extreme views, and intractable disposition made his life a troubled one. Having fallen out with the Lord Chancellor, he ceased to practice at the bar and devoted himself to writing. While in Dublin (1811) he published his work \\"Ireland since the Union\\" which led to a prosecution on the part of the Government for libel, resulting in a verdict of ¬£5000 damages. Plowden considered that this was rewarded by a packed jury and determined not to pay it. He escaped to Paris where he spent the remaining years of his life in comparative poverty as a professor at the Scots College, dying on 4 January 1829, aged 79. Family The comic play, Virginia, by his wife Dorothea was condemned following its premier performance. Their eldest daughter, Anna Maria, became the third countess of Archibald, ninth earl of Dundonald. Works Plowden's Historical Review of the State of Ireland (1803) was written at the request of the Government, but it was too outspoken a condemnation to meet their views, and was attacked by Richard Musgrave in the Historical Review and also by the British Critic. Plowden answered by a Posthumous Preface giving an account of his communications with Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth, and also by a Historical Letter to Sir Richard Musgrave. His Historical Letters to Sir John Coxe Hippisley (1815) contained matter connected with the question of Catholic emancipation. His other works are: *The Case Stated (Cath.

The aim of the international project OSAMI is the design of a basic, widely applicable SOA-oriented component platform, its development, test and its provision as open source software. The project consists of a number of national subprojects, each focussing on a certain field of application. The German subproject OSAMI-D, funded by the BMBF, the German ministry of education and research, under reference number 01 IS 08003, contributes to the e-Health domain. The main objectives are interoperability, maintainability, reliability, as well as automated configuration and management of medical devices and services to provide new forms of healthcare to diseased and convalescent people. The advantages of these technical contributions will be demonstrated by means of an e-Health application which supports ambulant cardiologic rehabilitation. The software component platform specified by the OSGi Alliance forms the technical basis of the OSAMI platform. It provides lifecycle management for software components as well as local service interactions as defined in service-oriented architectures and will be combined with the Web Services approach, in particular DPWS / WS4D in order to implement distributed, dynamically configurable, vendor-neutral and device-independent solutions. ;Project data :Support programme: BMBF IKT2020 :Duration: 01.07.2008 - 31.12.2011 General information The main objective of OSAMI is to connect technologically vertical markets on the basis of open source components and, hence, to facilitate the market entry for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME).

The intra-domain \\"horizontal\\" architecture design and the actual software implementation take place in WP 5. *WP 5: OSAMI Interface & Architecture WP 5 concentrates on defining the intra-domain OSAMI architecture considering SOA-principles for distributed, device-based systems and their realization under the Open Source licence model. The architecture is the basis of the implementation of components for the healthcare domain specified in WP 4. Complementary proprietary components and the policy-based management system are produced (ref. e.g. WS-Policy). *WP 6: Security, Assets and User interface issues Data security, easy integration and management of the external components as well as multimodal and plainly defined user interfaces are important for the acceptance and wide applicability of OSAMI applications. These features set the stage for processing sensitive data and reduce the barriers for deployment. The German subproject focuses on the data security for e-Health applications. These applications handle with sensitive, personal data and thus must be reliable. Therefore, there are distinct data security requirements, which are to be considered representatively for the requirements for the more sophisticated general applications. *WP 7: Demonstrators In WP 7 the components of the e-Health demonstrator on the basis of the OSAMI architecture and the results of WPs 4 - 6 are to be integrated. The integrated hard- and software components are to be well tried and proven in a realistic scenario. The evaluation covers the acceptance of the new technologies by end users in addition to the technical requirements. The development and the validation of the demonstrator occur in three successive phases. The first phase is intended for the implementation of a so- called \\"mock-up\\" with an initial design of the user interface and primary implementation of the corresponding hardware and software components. These form among others the basis for the following phases of the overall project's work plan.

Gay pornography is the representation of sexual activity between males. Its primary goal is sexual arousal in its audience. Softcore gay pornography also exists; it at one time constituted the genre, and may be produced as beefcake pornography for heterosexual female and homosexual male consumption.e.g. DNA (magazine), Blueboy (magazine) Homoerotic art and artifacts have a long history, reaching back to Greek antiquity. Every medium has been used to represent sexual acts between men. However, gay pornography in contemporary mass media is mostly concentrated in the making of home videos (including DVDs), cable broadcast and emerging video on demand and wireless markets, as well as images and movies for viewing on the Internet. (For printed gay erotica, see gay pulp fiction). History The Swimming Hole (1884‚Äì85) by the American artist Thomas Eakins (1844‚Äì1916) is regarded as a masterpiece of American painting,Bolger, Doreen; Cash, Sarah; et al. Thomas Eakins and the Swimming Picture. Amon Carter Museum, 1996. and has been called \\"the most finely designed of all his outdoor pictures\\".Goodrich, Lloyd. Thomas Eakins, Volume I. Harvard University Press, 1982. pp 239. . The painting has been \\"widely cited as a prime example of homoeroticism in American art\\". Eakins himself appears in the water at bottom right ‚Äì \\"in signature position, so to speak.\\" According to Jonathan Weinberg, The Swimming Hole marked the beginning of homoerotic imagery in American art.Adams, Henry. Eakins Revealed: The Secret Life of an American Artist. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. , 308‚Äì09. Referenced from Male Desire: The Homoerotic in American Art by Jonathan Weinberg Early modern in the United States Homoeroticism has been present in photography and film since their invention. During much of that time, any sexual depiction had to remain underground because of obscenity laws. In particular, gay material might constitute evidence of an illegal act under sodomy laws in many jurisdictions. This is no longer the case in the United States, since such laws were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2003 in Lawrence v. Texas. However, hardcore pornographic motion pictures (stag films, as they were called prior to their legalization in 1970) were produced relatively early in the history of film. The first known pornographic film appears to have been made in Europe in 1908. The earliest known film to depict hardcore gay (and bisexual) sexual activity was the French film Le m√©nage moderne du Madame Butterfly, produced and released in 1920. Most historians consider the first American stag film to be A Free Ride, produced and released in 1915.Knight, Arthur, and Alpert, Hollis. \\"The Stag Film.\\" Playboy. November 1967.Di Lauro, Al and Rabkin, Gerald. Dirty Movies: An Illustrated History of the Stag Film, 1915‚Äì1970. New York: Value Proprietary, 1988. In the United States, however, hardcore gay sexual activity did not make it onto film until 1929's The Surprise of a Knight.Burger, John R.

Slade, Joseph. \\"Bernard Natan: France's Legendary Pornographer.\\" Journal of Film and Video. 45:2‚Äì3 (Summer-Fall 1993). Legal restrictions meant that early hardcore gay pornography was underground and that commercially available gay pornography primarily consisted of pictures of individual men either fully naked or wearing a G-string. Pornography in the 1940s and 1950s focused on athletic men or bodybuilders in statuesque poses. They were generally young, muscular, and with little or no visible body hair. These pictures were sold in physique magazines, also known as beefcake magazines, allowing the reader to pass as a fitness enthusiast. The Athletic Model Guild (AMG), founded by photographer Bob Mizer in 1945 in Los Angeles, was arguably the first studio to commercially produce material specifically for gay men and published the first magazine known as Physique Pictorial in 1951. Tom of Finland drawings are featured in many issues.Ramakers, Mischa. Dirty Pictures: Tom of Finland, Masculinity and Homosexuality. New York: Saint Martin's Press, 2001. Mizer produced about a million images, and thousands of films and videos before he died on May 12, 1992. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the advent of 16 mm film cameras enabled these photographers to produce underground movies of gay sex, male masturbation, or both. Sales of these products were either by mail-order or through more discreet channels. Some of the early gay pornographers would travel around the country selling their photographs and films out of their hotel rooms, with advertising only through word of mouth and magazine ads. The 1960s were also a period where many underground art-film makers integrated suggestive or overtly gay content in their work. Kenneth Anger's Scorpio Rising (1963), Andy Warhol's Blow Job (1963) and My Hustler (1965), or Paul Morrissey's Flesh (1968) are examples of experimental films that are known to have influenced further gay pornographic films with their formal qualities and narratives. Also of note is Joe Dallesandro, who acted in hardcore gay pornographic films in his early 20s, posed nude for Francesco Scavullo, Bruce of L.A. and Bob Mizer, and later acted for Warhol in films such as Flesh. Dallesandro was well-known to the public. In 1969 Time called him one of the most beautiful people of the 1960s, and he appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine in April 1971. Dallesandro also appeared on the cover of The Smiths' eponymous debut album, The Smiths. Sexual revolution During the 1960s, a series of United States Supreme Court rulings created a more liberalized legal environment that allowed the commercialization of pornography. MANual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day. was the first decision by the United States Supreme Court which held that magazines consisting largely of photographs of nude or near-nude male models are not obscene within the meaning of ¬ß 1461. It was the first case in which the Court engaged in plenary review of a Post Office Department order holding obscene matter \\"nonmailable.\\"370 U.S. at 495‚Äì496. The case is notable for its ruling that photographs of nude men are not obscene, an implication which opened up the U.S. Postal Service to nude male pornographic magazines, especially those catering to gay men. Wakefield Poole's Boys in the Sand, starring Casey Donovan, was the first gay pornographic feature film, along with the works of filmmakers such as Pat Rocco and the Park Theatre, Los Angeles, California, circa 1970. In fact, it was the first pornographic feature film of any sort. Boys in the Sand opened in a theater in New York City in December 1971 and played to a packed house with record-breaking box office receipts, preceding Deep Throat, the first commercial straight pornography film in America, which opened in June 1972. This success launched gay pornographic film as a popular phenomenon. The production of gay pornography films expanded during the 1970s. A few studios released films for the growing number of gay adult movie theatres, where men could also have sexual encounters. Often, the films reflected the sexual liberation that gay men were experiencing at the time, depicting the numerous public spaces where men engaged in sex: bathhouses, sex clubs, beaches, etc. Peter Berlin's 1973 film Nights in Black Leather was the first major pornographic film designed to appeal to the gay leather subculture and drew some mainstream gays into this culture. The 1960s and 1970s also saw the rise of gay publishing with After Dark and Michael's Thing. During this time many more magazines were founded, including In Touch and Blueboy. Playgirl, ostensibly produced for women, was purchased and enjoyed by gay men and feature full frontal nudity (the posing straps and fig leaves were removed). Gay pornography of the 1950s through the production date of the movie is reviewed, with many excerpts, in Fred Halsted's documentary Erotikus: A History of the Gay Movie (1974).  1970‚Äì1985  From 1970‚Äì1985, commercial gay pornography was just getting set up to become the large industry that it is today. Because it was in the fledgling stage, it recruited actors from the only network it had access to: the gay community. Even among members of the gay community, people willing to act in gay porn were hard to come by due to the social stigma and implicated social risk of being publicly out. 1980s The 1980s were a period of transition for gay pornography film. The proliferation of VCRs made pornography videos easily accessible, and, as their prices fell, the market for home videos aimed at adult viewers became more and more lucrative. By the mid-1980s, the standard was to release pornography movies directly on video, which meant the wide disappearance of pornography theaters. Furthermore, video recording being more affordable, a multitude of producers entered the market, making low-budget pornography videos. This shift from watching pornography as a public activity to doing so in private was also influenced by the discovery of HIV and the subsequent AIDS crisis. Public spaces for sex, such as theatres, became less attended when in the early 1980s it became a much riskier behavior. Masturbatory activities in the privacy of the home became a safe sex practice in the midst of this health crisis. Gay movies of the 1970s had contained some exploration of novel ways to represent the sexual act. In the 1980s, by contrast, all movies seemed to be made under an unwritten set of rules and conventions. Most scenes would start with a few lines of dialogue, have performers engage in foreplay (fellatio), followed by anal penetration, and ending with a visual climax close-up of ejaculating penises, called a money shot or cum shot. Video technology allowed the recording of longer scenes than did the costly film stock. Scenes were often composed of extended footage of the same act filmed from different shots using multiple cameras. The quality of the picture and sound were often very poor. Major directors such as Matt Sterling, Eric Peterson, John Travis, and William Higgins set the standard for the models of the decade. The performers they cast were especially young, usually appearing to be around the ages of 22 or 23. Their bodies were slender and hairless, of the \\"swimmer's build\\" type, which contrasted with the older, bigger, and hairier man of the 1970s' gay pornography. Performer roles also evolved into the tight divisions of tops and bottoms. The top in anal sex is the penetrating partner, who, in these films, typically has a more muscular body and the larger penis. The bottom, or receiver of anal sex, in the films is often smaller and sometimes more effeminate. The stars of the decade were almost always tops, while the bottoms were interchangeable (with the exception of Joey Stefano, a popular star, who was more of a bottom.) This strict division between tops and bottoms may have reflected a preference by some of the popular directors of the decade to hire heterosexual men for their movies. Heterosexual men who perform gay sex for monetary reasons (commonly labeled gay-for-pay) were considered a rare commodity in the gay sex trade, but the biggest producers of the decade could afford them. Many critics attributed the conventionalization of gay pornography of the 1980s to this trend.  After 1985  1985 was a pivotal year for gay porn because by then, the market had grown enough to make it a desirable field of work for not only gay men but also straight men. According to one estimate by porn director Chi Chi Larue, 60% of the actors in gay porn are actually straight. This incidence of straight men in gay porn is known as gay-for-pay and the ethics behind it and implications of it are highly disputed. 1990s A fluffer on set of a gay pornographic movie. Fluffers help actors get and keep an erection for their scene. As the gay pornography industry has grown, so have unique jobs related to the production and distribution. The gay pornography industry diversified steadily during the 1990s. In 1989, director Kristen Bjorn started a pornographic business which was considered as setting a standard for gay pornography producers. He was a professional photographer, and the images in his videos were considered to be of high-quality. As a former porn star himself, he directed his models with care, which helped improved the actors' believability. Other directors had to improve their technical quality to keep up with demands from their audiences. Another significant change during this decade was the explosion of the niche market. Many videos began to be produced for viewers with specific tastes (i.e. for amateur pornography, military (men in uniform) pornography, transgender performers, bondage fetishes, performers belonging to specific ethnic groups, etc.), and this led to a diversification of the people involved in pornography production and consumption. The gay pornography industry grew substantially in popularity during the 1990s, evolving into a complex and interactive subculture. Professional directors (such as Chi Chi LaRue and John Rutherford), technicians or deck operators during the U-matic phase of video technology, and performers started to engage in pornography as a career, their work sustained by emerging pornographic media and influential critics, such as Mikey Skee. 21st century Vietnamese American gay pornographic actor, film director, and photographer Van Darkholme is among the few Asian American men working in Western gay porn as a director and actor.BN Magazine feature (vietnamese American magazine) Photo taken during the 2010 Blatino Erotica Awards. In the 21st century, gay pornography has become a highly profitable enterprise, ranging from the \\"straight-guy\\" pornography of Active Duty and Sean Cody, to the 'twinks' of BelAmi. Many niche genres and online delivery sites cater to various and changing interests. For instance much of Van Darkholme's work contains bondage and particularly shibari, the Japanese art of bondage and knot-tying, a specialty within BDSM cultures. On the other hand, Lucas Kazan Productions successfully adapted literary classics: Decameron: Two Naughty Tales is based on two novels by Boccaccio, The Innkeeper on Goldoni's La Locandiera. Lucas Kazan also found inspiration in 19th and 20th century operas, combining gay porn and melodrama: The School for Lovers, 2007 GayVN Award Winner for Best Foreign Picture, is in fact inspired by Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte. Some controversy currently exists regarding studios that produce bareback videos (videos of sexual penetration by the penis without a condom). Mainstream companies, such as Falcon Entertainment, Hot House Entertainment, Channel 1 Releasing, Lucas Entertainment, Raging Stallion Studios, Lucas Kazan Productions and Titan Media and LGBT health advocates assert that condomless videos promote unsafe sex and contribute to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, both in the pornography industry and in the gay community as a whole. The controversy dates back to the first few years of the HIV crisis, when nearly all gay pornography production companies voluntarily required their models to wear condoms for anal sex. The premise of industry figures, notably Chi Chi LaRue, is that gay pornography serves as a leading forum for teaching safer sex skills and modelling healthy sexual behaviors. At least one bareback studio agrees that porn should promote healthy sexual behaviors, but disagrees on the definition of healthy in this context: speaking about the AIDS crisis, Treasure Island Media owner and founder Paul Morris has expressed his belief that, \\"To a great extent, the current gay mindset surrounding HIV is a result of a generation of men living with PTSD and not getting the support and help they need now that the war is over. [...] As a pornographer, all I can do in response is to produce work that features men who are openly positive (or negative) and happily living their lives honestly and fully.\\"\\"Treasure Island Media's Maverick Sets the Record Straight About Porn, HIV, and 'The Complex Behavioral Language of Gay Sex'\\" Let's Talk About Sex, April 25, 2011 Sex Education Emerging research has suggested that pornography is a possible source of education about sex and relationships. In the absence of inclusive same-sex relationship education in traditional sources (i.e., schools, parents, friends, and mainstream media), gay pornography may be used by men who have sex with men as a source of information about intimacy, while serving its main purpose as a masturbatory aid. Contrary to popular views that pornography doesn't depict intimacy, a recent study showed that gay pornography depicts both physical and verbal intimacy.  Gay-for-pay  The authenticity and ethics behind gay-for-pay porn are highly disputed, even within the gay community. Viewers of gay porn in a survey by Escoffier reported a preference for authentic porn, which they define as exhibiting both erections and orgasms. Escoffier argues if straight-identifying actors are able to deliver erections and orgasms to the set, their performance is classified as situational homosexuality; therefore, the porn itself is authentic gay porn. Simon and Gagnon examine authenticity through scripts, arguing that porn actors follow learned behavioral sex scripts, so no porn is any more or less authentic than any other porn. Because the term \\"gay-for-pay\\" implies a motivation that is solely economic, Escoffier argues it is not a fitting title. Other reasons certain gay-for-pay actors report for their career choice include latent homosexual fantasy and curiosity. Among gay-for- pay actors, there is divided preference for the performance roles of top vs. bottom. It is common for gay-for-pay porn actors to start out as tops before they eventually give in to fan and industry pressure to shoot a scene or more as a bottom. Gay-for-pay actors are typically more comfortable being tops because the role of top is analogous to the \\"less gay\\" penetrator role of the man in straight sex. On the other hand, some gay-for-pay porn actors prefer to act as bottoms because they can do so without maintaining an erection. The implication here is that they are not even necessarily aroused during sex, making this the \\"less gay\\" of the two positions. Even though they are acting in gay porn, some gay-for-pay actors hold homophobic views, causing tension in the workplace. Additionally, gay actors often find it difficult to perform with straight actors due to the lack of attraction. Tommy Cruise, a bisexual actor in gay porn, is quoted saying, \\"A lot of straight guys, they don't even want me touching them. I'm like 'Why are you even in this business?'\\" However, some gay and bisexual porn actors, such as Buddy Jones, do enjoy working with straight men in some circumstances because as long as the sex is good, it doesn't matter to them how the other actor identifies sexually.

As awareness of the risk of AIDS developed, pornography producers came under pressure to use condoms, both for the health of the performers and to serve as role models for their viewers. By the early 1990s new pornographic videos usually featured the use of condoms for anal sex. However, beginning in the 1990s, an increasing number of studios have been devoted to the production of new films featuring men engaging in unprotected sex. For example, San Francisco-based studio Treasure Island Media, whose work focuses in this area, has produced bareback films since 1999. Other companies that do so include SEVP and Eurocreme. Mainstream gay pornographic studios such as Kristen Bjorn Productions have featured the occasional bareback scene, such as in \\"El Rancho\\" between performers who are real-life partners. Other studios such as Falcon Entertainment have also reissued older pre-condom films.\\"Bareback Classics\\" (FVS 301) is an example of such a re-issue by Falcon. Also, mainstream studios that consistently use condoms for anal sex scenes may sometimes choose editing techniques that make the presence of condoms somewhat ambiguous and less visually evident, and thus may encourage viewers to fantasize that barebacking is taking place, even though the performers are following safer-sex protocols. (In contrast, some mainstream directors are conscientious about using close-up shots of condom packets being opened, etc., to help clearly establish for the viewer that the sex is not bareback.) Some scholars argue that while \\"barebacking\\" and \\"UAI\\" technically both mean the same thing, they have different undertones. With the increased use of the term \\"barebacking\\", the term has been adopted for marketing purposes. This is because \\"Unprotected Anal Intercourse\\" makes a direct connection between unprotected sex and the risk of contracting diseases like HIV/AIDS. However, although \\"bareback\\" seems to have become the favorable term, studies show that both terms ultimately have equally negative implications. In a study where participants were shown two different scenes featuring anal sex, the significance of the words \\"bareback\\" and \\"UAI\\" became apparent. The first scene featured group sex in which several men were on top engaging in intercourse with one man on the bottom. The men on top were in their mid-30s and of varying ethnicities while the man on the bottom was around 18 years old. The second scene featured two men both in their 20s in a living room setting. During the interview, the participants were much more reluctant to classify the second scene as \\"bareback\\" or \\"UAI\\", than they were for the first scene. Participants readily used \\"bareback\\" to describe the first scene in which there were clear contrasts in race, age, and power. The participants described the second scene as being more \\"meaningful and romantic\\" and hence more likely to use a condom to protect the other. The implication of this study is that the term \\"bareback\\" ultimately does have a dark meaning as it relates to HIV/AIDS, regardless if it does not mention protection in its name. Thus, studies have shown that barebacking is decreasing in popularity within the gay subculture. Bareback pornography does not necessarily encourage more unprotected anal sex in reality, nor do all men who participate in anal sex necessarily want to have unprotected sex. What is clear is that there is still a sense of risk among participants of anal sex.

He lectured in mathematical physics at the University of Adelaide 1951‚Äì52, before being appointed in 1952 as Professor of Physics and Head of the School of Physics at the University of Sydney, a position he held for 35 years until his retirement in 1987. In 1952 he established the Nuclear Research Foundation, later known as the Science Foundation for Physics. Messel was also Chancellor and CEO of Bond University 1992‚Äì1997. In 1958 Professor Messel started the International Science School (ISS), which aims to encourage scientifically capable and interested students in their final two years of school to extend their knowledge and apply it to achieve progress. He frequently stated his discontent when sportsmen were praised and hailed whereas the next generation of scientists to change and run the world were given little to no encouragement. Since its inception, over 4,000 scholars have attended the ISS. The program runs once every two years with close to 150 students from up to 10 countries staying at the Women's College for two weeks, attending lectures and participating in activities around the University of Sydney.

Shah was born in Nairobi, Kenya. He lived in Kenya until he was twelve years old, when he moved to India with his family. While living in India, he became interested in films, and when his family moved to Crawley, he became involved in show business. His first film was the 1977 film Candleshoe, as a stand-in. When stunt coordinator Bob Anderson asked him to do her stunts as well, his career was started. Shah played the part of Bolum in the 1977 film The People That Time Forgot. Shah is often confused with Deep Roy; they are both dwarf Kenyan actors of Indian descent who got their starts in film and television in the late 1970s. He is the world's shortest stuntman according to the Guinness World Records. He has appeared as an actor in 31 films; 37 as stuntman or body double. Stand-in, stunt, and background work He has been in several blockbuster films since, such as Superman (1978), Superman II (1980), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), The Dark Crystal (1982), Return of the Jedi (1983), Legend (1985), Aliens (1986), The Sign of Four (1987), Bullseye! (1990), Braveheart (1995), and Titanic (1997) where he stunt doubled all the children in the film. He has appeared as a stunt double or stand-in in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film series. He was the scale double for Elijah Wood as Frodo, though he doubled for all the other main hobbits, being the only scale- double capable of stunts. He doubled Bilbo Baggins as played by both Martin Freeman (in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies) and Ian Holm (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring). He is one of only three actors to play the titular character in the Hobbit films. Character work His most featured role was as The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where he played Ginarrbrik. He also portrayed an Andaman islander in the Sherlock Holmes film The Sign of Four, and the monster who came out of a painting and attacked Natasha Richardson in the 1987 film Gothic. In addition to doubling for Martin Freeman as Bilbo in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, he also appeared as the Goblin Scribe. Shah appeared as the mysterious figure in the Steven Moffat scripted \\"Listen\\", the fourth episode of the eighth series of Doctor Who, also episode 2 of series 10 as Emojibot 1 in \\"Smile\\". Shah appeared in the 2015 Star Wars: The Force Awakens, as Teedo, a small, brutish scavenger that roams the planet Jakku's vast wasteland on his semi- mechanical Luggabeast.

It was initially named the Third Bosphorus Bridge (with Bosphorus Bridge being the First Bosphorus Bridge and Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge the Second Bosphorus Bridge). The bridge is located near the Black Sea entrance of the Bosphorus strait, between Garip√ße in Sarƒ±yer on the European side and Poyrazk√∂y in Beykoz on the Asian side. The foundation stone laying ceremony was held on 29 May 2013. The bridge was opened to traffic on 26 August 2016. At , the bridge is one of the tallest bridges in the world. After the Millau Viaduct in France and the Pingtang Bridge in China, it is the third-tallest bridge in the world of any type. The bridge is also one of the world's widest suspension bridges, at wide.  Project  The bridge is part of the projected Northern Marmara Motorway (), which will bypass urban areas of Istanbul in the north connecting Kƒ±nalƒ±, Silivri in the west and Pa≈üak√∂y, Hendek in the east. The bridge is in length with a main span of . The main span is the ninth longest suspension bridge in the world. View of the bridge. View of the bridge. Designed by the Swiss engineer Jean-Fran√ßois Klein (project leader) and by the French structural engineer Michel Virlogeux from T-ing√©nierie (a Geneva-based company), the bridge is a combined road-rail bridge. It carries four motorway lanes and one railway line in each direction. The construction was carried out by a consortium of the Turkish company ƒ∞√ßta≈ü and the Italian company Astaldi which won the bid to construct the structure on 30 May 2012. The budgeted cost of the bridge's construction was 4.5 billion TRY (approximately US$2.5 billion as of March 2013). The construction was originally expected to be completed in 36 months with the opening date scheduled for the end of 2015. On 29 May 2013 then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan directed the construction management team to finish the construction within 24 months, and projected an opening date for 29 May 2015. The bridge toll is set to be 9.90 between the motorway exits Odayeri and Pa≈üak√∂y. It is expected that at least 135,000 vehicles will use the bridge daily in each direction. Minister of Transport and Communication Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m stated that of the total area to be nationalised for the bridge project, 9.57% was private property, 75.24% was forested land, and the remaining 15.19% was already state-owned land. In June 2018, in the course of the Turkish currency and debt crisis, Bloomberg reported that Astaldi, an Italian multinational construction company, was poised to sell its stake in the flagship Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge project for $467 million. The project had failed to meet projections, requiring Ankara to boost operators' revenue from treasury coffers, and since early 2018 the partners in the joint venture sought restructuring of $2.3 billion of debt from creditors. On July 30, 2018, China's ICBC is authorized as the lead regulator to refinance the $2.7 billion current loan for the bridge.  Construction history  A view of the bridge from Yoros Castle on September 4, 2016. Plans for a third Bosphorus bridge were approved by the Ministry of Transportation in 2012. The construction of the project was awarded to the ƒ∞√ßta≈ü-Astaldi consortium on 29 May 2012. The construction of the bridge began officially with the foundation stone-laying in a ceremony held on 29 May 2013, the anniversary day of the conquest of Constantinople in 1453. The ceremony was attended by the then State President Abdullah G√ºl, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and numerous high-ranking officials. Erdoƒüan directed the construction management team to complete construction within 24 months, and set the opening date for 29 May 2015. A view of the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge on October 26, 2018. Work was temporarily halted in July 2013, after it became evident that the site was mislocated, but only after the removal of thousands of trees. The action, announced in paperwork filed for a plan change written by State Highways Directorate Director-General Mehmet Cahit Turhan on 11 June 2013, reads \\"it is appropriate to cancel the current construction plan due to the necessity of making a revision, which resulted from changes of the route project\\". Both the ministry and the construction company have denied any change to the construction site location. Land prices in the northern, less urbanized areas on both sides of the Bosphorus are already soaring in expectation of an urbanization boom thanks to the new cross-water connection, according to Ekumenopolis, a documentary film of 2010 about the area. The efficacy of the proclaimed goal of easing traffic congestion has been challenged, claiming that \\"the project is little more than a contrivance to open for development lands that had been long protected by law\\". The green areas and wetlands in question, producing most of the drinking water for the city, are considered by many to be \\"essential for Istanbul's ecological and economic sustainability, and a possible pollution of the groundwater would provoke the collapse of the city\\". In 1995, Erdoƒüan, then mayor of Istanbul, declared that a third bridge would mean \\"the murder of the city\\". On 5 April 2014, at about 21:00 local time, a fatal accident occurred during construction work at the link road to the bridge on the Asian side of the Bosphorus near √áavu≈üba≈üƒ±, Beykoz. Three workers were killed and another was injured by falling from a collapsed scaffolding while concrete was poured at a viaduct.  Naming  9th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Selim I (1470‚Äì1520) The name of the bridge was announced by President Abdullah G√ºl at the ground-breaking ceremony as the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, in honor of Ottoman Sultan Selim I (c. 1470‚Äì1520), who expanded the Ottoman Empire into the Middle East and North Africa in 1514‚Äì1517 and obtained the title of Caliph of Islam for the Ottoman dynasty after his conquest of Egypt in 1517. He was nicknamed Yavuz, traditionally translated in English as \\"Grim\\", but closer to \\"Stern\\" or \\"Implacable\\" in meaning.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/08/27/istanbuls- new-3-billion-bridge-has-a-very-divisive-name/ In 1520 he was succeeded by his son Suleiman the Magnificent. The choice of name for the bridge has led to protests by Alevis in Turkey because of the alleged role of Sultan Selim I in the Ottoman persecution of Alevis. After the ≈ûahkulu Rebellion (1511) in Anatolia, and the Battle of Chaldiran (1514) in northwestern Iran, during which the Qizilbash warriors of the Alevis in eastern Anatolia (who adhere to the Shia sect of Islam) sided with Shah Ismail I of Safavid Persia, the victorious Selim I ordered the massacre of the Qizilbash, whom he considered traitors and heretics (see also Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid relations and Ottoman‚ÄìPersian Wars).  Opening ceremony  The opening ceremony on 26 August 2016 was attended by Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, Bosniak president of Bosnia and Herzegovina Bakir Izetbegoviƒá, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, the King of Bahrain Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and President of the self- declared state of Northern Cyprus Mustafa Akƒ±ncƒ±. Also, Chief Minister of Punjab (Pakistan) Shahbaz Sharif, Sand≈æak Bosniak Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia Rasim Ljajiƒá, First Vice Prime Minister of Georgia Dimitri Kumsishvili and high-ranking officials from Azerbaijan also attended the opening ceremony.

Abdullah was one of the many sons of Ibn Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia. Abdullah held important political posts throughout most of his adult life. In 1961 he became mayor of Mecca, his first public office. The following year, he was appointed commander of the Saudi Arabian National Guard, a post he was still holding when he became king. He also served as deputy defense minister and was named crown prince when his half-brother Fahd took the throne in 1982. After King Fahd suffered a serious stroke in 1995, Abdullah became the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia until ascending the throne a decade later. During his reign he maintained close relations with United States and United Kingdom and bought billions of dollars worth of defense equipment from both states.

Saudi Arabia: Fundamental change? Al Jazeera 19 October 2010 In November 2013, a BBC report claimed that, due to the close relations it had with Pakistan, Saudi Arabia could obtain nuclear weapons at will from that country.Saudi nuclear weapons 'on order' from Pakistan BBC The King also had a longstanding relationship with Pakistan, and brokered a compromise between ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and General Pervez Musharraf, whom he had requested to be exiled to Saudi Arabia for a 10-year exile, following his ouster in the 1999 Pakistani coup d'√©tat. The King outlived two of his crown princes, who were all among the Sudairi Seven full brothers (which had included King Fahd). Conservative Interior Minister Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud was named heir to the throne on the death of Sultan bin Abdulaziz in October 2011, but Nayef himself died in June 2012. Abdullah then named 76-year-old Defense Minister Salman bin Abdulaziz as crown prince. According to various reports, Abdullah married up to 30 times and had more than 35 children. The King had a personal fortune estimated at US$18 billion, making him the third-wealthiest head of state in the world. He died on 23 January 2015, at the age of 90, three weeks after being hospitalized for pneumonia, and was succeeded by his half-brother Salman. Early life Abdullah is said to have been born on 1 August 1924 in Riyadh. However, some sources state that this date is incorrect, and that he was approximately eight years older. He was the tenth son of King Abdulaziz. His mother, Fahda bint Asi Al Shuraim, was a member of the Al Rashid dynasty, longtime rivals of the Al Saud dynasty. She was descended from the powerful Shammar tribe and was the daughter of former tribe chief, Asi Shuraim. She died when Abdullah was six years old. He had younger full-sisters, Nouf and Seeta. Madawi Al-Rasheed argues that his maternal roots and his earlier experience of a speech impediment led to delay in his rise to higher status among the other sons of King Abdulaziz. Commander of National Guard Saudi National Guard In 1963, Abdullah was made commander of Saudi National Guard (SANG). This post allowed him to secure his position in the House of Saud. SANG, which had been based on the Ikhwan, became a modern armed force under his command. Beginning 1985, SANG also sponsored the Janadiriyah festival that institutionalized traditional folk dances, camel races and tribal heritage. Second in line King Khalid appointed Abdullah as second deputy prime minister on 29 March 1975 just four days after his kingship which was a reflection of his status as second in the line of succession to the Saudi throne. Therefore, he became the number three-man in the Saudi administration. However, his appointment caused friction in the House of Saud. Then-crown prince Fahd, together with his full-brothers known as the Sudairi Seven, supported the appointment of their own full brother, Sultan. Abdullah was pressured to cede control of SANG in return for his appointment as second deputy prime minister. In August 1977, this generated a debate among hundreds of princes in Riyadh. Abdullah did not relinquish authority of SANG because he feared that this would weaken his authority. Crown Prince and Regent Abdullah with US Vice President Dan Quayle On 13 June 1982 ‚Äì the day King Khalid died ‚Äì Fahd bin Abdulaziz became King, Abdullah became Crown Prince the same day and also maintained his position as head of the National Guard. During his years as crown prince, Abdullah bin Abdulaziz was described as a supporter of accommodation. He managed to group a large number of fringe and marginalized princes discontented with the prospect of the succession being passed among the Sudairi brothers one after the other. His control of the National Guard was also a key factor to his success in becoming crown prince. When King Fahd was incapacitated by a major stroke in 1995,\\"King Fahd ibn Abdel Aziz Al Saud: The Times obituary\\", Times Online, 1 August 2005. Retrieved 29 March 2008. Crown Prince Abdullah acted as de facto regent of Saudi Arabia. On 4 June 2000, the Al Saud Family Council was established by Crown Prince Abdullah to discuss some private issues, including the business activities of House of Saud members and the marriages of princesses to nonroyals. In May 2001 Crown Prince Abdullah did not accept an invitation to visit Washington due to US support for Israel in the Second Intifada. He also appeared more eager than King Fahd to cut government spending and open Saudi Arabia up economically. He pushed for Saudi membership of the World Trade Organization, surprising some. In August 2001, he ordered then Saudi Ambassador to the US, Bandar bin Sultan, to return to Washington. This reportedly occurred after Crown Prince Abdullah witnessed brutality inflicted by an Israeli soldier upon a Palestinian woman. Later, he also condemned Israel for attacking families of suspects. In 2002, he developed the Arab Peace Initiative, commonly referred to as the \\"Abdullah plan\\", to achieve a mutually agreed-on resolution of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. The initiative was adopted at the Arab League's Beirut summit in March 2002. On the second anniversary of the September 11 attacks, Crown Prince Abdullah wrote a letter to US President George W. Bush, which ended with the following words: > \\"God Almighty, in His wisdom, tests the faithful by allowing such calamities > to happen. But He, in His mercy, also provides us with the will and > determination, generated by faith, to enable us to transform such tragedies > into great achievements, and crises that seem debilitating are transformed > into opportunities for the advancement of humanity. I only hope that, with > your cooperation and leadership, a new world will emerge out of the rubble > of the World Trade Center: a world that is blessed by the virtues of > freedom, peace, prosperity and harmony.\\" By late 2003, after the Saudi Arabian branch of al-Qaeda carried out a series of bombings that threatened to destabilize the country, Crown Prince Abdullah, together with other decision-making elites began to deal with political concerns. As Toby Jones wrote in Middle East Report: > One of such moves was his project to promote more tolerance for religious > diversity and rein in the forces of politico-religious extremism in the > kingdom, leading to the establishment of National Dialogue. In the summer of > 2003, Abdullah threw his considerable weight behind the creation of a > national dialogue that brought leading religious figures together, including > a highly publicized meeting attended by the kingdom's preeminent Shi'i > scholar Hasan al-Saffar, as well as a group of Sunni clerics that had > previously expressed their loathing for the Shi'i minority. King of Saudi Arabia Royal Standard of the King Abdullah succeeded to the throne upon the death of his half-brother King Fahd. He was formally enthroned on 2 August 2005. Domestic affairs King Abdullah's administration attempted reforms in different fields. In 2005, King Abdullah implemented a government scholarship program to send young Saudi men and women abroad for undergraduate and postgraduate studies in different universities around the world. The program offered funds for tuition and living expenses up to four years. It is estimated that more than 70,000 young Saudis studied abroad in more than 25 countries, with the United States, England, and Australia as top three destinations aimed for by the students. There are more than 22,000 Saudi students studying in the United States, exceeding pre-9/11 levels. Public health engagement included breast cancer awareness and CDC cooperation to set up an advanced epidemic screening network to protect 2010's three million Hajj pilgrims. In 2005 King Abdullah declared that the national day of the country, 23 September, would be a public holiday in an attempt to reduce the influence of religious figures and some of the social restrictions. It was criticized by the religious figures who argued that such celebration was not part of Islam. King Abdullah implemented many reform measures. He re-shuffled the ministry of education's leadership in February 2009 by bringing in his pro-reform son-in- law, Faisal bin Abdullah, as the new minister. He also appointed Nora Al Fayez, a U.S.-educated former teacher, as deputy education minister in charge of a new department for female students. He brought about a top-to-bottom restructuring of the country's courts to introduce, among other things, review of judicial decisions and more professional training for Shari'a judges. He developed a new investment promotion agency to overhaul the once-convoluted process of starting a business in Saudi Arabia and created a regulatory body for capital markets. He also promoted the construction of the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology (the country's new flagship and controversially co-ed institution for advanced scientific research). King Abdullah invested in educating the workforce for future jobs. The Saudi government also encouraged the development of non-hydrocarbon sectors in which the Kingdom had a comparative advantage, including mining, solar energy, and religious tourism. The Kingdom's 2010 budget reflected these priorities‚Äîabout 25 percent was devoted to education alone‚Äîand amounts to a significant economic stimulus package.Screensetter for Clinton's visit Wikileaks, 2010 Russian President Vladimir Putin on 11 February 2007 The response of his administration to homegrown terrorism was a series of crackdowns including raids by security forces, arrests, torture and public beheadings.Brown, Colin.

He also made the protection of Saudi Arabia's critical infrastructure a top security priority. His strategy against terrorism was two-pronged: he attacked the roots of the extremism that fed Al- Qaida through education and judicial reforms to weaken the influence of the most reactionary elements of Saudi Arabia's religious establishment. In August 2010, King Abdullah decreed that only officially approved religious scholars associated with the Senior Council of Ulema would be allowed to issue fatwas. Similar decrees since 2005 were previously seldom enforced. Individual fatwas relating to personal matters were exempt from the royal decree. The decree also instructed the Grand Mufti to identify eligible scholars. In light of the Arab Spring, Abdullah laid down a $37 billion (‚Ç¨32.8 billion) programme of new spending including new jobless benefits, education and housing subsidies, debt write-offs, and a new sports channel. There was also a pledge to spend a total of $400 billion by the end of 2014 to improve education, health care and the kingdom's infrastructure. However, Saudi police arrested 100 Shiite protesters who complained of government discrimination. Later during the 2011‚Äì2012 Saudi Arabian protests, in September 2011, the King announced women's right to vote in the 2015 municipal council elections, a first significant reform step in the country since the protests. He also stated that women would become eligible to take part in the unelected shura.Asma Alsharif, \\"Saudi king gives women right to vote-UPDATE 2\\", Reuters, 25 September 2011. Retrieved 25 September 2011. In January 2012, King Abdullah dismissed the head of Saudi Arabia's powerful religious police, replacing him with a more moderate cleric, state news agency SPA reported, without giving reasons. Abdullatif Abdel Aziz al-Sheikh was named, in place of Sheikh Abdulaziz al Humain, to head the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice. King Abdullah had appointed Humain in 2009 to head the \\"mutaween,\\" which ensures the strict application of the country's ultra-conservative version of Islam, as a step towards reforming it. Humain hired consultants to restructure the organisation, met local human rights groups and consulted professional image- builders in a broad public relations campaign. Under his leadership the commission also investigated and punished some \\"out-of-control\\" officers for misbehaviour. King Abdullah University of Science and Technology In July 2012, Saudi Arabia announced that it would allow its women athletes to compete in the Olympics for the first time and that the country's Olympic Committee would \\"oversee participation of women athletes who can qualify\\". The decision ended speculation that the entire Saudi team might have been disqualified on grounds of gender discrimination. The public participation of women in sport was still fiercely opposed by many Saudi religious conservatives. There had been almost no public tradition of women participating in sport in the country. Saudi officials said that, if successful in qualifying, female competitors would be dressed \\"to preserve their dignity\\". On 11 January 2013, King Abdullah appointed thirty women to the Consultative Assembly or Shura Council and modified the related law to mandate that no less than 20 percent of 150 members would be women. In August 2013, the Saudi cabinet, for the first time, approved a law making domestic violence a criminal offence. The law calls for a punishment of up to a year in prison and a fine of up to 50,000 riyals (‚Ç¨11,500/US$13,000). The maximum punishments could be doubled for repeat offenders. The law criminalizes psychological, sexual as well as physical abuse. It also includes a provision obliging employees to report instances of abuse in the workplace to their employer. The move followed a Twitter campaign. The new laws were welcomed by Saudi women's rights activists, although some expressed concerns that the law could not be implemented successfully without new training for the judiciary, and that the tradition of male guardianship would remain an obstacle to prosecutions. Interfaith dialogue In November 2007, King Abdullah visited Pope Benedict XVI in the Apostolic Palace, being first Saudi monarch to do so.

United States Abdullah visits the United States in April 2005 King Abdullah had long been pro-American and a longtime close ally of the United States. In October 1976, as Prince Abdullah was being trained for greater responsibility in Riyadh, he was sent to the United States to meet with President Gerald Ford. He again traveled to the United States as Crown Prince in October 1987, meeting Vice President George H. W. Bush. In September 1998, Crown Prince Abdullah made a state visit to the United States to meet in Washington with President Bill Clinton. In September 2000, he attended millennium celebrations at the United Nations in New York City. In April 2002, Crown Prince Abdullah made a state visit to the United States with President George W. Bush and he returned again in April 2005 with Bush. In April 2009, at a summit for world leaders President Barack Obama met with King Abdullah, while in June 2009 he hosted President Obama in Saudi Arabia. In turn, Obama hosted the King at the White House in the same month. King Abdullah showed great support for Obama's presidency. \\"Thank God for bringing Obama to the presidency\\", he said, adding that Obama's election created \\"great hope\\" in the Muslim world. He stated, \\"We (the US and Saudi Arabia) spilled blood together\\" in Kuwait and Iraq, that Saudi Arabia valued this tremendously and that friendship could be a difficult issue that requires work, but that the United States and Saudi Arabia had done it for 70 years over three generations. \\"Our disagreements don't cut to the bone\\", he stated. He was the leading gift-giver to the US president and his office in his first two years in office, his gifts totaling more than $300,000. A ruby and diamond jewelry set, given by the king and accepted by Michelle Obama on behalf of the United States, was worth $132,000. However, according to US federal law, gifts of such nature and value are accepted \\"on behalf of the United States\\" and are considered property of the US government.

The King expressed a complete lack of trust in Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki and held out little hope for improved Saudi-Iraqi relations as long as al-Maliki remained in office. King Abdullah told an Iraqi official about Al Maliki, \\"You and Iraq are in my heart, but that man is not.\\" In September 2014, following the spread of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), he issued a statement, \\"From the cradle of revelation and the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad, I call on leaders and scholars of the Islamic nation to carry out their duty towards God Almighty, and to stand in the face of those trying to hijack Islam and present it to the world as a religion of extremism, hatred, and terrorism, and to speak the word of truth, and not fear anybody.

Iran Barack Obama meets with King Abdullah In 2006, Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei had sent his adviser Ali Akbar Velayati with a letter asking for King Abdullah's agreement to establish a formal back channel of communication between the two leaders. Abdullah said he had agreed, and the channel was established, with Velayati and Saud Al Faisal as the points of contact. In the ensuing years, the King noted, the channel had never been used. In April 2008, according to a US cable released by WikiLeaks, King Abdullah had told the US Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, and General David Petraeus to \\"cut off the head of the snake\\".

King Abdullah asserted that Iran was trying to set up Hezbollah-like organizations in African countries, observing that the Iranians didn't think they were doing anything wrong and didn't recognize their mistakes. He said that the Iranians \\"launch missiles with the hope of putting fear in people and the world\\". The King described his conversation with Iranian foreign minister Mottaki as \\"a heated exchange, frankly discussing Iran's interference in Arab affairs\\". When challenged by the King on Iranian meddling in Hamas affairs, Mottaki apparently protested that \\"these are Muslims\\". \\"No, Arabs\\", countered the King. \\"You as Persians have no business meddling in Arab matters\\". King Abdullah said he would favor Rafsanjani in an Iranian election. He told General Jones that Iranian internal turmoil presented an opportunity to weaken the regime‚Äîwhich he encouraged‚Äîbut he also urged that this be done covertly, stressing that public statements in support of the reformers were counterproductive. The King assessed that sanctions could help weaken the government, but only if they are strong and sustained. Bahrain Saudi Arabia, by the endorsement of the Gulf Cooperation Council, sent 1,200 troops to Bahrain to protect industrial facilities, resulting in strained relations with the United States. The military personnel were part of the Peninsula Shield Force, which is stationed in Saudi Arabia, but not affiliated to one country alone.Doward, Jamie, and Philippa Stewart, \\"UK Training Saudi Forces Used to Crush Arab Spring\\" The Guardian, 28 May 2011. Guant√°namo Bay In December 2010, leaked diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks revealed that King Abdullah wanted all released detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp to be tracked using an implanted microchip, in a way similar to race horses. The King made the private suggestion during a meeting in Riyadh in March 2009 with White House counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan. Brennan replied that \\"horses don't have good lawyers\\" and that such a proposal would \\"face legal hurdles\\" in the United States. China Since King Abdullah's visit to Beijing in January 2006, Saudi-Chinese relations have focused predominantly on energy and trade. The king's visit was the first by a Saudi head of state to China since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1990. Bilateral trade with China has more than tripled, and China would soon be Saudi Arabia's largest importer. Saudi Arabia also committed significant investments in China, including the $8 billion Fujian refinery. Based on a WikiLeaks cable, the King told the Chinese that it was willing to effectively trade a guaranteed oil supply in return for Chinese pressure on Iran not to develop nuclear weapons. In late March 2011, King Abdullah sent Bandar, Secretary General of the National Security Council, to China to gain its support regarding Saudi Arabia's attitude towards the Arab Spring. In turn, lucrative arms contracts were secretly offered to China by the Kingdom. Furthermore, King Abdullah believed that China as well as India were the future markets for Saudi energy. Relations with other nations Abdullah with Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, President of Poland In November 2009, King Abdullah was received by Nicolas Sarkozy, who committed various diplomatic faux pas. The diplomatic relationship Jacques Chirac had with Saudi Arabia was not evident with Sarkozy. In January 2011, the Kingdom granted asylum to the ousted Tunisian leader, Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, under conditions of no further political involvement. According to leaked cables, King Abdullah was more receptive than Crown Prince Sultan to former Yemeni President Saleh. King Abdullah supported renewed diplomatic relations with the Syrian government and Bashar al-Assad. They met in Damascus on 7 October 2009. In addition, Assad attended the opening of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in October 2009. Relations between Syria and Saudi Arabia deteriorated as a result of the Syrian Civil War. In August 2011, King Abdullah recalled the Saudi Ambassador from Damascus due to the political unrest in Syria and closed its embassy. In December 2011, King Abdullah called on leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council to strengthen their alliance into a united \\"single entity\\" as they confront threats to national security. \\"I ask you today to move from a stage of cooperation to a stage of union in a single entity\\", King Abdullah said at the opening session of a GCC meeting in Riyadh in comments aired on Saudi state television. \\"No doubt, you all know we are targeted in our security and stability\\". Criticism as king On 16 February 2003, Parade magazine's David Wallechinsky rated King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah as the second worst dictators in the world. Most of this criticism stems from the fact that most of Saudi citizens live under a strict Wahhabist interpretation of Sharia law, which mandates the amputation of hands as a punishment for theft and floggings for crimes like drunkenness. Execution by public beheading is common for murder, rape, drug trafficking and witchcraft, and Abdullah's policies towards the rights of women have also been criticized. In a slight rebuff to accusations of human rights violations, Saudi inmates of Najran Province sent the King well-wishes from jail and wished him a speedy recovery. King Abdullah has also been criticized for his policies on religious freedom and the Saudi government allegedly has arrested Shiite pilgrims on the Hajj. On 24 January 2007, Human Rights Watch sent an open letter to King Abdullah asking him to cease religious persecution of the Ahmadi faith in Saudi Arabia. Two letters were sent in November 2006 and February 2007 asking him to remove the travel ban on critics of the Saudi government. Human Rights Watch has not yet indicated whether they have received any response to these letters. On 30 October 2007, during a state visit to the UK, King Abdullah was accused by protestors of being a \\"murderer\\" and a \\"torturer\\". Concerns were raised about the treatment of women and homosexuals by the Saudi kingdom and over alleged bribes involving arms deals between Saudi Arabia and the UK.Saudi king's royal meet draws fire, CNN, 31 October 2007.

The title of Crown Prince then passed to Prince Sultan's full-brother, Nayef, until his death in Geneva, Switzerland, on 16 June 2012, while undergoing medical tests for an undisclosed ailment. His third heir apparent was his half-brother Salman, who was named as Crown Prince on 18 June 2012, and would succeed him in 2015. In 2006, Abdullah set up the Allegiance Council, a body that is composed of the sons and grandsons of Saudi Arabia's founder, King Abdulaziz, to vote by a secret ballot to choose future kings and crown princes. The council's mandate was not to have started until after the reigns of both King Abdullah and late Prince Sultan were over. It was not clear what was to happen when Prince Sultan died before the end of Abdullah's reign, leaving a question as to whether the council would vote for a new crown prince, or whether Prince Nayef would automatically fill that position. Despite such concerns, Prince Nayef was appointed Crown Prince on 27 October 2011 after consultation with the Allegiance Council by Abdullah.Aged Saudi ruler to fly to US over blood clot AP 21 November 2010 In November 2010, Prince Nayef chaired a cabinet meeting because of the deterioration of the King's health.

King Abdullah is credited with building up the once largely ceremonial unit into a modern 260,000-strong force that is a counterweight to the army. The Guard, which was Abdullah's original power base, protects the royal family. This was suggested as an apparent sign that the elderly monarch was beginning to lessen some of his duties.

After 2014, media reports of their condition dried up. Illness and death The King had curtailed his activities from June 2010 with no clear explanation. Diplomats said there had been uncertainty about the extent of his health problems since Abdullah canceled a visit to France. In a television appearance in which he was seen to use a cane, King Abdullah said he was in good health but had something \\"bothering\\" him. In a visit by US diplomats to Saudi Arabia in April 2014 the Saudi King was seen connected to breathing tubes during talks, indicating increasing health problems. From 2010 to 2012 King Abdullah had four back surgeries. The first two of the surgeries were in New York, one in 2010 for a slipped disk and a blood clot pressing on nerves in his back and a second to stabilize vertebrae in 2011. The third one was in Riyadh in 2011. And the last one was also in Riyadh on 17 November 2012. In November 2010, his back problems came to light in the media. He had an \\"accumulation of blood\\" around the spinal cord. He suffered from a herniated disc and was told to rest by doctors. To maintain the Kingdom's stability, Crown Prince Sultan returned from Morocco during the King's absence. The King was admitted to NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital after a blood clot complicated a slipped disc and underwent successful back surgery. The lead surgeon was Muhammad Zaka, who probably removed the herniated disk and performed a lumbar fusion. He subsequently had another successful surgery in which surgeons \\"stabilized a number of vertebras\\". He left the hospital on 22 December 2010 and convalesced at The Plaza in New York City. On 22 January 2011, he left the United States for Morocco,\\"Saudi King Arrives in Morocco After Treatment in US\\", New York Times, 22 January 2011 and returned to the Kingdom on 23 February 2011. King Abdullah left Saudi Arabia on \\"special leave\\" on 27 August 2012. Al-Quds reported that he had an operation at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, on or before 4 September 2012, following a heart attack. However, there was no official report on this alleged operation‚Äîinstead, it was announced that the King went on a private trip to Morocco, where he was known to frequent. The King returned to Saudi Arabia from Morocco on 24 September. Nearly two months later, in November 2012, King Abdullah underwent another back surgery in Riyadh and left hospital on 13 December 2012. A report in April 2014 stated that the King had around six months left to live, citing a diagnosis of terminal lung cancer.Saudi King may die in 6 months Press TV. 19 April 2014.

Three days of national mourning were declared, in which flags would fly at half-mast. Flags were also flown half-mast at Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey in London. Philanthropy *While still Crown Prince, Abdullah paid for the separation surgery of a pair of Polish conjoined twins, which took place at the King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh on 3 January 2005.

When it opened in 1927, it was the second high school for black students in St. Louis. Since 1934, the school has won 14 state basketball championships ‚Äì six as a member of the Missouri Negro Interscholastic Athletic Association and then eight as a member of the Missouri State High School Activities Association.Prior to its integration in 1954, the Missouri State High School Activities Association (MSHSAA) did not permit black schools to participate in postseason tournaments, and Vashon competed in the Missouri Negro Interscholastic Athletic Association (MNIAA), a state athletic association for black schools. For MSHSAA championship counts for Missouri high schools, see ; for MNIAA championship information, see Vashon had previously held the state championships for 2001, 2004, and 2006; however, its titles were removed due to violations of MSHSAA rules, leaving the team with 8 MSHSAA championships (1971, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1994, 2000, 2002) and 6 MNIAA championships (1935, 1936, 1944, 1947, 1948, 1949). For information on the violations, see History Designed by Rockwell M. Milligan, the school opened on September 11, 1927, and it was named in honor of two African-American educators: George Boyer Vashon, the first black graduate of Oberlin College, and his son, John Boyer Vashon. Located at 3026 Laclede Avenue, construction costs were slightly less than $1.2 million. Vashon was the second high school built for black students in the St. Louis Public Schools, after Sumner High School. Four members of the Vashon glee club created the popular singing group The Four Vagabonds in 1933. From 1935 to 1949, Vashon's boys basketball program won six state titles as part of the Missouri Negro Interscholastic Athletic Association. Vashon was barred from joining the Missouri State High School Activities Association until 1949, and between 1949 and 1954, it was prohibited from participating in both MNIAA tournaments and MSHSAA state tournaments. In June 1963, the school relocated to the Hadley Vocational- Technical High School building at 3405 Bell Avenue, and the original building became part of Harris‚ÄìStowe State University. The Bell Avenue building had been constructed in the early 1930s with large shop classrooms that were subsequently divided into classrooms and offices with partition walls, causing noise problems throughout the school. Its architectural design also strongly resembled a factory, and according to a local newspaper report, \\"the main school building, gym and auditorium make one think the people inside might be manufacturing cars or widgets.\\" The move was accompanied by protests in the local community and a student march against the transfer. After the transfer, Vashon students were offered more vocational classes, including auto repair, fashion design, cosmetology, dry cleaning, woodworking, shoe repair, drafting, and commercial cooking. From 1974 to 2006, Vashon's boys basketball team was coached by Floyd Irons, a Vashon alumnus, who would become one of the winningest basketball coaches in Missouri history. Irons went on to coach the team through four state championships in the 1980s. In 1990, the Board of Education considered several options to deal with both noise problems and facilities issues at Vashon; among the options were closure of Vashon, partial renovation, full renovation, or complete demolition and replacement. Ultimately the Board decided against closure and opted for partial renovation of the building; support from the school's alumni and the school's strong boys basketball program played a role in the decision to keep the school open. In 1994, the Vashon boys basketball team won another state championship under Irons. In August 2002, Vashon moved again, to a new building at 3035 Cass Avenue designed by Kennedy and Associates and built at a cost of $47.3 million. The boys basketball team also saw a series of state championship victories in the 2000s, including wins in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2006. In 2005, the school's boys basketball program was ranked as the top program in the United States by USA Today. In 2006, the Riverfront Times, a local newspaper, published an investigative report that detailed extensive allegations of misconduct by Floyd Irons as coach at Vashon. The allegations eventually led the Missouri State High School Activities Association (MSHSAA) to strip Vashon of its 2001, 2002, and 2006 titles due to violations of MSHSAA rules on recruiting and eligibility. In July 2006, Irons was dismissed as coach and administrator at Vashon, and he was replaced as head coach by Anthony Bonner, a retired NBA player and Vashon alumnus. Bonner himself resigned in 2009. Sports and activities For the 2011‚Äì2012 school year, the school offered 18 activities approved by the Missouri State High School Activities Association (MSHSAA): baseball, boys and girls basketball, cheerleading, boys and girls cross country, football, music activities, boys and girls soccer, softball, speech and debate, boys and girls tennis, boys and girls track and field, girls volleyball, and wrestling. In addition to its current activities, its students have won several state championships: *Boys basketball: 1935, 1936, 1944, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1971, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1994, 2000, 2004, 2016, 2017Prior to its integration in 1954, the Missouri State High School Activities Association did not permit black schools to participate in postseason tournaments; prior to 1949, Vashon competed in the Missouri Negro Interscholastic Athletic Association, a state athletic system for black schools.

This statue is a Roman-era copy of an earlier Greek statue from the third century BC.Christopher H. Hallett, (2005), The Roman Nude: Heroic Portrait Statuary 200 BC‚ÄìAD 300, page 294. Oxford University Press The scroll in his right hand is an 18th-century restoration. Cynicism () is a school of thought of ancient Greek philosophy as practiced by the Cynics (, ). For the Cynics, the purpose of life is to live in virtue, in agreement with nature. As reasoning creatures, people can gain happiness by rigorous training and by living in a way which is natural for themselves, rejecting all conventional desires for wealth, power, and fame. Instead, they were to lead a simple life free from all possessions. The first philosopher to outline these themes was Antisthenes, who had been a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BC. He was followed by Diogenes, who lived in a ceramic jar on the streets of Athens.La√´rtius & Hicks 1925, VI:23 ; Jerome, Adversus Jovinianum, 2.14. Diogenes took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by Crates of Thebes, who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism gradually declined in importance after the 3rd century BC, but it experienced a revival with the rise of the Roman Empire in the 1st century. Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the empire, and similar ascetic and rhetorical ideas appeared in early Christianity. By the 19th century, emphasis on the negative aspects of Cynic philosophy led to the modern understanding of cynicism to mean a disposition of disbelief in the sincerity or goodness of human motives and actions. Origin of the Cynic name The name Cynic derives (genitive: kynos).Kynikos, \\"A Greek-English Lexicon\\", Liddell and Scott, at Perseus One explanation offered in ancient times for why the Cynics were called \\"dogs\\" was because the first Cynic, Antisthenes, taught in the Cynosarges gymnasium at Athens.Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 13. Cf. The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature, 2nd edition, p. 165. The word cynosarges means the \\"place of the white dog\\". It seems certain, however, that the word dog was also thrown at the first Cynics as an insult for their shameless rejection of conventional manners, and their decision to live on the streets. Diogenes, in particular, was referred to as the \\"Dog\\",An obscure reference to \\"the Dog\\" in Aristotle's Rhetoric (3.10.1411a25) is generally agreed to be the first reference to Diogenes. a distinction he seems to have revelled in, stating that \\"other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them.\\"Diogenes of Sinope, quoted by Stobaeus, Florilegium, iii. 13. 44. Later Cynics also sought to turn the word to their advantage, as a later commentator explained: Philosophy Cynicism is one of the most striking of all the Hellenistic philosophies. It claimed to offer people the possibility of happiness and freedom from suffering in an age of uncertainty. Although there was never an official Cynic doctrine, the fundamental principles of Cynicism can be summarized as follows:Navia, Luis E. Classical Cynicism: A Critical Study. pg 140. * The goal of life is eudaimonia and mental clarity or lucidity (·ºÅœÑœÖœÜŒπŒ±) - literally \\"freedom from smoke (œÑœçœÜŒøœÇ)\\" which signified false belief, mindlessness, folly, and conceit. * Eudaimonia is achieved by living in accord with Nature as understood by human reason. * Arrogance (œÑœçœÜŒøœÇ) is caused by false judgments of value, which cause negative emotions, unnatural desires, and a vicious character. * Eudaimonia, or human flourishing, depends on self- sufficiency (Œ±·ΩêœÑŒ¨œÅŒ∫ŒµŒπŒ±), equanimity, arete, love of humanity, parrhesia, and indifference to the vicissitudes of life (adiaphora ·ºÅŒ¥ŒπŒ±œÜŒøœÅŒØŒ±). * One progresses towards flourishing and clarity through ascetic practices (·ºÑœÉŒ∫Œ∑œÉŒπœÇ) which help one become free from influences ‚Äì such as wealth, fame, and power ‚Äì that have no value in Nature. Examples include Diogenes' practice of living in a tub and walking barefoot in winter. * A Cynic practices shamelessness or impudence (ŒëŒΩŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒµŒπŒ±) and defaces the nomos of society; the laws, customs, and social conventions which people take for granted. The Cynics adopted Heracles, shown here in this gilded bronze statue from the second century AD, as their patron hero. Thus a Cynic has no property and rejects all conventional values of money, fame, power and reputation. A life lived according to nature requires only the bare necessities required for existence, and one can become free by unshackling oneself from any needs which are the result of convention. The Cynics adopted Heracles as their hero, as epitomizing the ideal Cynic.Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 2, 71; Dio Chrysostom, Orations, viii. 26‚Äì32; Pseudo-Lucian, Cynicus, 13; Lucian, De Morte Peregrini, 4, 33, 36. Heracles \\"was he who brought Cerberus, the hound of Hades, from the underworld, a point of special appeal to the dog-man, Diogenes.\\"Orlando Patterson: Freedom. p. 186 According to Lucian, \\"Cerberus and Cynic are surely related through the dog.\\"Lucian, Dialogues of the Dead, 21 The Cynic way of life required continuous training, not just in exercising judgments and mental impressions, but a physical training as well: > [Diogenes] used to say, that there were two kinds of exercise: that, namely, > of the mind and that of the body; and that the latter of these created in > the mind such quick and agile impressions at the time of its performance, as > very much facilitated the practice of virtue; but that one was imperfect > without the other, since the health and vigour necessary for the practice of > what is good, depend equally on both mind and body.Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 70 None of this meant that a Cynic would retreat from society. Cynics were in fact to live in the full glare of the public's gaze and be quite indifferent in the face of any insults which might result from their unconventional behaviour. The Cynics are said to have invented the idea of cosmopolitanism: when he was asked where he came from, Diogenes replied that he was \\"a citizen of the world, (kosmopolit√™s).\\"Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 63 The ideal Cynic would evangelise; as the watchdog of humanity, they thought it their duty to hound people about the error of their ways. The example of the Cynic's life (and the use of the Cynic's biting satire) would dig up and expose the pretensions which lay at the root of everyday conventions. Although Cynicism concentrated primarily on ethics, some Cynics, such as Monimus, addressed epistemology with regard to tuphos (œÑ·ø¶œÜŒøœÇ) expressing skeptical views. Cynic philosophy had a major impact on the Hellenistic world, ultimately becoming an important influence for Stoicism. The Stoic Apollodorus, writing in the 2nd century BC, stated that \\"Cynicism is the short path to virtue.\\"Diogenes La√´rtius, vii. 121 History of Cynicism Bust of Antisthenes The classical Greek and Roman Cynics regarded virtue as the only necessity for happiness, and saw virtue as entirely sufficient for attaining it. Classical Cynics followed this philosophy to the extent of neglecting everything not furthering their perfection of virtue and attainment of happiness, thus, the title of Cynic, derived from the Greek word Œ∫œçœâŒΩ (meaning \\"dog\\") because they allegedly neglected society, hygiene, family, money, etc., in a manner reminiscent of dogs. They sought to free themselves from conventions; become self-sufficient; and live only in accordance with nature. They rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money, power, and fame, to lead entirely virtuous, and thus happy, lives.Cynics ‚Äì The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy The ancient Cynics rejected conventional social values, and would criticise the types of behaviours, such as greed, which they viewed as causing suffering. Emphasis on this aspect of their teachings led, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries,David Mazella, (2007), The Making of Modern Cynicism, University of Virginia Press. to the modern understanding of cynicism as \\"an attitude of scornful or jaded negativity, especially a general distrust of the integrity or professed motives of others.\\"Cynicism, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. Fourth Edition. 2006. Houghton Mifflin Company. This modern definition of cynicism is in marked contrast to the ancient philosophy, which emphasized \\"virtue and moral freedom in liberation from desire.\\"Bertrand Russell, A History of Western Philosophy, page 231. Simon and Schuster. Influences Various philosophers, such as the Pythagoreans, had advocated simple living in the centuries preceding the Cynics. In the early 6th century BC, Anacharsis, a Scythian sage, had combined plain living together with criticisms of Greek customs in a manner which would become standard among the Cynics.R. Martin, The Scythian Accent: Anacharsis and the Cynics, Perhaps of importance were tales of Indian philosophers, known as gymnosophists, who had adopted a strict asceticism. By the 5th century BC, the sophists had begun a process of questioning many aspects of Greek society such as religion, law and ethics. However, the most immediate influence for the Cynic school was Socrates. Although he was not an ascetic, he did profess a love of virtue and an indifference to wealth,Plato, Apology, 41e. together with a disdain for general opinion.Xenophon, Apology, 1. These aspects of Socrates' thought, which formed only a minor part of Plato's philosophy, became the central inspiration for another of Socrates' pupils, Antisthenes. Symbolisms Cynics were often recognized in the ancient world by their apparel‚Äîan old cloak and a staff. The cloak came as an allusion to Socrates and his manner of dress, while the staff was to the club of Heracles. These items became so symbolic of the Cynic vocation that ancient writers accosted those who thought that donning the Cynic garb would make them suited to the philosophy.Epictetus, 3.22 In the social evolution from the archaic age to the classical, the public ceased carrying weapons into the poleis. Originally it was expected that one carried a sword while in the city; However, a transition to spears, and then to staffs occurred until wearing any weapon in the city became a foolish old custom.Aristotle, Politics (Aristotle): bk 2, 1268b Thus, the very act of carrying a staff was slightly taboo itself. According to modern theorists, the symbol of the staff was one which both functions as a tool to signal the user's dissociation from physical labour, that is, as a display of conspicuous leisure, and at the same time it also has an association with sport and typically plays a part in hunting and sports clothing. Thus, it displays active and warlike qualities, rather than being a symbol of a weak man's need to support himself.Veblen, 1994[1899]: 162Jon Ploug J√∏rgensen, The taming of the aristoi - an ancient Greek civilizing process? History of the Human Sciences: July 2014 vol. 27 no. 3, pg 42-43 The staff itself became a message of how the Cynic was free through its possible interpretation as an item of leisure, but, just as equivalent, was its message of strength - a virtue held in abundance by the Cynic philosopher. Antisthenes The story of Cynicism traditionally begins with Antisthenes (c. 445‚Äì365 BC), who was an older contemporary of Plato and a pupil of Socrates. About 25 years his junior, Antisthenes was one of the most important of Socrates' disciples.Xenophon, Symposium, 4.57‚Äì64. Although later classical authors had little doubt about labelling him as the founder of Cynicism,Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 2 his philosophical views seem to be more complex than the later simplicities of pure Cynicism. In the list of works ascribed to Antisthenes by Diogenes La√´rtius,Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 15‚Äì18 writings on language, dialogue and literature far outnumber those on ethics or politics, although they may reflect how his philosophical interests changed with time. It is certainly true that Antisthenes preached a life of poverty: > I have enough to eat till my hunger is stayed, to drink till my thirst is > sated; to clothe myself as well; and out of doors not [even] Callias there, > with all his riches, is more safe than I from shivering; and when I find > myself indoors, what warmer shirting do I need than my bare walls?Xenophon, > Symposium, 4.34. Diogenes of Sinope J. H. W. Tischbein Diogenes (c. 412‚Äì323 BC) dominates the story of Cynicism like no other figure. He originally went to Athens, fleeing his home city, after he and his father, who was in charge of the mint at Sinope, got into trouble for falsifying the coinage.Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 20‚Äì21 (The phrase \\"defacing the currency\\" later became proverbial in describing Diogenes' rejection of conventional values.)Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 20, 71 Later tradition claimed that Diogenes became the disciple of Antisthenes,Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 6, 18, 21; Aelian, x. 16; Epictetus, Discourses, iii. 22. 63 but it is by no means certain that they ever met. Diogenes did however adopt Antisthenes' teachings and the ascetic way of life, pursuing a life of self-sufficiency (autarkeia), austerity (askƒìsis), and shamelessness (anaideia).Sarton, G., Ancient Science Through the Golden Age of Greece, Dover Publications. (1980). There are many anecdotes about his extreme asceticism (sleeping in a tub),Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 23; Jerome, Adversus Jovinianum, 2.14 his shameless behaviour (eating raw meat),Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 34 and his criticism of conventional society (\\"bad people obey their lusts as servants obey their masters\\"),Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 66 and although it is impossible to tell which of these stories are true, they do illustrate the broad character of the man, including an ethical seriousness. Crates of Thebes Crates of Thebes (c. 365‚Äìc. 285 BC) is the third figure who dominates Cynic history. He is notable because he renounced a large fortune to live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens.Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 87‚Äì88 He is said to have been a pupil of Diogenes,Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 85, 87; Epictetus, Discourses, iii. 22. 63 but again this is uncertain. Crates married Hipparchia of Maroneia after she had fallen in love with him and together they lived like beggars on the streets of Athens,Although there is no mention in ancient sources of them actually begging. Cf. Doyne Dawson, (1992), Cities of the gods: communist utopias in Greek thought, page 135. Oxford University Press where Crates was treated with respect.Plutarch, Symposiacs, 2.1; Apuleius, Florida, 22; Julian, Orations, 6.201b Crates' later fame (apart from his unconventional lifestyle) lies in the fact that he became the teacher of Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism.Diogenes La√´rtius, i. 15, vi. 105, vii. 2, etc The Cynic strain to be found in early Stoicism (such as Zeno's own radical views on sexual equality spelled out in his Republic) can be ascribed to Crates' influence. Other Cynics There were many other Cynics in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, including Onesicritus (who sailed with Alexander the Great to India), the skeptic Monimus, the moral satirist Bion of Borysthenes, the diatribist Teles and Menippus of Gadara. However, with the rise of Stoicism in the 3rd century BC, Cynicism as a serious philosophical activity underwent a decline, and it is not until the Roman era that Cynicism underwent a revival. Cynicism in the Roman world Diogenes Sitting in His Tub (1860) by Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me There is little record of Cynicism in the 2nd or 1st centuries BC; Cicero (c. 50 BC), who was much interested in Greek philosophy, had little to say about Cynicism, except that \\"it is to be shunned; for it is opposed to modesty, without which there can be neither right nor honor.\\"Cicero, De Officiis, i. 41. However, by the 1st century AD, Cynicism reappeared with full force. The rise of Imperial Rome, like the Greek loss of independence under Philip and Alexander three centuries earlier, may have led to a sense of powerlessness and frustration among many people, which allowed a philosophy which emphasized self-sufficiency and inner-happiness to flourish once again. Cynics could be found throughout the empire, standing on street corners, preaching about virtue.Lucian, De Morte Peregrini, 3 Lucian complained that \\"every city is filled with such upstarts, particularly with those who enter the names of Diogenes, Antisthenes, and Crates as their patrons and enlist in the Army of the Dog,\\"Lucian, Fugitivi, 16. and Aelius Aristides observed that \\"they frequent the doorways, talking more to the doorkeepers than to the masters, making up for their lowly condition by using impudence.\\"Aelius Aristides, iii. 654‚Äì694 The most notable representative of Cynicism in the 1st century AD was Demetrius, whom Seneca praised as \\"a man of consummate wisdom, though he himself denied it, constant to the principles which he professed, of an eloquence worthy to deal with the mightiest subjects.\\"Seneca, De Beneficiis, vii. Cynicism in Rome was both the butt of the satirist and the ideal of the thinker. In the 2nd century AD, Lucian, whilst pouring scorn on the Cynic philosopher Peregrinus Proteus,Lucian, De Morte Peregrini. nevertheless praised his own Cynic teacher, Demonax, in a dialogue.Lucian, Demonax. Cynicism came to be seen as an idealised form of Stoicism, a view which led Epictetus to eulogise the ideal Cynic in a lengthy discourse.Epictetus, Discourses, 3. 22. According to Epictetus, the ideal Cynic \\"must know that he is sent as a messenger from Zeus to people concerning good and bad things, to show them that they have wandered.\\"Epictetus, Discourses, 3. 22. 23 Unfortunately for Epictetus, many Cynics of the era did not live up to the ideal: \\"consider the present Cynics who are dogs that wait at tables, and in no respect imitate the Cynics of old except perchance in breaking wind.\\"Epictetus, Discourses, 3. 22. 80 Unlike Stoicism, which declined as an independent philosophy after the 2nd century AD, Cynicism seems to have thrived into the 4th century. The emperor, Julian (ruled 361‚Äì363), like Epictetus, praised the ideal Cynic and complained about the actual practitioners of Cynicism.Julian, Oration 6: To the Uneducated Cynics; Oration 7: To the Cynic Heracleios. The final Cynic noted in classical history is Sallustius of Emesa in the late 5th century.Damascius, Life of Isidorus: fragments preserved in the Commentary on Plato's Parmenides by Proclus, in the Bibliotheca of Photius, and in the Suda. A student of the Neoplatonic philosopher Isidore of Alexandria, he devoted himself to living a life of Cynic asceticism. Cynicism and Christianity Saint Anthony of the Desert, an early Christian ascetic. Early Christian asceticism may have been influenced by Cynicism. Jesus as a Jewish Cynic Some historians have noted the similarities between the teachings of Jesus and those of the Cynics. Some scholars have argued that the Q document, a hypothetical common source for the gospels of Matthew and Luke, has strong similarities to the teachings of the Cynics.Leif Vaage, (1994), Galilean Upstarts: Jesus' First Followers According to Q. TPIF. Gerald Downing, (1992), Cynics and Christian Origins. T. & T. Clark. Scholars on the quest for the historical Jesus, such as Burton L. Mack and John Dominic Crossan of the Jesus Seminar, have argued that 1st- century AD Galilee was a world in which Hellenistic ideas collided with Jewish thought and traditions. The city of Gadara, only a day's walk from Nazareth, was particularly notable as a centre of Cynic philosophy,In particular, Menippus (3rd century BC), Meleager (1st century BC), and Oenomaus (2nd century AD), all came from Gadara. and Mack has described Jesus as a \\"rather normal Cynic-type figure.\\"Quoted in R. Ostling, Who was Jesus?\\", Time, August 15, 1988, pages 37‚Äì42. For Crossan, Jesus was more like a Cynic sage from a Hellenistic Jewish tradition than either a Christ who would die as a substitute for sinners or a messiah who wanted to establish an independent Jewish state of Israel.John Dominic Crossan, (1991), The Historical Jesus: The Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant, Other scholars doubt that Jesus was deeply influenced by the Cynics and see the Jewish prophetic tradition as of much greater importance.Craig A. Evans, Life of Jesus Research: An Annotated Bibliography, page 151. BRILL Cynic influences on early Christianity Many of the ascetic practices of Cynicism may have been adopted by early Christians, and Christians often employed the same rhetorical methods as the Cynics.F. Gasco Lacalle, (1986) Cristianos y cinicos. Una tificacion del fenomeno cristiano durante el siglo II, pages 111‚Äì119. Memorias de Historia Antigua 7. Some Cynics were martyred for speaking out against the authorities.Dio Cassius, Epitome of book 65, 15.5; Herodian, Roman History, 1.9.2‚Äì5 One Cynic, Peregrinus Proteus, lived for a time as a Christian before converting to Cynicism,Lucian, De Morte Peregrini, 10‚Äì15 whereas in the 4th century, Maximus of Alexandria, although a Christian, was also called a Cynic because of his ascetic lifestyle. Christian writers would often praise Cynic poverty,Origen, adv. Cels. 2.41, 6.28, 7.7; Basil of Caesarea, Leg. Lib. Gent. 9.3, 4, 20; Theodoret, Provid. 6; John Chrysostom, Ad. Op. Vit. Monast. 2.4, 5 although they scorned Cynic shamelessness: Augustine stating that they had, \\"in violation of the modest instincts of men, boastfully proclaimed their unclean and shameless opinion, worthy indeed of dogs.\\"Augustine, The ascetic orders of Christianity also had direct connection with the Cynics, as can be seen in the wandering mendicant monks of the early church who in outward appearance, and in many of their practices differed little from the Cynics of an earlier age.

According to the vision of this project the relationship between humans, computers and electronic devices has evolved rapidly, defining technology eras with shifts in the related information technology (IT) business leadership. From the one-to-many relationship ‚Äì computer versus human users ‚Äì in the enterprise during the mainframe era in the 1960s, computers moved to the family environment with the personal computer (PC) in the 1980s. With the mobile phone, they established a personal one-to-one relationship ten years later. The emergence of Ambient Intelligence is consequence of moving to a one-to-many relationship with phone complements, WiFi routers, gaming consoles, MP3 players, set-top boxes (STBs), TVs and infrastructures with impressive computing and storage capabilities. This environment is an enabler for a new concept of global and transversal platform that will exploit the real potential of the network affecting all business areas. In this convergence process, the Ambient Intelligence can be defined as an automated service provider embedding the devices. The Ambient Intelligence platform will be able to personalise itself dynamically in devices according to the context (i.e. physical containers, user needs and environment). The consortium shares the vision of this platform emerging from a community process. The software infrastructure is progressively embedding users in a virtual world. In the long term, everyone will contribute as individual and community playing service-provider and consumer roles. This interaction will lead the evolution of the platform.

It consists exclusively of extracts of old Warner Bros. films, put together and dubbed with new lines so as to create an entirely new film that is a parody of Citizen Kane. Plot The film begins with the following lines appearing on screen, complete with deliberate spelling mistakes: \\"Attention! Ce flim n'est pas un flim sur le cyclimse. Merci de votre compr√©hension.\\" (\\"Attention! This flim is not a flim about cyclign. Thank you for your understanding.\\") The story begins with the death of George Abitbol (John Wayne), described as the \\"Classiest man in the world\\", somewhere near the fictitious atoll of \\"Pom Pom Galli\\" in the \\"South Pacific\\" (a place taken from the Wayne movie The Sea Chase). Reporters Dave (Paul Newman), Peter (Dustin Hoffman) and Steven (Robert Redford) investigate his death by going to meet people who knew him during his life in \\"Tegzas\\". They mostly investigate his last words: \\"Monde de merde\\" (French for \\"Shitty world\\"). Cast Production Warner Bros. had given the French film and television studio Canal+ Group the rights to use extracts of Warner Bros. films. Hazanavicius and M√©zerette set about producing an entire film from cut- and-paste existing footage, and hired the usual French dubbers of John Wayne (Raymond Loyer) and Kirk Douglas (Roger Rudel) to dub them here too.

This movie is a remake of the Telugu film Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana. It was a Shree Venkatesh Films production. The rural scenes shown in this movie were filmed in the original location and set where the Telugu film was filmed at a village near Araku in Andhra Pradesh . Plot Rahul (Dev) is a rich, city boy, born to billionaire parents and brought up in Kolkata. On the other hand, Puja (Payel Sarkar)is a traditional, simple desi girl, from a village of West Bengal who is brought up by her only brother, Indra (Tapas Paul). He is heartbroken when their father marries another woman and throws them out of the house, humiliating them on the way. Their mother dies and her tomb is built on the small land which they own until the zamindar tells them that it is his land, since their mother had taken a loan from the man. Indra volunteers to work day and night, to pay off the loan as long as they don't tear down his mother's tomb. The Zamindar agrees and the local station master helps them. Slowly Indra and Puja grow up. One day, Barsha, Puja's best friend, comes to their house to invite Puja to their house as she is getting married. Barsha's elder brother Rahul also arrives on the same day from UK, finishing his studies. Slowly Rahul and Puja fall in love but Rahul's father does not bear it as Puja is not as rich as them, and is thus not to their standards; Rahul is also to be married to Rahul's father Shantonu Chowdhury's business partner's daughter, Mona. Shantonu Chowdhury humiliates Puja as well as Indra, who arrives a minute before, and both are thrown of the house after Shantonu Chowdhury accuses them of trying to entice and trap Rahul. When Rahul learns of this, he goes to Puja's house and pleads to her brother to accept him. Indra gives him a chance, just like he was given a chance by the Zamindar when he was little. Rahul is tasked to take care of the cows, clean up after them and grow more crops than Indra by the end of the season; if he does not, Rahul will be thrown out of the village and can never see Puja again. A village boy who was beaten up by Indra earlier, he doesn't bear it. With his goons, Mona's father trying to get Rahul to lose the competition, Rahul has to work hard for his love, eating red chillies and rice everyday, even though he can't bear it. Through many antics from the Village goons side and Mona's side, Rahul eventually proves his love for Puja to Indra, and succeeds in growing more grains. However, the village goon kidnaps Puja and then later tries to rape her. A fight takes place in which Rahul kills the goon, Indra, after realizing that Rahul and Puja should be together, takes the blame for this and spends 5 years in prison. The movie ends with Indra's release from prison which is also when Puja and Rahul get married, in everyone's presence. Shantonu Chowdhury also becomes happy to get Puja as daughter-in-law.

(Google) In a charter of Henry de Lacy, 4th Baron of Pontefract, son of Robert, the church is spoken of as dedicated to St. Mary and St. John. These donations were finally confirmed to the monastery by a Bull of Pope Celestine (whether II or III is uncertain), which also conferred certain ecclesiastical privileges on the priory. In the Visitation Records it had 16 monks in 1262, and 27 in 1279. At the latter date a prior of exceptional ability was in charge of the house, and he is commended for his zeal during the twelve years of his rule, which had resulted in a reduction of the monastery's debts from 3200 marks to 350. A later, undated, visitation return gives the average number of monks at 20. DuckettG.F.

In the previous year (1322) Thomas, Earl of Lancaster had been beheaded at Pontefract, and his body buried in the priory church \\"on the right hand of the high altar\\". Rumour declared that miracles had been wrought at the tomb. This attempt to regard the earl as a martyr aroused the anger of Edward II of England, who impounded the offerings.T. Rymer, Foedera, II, ii, 726. However, not long after, a chantry dedicated to St. Thomas was built on the site of the execution and, in 1343, license was given to the prior and Convent of Pontefract \\"to allow Masses and other Divine Services\\" to be celebrated there.

Through its national member organisations and professional federations it represents around 1 million managers in Europe. CEC European Managers is one of the six cross-industry European social partners recognised by the European Commission and takes part in the European Social Dialogue. CEC European Managers'office is based in the European quarter of Brussels.  CEC history  Managers were among the first to understand the importance of organizing themselves on an international level. In 1951 the French, German and Italian executive federations formed the CIC (International Confederation of Managers). In order to participate more actively in the European social dialogue and to be able to have a political influence on the unification process, this international federation founded the European one in 1989. CEC European Managers now unites around 1 million executives, managers and professionals in Europe, through its national organisations and European federations. Since the late 1980s, CEC European Managers has been making its genuine and positive contribution as a social partner to the European integration. Since the Maastricht Treaty, CEC has become an interlocutor for the European Commission and is consulted on new legislative initiatives. Since July 1999 CEC European Managers is part of the employee delegation in the negotiations under the social protocol representing the interests of its members in these negotiations.  Mission  According to CEC European Managers, their mission can be described as follows:  to strive for European integration;  to contribute to find a balance between the economic performance of enterprises and income and social protection for the workforce. We raise awareness about the fact that managers and workers need different degrees of security and flexibility;  to express and defend the needs and opinions of European managers on current topics such as sustainable development, environmental protection, active ageing, energy self-sufficiency, lifelong learning, active ageing, equal opportunities or diversity.  to provide relevant knowledge to managers and policy makers at the cutting edge of leadership and policy research. We take a holistic approach integrating public and private management principles as well as different research traditions;  to contribute to strengthen the quality of European management practices by providing best practices and raising awareness;  to contribute to the debate on the future of public policies from a managerial point of view Managers in Europe and in the World Though legally considered as employees, managers are expected to take over management‚Äôs responsibility for the workers and for the development of the company. Managers assume essential duties which involve responsibilities, competences and professionalism in the management and implementation of corporate and institutional objectives. Leaders of this type share common sociological characteristics and interests. This is why the European Parliament expressly supported managers‚Äô entitlement to a separate and independent representation not only on national but also on European level. This group of employees is steadily increasing with the continuing development of information and communications technologies and of new forms of labour organisation.

The daily strip began earlier that week (October 24, 1938). The McNaught Syndicate was an American newspaper syndicate founded in 1922. It was established by Virgil Venice McNitt (who gave it his name) and Charles V. McAdam. Its best known contents were the columns by Will Rogers and O. O. McIntyre, the Dear Abby letters section and comic strips, including Joe Palooka and Heathcliff. It folded in September 1989. History Virgil McNitt (1881‚Äì1964) first tried his hand at publishing a magazine, the McNaught Magazine, which failed. He then, in 1910, started the Central Press Association syndication service, with offices in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1920, McNitt founded the Central Press Association of New York City. (Although both services had the same name, they were separate operations.)Watson, Elmo Scott. \\"CHAPTER VIII: Recent Developments in Syndicate History 1921-1935,\\" 'History of Newspaper Syndicates. Archived at Stripper's Guide. In 1922, McNitt and Charles V. McAdam (1892‚Äì1985) absorbed the operations of the New York City Central Press Association and co-founded the McNaught Syndicate, with headquarters in The New York Times building. Will Rogers' weekly column started in 1922 in 25 newspapers. By 1926, his daily column ran in 92 newspapers, and it reached 400 papers three years later, making him one of the best paid and most read columnists of the United States at the time. From 1925 until 1951, Charles Benedict Driscoll was one of the editors and contributors for the syndicate. Writers syndicated by McNaught in those first years included Paul Gallico, Dale Carnegie, Walter Winchell and Irvin S. Cobb. By the early 1930s, the McNaught Syndicate had a stable which included columnists O. O. McIntyre and Al Smith and at one time even syndicated a letter by Albert Einstein. Other successes included columns by Dale Carnegie and Dear Abby by Abigail Van Buren. At the time of McNitt's death in 1964, the syndicate was still led by McAdam, providing contents to 1,000 newspapers. By 1987, McNaught had only 24 features left, making it the tenth largest comic strip syndicate in the United States at that time. The syndicate eventually folded in September 1989. Comic strips One of the first syndicated artists was Rube Goldberg. McNaught's line-up of comic strips included Mickey Finn and Dixie Dugan. Ham Fisher's Joe Palooka was at first rejected by McNitt, but Fisher was hired as a salesman for the syndicate, offering McNaught's features to newspapers. After having sold his comic to 20 newspapers, McNitt had to change his opinion and added Joe Palooka to the syndicate, becoming one of the big successes for it. By the mid-1930s, McNaught's stable of cartoonists included Fisher, John H. Striebel, and Gus Mager. In 1933, just as the concept of \\"comic books\\" was getting off the ground, Eastern Color Printing published Funnies on Parade, which reprinted in color several comic strips licensed from the McNaught Syndicate, the Ledger Syndicate, Associated Newspapers, and the Bell Syndicate,\\"Funnies on Parade,\\" Grand Comics Database. Accessed Oct. 29, 2018. including Ham Fisher's Joe Palooka. Eastern Color neither sold this periodical nor made it available on newsstands, but rather sent it out free as a promotional item to consumers who mailed in coupons clipped from Procter & Gamble soap and toiletries products. The company printed 10,000 copies, and it was a great success.Brown, Mitchell. In 1937, the McNaught Syndicate partnered with Frank J. Markey (formerly a McNaught executive)Goulart, Ron. Comic Book Culture: An Illustrated History (Collectors Press, Inc., 2000), p. 85. and the Register and Tribune Syndicate, as well as with entrepreneur Everett M. \\"Busy\\" Arnold, to provide material to the burgeoning comic book industry.Steranko, Jim (1972). The Steranko History of Comics 2. Reading, Pennsylvania: Supergraphics. p. 92. . For this reason, from 1937 until 1939, many of the syndicate's comic strips were reprinted in the comic book anthology Feature Funnies (published by Arnold). In 1939, Cowles Media Company (the Register and Tribune Syndicate's corporate owner) and Arnold bought out the McNaught and Markey interests. In 1939, the syndicate hired Vin Sullivan, then editor of Action Comics, to start a new comics publishing company, Columbia Comics, which would carry both new comics and reprints of McNaught syndicated comics like Joe Palooka. The company existed until 1949 and is best remembered for their publication Big Shot Comics. The syndicate continued columns and strips which were already successful when acquired, but it also was active in creating and suggesting new content, from the Will Rogers columns to comic strips like Don Dean's Cranberry Boggs. In one case, McNitt supported a crossover between the comic strips Joe Palooka and Dixie Dugan, a feat which was commented upon by Editor & Publisher. Their last success came with the comic strip Heathcliff, which they syndicated from the start in 1973 until the late 1980s. Heathcliff appeared in some 1,000 newspapers, and the McNaught Syndicate became the production company for a few Heathcliff movies, including Heathcliff: The Movie from 1986.

In the mid-1950s he was a key proponent and custodian of the comic book censorship guidelines known as the Comics Code Authority. Biography Early life and career Goldwater was born in East Harlem, New York on February 14, 1916 to Jewish parents. \\"His mother died giving birth to him... and his father succumbed to grief, abandoning his baby and dying soon afterward,\\" leaving the orphaned John to be raised by a foster mother, Rose Ettinger. Distantly related to US Senator Barry M. Goldwater, in his youth, the teenage Goldwater hitchhiked his way west during the Depression, leaving \\"New York, hopping freight trains and bumming rides to the Midwest, where he worked for a time in Kansas as a news reporter. Assigned to school sports, he hung around with football teams, meeting the players and the girls they attracted, who would later supply him with ample comic material.\\" Goldwater had hitchhiked to the community at the age of 17 and started working at the Hiawatha Daily World. He said that he got fired by publisher Ewing Herbert Sr. after a scrap involving the daughter of the newspaper's biggest advertiser. http://www.hiawathaworldonline.com/news/hiawatha-revealed-as-a-city-of- archie-s/article_f98ccc77-86bc-515e-9945-a1f011b951b4.html A few years later, \\"he continued west to the Grand Canyon, where he worked at a lodge,\\" from which he was dismissed for \\"socializing with the female help.\\" His employers paid for him to travel to San Francisco, where he saved enough money (again working as a reporter) to travel by ship back to New York. On the boat, \\"he met two young women bound for the novitiate... [b]oth fell for him, which later gave him the idea of the Betty-Veronica rivalry.\\" MLJ Comics Arriving back in New York, he gained employment at the docks, where his \\"experience with shipping\\" inspired him to both start his own company ‚Äî Periodicals for Export, Inc. ‚Äî and strike a deal with pulp/magazine publisher Louis Silberkleit to \\"buy his outdated issues at a penny each,\\" which he then re-sold abroad.\\"Publisher Profile: Archie Comics\\" By Rik Offenberger, from Borderline #19 (March 1, 2003). Retrieved July 8, 2008. Finding success in his venture, Goldwater was soon joined by Silberkleit and Maurice Coyne to form their own publishing venture MLJ Comics (named after the first initial of each of the three individuals). Silberkleit and Coyne, with (Timely/Marvel's) Martin Goodman, were among the earliest publishers of pulp magazines with their Columbia Publications publishing house, and others. In addition to having bought stock from them for his Periodicals for Export venture, Goldwater worked alongside the two of them for Paul Sampliner, Jack Liebowitz and Harry Donenfeld's Independent News, the distribution arm of National Periodicals, forerunner of DC Comics. Inspired by the success of National's Superman and Batman (and hot on the heels of Goodman's Timely Comics publications), Goldwater and company published their first comic ‚Äî Blue Ribbon Comics #1 ‚Äî in November 1939, and soon after, in his role as editor, Goldwater helped devise the Shield (created by MLJ writer/editor Harry Shorten) as star of Pep Comics, the Black Hood (also created by Shorten) for Top-Notch Comics, and Steel Sterling in Zip Comics.\\" Archie Comics Interviewed for the book The Best of Archie (1980), Goldwater recalls that he \\"thought of Superman as an abnormal individual and concluded that the antithesis, a normal person, could be just as popular,\\" so \\"in 1941, just as the war was restricting paper supplies,\\" the fledgling company began publishing such a character in the pages of Pep Comics #22: Archie Andrews. According to Goldwater, in 1941, Goldwater, \\"inspired by the popular 'Andy Hardy' movies starring Mickey Rooney\\", \\"dreamed up the carrot-topped, freckle-faced character perpetually torn between two loves, one blond, one dark. He was a hapless teen-age Everyman counterpoised to the hyperpotent Superman, who had made his debut just a few years earlier.\\" Calling the character Archie, the name echoing that of a schoolfriend, Goldwater and series writer/artist Bob Montana surrounded him with a cast supposedly \\"patterned after teen-agers he [Goldwater] had met in the Midwest.\\" Other sources give Montana credit for creating the main Archie characters (Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper, Jughead Jones, Veronica Lodge and Reggie Mantle).Tennant, Paul. \\"'Archie' comic changes with the times, examines real-life topics,\\" The Eagle-Tribune (Dec. 28, 2010). Success The success of the Archie line of comics, thought Goldwater, was because At its peak, the Archie comic strip ran in 750 newspapers, while comics sales continue to sell millions of copies each year (from a height of c. 50 million) through grocery stores and newsvendors as well as tailored comics shops - Archie Comics' output is among the few still carried by the full range of venues. The Archie line of comics (and related items) gave Goldwater a \\"multimillion-dollar fortune and publishing empire, Archie Comic Publications Inc. of Mamaroneck, N.Y.,\\" a major rival to the comics industry's Superhero houses Marvel and DC Comics. Archie would feature not just in comic books and newspaper strips, but on radio, television and in film, as well as having his own \\"short-lived chain of Archie restaurants.\\" Goldwater ran Archie Comics until his retirement in 1983.South Coast Today: Obituaries 28 February 1999. Retrieved September 5, 2008. The Comics Code In 1954, with a public outcry against comics building on Fredric Wertham's book Seduction of the Innocent and the Estes Kefauver-led United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency hearings, Goldwater helped found the \\"Comics Magazine Association of America, whose Comics Code Authority persuaded magazines to voluntarily weed out offensive copy as well as ads for guns, knives and war weapons.\\" Goldwater served as president of the Comics Magazine Association for 25 years, personally decrying such events as the 1971 United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare-sanctioned Spider-Man storyline dealing with the problems of drug addiction, which‚Äî while talking of the evils of drugs‚Äî still violated the code's guidelines by mentioning them at all. As a consequence, Marvel Comics writer and editor Stan Lee decided to defy the CCA and ran the offending story without the seal, to considerable public approval, which discredited the organization.Thompson, Don & Maggie, \\"Crack in the Code\\" in Newfangles #44 (February, 1971) Other roles Goldwater also found time to serve as President of the New York Society for the Deaf, and was actively involved as a National Commissioner of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, for \\"more than 50 years.\\" In a 1999 notice placed in the New York Times, he was described as a \\"Poet Laureate, listed in [The] Who's Who of America,\\" and a member of both the \\"Old Oaks Country Club and the Friars Club.\\" Later life In 1973, Goldwater \\"licens[ed] Archie for evangelical Christian messages,\\" despite his personal Jewish faith, feeling that the \\"sentiments were in line with his wholesome family message.\\" The comics were written and illustrated by one of the Archie regulars, Al Hartley, and were published by Spire Christian Comics. Ten years later, after Goldwater's retirement, the then-publicly traded Archie Comics company was acquired by Richard Goldwater (his son) and Silberkleit's son Michael, returning it to private ownership. In 2009, Goldwater's son, Jonathan, and Michael Silberkleit's widow, Nancy, were named co-CEO's of Archie Comics. Death Goldwater died in New York on February 26, 1999, and was survived by his second wife and three sons: Richard (from his first marriage), Jonathan and Jared. He was also described as a \\"devoted brother of Dorothy Glaser and the late Jack.\\" Donations were invited in his honor to the Anti-Defamation League.

History The origins of the School can be traced back to 1975 when Professor Martin Davies was brought from Manchester to design and launch a new Graduate Programme in Social Work. As a result, UEA welcomed its first 12 social work students in 1976. The School grew steadily, originally operating as a sector of the School of Economic and Social Studies. A new research degree was launched in 1983, and the School's first doctoral student graduated in 1984. In the late 1980s there began a series of collaborations with local authority and probation departments in East Anglia which lay the foundations for a burgeoning programme of postqualifying courses in social work. In 1993 the School performed a key role in the development of health studies at UEA in the formation of the School of Health and Social Work. To support the development the Elizabeth Fry Building was built, which has been occupied by all social work and psychosocial sciences staff and students since January 1995. The School of Social Work became an entity in its own right in 1997 and was renamed the School of Social Work and Psychosocial Sciences in 2000, changing to the School of Social Work and Psychology in 2008 in recognition of the British Psychological Society approval of the BSc Psychology (formerly psychosocial sciences) degree programme. The School is also home to the Centre for Research on Children and Families. Launched in 1996, the Centre provides a focus for internationally recognised research in this field. In 2006 the Centre hosted the Second International Conference on Adoption Research and the First International Conference on Children and Divorce, attracting delegates from all around the world. In 1989, 1992, 1996 and most recently in December 2001, the School's research was recognised by the Higher Education Funding Council when social work at UEA was top-rated 5 on each occasion in the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE). External funding for research has been awarded by a range of organisations including the UK and Welsh Government, Economic and Social Research Council, NSPCC, Nuffield Foundation, and the Big Lottery. The quality of the teaching received by social work students was also given the highest possible ranking by the Funding Council. This was consolidated in the first ever National Student Survey in 2005 where students on the School's undergraduate programme ranked gave the course the best ranking for courses of its kind in the whole UK, a result which was repeated in the 2006 and 2007 National Student Survey. The undergraduate Psychology programme (formerly Psychosocial Sciences) was launched in 1997, with the first cohort of students graduating in July 2000. The programme provided a new undergraduate degree focusing on the scientific study of human relations in a social context. The programme was able to draw on the teaching and research skills of existing members of faculty and to attract new appointments to strengthen the School's expertise in psychology. The BSc Psychology at UEA achieved accreditation from the British Psychological Society in 2008. In 2012, the School was split to form two separate Schools: the School of Psychology and the School of Social Work.

Porter, produced by Adolph Zukor. The movie stars Pauline Frederick in her debut film role, The production is based upon the 1901 novel and 1902 Broadway play of the same name by Hall Caine that starred Viola Allen and Frederic De Belleville. Much of The Eternal City was shot on location in England and Italy before being interrupted by the start of the Great War. The film was released through the specially created Select Film Booking Agency for the Famous Players Film Company. The Eternal City is now considered lost. It was remade as in 1923, directed by George Fitzmaurice and starring Barbara La Marr, Bert Lytell, and Lionel Barrymore. Plot The wife of Leone, a member of the Papal Guard, believing herself to have been deserted, leaves her young son David with the Sisters of Charity and commits suicide. Little David is brought up by the sisters, and turned over to a Padrone, who takes him to London and mistreats him. David is befriended by Dr. Roselli, a political exile, and becomes the playmate of Roma, the doctor's daughter. He assumes the name of Rosa. Years later Roma becomes Baron Bonelli's ward, and is supposed to have become his mistress. David is a socialist agitator, and is particularly passionate in denouncing the baron, who is also the prime minister of Italy. The baron arranges to have David killed, but Roma saves him. Later she is induced to betray him through lying promises of clemency for her husband. David thinks Roma has betrayed him intentionally. He kills the baron, and Roma assumes the blame for the crime. David befriended by the pope, discovers he is his father, and through the popes, influence Roma is freed and reunited to her husband.

Albert Hall - Prosecuting Attorney Production The film was shot on location in London and at the Roman Forum, the Colosseum, and the Vatican gardens in Rome, Italy. Production was interrupted by World War I, and the remainder of the film was shot in New York City. The $100,000 budget was the most costly Famous Players had attempted. According to Adolf Zukor, Edwin S. Porter reached a new high with his camera work. One long scene showed Thomas Holding as David Rossi, pleading with Fuller Mellish as the pope during a walk in the Vatican gardens. Unfortunately Holding clutched Mellish‚Äôs arm. After the company returned they learned that no one was allowed to touch the pope in such a manner. It was possible that Catholics might take offence. Hall Caine had been an adversary of the Catholic Church which complicated the matter further. The film was in trouble. A ban by the Catholic church risked putting Famous Players out of business. As much as possible of the offending scene was cut but some had to stay. There only other option was to postpone the release and send the company back to Rome. By this time, extensive distribution plans had been made. Zukor called on Bishop, later Cardinal Hayes and explained their innocent mistake. Hayes was sympathetic, and the film was released. Afterwards Zukor and Hayes became good friends, often discussing the moral and religious implications of the film. Release The Eternal City had its first showing at the Lyceum theatre on 27 December 1914 and was given a run at the Lyceum. The film was not released on the Paramount Film Corporation program as was usual. Famous Players created the Select Booking Agency to distribute initially The Eternal City and other prestigious feature-length films before being turned over to Paramount. Hall Caine cabled the producers after attending the British premiere at Marble Arch Pavilion to congratulate them. ‚ÄúIt follows my story with an exactness that is remarkable. The pictures of The Eternal City convey just the idea and infuse just the atmosphere that I strove to impart to the book. I am delighted with the film and I only hope that those who see it in the picture theatre will derive as much pleasure as I myself did‚Äù. The film was re-released in 1918 as part of the Paramount \\"Success Series\\". The Canadian Board of Censors barred the film from the province of Quebec on the grounds that the story of David Leone, the foundling son of Pope Pius XI, would prove offensive to the majority Roman Catholics. Reception By the time The Eternal City opened at the Astor Theatre in New York on 12 April 1915, it was proclaimed to be one of the foremost features produced in the United States. Kinematograph Weekly said in part: ‚ÄúWe congratulate the Famous Players Film Company upon the complete and signal success of their effort in every way, for the production stands out as one of the best that has been submitted for public approval. It is a real classic in picture production, and words are inadequate to thoroughly express our full and emphatic admiration of the subject, which we are convinced will meet with as hearty a reception from the public as any previous subject has yet employed.‚Äù The Bioscope wrote \\"Thanks to its makers The Eternal City is a production planned and executed on a grand scale. In Mr. Caine‚Äôs novel the producers had a story giving the utmost scope for spectacular display and scenic ornamentation. They determined to make the very best of their material.\\" References External links American movie herald or lobby card (archived) *Italian theatre advert 1915 films 1915 drama films American drama films American films American silent feature films American black-and-white films Famous Players-Lasky films Films based on British novels American films based on plays Films shot in London Films shot in Rome Films shot in New York City Lost American films Films based on multiple works 1915 lost films Lost drama films ","title":"The Eternal City (1915 film)"},{"id":"19187447","text":"Sound of the Desert () is a 1932 Polish romantic film adventure directed by Micha≈Ç Waszy≈Ñski.G≈Ços pustyni at the Internet Polish Movie Database Cast *Nora Ney ...

With 150 of their own killed, the Syrians retaliated against the Lebanese for deviating against the \\"rules of war\\". Newilati, who indicates that then Defense Minister of Lebanon Albert Mansour described the event as a \\"double massacre\\", states that the corpses he found a day after the event had been \\"shot in the head while their hands were tied to their backs\\", most unclothed.

He was born Rafael Franco Sotomayor in Guayaquil in the house of his great-aunt and uncle. His father, Alfredo Franco Ricaurte, was born in Bogot√°, who immigrated to Guayaquil to work at the Commercial and Agricultural Bank. In 1935 his father moved back to Colombia. His mother, Esther Sotomayor y Sotomayor, was from Vinces. He was the youngest of five siblings. In 1939, his sister Leonor developed a limp that doctors diagnosed as rheumatism. They tried living for a year to Salinas for the better climate, but in 1941 their mother decided to take Leonor to Baltimore for treatment and sent the other four children to live to Bogot√° to live with their father. In 1942, Leonor successfully underwent surgery in New York City, and their mother decided to stay in the United States. Rafael Aguilar was educated first at Colegio San Jos√© La Salle, where he picked up languages easily and excelled in French. In 1944, he and his siblings were reunited in New York City, where he attended Cardinal Spellman High School. He worked various jobs, working for a restaurant and messaging service, while enjoying the cosmopolitan lifestyle of Manhattan. He attended the opera frequently and learned to speak some Italian and Arabic from his neighbors, and considered becoming a diplomat. To prepare for this career, in 1947 he moved to Belgium to study international law at the University of Louvain. On weekends, however, he would travel to Paris, where he learned to dance flamenco, and was encouraged to study dance. At age 20, he began his dance training in London, studying at the Royal Ballet School from 1948‚Äì50. He worked with greats including L√©onide Massine and John Taras, and decided his future lay in the world of dance. Rafael, who already had an effeminate nature not appreciated by his family, was told to change his surname by his brother Jorge, who was embarrassed that his brother would become a ballet dancer. In Paris in 1951, he met Spanish dancer Manuela Aguilar, who owned a small flamenco company. He joined her company and began his choreography career, creating avant-garde dances that brought new life to flamenco. He married Manuela and moved to Spain, where he changed his name from Franco to Aguilar‚Äîa decision undertaken to avoid any associations with Francoism rather than to honor his brother's request. In 1960, they founded the Ballet Teatro Espanol de Rafael Aguilar. For many years he created many outstanding productions, mainly flamenco themed. His wife devoted herself to studying gypsy culture and integrated many gypsy dances into their choreography as well. The highlight of his career was in 1992, when he was awarded the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Theatre Choreographer for the West End musical Matador. Illness and death In July 1994, Aguilar began suffering severe headaches while touring Germany, and he was subsequently diagnosed with brain cancer. He underwent six weeks of radiation treatment at the Hospital of Madrid, where defective equipment burned the skin on his skull. He then went to the hospital of the Red Cross, where he improved after a course of chemotherapy. He was still weak but returned to work in time for the opening night of his production of Bol√©ro in Madrid on 3 March 1995, when he suffered a heart attack and died. Manuela died in 1998.

History Formed in 1963 by a group of teachers and old pupils from Shipston High School, the first squad came from wide across the region. During their first season, the 'Rams' were forced to be a nomadic club with no pitch of their own to use. Instead they relied on the facilities at the school and using some local pubs for post-match refreshments. In 1964 they were able to regularly put out two teams and with the help of a local farmer, had a pitch of their own to use. Located in the nearby village of Darlingscote the pitch soon became known as 'The Bowl'. By 1968 they were renting an old barn at the rear of The Bell Inn on Sheep Street and with the assistance of Whitbread Flowers they were able to use this structure as a club house. The club moved again in 1973 but with the help of the town's local inhabitants, the local council, the County Council, the RFU, Middlesex RFU and the players themselves a new plan for a Clubhouse and ground at Mayo Road was created. The club moved yet again in 2000 although this time they stayed based at Mayo Road and moved next door to a purpose- built club house that had been funded with finance from a Sport England lottery grant. The club now runs four senior teams, a Veterans team, Colts team as well as Mini and Junior Rugby at eight different age groups. The 2002 season saw the first team run out at Twickenham for the Powergen Junior Vase Final.

As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, and of the House of Orl√©ans, Philippine √âlisabeth was a Princesse du Sang. She died of smallpox at the age of nineteen. Biography Philippine √âlisabeth Charlotte d'Orl√©ans was born at the Palace of Versailles. She was the fifth living daughter of her parents and was known as Mademoiselle de Beaujolais in her youth. Brought up in a convent with her younger sister, Louise Diane d'Orl√©ans, she grew up in the era of the R√©gence. She was named after her paternal grandparents, Philippe de France and Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate. She was one of eight children. Her paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate was warmly attached to her granddaughter and very devoted to her; she used to visit her almost every day at the Palais- Royal in Paris. Her maternal grandmother was Madame de Montespan, who had died in 1707, seven years before the birth of Philippine. Betrothal Infante Charles, Jean Ranc, 1724. Since 1715, Philippine √âlisabeth's father was de facto ruler of France as the Regent for the child King Louis XV of France. In 1718, the War of the Quadruple Alliance broke out between France and Spain. In 1720, King Philip V of Spain wanted to make peace and proposed a triple marriage; his three-year-old daughter, Infanta Mariana Victoria, would marry the fifteen-year-old Louis XV, and his sons, Infante Louis and Infante Charles, would marry two of the Regent's daughters. Philippine would marry Infante Carlos, the younger of Philip V's sons. Her future husband was expected to become the ruler of Tuscany as his half brother Louis was the heir to the throne of Spain being his father's first son. The dowry, much like that of her older sister the Princess of Asturias amounted to 400,000 ecus given by the King of France, 40,000 by her father, and 50,000 in jewels by the King of Spain. There were also many gifts from the King Louis XV. The Regent and the Duke of Chartres travelled with her as far as Bourg-la-Reine, as they had done with Louise √âlisabeth the year before. She was also escorted by her half- brother Jean Philippe d'Orl√©ans. She arrived at Buitrago del Lozoya, a day's journey from Madrid; it was there that she met the royal family including King Felipe, Queen Isabel, her sister, the Prince of Asturias and her husband to be, Infante Carlos. Elisabeth Farnese later wrote to the Regent and his wife: > \\" I believe, that you will not be displeased to learn of her first interview > with her little husband. They embraced very affectionately and kissed one > another, and it appears to me that he does not displease her. Thus, since > this evening they do not like to leave one another. She says a hundred > pretty things; one would not credit the things that she says, unless one > heard them. She has the mind of an angel, and my son is only too happy to > possess her. . . . She has charged me to tell you that she loves you with > all her heart, and that she is quite content with her husband.\\" And to the > duchesse d'Orl√©ans she writes : \\"I find her the most beautiful and most > lovable child in the world. It is the most pleasing thing imaginable to see > her with her little husband : how they caress one another and how they love > one another already. They have a thousand little secrets to tell one > another, and they cannot part for an instant.\\" Jacques Rigaud. The relationship with her sister, which had never been good, became more sour due to the young Philippine gaining all the attention of the Spanish court for her beauty and intelligence; something which never happened to Louise √âlisabeth upon her arrival to the cold and formal Spanish court. Her engagement with Charles was later dissolved, so she was called back to France in 1728. The departure of Philippine was seen as a sad affair, unlike that of her older sister Louise √âlisabeth who had never been popular at the court. The Dowager Queen and Mademoiselle de Beaujolais arrived at the frontier of France at the foot of the Pyrenees mountains at Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port. Onward they traveled, and despite what was expected, the two girls were unable to enter the town of Bayonne because their cousin, Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon (and the Prime Minister) had failed to send orders to secure lodgings for his younger cousins. Their mother was obliged to send orders to make a suite of rooms at the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes where they arrived in June. When her former fianc√© became the Duke of Parma in 1731, the hopes of Philippine and her mother were revived into thinking that a marriage was still possible. Her mother approached the marquis de Bissy, who was the ambassador of France in Parma. Information that the Dowager Duchess of Orl√©ans gained was that he had been faithful and that he had treasured a ring that had been given to him by Philippine. With the encouragement of the Duchess of Orl√©ans, de Bissy went to Charles himself and asked him his thoughts on a possible re-uniting of the young couple. The new sovereign Duke said that he had wanted to marry young Philippine and he said to the Parmese minister to use any measure possible to secure his love's hand. The minister later said that he could not consent to help until he saw that there was no hostility on the side of Spain. In 1733, the War of the Polish Succession broke out and caused international relations to shift. This war later made Charles the ruler of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Despite that, Philippine did not see the day her love would become the King; while living quietly at her mother's favourite residence, the Ch√¢teau de Bagnolet in Bagnolet, she died of smallpox at the age of nineteen. Upon her death, the French writer Matthieu Marais wrote to President Bouhier: > \\" Everybody is in tears, and I also; she was a charming princess.\\"M√©moires > int√©ressants sur les premi√®res ann√©es du r√®gne de Louis XV by Matthieu > Marais She was buried at the Val-de-Gr√¢ce convent in Paris on the day after she died.

It is one of twenty-four towns and villages located in the Khanasir valley, an area with a population of 11,000 people. History Khanasir is the administrative center of Nahiya Khanasir of the as-Safira District. The town is mentioned by Pliny the Elder as \\"Chenneseri\\"; the etymology of Khanasir does not exist in Aramaic, and an Arabic etymology is unlikely (an implausible one being \\"Khinsar\\" which mean \\"the little finger\\"). An Akkadian etymology is also possible, with the name deriving from the word \\"Hunsiru\\", a variant of the word \\"Humsiru\\" meaning a rat or a mouse.Astour, Eblaitica (a reconstruction of the history of Ebla) 2002, p. 119. During the Byzantine era, the town was known as Anasartha, enclosed within ramparts in western Syria; Malalas records that it was a kastron (fortified hilltop settlement) that was designated a polis by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I. A qanat dating back to Byzantine times that served as the water source for the village remained operational well into the 20th century. According to Robert L. France, Byzantine-era remains of Anasartha \\"are visible on the street, in newly built walls, and inside residential houses,\\" in Khanasir today. Anasartha and its surrounding villages enjoyed a period of prosperity between the late 4th century and early 6th century. The vast majority of the houses and churches discovered in this region are of that period. The church in Anasartha itself dates from 426.Kennedy, 2006, p. 165. Its bishop Maras took part in the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and his successor Cyrus was a signatory of the letter that the bishops of the province sent in 458 to the Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian to protest about the killing of Proterius of Alexandria.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 787-788Sim√©on Vailh√©, v. Anasartha, in Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de G√©ographie eccl√©siastiques, vol. II, Paris 1914, col. 1439 Another bishop built a \\"refuge\\" in neighbouring Buz al-Khanzir in 506-507.Kennedy, 2006, p. 166. No longer a residential bishopric, Anasartha is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 832 Khanasir, known to the early Arabs as \\"Khunasira\\", became a fortified estate and frequent residence of the Umayyad caliph Umar II ().

While the Byzantine-era qanat ceased to supply water to the village after the construction of pump wells in the area west of the Khanasir valley in 1975, the -long structure was described by Hamid√© in 1959 as discharging 8 litres per second, irrigating a land area of .France, 2007, p. 244. On 23 February 2016, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that ISIL had captured the town which is located along a major road and supply route to the city of Aleppo. Two days later, the Syrian Army managed to recapture the town back from ISIL. Archaeology Anasartha is the site of a number of inscriptions into stone, or epigraphs. For example, there is an inscription dated to 425 which marks the burial place of Queen Mavia, the leader of Tanukh tribal confederation who mounted a revolt against Roman rule in the late 4th century.Ball, 2001, pp. 98-102. Inscriptions dating to the late 6th and early 7th centuries include one on a lintel which reads: > By the gifts of (his) majesty (the) city, despising the inroad of the > barbarians, set up at its gates its benefactors, (the) Saviour Christ, (her) > gloriously victorious sovereigns, (the) renowned (commander), the prefects > of the praetorium, also ? its most holy bishop, (and the?) most glorious > engineer, in the month Gorpieos (September), in the 906th (?) year, > indiction 13. + Jesus Christ, Emmanuel. + God over all.Greatrex and Lieu, > 2002, pp. 244, 245. Another inscription found on the gate to the city, reads: > \\\\+ (Phocas) and Leontia, our most pious sovereigns, O Lord protect! + A > pious branch that sprang from noble stock, Gregory, the renowned, and > adorned with the fruits of his virtue, presented to God this wall also, in > sparing his own country (the expense). Indiction 8, in the 916th year. Geoffrey Greatrex and Samuel N. C. Lieu write that building work continued in Anasartha in the seventh century and that these epigraphs provide evidence of Roman resistance to Persian invasions. Climate A marginal dryland environment, the rainy season in Khanasir falls between October and May with an average annual rainfall of 210 millimetres. Variability between years is high, with 50% of the years between 1929 and 2004 receiving over , and 25% receiving over . July and August are the hottest months with an average daily maximum temperature of . The lowest average daily minimum temperature is in January. While the temperature can fall below at night in November and December, it hardly ever remains that low throughout the day. Economy Like the rest of the villagers of the Khanasir valley, those living in Khanasir derive their income from diverse sources, with the majority working either as agriculturalists, pastoralists, or land-poor labourers. Agriculturalists make a per capita income of US$1.30 to $2 per day, supplementing their income from the growing of crops with the fattening of animals and waged labour. Some 40% of the residents of the Khanasir valley are agriculturalists and this sub- section of the population comprises the major land-owning group in the area. Pastoralists and herders migrate, earning a per capita income of $1 to 1.50 per day and often take up fattening to supplement their incomes. Land-poor labourers own some land, between and , but make their income by working on the land of others, earning less than $1 per day. References Bibliography France, Robert L (2007).

In Korean, galbi means rib. But Dak-galbi is not actually chicken's rib. Many dak-galbi restaurants have round hot plates that are built into the tables. Lettuce and perilla leaves are served as ssam (wrap) vegetables.  History and etymology  Although dak and galbi translate into \\"chicken\\" and \\"rib\\" respectively, the term dak-galbi does not refer to chicken ribs. This dish was developed in the 1960s as grilled chicken-pieces, an inexpensive anju accompaniment to alcoholic drinks in small taverns on the outskirts of Chuncheon. It replaced the comparatively expensive gui dishes which were grilled over charcoal. Dak-galbi spread to Chuncheon's main districts, where the livestock industry was thriving and offered fresh ingredients with no need for refrigeration. As a relatively cheap dish served in large portions, it gained popularity with soldiers and students on a budget and earned the nickname \\"commoners' galbi \\" or \\"university student's galbi \\" in the 1970s. The dish is a local specialty of Chuncheon, and is often referred to as Chuncheon-dak-galbi. An annual festival dedicated to dak-galbi is held in Chuncheon, where there is also a dak-galbi alley with a large number of dak-galbi restaurants.

L'Alezane was purchased as a yearling by prominent Quebec businessman and major Thoroughbred racing stable owner, Jean-Louis Levesque. Conditioned for racing by future Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame trainer Yonnie Starr, at age two L'Alezane followed a similar path as owner Levesque's U.S & Canadian Hall of Fame filly La Prevoyante had undertaken three years earlier by competing in both Canada and the United States. A winner of three important stakes races in each country, L'Alezane's 1977 performances earned her the Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Filly title, and joined La Prevoyante in being voted Canadian Horse of the Year honors. Much was expected of L'Alezane at age three but she did not achieve the results anticipated. Although she did win the Selene Stakes, she finished second in Canada's top race for three-year-old fillies, the Woodbine Oaks, and was third in a field with colts in her country's most prestigious race, the Queen's Plate.

It began life in 1973 when Anthony Boobier discovered there were no specialist autism services for his newly diagnosed son. Its first establishment (Doucecroft School) opened in 1977 and it opened adult services in 1983 when the original children grew up and it was realised that there was no specialised adult autism provision for them. In 2008, The Essex Autistic Society took over the Norfolk Autistic Community Housing Association and the Norfolk Autistic Society and changed the name of the new charity to Autism Anglia to better reflect the enlarged area of operation.http://www.autism-anglia.org.uk/ In 2013 Autism Anglia took over the Cambridge-based charity East Anglian Autistic Support Trust (EAST). Its head office is in Colchester, Essex, and it has local offices in Dereham, Norfolk. Autism Anglia provides education, care and support to people with autism from all across the United Kingdom. It also provides Further Education services, Adult Residential, Supported Living, Outreach and Family Support. In October 2007, with encouragement and support from the three county police forces, Autism Anglia introduced an Alert Card scheme in Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk. The card provides an easy and discrete way of explaining the holder's possibly unusual behaviour. In March 2009 the scheme was extended into Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire with the support of the local police forces. The cards are designed to be easily identifiable to emergency services and offer some simple advice, the person's name and emergency contact details. Either directly through its schools, adult residential homes, adult day centres, supported living, outreach services or indirectly through its family support teams, Autism Anglia now provides help to over 5,000 people with autism and their families in East Anglia. It also provides training and support to police and other emergency services to develop a better understanding of autism spectrum conditions.  Fundraising Events  In March of each year, the charity runs its Silly Sock Day, in which fundraisers adorn their silliest socks for the charity.

There are many different designs of bungee trampolines, but most operate in the same fashion. The participant puts on a bungee trampoline harness and is then hooked to several bungee ropes. Those ropes are attached to poles or bars reaching an average of fifteen feet above the trampoline platform. As the participant jumps higher and higher the bungee ropes are moved up the poles allowing the participant to reach heights and do flips and other maneuvers that would otherwise be impossible on a regular trampoline. A bungee trampolineTrampoline Safety Guide is a mechanical amusement attraction which contains a support structure of 3 to 8 m in height or 10 to 26 feet, a pulley system to anchor and retract bungee cords, a trampoline the jumper will bounce on, a harness to attach the jumper to the cords and structure, and a winch‚Äîeither electric or manual‚Äîto put tension on the bungee cords by pulling on them through the pulleys. Bungee trampolines are used at fairs, malls, summer-winter camps, at the beach, and for amusement and birthday party rentals. Some cruise ships have bungee trampolines on board. Even mountain resorts (including ski resorts that use other attractions in the \\"summer season\\") started using them as attractions. There are different models that range in ease of use and also in ease of setup. Some are on trailers and have single trampoline mats, some are doubles, and then there are the four, five and six versions. All bungee Trampolines operate under the same principle. The participant puts on a bungee trampoline harness according to their waist size, and depending on the person's weight they hooked to the relative number of bungee ropes. Those ropes connect to a climbing rope which goes through a pulley system connected to the highest point on the jump structure and after connecting to an electric winch or manual winch. As the participant gains momentum, the operator puts more tension on the bungee ropes by using the hand controller to re-coil the winch and retract the rope, allowing the participant to reach heights as high as the structure or higher and do flips and other maneuvers that would otherwise be impossible on a regular trampoline for untrained people. There are hydraulic models along with winch models depending on the age and manufacturer of the unit. Recently bungee trampolines have also been combined with spider towers, zip-lines, rock climbing walls, and other amusement equipment, to offer more entertainment options. This include EuroBungy, in which the trampoline is not needed. Despite that however, they are still often added for extra height.
