India is a federal republic with three spheres of government: central, state and local. The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments give recognition and protection to local governments and in addition each state has its own local government legislation. Since 1992, local government in India (bala)takes place in two very distinct forms. Urban localities, covered in the 74th amendment to the Constitution,The Constitution (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992 have Nagar Palika but derive their powers from the individual state governments, while the powers of rural localities have been formalized under the panchayati raj system, under the 73rd amendment to the Constitution.The Constitution (Seventy-third Amendment) Act, 1992 For the history of traditional local government in India and South Asia, see panchayati raj. As of 2017, there are a total of 267,428 local government bodies, of which 262,771 are rural and 4,657 urban. Of the rural local governments, 632 are zila parishads at the district level, 6,672 are panchayat samitis at the block level, and 255,466 are gram panchayats at the village level. Following the 2013 local election, 37.1% of councillors were women, and in 2015/16 local government expenditure was 16.3% of total government expenditure. The panchayati raj system is a three-tier system with elected bodies at the village, taluk and district levels. The modern system is based in part on traditional {Panchayati raj. Panchayat governance}, in part on the vision of (Mahatma Gandhi) and in part by the work of various committees to harmonize the highly centralized Indian governmental administration with a degree of local autonomy. The result was intended to create greater participation in local government by people and more effective implementation of rural development programs. Although, as of 2015, implementation in all of India is not complete,the intention is for there to be a gram panchayat for each village or group of villages, a tehsil level council, and a zilla panchayat at the district level. Rural local governments (or panchayat raj institutions): * Zilla panchayats * Mandal or taluka panchayats * Gram panchayats In 1957, a committee led by Balwant Rai Mehta Committee studied the Community Development Projects and the National Extension Service and assessed the extent to which the movement had succeeded in utilising local initiatives and in creating institutions to ensure continuity in the process of improving economic and social conditions in rural areas. The Committee held that community development would only be deep and enduring when the community was involved in the planning, decision-making and implementation process.Government of India, Report of the Team for the Study of Community Projects and National Extension Service, (Chairperson: Balvantray Mehta), Committee on Plan Projects, National Development Council, (New Delhi, November 1957), Vol. I, The suggestions were for as follows:Anirban Kashyap: Panchaytiraj, Views of founding fathers and recommendation of different committees, New Delhi, Lancer Books, 1989 P 109 *an early establishment of elected local bodies and devolution to them of necessary resources, power, and authority, *that the basic unit of democratic decentralisation was at the block/samiti level since the area of jurisdiction of the local body should neither be too large nor too small. The block was large enough for efficiency and economy of administration, and small enough for sustaining a sense of involvement in the citizens, *such body must not be constrained by too much control by the government or government agencies, *the body must be constituted for five years by indirect elections from the village panchayats, *its functions should cover the development of agriculture in all its aspects, the promotion of local industries and others *services such as drinking water, road building, etc., and *the higher-level body, Zilla Parishad, would play an advisory role. The PRI structure did not develop the requisite democratic momentum and failed to cater to the needs of rural development. There are various reasons for such an outcome which include political and bureaucratic resistance at the state level to share power and resources with local-level institutions, the domination of local elites over the major share of the benefits of welfare schemes, lack of capability at the local level and lack of political will. It was decided to appoint a high-level committee under the chairmanship of Ashok Mehta to examine and suggest measures to strengthen PRIs. The Committee had to evolve an effective decentralised system of development for PRIs. They made the following recommendations:Anirban Kashyap: Panchaytiraj, Views of founding fathers and recommendation of different committees, New Delhi, Lancer Books, 1989 P 112 *the district is a viable administrative unit for which planning, coordination, and resource allocation are feasible and technical expertise available, *PRIs as a two-tier system, with Mandal Panchayat at the base and Zilla Parishad at the top, *the PRIs are capable of planning for themselves with the resources available to them, *district planning should take care of the urban-rural continuum, *representation of SCs and STs in the election to PRIs on the basis of their population, *four-year term of PRIs, *participation of political parties in elections, *any financial devolution should be committed to accepting that much of the developmental functions at the district level would be played by the panchayats. The states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal passed new legislation based on this report. However, the flux in politics at the state level did not allow these institutions to develop their own political dynamics. 97th Constitutional Amendment Act : Cooperative Societies are taken under \\"Local Government\\" after 97th Constitutional Amendment act 2011,under Dr Manmohan Singh's Govt. Part-IX of Indian Constitution is related to Local Government, under which Panchayt Raj was defined, then after 74th amendment Municipal Corporation and council were included and defined by inducing Part IX-A, and in 2011,Cooperative Societies were included in Local Government by inducing PartIX-B in the Constitution. The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2011 provided for amendment in following things : 1. It amended article 19(1)c by inserting after the word 'or unions' the words 'or Co-operative Societies'. 2. It also inserted Article 43B in part IV of the Constitution as \\"The State shall endeavor to promote Voluntary formation, autonomous functioning, democratic control and professional Management of the Co-operative Societies\\" and 3. After Part IX-A of the Constitution Part IX-B was inserted. Part IX-B extended from Article 243ZH to Article 243ZT.  G.V.K. Rao Committee (1985)  The G.V.K. Rao Committee was appointed by Planning Commission to once again look at various aspects of PRIs. The Committee was of the opinion that a total view of rural development must be taken in which PRIs must play a central role in handling people's problems. It recommended the following:World Bank: Overview of ruraldecentralisation in indi Volume III World Bank, 2000 P 21 *PRIs have to be activated and provided with all the required support to become effective organisations, *PRIs at district level and below should be assigned the work of planning, implementation and monitoring of rural development programmes, and *the block development office should be the spinal cord of the rural development process. *district development commissioner to be introduced. *election should conduct regularly.  L. M. Singhvi Committee (1986)  A committee led by Laxmi Mall Singhvi was constituted in the 1980s to recommend ways to revitalize PRIs. The Gram Sabha was considered as the base of a municipality decentralised, and PRIs viewed as institutions of self-governance which would actually facilitate the participation of the people in the process of planning and development. It recommended:Mahoj Rai et al. :The state of Panchayats – A participatory perspective, New Delhi, Smscriti, 2001 P 9 *local self-government should be constitutionally recognised, protected and preserved by the inclusion of new chapter in the Constitution, *non-involvement of political parties in Panchayat elections. The suggestion of giving panchayats constitutional status was opposed by the Sarkaria Commission, but the idea, however, gained momentum in the late 1980s especially because of the endorsement by the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who introduced the 64th Constitutional Amendment Bill in 1989. The 64th Amendment Bill was prepared and introduced in the lower house of Parliament. But it got defeated in the Rajya Sabha as non-convincing. He lost the general elections too. In 1989, the National Front introduced the 74th Constitutional Amendment Bill, which could not become an Act because of the dissolution of the Ninth Lok Sabha. All these various suggestions and recommendations and means of strengthening PRIs were considered while formulating the new Constitutional Amendment Act.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act  The idea which produced the 73rd and AmendmentThe Constitution (Seventy Third Amendment) Act, 1992, The Gazette of India, Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs, New Delhi, 1993. was not a response to pressure from the grassroots, but to an increasing recognition that the institutional initiatives of the preceding decade had not delivered, that the extent of rural poverty was still much too large and thus the existing structure of government needed to be reformed. This idea evolved from the Centre and the state governments. It was a political drive to see PRIs as a solution to the governmental crises that India was experiencing. The Constitutional (73rd Amendment) Act, passed in 1992 by the Narasimha Rao government, came into force on April 24, 1993. It was meant to provide constitutional sanction to establish \\"democracy at the grassroots level as it is at the state level or national level\\". Its main features are as follows:T M Thomas Issac with Richard Franke : Local democracy and development – Peoples Campaign for decentralized planning in Kerala, New Delhi, Leftword Books, 2000 P 19 *The Gram Sabha or village assembly as a deliberative body to decentralised governance has been envisaged as the foundation of the Panchayati Raj System.73rd Amendment of the Constitution empowered the Gram Sabhas to conduct social audits in addition to its other functions. *A uniform three-tier structure of panchayats at village (Gram Panchayat — GP), intermediate or block (Panchayat Samiti — PS) and district (Zilla Parishad — ZP) levels. *All the seats in a panchayat at every level are to be filled by elections from respective territorial constituencies. *Not less than one-third of the total seats for membership as well as office of chairpersons of each tier have to be reserved for women. *Reservation for weaker castes and tribes (SCs and STs) have to be provided at all levels in proportion to their population in the panchayats. *To supervise, direct and control the regular and smooth elections to panchayats, a State Election Commission has The Act has ensured constitution of a State Finance Commission in every State/UT, for every five years, to suggest measures to strengthen finances of panchayati raj institutions. *To promote bottom-up-planning, the District Planning Committee (DPC) in every district has been accorded to constitutional status. *An indicative list of 29 items has been given in Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution. Panchayats are expected to play an effective role in planning and implementation of works related to these 29 items.  Present scenario  A newly elected Panchayat in Punjab, India At present, there are about 3 million elected representatives at all levels of the panchayat, nearly 1.3 million are women. These members represent more than 2.4 lakh (240,000) gram panchayats, about 6,000 intermediate level tiers and more than 500 district panchayats. Panchayats cover about 96% of India's more than 5.8 lakh (580,000) villages and nearly 99.6% of the rural population. The Constitution of India visualises panchayats as institutions of self-governance. However, giving due consideration to the federal structure of India's polity, most of the financial powers and authorities to be endowed on panchayats have been left at the discretion of concerned state legislatures. Consequently, the powers and functions vested in PRIs vary from state to state. These provisions combine representative and direct democracy into a synergy and are expected to result in an extension and deepening of democracy in India. Hence, panchayats have journeyed from an institution within the culture of India to attain constitutional status. Urban Types of urban local governments include: *municipal corporations /Nagar Nigam * Nagar palikas (also called municipal councils) * Nagar panchayats /Town area Functions All municipal acts in India provide for functions, powers and responsibilities to be carried out by the municipal government. These are divided into two categories: obligatory and discretionary. = Obligatory functions = * supply of pure and wholesome water * construction and maintenance of public streets * lighting and watering of public streets * cleaning of public streets, places and sewers * regulation of offensive, dangerous or obnoxious trades and callings or practices * maintenance or support of public hospitals * establishment and maintenance of primary schools * registration of births and deaths * removing obstructions and projections in public streets, bridges and other places * naming streets and numbering houses * maintenance of law and order = Discretionary functions = * laying out of areas * securing or removal of dangerous buildings or places * construction and maintenance of public parks, gardens, libraries, museums, rest houses, leper homes, orphanages and rescue homes for women * public buildings * planting of trees and maintenance of roads * housing for low income groups * conducting surveys * organizing public receptions, public exhibitions, public entertainment * provision of transport facilities with the municipality * promotion of welfare of municipal employees Some of the functions of the urban bodies overlap with the work of state agencies. The functions of the municipality, including those listed in the Twelfth Schedule to the Constitution, are left to the discretion of the state government. Local bodies have to be bestowed with adequate powers, authority and responsibility to perform the functions entrusted to them by the Act. However, the Act has not provided them with any powers directly and has instead left it to state government discretion.

Biography = Early life and education  Born in Cisco, Texas, Turner grew up from age eight in Wichita Falls, Texas, where he started drawing while in high school. His grandfather was the courthouse architect and builder A. C. Swinburne, responsible for numerous courthouses across West Texas. After serving briefly in the U.S. Army near the end of World War I, Turner began profiting from his art talent while a freshman at Southern Methodist University. He dropped out of college for one term to attend the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. While a student at SMU, Turner and his college pals would make vagabond treks around the United States during the summer months. He edited SMU's 1922 yearbook, and after his graduation that same year with an English degree, he worked at a Dallas engraving plant.\\"Grandson of West Texas Courthouse Architect, Native of Cisco Draws 'Wash Tubbs and Easy'\\". The Abilene Reporter-News, June 5, 1943. Newlyweds in New York While freelancing from Dallas, he sold a cartoon to Judge. He then married Bethel Burson of Silverton, Texas, and the newlyweds headed for New York where he became a freelance illustrator with work published in a variety of magazines, including Redbook, Pictorial Review, Ladies' Home Journal and Boys' Life. It took him two years to crack the major market, The Saturday Evening Post, work that included illustrating the popular \\"Plupy\\" stories of Henry Shute. Jim Ivey, curator of the Cartoon Museum in Orlando, Florida, stated, \\"He was one of the best magazine illustrators in the 1920s and 1930s--the Golden Age of magazine illustrating. He was a superb artist.\\"\\"Leslie Turner, Pioneered Action Comic Strip\\", Orlando Sentinel, March 1988.\\"Leslie Turner, Pioneered Action Comic Strip\\". Chicago Tribune, March 02, 1988. After six years in New York, the couple and their two daughters moved in 1929 to Colorado where they ran a small sheep ranch while living in a two- story stone house constructed by Turner. Unfortunately, the freelance assignments from New York soon slowed, but their Colorado claim required them to spend three years on the ranch. After four years in Colorado, they returned to New York, where Turner found work doing advertising illustrations. Comic strips A Texas pal of Texan Roy Crane, Turner began in comics in 1937 as an assistant on Crane's Wash Tubbs strip. Crane recalled their youthful adventures: :Les Turner, who later was my assistant on the Wash Tubbs daily strips, is from Wichita Falls. We were going on a sort of bumming trip together after we finished art school. There were no jobs for us, and we went riding freight trains and hitching rides. I missed him by one day when he got a ride to California. I went to Galveston and got a job as ordinary seaman on a tramp steamer to Europe. When we returned and landed at New York, I got my first art job on the New York World. I started Wash Tubbs in 1924.Price, Michael H. \\"Roy Crane: A life in Comics\\" When Crane moved to Orlando, the Turner family followed in 1938, living at 1218 Conway Road, where Turner designed and built all the furniture in the house. Turner takes over In 1943, when Crane left to do Buz Sawyer, Turner took over the daily Wash Tubbs, and his signature first appeared on the strip May 31, 1943. In January 1944, Turner made comic strip history when he observed a fighter plane flying over his home in Orlando. He drew it into Wash Tubbs, surprising the War Department. The aircraft was the Northrop P-61 Black Widow, and Turner's drawing of it appeared two days before the Army's official announcement.Waugh, Coulton. The Comics. Macmillan, 1947. In the late 1940s, Turner changed the title to Captain Easy, taking on Walt Scott (1894–1970) as a Sunday page assistant during the 1940s and 1950s. At its peak, the strip was carried in 600 newspapers. It was noted for its scientific accuracy, and the Captain explained the binary system to readers when computers were in their infancy. In 1949, Turner did extensive research into alcoholism in order to write a strip sequence on the rehabilitation of drunkard Gig Wilty. The story arc brought Turner praise from many members of Alcoholics Anonymous.\\"Captain Easy creator dies\\", The Miami News, March 1, 1988.Lynn, Ernest. Les Turner's Wash Tubbs Redeems a Drunkard\\". NEA: Owosso Argus=Press, May 25, 1949. Ten years later, he researched hypnotism for a sequence timed to coincide with publicity for the movie The Hypnotic Eye (1960). The Sunday strip was drawn by during the 1960s. In late 1969-70, Turner's assistant Bill Crooks took over the art and Jim Lawrence scripted. At the time of Turner's death in Orlando in 1988, Crooks commented, \\"Everything I learned about the comic strip business I learned from him.\\"The Miami News, March 1, 1988.Danger Trail: Newspaper Reprints: Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy, October 22, 2007. Turner had three daughters, Ann, Joy and Toby. Ann Turner Cook found fame as the model for the Gerber Baby, trademarked art reproduced from a 1928 charcoal sketch by the Turner family's neighbor, artist Dorothy Hope Smith. Cook, who taught literature and creative writing in Tampa, Florida for 26 years, writes the Brandy O'Bannon mystery novels, including Trace Their Shadows and Shadow over Cedar Key, set on Florida's Gulf Coast.Snopes: \\"Here's Looking at You, Kid\\" Awards In 1965, Turner was honored by 60 Florida cartoonists during their annual Daytona Beach gathering with a plaque presented by cartoonist Dick Hodkins, regional chairman of the National Cartoonists Society.

History Originally, a proof-of-concept gatekeeper was developed by Xianping Chen, Joe Metzger and Rajat Todi for an experiment. At the start of 1999, Jan Willamowius convinced the first authors to license their code under GNU GPL and began the project. The code was named OpenH323 Gatekeeper, short OpenH323GK. A team at mediaWays provided LDAP subsystem and overlapped sending. In 2000, there are tens of people contributed to the project for coding and testing. At the start of 2001, Chih-Wei Huang at Citron and his team began to use and modify the project for their VoIP services. In September 2001 Openh323GK version 1.0 was released. In 2002, GnuGk 2.0 was released. It had new architecture for gatekeeper routed mode which can handle thousands of concurrent calls, and introduced full H.323 proxy and Citron's NAT technology. These features made it a carrier-graded H.323 gatekeeper suitable for commercial operations. To avoid confusion with other OpenH323 based gatekeepers, the project was renamed GNU Gatekeeper, short GnuGk, to reflect that it was the only gatekeeper available under a GNU license. In 2004, version 2.2 was released with a redesigned architecture, followed by the more stable version 2.2.1 in 2005.GnuGk Paper at Fostel 2004 In 2006, version 2.2.4 introduced call failover, ENUM and CLI rewriting.GnuGk Paper at Fostel 2006 In 2012, version 3.0 added IPv6 and full H.460.18/H.460.19 traversal zone support.GnuGk 3.0 Announcement Compatibility The official website maintains an interoperability list for H.323 software and products.OpenH323 Gatekeeper Interoperability Contributors Jan Willamowius is the project founder and still the maintainer .

Research shows that headache is a symptom commonly described by SLE patients —57% in one meta-analysis, ranging in different studies from 33% to 78%; of which migraine 31.7% and tension-type headache 23.5%. The existence of a special lupus headache is contested, although few high-quality studies are available to form definitive conclusions. Definition Lupus headache is an important item in the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), a scoring system often used in lupus research. The SLEDAI describes lupus headache as a \\"severe, persistent headache; may be migrainous, but must be nonresponsive to narcotic analgesia\\". A score of 8 is given to this item (items are given a relative weight of 1, 2, 4 or 8). The 1999 American College of Rheumatology case definitions of neuropsychiatric syndromes in SLE do not define lupus headache, but rather propose several headache disorders loosely based on the International Headache Society (IHS) classification. In the IHS scheme, headache due to lupus would be classified as \\"Headache attributed to other non-infectious inflammatory disease\\" (7.3.3). This label requires evidence of a disease flare accompanying the headache, and resolution of the headache with immunosuppressant treatment. However, a meta-analysis found no correlation between headaches and disease activity. Criticism Critics of this concept argue that there are no quality studies showing that headaches in patients with SLE differ from those in the general population. A detailed definition of the term lupus headache is lacking, since the terms \\"severe\\" and \\"persistent\\" are not quantified. Narcotic analgesics are not recommended for migraines or other common headache types. Other definitions from the IHS do not include responsiveness to treatments as a diagnostic criterion. Migraine patients are typically adult women around age 40, a demographic group in which SLE is also more common. Mechanism Some (but not all) studies have shown an association between (migraine) headaches in SLE and associated Raynaud's phenomenon and/or anti-cardiolipin antibodies. Further studies are needed however to prove the underlying assumption that cerebral vasospasm causes migraines in lupus patients. Diagnosis Although specific complications of SLE may cause headache (such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome), it remains unclear whether specific investigations (such as lumbar puncture or magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) are needed in lupus patients presenting with headache. Although studies using MRI or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) often find abnormalities, the value of these findings remains unclear, and they have not been able to distinguish a special \\"lupus headache\\" from other headache types in people with lupus.

It was named after a town of Durba in Ethiopia. Design and description The Adua-class submarines were essentially repeats of the preceding . They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of .Chesneau, pp. 309–10 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the Adua class had a range of at , submerged, they had a range of at .Bagnasco, p. 154 The boats were armed with six internal torpedo tubes, four in the bow and two in the stern. They were also armed with one deck gun for combat on the surface. The light anti-aircraft armament consisted of one or two pairs of machine guns. Construction and career Durbo was launched on 6 March 1938 in OTO's shipyard in La Spezia and commissioned on 1 July of the same year. In August 1938 she was assigned to Leros. Durbo spent about a year engaged in exercises between Rhodes and Leros before returning to Italy. Durbo, under command of captain Armando Acanfora, with her sisters and formed 35th Squadron (III Submarine Group) based in Messina. On June 9, 1940, she left the base for an offensive mission in the Gulf of Hammamet. On June 16, 1940, at 6:10, at the point (in the Gulf of Hammamet about 44 miles southwest of Pantelleria), while proceeding to her patrol area, Durbo launched a couple of torpedoes at a small unit (perhaps a corvette, or a French destroyer), hearing a violent detonation after two minutes, but the rough seas made it impossible to verify whether the ship had been hit. There is no information about any ships being damaged or sunk in this area on this date. For the next several months Durbo went on several more patrols around Malta and Pantelleria but without any success. On October 9, 1940, Durbo, still under command of captain Acanfora, sailed from Messina to her newly assigned area of operations, about seventy miles East of Gibraltar. On October 12, 1940, she reached her assigned area near the island of Alboran south of Málaga and commenced patrolling in anticipation of a British convoy that she was supposed to report on. Durbo patrolled the area until October 18, and sighted several ships, including a British destroyer on October 17, but didn't attack any of the sighted targets.Hoyt, p.187 In the early morning of October 18, while on the surface, captain Acanfora learned that the submarine had developed an oil leak, and ordered the crew to fix the problem as quickly as possible. A few hours later, with the sun out, and the crew sure that the leak had been repaired, Durbo submerged to about . At 17:25 a Saunders Roe A. 27 \\"London\\" of the No. 202 Squadron RAF, piloted by Captain Percy R. Hatfield, sighted air bubbles and a small patch of oil while flying off the island of Alboran, 65 miles East of the Strait of Gibraltar. Durbo just detected a ship, and rose up to periscope depth to observe her potential target. Around 17:50 together with another seaplane Saunders Roe A. 27 \\"London\\" of the No. 202 Squadron RAF, piloted by Captain Norman F. Eagleton, Hatfield dropped bombs at the location of the bubbles and the oil. The bombs dropped by the aircraft exploded but had not damaged Durbo, but forced the submarine to dive down to to avoid further attacks by the aircraft. The ship detected by Durbo was one of the British destroyers, or , patrolling nearby. After a lookout on had observed the reconnaissance planes dive and release bombs, both ships rushed in to close in on the area of attack, and soon established a contact on ASDIC. Durbo dove down to about trying to break off the attackers, and then submerged even deeper, to . The pressure strained the steel plates which increased oil leak, making the submarine's position even more visible to destroyers. The depth charges set at were dropped, resulting in a large air bubble rising to the surface, possibly damaging the submarine's air supply system. After another attack, the submarine rose rapidly to the surface and was fired upon by . The submarine dove down, and another depth charge attack followed. After about 50 depth charges were dropped by both destroyers, at around 19:30, the submarine surfaced again, and was immediately fired upon by both destroyers. One shell hit the conning tower, forcing the crew to start abandoning the boat.Hoyt, p.188Pitchfork, p.74Giorgerini, p.260 Durbo sank stern first at 19:50 on October 18, 1940, at the point with all 46 men of her crew (5 officers and 41 non-officers and sailors) rescued by . Before Durbo went under, a British boarding party made up of men from and went on board. They got down into control room, and managed to grab codes and operational orders which were not destroyed. The capture of secret documents had a fatal short-term outcome: they shown the location of other Italian submarines, and just two days later, on October 20, 1940, a group of British destroyers would set a trap to whose location was revealed by the captured documents. was sunk after a hard chase, leaving only nine survivors.Rohwer, p. 45  NotesReferences  External links *Coastal submarines: Adua class Adua-class submarines World War II submarines of Italy Lost submarines of Italy Maritime incidents in October 1940 World War II shipwrecks in the Mediterranean Sea 1938 ships Ships built by Oto Melara Ships built in La Spezia Submarines sunk by British warships ","title":"Italian submarine Durbo"},{"id":"21364187","text":"Joseph Valois (1767 - January 3, 1835) is a businessman, farmer and political figure in Lower Canada.

Technically, the ferry is a reaction ferry, which is propelled by the current of the water. The ferry is attached to a floating cable which is anchored firmly in the riverbed upstream of the ferry. To operate the ferry, it is angled into the current, causing the force of the current to swing the ferry across the river on the cable. A ferry has operated at the site since at least 1566. The reaction principle of operation was first introduced in 1863, and has continued ever since. The current ferry boat dates back to 1934, although it has been modernised several times since then.

It is a sub-company of the Gilmore Food Corporation. Unlike Jollibee and other burger chains, Burger Machine has always been retailing in outdoor stands instead of shops. History NLEX It was created in 1981 by Ms. Fe Esperanza S. Rodriguez and a sister who both planned to turn two old small buses into mobile stores, an idea they adapted from America. It was their fondness for hamburgers that inspired them to make a business that would serve for the masses. The stores were then opened near two gas stations in Quezon City. They all began with a capital of P40,000 with nearly two dozen employees working continuously. This non-stop service earned Burger Machine the nickname of \\"the burger that never sleeps.\\" A year later, a third store was opened. The company was nationally recognized. In June 1988, the company established six food plazas in areas such as Timog, Cubao, Tandang Sora, Makati, Padre Faura and Marikina. In 1990, the Corporate Office in EDSA started and was called EDSA Business Unit. It was also in this year when the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of the Department of Science and Technology confirmed their burgers as “source of the most nutrients in terms of peso value compared to other leading hamburger chains.” Through the years, Burger Machine launched dozens of branches including stalls and full-scale fast food restaurants. But during the Asian Financial Crisis of the 90's, the company saw more struggles and was forced to close down several branches and restaurants. Burger Machine is now back to its roots operation which is 24/7 burger stands for the masses. The company is also dubbed \\"the National Burger Stand of the Philippines.\\" As of 2011, Burger Machine has 1,000+ outlets across the country. Other information One distinctive character associated with the company is the dwarf which appears on every outlet. For a number of years it had been unnamed. Later in 1988, it was given one, Burger Bart through a name contest. Graphic designer/visual communicator Zeus Paredes coined the name \\"BURGER MACHINE\\" and designed the original logo and graphics on the mobile stores. The business was widely advertised on television in the mid-1990s. Among those who helped promote it include the Philippines' late master rapper Francis Magalona and iconic band Eraserheads. Permit controversy In 2007, it was revealed that a majority of Burger Machine's stores have been operating without business licenses. Because of this, the Market Development and Administration Department gave them 15 days to go with the demands lest Burger Machine as well as its parent Gilmore would undergo such consequences, specifically having those stores closed.

Larkin was the member for Willoughby in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from December 1913 until his death. He served in the First AIF, and was killed in action on the first day of the Gallipoli Campaign. He was one of only two serving members of any Australian parliament to fall in World War I — the other, who fell at Gallipoli on 4 May 1915, was George Braund, also a New South Wales MLA. Early life Larkin was born at North Lambton, New South Wales, to William Joseph Larkin, a quarryman and his wife Mary Ann, née Rennix. His family moved to Camperdown in Sydney where the young Ted Larkin was schooled at St Benedict's Broadway, run by the Marist Brothers. For his last two years of senior schooling he boarded at St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill, where he played in the college's 1896 first rugby XV. After school he worked in journalism before joining the Metropolitan Police Force in 1903 as a foot-constable, later being promoted to first-constable in 1905. His prematurely grey hair made him appear much older than he was. Rugby union career He maintained an active involvement in sports after completing his schooling and participated in cricket, swimming and rugby union playing first grade with the Endeavour Rugby Club at Newtown in Sydney. In 1903 he was captain of that club and made his representative debut for New South Wales against Queensland and the touring New Zealand national rugby team before being selected for Australia in the first test of 1903 at Sydney on 15 August, against those same All Blacks. Larkin played hooker for the Australian representative side, in a pack featuring future rugby league pioneers and dual-code rugby internationals Alex Burdon, Denis Lutge and Bill Hardcastle. The Australians were soundly beaten 22–3. Rugby league administrator Larkin knew and sympathised with a number of the senior rugby union players who in 1906 and 1907 became louder in their discontent with the administration of the New South Wales Rugby Union, over rejection of compensation payments for injuries and lost wages. The breakaway in Australia took place in 1908, as it had earlier in 1895 with the Northern Union in Northern England. A gifted public speaker, Larkin had continued to develop a strong sense of social justice during his years in the police force. After the financial failure of the 1908–09 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and claims of mismanagement by the League's founding fathers James Joseph Giltinan, cricketer Victor Trumper and Labor politician Henry Hoyle, the pioneer code looked to be in jeopardy before it had barely begun. In June 1909 Larkin left the police force and was appointed the first full-time secretary of the almost bankrupt New South Wales Rugby League. He was an excellent organizer and had success in promoting the new game evidenced by the crowd of 42,000 who filled the Agricultural Oval in June 1910 to see the Australia v Great Britain Test. During his administration which lasted till 1913, he convinced the Catholic education hierarchy and the Marist Brothers in particular to adopt rugby league as their winter sporting game. The code benefits from this legacy to this day in New South Wales and Queensland.SJC News, article by James Gray p19 Parliamentary career In December 1913 Larkin stood as the Labor Party candidate for the conservative seat of Willoughby winning 51.61% of the vote in a second ballot. He was living at Milsons Point at the time and became the first Labor Member of Parliament elected from the north side of the harbor. He was appointed as the government representative on the board of the Royal North Shore Hospital and was vocal in his support for proposal to build a bridge across Sydney Harbour Larkin was the member for Willoughby in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from December 1913 until his death. Active service and death Ted Larkin's promising career was cut short with the outbreak of World War I on 4 August 1914. Demonstrating a patriotic fervor Larkin enlisted within ten days of war's declaration joining C Coy of the 1st Battalion, of the AIF's 1st Division. In his final address to the NSW Parliament, on 18 August 1914, Larkin said, \\"I cannot engage in the work of recruiting and urge others to enlist unless I do so myself.\\" Gray quotes a brief poem published in the Sydney Sun in 1918 acclaiming Larkin for his virtue in enlisting. The battalion left Australia in October 1914, arriving in Egypt on 2 December. Larkin's brother Martin also embarked on the Transport A19 Afric for Egypt where Ted, a sergeant was active in promoting games of rugby league amongst the troops. Lone Pine cemetery The battalion landed at Anzac Cove at dawn on 25 April 1915 as part of the second and third waves, starting the Gallipoli campaign. It took part in the desperate struggle for the dominating hill known as Baby 700. The Turks wrested control of the hill and counter-attacked to drive the Australians from the high ground. That afternoon Ted Larkin died from a chest wound in a hail of machine gun fire. Heads and Middleton quote from the war memoir Imperishable Anzacs by Harold Cavill: \\"Wounded and dying he lay, yet when the stretcher-bearers came to carry him in, he waved them on, saying 'There's plenty worse than me out there'. Later they found him dead\\". His brother Martin aged 37 also lost his life that day on the heights above Anzac Cove. Neither body was recovered until the burial Armistice of 24 May but there is no known grave for either of the Larkin brothers and their names are recorded on the Lone Pine Memorial commemorating 4,934 Australian and New Zealand troops killed in the sector who have no known grave. In memoriam Confirmation of Larkin's death didn't reach Australia until June, whereupon a requiem mass was celebrated at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney attended by many distinguished citizens including the Premier and the Governor of New South Wales. Ted and Martin were both awarded posthumously the 1914–15 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. The 1915 Sydney rugby league City Cup grand final was held as a testimonial for Ted Larkin's widow and sons and raised £171. The St Joseph's College Old Boys' Union set up the Sergeant Larkin Bursary to help finance his sons fees at the college (at a meeting on 1 July 1915, the following resolution was passed: \\"That in order to commemorate the signal service of the late Sergeant E.R. Larkin, M.L.A., to Australia, the Union invite the co-operation of the all old boys to provide a bursary at St. Joseph's College for the deceased member's son\\"). The family eventually declined the offer but the bursary has survived to this day as the Old Boys' Bursary. On 30 November 1915, in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, the Speaker unveiled a commemorative tablet in honour of Lieutenant-Colonel George Braund, Member for Armidale and Sergeant Edward Rennix Larkin, Member for Willoughby who both fell at Gallipoli.

The castle of Sedlischo was first mentioned in a 1298 deed, when the Silesian duke Henry III of Głogów acquired it from the castellans at Bytom Odrzański. After the Duchy of Głogów had become a Bohemian fief in 1331, it was seized by the royal House of Luxembourg, who enfeoffed several noble families with Siedlisko. In 1561 the lordship passed to Fabian von Schoenaich, whose nephew Georg had the Renaissance Carolath Castle built and received the title of a Freiherr (Baron) from Emperor Rudolf II of Habsburg. In 1697 the Schoenaich possessions around Carolath and Bytom Odrzański were raised to the status of a Bohemian state country by decree of Emperor Leopold I of Habsburg. Castle ruins The Schoenaichs retained their estates even after the annexation of Silesia by King Frederick II of Prussia in 1742. Freiherr Hans Carl, a devoted Protestant, immediately paid homage to the new ruler and in turn received the title of a Prince of Carolath-Beuthen. The castle burnt down after the Red Army had occupied the area at the end of World War II. A Renaissance gate building and a mausoleum designed by Hans Poelzig in 1912 are preserved.

According to the statistics released by the Ministry of Education of China, the university is one of the four leading universities in the physical education area in China.体育院校排名 Ranking of PE institutes(in chinese) The university has many world-famous alumni, such as gymnast Cheng Fei, who won more than 19 gold medals including an Olympic one. And this can be better illustrated during Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, when WIPE alumni alone won 6 gold medals, 2 silver medals and 3 bronze medals. Wuhan Sports University is located in Hubei Province's capital Wuhan, known as \\"the thoroughfare leading to nine provinces\\". It has two campuses which are Majiazhuang Campus() and Canglong Campus.  History  Wuhan Sports University's origins can be traced back to Zhongnan Institute of Physical Education, in Nanchang City, Jiangxi province. The Zhongnan Institute was formed in 1953. Shortly after, in 1955, the institute moved to its present site in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and changed its name to the Wuhan Institute of Physical Education (WIPE) in February 1956. WIPE was formerly administered by the National General Administration of Sports and, now it turned to be under the administration of both the National General Administration of Sports and the Hubei Provincial Government in the year 2001. In the year 1985, WIPE started its first art major; Sport Management. Since then several other art majors emerged, such as sport psychology, sport English and so forth, till the newest Sport Advertising. And this is a quintessence of ongoing reform of Tertiary educational institutions in China, whose aim is to combine USSR-style specific school into comprehensive institution.  Academics  WIPE now has 8 colleges, 2 faculties, 3 departments and 2 schools, 15 educational and teaching units in total. The names of these units are listed as follow: * Physical Education College () * Sports Training College () * Chinese Martial Arts College () * Gymnastics College () * Sports Economy & Management College () * Health Science College or College of Health Science () * Competitive Sports School () * Adult Education School () * Sports Information & Technology Faculty () * Sports Journalism & Foreign Language Faculty () * the Postgraduate Department () * Political Theory Department () * Training Department () Since 2006, WIPE launched its 3+1 cooperative education project with University of the West of England. Students enrolled as its \\"3+1\\" project participants will study at Wuhan for the first 3 years and then go to UWE for the last year of study. In autumn semester of 2009, the first 15 students participated in the 3+1 project in 2006 were sent to UWE. WIPE was largely aimed for education of undergraduate level, and its graduate school, though famous in a time during the 1980s, was increasingly eclipsed by Beijing Sports University. However, in 2006, WIPE was authorized for the conferment of doctor's degree; and in August 2010, Ministry of Education listed WIPE as one of universities whose students can enrol directly in graduate school without taking exams. School Assets  In the year 2009, the fixed assets of WIPE were about 760 million yuan. Throughout the Majiazhuang Campus, there are 12 dormitory buildings, and is constructing the 13th one.  Natatorium  Interior of the swimming pool WIPE's indoor swimming pool, constructed in 1984 and put into service since 1986, is a combination of public and competition pool. The pool is maintained in constant temperature. It was then the largest swimming pool in China equipped with solar heating system, which were able to heat 70 tons of hot water daily according to its original design. Affiliated to and overseen by teaching and researching section of swimming in WIPE, the Swimming pool have been run by a private contractor., especially in summer. Athletes here have competed in different level of swimming event as well as less publicized fin swimming competition, having attained phenomenal accomplishments such as 10 world champions. There were 6 world records, 4 Asian records and 5 national records kept here. Recently criticisms arose in the local media concerning the health regulation in swimming pool, including WIPE's natatorium. Critics said local swimming pools lacked proper sanitation of water, and inadequately checked Health Certificate of visitors as was required by law. One of the employees here contended that > “财力有限，若配备专业医生，费用难承担；并且，根据业内“潜规则”：游泳是不需要《健康证》的。” > Roughly Translated as: With limited wherewithal, a doctor can't be afforded; > moreover, according to intra-industry hidden rules, there is no need of > Health Certificate beforehand to swim.

They competed in the National Rugby League's 2009 Telstra Premiership and finished the regular season the 5th (out of 16). The Sea Eagles were then knocked out in the first week of the play-offs by eventual premiers, the Melbourne Storm. Season summary As 2008 NRL premiers, the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles started their new season with the 2009 World Club Challenge match in England against Super League's 2008 champions, the Leeds Rhinos. They defeated the Rhinos 28 - 20, putting an end to England club football's 5-year hold on the World Club Challenge trophy before preparing for the start of the 2009 NRL season. Sea Eagles star player Brett Stewart was accused of a sexual assault with a 17-year-old girl, this coming the same day after Manly's infamous season launch on 6 March, where it was believed Stewart got drunk. The NRL suspended Stewart until Round 5 of the competition, but he was still allowed to train with the club. As a result, the club started their premiership defence poorly, with four consecutive losses seeing them at last place after round four. They won their fifth round match so they were the last team to record their first win of the season, against the Wests Tigers. Upon Stewart's return he scored 3 tries in the Sea Eagles' first win of the season. Stewart was exonerated over his sexual assault charge in September 2010. Stewart only played four further matches in the 2009 season; he suffered a knee injury in the Sea Eagles' round six victory over the South Sydney Rabbitohs and missed a great deal of football. He returned in round 25, just in time for Manly's charge to the finals; after the Sea eagles initially struggled without him on the field. Manly were eliminated in the first round of finals, going down 40-12 to the Melbourne Storm at Etihad Stadium despite finishing fifth at the end of the regular season. Losses to two of the top three teams were the reasons for Manly's early exit, ending their premiership defence in disappointment.  2009 Squad TableReferences Manly Warringah Sea Eagles seasons Manly Warringah Sea Eagles season ","title":"2009 Manly Warringah Sea Eagles season"},{"id":"21364560","text":"The Takatof Program for Social Volunteering is a nationwide volunteering initiative in the United Arab Emirates.Takatof It is one of the principal initiatives of the Emirates Foundation,Emirates FoundationTakatof Youth Foundation a charitable organisation established in 2007 in the UAE under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the Deputy Supreme Commander of UAE Armed Forces.

Emirates News Agency (WAM), 2007-04-28. Takatof is working to create a culture of volunteering throughout the UAE. It offers all residents of the country an opportunity to volunteer in an Emirati environment through activities that promote community involvement, national identity and citizenship.  Objectives  In promoting volunteering, Takatof seeks participation by citizens and all those living in the UAE, with special emphasis on young people as volunteers. * Strategic initiatives: Takatof seeks collaborative opportunities with other social organizations, so as to involve volunteers in meeting important local needs. * Building capacity: Takatof is responsible for the development and delivery of training for volunteers, agencies and the general public, through a variety of activities. * Connecting people: Takatof acts as a clearing-house, helping to connect people with relevant volunteer opportunities across the seven Emirates.  Takatof Projects  * Takatof for School Renovation: This program gives volunteers unique opportunities for semi-skilled work in revamping schools – painting, cleaning, gardening and site cleaning, as well as replacing furniture and modernizing library and laboratory facilities. This project is implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Education, Abu Dhabi Education Council and related institutions. * Volunteering in the Health Sector: Volunteers for this program perform health and administrative activities at hospitals and health centres, such as providing personal support, guidance and other services for patients, as well as receiving visitors and helping nursing staff. * Takatof for Special Needs: Participation in this program provides frequent opportunities for volunteers to utilize their leisure time through voluntary work for people with special needs. This develops their skills and life experience through humanitarian action, in collaboration with the various UAE centres for special needs. * Takatof Ramadan Project: This annual program enables volunteers to list the needs of needy and disadvantage families before the beginning of the Islamic Holy Month of Ramadan, in order to provide nominated families with supplementary food, school and health needs. The volunteers also teach the culture of saving, in order to help the families to improve their living conditions. * Takatof House Renovation Survey: This project was initiated as a follow up to the Takatof – Ramadan project (above) in which Takatof conducts case studies of families who have benefited from the Ramadan project, to assess their actual needs. The most recent survey was conducted by Takatof volunteers. It showed that house renovation has become the major requirement for most families living in the Northern Emirates. * Takatof International Volunteering Programme: This programme offers volunteers an opportunity to develop their skills and experiences outside the country, while taking part in socially responsible activities.

But some moved out of Panama to have children and increase population. Rodrigo de Bastidas, sailing westward from Venezuela in 1501 in search of gold, was the first European to explore the Isthmus of Panama. 10 years later, Vasco Núñez de Balboa visited the Isthmus and established a short-lived settlement in the Darién. Vasco Núñez de Balboa's torturous trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1513 demonstrated that the Isthmus was, indeed, the path between the seas, and Panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of Spain's empire in the New World. Gold and silver were brought by ship from South America, hauled across the Isthmus, and loaded aboard ships for Spain. The route became known as the Camino Real de Portobelo, or Royal Road of Portobelo, although it was more commonly known as Camino Real de Cruces (Royal Road of the Crosses) because the road led to the TOWN of Venta Cruces located on the Rio Chagres. Panama was part of the Spanish empire for nearly 300 years, from 1538 to 1821. From the outset, Panamanian identity was based on a sense of \\"geographic destiny\\", and Panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the Isthmus. The colonial experience also spawned Panamanian nationalism as well as a racially complex and highly stratified society, the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism. Indigenous Panama thumb Estimates vary greatly of the number of Indians who inhabited the isthmus when the Spanish explorers arrived. By some accounts, the population was considerably greater than that of contemporary Panama. Some Panamanian historians have suggested that there might have been a population of 500,000 Indians from some sixty \\"tribes\\", but other researchers have concluded that the Cuna alone numbered some 750,000.Black & Flores (\\"The Conquest\\"). Plaque with Crocodile Deity, ca. 700–900. Brooklyn Museum; In Panama the Crocodile God was the principal deity for more than a thousand years and was most likely associated with strength, the sun and water, and fertility. Besides the Cuna, which constituted by far the largest group in the area, two other major groups, the Guaymí and the Chocó, have been identified by ethnologists. The Guaymí, of the highlands near the Costa Rican border, are believed to be related to Indians of the Nahuatlan and Mayan nations of Mexico and Central America. The Chocó on the Pacific side of Darién Province appear to be related to the Chibcha of Colombia. Although the Cuna, now found mostly in the Comarca de San Blas, an indigenous territory or reserve considered part of Colón Province for some official purposes, have been categorized as belonging to the Caribbean culture, their origin continues to be a subject of speculation. Various ethnologists have indicated the possibility of a linguistic connection between the name Cuna and certain Arawak and Carib tribal names. The possibility of cultural links with the Andean Indians has been postulated, and some scholars have noted linguistic and other affinities with the Chibcha. The implication in terms of settlement patterns is that the great valleys of Colombia, which trend toward the isthmus, determined migration in that direction. Lines of affiliation have also been traced to the Cueva and Coiba tribes, although some anthropologists suggest that the Cuna might belong to a largely extinct linguistic group. Some Cuna believe themselves to be of Carib stock, while others trace their origin to creation by the god Olokkuppilele at Mount Tacarcuna, west of the mouth of the Río Atrato in Colombia. Among all three Indian groups — the Cuna, Guaymí, and Chocó — land was communally owned and farmed. In addition to hunting and fishing, the Indians raised corn, cotton, cacao, various root crops and other vegetables, and fruits. They lived then — as many still do — in circular thatched huts and slept in hammocks. Villages specialized in producing certain goods, and traders moved among them along the rivers and coastal waters in dugout canoes. The Indians were skillful potters, stonecutters, goldsmiths, and silversmiths. The ornaments they wore, including breastplates and earrings of beaten gold, reinforced the Spanish myth of El Dorado, the city of gold. The conquest Rodrigo de Bastidas, a wealthy notary public from Seville, was the first of many Spanish explorers to reach the isthmus. Sailing westward from Venezuela in 1501 in search of gold, he explored some 150 kilometers of the coastal area before heading for the West Indies. A year later, Christopher Columbus, on his fourth voyage to the New World, touched several points on the isthmus. One was a horseshoe-shaped harbor that he named Puerto Bello (beautiful port), later renamed Portobelo. upright Vasco Núñez de Balboa, a member of Bastidas' crew, had settled in Hispaniola (present-day Dominican Republic and Haiti) but stowed away on a voyage to Panama in 1510 to escape his creditors. At that time, about 800 Spaniards lived on the isthmus, but soon the many jungle perils, doubtless including malaria and yellow fever, had killed all but 60 of them. Finally, the settlers at Antigua del Darién (Antigua), the first city to be duly constituted by the Spanish crown, deposed the crown's representative and elected Balboa and Martin Zamudio co-mayors. Balboa proved to be a good administrator. He insisted that the settlers plant crops rather than depend solely on supply ships, and Antigua became a prosperous community. Like other conquistadors, Balboa led raids on Indian settlements, but unlike most, he proceeded to befriend the conquered tribes. He took the daughter of a chief as his lifelong mistress. On September 1, 1513, Balboa set out with 190 Spaniards — among them Francisco Pizarro, who later conquered the Inca Empire in Peru — a pack of dogs, and 1,000 Indian slaves. After twenty-five days of hacking their way through the jungle, the party gazed on the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. Balboa, clad in full armor, waded into the water and claimed the sea and all the shores on which it washed for his God and his king. Balboa returned to Antigua in January 1514 with all 190 soldiers and with cotton cloth, pearls, and 40,000 pesos in gold. Meanwhile, Balboa's enemies had denounced him in the Spanish court, and King Ferdinand appointed a new governor for the colony, then known as Castilla de Oro. The new governor, Pedro Arias de Avila, who became known as \\"Pedrarias the Cruel\\", charged Balboa with treason. In 1517 Balboa was arrested, brought to the court of Pedrarias, and executed. In 1519 Pedrarias moved his capital away from the debilitating climate and unfriendly Indians of the Darién to a fishing village on the Pacific coast (about four kilometers east of the present-day capital). The Indians called the village Panama, meaning \\"plenty of fish.\\" In the same year, Nombre de Dios, a deserted early settlement, was resettled and until the end of the 16th century served as the Caribbean port for trans-isthmian traffic. A trail known as the Camino Real, or royal road, linked Panama and Nombre de Dios. Along this trail, traces of which can still be followed, gold from Peru was carried by muleback to Spanish galleons waiting on the Atlantic coast. The increasing importance of the isthmus for transporting treasure and the delay and difficulties posed by the Camino Real inspired surveys ordered by the Spanish crown in the 1520s and 1530s to ascertain the feasibility of constructing a canal. The idea was finally abandoned in mid-century by King Philip II (1556–98), who concluded that if God had wanted a canal there, He would have built one. Pedrarias' governorship proved to be disastrous. Hundreds of Spaniards died of disease and starvation in their brocaded silk clothing; thousands of Indians were robbed, enslaved, and massacred. Thousands more of the Indians succumbed to European diseases to which they had no natural immunity. After the atrocities of Pedrarias, most of the Indians fled to remote areas to avoid the Spaniards. The regulations for colonial administration set forth by the Spanish king's Council of the Indies decreed that the Indians were to be protected and converted to Christianity. The colonies, however, were far from the seat of ultimate responsibility, and few administrators were guided by the humane spirit of those regulations. The Roman Catholic Church, and particularly the Franciscan order, showed some concern for the welfare of the Indians, but on the whole, church efforts were inadequate to the situation. The Indians, nevertheless, found one effective benefactor among their Spanish oppressors. Bartolomé de las Casas, the first priest ordained in the West Indies, was outraged by the persecution of the Indians. He freed his own slaves, returned to Spain, and persuaded the council to adopt stronger measures against enslaving the Indians. He made one suggestion that he later regretted—that Africans, whom the Spaniards considered less than human, be imported to replace the Indians as slaves. In 1517 King Charles V (1516–56) granted a concession for exporting 4,000 African slaves to the Antilles. Thus the slave trade began and flourished for more than 200 years. Panama was a major distribution point for slaves headed elsewhere on the mainland. The supply of Indian labor had been depleted by the mid-16th century, however, and Panama began to absorb many of the slaves. A large number of slaves on the isthmus escaped into the jungle. They became known as cimarrones, meaning wild or unruly, because they attacked travelers along the Camino Real. An official census of Panama City in 1610 listed 548 citizens, 303 women, 156 children, 146 mulattoes, 148 Antillean blacks, and 3,500 African slaves. The Spanish colony The period of free, though licensed, exploration gave way to a period in which the king exercised royal control by appointing governors and their staffs. All were to be paid from crown revenues expected from the royal profits on the colony. The king's representative was responsible for ensuring such returns; he tracked all gold, pearls, and income from trade and conquest; he weighed out and safeguarded the king's share.Black & Flores (\\"The Spanish Colony\\"). Governors had some summary powers of justice, but audiencias (courts) were also established. The first such audiencia, in Santo Domingo, Hispaniola, had jurisdiction over the whole area of conquest. As settlement spread, other audiencias were set up. By a decree of 1538, all Spanish territory from Nicaragua to Cape Horn was to be administered from an audiencia in Panama. This audiencia lasted only until 1543 because of the impossibility of exercising jurisdiction over so vast an area. A new Panamanian audiencia, with jurisdiction over an area more nearly coinciding with the territory of present-day Panama, was established in 1563. The viceroy's position was revived for the rich empires of Mexico and Peru. After 1567 Panama was attached to the Viceroyalty of Peru but retained its own audiencia. Beginning early in the 16th century, Nombre de Dios in Panama, Vera Cruz in Mexico, and Cartagena in Colombia were the only three ports in Spanish America authorized by the crown to trade with the homeland. By the mid-1560s, the system became regularized, and two fleets sailed annually from Spain, one to Mexico, and the other to southern ports. These fleets would then rendezvous at Havana and return together to Cádiz, Spain. In principle, this rigid system remained in effect until the 18th century. From the middle of the 17th century, however, as the strength and prosperity of Spain declined, annual visits became the exception. Shipments of bullion and goods were to be delivered to Panama on the Pacific side for transport over the isthmus and return to Spain. Panama's own contribution to the loading of the fleet was relatively small. Gold production was never great, and little exportable surplus of agricultural and forest products was available. Nothing was manufactured; in fact, Spain discouraged the production of finished goods. The colony's prosperity, therefore, fluctuated with the volume of trade, made up largely of Peruvian shipments. When the Inca gold was exhausted, great quantities of silver mined in Peru replaced gold in trade for 150 years, supplemented eventually by sugar, cotton, wine, indigo, cinchona, vanilla, and cacao. Spain had banned Indian slavery, so the colonists started importing African slaves. By 1565, there were 7 African slaves for every European. Many African slaves ran away and joined up with escaped Indian slaves and remnants of the local Indian population. A slave called Felipillo founded a village of Africans and Indians in the mangroves of the Gulf of San Miguel that lasted two years before being wiped out in 1551. Escaped slaves, or maroons, soon outnumbered the European population and they defeated Spanish expeditions against them in 1554 and 1555.1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created, by Charles C. Mann, London: Granta Books, 2011. Except for traffic in African slaves, foreign trade was forbidden unless the goods passed through Spain. Africans were brought to the colonies on contract (asiento) by Portuguese, English, Dutch, and French slavers, who were forbidden to trade in any other commodities. Spanish efforts to retain their monopoly on the rich profits from trade with their colonies provided a challenge to the rising maritime nations of Europe. Intermittent maritime warfare resulted in the Caribbean and later in the Pacific. The first serious interference with trade came from the English. From 1572 to 1597, Francis Drake was associated with most of the assaults on Panama. Drake's activities demonstrated the indefensibility of the open roadstead of Nombre de Dios. In 1597 the Atlantic terminus of the trans- isthmian route was moved to Portobelo, one of the best natural harbors anywhere on the Spanish Main (the mainland of Spanish America). Drake allied with the Cimarron people, the local population based around escaped slaves. Seventeenth Century Despite raids on shipments and ports, the registered legal import of precious metals increased threefold between 1550 and 1600. Panama's prosperity was at its peak during the first part of the 17th century. This was the time of the famous ferias (fairs, or exchange markets) of Portobelo, where European merchandise could be purchased to supply the commerce of the whole west coast south of Nicaragua. When a feria ended, Portobelo would revert to its quiet existence as a small seaport and garrison town. Panama City also flourished on the profits of trade. Following reconstruction after a serious fire in 1644, contemporary accounts credit Panama City with 1,400 residences \\"of all types\\" (probably including slave huts); most business places, religious houses, and substantial residences were rebuilt of stone. Panama City was considered, after Mexico City and Lima, the most beautiful and opulent settlement in the West Indies. Interest in a canal project was revived early in the 17th century by Philip III of Spain (1598–1621). The Council of the Indies dissuaded the king, arguing that a canal would draw attack from other European nations—an indication of the decline of Spanish sea power. During the first quarter of the 17th century, trade between Spain and the isthmus remained undisturbed. At the same time, England, France, and the Netherlands, one or all almost constantly at war with Spain, began seizing colonies in the Caribbean. Such footholds in the West Indies encouraged the development of the buccaneers—English, French, Dutch, and Portuguese adventurers who preyed on Spanish shipping and ports with the tacit or open support of their governments. Because of their numbers and the closeness of their bases, the buccaneers were more effective against Spanish trade than the English had been during the previous century. The volume of registered precious metal arriving in Spain fell from its peak in 1600; by 1660 volume was less than the amount registered a century before. Depletion of Peruvian mines, an increase in smuggling, and the buccaneers were causes of the decline. Henry Morgan, a buccaneer who had held Portobelo for ransom in 1668, returned to Panama with a stronger force at the end of 1670. On January 29, 1671, Morgan appeared at Panama City. With 1,400 men he defeated the garrison of 2,600 in pitched battle outside the city, which he then looted. The officials and citizens fled, some to the country and others to Peru, having loaded their ships with the most important church and government funds and treasure. Panama City was destroyed by fire, probably from blown up powder stores, although the looters were blamed. After 4 weeks, Morgan left with 175 mule loads of loot and 600 prisoners. Two years later, a new city was founded at the location of the present-day capital and was heavily fortified. The buccaneer scourge rapidly declined after 1688 mainly because of changing European alliances. By this time Spain was chronically bankrupt; its population had fallen; and it suffered internal government mismanagement and corruption. Influenced by buccaneer reports about the ease with which the isthmus could be crossed—which suggested the possibility of digging a canal—William Paterson, founder and ex-governor of the Bank of England, organized a Scottish company to establish a colony in the San Blas area. Paterson landed on the Caribbean coast of the Darién late in 1698 with about 1,200 persons. Although well received by the Indians (as was anyone not Spanish), the colonists were poorly prepared for life in the tropics with its attendant diseases. Their notion of trade goods—European clothing, wigs, and English Bibles—was of little interest to the Indians. These colonists gave up after six months, unknowingly passing at sea reinforcements totaling another 1,600 people. The Spanish reacted to these new arrivals by establishing a blockade from the sea. The English capitulated and left in April 1700, having lost many lives, mostly from malnutrition and disease. Eighteenth century In Spain, Bourbon kings replaced the Habsburgs in 1700, and some liberalization of trade was introduced. These measures were too late for Panama, however. Spain's desperate efforts to maintain its colonial trade monopoly had been self-defeating. Cheaper goods supplied by England, France, and the Netherlands were welcomed by colonial officials and private traders alike. Dealing in contraband increased to the detriment of official trade. Fewer merchants came to the Portobelo feria to pay Spain's inflated prices because the foreign suppliers furnished cheaper goods at any port at which they could slip by or bribe the coastal guards. The situation worsened; only five of the previously annual fleets were dispatched to Latin America between 1715 and 1736, a circumstance that increased contraband operations. Panama's temporary loss of its independent audiencia, from 1718 to 1722, and the country's attachment to the Viceroyalty of Peru were probably engineered by powerful Peruvian merchants. They resented the venality of Panamanian officials and their ineffectiveness in suppressing the pirates (outlaws of no flag, as distinct from the buccaneers of the 17th century). Panama's weakness was further shown by its inability to protect itself against an invasion by the Miskito Indians of Nicaragua, who attacked from Laguna de Chiriquí. Another Indian uprising in the valley of the Río Tuira caused the whites to abandon the Darién. The final blow to Panama's shrinking control of the transit trade between Latin America and Spain came before the mid-18th century. As a provision of the Treaty of Utrecht at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713, Britain secured the right to supply African slaves to the Spanish colonies (4,800 a year for 30 years) and also to send 1 ship a year to Portobelo. The slave trade provision evidently satisfied both countries, but the trade in goods did not. Smuggling by British ships continued, and a highly organized contraband trade based in Jamaica—with the collusion of Panamanian merchants—nearly wiped out the legal trade. By 1739 the importance of the isthmus to Spain had seriously declined; Spain again suppressed Panama's autonomy by making the region part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada (encompassing present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama). In the same year, war broke out between Britain and Spain. A British military force took Portobelo and destroyed it. Panamanian historians maintain that this attack diverted Spanish trade from the trans-isthmian route. The Seville–Cádiz monopoly of colonial trade had been breached by royal decrees earlier in the century, and precedent was thus furnished for the merchants of the Latin American colonies to agitate for direct trade with Spain and for intercolonial trade. After 1740 the Pacific coast ports were permitted to trade directly via ships rounding Cape Horn, and the Portobelo feria was never held again. Relaxing the trading laws benefited both Spanish America and Spain, but Panama's economic decline was serious. Transit trade had for so long furnished the profits on which Panama had flourished that there had been no incentive to develop any other economic base. After the suppression of its audiencia in 1751, Panama became a quiet backwater, a geographically isolated appendage of New Granada, scarcely self-supporting even in food and producing little for export. In 1793, near the close of the colonial period, the first recorded attempt at a comprehensive census of the area that had comprised the Panamanian audiencia was made. Incomplete and doubtless omitting most of the Indian and cimarrón population, specifically excluding soldiers and priests, the census recorded 71,888 inhabitants, 7,857 of whom lived in Panama City. Other principal towns had populations ranging from 2,000 to a little over 5,000. Social hierarchy in the colony was rigid. The most prestigious and rewarding positions were reserved for the peninsulares , those actually born in Spain. Criollos, those of Spanish ancestry but born in the colonies, occupied secondary posts in government and trade. Mestizos, usually offspring of Hispanic fathers and Indian mothers, engaged in farming, retail trade, and the provision of services. African and Indian slaves constituted an underclass. To the extent possible, Indians who escaped enslavement avoided Hispanic society altogether. The church held a special place in society. Priests accompanied every expedition and were always counselors to the temporal leaders. The first bishop on the mainland came with Pedrarias. The bishop's authority, received from the king, made him in effect a vice governor. The bishopric was moved from Darién to Panama City in 1521. The relationship between church and government in the colony was closer than in Spain. Both the Roman Catholic Church and the monastic orders gained great wealth through tithes and land acquisition. Independence from Spain Lacking communication except by sea, which the Spanish generally controlled, Panama remained aloof from the early efforts of the Spanish colonies to separate from Spain. Revolutionaries of other colonies, however, did not hesitate to use Panama's strategic potential as a pawn in revolutionary maneuvers. General Francisco de Miranda of Venezuela, who had been attracting support for revolutionary activities as early as 1797, offered a canal concession to Britain in return for aid. Thomas Jefferson, while minister to France, also showed interest in a canal, but the isolationist policies of the new United States and the absorption of energies and capital in continental expansion prevented serious consideration.Black & Flores (\\"Independence from Spain\\"). Patriots from Cartagena attempted to take Portobelo in 1814 and again in 1819, and a naval effort from liberated Chile succeeded in capturing the island of Taboga in the Bay of Panama. Panama's first act of separation from Spain came without violence. When Simón Bolívar's victory at Boyacá on August 7, 1819, clinched the liberation of New Granada, the Spanish viceroy fled Colombia for Panama, where he ruled harshly until his death in 1821. His replacement in Panama, a liberal constitutionalist, permitted a free press and the formation of patriotic associations. Raising troops locally, he soon sailed for Ecuador, leaving a native Panamanian, Colonel José de Fábrega, as acting governor. Panama City immediately initiated plans to declare independence, but the city of Los Santos preempted the move by proclaiming freedom from Spain on November 10, 1821. This act precipitated a meeting in Panama City on November 28, which is celebrated as the official date of independence.

Plot summary Prince Roger is ordered by his mother and older half-brother to attend a ceremony in Leviathan. Roger travels on the spaceship Charles DeGlopper with Eleanora O'Casey, Kostas Matsugae, and Captain Vil Krasnitsky. During the trip, a sentry is discovered shot dead on the ship, and Sergeant-Major Eva Kosutic then discovers charges in the main plasma conduits. Kosutic catches the ship's logistics officer, Ensign Guha, and shoots her just before the charges are detonated. As a result, the ship is forced to land in the nearest star system, Marduk. Prince Roger and his body guards escape in shuttles hoping to land on the planet and capture the space port. The shuttles eventually land further from the port than planned and Bravo Company sets out on their long journey. The company reach a jungle and D'Nall Cord, a shaman of the X'Intai people, suddenly appears from the jungle. He decides to introduce them to his tribe. While in the village, Cord and Delkra (the tribal chief) consult with Roger, Pahner and O'Casey on a serious problem facing the tribe from the city-state of Q'Nkok. The city and the X'Intai have a treaty whereby the city dwellers are permitted to cut only certain trees in a specific area of the tribe's territory. In recent months the woodcutters have been cutting deeper into the jungle than permitted. To attack the woodcutters would create war. The tribe could launch a surprise attack on Q'Nkok and feast on their food stores, but Pahner requests that they delay attacking Q'Nkok until after the company has gone there. The company proceeds to Q'Nkok. They are brought before the King Xiya Kan and state their need for supplies in exchange for hi-tech tools. The company arrange to eavesdrop on the king's council and hear him attack them for their continued misconduct. The company bugs all the great houses to discover who is involved and the marines discover that three of the great houses are conspiring to topple the king. The marines and the king's guards assault the Great Houses' homes and afterwards the company and the marines set forth into Kranolta territory. As Kranolta hunters ambush the company repeatedly, Sergeant Cobedra is killed. Meanwhile, the Kranolta assemble all of their tribes and decide to attack the human invaders. They strike and the company is forced to try to get to the walls of the city. The next day, the Kranolta approach the Citadel. Suddenly, a new force emerges from the jungle which assault the Kranolta's remaining forces. The reduced company depart from Voitan and continue to march until they reach Marshad. They arrive at the king's palace. Later, Lt. Jasco, Kosutic, Julian, Poertena and Denat meet in the kitchen and witness a wall opening up to reveal Kheder Bijan. Kheder tells the humans that King Radj will have to send his entire army to destroy them. Kheder says that there are factions in Marshad in league with Pasule. All the marines need to do is to attack the army. On the morning of the battle, the marines set off to the battle field. The plasma cannon is hauled to the top of a hill and the bridge explodes and breaks. Three days after the battle, Roger meets with Kheder Bijan, who is the new king of Marshad and inquires as to the delay in giving them the supplies and shields that were promised. However, after getting in a conflict with Kheder, Roger shoots him. T'Leen establishes a more rational regime, redistributing the land and dedicating more of it to food production. Roger then mounts the flar-ta Patty and gives to order to continue the march towards the mountains. Locations on Marduk Visited by the Marines Q'Nkok - The first city-state that Roger and Bravo Company visit along the March. Like most Mardukan cities and villages it is located on a hill top to avoid flash floods. The city is ruled by King Xiya Kan and a council composed of the heads of all the great houses. While king is charged with protecting the city and ruling it the council is rife with intrigue and political backstabbing and a serious thorn in the king's side. Voitan - Once the shining commercial and industrial center of the Hurtan region, known for its superior metal works and Damascene Steel, the city of Voitan found itself overwhelmed by the barbarian tribes of the Kranolta who had sacked the city and the surrounding city-states and occupied the region. However, the sacking of the city-states was not as complete as the Kranolta had thought as many of the cities artisans and workers along with their wealth had fled the city and established themselves elsewhere preparing for the day that they might retake the city. As a youth, D'Nal Cord was sent to study in Voitan. Marshad - Radj Kordan, who had been king during the fall of Voitan, had found himself facing a rebellion among the great houses. After emerging victorious, he planned to strip them of their guards, fine them heavily and reduce their power, but was assassinated before he could do this. In retaliation, his son killed every member of the rebellious houses and absorbed his single remaining ally, thus leaving the House of Radj the only power in the city. Since then the city has fallen into ruin with crushing poverty everywhere except in the king's palace with all of the city's revenues from the lucrative trading dianda (a flax-like silk which is planted everywhere around the city at the expense of food) going towards defense (retaining many mercenaries) and lining the pockets of the king and his advisors while the peasants starve. The city's closest neighbor is the city-state Pasule which lives in constant fear of Marshad and its king.

Ruled by a monarchy (house MacClintock) and a parliament consisting of an elected senate and a house of lords, the empire encompasses a great many worlds with varying degrees of technological development. Recent political problems, beginning with the reign of Emperor Andrew (Roger's grandfather), have created a great deal of factionalism, unrest and inequality, particularly between the core worlds and the outer planets. The result is a brewing crisis that the Empress has been desperately attempting to prevent and which is the cause of the attack on Roger that strands him and his marines on Marduk. The Caravazan Empire - The Terran Empire's traditional enemy. Following the ascent of Pierpaelo Cavaza - a devotee of the Church of Ryback (an organization dedicated to removing \\"humanocentric\\" damage from the universe) - to the throne shortly after the Dagger Years, the empire embraced the tenets of the church into law. The move had triggered a short civil war that Cavaza had won proving that he was just as ruthless as his ancestors. Now the empire is led by his followers, religious eco-freaks who seek to impose their belief on how nature should be handled. As part of this belief system, the Saints \\"reclaim\\" certain worlds by forcing humans to remove all human influence and pollution (including their own waste - which is why they basically starve the people sent to reclaim these worlds to death). Raiden- Winterhowe - A revanchist empire that was once invaded and forced to defend itself and now continues to expand because it simply can't stop. The Alphane Alliance - An alliance consisting of 12 worlds and populated by humans, Althari and Phaenurs. The Althari are a female-dominated, stoic warrior race that resemble 3 meter tall koala bears while the Phaenurs are a four-legged, lizard-like race of functional telepaths (among themselves) and empaths. The Althari, being descended from ground burrowing creatures prefer underground dwellings with clear fields of fire, making them more like subterranean bunkers than homes. In Althari society, males are definitely second-class citizens, untrusted by the females, many of whom consider them as being useful only for breeding and housework. Defined by O'Casey as \\"very shrewd bargainers\\" since they can't be lied to (the Phaenurs being able to sense deception). The Alliance is on friendly terms with the Empire of Man. Technology Tutorial Implants (\\"Toots\\") - An implanted computer processor that interfaces completely with human neural systems without adverse side effects. Used primarily for data processing, storage and training, the toot augments a persons learning capability, including the use of assassination programs (for better marksmanship) or translating alien languages. The device can, in fact, take over for the person and allow him to perform tasks more efficiently. However, it is a security planner's nightmare, as the toot can be hacked and the person forced to do a task against their will (as if they'd been possessed by a demon). People whose toots have been hacked are called \\"toot zombies\\" or \\"toombies\\". ChromSten - The hardest substance known to modern science, a form of collapsed matter, used both in ship's armor and in personal body armor. Only a plasma rifle (or something stronger) can penetrate ChromSten. Tunnel Drive - The faster-than-light method of transport used for interstellar travel. Ships equipped with tunnel drives tend to be huge, as the drive takes up a lot of volume. Every star system, depending on the size of its primary star, has a limit within which entry into tunnel space is impossible (known as the Tsukayama Limit). Travel between star systems takes days and sometimes weeks. Phase Drive - The drive used when the ship is in normal space. Bead Rifles and Cannons - Projectile weapons that fire five- millimeter steel-coated, glass- or tungsten-cored beads \\"accelerated to phenomenal speeds\\" via electromagnetic lining in the weapon's barrel. Plasma Rifles and Cannons - The main field energy weapon, capable of taking out powered armor. The plasma rifles utilize a magazine containing lithium- deuteride pellets and a power source to feed the laser compressors that initiate the fusion reaction that drives the weapon. Chameleon Suits - The standard issue marine uniform that allows the wearer to fade into the background. The suits also offer limited ballistic protection and can be configured for work in vacuum environments. Powered Armor - ChromSten made armor that offers even better ballistic protection and camouflage capabilities that chameleon suits and are susceptible to damage only from heavy energy weapons such as plasma rifles and cannons or the last-ditch, contact-range weapon called a \\"one-shot\\", which delivers a shock wave through the armor to the plasteel matrix supporting it, causing a scab to break free and ricochette inside the armor, killing the person inside. Nanotechnology - Widely used throughout the story and in many ways. Prince Roger, his staff, the marines and the navy personnel attached all have nannites floating around in their blood stream whose function is to enhance the person's regenerative capabilities (even a lost limb, though this takes a metabolic toll on the body), process alien nutrients into something human anatomy can use, increase the body's endurance and protect against disease and foreign toxins. The marines also have nanotech recording devices used in an intelligence gathering function. These devices are the size of a small insect and can move like one so as to look innocuous.

Prussian G 8.2 The Prussian G 8.2 was a 2-cylinder version of the Prussian G 8.3. It had been established that the inside third engine of the G 8.3 was not absolutely necessary and discontinued the G 8.3 as a consequence. Like that engine the G 8.2 had been developed from the G 12 and was in essence a shorter version of it. The locomotives were employed on heavy goods train duties on main lines. Later the top speed on some units was raised to 75 km/h so that the G 8.2 could also be used to haul passenger trains. A total of 846 examples of the locomotive were built between 1919 and 1928 for the Prussian state railways and the Deutsche Reichsbahn. Five vehicles, that had been delivered in 1921 to the Reichsbahndirektion of Oldenburg, had been equipped with Lentz valve gear as was usual on the Oldenburg machines. The locomotives delivered in 1922 were Cassel division numbers; in 1923 several were supplied as DRG Class 31 before they were allocated their eventual DRG numbers in 1923. Another 150 vehicles were supplied to the Turkish and Rumanian railways. The firm of AEG converted four engines to coal-dust firing in 1930. 650 examples of these locos were still present in Germany after the Second World War. The Deutsche Reichsbahn had given them operating numbers 56 2001–2485 and 2551–2916. In the Deutsche Bundesbahn this class was very quickly retired; the last one to go being no. 56 2637, withdrawn in 1963 and retired in 1965. The Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany used these locomotives right up to the early 1970s - a number even being given computer numbers. Its last stronghold was Bw Vacha in Thuringia, which had both the first and last engine to be built: nos. 56 2001 and 56 2916. In Germany no Class 56.20–29 has been preserved. No. 56 2795 is in the Warsaw railway museum as no. Tr6-39. Link: Ehemalige 56 2795 in Warschau G 8.2 of the LBE The G 8.2s with the Lübeck-Büchen Railway were certainly similar to the Prussian G 8.2s, but were in fact an independent design with numerous differences. For example, they were noticeably longer and did not appear quite as stocky. They were intended to take charge of heavy goods trains running between Hamburg and Lübeck. Because these locomotives were also to be used in passenger services, the running gear and brakes were designed so that the top speed could be raised to 75 km/h. A total of eight engines was delivered between 1923 and 1930 by Linke-Hofmann. In 1938 they were given Reichsbahn numbers 56 3001-3008. The Deutsche Bundesbahn took over locomotives 56 3001 and 56 3003-3008 and retired them by 1951. No. 56 3002 was left to the Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR) in the east, who retired her in 1956. Locomotive 56 3007 has been preserved and is in the Darmstadt-Kranichstein Railway Museum. The engines were equipped with tenders of classes pr 3 T 16.5, pr 3 T 20 or pr 2'2' T 21.5.

It was occupied on and off from the 1st millennium BC until the 16th century, when an L shaped tower house stood there. Tynron Doon lies at the southern end of the Scaur hills. Description The original site is thought to be a multivallate hill fort dating to the Iron Age, of much the same plan as the modern (20th C.) remains. The site is itself a spur hill of Auchengibbert Hill, and reaches in height. The summit has an approximately oval plateau, of in extent. The fort was built in a natural defensive position defended by steep slopes on the north, south and east sides. The western approach was made defensive by the addition of three ditches and two ramparts, with some of the ditches rock-cut. In the 15th century the hill was the site of one of nine beacons maintained by the Sheriffs of Nithsdale and Annandale. In the late medieval era (c. 16th C.) an L-shaped tower house was built in the northwest corner of the central area, with floor plan of roughly ; a smaller extension to the northwest is speculated to have been a tower stair. The tower house is thought to have been demolished between 1700 and 1750, used to build the church in Tynron (Tynron Kirk) and a barmkin wall fortification enclosing the summit may have been added in around the same period. A hut circle dating to the 18th/19th C. is thought to have been a shepherd's bothy.

The Nigamkalpataru refers to the poet Jayadev living for a time in Chandranath. By the time of Dhanya Manikya, ruler of Tripura, Chandranath received numerous endowments. Dhanya Manikya attempted to remove the idol of Shiva from the temple to his kingdom but failed. Legend Sati was the first wife of Shiva as the first incarnation of Parvati. She was the daughter of King Daksha and Queen (the daughter of Brahma). She committed self-immolation at the sacrificial fire of a yagna performed by her father Daksha as she felt seriously distraught by her father's insult of her husband and her by not inviting them for the yagna. Shiva was so grieved after hearing of the death of his wife that he danced around the world in a Tandav Nritya (“devastating penance” or dance of destruction) carrying Sati's dead body over his shoulders. Perturbed by this situation and to bring Shiv to a state of normalcy, Vishnu decided to use his Sudarshan Chakra (the rotating discus carried on his finger tip). He dismembered Sati's body with the chakra into 51 pieces and wherever her body fell on the earth, the place was consecrated as a divine shrine to Shakthi Peeth with deities of Sati (Parvati) and Shiva. These locations have become famous pilgrimage places as Pithas or Shakthi Pithas are found scattered all over the subcontinent including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, apart from India. Sati is also known as Devi or Shakthi, and with blessings of Vishnu she was reborn as the daughter of Himavat or Himalayas and hence named as Parvati (daughter of mountains). She was born on the 14th day of the bright half of the month of Mrigashīrsha, which marks the Shivarathri (Shiva's night) festival.* The Chandranath Temple as a Shakti Peeth Shiva carrying the corpse of Sati Devi The Chandranath Temple is considered as a Shakti Peetha, the revered shrines of Shaktism. The mythology of Daksha yaga and Sati's self immolation is the source mythology behind the origin of Shakti Peethas. Shakti Peethas are divine shrines of Shakti, due to the falling of body parts of the corpse of Sati Devi, when Lord Shiva carried it and wandered throughout Aryavartha in sorrow. There are 51 Shakti Peeth linking to the 51 alphabets in Sanskrit. Each temple have shrines for Shakti and Kalabhairava. The Right Arm of Sati Devi's corpse is believed to have fallen here. The Shakti is known by the name Bhavani.

It was recorded at Metropolis Studios in London and produced by punk rock veteran Bill Price, who had recorded albums by Sex Pistols and The Clash. The album was recorded live in the studio and the music was not arranged by the producer in order to achieve a rough, live sound. The record contains loud punk songs that explore social issues such as sex and abuse. To promote the album, the band embarked on a major tour in Europe and both coasts of the United States, including a performance at CBGB in New York City. The songs \\"Husband\\" and \\"Nothing\\" reached number 58 and number 52 respectively on the UK Singles Chart. Upon release, Black Eye received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Most journalists praised the album's unrelenting mood, but some criticised the vagueness of the lyrics. Prominent music critic Robert Christgau ranked it as one of the best albums of 1996. Background and recording Black Eye is the only full-length album by the English punk rock band Fluffy. The band formed in London in late 1994 by singer and guitarist Amanda Rootes, guitarist Bridget Jones, bassist Helen Storer, and drummer Angie Adams. Unsatisfied with the Britpop invasion at the time, the band sought to recapture the punk rock phenomenon. According to Rootes, \\"We want to infiltrate and conquer the masses. It's like, Americans think English music's shit – 'cause it is. We want [England] to gain a little respect that we haven't had for a while.\\" The band also felt more comfortable in North America than in the UK because the British press \\"can't handle the concept of a sexually frank all-girl band\\"; the name of the band comes from a lesbian novel titled Fluffy Butch, which Rootes thought was funny. After turning down a number of record labels, the band signed to The Enclave, a record label run by A&R; executive Tom Zutaut, who had previously signed Guns N' Roses to Geffen. Rootes felt that Zutaut was \\"great. Very American, very cool, very into his artists.\\" Black Eye was recorded at Metropolis Studios in London and produced by punk rock veteran Bill Price, who had recorded albums by Sex Pistols and The Clash. The album was recorded live in the studio and the music was not arranged by the producer in order to achieve a rough, live sound. According to Rootes, Price \\"just recorded us live while we were playing. We did things like putting different guitar tracks on top and stuff like that. I did vocals at different times. But we really wanted to get a live sound.\\" The drums were recorded in a stone room using a basic kit that was modeled after a Ringo Starr reissue model, which resulted in a slightly distorted sound. The album was mastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound in New York City. Music and lyrics Musically, Black Eye was described by Carrie Borzillo of Billboard as \\"pure hardcore punk delivered with a raunchy, abrasive vocal assault from [Rootes].\\" Aaron Axelsen, music director at modern rock KITS, opined that the band is \\"a real indie, edgy version of Elastica, but not Britpop. They fit into that Hole, L7, Tuscadero, Veruca Salt, edgy thing.\\" The band, however, felt \\"insulted\\" when journalists compared them to Elastica because they think the sound of Elastica is too \\"clean\\". As Rootes recalls, \\"I admit every time me and Bridged cleaned our house we put Elastica on\\". Despite this, she considers Elastica, along with the Sex Pistols and the Buzzcocks, as the only UK bands among her favorites. The band cited the Sex Pistols, the New York Dolls, and The Stooges as their musical influences. They also preferred the Sex Pistols over the Clash. According to Rootes, \\"The Sex Pistols are political in a great teenage fuck-you way. The Clash are political in a mature way, like they've done politics in A-levels.\\" The lyrics of Black Eye deal with sexual and abuse topics: \\"Nothing you will likely hear on the radio\\", Rootes explained. The song \\"Hypersonic\\", named after the best-selling vibrator in England, celebrates the joys of vibrator use. The title track, \\"Black Eye\\", is about domestic violence. Rootes remarked: \\"When I was frowing up, my dad was really violent. I knew it was something I had to write a song about – to get it out of my system.\\" The song inspired the album cover, which depicts a cat holding a mouse in its jaw. Rootes explained that the mouse's black eye represents a moment of serenity before it dies. Similarly, the song \\"Scream\\" deals with rape issues, while \\"Dirty Old Bird\\" is about spousal abuse. The track \\"Technicolour Yawn\\" is about the unpleasant effect of a hangover, \\"Psychofudge\\" is about drug usage, and \\"Cheap\\" deals with one's loss of virginity and the subsequent feel of becoming \\"sort of cheap and common.\\" Not all the songs from the album explore social issues. The songs \\"I Wanna Be Your Lush\\" and \\"Too Famous\\" use satire to criticise the superior attitudes of male musicians, while \\"Husband\\" disapproves \\"gruff and pushy\\" boyfriends. The band also clarified that they have nothing against men. As Rootes notes, \\"Men are great! We love them! We're talking about dickhead men, not all men.\\" The band considered themselves more of a pro-girl band than a feminist band. Rootes told Select: \\"So many girls are afraid to be girls. Apart from Courtney Love, who's really feminine and uses her sexuality and is a strong woman. I don't think women should dress like boys. That's what's great about PJ Harvey. She was boyish and now she's gone really glam. She looks amazing and she's become an icon: a real woman.\\" Promotion and release Prior to the album release, Fluffy performed at CBGB in New York City. Black Eye is the first full-length album released by The Enclave. To promote the launch of the album, the record label, who had been working with the band since December 1995, released several singles for \\"Husband\\", \\"Psychofudge\\", \\"Cheap\\", and \\"Hypersonic\\" prior to the album release. The Enclave also released an EP consisting of five live songs recorded at New York's CBGB on 15 May 1996 and released on 9 July 1996 to further awareness of the band. Prominent music critic Robert Christgau described the sound of the EP as \\"as pure punk as the '90s get.\\" Zutaut also admitted that the band's punk attitude \\"may scare radio and MTV a little bit\\", but he believed that their melodic music and lyrical statements \\"would pave the way for its success.\\" The band embarked on a major tour in both coasts of the United States in April, May, and September 1996. In Europe, the band also toured in Ireland with Foo Fighters, appeared at major summer festivals, and played with the Sex Pistols, Iggy Pop, and the Buzzcocks at Finsbury Park in London on 23 June 1996. The album was released on 17 September 1996 in the United States and 30 September 1996 in the United Kingdom. The songs \\"Husband\\" and \\"Nothing\\" reached number 58 and number 52 respectively on the UK Singles Chart. A music video was made for \\"Black Eye\\" under the direction of Floria Sigismondi. Critical reception Upon release, Black Eye received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Tom Sinclair, writing for Entertainment Weekly, stated that the album \\"barrels forward with such high-spirited hookiness that it's possible to forgive the shameless pandering of lyrics like 'I wanna be your kitten/Caress my fur.'\\" In a very positive review, prominent music critic Robert Christgau felt that most of the songs \\"live up to the underlining\\" and considered the album to be the best punk debut since the ones by the Ramones, Sex Pistols, The Clash, and Wire. AllMusic reviewer Tom Demalon praised the loud guitar playing of both Rootes and Jones and opined that \\"the lack of dynamic diversity makes Black Eye somewhat of a one-trick pony, but it's a trick that makes the album's strongest tracks a joy.\\" Nick Duerden of Q magazine remarked that Black Eye \\"sounds like a cross between The Stooges and Courtney Love. And despite boasting the musical dexterity of Status Quo, it's a short, sharp shock that dispatches its venom with a tireless guile.\\" Similarly, critic Roy Wilkinson of Select compared some songs favourably to The Stooges and early-Siouxsie and the Banshees. However, he noted that the band \\"[seems] intent on falling short of PJ [Harvey]'s black-bordered presence. When was the last time you heard the Yeovil delta blues sound enlivened by such Carry On Riffing-isms as 'I've rocketed to Uranus' ('Nothing') and 'When the kids scream, there is a racket/You've got a magnificent packet' ('Too Famous')?\\" In a negative review, Darren Gawle of Drop-D magazine criticised the lyrics for their vague observations about obvious truths, stating: \\"The only shocking thing about Black Eye lies in a band trying to pass themselves off as Riot Grrls when in fact they pack as much 'Grrr' as a slightly vexed Yorkshire Terrier.\\" In contrast, Colin Weston of Drowned in Sound commented: \\"The thing about Fluffy, is they aren't the most lyrically challenging of bands, but their music more makes up for it, and what they DO say, you understand immediately... not messing about with 'Deep and meaningful' lyrics, these girls have got something to say, and say it the only way they know how... in your face!!!\\" Although Black Eye was not ranked in the Top 40 of The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1996, Christgau placed it at number 3 in his own \\"Dean's List\\".

The march had been called in defiance of an appeal by Northern Ireland Prime Minister Terence O'Neill for a temporary end to protest. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association and some Derry nationalists had advised against it. Supporters of Ian Paisley, led by Major Ronald Bunting, denounced the march as seditious and mounted counter-demonstrations along the route. At Burntollet an Ulster loyalist crowd numbering in the region of 300, including 100 off-duty members of the Ulster Special Constabulary (USC), attacked the civil rights marchers from adjacent high ground.Susan McKay, Northern Protestants: An Unsettled People, Blackstaff Press, 2000, p. 315 Stones transported in bulk from William Leslie's quarry at Legahurry were used in the assault, as well as iron bars and sticks spiked with nails. Nearby members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) did little to prevent the violence. Many of the marchers described their assailants' lack of concern about the police presence. The violence was followed by renewed riots in Derry City. Terence O'Neill described the march as \\"a foolhardy and irresponsible undertaking\\" and said that some of the marchers and their supporters in Derry were \\"mere hooligans\\", outraging many, especially as the attackers had evaded prosecution. Loyalists celebrated the attack as a victory over Catholic \\"rebels\\". The ambush at Burntollet irreparably damaged the credibility of the RUC.

In practice, the religious element was de-emphasized and the primary modalities were individual and group therapy. Episcopal priests Elwood Worcester and Samuel McComb established a clinic at the church which lasted 23 years and offered both medical and psychological services. The primary long- term influence of the movement, however, was on the treatment of alcoholism. Religious background: Worcester and McComb Elwood Worcester (1862–1940) was the originator of the Emmanuel movement philosophy. He was raised in an educated middle-class family which fell into poverty as a result of business reversals and the death of Worcester's father. After high school, Worcester went to work at a railway claim-department office. One day, while alone in the office, he had an experience of the room filling with light and heard the words, \\"Be faithful to me and I will be faithful to you.\\" After discussing the experience with his priest, Algernon Crapsey, he became convinced that he was called to the ministry. At the time he was supporting his family, but he later entered Columbia University on scholarship and earned a bachelor's degree with highest honors. As a candidate for orders Worcester was required to attend a recognized seminary, in spite of his own conviction that he would be better prepared by attending a German university. He was able to satisfy the requirements for the first two years of General Seminary in New York by studying the texts and passing examinations. He then graduated from the Seminary after only one year of full-time attendance and immediately left for Germany to enter the University of Leipzig. After an initial year devoted to classical studies, he spent two years studying with Franz Delitzsch, foremost Hebraist of the day, and psychologists Wilhelm Wundt and Gustav Theodor Fechner. In his autobiography, Worcester recalled that the liberal German academic tradition, which \\"tends to weaken and remove the false opposition which has grown up between the things of the mind and the things of the Spirit,\\" was the inspiration for much of his later work. After his ordination in 1891, Worcester became chaplain and professor of psychology and philosophy at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. His indecision between academic and parish work was resolved by a call to a historic parish in Philadelphia, St. Stephen's. One of his parishioners at St. Stephens was noted neurologist S. Weir Mitchell, who became a close friend and a source of guidance in the application of depth psychology to ministry. After 8 years Worcester moved on to Emmanuel Church in Boston. The next year he was joined by Samuel McComb as associate rector. McComb (1864–1938) was raised in Belfast, Ireland and educated at Oxford. He had been a professor of church history at Queens University in Ontario and served as minister of Presbyterian churches in England and New York City, before being ordained in the Episcopal Church. A popular speaker and an excellent writer, he became the primary spokesman for the movement during its active years.New York Times Obituary, Samuel McComb, 12 September 1938 Medical background: Cabot, Pratt, Putnam and Coriat Boston was the center of a local \\"medical psychotherapy\\" tradition going back to the 1890s when William James, Josiah Royce, Hugo Munsterberg and Boris Sidis developed individualized techniques for the relief of mental distress. The psychiatric professionals of the 19th century, alienists and neurologists, were primarily concerned with severe pathology such as schizophrenia and mania. Little attention was paid to milder mental conditions. The New England psychopathologists, in contrast, dealt with the problems of those who were more or less functional but unhappy. They treated patients with anxiety or depression or in the grip of compulsive behaviors. James Jackson Putnam (1846–1918), Harvard's first professor of diseases of the nervous system and a founder of the American Psychoanalytic Association, was influenced by this tradition of eclectic therapy. He saw the Emmanuel movement, with its synthesis of psychology and \\"moral\\" treatment, as a positive development. His support was important in the reception of the movement by the orthodox medical community. Dr. Richard C. Cabot, in 1905, concluded that he didn’t have enough information to make exact diagnoses of his patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital clinics. He didn’t know where they lived or worked, what they worried about or ate for dinner. He believed it was important to understand his patients’ economic situation, what toxins they may have been exposed to and how they were handling the stress of daily life. With his own money, he hired a nurse, Garnet Isabel Pelton (November 25, 1868 - June 15, 1925), to serve as Mass General’s first social worker. Then, in 1907, Dr. Cabot hired Ida Maud Cannon (June 29, 1877 - July 7, 1960), who later held the title of Chief of Social Service (1914-1945) at the hospital. Together, Cabot and Cannon led the development and growth of the first social services department in a hospital in the United States.Social Workers: Making Health Care More Effective, Jennifer Nejman Bohonak, Massachusetts General Hospital Magazine, 2011 Cabot became chief of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital from 1912 until his retirement, was an innovator in both medical education and psychosocial medicine. He introduced the first weekly \\"Grand Rounds,\\" now traditional in teaching hospitals. Cabot wrote popular books on counseling, ethics and religion which reflected his continuing loyalty to the philosophy he had learned under Josiah Royce. Dr. Joseph Pratt (1872–1956) received his degree in medicine (1898) from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where he studied under William H. Welch and Sir William Osler. He joined Cabot's tuberculosis clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1903. From 1927 he served as chief of medicine at the Boston Dispensary and professor at Tufts University School of Medicine.Banks, Henry H. (1993). A Century of Excellence: The History of Tufts University School of Medicine. Boston: Tufts University. The Pratt Diagnostic Clinic at Tufts Medical Center is named in his honor. Although tuberculosis was then endemic in urban areas, treatments in vogue were labor-intensive and available mainly to the affluent. If there was any hope of offering this sort of care to the poor, Dr. Pratt realized that working with groups of patients and care- givers would be necessary. He also had a lifelong interest in the influence of psychosocial factors on physical and mental illness, so he had confidence in the value of integrated support systems. Dr. Isador Coriat (1875–1943) was a Tufts neurologist/psychopathologist whose major professional influence was Morton Prince. Unlike most of his medical colleagues, Coriat was the son of Jewish immigrants of limited means. He had entered medical school directly from the public school system and began his medical career at Worcester State Hospital under Dr. Adolf Meyer. As a member of the first generation of American psychoanalysts, he was a link between 19th century experimental psychology and 20th century dynamic psychiatry. Early projects In 1905, Dr. Pratt asked Elwood Worcester if Emmanuel Church could offer any support for a project to improve the care of tuberculosis patients living in the poorest sections of Boston. Dr. Pratt hoped to encourage rest, optimal nutrition and fresh air (the primary treatments then used in tuberculosis sanatoria) through classes and home visits. Emmanuel Church provided both meeting space and the entire funding of the project, but there was no clergy involvement or religious component. Encouraged by the success of the tuberculosis class, Worcester consulted local neurologists about the possibility of similar work among the \\"nervously and morally diseased.\\" He assured them that he was not attempting to establish any new doctrine, but only to give each patient the best opportunity possible for health and well- being. The response was positive. Dr. James Putnam presided over the first meeting to plan the new project. Cabot and Coriat served as speakers and medical advisors. These preliminary meetings developed into the \\"Weekly Health Conference.\\" Each meeting began with hymns and prayers, and included a lecture by a medical doctor or member of the clergy. The techniques of suggestion and auto-suggestion were a strong component of their psychology, but the approach was eclectic. Spiritual lectures often reflected New Thought influence. The formal program was followed by an hour of fellowship, at which there was only one rule: no mention of disease was allowed. In 1908 a fire destroyed much of the town of Chelsea. Worcester, McComb and members of the church moved quickly to assist those left homeless. They rented one of the few homes left standing and turned it into the \\"Emmanuel Relief Station\\", offering food and clothing. Next they arranged for the help of doctors in treating burns and wounds, and provided instruments and supplies. The house was also used for the care of women during and after childbirth (at the time most babies were delivered at home, at least among the poor). After the relief station closed, the parish expanded the care offered at their primary location to include some medical services. With the expansion of the Social Services Department, the church needed a full-time worker to supervise the projects. Courtenay F. Baylor (November 3, 1870 - May 30, 1947), a former insurance salesman who had come to Elwood Worcester for help with his own problems a few years earlier, was hired in 1912. His role grew over time to that of a lay psychotherapist. Years of growth Ladies Home Journal published a series of articles written by Elwood Worcester in 1908-9 introducing his ideas to a national audience. The first book about the movement, Religion and Medicine, The Moral Control of Nervous Disorders by Worcester, McComb and Isador Coriat, appeared in 1908. The book went through nine printings in its first year of publication as the popularity of the movement grew. Four components made up the primary approach to therapy. The church continued to offer large lectures and classes, primarily devoted to what would now be termed \\"functional\\" illness (Worcester and McComb did not claim that they could cure organic disease). There was a clinic, held under the auspices of the church and staffed by physicians, which offered some traditional medical care. The third component, unique at the time, offered the services of \\"lay therapists\\" who were trained on the job by Worcester, McComb and others. Treatment consisted of a relatively brief form of analysis, support and direction for making changes in the patient's life, and the use of suggestion to relieve symptoms. Therapy was reinforced by volunteers who visited the patients at home. Notoriety and opposition Publicity brought criticism, particularly from conservative physicians. Cabot, Coriat, and Pratt, however, remained loyal despite the onslaught.Gifford, Sanford (1997). The Emmanuel Movement: The Origins of Group Treatment and the Assault on Lay Psychotherapy. Boston: Harvard University Press Putnam, who had been an early sponsor, withdrew his support in 1907 due to concerns that medical supervision was inadequate. Worcester took steps to increase the role of doctors in response to the criticism. He also reduced his contact with the media, as the notoriety was an annoyance to some of his parishioners. Clarence B. Farrar (1874-1970), a Maryland psychiatrist, compared the movement to Christian Science. \\"Just now,\\" he wrote, \\"while the mother science of Mrs. Eddy, synchronously with the patent medicine fraternity, has been getting into somewhat ill odor throughout the states, a Son of the Blood arises in the person of the Reverend Elwood Worcester, of Boston, and from the land of witchcraft and transcendentalism we receive a new gospel.\\" The physicians supporting to movement, he claimed, were \\"willing to sell their birthright and to surrender a part of their legitimate province, to hand over impotently to the clergy for treatment, certain conditions which are just as truly the manifestations of disease or trauma as would be a broken limb or febrile delirium.\\" Sigmund Freud made his only visit to the United States in 1909, at the height of the media coverage of the Emmanuel movement. In an interview with a reporter for the Boston Evening Transcript on September 11, 1909, Freud admitted that he knew very little about the movement but said that \\"this undertaking of a few men without medical, or with very superficial medical training, seems to me at the very least of questionable good.\\" Later years Samuel McComb left Emmanuel Church in 1916 to become dean of the Cathedral of the Incarnation in Baltimore, Maryland. He returned to the Boston area a few years later to teach at Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, then moved to France to become rector of the American Episcopal Church in Nice. Elwood Worcester had little time to devote to work with individuals while serving as rector, but continued to supervise Courtenay Baylor and other lay therapists who trained at Emmanuel. In 1931, Worcester retired from Emmanuel Church. Courtenay Baylor arranged for the use of a house in Boston, and the two incorporated as the Craigie Foundation in order to continue their counseling work. Body, Mind and Spirit, by Elwood Worcester and Samuel McComb, was published in 1931. In the book's introduction, Worcester reflected on \\"the remedial ministry undertaken by my associates and by me in Emmanuel Church, Boston.\\" They had begun in a time when the pre-Freudian methods of psychotherapeutic work dominated the field, and later incorporated, in a limited way, some of the methods of psychoanalysis. They had \\"prepared hundreds of patients for surgical operations . . . had been able to remove pain and to obtain natural sleep. . . I am thinking primarily, however, of alcoholism and of other drug addictions. It is well known that we have obtained as good and as permanent results in these fields as any other workers, and these results have been obtained by suggestion and by the inculcation of new and more spiritual principles.\\" Influence Ernest Jacoby (November 6, 1880 - 1934), a Boston rubber merchant and Emmanuel parishioner, began weekly meetings for men with alcohol problems in 1909. Later the group was advertised as the Jacoby Club, \\"A Club for Men to Help Themselves by Helping Others.\\" In a 1910 church newsletter Elwood Worcester wrote that it was not \\"an ordinary temperance society,\\" that the goal was \\"to see that careful scientific treatment by qualified physicians and clergymen is administered to those who need it.\\" Primarily, however, the group was devoted to mutual help. The Jacoby Club remained active through the 1920s and 30s, and in its declining years provided space for the earliest Boston meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous. Courtenay Baylor became well known as an expert on alcoholism, publishing a description of his methods in 1919. One of the recovering alcoholics who attended his classes in 1921-22 was Richard R. Peabody, a descendant of a wealthy and influential Boston family. Peabody trained as a lay therapist under Baylor's direction and then set up his own practice, first in Boston and then in New York City. His 1931 book, The Common Sense of Drinking, was dedicated to Baylor and became a classic in the field of alcoholism treatment.

Panama City immediately initiated plans to declare independence, but the city of Los Santos preempted the move by proclaiming freedom from Spain on November 10, 1821. This act precipitated a meeting in Panama City on November 28, which is celebrated as the official date of independence. Considerable discussion followed as to whether Panama should remain part of Colombia (then comprising both the present-day country and Venezuela) or unite with Peru. The bishop of Panama, a native Peruvian who realized the commercial ties that could be developed with his country, argued for the latter solution but was voted down. A third possible course of action, a union with Mexico proposed by emissaries of that country, was rejected. Panama thus became part of Colombia, then governed under the 1821 Constitution of Cúcuta, and was designated a department with two provinces, Panamá and Veraguas. With the addition of Ecuador to the liberated area, the whole country became known as Gran Colombia. Panama sent a force of 700 men to join Simón Bolívar in Peru, where the Peruvian War of Independence continued. The termination of hostilities against the royalists in 1824 failed to bring tranquillity to Gran Colombia. The constitution that Bolívar had drafted for Bolivia was put forward by him to be adopted in Gran Colombia. The country was divided principally over the proposal that a president would serve for life. The president would not be responsible to the legislature and would have power to select his vice president. Other provisions, generally centralist in their tendencies, were repugnant to some, while a few desired a monarchy. Panama escaped armed violence over the constitutional question but joined other regions in petitioning Bolívar to assume dictatorial powers until a convention could meet. Panama announced its union with Gran Colombia as a \\"Hanseatic State\\", i.e., as an autonomous area with special trading privileges until the convention was held. In 1826 Bolívar honored Panama when he chose it as the site for a congress of the recently liberated Spanish colonies. Many leaders of the revolutions in Latin America considered the establishment of a single government for the former Spanish colonies the natural follow-up to driving out the peninsulares. Both José de San Martín and Francisco de Miranda proposed creating a single vast monarchy ruled by an emperor descended from the Incas. Bolívar, however, was the one who made the most serious attempt to unite the Spanish American republics. Although the league or confederation envisioned by Bolívar was to foster the blessings of liberty and justice, a primary purpose was to secure the independence of the former colonies from renewed attacks by Spain and its allies. In this endeavor Bolívar sought Britain's protection. He was reluctant to invite representatives of the United States, even as observers, to the congress of plenipotentiaries lest their collaboration compromise the league's position with the British. Furthermore, Bolívar felt that the neutrality of the United States in the war between Spain and its former colonies would make its representation inappropriate. In addition, slavery in the United States would be an obstacle in discussing the abolition of the African slave trade. Bolívar nevertheless acquiesced when the governments of Colombia, Mexico, and Central America invited the United States to send observers. Despite the sweeping implications of the Monroe Doctrine, President John Quincy Adams—in deciding to send delegates to the Panama conference—was not disposed to obligate the United States to defend its southern neighbors. Adams instructed his delegates to refrain from participating in deliberations concerning regional security and to emphasize discussions of maritime neutrality and commerce. Nevertheless, many members of the United States Congress opposed participation under any conditions. By the time participation was approved, the delegation had no time to reach the conference. The British and Dutch sent unofficial representatives. The Congress of Panama, which convened in June and adjourned in July 1826, was attended by four American states—Mexico, Central America, Colombia, and Peru. The Treaty of Union, League, and Perpetual Confederation drawn up at that congress would have bound all parties to mutual defense and to the peaceful settlement of disputes. Furthermore, because some feared that monarchical elements sympathetic to Spain and its allies might regain control of one of the new republics, the treaty included a provision that if a member state substantially changed its form of government, it would be excluded from the confederation and could be readmitted only with the unanimous consent of all other members. The treaty was ratified only by Colombia and never became effective. Bolívar, having made several futile attempts to establish lesser federations, declared shortly before his death in 1830 that \\"America is ungovernable; those who served the revolution have plowed the sea.\\" Despite his disillusion, however, he did not see United States protection as a substitute for collective security arrangements among the Spanish-speaking states. In fact, he is credited with having said, \\"The United States seems destined by Providence to plague America with misery in the name of Liberty.\\" Three abortive attempts to separate the isthmus from Colombia occurred between 1830 and 1840. The first was undertaken by an acting governor of Panama who opposed the policies of the president, but the Panamanian leader reincorporated the department of Panama at the urging of Bolívar, then on his deathbed. The second attempted separation was the scheme of an unpopular dictator, who was soon deposed and executed. The third secession, a response to civil war in Colombia, was declared by a popular assembly, but reintegration took place a year later. The California gold rush and the railroad Even before the United States acquired California after the Mexican–American War (1846–48), many heading for California used the isthmus crossing in preference to the long and dangerous wagon route across the vast plains and rugged mountain ranges. Discovery of gold in 1848 increased traffic greatly. In 1847 a group of New York City financiers organized the Panama Railroad Company. This company secured an exclusive concession from Colombia allowing construction of a crossing, which might be by road, rail, river, or a combination. After surveys, a railroad was chosen, and a new contract so specifying was obtained in 1850. The railroad track followed generally the line of the present canal. The first through train from the Atlantic to the Pacific side ran on the completed track on January 28, 1855. The gold rush traffic, even before the completion of the railroad, restored Panama's prosperity. Between 1848 and 1869, about 375,000 persons crossed the isthmus from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and 225,000 crossed in the opposite direction. Prices for food and services were greatly inflated, producing enormous profits from meals and lodging. The railroad also created a new city and port at the Atlantic terminus of the line. The town that immediately sprang up to accommodate the railroad offices, warehouses, docks, and shops and to lodge both railroad workers and passengers soon became, and remains, the second largest in the country. United States citizens named it Aspinwall, after one of the founders of the Panama Railroad Company, but the Panamanians christened it Colón, in honor of Columbus. Both names were used for many years, but because the Panamanians insisted that no such place as Aspinwall existed and refused to deliver mail so addressed, the name Colón prevailed. The gold rush and the railroad also brought the United States \\"Wild West\\" to the isthmus. The forty-niners tended to be an unruly lot, usually bored as they waited for a ship to California, frequently drunk, and often armed. Many also displayed prejudice verging on contempt for other races and cultures. The so-called Watermelon War of 1856, in which at least sixteen persons were killed, was the most serious clash of races and cultures of the period. In 1869 the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in the United States. This development reduced passenger and freight traffic across the isthmus and diminished the amount of gold and silver shipped east. During the height of the gold rush, however, from 1855 to 1858, only one-tenth of the ordinary commercial freight was destined for or originated in California. The balance concerned trade of the North Americans with Europe and Asia. The railroad company, because of its exceptionally high return on a capitalization that never exceeded US$7 million, paid a total of nearly US$38 million in dividends between 1853 and 1905. Panama received US$25,000 from Colombia's annuity and benefited from transient trade and some inflow of capital. The uncompleted French canal Throughout the nineteenth century, governments and private investors in the United States, Britain, and France intermittently displayed interest in building a canal across the Western Hemisphere. Several sites were considered, but from the start the ones in Nicaragua and Panama received the most serious attention. President Andrew Jackson sent Charles A. Biddle as his emissary in the 1830s to investigate both routes, but the project was aborted when Biddle abandoned his government mission and negotiated instead with Colombian capitalists for a private concession. Nevertheless, Colombia continued to express interest in negotiating with the United States on building a canal. A treaty was signed in 1846 between the two countries. The treaty removed the existing restrictive tariffs and gave the United States and its citizens the right of free transit of persons and goods over any road or canal that might be constructed in the isthmus. In addition, the United States guaranteed the neutrality of the isthmus and Colombia's sovereignty over it, with a view to ensuring uninterrupted transit for the duration of the treaty, which was to be twenty years or as long thereafter as the parties gave no notice to revise it. Called the Mallarino–Bidlack Treaty of 1846, it was actually ratified and became effective in 1848. Because the canal interests of Britain and the United States had continued to clash, particularly in Nicaragua, Britain and the United States sought to ease tensions by entering into the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850. The governments agreed specifically that neither would acquire rights to or construct a Nicaraguan canal without the participation of the other. This general principle was extended to any canal or railroad across Central America, to include the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico and Panama. In effect, since neither government was then willing or able to begin a canal, the treaty was for the time an instrument of neutrality. Colombia's attempt to attract canal interest finally brought French attention to bear on Panama. After several surveys, a concession of exclusive rights was obtained from Colombia, and a company was formed in 1879 to construct a sea-level canal generally along the railroad route. Ferdinand de Lesseps, of Suez Canal fame, headed the company. The terms of the concession required completion in twelve years, with the possibility of a six- year extension at Colombia's discretion. The lease was for ninety years and was transferable, but not to any foreign government. The company also purchased most of the stock of the Panama Railroad Company, which, however, continued to be managed by Americans. A ceremonious commencement of work was staged by de Lesseps on January 1, 1880, but serious earth moving did not start until the next year. As work progressed, engineers judged that a sea- level canal was impracticable. De Lesseps, a promoter but not an engineer, could not be convinced until work had gone on for six years. Actual labor on a lock canal did not start until late in 1888, by which time the company was in serious financial difficulty. At the peak of its operations the company employed about 10,000 workers. De Lesseps had to contend not only with enemies who hampered financing by spreading rumors of failure and dumping stocks and bonds on the market but also with venal French politicians and bureaucrats who demanded large bribes for approving the issue of securities. His efforts to get the French government to guarantee his bonds were blocked by the United States, on the grounds that such action would lead to government control in violation of the Monroe Doctrine. The end result in January 1889 was the appointment of a receiver to liquidate the company, whereupon all work stopped. Despite the French company's disastrous financial experience, an estimated two-fifths of the excavation necessary for the eventual canal had been completed. Many headquarters and hospital buildings were finished. Some of the machinery left on the site was usable later, and the railroad had been maintained. Another legacy of the French company's bankruptcy was a large labor force, now unemployed, mostly Antillean blacks. More than half were repatriated, but thousands remained, many of whom eventually worked on the United States canal. The spillover from Colombia's civil strife During the last half of the nineteenth century, violent clashes between the supporters of the Liberal and Conservative parties in Colombia left the isthmus' affairs in constant turmoil. Local self-government for the department of Panama was extended when the Liberals were in power and withdrawn when the Conservatives prevailed. The Catholic Church was disestablished under the Liberals and reestablished under the Conservatives. The fortunes of local partisans rose and fell abruptly and often violently. According to one estimate, the period witnessed forty administrations of the Panamanian department, fifty riots and rebellions, five attempted secessions, and thirteen interventions by the United States, acting under the provisions of the Bidlack-Mallarino Treaty. Partisan clashes and foreign intervention exacerbated racial antagonisms and economic problems and intensified grievances against the central government of Colombia. Between 1863 and 1886, the isthmus had twenty-six presidents. Coup d'état, rebellions, and violence were almost continuous, staged by troops of the central government, by local citizens against centrally imposed edicts, and by factions out of power. The chaotic conditions that had prevailed under the federalist constitution of 1863 culminated in the 1884 election of Rafael Núñez as president of Colombia, supported by a coalition of moderate Liberals and Conservatives. Núñez called all factions to participate in a new constituent assembly, but his request was met by an armed revolt of the radical Liberals. Early in 1885, the Panama crisis of 1885 took place. A revolt headed by a radical Liberal general and centered in Panama City developed into a three-way fight. Colón was virtually destroyed. United States forces landed at the request of the Colombian government but were too late to save the city from being burned. Millions of dollars in claims were submitted by companies and citizens of the United States, France, and Britain, but Colombia successfully pleaded its lack of responsibility. Additional United States naval forces occupied both Colón and Panama City and guarded the railroad to ensure uninterrupted transit until Colombian forces landed to protect the railroad. The new constitution of 1886 established the Republic of Colombia as a unitary state, with departments were distinctly subordinate to the central government. Panama was singled out as subject to the direct authority of the government. The United States consul general reported that three-quarters of the Panamanians wanted independence from Colombia and would revolt if they could get arms and be sure of freedom from United States intervention. Panama was drawn into Colombia's Thousand Days' War (1899–1902) by rebellious radical Liberals who had taken refuge in Nicaragua. Like the rest of Colombia, opinion in Panama was divided, and revolts in the southwest had hardly been suppressed when Liberals from Nicaragua invaded the Pacific coastal region and nearly succeeded in taking Panama City in mid-1900. The fortunes of war varied, and although a local armistice gave supporters of the Colombian government temporary security in the Panama-Colón region, the rebels were in control throughout the isthmus. Meanwhile, by early 1902 the rebels had been defeated in most of Colombia proper. At that point, the Colombian government asked the United States to intercede and bring about an armistice in Panama, which was arranged aboard the in the Bay of Panama in 1902. Throughout the period of turmoil, the United States had retained its interest in building a canal through either Nicaragua or Panama. An obstacle to this goal was overcome in December 1901 when the United States and Britain signed the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty. This treaty nullified the provisions of the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850 and signified British acceptance of a canal constructed solely by or under the auspices of the United States with guarantees of neutrality. The 1903 treaty and qualified independence Naval operations during the Spanish–American War (1898–1901) served to convince U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt that the United States needed to control a canal somewhere in the Western Hemisphere. This interest culminated in the Spooner Bill of June 29, 1902, providing for a canal through the isthmus of Panama, and the Hay–Herrán Treaty of January 22, 1903, under which Colombia gave consent to such a project in the form of a 100-year lease on an area 10 kilometers wide. This treaty, however, was not ratified in Bogotá, and the United States, determined to construct a canal across the isthmus, intensively encouraged the Panamanian separatist movement. By July 1903, when the course of internal Colombian opposition to the Hay–Herrán Treaty became obvious, a revolutionary junta had been created in Panama. José Augustin Arango, an attorney for the Panama Railroad Company, headed the junta. Manuel Amador Guerrero and Carlos C. Arosemena served on the junta from the start, and five other members, all from prominent Panamanian families, were added. Arango was considered the brains of the revolution, and Amador was the junta's active leader. With financial assistance arranged by Philippe Bunau-Varilla, a French national representing the interests of Lesseps's company, the native Panamanian leaders conspired to take advantage of United States interest in a new regime on the isthmus. In October and November 1903, the revolutionary junta, with the protection of United States naval forces, carried out a successful uprising against the Colombian government. Acting, paradoxically, under the Mallarino–Bidlack Treaty of 1846 between the United States and Colombia—which provided that United States forces could intervene in the event of disorder on the isthmus to guarantee Colombian sovereignty and open transit across the isthmus—the United States prevented a Colombian force from moving across the isthmus to Panama City to suppress the insurrection. President Roosevelt recognized the new Panamanian junta as the de facto government on November 6, 1903; de jure recognition came on November 13. Five days later Bunau-Varilla, as the diplomatic representative of Panama (a role he had purchased through financial assistance to the rebels) concluded the Isthmian Canal Convention with Secretary of State John Hay in Washington, D.C. Bunau- Varilla had not lived in Panama for seventeen years before the incident, and he never returned. Nevertheless, while residing in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, he wrote the Panamanian declaration of independence and constitution and designed the Panamanian flag. Isthmian patriots particularly resented the haste with which Bunau-Varilla concluded the treaty, an effort partially designed to preclude any objections an arriving Panamanian delegation might raise. Nonetheless, the Panamanians, having no apparent alternative, ratified the treaty on December 2, and approval by the United States Senate came on February 23, 1904. The rights granted to the United States in the so-called Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty were extensive. They included a grant \\"in perpetuity of the use, occupation, and control\\" of a sixteen- kilometer-wide strip of territory and extensions of three nautical miles into the sea from each terminal \\"for the construction, maintenance, operation, sanitation, and protection\\" of an isthmian canal. Furthermore, the United States was entitled to acquire additional areas of land or water necessary for canal operations and held the option of exercising eminent domain in Panama City. Within this territory Washington gained \\"all the rights, power, and authority . . . which the United States would possess and exercise if it were the sovereign ... to the entire exclusion\\" of Panama. The Republic of Panama became a de facto protectorate of the larger country through two provisions whereby the United States guaranteed the independence of Panama and received in return the right to intervene in Panama's domestic affairs. For the rights it obtained, the United States was to pay the sum of US$10 million and an annuity, beginning 9 years after ratification, of US$250,000 in gold coin. The United States also purchased the rights and properties of the French canal company for US$40 million. Colombia was the harshest critic of United States policy at the time. A reconciliatory treaty with the United States providing an indemnity of US$25 million was finally concluded between these two countries in 1921 and finally by 1922. Ironically, however, friction resulting from the events of 1903 was greatest between the United States and Panama. Major disagreements arose concerning the rights granted to the United States by the treaty of 1903 and the Panamanian constitution of 1904. The United States government subsequently interpreted these rights to mean that the United States could exercise complete sovereignty over all matters in the Canal Zone. Panama, although admitting that the clauses were vague and obscure, later held that the original concession of authority related only to the construction, operation, and defense of the canal and that rights and privileges not necessary to these functions had never been relinquished.

He actively promoted the reunification of Christians (he was friends with Pope John Paul II),http://www.oca.org/news/1757 dialogue between Christians and people of other beliefs, and the engagement of Christian thinkers with modern thought and society. Biography Olivier-Maurice Clement was born on 17 November 1921, into an agnostic family from the Cevennes. He became a follower of Jesus Christ at the age of thirty, after a long search in atheism and in Asian spiritualities. He had discovered, through reading the Christian philosophers Nicholas Berdyaev and Vladimir Lossky (of whom he would become a student and a friend), the thinking of the Fathers of the ancient, undivided Church, and he received baptism in the Orthodox Church, within the French-speaking diocese of the Moscow Patriarchate in Paris. He described his childhood, spiritual wanderings and conversion in his autobiography, L'Autre Soleil (The Other Sun) (ed. Stock 1986). As a history professor, he taught at the Louis-le-Grand lyceum in Paris for a long time. As a professor of the St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute (Institut Saint-Serge) he became one of the most highly regarded witnesses to Orthodox Christianity, as well as one of the most prolific. He was a founder of the Orthodox Fellowship in Western Europe, and was the author of thirty books on the life, thought and history of the Orthodox Church, and their meeting with other Christians, the non-Christian religions and modernity. He was responsible for the theological journal, Contacts, and became a Doctor honoris causa at the Institute for theology in Bucharest and at the Catholic University in Louvain. Within the scope of his teaching activities, Olivier Clement was particularly engaged in the life and testimony of the Orthodox Church in France. He also inspired the work of the Orthodox Fellowship in Western Europe from its founding in the early 1960s and participated in Orthodox Christian conferences in western Europe from 1971, when every third year Orthodox Christians from the four corners the continent would meet to pray and reflect together. Among contemporary Orthodox theologians he was one who gave most attention to questions of modernity; which he sought to answer through a powerful and poetic reflection, rooted in the tradition of the Church as well as creative and renewing. He was an interlocutor with several great spiritual leaders of his time - Saint Sophrony of Maldon monastery in Britain, Patriarch Athenagoras, Pope John Paul II, theologian Dumitru Staniloae, Brother Roger of Taizé, Andrea Riccardi, founder of the Sant'Egidio community - with all of whom he formed a relationship of trust and friendship. He died on 15 January 2009.

By 1957 missionary students had been phased out. The diocese permitted the school to become a secondary school, without missionary programs, to serve as a feeder school for the Agricultural College. The school offered subjects such as technical drawing, woodwork, metalwork, physics, chemistry, botany, and economics which were not then common in many schools at that time and were seen as an important grounding for agricultural students.

He was created a Life Peer in 1990. Education Haslam was educated at Bolton School and Birmingham University where he gained a first-class degree in mining engineering. Career In 1944 was recruited by Manchester Collieries as a trainee, starting as a pit boy and working underground for three years, including eighteen months at the coalface, in a number of Lancashire collieries. He obtained his colliery manager's certificate in June 1947, six months after the coal industry was nationalised. In October 1947 he joined the technical service department of the Nobel division of Imperial Chemical Industries in Glasgow and spent ten years there. During this time he rose to staff manager of a team of mining engineers and explosive experts working in mines around the world. In Egypt he blew up the cofferdam to enable building of the Aswan Dam.

Built on the site of an earlier, smaller flour mill, which itself replaced an iron forge—one of many in the Crawley area—it fell into disuse in the 1930s. The local council, which acquired the land for housing development in the 1970s, leased the mill to local enthusiasts, who restored it to working order. The mill and an associated house are listed buildings, and there is also a cottage (not listed) on the site. History of the site The area around Ifield was originally thickly wooded, forming part of St Leonard's Forest. Small brooks and tributaries of the River Mole run through the soil, which is an area of Weald clay between the sandier soil to the south and a narrow outcrop of limestone further north. At least one mill had been established in the village by the 13th century, although this was further north. No records of its ownership survive, but tithe documents refer to it several times and it may have belonged to the Lord of the Manor. An iron forge existed on the site by the late 16th century. The Lord of the Manor owned the section of Ifield Brook (a tributary of the Mole) which ran from the furnace at nearby Bewbush, to the southwest. The brook was dammed in the 16th century to form a mill pond, which provided power for the forge. By 1606, \\"a house, barn, mill, mill pond and two crofts of land known as Ifield Mill and Ifield Mill Pond\\"Quoted in the deeds of the mill. had been established. The Middletons, a rich local family who owned many ironworks across Sussex, leased the mill and its associated buildings. They were also tenants of the Bewbush furnace. The Sussex iron industry declined quickly in the mid-17th century. Bewbush furnace closed in 1642 because the area had been completely deforested and there was no more wood to use for fuel; the following year, as the English Civil War raged, Parliamentarians overran the area and destroyed all remnants of the industry. The site of Ifield forge was cleared, and a corn mill was built in its place. (At the time, the generic name \\"mill\\" was used to describe forges, and their operators were called \\"millers\\" or \\"farmers\\". This makes it difficult to determine exactly when the change happened.) It was definitely operating by 1660, when a local Quaker, William Garton, operated it. He was regularly imprisoned for his religious beliefs over the next 25 years, even though Ifield was a hotbed of Nonconformism (being the site of one of the first Quaker meeting houses in the world). The mill was a small-scale operation at first, but as the milling process became more efficient it was able to expand. It was rebuilt in 1683. The Middleton family owned the mill and its associated buildings outright by this time; another prosperous local businessman, Leonard Gale, bought it in 1715. By 1759 it had passed out of his family and began a 50-year period in which various combinations of partners owned it. By this time it was the largest corn mill in the area; when Napoleon threatened to invade the United Kingdom, a survey was undertaken to determine the output of all mills, which found that Ifield Mill could supply 16 sacks of flour and 120 loaves of bread each day. Other local mills could manage no more than four sacks per day. Despite its efficient output, the mill fell into disuse in the 1810s after London-based businessman Abraham Goldsmid bought it in 1809. It lay unused for eight years until Thomas Durrant, a miller from nearby Merstham, bought it for £1,200 in 1817. Durrant was the first owner who also acted as miller, and under his ownership the mill was completely rebuilt. Reconstruction Ifield Brook as it flows into the mill pond The 1683 building was demolished and the structure which stands today was built in its place. A decorative stone tablet with the date 1683 and the initials of Thomas Middleton and his wife Mary was salvaged and mounted on the exterior. (Middleton was the owner at the time of the 1683 rebuilding.) Thomas Durrant spent £3,500 on construction. This money came from successful litigation against a group of miners whose actions damaged the water supply to his mill at Merstham and rendered it useless; a similar problem started to affect the Ifield mill soon after it was rebuilt. The water supply began to fail as the brook's flow became weaker, and in 1848 the mill pond was cut in half by the building of the railway line to Horsham. This originally crossed it on a bridge, but an embankment soon replaced it. Also, in 1837, a competing windmill had been built near the centre of the village, and two other millers were recorded in Ifield parish by 1821. Gradual decline continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries; the mill passed through many owners, and even one long-established family of owner-millers, the Hardings, struggled. A steam engine driven by a waterwheel had been installed, but the engine often had to be worked manually because the water power was so feeble. The mill was no longer in use by 1927, and it was put up for sale with the adjacent Mill Cottage in 1934. Described as \\"a gentleman's residence with a picturesque disused water mill\\", it was clear that the mill's importance had ebbed away. Restoration Looking south over the mill pond The mill stood unused, apart from for storage, and nominally for sale until Crawley Borough Council used a compulsory purchase order to buy it in 1974. The council was acquiring land on the edge of Ifield for housing. It allowed a group of volunteers to attempt to restore the mill, which was in poor structural condition. Work started on 15 June 1974. All parts of the structure were affected by the neglect and long period of disuse. Trees had invaded the building, dislodging the roof; the main timbers holding the building up were rotting and needed replacement; a retaining wall had collapsed inwards; and the water wheel, while still sound, was embedded in the mud. The work took eight years—much longer than the original estimate of three, although large donations of money paid for many interior fittings which had not been taken into account. Three staircases, the board cladding on the inside walls and the wooden floors were all renewed, and all windows were refitted to their original design. On the exterior, the weatherboarding was removed and a layer of waterproof cladding installed. Much of the boardwork had to be replaced, although the original appearance was preserved. The roof was also repaired inside and out to prevent it decaying any further. Replacing the load-bearing timbers and supports was particularly difficult. The whole building had to be lifted with hydraulic jacks and suspended aloft temporarily while new timbers were installed. Work on the water wheel and its surrounding brick structure was also difficult and took several years. Parts of the wheel were salvaged and incorporated into the rebuilt oak and steel structure. The walls supporting it were totally rebuilt at the same time. A sluice gate was built across the mill pond, and a flow control mechanism was brought in from the disused Hammonds Mill in Burgess Hill, also in West Sussex. The wheel is of the overshot type—the largest such wheel in Sussex—weighs around , has a diameter of and can rotate at between 8 and 15 revolutions per minute depending on water flow. Despite its scale and the difficulty of many of the tasks, the restoration was carried out almost entirely by volunteers working mostly at weekends. Some unemployed people enrolled in a job creation programme were briefly used, but no professional engineers, construction personnel or other qualified workers were employed at any time during the eight-year process. The wooden parts of the waterwheel in this reconstruction rotted after about 30 years, so with some financial help from the Lottery Heritage Fund a new waterwheel was constructed in steel. Efforts have been made to improve the ecological and wildlife balance of the mill pond and the surrounding area. The northern part of the pond had to be drained in 1976 during the reconstruction work, and trees started to become established in the bed; the part south of the railway line, meanwhile, was described as a \\"virtual desert\\" ecologically. By 1979, however, it had been restocked with more than 30,000 fish, and birds quickly became established again: a study recorded 58 species. The soil is considered to be of good quality, which improves the chances of suitable vegetation becoming established. Architecture Ifield Water Mill is a tall, externally weatherboarded structure of three storeys, consisting of a brick-built ground floor and two gabled upper floors of timber. The slate roof has eaves carried out beyond the walls on brackets. The mill hoist, whose surrounding timberwork and brickwork was found to be very badly corroded during the restoration, projects from the north face. Current activities Ifield Mill House Ifield Water Mill was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 21 June 1948. It is one of 79 Grade II structures, and 100 listed buildings of all grades, in the Borough of Crawley. The Borough Council still own the building, but it is leased to Crawley Museum Society. Before Crawley Museum was established in Goffs Park in the Southgate neighbourhood, a temporary museum and exhibition was housed in the mill. The mill house and cottage were also bought by the council as part of their land acquisition programme, and have been leased to private tenants since then. The mill house, a 16th-century half-timbered building with modern additions in brick, is now a public house. It has an original tiled hipped roof, but much of the building was remodelled in the 20th century in the style of the old structure. It was listed at Grade II on 1 May 1974. The cottage is not listed separately by English Heritage. It was built in the 16th or 17th century as a barn, but was converted to residential use in the 1930s.

Open building design seeks to co-ordinate inputs from different professions, users of the building, and other interests associated with the locality. History John Habraken first articulated the principles of open building in his book Supports: An Alternative to Mass Housing, published in Dutch in 1961 and in English in 1972 and 1999, and in many other languages.N. John Habraken, Supports: An Alternative to Mass Housing, Scheltema and Holkema, N.V., 1961; Praeger, New York, 1972 (re-published by The Urban International Press, UK, 1999) He argued that housing must always recognize two domains of action: the action of the community and that of the individual inhabitant. When the inhabitant is excluded, the result is uniformity and rigidity. When only the individual takes action, the result may be chaos and conflict. This formulation of a necessary balance of control had implications for all parties in the housing process, including architects. A research foundation was established in 1965 at the SAR (Stichting Architecten Research) in Eindhoven, the Netherlands to explore the ramifications, for architects, of the views laid out in that book. Habraken was invited to be Director of the SAR. Later, in the 1980s, a research group (OBOM) was formed at TU Delft under the direction of Professor Age van Randen, the goal of which was to study the practical issues of implementing the ideas in practice.Ed. E. Vreedenburg. Tangled Building, Untangled Building. TU Delft Werkgroep OBOM, 1992 From the late 1960s onward, a number of pioneering projects were completed in the Netherlands, the UK, Japan Fukao, Seiichi. “History of Developments Toward Open Building in Japan”. Proceedings: Education for an Open Architecture, ed. Kendall; Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana. 2008 and elsewhere. This history is recounted in part in Housing for the Millions: John Habraken and the SAR (1960–2000).Bosma, van Hoogstraaten and Vos, NIA Publishers, 2000 Frans van der Werf, a Dutch architect, was one of the early pioneers.Van der Werf, Frans. Open Ontwerpen. Uitgeverij 010, 1993 A number of other books have been published specifically on the subject, dozens of technical reports have been produced in several languages, open building is referred to in countless books, scholarly papers, dissertations, and articles in professional journals, and in-depth country reports and studies have emerged in Finland, the Netherlands, the US and Japan. Residential Open Building E.F. Spon, 2000 was published in 2000, telling in more detail about the pioneering projects and the principles underlying their implementation. This book has been translated into Japanese.Japanese edition; Shin Murakami, editor. Gihodoshuppan, 2006 Widespread interest in these concepts and their practical implementation led to the formation of an international commission.CIB W104 Open Building Implementation This group was formed in 1996, under the auspices of the CIB (International Council for Research and Innovation in Building and Construction). Members of the CIB W104 come from many countries including the US, the Netherlands, the UK, Iran, Finland, France, Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa.Stephen Kendall,\\"Reflections on the History and Future of Open Building and the OB Network\\" (pdf), CIB W104, July 2015 This commission's original purpose was twofold. First, it intended to document developments toward open building internationally. Second, it intended to stimulate implementation efforts by disseminating information and by convening international conferences at which government and university researchers, practitioners and others could exchange information and support local initiatives. These activities focused largely on the technical and methodological aspects of residential open building. There were continuing exchanges between colleagues in the less developed countries and developed countries, but the dominant focus was the latter. Between 1996 and 2008, the commission met 14 times, in Delft, Tokyo, Taipei, Washington, DC, Mexico City, Brighton (UK), Helsinki, Paris, Hong Kong, and Muncie, Indiana (USA), on a few occasions with other CIB Commissions, and at several of the triennial CIB World Congresses. The most recent conference in the US (2008) focused on education, and included an international student competition, with winners from Korea, China, Singapore and the USA. Each conference has produced a published book of proceedings, containing a total now of over 300 peer- reviewed papers. State-of-the-art Since the turn of the 21st century, a number of developments in various countries indicate that open building is no longer a speculative idea of a few pioneer practitioners and theorists. It has or is poised to become mainstream. Shopping centers and office buildings are recognized as exhibiting the characteristics of open building.Kendall, Stephen. “Open Building: An Approach to Sustainable Architecture”. Journal of Urban Technology, Volume 6, Number 3, pp 1-16, 1999 An architect, working for a developer, will design a base building that defines public space and common services, leaving space for individual stores or offices, which hire their own architect to fill in their leased space. It appears that no theoretical or methodological work preceded the coming of age of this kind of architecture. The first appearance and subsequent evolution of shopping centers and office buildings progressed pragmatically, as a response to new realities, led by real estate developers and business entities of all kinds. Architects and contractors learned how to provide the needed services, often producing work of exceptional quality. Product manufacturers and their supply chains began introducing suitable products, fabrication and construction methods. New standards and regulations were developed to match the new realities. These developments were international in scope, crossing economic, political, cultural and technical boundaries. Aside from these two building types, many parties – public and private – now ask for residential open building on a regular basis. This is evident in Finland, Poland, Japan, and the Netherlands. In other countries, residential open building – known by many names – is no longer recognized as something unusual. Evidence of this is found in Russia, Switzerland, Germany, China and to a lesser extent in the United States. New examples of housing in less-developed economies, designed by professionals to be incrementally upgraded in a user-controlled process, come to light in Chile, Mexico, and South Africa. Mainstreaming of open building is a response to the pressures, conflicts and waste caused by continued adherence to rigid functionalism – that is, defining functions and designing buildings to fit. Open building is also a pragmatic answer to a state of technical entanglement in buildings that has resulted from the incremental addition, over a long period of time, of new technical systems and the “ownership” of these new systems by different trades who rarely cooperate. These pressures are forcing all parties to reconsider and realign their procurement and investment practices, their design methods, and their regulatory systems. In mass- consumer societies, attitudes toward the sphere of control exercised by inhabitants in the making and transformation of environments are changing, vis-à-vis the role of large corporations, governments and communities. The idea that investments should consider long-term asset value is also forcing all parties to learn to make buildings–especially but not limited to multi- occupant buildings – that can adjust as technologies, social patterns, and preferences–both individual and community – continue to evolve. These changes in attitude and priorities are taking the force of law. In part this can be explained by the widespread–and parallel - adoption of a sustainability agenda. In 2008 the Japanese parliament passed new laws mandating 200 year housing, accompanying the legislation with a set of regulatory and administrative tools for use by local building officials who have the responsibility to evaluate and approve building projects. Projects approved under the new law receive a reduced rate of taxation. In Finland, one of the largest real estate companies develops open building projects for their residential portfolio. In the Netherlands, a number of companies–from product manufacturers to developers to architects–implement open building by other names. In Warsaw, Poland, open building is known as the “Warsaw Standard”. In San Francisco, residential developers build “bulk” housing, ready to be fitted out individually. Around the world, old office buildings that have retained their social and economic value are converted to residential occupancy, after being “gutted” to prepare them for new uses and layouts. Besides shopping centers, office buildings and housing, open building is also evident in the health care facilities sector in the United States, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, among other countries. Hospital clients can no longer afford to let short-term functional programs drive facilities procurement methods and investment decisions. They demand “change-ready” facilities, assessed by their accommodation capacity over time, rather than short-term functional performance. These projects, often large and complex and providing mixed-use space for housing, offices, commerce, health care and other uses, are recognized as having the systemic properties of large private (or public) infrastructures. They involve many decision-making bodies and users over long time periods and often implicate numerous territories. As such, they present technical, economic, political and cultural questions that go beyond the architectural discourse that tends to emphasize the special case, formal gymnastics, and the self-expression of the designer or client. These developments toward open building are not taking place for their ideological purity but for pragmatic reasons. Open building implementation implies a new approach to architectural education. A number of schools of architecture around the world (TU Delft, Ball State University in the US, The University of Hong Kong, Southeast University in China, National Cheng-kung University in Taiwan, Shibaura Institute of Technology in Tokyo, University of Florence, University of Pretoria, among others) are experimenting with it.\\"Education for an Open Architecture\\", Ball State University Because open building rejects functionalism, educators who teach open building help students develop skills in making built form, at various levels of intervention that can accommodate changing function.Scott Brown, Denise; Venturi, Robert. Architecture as Signs and Systems: For a Mannerist Time. Belknap Press, Harvard University, 2004 Open building implementation also implies new business models for the delivery of fit-out as integrated design- build packages, serving the consumer market. These companies, now operating in Finland, the Netherlands and Japan, operate with advanced IT support, advanced logistics, and showrooms with electronic and physical samples of products, and with trained installers.\\"A Residential Infill Industry\\", Ball State University Open building terminology Levels: specific spheres of control in the built environment. The built environment can be seen as having an hierarchical structure in which higher levels serve as the setting and context in which lower levels operate. As such, higher levels exercise dominance over lower levels, while lower levels are dependant on higher-level structures. Examples of levels include urban design and architecture, or base building and fit- out.Habraken, John. The Structure of the Ordinary. MIT Press, 1998 Base building: the part of a multi-tenant building that directly serves and affects all occupants. In conventional North American practice, base buildings are constructed by speculative office building developers, leaving choice and responsibility for the remainder of the building — the fit-out — to occupants. The base building normally includes the building's primary structure; the building envelope (roof and facade) in whole or part; public circulation and fire egress(lobbies, corridors, elevators and public stairs); and primary mechanical and supply systems (electricity, heating and air conditioning, telephone, water supply, drainage, gas, etc.) up to the point of contact with individual occupant spaces. Base buildings provide serviced space for occupancy; Supports is another term for base building. Fit-out (tenant work): the physical products and spaces controlled by the individual inhabitant or occupant used to make habitable space in a base building. Fit-out can change without forcing the base building to change. Capacity: the measurable quality of a base building to accommodate a range of variations in floor plan and use within the constraints of a given base building. More generally, capacity concerns the degree of Open Building freedom offered by a higher level to a lower level. ReferencesExternal links * N.

The English Opens Doors programme was launched in 2003 and has been constantly supported since the first government of President Michelle Bachelet. In 2014, the English Opens Doors Programme was transferred from the Curriculum and Evaluation Unit to the Division of General Education. This structural change reflects the Educational Reform of the second Bachelet government, as the Programme has been tasked with carrying out the English component of the reform and reaching 1000 schools over the course of Bachelet's term. Activities=National Volunteer Center Sponsored by the United Nations Development Program and the English Opens Doors Program (EODP) of the Ministry of Education, the National Volunteer Center seeks native and near-native English speakers to work as English teaching assistants in public schools throughout Chile. The National Volunteer Center runs a fee- free volunteer program. The full-time volunteer program began in 2004 with a pilot project consisting of 14 volunteers placed in the Antofagasta Region. The project was evaluated by the Adolfo Ibáñez University Business School. The number of volunteers has considerably extended, and the program now covers all regions of Chile, with the specific focus of benefiting socially-vulnerable school communities. The National Volunteer Center annually recruits approximately 200 - 300 international English speaking volunteers to work in partnership with Chilean English teachers, helping students develop their communicative English abilities through dynamic and game-based learning. Since 2004, over 2,100 English-speaking volunteers have been assigned to schools in every region of Chile, including the islands of Rapa Nui, Chiloe, and more. Over 650 municipal and state-subsidised private establishments have benefited from the program. English summer and winter camps Total immersion English camps take place during students' summer and winter holidays. Camps are designed to give Chilean public secondary school students the chance to practise English through interactive activities including role-playing exercises, group projects, and competitive games. Debate, public speaking and spelling bee competitions Each year, the English Opens Doors Programme sponsors debate competitions for high school students, public speaking competitions for students in year 7 and year 8, and spelling bee competitions for students in year 5 and year 6. Students are expected to prepare and present material entirely in English and to compete at local and regional events in order to advance to the national finals, held in Santiago. Scholarships In 2006, President Bachelet officially announced a government-funded scholarship for undergraduates pursuing an EFL teaching degree at private and public accredited Chilean universities. This scholarship has now been incorporated into Sistema Bicentenario BECAS Chile. The main objective was the creation of a \\"long-term, comprehensive policy\\" for professional and academic development abroad. The scholarship enables Chilean undergraduates in their penultimate year of university to improve their English-language skills and become familiar with a foreign culture. It is the only scholarship the Chilean government grants to undergraduate students and is designed 'to provide Chilean schools with high-quality professionals, thereby improving English-language education'. The destination country must be one in which English is either an official language or is used widely enough that the Chilean student will be experiencing total immersion. All scholarship applicants undergo a rigorous selection process that includes taking an English-language proficiency test such as the TOEFL or IELTS. Professional development for EFL teachers The English Opens Doors Programme has developed several strategies to provide EFL teachers in public schools with more professional development opportunities, helping them to improve their English-language fluency and teaching practices. These include English language and methodology courses, local teachers' networks where peers form communities of collaboration, English Summer Town and English Winter Retreat (annual total immersion seminars where foreign professionals share their expertise with EFL teachers), among others. Mandarin Chinese teaching programme In 2005, just prior to the China-Chile free trade agreement, the Ministry of Education developed a programme that allows educators to incorporate Mandarin Chinese into the curriculum, which is also managed by the English Opens Doors Programme. Native Chinese speaking trained teachers spend up to two years at a public or semi-private Chilean school teaching Chinese as a foreign language and developing initiatives such as dialogues and immersion camps.

Freeze stats can be used on both refrigerant-to-air, and refrigerant-to-liquid type heat exchangers and serve different purposes with similar goals for each.  Air coil  The purpose of an air coil freeze stat is to keep the refrigerant- to-air heat exchanger (commonly called air coils) from freezing. This kind of freeze stat is typically used for heating coils which are exposed to outside air and is usually installed on the supply air side of the coil. To accomplish this, they typically shut down the flow of outside air to a mixing box when the temperature reaches a predetermined setpoint. The setpoint for air coil freeze stats is typically about 12°C which is approximately when the dew point temperature of the air starts to drop below freezing point.The Freeze Stat John Williams Jr., Carrier Corporation, The Air Conditioning, Heating, Refrigeration News, July 2001Freeze Protection Problems  Water coil The water coil freeze stat performs a similar function to the air coil freeze stat, but is used on a different type of HVAC system. Its function is to keep the freon-to-liquid heat exchanger (commonly called liquid coils) from freezing. In practical situations, when an air coil freeze stat is not used, bypassed, or defeated, the air coil can freeze, and this causes a lack of air flow to the facility. By contrast, when a water coil freeze stat is not used, the water coil can get so cold that it can freeze the cooling liquid in the exchanger and burst the exchanger. A ruptured heat exchanger mixes contaminants such as freon and oil into the coolant. The intrusion of coolant into the delicately balanced refrigeration system can cause expensive damage to components such as the freon compressor, and the reversing valve. Mechanical Mechanical freeze stat Conceptually, mechanical freeze stats are constructed with a diaphragm, a capillary tube and bulb, and an electric switch.Combination Temperature Sensors Trygve Behny, Minco, Electronic Design (eepn),September 2006 The capillary tube allows gas movement to and from the capillary bulb and the diaphragm with a fall or rise in temperature, respectively. When the temperature reaches a specific setpoint, the pressure in the diaphragm will trip a switch which typically shuts down the flow of outside air while the capillary bulb's temperature is at or below the setpoint. Mechanical freeze stats can have more than one set of contacts, and the contacts can be NO or NC. Disadvantages * Capillary tube easily kinked during installation limiting effectiveness * Sensing bulb must be mounted horizontally * Diaphragm case must be mounted in a separate, warmer location for effective operation Advantages * Typically inexpensive * Easily understood wiring Digital Digital freeze stat Digital freeze stats, also known as electronic or solid state freeze stats, use an electronic circuit, microprocessor, or microcontroller in place of the mechanical freeze stat's diaphragm and switch. They also use one or more electric or electronic sensors in place of the capillary tube and bulb for temperature sensing. Digital freeze stats utilizing microcontrollers or microprocessors can also perform more advanced functions than simply opening or closing switch contacts. Digital freeze stats can perform seemingly intelligent operations such as reversing the refrigerant flow and using some building heat to thaw a freon-to-liquid heat exchanger and then restoring the refrigerant flow to its normal direction once the danger of freezing the water coil has been averted. Disadvantages * Requires power to operate * Typically higher cost than mechanical freeze stats * More complex wiring installation Advantages * Multiple sensors * Sensors can be near or far * No capillary tube kinking issue * No capillary tube leaking issue * Operate in any position * Operate in varying temperatures * Programmable actions and setpoints * Can perform functions other than opening or closing a single switch See also * Crankcase heater * Heat exchanger * Reversing valve * Thermal expansion valve * Thermostat References Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning ","title":"Freeze stat"},{"id":"21365821","text":"Robert \\"Bob\\" Thomas Hanford Leivers (27 December 1914 - 28 August 1964) was an English freestyle swimmer who competed for Great Britain in the 1932 Summer Olympics and in the 1936 Summer Olympics.

The convention is a cross-party, cross-sector association with support both in Cornwall and elsewhere. It is not campaigning for any form of separatism or independence.Senedh Kernow The convention had been meeting for some time prior to November 2000 as an informal discussion group. In less than two years, it had attracted the signatures of \\"about 50,000\\" people on a petition calling for a referendum on a Cornish Assembly, which is a little over 10% of the total Cornish electorate. A delegation led by the West Cornwall Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament (MP) Andrew George and representatives of the convention, (Richard Ford, Dick Cole, David Fieldsend and Andrew Climo) presented the declaration to 10 Downing Street on Wednesday 12 December 2001. Position According to the 2001 petition, \\"We, the People of Cornwall, must have a greater say in how we are governed. We need a Cornish Assembly that can set the right democratic priorities for Cornwall and provide a stronger voice for our communities in Britain, in Europe and throughout the wider world.\\" In this, the Cornish Constitutional Convention sits within the milieu of increased desire for greater autonomy by European regions. Given Cornwall's geographical peripherality, economic status, cultural and linguistic circumstances it is unsurprising that Cornwall has a devolutionary movement. Unlike the Scottish Constitutional Convention, which had the support of much of the political establishment of Scotland including formal membership of political parties, churches and civic groups, the CCC is more akin to the Scottish Convention's predecessor, the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly. History Formed in November 2000, the convention states that its key objectives are to: * Establish a devolved Assembly for Cornwall (Senedh Kernow) * Develop cross-party, cross-sector consensus * Establish a form of modern governance which strengthens Cornwall, her role in the affairs of the country * Positively address the problems that have arisen through growing isolation and loss of confidence.

God vs. the Gavel, page 296 (Cambridge University Press 2005): \\"The symbol of the judicial system, seen in courtrooms throughout the United States, is blindfolded Lady Justice.\\"Fabri, The challenge of change for judicial systems, page 137 (IOS Press 2000): \\"the judicial system is intended to be apolitical, its symbol being that of a blindfolded Lady Justice holding a balanced scales.\\" Her attributes are a blindfold, a beam balance, and a sword. She often appears as a pair with Prudentia, who holds a mirror and a snake. Lady Justice originates from the personification of Justice in Ancient Roman art known as Iustitia or Justitia after , who is equivalent to the Greek goddesses Themis and Dike. The goddess Iustitia The origin of Lady Justice was Iustitia, the goddess of Justice within Roman mythology. Iustitia was introduced by emperor Augustus, and was thus not a very old deity in the Roman pantheon. Justice was one of the virtues celebrated by emperor Augustus in his clipeus virtutis, and a temple of Iustitia was established in Rome on 8 January 13 BC by emperor Tiberius. Iustitia became a symbol for the virtue of justice with which every emperor wished to associate his regime; emperor Vespasian minted coins with the image of the goddess seated on a throne called Iustitia Augusta, and many emperors after him used the image of the goddess to proclaim themselves protectors of justice. Though formally called a goddess with her own temple and cult shrine in Rome, it appears that she was from the onset viewed more as an artistic symbolic personification rather than as an actual deity with religious significance. Depiction The Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead depicts a scene in which a deceased person's heart is weighed against the feather of truth. The personification of justice balancing the scales dates back to the goddess Maat, and later Isis, of ancient Egypt. The Hellenic deities Themis and Dike were later goddesses of justice. Themis was the embodiment of divine order, law, and custom, in her aspect as the personification of the divine rightness of law. Scales Lady Justice is most often depicted with a set of scales typically suspended from one hand, upon which she measures the strengths of a case's support and opposition. The Greek goddess Dike is depicted holding a set of scales. Bacchylides, Fragment 5 (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric IV) (Greek lyric c. 5th B.C.): > If some god had been holding level the balance of Dike (Justice). The scales represent the weighing of evidence, and the scales lack a foundation in order to signify that evidence should stand on its own. Blindfold Castellania Since the 16th century, Lady Justice has often been depicted wearing a blindfold. The blindfold represents impartiality, the ideal that justice should be applied without regard to wealth, power, or other status. The earliest Roman coins depicted Justitia with the sword in one hand and the scale in the other, but with her eyes uncovered.See \\"The Scales of Justice as Represented in Engravings, Emblems, Reliefs and Sculptures of Early Modern Europe\\" in G. Lamoine, ed., Images et representations de la justice du XVie au XIXe siècle (Toulouse: University of Toulose-Le Mirail, 1983)\\" at page 8. Justitia was only commonly represented as \\"blind\\" since the middle of the 16th century. The first known representation of blind Justice is Hans Gieng's 1543 statue on the Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen (Fountain of Justice) in Berne.Image of Lady Justice in Berne. Instead of using the Janus approach, many sculptures simply leave out the blindfold altogether. For example, atop the Old Bailey courthouse in London, a statue of Lady Justice stands without a blindfold;Image of Lady Justice in London. the courthouse brochures explain that this is because Lady Justice was originally not blindfolded, and because her \\"maidenly form\\" is supposed to guarantee her impartiality which renders the blindfold redundant.Colomb, Gregory. Designs on Truth, p. 50 (Penn State Press, 1992). Another variation is to depict a blindfolded Lady Justice as a human scale, weighing competing claims in each hand. An example of this can be seen at the Shelby County Courthouse in Memphis, Tennessee.Image of Lady Justice in Memphis. Sword The sword represented authority in ancient times, and conveys the idea that justice can be swift and final. Toga The Greco-Roman garment symbolizes the status of the philosophical attitude that embodies justice. In computer systems Unicode version 4.1.0 implemented a symbol at code point U+2696 that may be used to represent the scales of justice.

Partington worked in the professional theater in the United States for over fifty years as an actor, production stage manager, director, producer, artistic director and producing director and was active on Broadway as well as professional regional theater. He was instrumental in the establishment of the League of Resident Theatres and played a vital role in the development of regional theater. Career A graduate of Syracuse University, Partington's initial focus was acting, appearing in leading roles throughout college and then in regional theater. Several seasons of leading roles at the Memphis Arena Theater and the Barter Theatre as well as regional tours followed and on December 15, 1954 he made his Broadway debut opposite the great actor/singer Dennis King in Lunatics and Lovers.http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2484 Following Lunatics and Lovers, Partington began dividing his time between acting and stage management. His work as a stage manager brought him opportunities to work with such theatrical luminaries as Thornton Wilder, Moss Hart, David Merrick, Jed Harris, and Tyrone Guthrie. After stage managing the original Broadway productions of The Matchmaker,http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2561 The First Gentlemen, Child of Fortune, and My Fair Lady,http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2407 Partington had the opportunity to work with Orson Welles, Douglas Campbell and Rod Steiger, as both an actor and stage manager, in Welles' theatrical adaptation of the Herman Melville classic, Moby Dick, entitled Moby Dick—Rehearsed.http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2968 Though not a critical success, Moby Dick—Rehearsed is, to this day, considered a great theatrical adaptation and an idiomatic example of Theatrical Minimalism. In December 1962, Partington was contacted by Tyrone Guthrie and asked to join the newly founded Tyrone Guthrie Theatrehttp://www.guthrietheater.org/about_the_guthrie in Minneapolis, Minnesota as its first production manager. It was in this capacity that Partington served for the next five years. It was an historic time for American theater and it was during this period that the League Of Resident Theaters was established and saw unprecedented growth. In 1968, Partington left the Guthrie and established his own theatrical company, Heartland Productions. Based out of the newly opened Southwest Minnesota State College in Marshall, Minnesota, Heartland Productions was a professional Equity company whose focus was both theatrical classics as well as new dramatic works. Additionally, the company toured throughout the mid-west bringing live professional theater to rural areas. Heartland Productions enjoyed two successful seasons until underwriting was withdrawn and the company was forced to disband. In 1970, Partington assumed the artistic leadership of the Cleveland Play House but that was a short-lived, for early in 1971, his friend and colleague Robert Porterfield, founder of the Barter Theatre, asked him to come to Virginia and take over artistic responsibilities for the world-famous Barter. Porterfield's health was failing and following his death in October 1971, Partington was officially named Producing Artistic Director of the Barter Theatre. For the next twenty years, under Partington's leadership, the Barter Theatre continued its legacy as America's oldest professional theater. In 1992, Partington retired as Producing Artistic Director of the Barter Theatre and he, his wife, actress Cleo Holladayhttp://www.cleoholladay.com moved to the Mexican Gulf coastal town of Apalachicola, Florida. There, the Partingtons purchased and completely renovated the Dixie Theatre,http://www.dixietheatre.com a theater originally built in 1912. In 1998 the Dixie Theatre opened with professional Equity productions of Sylvia and Driving Miss Daisy. In January 2004, Dixie Partington, Rex Partington's youngest child, took over as Producing Director. It is a 501c3 Not-For-Profit Theater. Rex Partington was a longstanding member of both The Players Club and The Lambs Club. Personal life Partington was born in Newark, New Jersey on March 15, 1924. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II as a paratrooper in the historic 101st Airborne Division. He saw action in Europe and following the end of the war was assigned to General Eisenhower's Elite Guard. He was married to actress Cleo Holladay on September 26, 1953. They had two children. He died on March 17, 2006, in Panama City, Florida.

His debut film Enclosure was entered into the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival where he won the Silver Prize for Best Director. Two years later, his film El Otro Cristóbal was entered into the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. In 2013 he was awarded the Grand prix du théâtre de l'Académie française. Biography One of the most acclaimed theater writer/directors of the 20th century, Gatti was originally a member of the informal Left Bank group of filmmakers that included Alain Resnais, Chris Marker, Agnès Varda, Henri Colpi and Jean Cayrol, but because none of his films have been released on video in the US, he remains an elusive figure for many cinephiles. He appears in Resnais' Toute la mémoire du monde (1956) and in Marker's Immemory CD-Rom; he wrote China (1956) for Marker's Petite Planète collection and traveled with Marker in the making of Letter from Siberia (1957), which inspired his book Siberia — Zero + Infinity the following year. According to his 1989 biographer, Dorothy Knowles, Gatti was born in 1924 in a shantytown in Monaco to Auguste Rainier an Italian anarchist from Piedmont, who escaped murder in a Chicago slaughterhouse because of his political activities and fled Benito Mussolini's regime and to Letizia Lusona a maid. During World War II, Gatti joined a small French resistance maquis. Captured, tortured, and sentenced to a concentration camp in Hamburg where he was forced to work in a diving bell at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, Gatti eventually escaped and joined a British Special Air Service special forces team. After the war, he worked as an award-winning journalist for many years until he traveled with Marker, published his first plays, and directed his first film, Enclosure (L'Enclos, 1961). L'Enclos was screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival but it was hailed by Truffaut, Resnais, Cocteau and others. He was awarded the French Legion of Honour in 1999, the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2004 and the Grand prix du théâtre from the Académie française in 2013.

It is one of the two Shakti Peethas in Pakistan, other being Hinglaj Mata mandir Puranas describe that the three eyes (the third eye) of the Goddess fell here after she committed Sati. The Goddess is worshipped as Mahishasuramardini, or the slayer of the Demon Mahishasur. Her consort, the Hindu God Shiva, is worshipped in Ragi form as Krodhish, personification of anger. Shivaharkaray is third in the list of 51 Peethas identified in the Puranas. Legend Sati was the first wife of Shiva and first incarnation of Parvati. She was the daughter of King Daksha and Queen (the daughter of Brahma). She was insulted and hurt by her father not inviting both her and her husband to a yagna, and so she committed self-immolation at its sacrificial fire in grief. Shiva was distraught after hearing of her death, and danced around the world in a Tandav Nritya (“devastating penance” or dance of destruction), carrying her body on his shoulders. In order to return Shiva to normalcy, Vishnu used his Sudarshan Chakra, the rotating blade on his finger tip. He dismembered the body of Sati into several pieces, and wherever a piece fell on the earth, its location was consecrated as a divine shrine, or Shakthi Peeth, with deities of Sati (Parvati) and Shiva. These locations have become famous pilgrimage places as Pithas or Shakthi Pithas, and are scattered throughout the subcontinent, including in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, and India. Sati is also known as Devi or Shakthi. With the blessing of Vishnu she was reborn as the daughter of Himavat or Himalayas, and hence named Parvati, or daughter of mountains. She was born on the 14th day of the bright half of the month of Mrigashīrsha, which marks the Shivarathri, the night festival of Shiva.

Background Large bodies of water appealed to several aviation pioneers in the first two decades of the 20th century since they offered large spaces for takeoff and emergency landings. Builders also anticipated naval interest. It emerged that one of the main problems was getting the floats to leave the water, that is to \\"unstick\\". The first seaplane to fly, on 28 March 1910 at Martigues, France was built by Henri Fabre, though the machine built by Glenn Curtiss and first flown on 26 January 1911 was the first practical seaplane. In England A.V.Roe & Co had put the first Type D on floats and it left the water on 18 November 1911 at Barrow-in-Furness using stepped floats, but dropped back into the water and was damaged. It flew successfully in April 1912, although it was underpowered. Development The Lakes Water Bird was built in 1911 for E.W. Wakefield, of the Lakes Flying Company, Windermere by A.V. Roe, who would build aircraft to the designs of individual customers. It was built as a landplane with the intention of converting it to a seaplane once testing was complete. Wakefield had been interested in waterborne aircraft since 1909 and had performed experiments with different float designs towed at speed across Lake Windermere. Unsticking problems persisted until he visited Henri Fabre in France and got useful advice on float design. The 12 ft (3.66 m) long float for the Water Bird followed Glen Curtiss' float and was built by boat builders Borwick of Bowness-on-Windermere using mahogany with aluminium and canvas.Letter from H.F. Cowley to Flight, 30 November 1961, p857 Avro built the aircraft in Manchester, transporting it to Brooklands for its first flight on 25 May 1911. It was a two-bay single-seat pusher biplane with wings of unequal span. The outer half of each upper wing carried a pair of ailerons; the larger inner one had a semicircular trailing edge extending well behind the wing trailing edge. Bamboo outriggers fore and aft of the wings supported leading elevators and tail surfaces plus rudder. Both elevator and rudder were operated by bamboo pushrods. Power was provided by a 50 hp (37 kW) Gnome Omega seven-cylinder rotary engine driving an 8 ft 6in (2.59 m) propeller. After testing as a landplane at Brooklands in May/June 1911, the Water Bird was brought to Hill of Oaks on Windermere and the float fitted in place of the wheeled undercarriage. A pair of cylindrical floats was mounted below the wingtips for lateral stability on the water. The successful first flight was on 25 November 1911, with ex-Avro school pilot H. Stanley Adams. Operational history Water Bird flew intensively during December 1911 and January 1912, logging some 60 flights. The longest was for 20 miles, reaching 800 ft. In March 1912 Water Bird was destroyed in its lakeside hangar by a storm. Remnants of the aircraft (canard, float, rudder and tailplane) survived. Water Bird was succeeded by the Lakes-built Water Hen, their first complete product. It was initially almost identical to its predecessor apart from straight-edged ailerons. Larger, later modifications removed much of the similarity between the two aircraft, the later Water Hen having a much wider central float.The Water HenFlight 7 December 1912 Specifications References=NotesBibliography 1910s British experimental aircraft ","title":"Lakes Water Bird"},{"id":"21366169","text":"Prof. Dr. Thomas Hoeren (2018) Thomas Hoeren (born on August 22, 1961 in Dinslaken) is a German law professor and a former Court of appeal judge with focus on Information and Media Law.

Life He derived his name, according to John Leland, from the village of Celling, or Selling, some two miles from Faversham in Kent: Edward Hasted assigns him to a family settled at Selling near Hythe.History of Kent, iii. 55. He appears to have been a monk of Christ Church, Canterbury; thence he proceeded to the University of Oxford, where he became a member of the newly founded All Souls College.In the Oxford Register (February 1457-8) William Celling, a Benedictine, figures as B.D. Tanner states that he was a fellow of All Souls at the beginning of Edward IV's reign, but without assigning any authority for the assertion. He left Oxford before the close of 1472, in which year a William Celling was elected abbot of St. Augustine's, Canterbury, but seems to have resigned immediately. He was elected prior of Christ Church, Canterbury, on 10 September 1472. It was presumably subsequent to this that he made his first journey to Italy: Leland states that Celling became acquainted with Politian (born in 1454). While abroad Celling collected Latin and Greek manuscripts, and when he returned to England brought these with him. Among other works were a copy of Cicero's Republic, of St. Cyril's and St. Basil's Commentaries on the Prophets; and the works of Synesius are specially mentioned. For his manuscripts he restored the library over the prior's chapel, but many of his books were destroyed some quarter of a century later in a fire. Celling was a careful manager, clearing the priory of debt and undertaking building work. He charged himself with the education of Thomas Linacre,http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/linacre.htm who is said to have been his pupil at Canterbury, and who certainly accompanied him on his second journey to Italy, an embassy to Rome between 1485 and 1490. In 1490 and 1491 Celling was occupied with Richard Foxe, at that time the bishop of Exeter, in the negotiations between England, France, and Brittany.Rymer, xii. 431, &c.; Some three years later he died on 10 December 1494. He was buried in the martyrium of Thomas Becket, in a richly blazoned tomb, on which was inscribed a long epitaph narrating his embassies to France and Rome.

Decline of Christianity deconsecrated church in Australia, now in use as a restaurant. Declining attendance can lead to the consolidation of congregations and repurposing of church buildings. Historically, the majority of Christians have lived in Western nations, once called Christendom, and often conceptualized as \\"European Christian\\" civilization.Philip Jenkins, from \\"The Christian Revolution,\\" in The Next Christendom: The Coming of Global Christianity, Oxford University Press, 2002. A postchristian society is one in which Christianity is no longer the dominant civil religion but that has gradually assumed values, culture, and worldviews that are not necessarily Christian (and also may not necessarily reflect any world religion's standpoint or may represent a combination of either several religions or none). 'Postchristian' tends to refer to the loss of Christianity's monopoly, if not its followers, in historically Christian societies.http://www.nationalreview.com/article/366263/our-post-christian- society-john-osullivan Postchristian societies are found across the Global North/West: for example, though the 2005 Eurobarometer survey indicated that the majority of Europeans hold some form of belief in a higher power (see also \\"Ietsism\\"); fewer point explicitly to the Christian God. Despite this decline, Christianity remains the dominant religion in Europe and the Americas. According to a 2010 study by the Pew Research Center, 76% of the population of Europe,Including the Asian part of Russia, and excluding the European part of Turkey. Regional distribution of Christians: Europe. Pew Research Center. 77% of North America and 90% of Latin America and the Caribbean identified themselves as Christians. In his 1961 book The Death of God, the French theologian Gabriel Vahanian argued that modern secular culture in most of Western civilization had lost all sense of the sacred, lacked any sacramental meaning, and disdained any transcendental purpose or sense of providence, bringing him to the conclusion that for the modern mind, \\"God is dead\\". Thomas J. J. Altizer and William Hamilton of Emory University drew upon a variety of sources, including the aphorisms of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's Letters and Papers from Prison, and brought this line of thought to public attention in a short- lived intellectual movement of the mid-to-late-1960s among Protestant theologians and ministerial students. Conservative reaction on the right and social-advocacy efforts on the left blunted its impact, however, and it was quickly overlooked in favor of more ethically-oriented movements such as the Social Gospel and feminist theologies, within mainline Protestantism. Alternative perspectives Other scholars have disputed the global decline of Christianity, and instead hypothesized of an evolution of Christianity which allows it to not only survive, but actively expand its influence in contemporary societies. Philip Jenkins hypothesized a \\"Christian Revolution\\" in the Southern nations, such as Africa, Asia and Latin America, where instead of facing decline, Christianity is actively expanding. The susceptibility to Christian teachings in the global South will allow the Christian population in these areas to continually increase, and together with the shrinking of the Western Christian population, will form a \\"new Christendom\\" in which the majority of the world's Christian population can be found in the South.Philip Jenkins, from \\"The Christian Revolution,\\" in The Next Christendom: The Coming of Global Christianity, Oxford University Press, 2002. Charles Taylor, meanwhile, disputes the \\"God is Dead\\" thesis by arguing that the practices and understandings of faith changed long before the late 20th century, along with secularism itself. In A Secular Age Taylor argues that being \\"free from Christendom\\" has allowed Christianity to endure and express itself in various ways, particularly in Western society; he notes that otherwise secular ideas were, and continue to be, formed in light of some manner of faith. He stresses that \\"loss of faith\\" reflects simplistic notions on the nature of secularization, namely the idea of \\"subtraction.\\" Thus \\"post-Christian\\" is, after a fashion, a product of Christianity itself. Other uses Some American Christians (primarily Protestants) also use this term in reference to the evangelism of unchurched individuals who may have grown up in a non- Christian culture where traditional Biblical references may be unfamiliar concepts. This perspective argues that, among previous generations in the United States, such concepts and other artifacts of Christianese would have been common cultural knowledge and that it would not have been necessary to teach this language to adult converts to Christianity. In this sense, post- Christian is not used pejoratively, but is intended to describe the special remediative care that would be needed to introduce new Christians to the nuances of Christian life and practice. Some groups use the term \\"post- Christian\\" as a self-description. Dana McLean Greeley, the first president of the Unitarian Universalist Association, described Unitarian Universalism as postchristian, insofar as Christians no longer considered it Christian, while persons of other religions would likely describe it as Christian, at least historically.Daniel Harper. \\"What is a 'post-Christian'?\\" See also * Apatheism * Christian atheism * Christian existentialism * Cultural Christianity * Ietsism * Postmodern Christianity * Postmodern Reformation * Post-theism * Secular movement ReferencesFurther reading * Liberal Religion in the Post Christian Era, Edward A.

She is venerated mainly is in the coastal provinces of the country, especially along the road from Phnom Penh to the sea port of Sihanoukville, as well as in Kampot and Kep. At the Bokor Mountain in Kampot there is a 29 meters tall monument to Yeay Mao inaugurated in 2012, while there is a young version of Yeay Mao in the Kep Beach called Beautiful Lady (ស្រីស្អាត) or Sela waits for her husband (សិលាចាំប្តី), but that belongs to the legend of Mao looking to the west for her lost husband. She is considered the protector of travelers and hunters. Drivers still stop at her shrine along National Road 4 near Phnom Pech Nil to pay their respects and wash their cars with water from the stream nearby, as well as the monument at Bokor.  History  The history of Yeay Mao is unclear, being composed of several legends and interpretations. There are many popular stories surrounding her. It is said that she was a beautiful lady married to a powerful warrior. When he died, she took control of the armies against the Thai and became a celebrity. The story is placed sometime before the French Colony (1863–1953). Another version says that Yeay Mao was the wife of Ta Krohom-Koh (តាក្រហមក) - literally \\"Grandpa Red Neck\\". They lived in the forest near Pech Nil Mountain (ភ្នំពេជ្រនិល). Once they went around and they met a tiger. Ta Krohom-Koh abandoned his wife and the tiger devoured her. Since then, any traveller who passed by the place of the accident, paid respect to her spirit to avoid a similar fate.Seik Sopat y Sadang Tuo: Colección de Tradiciones Camboyanas (ប្រជុំរឿងព្រេងខ្មែរ), pp.82-83. When they built the highway between Phnom Penh and the sea in what is today Sihanoukville, a small temple was built at the spot. The road was finished by the French in 1876, a fact that increased the pilgrimage to the temple. It included Vietnamese and Chinese believers.  Celebration  Sela waits for her husband (សិលាចាំប្តី), a monument in Kep Province inspired in a version of Yeay Mao, whose husband went to the wars with Thailand and never returns, so she decided to go to the west in his search. The main feast is celebrated in June. The believers go to the Temple or any place destined for the veneration, to bring sacred food, especially pig head, chicken soup, the sla-thoa (ស្លាធម៌) - a coconut adorned with flowers and leaves and used in religious celebrations in Cambodia, the bay-sei (បាយសី)- section of banana tree trunk with legs to which three to nine layers of banana leaves rolled up in finger shape have been attached. It is used also in certain ceremonies. .Seik Sopat and Sadang Tuo: Collection of Cambodian Traditions (ប្រជុំរឿងព្រេងខ្មែរ), pp.80-81. The place of the veneration must be set with three statues: # Yeay Sau (យាយសៅរ៍): A female spirit, that is the wife of Ung (អ៊ុង), the kaporal thnol (កាប៉ូរ៉ាលថ្នល់), guard of the paths. # Ta Snong Long (តាស្នងឡុង): \\"Grandpa Snong Long\\", considered the son of Yeay Sau and Ung. # Long Mao: She is the same \\"Yeay Mao\\".  Beliefs  According to Seik Sopat and Sadang Tuo,Seik Sopat and Sadang Tuo: Collection of Cambodian Traditions (ប្រជុំរឿងព្រេងខ្មែរ), p.78. the story of Yeay Mao dates from 1866, when she was a spirit of cruelty that attacked any traveller that did not pay respects to her at Pech Nil Mountain (ភ្នំពេជ្រនិល). If the person to whom the spirit sent strong pains because ignoring to pay veneration to her, repented, that person was healed. But if that person did not repent, he or she could die. It was also believed that if a person presented his offering asking to hurt an enemy, the spirit used to fulfil the wish.Seik Sopat and Sadang Tuo: Collection of Cambodian Traditions (ប្រជុំរឿងព្រេងខ្មែរ), p.80. In 1900, the French army destroyed the first temple and the divinity came in decadence. During the short Japanese invasion of Cambodia in 1940, the army of that country gathered the farmers of Kampot Province and Vietnamese, Chinese and Cham Cambodians, to dig trenches at the ancient sacred place. According to the legend, the workers desecrated the site, bringing the fury of the spirit. People started to suffer epidemics and many died. They explained these epidemics as the fury of Yeay Mao.Seik Sopat and Sadang Tuo: Collection of Cambodian Traditions (ប្រជុំរឿងព្រេងខ្មែរ), p.79. In order to placate the spirit, the people started again to offer gifts to Yeay Mao and the veneration revived. After the villages near to Pech Nil Mountain, pray to the divinity asking for health and protection. If there was, for example, a theft, they pray to the spirit to punish the criminal.

The SEQUAL framework  The SEQUAL framework is a reference model for evaluating the quality of models, the semiotic quality framework (SEQUAL) developed by John Krogstie.John Krogstie et al. (2006). \\"Process models representing knowledge for action: a revised quality framework\\". In: European Journal of Information Systems (2006) 15, pp.91–102. The SEQUAL framework is grounded in semiotics, particularly the semiotic theory of Charles W. Morris. It builds on semiotic theory and defines several quality aspects based on relationships between a model, a body of knowledge, a domain, a modeling language, and the activities of learning, taking action, and modeling.Jan Mendlin et al. (2006) \\"On the Correlation between Process Model Metrics and Errors\\" Conference paper. Its usefulness was confirmed in a 2002 experiment.D.L. Moody, et al.

Conceptual Modeling - ER 2002, Proceedings, LNCS 2503, pp. 380-396. The basic idea behind the SEQUAL framework is, that conceptual models can be considered as sets of statements in a language, and therefore can be evaluated in semiotic/linguistic terms. A first semiotic framework for evaluating conceptual models was originally proposed by Lindland et al. in the 1994 article \\"Understanding quality in conceptual modeling\\".O.I. Lindland, G. Sindre and Arne Sølvberg (1994) \\"Understanding quality in conceptual modeling\\". In: IEEE Software 11(2), 42–49. In its initial version, it considered three quality levels: * syntactic, * semantic, and * pragmatic quality The framework was later extended, and called the SEQUAL framework by Krogstie et al. in the 1995 article \\"Defining quality aspects for conceptual models\\".KROGSTIE J, LINDLAND OI and SINDRE G (1995) \\"Defining quality aspects for conceptual models\\".

It was established on 17 November 1999. The main activity of KV is to conduct observations of astronomical events, like meteor showers, eclipses, occultation, variable stars and generate scientific data for amateur research. Along with scientific studies, KV is also active in science popularization. Some of the major activities conducted by KV are public star gazing programs, sky at your doorstep, certificate course in amateur astronomy, and science exhibition. History In 1998, the Leonid meteor shower was expected with outburst. Some enthusiastic students from Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad area came together to observe that event scientifically. After observing that glorious event, all of them got inspired to do something different in Amateur Astronomy. They decided to form an official group under which they could come together; discuss on various topics in Astronomy, observe various events in the Sky and contribute to astronomy. Structure There are four main sections Observation sectionPlanetary= Planetary observations are helpful to study changes in the surfaces and study of satellites of planets like Jupiter, Saturn and its rings, Lunar surface and as well as transits and oppositions of planets. These observations are visual and photographic. =Variable stars= Visual observations of variable stars and plotting the light curves. These observations are reporting to the organizations- AAVSO. Khagol Vishwa has formed a special Variable Star Section (VSS) for detailed study in this field. =Occultations= All types of eclipses, occultation of stars by planets and asteroids, lunar occultation, transits, timing these events, photography and CCD observations for study of particular Astronomical body. =Deep sky= This section works for study of faint objects in the night sky. Observations of NGC and Messier objects, comet hunting, photography of deep sky through telescopes. Science popularization section This section works to popularize basic sciences and astronomy in society. Some of the activities under this section are =Khagol Prasar Abhiyaan= Translated as Astronomy Popularization Movement, under this, khagol vishwa conducts lectures on astronomy in schools, colleges as well as open public lectures. There are also Star Gazing Programs once or twice a month. =Pimpri-Chinchwad science congress= A district level science congress is organised every alternate year. The aim of this event is to spread the awareness about fundamental sciences in high school students and to discuss local problems and issues and to encourage students to develop the science and technology to solve them. Research and development section The aim of formation of this section is to create atmosphere of research and development in India on an amateur level. It will be helpful to encourage more students to do something, to find something for our society and nation even if he/she is not with science background and working in different types of fields. Some main projects under progress are ham radio networking for tele- education and communication under emergency, mini weather stations in all main villages for knowing local environment, helpful for students and farmers, creating electricity from bio gas, amateur mobile observatory for deep sky study and study of near Earth objects (NEO), analyzing observations, publishing papers, and making research projects. Instrumentation section Some research can be done better with proper instruments. Khagol Vishwa tries to buy instruments necessary for its activities and to make them available to students and members. Some of these instruments are made by members themselves under the Research and Development section. Lonar conservation project Khagol Vishwa is one of the few organisations in India which is working to create awareness about Lonar crater lake and also to campaign against its environmental degradation. The organization has been studying the site for past eight years and published the first report two years ago. Aspects of Lonar crater which have been studied are: geology and structure, ecology - flora, fauna, agriculture, zoology, sociology, water level and pollution.

Some areas experienced their largest snowfall levels in 18 years. Snow fell over much of Western Europe. The United Kingdom's Met Office and Ireland's Met Éireann issued severe weather warnings in anticipation of the snowfall. More than of snow fell on parts of the North Downs and over in parts of the London area. Such snow accumulation is uncommon in London. On the morning of 6 February the majority of Great Britain and Ireland had snow cover, with the area surrounding the Bristol Channel (South Wales (Cardiff area) and South West England (Bristol area)) being most affected – had settled overnight around Okehampton, Devon, South West England with similar depths in South Wales. In Ireland the highest totals were recorded around East Kildare and Wicklow County's were up to 11 inches (28 cm) fell around Naas, County Kildare and even more along the Wicklow Mountains. The last time such widespread snowfall affected Britain was in February 1991. On the 2nd a total of had fallen in Leatherhead, Surrey just south of the M25. Also had fallen over the South Downs and in higher areas of Brighton. On 2 February, all London buses were removed from service and there were severe delays on London Underground. All train services on Southeastern railway services between London, Kent and East Sussex were cancelled, as were those on Southern. South West Trains operated an emergency timetable with reduced service. Severe disruption occurred on First Capital Connect services, c2c services, First Great Western services, National Express East Anglia and Eurostar services from St Pancras International. In Ireland Dublin Bus routes were also severely disrupted while in England all bus services in Brighton, Crawley and Royal Tunbridge Wells had been severely disrupted. Heathrow Airport was closed and British Airways cancelled all departures for a period. London City, Luton, Aberdeen, Bristol, Cardiff, Birmingham and Southampton were also affected. The Gatwick Express railway service was suspended. In Ireland on 5 February Dublin Airport was closed for a period to allow snow to be cleared from the runways, delaying flights. Flights at the airport were cancelled the following day. Other effects included lost work time and disruption to education. Costs, mainly in terms of lost work time, are estimated to amount to around £1.2 billion, although this may be underestimated. The adverse weather conditions caused schools in some areas of the United Kingdom to close during 2, 3 and 5 February in the Midlands. A winter storm swept across the south of England on 9–10 February bringing heavy rain and snow, which caused flooding in southern England. In France, Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport was closed. In Aviemore, in the Scottish Highlands, a temperature of — according to the Met Office, was recorded; the lowest temperature recorded in the UK since 2003. The maximum depth of the event was in Okehampton, Devon on 6 February. Other high amounts were Drybrook, Gloucestershire which had on 2 February reported in Leatherhead, in Purley, in Croydon, in Greater London, on the South Downs, in Brighton and on higher areas of Brighton. The weather conditions severely disrupted the month's sporting schedule. Synopsis Snow falling in London, 2 February 2009 The February 2009 snowstorm followed an intense Sudden stratospheric warming in the previous month. These events often help to set up surface weather patterns that give rise to cold spells and snowfall in Europe. The snow then resulted from several factors starting on 1 February, the main component of which was a strong low pressure area near Spain. A strong high pressure area over Scandinavia created a tight pressure gradient between the two systems. A cold front also was tracking over Britain at this time. After passing through the region, cold air set in behind it, enhanced by an upper-level low over Germany. An inverted trough then extended out from the cold front, bringing precipitation to England. Late on 2 February, a surface-low pressure system, the actual snow storm, developed over the English Channel. Effects=School closures * Over 4,500 schools across the United Kingdom were closed on 3 February and the reasons given were mostly either accessibility or heating problems, although the blanket closures across whole districts demonstrate that this was not always the case. All schools in West Yorkshire, including all 197 in the City of Bradford district were closed, while Leeds City Council said it was the headteacher's decision whether a school opened. One school in Halifax, Calderdale, West Yorkshire remained closed from 2 to 6 February. Schools in Ireland were also affected. * All of Surrey's 403 schools closed on 2 and 3 February. 500 schools closed in Wales as up to of snow fell in some areas. * Most of the schools in East and West Sussex were closed on 2 and 3 February, nearly all schools in Brighton were closed on 2 and 3 February. * Every school in the boroughs of Birmingham, Dudley and Solihull in the West Midlands was shut, after a decision was taken the previous day, while more than 200 other schools in the area were closed. 110 schools were not open on 2 February and many of the decisions on keeping the schools shut for a second day were taken during the same day. * In Scotland, all 74 schools in the Borders were shut for two days. More than 250 schools were closed across the south-west, with some areas under of snow. * The majority of schools reopened on 4 February, although around 200 remained closed in Wales while other regions saw up to 100 closures. * On 5 February, over 500 schools closed due to snow in the English Midlands * In Ireland, schools across the country were shut from 2 February onwards, with the worst affected areas being County Donegal, County Carlow, County Kilkenny and County Meath. The school closures in the United Kingdom prompted negative comments from parents who were unhappy about the \\"confusing and contradictory\\" messages they received. Some laid the blame of the excessive closures: not on the public's actual ability to make alternative travel arrangements - to 'cope', but on council and school administrators' having an unhelpful risk-averse 'health and safety driven' legal attitude.Closing schools 'tells pupils it's OK to give into adversity' The Times: 4 February 2009 Page 7 - Joanna Sugden, Alexandra Frean Other concerns included parents having to take time off work when the weather was not quite as bad as it seemed. Swansea University was closed on Tuesday 3 February through concern of the safety of students and staff using icy roads. The University of Exeter was closed from 15:00 on Friday 6 February because of icy conditions on its hilly campus, while the University of the West of England in Bristol and neighbouring institutions the University of Bath and Bath Spa University were closed on Thursday 5th and Friday 6th for similar reasons. . Flooding On 9 February, heavy rain and melting snow caused flooding in southern England, exacerbated by high tides which trapped water in river systems. Heavy snow and floods closed roads in Cornwall, Devon, Oxfordshire, Somerset, Hampshire and Sussex. Areas of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire endured power cuts because of damage caused by the weight of snow on equipment or trees falling onto power lines. In Somerset, 20 people were rescued from their cars in Taunton and Yeovil because of floods, and rivers burst their banks. Transport No. 60163 Tornado hauling The Talisman from Darlington to London on 7 February. It is seen here passing through Hertfordshire Transport links in many parts of the regions were greatly affected by the bad weather. Railway services were reduced in frequency, with the south-east of England most affected, but were reintroduced over the following two days. South West Trains's services to and from Waterloo were disrupted, as were Southeastern and Southern trains services from Kent and the South Coast. By 3 February, only the District line saw route delays through London. Many rural and urban bus services in Britain and Ireland were suspended. Transport for London reported that several bus routes had been \\"suspended or redirected\\" due to blocked roads. All buses were cancelled on 2 February after 20 buses slid off the road the previous day. London did not have enough snowploughs to cope with the widespread problems. In Ireland Dublin Bus experienced delays on 3 February, particularly in the southside of the city, around Lucan, Tallaght, Rathfarnham and Enniskerry. No buses were able to gain access to Lucan village or estates in Tallaght. Dublin's M50 experienced severe delays throughout with many commuters reporting lengthy periods until they reached their homes following work. In other areas buses generally took amended routes, avoiding side roads or rural lanes and using only main roads. In England and Wales both Severn crossings were closed on 6 February because ice began falling from overhead gantries, affecting both the M4 and M48 motorways across the Severn Estuary; traffic was diverted into Gloucestershire and onto the M50. This was the first closure because of a weather-related incident of the second Severn crossing since the structure opened in 1996.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7873359.stm Ice-fall on cars shuts M4 bridges They reopened on 10 February. The A23 between Brighton and Haywards Heath saw severe disruption on 2 February and the A27 through Brighton was closed because of the huge volume of snowfall. Air traffic delays Heathrow Airport closed both of its runways; one was later reopened. British Airways cancelled all departures. London City, Luton and Southampton Airports were closed. The Gatwick Express railway service was suspended. Temporary closures also affected other international airports at Cardiff, Birmingham and Bristol. On 5 February heavy snowfalls closed Dublin Airport in Ireland, leading to the cancellation of approximately half the flight operation or almost 200 flights. The airport closed at 01:00, blaming slippery runways, and flights were diverted to other airports. It reopened at 19:45 that evening but flights were disrupted by the weather again the following day. Casualties The icy conditions led to many casualties on roads and exposed areas. Hospitals across the region reported great increases in injuries sustained from falling in the snow as large numbers of people came outside to partake in the winter weather. Sites across south-central England, covering Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, reported that their emergency departments were very busy with minor injuries, with figures of more than one-quarter of all patients suffering falls. * Two military helicopters were called in to assist ambulance crews in Devon and Cornwall, some parts of which were under of snow and claimed to be cut off. North Devon District Hospital and several hospitals in the region cancelled all outpatient appointments, while others in the area restricted their services to emergencies only. * In Kelty in Fife, Scotland, two ambulance crew members were injured when the vehicle overturned on the A909 en route to an emergency call on 2 February. * Five girls were involved in an accident while sledging on a makeshift sledge, reported by BBC News Online to have been the roof of an old Land Rover, at Rother Valley Country Park in South Yorkshire. One was airlifted to Sheffield Northern General Hospital, where she was pronounced dead, while the others went by ambulance, having sustained non-critical injuries. * Three men were injured while sledging at Devil's Dyke in West Sussex and were rescued by a 4 x 4 support vehicle. * In the West Midlands of England, two men were airlifted to hospital after injuring themselves in separate accidents, one at Baggeridge Country Park in Sedgley. * On 2 February, four road accidents were reported on one stretch in County Sligo, Ireland. * Amidst heavy snowfalls on the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland, four motorists became stranded in two 4X4 vehicles in the Sally Gap on 3–4 February. Mountain rescuers on skis had brought them food and blankets until they could be airlifted to Blessington. * Around 200 motorists had to be rescued in Devon on 6 February, after their vehicles became stranded in heavy snow. * A mother gave birth to twins in Devon after firefighters were mobilised to her aid when ambulances and rescue helicopters were hindered by the snow. Deaths * A man died of hypothermia in Aberdeen where the temperature dropped to .http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1072377 * A man was killed in a car crash at Sandy Bridge in Llanelli, Wales on 2 February. * A 16-year-old girl died whilst sledging down a hill on a car bonnet near Rotherham, South Yorkshire. * A 6-year-old boy died after falling through an iced-over pond at Streethouse, West Yorkshire on 7 February. He was airlifted to Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, but later died. News coverage News coverage of the snow received very high ratings, with over 7 million watching the BBC's 18:00 and 22:00 news programmes. The BBC News channel received its biggest audience since the 2007 London car bombs, and their website was sent 35,000 pictures and videos from people of the snow, their highest number ever. Sporting changes and disruptions The region's sporting schedule for the early and latter parts of the week was severely affected by the extreme weather conditions. Sports such as hurling, camogie, gaelic football, association football, rugby union, rugby league, horse racing, motorsports and fox hunting were all disrupted in various ways summarised below. * The English FA Cup fourth-round replay between Arsenal and Cardiff City in North London was postponed, as were Football League Championship matches involving London sides Queens Park Rangers and Crystal Palace. * Sixteen out of twenty-four matches in Football League's One and Two were cancelled on 3 February, as was an FA Trophy match. * The winter football transfer window for Premier League clubs in Scotland and England, which had already been extended due to 31 January falling on a Saturday rather than a midweek day, was provisionally altered so that clubs could complete transfers. Clubs had to provide evidence that a transfer could not be completed before the 17:00 deadline because of the weather. Leeds United had to miss out on the signing of Liam Dickinson because the transfer papers came at 17:14, 14 minutes after the deadline because of the weather. * Horse-racing events scheduled for 3 February were cancelled at Market Rasen, Sedgefield and Southwell and the meeting at Ludlow (scheduled for 4 February) was cancelled the same day. * In rugby union the England Saxons vs Ireland A match was cancelled. * In rugby league, Halifax vs Blackpool Panthers, London Skolars vs Dewsbury Rams and Oldham R.L.F.C. vs Rochdale Hornets had to rearrange their Northern Rail Cup fixtures. Of the three Super League games due to take place during the weekend of 6–8 February, Leeds Rhinos vs Crusaders and Wigan Warriors vs Wakefield Trinity Wildcats went ahead, but Harlequins RL vs Bradford Bulls had to be postponed due to a frozen pitch. * The France national rugby union team were stranded at Dublin Airport on 5 February as they arrived in Ireland ahead of their Six Nations Championship match in Croke Park the following day. * The football fixtures were disrupted again on 7–8 February. Games in the Football League Championship between Barnsley - Crystal Palace, Charlton Athletic - Cardiff City and Watford - Southampton were all called off. Only three matches were played in Football League One after eight were postponed and it was a similar story in Football League Two with just five matches going ahead, while in the Conference National, only two matches were played. Several matches were called off in Scotland, at Airdrie, Aberdeen (both Scottish Cup), Elgin (Division Three) and Peterhead (Division Two). * On 8 February Gaelic football and hurling fixtures in Ireland's Allianz National League were disrupted by that day's fall of snow. Eleven games were postponed in the Allianz NHL: Galway v Kilkenny, Offaly v Carlow, Laois v Down, Meath v Kildare, Wicklow v Armagh, Donegal v Longford, Tyrone v Fingal, Sligo v Monaghan, Laois v Down, Cavan v Fermanagh and Roscommon v London. One match in the Allianz NFL was postponed for the same reason, Leitrim v Carlow. * All camogie fixtures were cancelled and in the Leinster Under-21 Football Championship 3 games were cancelled: Wicklow v Longford, Wexford v Kildare and Louth v Dublin. * In motorsports, the Irish Championship Rallycross at Mondello Park was cancelled. * A point-to point meeting in Gorey, County Wexford in Ireland was cancelled. * The Island Hunt Foxhounds was cancelled on 8 February. Reaction In some regions of Britain, the response to the adverse weather conditions was considered an unnecessary panic - the Devon and Cornwall Business Council stated: \\"We have had too many businesses closed unnecessarily because people were panicked by the weather forecast. (...) We have had too many schools closed down, which has an adverse impact on people who rely on carers to look after children. (...) I think we have over-reacted quite significantly.\\" It has been estimated that the weather cost the region's small businesses £40m. Aftermath In the wake of London's bus service closures, an inquiry was held into the inability of London's local authorities to work with public transport service providers.

The Maiden of Finland (, ) is the national personification of Finland.  Personification  She is a barefoot young woman in her mid-twenties with often braided blonde hair, blue eyes, wearing a blue and white national costume or a white dress. She was originally called Aura after the Aura River in Turku. As a symbol, the Finnish Maiden has been used since the 19th century when she was pictured as a woman wearing a turreted crown, and then developing as Finland gained a national consciousness and independence. She was depicted in poetry and fine arts. Zachris Topelius and Walter Runeberg were important in establishing Finnish Maiden as a symbol. Like the Mother Svea of neighbouring Sweden, the Finnish maiden was first an adult woman but gradually became younger. In the painting Attack by Edvard Isto, the Finnish Maiden is being attacked by the Russian eagle, which is tearing away the law book from her hands. It was painted when the Russification of Finland started in 1899.  Mapping issues  The areas ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union after the Continuation War. The Maiden of Finland can also refer to the shape of Finland on the map. With a little imagination it looks like a female form which has one hand raised (and another before the Moscow Armistice of 1944), a head, and a skirt.

He is the author of C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea (2003) and numerous academic papers in journals such as Christian Scholars' Review, International Journal for the Philosophy of Religion, Philo, and Philosophia Christi. He is also a philosophy blogger, with two blogs.Dangerous Idea and Dangerous Idea 2 He holds a Ph.D. in philosophy (1989) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The argument from reason Reppert first became interested in the argument from reason after a conversion experience at the age of 18. He became aware that while unbelievers like Bertrand Russell claimed to be more rational than believers, Christians like C. S. Lewis claimed not only that their belief is more rational than unbelief, but that the argument from reason shows that the very capacity to reason is itself a reason to think that the naturalism espoused by unbelievers is false. When he read G. E. M. Anscombe's critique of Lewis's argument, Reppert became persuaded that the argument could be formulated in such a way as to overcome Anscombe's objections. His paper \\"The Lewis-Anscombe Controversy: A Discussion of the Issues\\"Victor Reppert. \\"The Lewis-Anscombe Controversy: A Discussion of the Issues\\", Christian Scholars' Review 19, no 1 (September 1989): 32-48. was the result.QCI Interview: Dr. Victor Reppert on the \\"Argument from Reason\\" In 1998, Reppert posted his paper \\"The Argument from Reason\\"Victor Reppert. \\"The Argument from Reason (1998)\\" to the Secular Web. In 1999 a slightly revised version of the same paperVictor Reppert. \\"The Argument from Reason\\", Philo, 2, no. 1 (Spring-Summer 1999). appeared, with a response by Jim Lippard,Jim Lippard. \\"Historical but Indistinguishable: Some Notes on Victor Reppert's Paper\\", Philo 2, no. 1 (Spring-Summer 1999): 45-47. in the humanist journal Philo. In the same issue, Keith M. Parsons, the then editor of Philo, presented some arguments against Reppert's conclusions in the course of a review of Thomas Nagel's The Last Word, so in 2000 Reppert wrote a \\"Reply to Parsons and Lippard\\",Victor Reppert. \\"Reply to Parsons and Lippard on the Argument from Reason\\", Philo, 3, no. 1 (Spring-Summer 2000): 76-89. to which Parsons responded by writing the first full-dress attempt to refute Reppert's argument.Keith M. Parsons. \\"Further Reflections on the Argument from Reason\\", Philo, 3, no. 1 (Spring- Summer 2000): 90-102. Reppert's reply to Parsons was the paper \\"Causal Closure, Mechanism, and Rational Inference\\",Victor Reppert. \\"Causal Closure, Mechanism, and Rational Inference: A Response to Keith Parsons\\", Philosophia Christi, 2nd series, 3, no. 2 (2001): 473-484. which, since he felt it was time that more Christian philosophers were familiarized with the argument and related issues, appeared in 2001 in Philosophia Christi. In 2003 Philosophia Christi featured a \\"Symposium on the Argument from Reason\\", consisting of a paper by Reppert,Victor Reppert. \\"Several Formulations of the Argument from Reason\\", Philosophia Christi, 2nd series, 5, no. 1 (2003): 9-34. responses by Theodore M.

Also in 2003, Reppert published his book C. S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea. The title alludes to Daniel Dennett's Darwin's Dangerous Idea, in which Dennett contrasted two types of explanation: one type is \\"mind-first\\" (that is to say, \\"in the last analysis ... purposeful and intentional\\"), whereas the other type \\"makes the explanation a feature of the system that in the last analysis is a product of the mindless system of physics and chemistry.\\" For Dennett, Reppert observes, Darwin's dangerous idea is that the latter \\"are the only acceptable types of explanation\\", a position that \\"has become orthodoxy in such varied disciplines as evolutionary biology, cognitive science and artificial intelligence\\", as well as \\"in Anglo-American philosophy in general\\". C. S. Lewis's dangerous idea, by contrast, is that the attempt entirely to account for the world in such terms \\"overlooks something very important: the world thus analyzed has to have scientists in it. And scientists draw their conclusions from evidence, and in so doing they engage in rational inference.... Lewis's contention was that ... if you tried to account for the activity of reasoning as a byproduct of a fundamentally nonpurposive system, you end up describing something that cannot genuinely be called reasoning.\\"Victor Reppert. C. S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea, Downers Green, Illinois: InterVarsity Press, 2003: 8-9. In Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Dennett calls Darwin's idea \\"wonderful\\", \\"magnificent\\", and \\"the single best idea anyone has ever had\\", and says that his (Dennett's) admiration for it is \\"unbounded\\".Daniel Dennett. Darwin's Dangerous Idea, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995: 21. Reppert observes that \\"If Darwin's dangerous idea is a true explanation of how Darwin got his dangerous idea, then the idea cannot possibly be the intellectual monument that Dennett supposes it to be.\\" C. S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea attracted a lot of response, including some comments by critics, most notably Richard C. Carrier, who on Internet Infidels called the book \\"surely the most extensive defense of the so-called 'Argument from Reason' yet to appear in print.\\"Richard C. Carrier. \\"Critical Review of Victor Reppert's Defense of the Argument from Reason (2004)\\" Carrier's review \\"is about as long as the book itself\\", Reppert noted only half-jokingly, before going on to respond to some of Carrier's criticisms.Victor Reppert. \\"Defending the Dangerous Idea: An Update on Lewis's Argument from Reason\\", in David Baggett, Gary R. Habermas and Gerry L. Walls (eds), C. S. Lewis as Philosopher: Truth, Goodness and Beauty, Downers Green, Illinois: IVP Academic, 2008: 53-67. Another response to Carrier's review came from Darek Barefoot, who, while he did not \\"find all of Reppert's arguments to be persuasive and all of Carrier's criticisms to be off-target\\", believed that the core of the argument from reason \\"is sound and that Reppert's book is a landmark contribution to the subject.\\"Darek Barefoot. \\"A Response to Richard Carrier's Review of C. S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea (2007)\\" Barefoot argued that Reppert had made a strong case for Lewis's claim \\"that the process of inference by which consideration of premises causes us to adopt a conclusion cannot be coherently conceived of in terms of physical cause-and-effect alone.\\" Furthermore, if Reppert's version of the Argument from Reason \\"is successful, it reveals that rationality is fundamental to the universe, not simply a by-product of physical cause-and-effect; and this, in turn, is readily explicable on theism, but problematic for naturalism.\\"Darek Barefoot: Abstract Jim Lippard, reporting a lecture by Daniel Dennett at Arizona State University in 2009, recounted that Dennett had coined the disparaging term \\"mind-creationists\\" for those who argue that original intentionality is an irreducible feature of the world. Lippard noted that the \\"mind-creationists\\" whom Dennett had in his sights included atheists like Thomas Nagel, John Searle and Jerry Fodor as well as believers like Victor Reppert.Jim Lippard. \\"Daniel Dennett at ASU\\" The Anscombe myth In addition to explaining and expanding Lewis's theistic argument for God, Reppert has also made an important contribution to Lewis studies by deconstructing what he calls the \\"Anscombe myth\\". Roughly, the \\"Anscombe myth\\" arose, in part, from an actual encounter C. S. Lewis had at his Socratic Club with Catholic philosopher G. E. M. Anscombe over the soundness of the theistic argument he presents in his book Miracles. It has been alleged that Elizabeth Anscombe, in her presentation of the perceived problematic areas in Lewis's argument, had so thoroughly discredited his argument that Lewis sank into apologetic and theological obscurity.John M. Dolan. \\"G. E. M. Anscombe: Living the Truth\\". First Things, 113 (May 2001): 11-13. It has also been suggested that this friendly encounter led Lewis to not only reject the Argument from Reason, but also significantly question the validity of Christianity altogether. Reppert, in his critique of the \\"Anscombe myth\\", points out that Lewis merely revised his argument for later editions of Miracles, rather than rejecting it. Furthermore, Reppert notes that Lewis continued to proactively maintain the argument, as evidenced by the publication of several post-Anscombe-debate articles, chiefly in Christian Reflections and God in the Dock. Reppert also points out that Lewis's spiritual tenor in his later writings doesn't significantly differ in tone or substance from his earlier Christian material. Other work Reppert has also done work criticising Hume, and, in particular the Humean theories of miracles.https://infidels.org/library/modern/victor_reppert/miracles.html Selected bibliography *C.

Ancestors Parker was the younger son of the English theologian and clergyman Samuel Parker (1640–1688), who served as Bishop of Oxford and President of Magdalen College during the tumultuous reign of James II. Early years After early schooling in Kent, Parker attended Trinity College, Oxford, but left after several years, c. 1700, without taking a degree, evidently because he was unwilling to take the oath of allegiance, which was required of all who stood for degrees.  Political and Religious Views Parker joined in the nonjuring schism and worshiped separately until 1711. He was, however, persuaded by his friend Henry Dodwell's argument, in The Case in View, that the schism would end with the death of the last invalidly deprived bishop who continued to insist on his right, and he therefore returned to his parish church—St Peter in the East, Oxford—after the death of William Lloyd (bishop of Norwich). However, Parker persisted in his Jacobitism. Although he attended services at St. Peter in the East, he thought the prayers for the ruling monarch sinful, and signalized his objections to these prayers by standing up or making various gestures when they were recited. Parker refused to take orders in the Church of England or accept any position that would have required him to take the oaths of allegiance and abjuration, and he taught his sons his nonjuring and Jacobite principles.  Employment  As a nonjuror, Parker could not take any position in the government, the church, or the university. To make a living, he ran a boarding house for foreign scholars visiting Oxford. He also ran an academy where sons of Jacobite squires and nonjuring clerics were educated. Students who attended it included the nonjurors Thomas Deacon and Thomas Wagstaffe the Younger. There are many references to Parker, his academy, and his boarding house in Thomas Hearne's diaries. Publications Parker was an accomplished writer and translator. He published a verse translation of Homer's battle of the frogs and the mice (Homer in a Nutshell, 1699) and two translations of Cicero (Tully's Five Books De Finibus, 1702; Cicero's Cato Major, etc, 1704). He also translated several of the orations of Athanasius and produced an abridged translation of Eusebius, which was eventually bundled with other translations and abridgments of early church fathers. He was responsible from 1708 to 1710 for a monthly periodical entitled Censura temporum, or Good and Ill Tendencies of Books,. This was a book review in dialogue form which upheld orthodoxy and the Church of England against the anti-trinitarian religious ideas of William Whiston and the political notions of John Locke. He also published Moral Essays on Some of the Most Curious and Significant English, Scotch, and Foreign Proverbs in 1710, which contains one of the first instances of the proverb \\"tis better to give than to receive.\\"Manser, Martin H (2007). The Facts on File Dictionary of Proverbs, p. 149. Checkmark Books, New York. . Parker published two volumes of essays:Six Philosophical Essays (1700) and Sylva (1701). These include early critiques of the religious and political ideas of John Locke. Among other things, Parker argues for the immateriality and hence immortality of the soul. Parker's chef d'ouvre was Bibliotheca Biblica (collected in 5 vols., 1720–1735), a massive compilation of patristic commentary on the Bible, issued in monthly installments beginning in 1717 and funded via subscription. Parker hoped to cover all of the books of the Bible. However, at the time of his death only the first five volumes, covering the Pentateuch, had been completed. The fifth and final volume was published posthumously, in 1735, with a life of Parker appended. Family and Descendants Parker married Mary Clements, daughter of the Oxford bookseller Henry Clements. He had at least five sons, as well as several daughters. His eldest son, Samuel, after serving an apprenticeship in London, became a yeoman bedel at Oxford. His second son, Sackville, was a well-known Oxford bookseller who kept a shop in the High Street at the corner of Logic Lane and was a friend of Samuel Johnson. His third son, Richard, attended Lincoln College, Oxford, on a scholarship, but left without a degree on account of the oaths and later helped his father prepare the Bibliotheca Biblica. Other descendants founded the well-known Parker's bookselling establishment in the Turl, Oxford.

The cable consists of four fibre pairs and is 14,530 km in length, linking from Yzerfontein in the Western Cape of South Africa to London in the United Kingdom. It has 14 landing points, 12 along the western coast of Africa (including Cape Verde and Canary Islands) and 2 in Europe (Portugal and England) completed on land by a cable termination station in London. The total cost for the cable system is $650 million. WACS was originally known as the Africa West Coast Cable (AWCC) and was planned to branch to South America but this was dropped and the system eventually became the West African Cable System.\\"Same Day Analysis: WASACE Plans Submarine Cable Connecting Africa to Europe, Latin America and North America\\" Global Insight, 28 November 2011 Landing points The cable has landed in the following countries and locations: #South Africa, Western Cape, Yzerfontein #Namibia, Swakopmund #Angola, Sangano near Luanda #Democratic Republic of Congo, Muanda #Republic of Congo, Matombi near Pointe Noire #Cameroon, Limbe, near Douala #Nigeria, Lekki, near Lagos #Togo, Afidenyigba near Lomé #Ghana, Nungua near Accra #Ivory Coast, Abidjan #Cape Verde, Palmarejo near Praia #Canary Islands, Telde(el Goro) near Las Palmas #Portugal, Sesimbra near Seixal #United Kingdom, Brean near Highbridge (fiber link is extended by underground cable to London) The landings in Namibia, the DRC, the Republic of Congo and Togo will provide the first direct connections for these countries to the global submarine cable network. While all earlier submarine cables were terminated at South Africa's international submarine gateways in Melkbosstrand or Mtunzini the WACS cable has been landed at Yzerfontein in order to reduce risk of complete isolation from the rest of the world in the case of damages by earthquakes or a large ship dragging its anchor. Design capacity The planned design capacity of WACS was 3.84 Tbit/s when the project agreement was signed in 2008. When delivered in 2012 the initial design capacity was 5.12Tbit/s. An upgrade delivered by Huawei Marine in December 2015 using WDM Soft Decision FEC and bit interleaved coded modulation advanced decoders permitting the design capacity to be increased to 14.5Tbit/s. Innovations Instead of powering the 236 undersea optical amplifiers and the 12 Submarine branching units along the cable by a single conductor which would require the voltage to be well over 12,000 to 14,000 V in the order of some 24,000 V DC, the system is supplied by two independent rings from Europe to West Africa and West Africa to South Africa, thus reducing the power requirements to around 12,000 V DC. Branching units are designed to keep the main trunk intact in case of failure. Repairing a branch will not affect the traffic on the main cable. Landing stations support wavelength pass through which means a wavelength coming into a landing station does not just stop there but carries on. This feature allows future upgrade to be carried out without the necessity to have to upgrade each landing point. Topology One of the four fibre pairs is a direct route from South Africa to Europe, a so-called express lane. The second and third fibre pairs are designed as a semi-express lane, one with two hops, from South Africa to West Africa and West Africa to Europe and the other with three stops. The fourth fibre pair is an omnibus fibre that stops off at all landing ports en route. *Fibre Pair one known as the Express lane (South Africa and Portugal) *Fibre Pair two (South Africa to Nigeria to Portugal) *Fibre Pair three (South Africa to Angola to DRC to Ivory Coast to Portugal) *Fibre Pair four (All WACS Landing Stations) Construction and ownership The following South African companies were announced as participants in the construction and maintenance of the cable system.http://www.itweb.co.za/sections/telecoms/2009/0903111044.asp? MTN Group has invested $90 million in the cable making it the largest investor, and in return will receive 11% of the initial capacity of the cable. *MTN Group: a South African-based regional mobile operator *Neotel: South Africa's second fixed line operator - Liquid Telecom bought Neotel in 2018/19 *Telkom South Africa: South Africa's incumbent fixed line operator *Vodacom: a South African-based regional mobile operator *Gateway Communications: a pan-African wholesale connectivity and telecommunications provider *Broadband Infraco: a South African state-owned telecom infrastructure company On 8 April 2009, the following companies signed the WACS Construction and Maintenance Agreement and formed the final consortium: The WACS consortium includes 12 companies: #Vodacom #Togo Telecom #Telkom (South Africa) #Telecom Namibia #Tata Communications/Neotel #Portugal Telecom/Cabo Verde Telecom #Office Congolais des Postes et Telecommunications #MTN Group #Congo telecom #Cable & Wireless Worldwide #Broadband Infraco #Angola Cables The supply contract was signed the same day between the consortium members and Alcatel-Lucent Submarine Networks.

Early life De Lisi was born in New York and grew up in Long Island. He moved in with his grandmother when studied sculpture at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. He became interested in fashion when his grandmother taught him how to sew and recreate a pair of trousers he could not afford to buy. Career De Lisi started designing his own menswear range in 1979, and he moved to London in the fashion industry in 1982. He started working with Debenhams in 1992.

Ronald Reagan, the 33rd Governor of California (served 1967–1975), announced his candidacy for President of the United States in New York City on November 13, 1979. On July 17, 1980, he became the nominee of the Republican Party for the 1980 presidential election. After receiving the Republican nomination, he selected one of his opponents in the primary elections, George H. W. Bush, to be his running mate. On November 4, 1980, Reagan carried 44 of 50 states and received 489 electoral votes to win the election. Jimmy Carter, the incumbent president, carried six states, as well as Washington, D.C., and received 49 electoral votes. Reagan won 50.7 percent of the popular vote, Carter took 41 percent, and Independent John B. Anderson (a liberal Republican) received 6.7 percent. Reagan's election as President was completed with the meeting of the Electoral College on December 15, 1980, and with the subsequent certification of the college's vote by the Joint session of Congress on January 6, 1981. Chronicle=Primaries Reagan announced his candidacy for President of the United States in New York City on November 13, 1979. End of the primaries On May 20, 1980, after the Michigan and Oregon primaries, Ronald Reagan secured enough delegates to clinch the nomination for the Republican Party. His opponent in the general election, incumbent President Jimmy Carter, passed the delegate threshold to become the presumptive nominee of his party on June 3. On May 26, George H. W. Bush, Reagan's remaining opponent for the Republican nomination, conceded defeat and urged his supporters to back Reagan. Vice Presidential selection On July 16 (day 3 of the Republican National Convention) Gerald Ford consults with Bob Dole, Howard Baker and Bill Brock before ultimately making a decision to decline the offer to serve as Reagan's running mate Ronald Reagan's choice for vice presidential running mate had been a subject of speculation since the end of the primaries. When former President Gerald Ford revealed in a CBS interview with Walter Cronkite that he was seriously considering the vice presidency, Ford garnered a great deal of interest. However, after Ford suggested the possibility of a \\"co-presidency\\" and, in addition, insisted that Henry Kissinger be re-appointed as Secretary of State and that Alan Greenspan be appointed as Secretary of the Treasury, negotiations to form a Reagan-Ford ticket ceased. Less than twenty-four hours before Reagan had formally accepted the Republican nomination, he telephoned George H. W. Bush to inform Bush of his intent to nominate him. The following day, on July 17—the final day of the Republican National Convention—Reagan officially announced Bush as his running mate. Republican National Convention Reagan giving his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. The 1980 Republican National Convention convened at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan. Reagan accepted the Republican nomination on the final day of the convention: > \\"With a deep awareness of the responsibility conferred by your trust, I > accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States. I do so with > deep gratitude, and I think also I might interject on behalf of all of us, > our thanks to Detroit and the people of Michigan and to this city for the > warm hospitality they have shown. And I thank you for your wholehearted > response to my recommendation in regard to George Bush as a candidate for > vice president.\\" Opinion polling Weeks before the election, Reagan trailed Carter in most polls. In the Gallup poll on October 26, Jimmy Carter was at 47 percent and Ronald Reagan at 39 percent. Following his sole debate with President Carter on October 28, Reagan overcame the largest deficit since Gallup polling began in 1936, and within one week, the Associated Press reported that the race was \\"too close to call\\". Three weeks before the election, Yankelovich, Skelly and White produced a survey of 1,632 registered voters showing the race almost dead even, as did a private survey by Caddell. Two weeks later, a survey by CBS News and the New York Times showed a similar situation. Although some pollsters reported a slight Reagan lead, ABC News-Harris surveys consistently gave Reagan a lead of a few points until the climactic last week of October. Political positions Ronald and Nancy Reagan campaigning with Strom Thurmond in Columbia, South Carolina. The United States in the 1970s underwent \\"stagflation\\"—a wrenching period of low economic growth, high inflation and high interest rates and intermittent energy crises. Reagan was an adherent of supply-side economics, which argues that economic growth can be most effectively created using incentives for people to produce (supply) goods and services, such as adjusting income tax and capital gains tax rates. Accordingly, Reagan promised an economic revival that would affect all sectors of the population. Reagan theorized that cutting tax rates would actually increase tax revenues because the lower rates would cause people to work harder as they would be able to keep more of their money. Reagan called for a drastic cut in \\"big government\\" and pledged to deliver a balanced budget for the first time since 1969. In the primaries, Bush famously called Reagan's economic policy \\"voodoo economics\\" because it promised to lower taxes and increase revenues at the same time. Interest rate crisis of 1980. Controversy Since the 1980 election, the 1980 campaign has been used as an example of dog whistle rhetoric by some. During the campaign, Reagan used the term \\"state's rights\\", and also referred to \\"Cadillac-driving 'welfare queens'\\" and \\"'strapping young bucks' buying T-bone steaks with food stamps\\". These actions are also seen by some as an extension of a \\"Southern Strategy\\" developed by President Richard Nixon to garner white support for Republican candidates.Haney-Lopez, Ian. \\"The Racism at The Heart of the Reagan Presidency: How Ronald Reagan Used Coded Racial Appeals to Galvanize White Voters and Gut the Middle Class\\" Salon 1 Nov. 2014.

David Brooks noted the fact that Reagan had been courting black voters at the same time he was supposedly using this code language.

Its ruins lie on the outskirts of Helsingør, close to the town of Tikøb on lake Gurre Sø at Gurre. The ruins have been excavated and are now restored. History The castle was built in the 12th century. Four towers and a perimeter wall were added in the 1350s. It was first mentioned in court chronicles in 1364, when Pope Urban V sent a gift of relics to its chapel. King Valdemar Atterdag died in the castle in 1375. Many stories, ballads, and poems have been made about Valdemar. The castle is associated with a legend about King Valdemar, his love for his beautiful mistress Tove Lille who according to tradition stayed for a long time at Gurre Castle and the resulting jealousy of his Queen Helvig of Schleswig. Over the centuries, this core saga was enriched by other legends, eventually growing into a national myth of Denmark. The myth was put into poetical form by the Danish novelist and poet Jens Peter Jacobsen (1847-1885). A German translation of his poems forms the text of the cantata Gurre-Lieder by Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951). Excavations A partial excavation of the ruin took place in 1817. In 1835, a major excavation of the ruins took place, during which the remains were surveyed and mapped. Additional research took place in the 1890s. In 1921, the remains of a stone building were exposed. In the years 1936-39, a restoration of the ruin was carried out.

Kirkleski played college football for Lafayette College, in which he graduated from in 1927. College While at Lafayette, Kirkleski was known as a hard-hitting back. He played all four of his college years as a varsity halfback. During his freshman season, he shocked Lafayette's archrival, Lehigh University, with a touchdown run that gave the Leopards a 13–3 last-minute victory in 1923. Lehigh only scored three points in Kirkleski's four years at Lafayette. In his sophomore year, he helped guide Lafayette to a 7–2 record. He was named the team's captain during his senior year. It was then that he helped the Leopards capture their third national championship with a 9–0 record.

The film is a mockbuster created to capitalize on the release of Cloverfield. It was released direct-to-DVD on January 15, 2008. Cloverfield was released theatrically three days later on January 18, 2008.  Plot  The film takes place in Tokyo in 2003, where two reporters, Erin and Sarah Lynch, have arrived to document unusual seismic disturbances that have been picked up around Tokyo. The disturbances are originally thought to be aftershocks left over from a supposed massive earthquake on the Kanto Fault that occurred two years previously, causing hundreds of thousands of casualties and several hundred billion dollars in damage (possibly referencing the real-life Fukuoka earthquake or the Miyagi earthquake), although careful analysis of the evidence suggests otherwise. As time goes on, all of Tokyo begins to suffer from abnormal earth tremors similar to those registered in 2005. The tremors are found not to be caused by an earthquake, but by a gigantic octopus that has been dormant for centuries. It has since been awakened by mankind and now sees Tokyo as a new feeding-ground; the filmmakers document the catastrophe as it unfolds. It starts as Erin and Sarah are talking about filming Tokyo. The scene then switches to the interior of Erin's car as the two drive to LAX, to catch their flight to Tokyo. In Tokyo they rent a hotel room, and, the next day, Sarah films Erin talking with the global warming minister. During the interview, an earthquake strikes and the scene again switches to the reporters in the basement of the environmental building. They find a survivor named Justin Robbins, and as they flee, they hear the sounds of panic and plane engines from a tunnel. Later, they find a mall, and another earthquake occurs. In the chaos, Justin is impaled by a pole as the reporters flee in panic. Some small text appears on the screen saying that tape #3 was damaged. As the reporters run toward a mall they find a woman (Aiko) and her grandfather, and they eat and sleep, Erin not realizing she had left the camera turned on. Then, another earthquake begins and kills the grandfather as the woman tells the reporters to flee. They hear the mall explode as they run away and soon find a building which they enter. They have gone upstairs when the building suddenly collapses. The reporters survive, but the collapse damages the camera lens. Night arrives and they see helicopters ready to save refugees, but a tentacle destroys them and proceeds to throw cars at the people, killing many of them. Panic ensues, and Sarah abandons Erin. A tentacle slams into the ground where Erin is and she is wounded. Additionally, the camera's batteries run low. Sarah cries for Erin as the crash of a tentacle hitting the ground is heard, ending the film, which indicates that the reporters were crushed by the monster and were among the thousands, if not millions, killed.  Reception  The few reviews of the film posted online have been extremely negative. Scott Foy of Dread Central did an audio file parody of the \\"found footage\\" concept used by the movie: in this case, the file consists of Foy giving his thoughts on the movie while at the same time pretending to be slowly going insane due to the movie's abysmal quality; it culminates in him apparently jumping out of a window. Foy would later state that some people actually thought his \\"insanity\\" was real and would also name Monster the \\"Worst Direct To DVD Horror Movie of 2008\\" in a later podcast. Other reviews referred to the Film as being 'terrible,' its pacing as 'horrendous' and the overall film to be 'astoundingly dull.'

The feud was named after the knightly House of Dernbach, a powerful Ganerbschaft (jointly-owned inheritance) with almost sovereign rights. The Dernbachers, along with the Lords of Bicken (the present-day administrative center of Mittenaar), carried the primary burden of opposing Nassau’s quest for the territorial dominion of the area. Beginning of the feud In the middle of the 12th century, the emerging House of Nassau greatly expanded its possessions. In 1231, it received the sovereignty over the Herborner Mark as a sub-fief from the Landgrave of Thuringia, who had been awarded it by Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. As early as 1230, violent incidents between the local nobility and Nassau were reported. By the death of Count Henry (Heinrich) II, the Rich in 1251, the feud was already in full swing. The cause of the feud was the ambition of Nassau to curtail or take away the rights (including mining, hunting, and customs rights) and possessions (forests and ore mines in the Schelderwald) of the local aristocracy. The Landgraves of Thuringia and later of Hesse supported the local nobility. The leading figures of the lower nobility against Nassau were the Lords of Dernbach. Parallel with this conflict, Count Henry II was also fighting a vendetta against the Knight of Wilnsdorf in the Siegerland, who soon allied himself with the Dernbachers. Not much is known about the fighting itself, but presumably it followed the usual pattern of feuds: essentially the looting and devastation of enemy possessions. At the beginning of the feud, according to tradition, Nassau destroyed a castle of the Dernbachers near Herborn, in the territory of the present-day borough of Seelbach, and the small Hessian castle of Lixfeld. However, historians cannot substantiate this allegation. In connection with the feud, Nassau constructed their first castle near Dillenburg and the Herborn Castle. When the Countship of Nassau was divided in 1255 under Henry II’s sons Walram II and Otto I, the Dernbacher Feud had its first mention in the corresponding document. There are reports that sporadic fighting continued during the reign of Henry I of Nassau-Siegen (1270–1343). It must have been during this time that the Dernbachers received support from neighboring Lords of Bicken, who came to Hainchen. By around 1250 the Landgraves of Hesse, who in regard to the Herborner Mark were the feudal lords of the Counts of Nassau, had also become involved in the feud. This was possibly in connection with the War of the Thuringian Succession. Landgrave Henry I built a castle at Eisemroth (the present-day administrative center of Siegbach) in 1307-1308 for protection against Nassau. On 9 November 1309, the Dernbachers sold their home castle, the small water castle Alt-Dernbach, to the new Landgrave Otto I and received it back as a fiefdom. This was presumably because its finances were heavily affected by the feud. Otto undertook to further expand the castle, to bring the city under its protection to prevent it from falling into the hands of Nassau. Apparently, this allowed the Dernbachs to strongly assert themselves against Nassau again. On June 26, 1312, Landgrave Otto I concluded an agreement with several members of the House of Nassau. It committed both sides in the future to no longer build castles against each other, and the Nassaus conceded that they could not restrict the rights are the Lords of Dernbach and Wilnsdorf. Afterwards the feud seems to have cooled somewhat, because by 1325 Nassau had bought some of the possessions of the Dernbachers, Bickeners, and the Bickeners of Hainchen, which brought them a stable power base, particularly in the court of Ebersbach (present-day Ewersbach in Dietzhölztal). In 1325, the feud erupted anew with great hardship. In this time, among other things, the wooden castle of Nassau at Dillenburg was burnt down. Presumably in the same year Henry I of Nassau- Siegen destroyed the Castle (Alt-) Dernbach, the headquarters of the Dernbachers. The Castle Wallenfels, built by the Landgrave in 1320, was apparently surrendered in battle and came securely into Nassau’s possession (though later it had to be held “open” to the Landgrave). The Landgrave thus lost important bases in the disputed territory and so in 1326 built the new Hessenwald Castle, near the present site of Roth at the Heligenberg, strategically advantageously located on the remaining possessions of the Lords of Bicken, and likewise protecting the Breidenbacher area. One of the major battles, lost by Hesse, took place in 1327 in Seibertshausen (a village on the Gladenbach Uplands, later abandoned and eventually incorporated into Weidenhausen, now part of Gladenbach). However, Landgrave Henry II of Hesse later won the battle on 10 August 1328 at Wetzlar, in which Count John of Nassau-Dillenburg (a son of Otto I) was killed. End of the Feud With the loss of Dernbach Castle, the feud was lost for the knightly house based there. On 21 May 1333 it concluded a contract with Henry I of Nassau-Siegen, in which it sold all of rights in the Herborn and the Herborner Mark and many other rights in smaller settlements. The Dernbachers retained only the religious patronage rights and 13 courts in smaller villages. In 1334 Henry III of Nassau-Dillenburg was finally given Wallenfels Castle by Landgrave Henry II. On 30 July, a contract was once more concluded between Nassau and the Dernbachers, in which questions about the rights from the first peace treaty were clarified. On 21 May 1336 an agreement was also concluded between the Lords of Bicken and Nassau, in which they sold Hainchen Castle (with the bulk of the property belonging to it) to the Count, but received rights to reign around Ebersbach. In 1350, the Lords of Dernbach, with the help of the Lords of Bicken in Hainchen and with the support of the Landgrave, built the castle of New Dernbach in the Hessian territory of Blankenstein (Gladenbach). After the end of the feuds, the boundaries between Hessen and Nassau in the area were set, which remain still today as district boundaries. On 21 April 1486, a Heidenrich of Dernbach sold his remaining serfs in the Nassau area to the local count for a low price. With this, the Lordship of Dernbach was finally transferred to Nassau.

Cubano be, cubano bop: one hundred years of jazz in Cuba. p28 In 1927 came the premiere of the zarzuela La Niña Rita, o La Habana de 1830 at the Teatro Regina, with music by Grenet and Ernesto Lecuona. In this zarzuela, Grenet's number, the tango-congo Ay, Mamá Inéz, became a huge hit, and remains popular today and is often heard at wedding receptions. Its origins lie in a comparsa number of 1868, and in its new guise became one of the signature numbers for the vedette Rita Montaner. In 1930 he set a number of Nicolas Guillén's poems Motivos del son to music. Grenet left Cuba in 1932 after falling foul of some of Gerardo Machado's henchmen, for the lyric of his Lamento cubano, which had the line: :Ay Cuba hermosa, primorosa, por qué sufres hoy tantos quebrantos? (Beautiful Cuba, why do you suffer such troubles [disruption] today?) He returned after Machado was forced out of office. Whilst abroad in Spain he directed the orchestra for the operetta La virgen morena, in Barcelona. Next, in Paris, he directed the same work. In Paris, too, he played piano at La Cueva, the nightclub he partly owned, in the resident band of Julio Cueva. There he joined his brother Ernesto, who played percussion. It was here that playing La comparsa de los congos, that he realized the potential of this carnival rhythm. It has been said that he introduced the conga to America, and this may or may not be true. The Lecuona Cuban Boys, a touring band, were writing and playing congas at the same time. In 1936 he founded the night-club El Yumurí, on Broadway and 52nd St, New York City. This which featured a local Puerto Rican group led by Pedro Flores, and a cabaret. In 1938 Grenet presented the review La Conga in his club, and later put on a spectacular at the Teatro Hispano in New York, with the leading Cuban singer Panchito Riset (Havana, 21 October 1911-New York, 8 August 1988).Giro, Radamés 2007.

History Bosnia (around 1900) There have been Romani people in Bosnia and Herzegovina for more than 600 years. Roma are deemed to have arrived in the territory of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina by the 14th–15th centuries, and to have adopted Islam as the majority confession during the times of Ottoman rule (15th–19th centuries). Already then, Roma were stigmatised and had to live in settlements outside city boundaries.Humanity in Action Rousseau, as French consul in Bosnia and Herzegovina, estimated in 1866 a number of 9,965 or 1.1 percent of the population were Romani. Johann Roskiewicz estimated in 1867 the number of the \\"Gypsies\\" in Bosnia at 9,000 (1.2 percent) and in Herzegovina at 2,500 (1.1 percent), resulting in a total of 11,500 Romani. Attitudes towards Roma in Bosnia and Herzegovina hardened during the Austro-Hungarian forty-years rule (1878–1918), also due to rumours that Roma lived off immoral earnings. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica mentions 18,000 Romani in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1.6 percent). The worst period for Bosnian Roma came with World War Two, when Bosnia and Herzegovina was included in the Nazi-aligned Independent State of Croatia (NDH). It is estimated that 28,000 Roma perished in the conflict, in concentration and extermination camps such as Jasenovac. In Socialist Jugoslavia, the situation of Roma improved considerable, as they became officially recognised as a “national minority”, and came to enjoy a large degree of security and welfare. During the war in Bosnia of 1992–1995, the Roma suffered mistreatment by all conflict parties, being often considered as agents of the enemy, or forcefully conscripted. Over 30,000 Bosnian Roma were expelled based on ethnic cleansing. Roma were subject to inhumane conditions in concentration camps and entire communities were destroyed. Several Roma from Kosovo moved to Bosnia and Herzegovina during socialist times as well as again during the Kosovo war. Kosovo Roma still face issues with civil documentations due to the lack of recognition of Kosovo by Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Socio-economic conditions = Civil registration  Bosnia and Herzegovina has markedly tackled the situation of lack of civil registration documents and risks of statelessness, thanks to cooperation between the state authorities and NGOs, reducing the number of Roma persons without documents from some 3,000 to 57 in 2017. This result remains to be made sustainable, due to the risks of administrative complications linked to cases of temporary migration and the lack of recognition of documents for children born abroad.  Housing  Bosnian Roma settlement Zavidovići, self-built home of Jasmin O. and his family New social housing built with EU funds at Dolovi, Zavidovići Many Roma in BiH still live in informal settlements, without access to water and electricity, as well as collective centres for IDPs. The Ministry of Human Rights and Refugees, in cooperation with municipalities and thanks to EU funds (4 million EUR in 2012) is building housing solutions for 150 Roma families in 14 municipalities. The legalisation and improvement of living conditions in informal settlement is ongoing and is still uneven across the country. Local Action Plans are being dressed up by municipalities.  Employment  Most Roma in BiH either work in the informal economy or have no means of sustainance. The percentage of employed Roma is very low, less than 1% in the FBiH and Brčko District of BiH and in the RS it is less than 3%. Those who find employment tend not to register or self-identify as Roma anymore, to avoid social stigma. Lack of education and low skills add to problems of discrimination in the access to the labour market. Very few Roma are also registered as unemployed at the entities' Employment Bureaus. Public programmes to subsidize employment and self- employment of Roma population have achieved little results, due to the lack of retention of employees at the end of the projects. Some good examples of cooperation with big enterprises (e.g. \\"Bingo\\" supermarkets) have been registered too.  Education  Many Roma still face issues with access to education, in terms of both enrolment and completion of primary studies. In July 2010, the Council of Minister adopted the Revised Action Plan on the educational needs of Roma. The measures therein should be implemented by the 12 line ministries of education in entities and cantons and the department in Brčko District. Authorities provide textbooks, school transport, meals and other subsidies. Enrolment of Roma children in primary, secondary, as well as higher education has since increased, despite still concerningly high rates of drop-out. Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have issues with segregated education of Roma children.  Healthcare  Access to healthcare services remain difficult for a high share of the Roma population in BiH due to administrative and bureaucratic complications. Lack of school attendance and of registration as unemployment risks leaving many Roma citizens of BiH without health insurance coverage. Elderly Roma citizens face issues with seeing their right to health insurance recognised. Roma associations estimate that between 60-70% of the Roma population in BiH have access to health care.  Political participation =Associations and representatives  84 associations of Roma are registered in BiH, of which 64 are in the Federation (with 25 active ones), 18 in Republika Srpska and two in the Brčko District (one active). In the RS, 11 associations over 18 are members of the RS Roma Union (Savez Roma RS). Roma associations mostly operate at municipality level.  Statutory discrimination  Dervo Sejdić In the case Sejdić and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, the European Court of Human Rights in December 2009 found that the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina violated the rights of Mr Dervo Sejdić (a Roma representative) because of the arrangements reserving the candidacy for the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and for the House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the affiliates to the so-called \\"constituent peoples\\" (Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats), thus directly discriminating against other groups, including Roma and Jews, as well as citizens without ethno-national affiliation. Bosnia and Herzegovina has not yet amended its Constitution to bring it in line with the European Convention on Human Rights. Roma representatives take part in the National Minority Councils, legislative advisory bodies at state and entity levels in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  BiH Roma Committee BiH Roma Committee chairman Mujo Fafulić The Roma Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina is an advisory body to the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina, established since 2002 with the aim of advancing the protection of the Roma minority in BiH. The responsibilities of the body were further defined in 2012 and its current members were appointed in 2017.ACFC/SR/IV(2016)007, p. 52-53 Its current chairman is Mujo Fafulić from the Support Center for Roma “Romalen”, Kakanj. The Roma Committee is tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Strategy of Bosnia and Herzegovina for Addressing Roma Issues (Official Gazette of BiH, No. 67/05) and its action plans: the revised Roma Action Plan in the areas of Employment, Housing and Health (2017) and the Revised Plan on the Educational Needs of Roma in Bosnia and Herzegovina (2010).

Background Otepka was born in Chicago in 1915, and graduated from the Columbus School of Law. He served in the US Navy during World War II. Career Otepka was a Deputy Director of the United States State Department's Office of Security in the late 1950s and early 1960s. This was at the beginning of the Eisenhower Administration and Otepka's \\"Evaluations\\" section was faced with Senator Joseph McCarthy who was at the height of his power and making accusations that Communists and Communist sympathizers had infiltrated the U.S. Army and U.S. Department of State. Otepka was assisted by another newcomer to the State Department, William L. Uanna, who would soon head up \\"Physical Security\\" at State. Otepka, Uanna and R. W. Scott McLeod, another newcomer in Security at State, were mentioned in a 1954 article in The Reporter entitled \\"Big Brother at Foggy Bottom.\\" The article describes how the State Department implemented Eisenhower's answer to McCarthy - Executive Order 10450 - and the reaction to it by State's employees. The Office of Security was often simply known as \\"SY\\" and in the 1980s became the Diplomatic Security Service. Otepka was in charge of vetting clearances for the State Department, and he gained public attention when he was sidelined and then later fired by Secretary of State Dean Rusk. Otepka claimed he was punished for not clearing names proposed by the Kennedy administration for employment in the State Department. Some of these names had previously been banned during the Eisenhower administration, according to at least one source. Also, investigative journalist Clark Mollenhoff detailed the Otepka story in his 1965 book Despoilers of Democracy. Mollenhoff noted that Otepka was punished and subjected to illegal surveillance for giving testimony to Congress about security procedures at the State Department, as much as for his concern about the rampant use of emergency clearances by the Kennedy administration. Two officers, including Deputy Assistant Secretary John F. Reilly, perjured themselves before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee and had to resign in November 1963. However, Senate efforts notwithstanding, Otto Otepka was relegated to a meaningless position before his termination. So were some of his colleagues who had backed his efforts. By the late 1960s there was a Congressional hearing into the dismissal of Otepka but in the end Otepka was never returned to his previous station.

It was written in honour of a Mrs. Biddell, a widow and seamstress living in wretched conditions. In what was, at that time, common practice, Mrs. Biddell sewed trousers and shirts in her home using materials given to her by her employer for which she was forced to give a £2 deposit. In a desperate attempt to feed her starving infants, Mrs. Biddell pawned the clothing she had made, thus accruing a debt she could not pay. Mrs. Biddell, whose first name has not been recorded, was sent to a workhouse, and her ultimate fate is unknown; however, her story became a catalyst for those who actively opposed the wretched conditions of England’s working poor, who often spent seven days a week labouring under inhumane conditions, barely managing to survive and with no prospect for relief. The poem was published anonymously in the Christmas edition of Punch in 1843 and quickly became a phenomenon, centering people’s attention not only on Mrs. Biddell's case, but on the conditions of workers in general. Though Hood was not politically radical, his work, like that of Charles Dickens, contributed to the general awareness of the condition of the working class which fed the popularity of trade unionism and the push for stricter labour laws.

The inquiry is investigating whether Eastern Health was at fault in the reporting of erroneous and delayed test results to breast cancer patients between 1997 and 2005, and in then failing to report the full scope of these errors. The inquiry developed ramifications for regional and national politics as the opposition Liberal Party questioned why the regional Progressive Conservative Party government had not intervened sooner in the crisis, and said that former deputy health minister Robert Thompson, who had been appointed to chair the inquiry, should stand down, prompting Newfoundland and Labrador premier Danny Williams to accuse the Liberals of a smear campaign. The inquiry, chaired by Justice Margaret Cameron, was called in May 2007 and released a report in March 2009. Background In May 2005 Eastern Health discovered errors in hormone receptor breast cancer test results from a histology lab in St Johns, Newfoundland. The tests were designed to register patients' hormone levels, and determine whether they could benefit from potentially life-saving hormone oncology treatments. The board commissioned the re-testing of results from up to 1,500 patients and alerted the office of premier Danny Williams of this development and of potential ensuing media interest. An hour after first contacting Williams's office, the board sent a second message with what communications director Karen Matthews described to the inquiry as a \\"stand- down\\" notice, saying the issue had been minimized; Matthews responded by withdrawing the office from high alert over the case. Former health minister John Ottenheimer told the inquiry that he wished to publicize the testing failures when they emerged in May 2005, but deferred to Eastern Health's request that he leave them to handle the affair internally. After retesting, Eastern Health concluded that 383 patients had received erroneous results, of whom 117 required a change to their treatment programs In December 2006 the board held a series of media briefings on the hormone receptor test errors, downplaying the seriousness and extent of the problems. Despite the apparent conclusiveness of the inquiry report, epidemiological evidence to support such conclusions is lacking. The testing errors are expected in medical practice, and retesting of tissues over long period of time remains a controversial exercise due to the following factors leading to bias: 1. fluid state of medical technology 2. change in medical practice patterns and criteria for test interpretation 3. effects of prevalence in diagnostic testing. If one examines the test performed in 1998 using the technology of 2008, the inherited time bias is unavoidable. Nevertheless, even despite these biases, the clinical epidemiology of medical testing robustly predicts the expected test errors (due to test characteristics rather than due to problems with test performance) and these are closely matching the observed errors uncovered by Cameron Inquiry. Any medical test with 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity (and this was declared as a standard performance of ER and PR test in breast cancer in 2010 by ASCO) will not be expected to result in only 10% of false negative and 10% of false positive results. The expected test errors are subject to effect of prevalence in medical testing. Actual prevalence of ER positive breast cancer is in a range of 80%. By re-testing negative results the pathologists, in fact, tried to determine negative predictive value (NPV) of the test (i.e derive how many negative test results were true negative against reference laboratory). NPV is not a fixed or stable parameter of the test, as it will change with prevalence (interested readers can be referred to Bayesian methods in diagnostic testing). By making simple NPV formula calculations using the above listed test parameters one can derive negative predictive value of only about 60 - 65% (for a 90% sensitive and 90% specific test under condition of 80% prevalence of ER positive breast cancers in North American population). The expected error (false negative results) under such condition of prevalence will be close to 35-40% (1- negative predictive value). Formula Negative predictive value = True negative/ (Total tested negative) x 100, % This should not be confused with the fixed parameters of test performance - sensitivity and specificity. Reference : Hunink M. et al Decision Analysis in Health and Medicine, 2012. Press reports In May 2007 the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) published reports showing that Eastern Health knew the error rate for the screening tests to have been around 42%, considerably higher than the figure they disclosed in the December 2006 media briefings. The provincial government then called a judicial inquiry, commencing November 2007, into Eastern Health's actions. Conduct of the inquiry The inquiry saw dozens of witnesses between November 2007 and October 2008. In May 2008 the provincial government questioned the length of time the inquiry was taking, with justice minister Jerome Kennedy suggesting that continuing with the tone, style, and procedure of the inquiry could cause the health system to collapse. Chair Margaret Cameron declined the government's application to prevent inquiry lawyers from cross-examining witnesses, which had been presented as an attempt to expedite the inquiry. Opposition leader Yvonne Jones accused premier Williams of trying to \\"undermine\\" the inquiry by questioning testimony and witness examination procedures, including one occasion on which Williams described the inquiry in May 2008 as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Jones also said that former deputy health minister Robert Thompson, a Progressive Conservative who had been commissioned to oversee the inquiry, had a conflict of interest and should stand down. Williams responded critically to what he called an attempt by Jones to smear senior public health officials. Peter Dawe of the Canadian Cancer Society objected to Williams's perceived attempts to speed up the inquiry, saying that patients deserved a full investigation however long it took. Inquiry report The inquiry finished hearing testimony in October 2008 and was due to report by March 1, 2009. Lawsuit In 2007, after the revelation that Eastern Health had deliberately concealed the scope of the testing errors, hundreds of patients filed a class action lawsuit against Eastern Health over the affair.

Early life Bell was born in Brooklyn to Samuel Bell, a manufacturer of children's clothing, and, Claire Bodan Bell, a designer. When Bell was in junior high school the family moved to Montreal. Bell returned to New York City in 1960 and found a job writing jacket copy for children's books. He soon became director of publicity for children's books at Viking Press, later leaving Viking Press to work at Random House. An early member of the Gay Liberation Front and a founding member of the Gay Activists Alliance in New York City, wrote two books. Dancing the Gay Lib Blues was published in 1971 and he published Kings Don't Mean a Thing in 1978. Journalism Bell wrote his first piece for the Village Voice in 1969, an account of the Stonewall riots, a confrontation between police and the patrons of a gay bar called the Stonewall Inn that became a flashpoint of the Gay Liberation movement. He became a regular columnist in 1976 with his column \\"Bell Tells\\". After Variety reporter Addison Verrill, an acquaintance of Bell's, was killed in his apartment in 1977, Bell wrote about the case in the Voice. In response he received a telephone call from someone claiming to have been the killer who, while generally appreciative of the piece, objected to being characterized as a \\"psychopath\\". The caller left some clues to his identity, and after Bell informed the police, they went to his apartment to wait in case the caller called again. A second caller identified the first to Bell as Paul Bateson, and police went to Bateson's apartment in Greenwich Village and arrested him. Bateson was later convicted of second-degree murder and served almost a quarter-century in prison. In connection with the case, Bell wrote a series of columns about a string of unsolved murders of gay men; these columns, along with the novel Cruising by Gerald Walker, were the inspiration behind the William Friedkin film Cruising. Bell wrote additional columns condemning Friedkin and Cruising after reading a leaked early screenplay, deploring what he viewed as its negative depiction of gay people and claiming that it would inspire violence against homosexuals.Williams, p. 135. At Bell's urging, gay activists disrupted the filming of Cruising and demonstrated at theatres where the film was playing. Personal life Bell met author Arthur Evans, at the time a film distributor, and the two entered into a relationship in 1964. They parted on bad terms in 1971, and Bell included an unflattering portrait of Evans in his book Dancing the Gay Lib Blues. The two reconstructed their friendship and Bell dedicated his second book Kings Don't Mean a Thing to Evans. Death Bell died June 2, 1984 at the age of 44 from complications related to diabetes.

Her father was the grandson of le Grand Condé, while her mother, Louise Françoise de Bourbon, was the eldest surviving legitimised daughter of Louis XIV of France and his maîtresse-en-titre, Madame de Montespan. Biography=Early life Born at the Palace of Versailles, Louise Anne was the fourth child and third daughter of her parents. Her eldest sisters were Marie Anne Gabrielle Éléonore de Bourbon and Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon. She was baptised in the chapel of Versailles on 24 November 1698 with her brother Louis Henri and her sister Louise Élisabeth. Louise Anne's father died in 1710, eleven months after having inherited the title of Prince de Condé at the death of his own father. Since her first cousin, Louis d'Orléans, never had a daughter who survived into adulthood, Louise Anne became known at court by the style of Mademoiselle, which she held from 1728 when Louis' daughter, Louise Marie d'Orléans, died at the age of one. During the Regency During the Régence of her cousin, Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, she became romantically involved with the Duke of Richelieu, a grandnephew of Cardinal Richelieu. At the same time, the Duke of Richelieu also began an affair with Louise Anne's first cousin, Charlotte Aglaé d'Orléans, known at court as Mademoiselle de Valois. The two cousins, rivals in love, would later both fight fiercely, but separately, for the liberation of the duke from his incarceration in the Bastille due to his participation in the Cellamare Conspiracy. Louise Anne never married. At one time, she was considered as a possible bride for her cousin, Louis Auguste, Prince of Dombes, but she refused. Another proposed husband was the Duke of Chartres, the son of the Regent, and heir to the House of Orléans. His mother, however, wanted a more prestigious marriage for her son with a young German princess. Voltaire, a friend of Richelieu, wrote the following verse concerning Louise-Anne: :Frère ange de Charolois :Dis-nous par quelle aventure :Le cordon de Saint François :Sert à Vénus de ceinture. Reign of Louis XV As the years passed, Louise Anne constantly intrigued for political prominence. She would later help her cousin Louis XV in his search for new mistresses. It was common gossip at the time that Louise Anne was actually one of the king's former mistresses; that she was his first unofficial sexual partner after his wife, possibly as early as the late 1720s, and that they had an on-and-off-affair for a few years and that she introduced him to prospective new mistresses. Edmond et Jules de Goncourt: La duchesse de Châteauroux et ses soeurs, Paris, 1906 However, other contemporaries claim that while Louise Anne did wish to become his lover and did attempt to seduce him, she never actually succeeded to become his mistress. Louis XV intime et les petites maitresses The king did, in any case, enjoy her company, and she belonged to his circle of personal friends and frequently attended court. Louise Anne's older sister, Louise Élisabeth, introduced Madame de Pompadour to the French court in the 1740s. The Hôtel de Rothelin-Charolais Louise Anne owned several estates. In 1735, she became the owner of the Hôtel de Rothelin- Charolais in Paris, which became her townhouse. She would later sell the lands at Vallery, in the Bourgogne province of France, which had been the traditional burial place of her Condé ancestors. She also owned various châteaux such as the one at Athis outside Paris. She later sold the estate of Charolais to the Crown and in return got land in Palaiseau, which further augmented her personal real estate holdings. Louise Anne died in Paris, at the Hôtel de Rothelin-Charolais, at the age of sixty-two. She was buried in the Carmelite Convent of the Faubourg Saint-Jacques. Her brother, Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon, and her two sisters, Marie Anne de Bourbon and Élisabeth Alexandrine de Bourbon, were also buried there.

The 2011 Croatian census found 16,675 Romani in Croatia or 0.4% of the population. In 2001, more than half of the Romani population was located in the Međimurje County and the City of Zagreb. A considerable number of Romani refugees in Croatia are from the ethnic conflict in Bosnia. In the 2011 census, the largest religious groups among the Romani were Catholics (8,299 or 49.77% of them), Muslims (5,039 or 30.22% of them) and Eastern Orthodox (2,381 or 14.02% of them). There are more than 120 Romani minority NGOs in Croatia. One of the most prominent is Croatian Roma Union and Alliance of Roma in the Republic of Croatia \\"Kali Sara\\". History=Origin The Romani people originally came to Europe from Northern India,Current Biology. presumably from the northwestern Indian states of Rajasthan and Punjab. The linguistic evidence has indisputably shown that roots of the Romani language lie in India: the language has grammatical characteristics of Indian languages and shares with them a big part of the basic lexicon, for example, body parts or daily routines. More exactly, Romani shares the basic lexicon with Hindi and Punjabi. It shares many phonetic features with Marwari, while its grammar is closest to Bengali. Genetic findings in 2012 suggest the Romani originated in northwestern India and migrated as a group. According to a genetic study in 2012, the ancestors of present scheduled tribes and scheduled caste populations of northern India, traditionally referred to collectively as the Ḍoma, are the likely ancestral populations of the modern European Roma. In February 2016, during the International Roma Conference, the Indian Minister of External Affairs stated that the people of the Roma community were children of India. The conference ended with a recommendation to the Government of India to recognize the Roma community spread across 30 countries as a part of the Indian diaspora. Migration to Croatia Romani people were mentioned for the first time in the Republic of Ragusa in 1362 in some commercial records. Ten years later, Romani were recorded as being in Zagreb, where they were merchants, tailors and butchers. Various Romani groups have lived in Croatia since the 14th century. In the Middle Ages Roma living in cities lived together with rest of the population. According to litteras promotorias, nomad Romani groups also had the authority to resolve independently all intragroup conflicts. Maria Theresa and Joseph II, in regulations issued in 1761, 1767 and 1783, outlawed the Romani nomadic lifestyle, forced them to accept local clothing codes and languages, made regulations regarding personal and family names and limited their choice of professions. Large groups of Roma arrived in Croatia in the 19th century from Romania after the abolition of Romani slavery there in 1855. World War II About 20,000 Croatian Romani were executed by Ustasha police officers during World War II. Culture=Language Three groups of dialects of the Romani language present in the region are Carpathian Romani, Balkan Romani and Vlax Romani language. Religion In the 2011 census, the largest religious groups among the Romani were Catholics (8,299 or 49.77% of them), Muslims (5,039 or 30.22% of them) and Eastern Orthodox (2,381 or 14.02% of them). Romani in modern Croatia In the Republic of Croatia, Romani have remained largely marginalized, so the government has a programme to provide them with systematic assistance in order to improve their living conditions and to include them in the social life. According to a survey conducted in 1998, 70% of surveyed families at the time did not have any permanently employed family members, 21% had one member, and 6% had two permanently employed members. Additional risks include poor housing conditions, inadequate clean water supplies and inadequate electricity infrastructure in Romani settlements, poor health care and low average level of education. The Romani elect a special representative to the Croatian Parliament shared with members of eleven other national minorities. The first such member of parliament, Nazif Memedi, was elected in the 2007 parliamentary election. In 2010, Romani were added to the preamble of the Croatian Constitution and thereby recognized as one of the autochthonous national minorities. In 2012 the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb introduced for the first time courses titled Romani language I and Literature and culture of Roma. Roma in Međimurje County According to estimates and available data, at the beginning of 2009 in Međimurje County there lived about 5,500 Roma, 4.7% of the total population, which made them the largest national minority group in the county. According to the census in 2011, 2,887 people (2.44%) identified themselves as Romani. The difference between the census data and the actual Roma population can be explained by the fact that many Roma choose not to reveal their minority affiliation due to stigmatization. For example, in Donja Dubrava municipality, according to the 2001 census there wasn't a single Roma living there, even though at that time in the municipality there were little Romani settlements with about 70 people. Altogether there are twelve settlements in Međimurje where the Romani minority live. A concentration of Roma in some settlements, and in certain peripheral streets of some settlements show territorial segregation of Roma within the county. In more than half of Međimurje municipalities, Roma are not present or are present in very small numbers.

This forced him in 1708 to ask permission of Rome to resign and move to Italy, a request that was not granted. During the plague that spread from 1708 he distinguish himself for the help and the pastoral care he offered to the sick until he too was infected. Early in 1713 he chose as successor Timothy Maroge and died of plague a few months later in 1713 (or according to other sources in 1712) at the age of 46. Works Joseph is remembered as a Syriac and Arabic writer and for having translated many texts from Latin. His Speculum tersum (Book of the pure Mirror) was translated from Syriac into Latin by I. A.

The first manor house was made out of wood and the new palace was built in 1800–1804 in the late classical style, designed according to the project by the German architect J. G. Berlitz. Kazdanga established the first Latvian fish pond, now in operation for a number of important agricultural schools. History The palace was built in the years 1800–1804 in the style of late classicism, built by the project of Johann Gottfried Adam Berlitz. There is stone bridge, leading to the palace. On the other side of the river there are remnants of the manor buildings; house of the servants, stables, house of the steward and barns. The palace was burned down by local peasants during the Revolution of 1905. However, German baron von Manteuffel renovated it by the project of Paul Schultze-Naumburg in 1907. The renovation of the Kazdanga palace became an important event for the development of the Neo-Classicism style. It was designed by the well known German architect and Neo-Classicism Paul Schultze- Naumburg. In contrast to scenic, borrowed forms, the architect declared a return to the Homeland tradition and accuracy. The reconstruction of the Kazdanga palace demonstrated a new approach by the architect to the original image of the building. The palace, designed in about 1800, was one of the most splendid monuments of Classicism architecture in Courland. Its restoration served as a starting point for reevaluating both patterns of pure Classicism and local building traditions. Even elements of scientific restoration could be observed in the course of reconstruction. The principle of historical verity was important in designing the interiors and replicas of the furniture that had been destroyed.D.Bruģis Historisma pilis Latvijā. Rīga. 1997. 283lpp. (in Latvian) During the First World War the palace was again devastated. It was rebuilt between 1925 and 1927. In 1930 the Kazdanga Agricultural Trade School was housed in the palace. The school is still situated there. Near to the palace is a house of chevaliers. It has a well-preserved interior, like baroque-style stairs and ornamented parquet floor.

Background Fraise was a bay horse bred by Allen E. Paulson. He was sired by Strawberry Road, the 1983 Australian Horse of the Year, acquired by Paulson in 1986. His dam, Zalataia, acquired by Paulson in 1983, raced in France and the United States, notably winning the Grand Prix de Deauville and the Grade I Oak Tree Invitational Stakes. Fraise, which is french for strawberry, was raced by Madeleine Paulson, who won the colt on a wager with her husband by beating him in a golf game. Racing career Trained for racing on turf by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Bill Mott, Fraise did not race at age two but made ten starts in 1991 at age three, notably winning the Round Table Handicap at Chicago's Arlington Park. Age four was Fraise's best year in racing when he won five of his ten starts. He got his first Grade I win in the Sword Dancer Handicap at Saratoga Race Course on August 8, 1992, setting a course record while winning by four lengths. He followed this up with a fourth-place finish in the Man o' War Stakes and a second place in the Turf Classic Invitational, both at Belmont. On October 31, the mile-and-a-half Breeders' Cup Turf was hosted by Gulfstream Park Racetrack in Hallandale Beach, Florida. Facing a top-class international field, Fraise was sent off at odds of 14-1. He was up against Sky Classic, the even-money favorite from Canada, Subotica, that year's winner of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, and two Epsom Derby winners, Dr Devious (1992) and Quest for Fame (1991). Fraise was in the last place for most of the race, then started his move on the far turn with jockey Patrick Valenzuela guiding him through traffic. As they entered the stretch, Valenzuela spotted a small hole on the rail and Fraise responded with a strong drive to win by a nose over Sky Classic (ridden by Pat Day). He finished the year in the Hollywood Turf Cup Stakes, in which he was disqualified to second for interference. In the Eclipse Award voting for champion turf male, Fraise finished second to Sky Classic. Fraise returned to racing at age five, starting with a win in the Grade II Pan American Handicap at Gulfstream Park in Florida. He then suffered a splint injury while finishing third in the San Juan Capistrano at Santa Anita and missed several months. In October, he finished fifth in the Turf Classic at Belmont, then finished fourth in the Breeders' Cup Turf despite a rough trip. He ended the year in the Grade I Hollywood Turf Cup Stakes at Hollywood Park Racetrack in California, winning by a stakes record six lengths. At age six, Fraise raced seven times with one win in the Pan American Handicap before his breeding rights were sold to Japanese interests. Fraise finished his career with a tenth-place finish in the 1994 Japan Cup. Retirement In Japan, Fraise entered stud duty in 1995. He stood for eight years but was largely unsuccessful. Eventually gelded, he was used as a lesson horse at the Olympic Riding Club in Chiba, Japan. In the summer of 2005, original owner Madeleine Paulson provided the Old Friends Equine retirement facility in Georgetown, Kentucky with a substantial gift to enable them to acquire the horse, bring him home from Japan, and look after him during his retirement years. On November 7, 2005, the seventeen-year-old Fraise died suddenly from a ruptured blood vessel in his abdomen. He was cremated and his remains were interred in the Old Friends Dream Chase Farm cemetery.

Dan Slott era=Chaos Cascade (Issues #21-23) * Writer: Dan Slott, Artist: Khoi Pham With a series of events causing chaos around the world, the Scarlet Witch recruits a new team of Avengers while Hercules tries to do the same. Henry Pym becomes The Wasp, and the Scarlet Witch sends the Avengers to deal with the threat at Wundagore Mountain, where it becomes apparent that her brother Quicksilver is being used as a vessel for Chthon. Iron Man arrives after battling the Hulk in Wundagore and challenges The Wasp for leadership, but leaves after helping them to defeat Chthon. The new team led by The Wasp includes Hercules, Amadeus Cho, and the U.S. Agent, plus Stature and Vision from the Young Avengers. It is also revealed that the \\"Scarlet Witch\\" is actually Loki in disguise, who is manipulating the Avengers in order to embarrass Norman Osborn. Chasing Ghosts (Issues #24) * Writer: Dan Slott, Artist: Rafa Sandoval The Mighty Avengers become an international team, following information from the \\"Scarlet Witch\\" to dozens of hot spots around the globe. Quicksilver, who initially did not want to join, chases the Avengers from country to country in search of his sister, and eventually joins the team after helping them defeat Titan. Mighty/Fantastic (Issues #25-26) * Writer: Dan Slott, Artist: Stephen Segovia In escaping H.A.M.M.E.R. agents, Jocasta inadvertently untethered the Mighty Avengers' \\"PymPocket\\" base from reality, causing its dimensional doorways to slowly fade. Henry Pym contacts Reed Richards, hoping to borrow a device that had been left in the Fantastic Four's care by Bill Foster. Reed refuses, and Pym decides to have his team break in the Baxter Building and steal the device. Despite Reed's best attempts, Pym is successful, and manages to move the Pym Pocket to a new dimensional location. However, the degradation of the dimensional gateways requires Jocasta to be integrated into the system in order to hold it together. The Unspoken (Issues #27-31) * Writer: Dan Slott Artist: Khoi Pham While the rest of the team settles into their new base, \\"The Infinite Avengers Mansion\\", U.S. Agent and Quicksilver encounter The Unspoken in China. Quicksilver explains that The Unspoken was the Inhumans' former king, before he was deposed and banished by his cousin Black Bolt for his power-hungry ways. Before the two can act, The People's Defense Force (China's Superteam) accost The Unspoken, demanding he leave the country. The Unspoken responds by defeating them in an instant, prompting U.S. Agent to suggest calling not just their team, but all the Avengers teams to combat such a threat. Meanwhile, Stature desires revenge against the Scarlet Witch for the death of her father and has lured the Young Avengers to assist her. Ronin (Clint Barton) follows them, also desiring revenge against \\"Wanda\\". During the fight, Wiccan uses his powers to break through Loki's illusion, but the villain retreats before he is fully revealed. While Hercules and Amadeus call the other Avengers teams for help, USAgent, Quicksilver and the recovered Chinese heroes attack The Unspoken, who uses Xerogen Crystal powder to turn them into Alpha Primitives. The other Avengers (barring Osborn's groups) join the battle, but many of them also succumb to the powder's effects. At the same time, Pym is exploring the outer reaches of existence. There, he encounters Eternity, who thanks him for saving his being from succumbing to the chaos wave, and tells him that he is the universe's Scientist Supreme. Upon his return to the universe, Pym marshalls the remaining Avengers, having Amadeus and Hercules infiltrate the \\"Slave Engine\\", which contains a supply of Xerogen Crystals, and disable it. Pym then uses the engine's chronal ray, used to accelerate the growth of the crystals, on The Unspoken, turning him into a weak old man. Mighty/Dark (Issues #32-33) * Writer: Dan Slott Artist: Khoi Pham Loki engineers the escape of Crusher Creel, manipulating him into raiding Project Pegasus, bringing Norman Osborn's Dark Avengers to the scene. He also takes on Scarlet Witch's appearance once more in order to bring the Mighty Avengers to the same place. As Osborn's group is in the middle of a press conference, he can not afford to fight Pym's publicly popular team, and grudgingly joins forces with them. Creel then appears, having absorbed the power of a Cosmic Cube fragment. As their two teams attempt to stop Creel, Pym and Osborn both realise that Creel's wrecking ball, which shares his powers, has also turned into a Cosmic Cube, and race to retrieve it. Osborn is first, but Pym tricks him into believing that he had already gotten it, claiming that the Dark Reign was made possible by the Cube's power. Pym then knocks Osborn out, and uses the Cube as a weapon against Creel, with limited results. Loki then appears, and provides Osborn with a mystical blade, which has the ability to remove Creel's Asgardian-born powers. Using the weapon, Osborn defeats Creel, making himself look like a hero in the eyes of the watching media. Osborn uses his status as head of H.A.M.M.E.R to decommission USAgent, removing him from the Mighty Avengers. Pym's Avengers return to the Infinite Mansion, where Pym consoles himself with the fact that he recorded Loki's image, and now has a scan of his retina. Pre-Siege Mentality (Issue #34) * Writer: Dan Slott Artist: Neil Edwards Hank Pym is finally forced to tell Pietro that the \\"Scarlet Witch\\" is actually Loki in disguise. Desperate to find out where Wanda is, Pietro joins the team in an attempt to capture Loki. The Mighty Avengers go to the Isle of Silence, to a palace where Loki makes an annual pilgrimage. When Loki arrives, he is captured by device designed by Pym, which manages to nullify his magic, trapping him. Pietro demands to know where Wanda is, using Pym's device to torture Loki when he claims not to know. Loki mentally calls Thor for help, who briefly battles the Mighty Avengers. Pym agrees to release Loki, in return for him truthfully answer Pietro question. Loki truthfully answers that he does not know where Wanda is. Pym then requests that Loki join his team, to the shock and disgust of the others. Loki declines, and is taken by Thor to Balder, and the rest of the team decide to leave, believing Pym has gone too far. Back at the Infinity Mansion, Jocasta, who has been experiencing problems with her duplicate bodies, is overwhelmed by the programming of Ultron, her eyes glowing red. Salvation (Issue #35-36) Ultron is shown to infiltrate Jocasta and the Infinite Avengers Mansion. He names himself Ultron Pym and seeks to kill and replace his father before using his Infinite Mansion to conquer the universe. Amadeus Cho, now on his own after the death of Hercules, receives word that the Thunderbolts have been sent by Norman Osborn to steal a powerful spear belonging to Odin. He calls on U.S.Agent, Stature and Vision for help stopping them. Pym is eventually able to make Ultron leave by marrying him to Jocasta. He then goes to help Amadeus Cho and his team, battling as The Mighty Avengers one last time.

The film  The documentary tells the story of Parhat Ablat, a young Muslim from an ethnic minority in the deserts of Western China, who leads the fight against racial segregation through baseball. The population of Xinjiang Province, China is divided between two ethnic groups: the indigenous Muslim Uyghurs and the ruling Han Chinese, who gained control of the region in 1755 from the Dzungar kingdom. Uyghur and Han speak different languages, practice different religions, live and work in different neighborhoods, and even set their watches two hours apart―Han operate on Beijing time, Uyghurs on unofficial local time. There is one place, however, where the segregation line is broken: on the baseball field. Although Uyghur and Han Chinese students at Xinjiang University take separate classes and live in separate dormitories, there are not enough players of one or the other ethnicity to field a whole team. They need each other to play baseball. Diamond in the Dunes follows this team and their charismatic captain, Parhat Ablat, in their struggle to overcome ethnic differences and prepare for their only game of the season: an all-in match up against a team of Tibetans from Qinghai Province. The film is directed by Christopher Rufo.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3309155/ This is his third documentary film.  Summary and background  Diamond in the Dunes opens with pastoral shots of Parhat Ablat, a young Muslim Uyghur, farming and herding sheep on his homestead outside Kashgar. Parhat says goodbye to his family and gets on the train for Urumqi, the capital of China's Xinjiang Province, where he attends university. The population of this hardscrabble region is divided between two ethnic groups: the indigenous Muslim Uyghurs and the ruling Han Chinese, who gained control of the region in 1755 from the Dzungar kingdom. Uyghur and Chinese speak different languages, practice different religions, live and work in different neighborhoods, and even set their watches two hours apart―Chinese operate on Beijing time, Uyghurs on unofficial local time. Parhat, pitcher and captain of Xinjiang University's baseball team, explains that classes and dormitories at Xinjiang University are segregated, but on baseball team, both Uyghur and Chinese students play side-by-side. When a package of donated baseball equipment arrives from the US, Parhat shares his excitement with Yusufu, one of his Chinese teammates. During Xinjiang's brutal winter, the team begins to practice underground and racial tensions between Uyghur and Chinese come to a point. Parhat must bring both sides of the team together and remind them that if the conflict persists, the team may be disbanded by the University. On and off the field, Parhat's goal is to raise poor Uyghur students out of what he calls the Uyghurs' 'spirit sickness.' He teaches quantum mechanics to a class of Uyghur physics students, counsels the younger players on the team, and starts a baseball team at the local elementary school. At the end of the season, the Xinjiang University team is invited to compete against the next-closest baseball team, the Qinghai Tibetan College, more than 2,000 miles to the east. On the train, the novice players brush up on the strike zone and force out rule. Finally, both teams face off for their only game of the season. The Xinjiang team plays hard, but Tibetans are too strong: the final score is 16-0. After the game, the mood is dour and the players look to Parhat for leadership. He assures them that the experience of defeat is important and a lesson can be learned: work hard, never forget your goals, and you will ultimately succeed. The final sequence takes us back to Parhat's village. At sunset, he goes into the streets in his baseball uniform, finds a group of kids, and begins teaching them baseball. Night falls and the kids ask his name. \\"Parhat,\\" he says, which in Uyghur means 'hero.' Drawing from more than 100 hours of material, the film employs the cinéma vérité style, with no oncamera interviews or outside narration. The film favors a personal and psychological, rather than overtly political approach. The score is drawn from 100 minutes of Uyghur folk music, and includes drones extracted and reconditioned from the folk melodies and other sound design elements by Thomas Park of the musical act 'Mystified'.

History=Founding The group was founded in 1933 by Roberta Martin, who in that same year had just become acquainted with gospels music, which was different from the traditional spirituals which were popular at the time. Theodore Frye and Thomas A. Dorsey were directing a junior choir at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Chicago, Illinois, and asked Martin to serve as the accompanist. From this junior choir, Martin selected six young men at random to form a group, Eugene Smith, Norsalus McKissick, Robert Anderson, Willie Webb, James Lawrence, and W.C. Herman. This group was named the Martin and Frye Singers, and in 1936, the group adopted the name of The Roberta Martin Singers. The Roberta Martin Singers (RMS) contained no traditional bass. For a brief period of time, the group was known as the Martin and Martin Singers, when Sallie Martin joined Roberta's group. That venture was short lived. In 1939, Anderson briefly left the group and returned in 1941 before departing for a final time in 1943, also in 1939, Martin added the first female voice to the group, Bessie Folk. By the mid-1940s, the RMS added two more women to their ranks, Sadie Durrah and Delois Barrett (Campbell), who would go on to found the Barrett Sisters. Recording In 1947, the group made their first recording for Fidelity Records as the \\"Roberta Martin Singers of Chicago\\", singing \\"Precious Memories\\" with Norsalus McKissick on lead. After the group's first release, the RMS made more recordings, for Religious Records of Detroit, Michigan through 1947, and for Apollo Records beginning in 1949 through 1955. Some of their most popular releases during this time include \\"Old Ship of Zion\\" (1949), \\"Yield Not to Temptation\\" (1947), \\"He Knows How Much You Can Bear\\" (1949), \\"Only a Look\\" (1949), and Eugene Smith's composition, \\"The Lord Will Make a Way\\" (1951). Most of these recordings featured only a piano, organ, and the occasional drum accompaniment. Martin's piano playing was done in such a way that she combined both classical music and blues in her piano playing. Martin played mainly in the middle of the keyboard, providing secondary beats in the upper ranges of the keyboard, and bringing each song to a ritard at the end. Group changes In 1949, Eugene Smith became the group's business manager and booking agent as Martin began to concentrate on publishing music and running her own music school. Members were added or replaced older members, such as the addition of Romance Watson in 1949, and Myrtle Scott and Myrtle Jackson in 1951. Martin also began to team up with a young James Cleveland, who composed songs for the group such as \\"I'm Determined\\" (1953), \\"Every Now and Then\\" (1957) and \\"Since I Met Him\\" (1961). Some members left to form their own groups or to sing in other groups. Willie Webb left to form the Willie Webb Singers in 1949, but returned to the group in 1953. In late 1950, Norsalus McKissick and Bessie Folk teamed up with James Cleveland to form the Gospelaires. The Gospelaires didn't last long, and McKissick was back with the RMS by 1951, Folk by 1955. In 1956, more changes were made to the group. Willie Webb, who had served as a singer and organist for the group prior to 1949 and during 1953–1956 left, and was replaced by Lucy \\"Little Lucy\\" Smith (Collier), Martin's step daughter. Smith had previously been featured as the organist on their 1949–1952 recordings and would occasionally vocalize with the group. This time, her stay with the group would last over a decade. Smith's singing would become more substantial, becoming a regular background vocalist and soloist in 1957. Beginning in 1959, Smith would occasionally leave the organist's duties to the Savoy studio organist and accompany the group on the piano during recording sessions. Smith's organist skills were so popular that in 1962, Savoy released an LP of gospel instrumentals with Smith's organ as the only accompaniment titled Little Lucy Smith at the Organ. By 1963, Smith replaced Martin as the regular pianist and musical director on their recordings. Gloria Griffin was brought on board in 1957 to replace Bessie Folk, who'd been involved in a serious auto accident and could not sing in the group as a result. Recording for Savoy With these new members, the group began recording for Savoy Records. Their first session with Savoy was on January 31, 1957 in New York City. In 1958, the RMS scored their first big hit with Savoy records, \\"God Specializes\\" featuring Gloria Griffin on lead. 1958 also brought Archie Dennis into the group as a replacement for Romance Watson, as Watson began a solo career recording soul music for Coral Records. Dennis made his debut with the RMS at a program accompanying the Reverend C.L. Franklin in a weeklong revival at the Music Hall in Houston, Texas. The first recording session to feature Dennis with the RMS wasn't made until 1959. Later that year, Dennis left the RMS to serve in the US Army. Dennis's place was taken by Harold Johnson until Dennis was honorably discharged in 1961 and returned to the group. In 1962, former member Bessie Folk returned to the RMS to record with them on their album titled Out of the Depths. During 1963, Bessie Folk left for a final time to join the Sallie Martin Singers, the RMS recorded their first live album and made their first transatlantic trip to sing at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy. During their time with Savoy, the group made more popular recordings, including \\"Grace\\" (1958), \\"\\"Hold the Light\\" (1959), \\"No Other Help I Know\\" (1962) and \\"There Is No Failure in God\\" (1963), among others. Slowing down By the mid-1960s, the group was beginning to slow down. Delois Barrett-Campbell left the group in 1966, with Roberta Martin's encouragement, to embark on an independent career with the Barrett Sisters. She was replaced by Louise McCord. Gloria Griffin departed the group in 1967 to embark on a solo career, as well. Earlier in the decade, Martin ceased playing piano for the group, and Lucy Smith became the group's accompanist and musical director. Under the direction of Smith, the sound of the group began to change slightly, as song arrangements become more choral sounding in nature, drum beats became more prevalent than in previous recordings, and the electric bass guitar was added. It was also during this time that Roberta Martin became ill. Martin retired the group for a short period of time in the mid 60's, though the group came together in 1968 to record an album titled Praise God. Barrett-Campbell returned to the group for the session, as did Martin, and new group member, Catherine Austin. Martin had experienced a short rebound from her illness and was able to lead one song on the album I Have Hope, which was written by Jessie Jimerson a.k.a. Jessie Phillips, a longtime friend of Roberta Martin and childhood friend of James Cleveland. Shortly after the recording, Martin's health took a severe decline, which effectively made \\"I Have Hope\\" the last song she ever recorded. On January 18, 1969, Roberta Martin died of cancer. Without their leader, the Roberta Martin Singers tried to continue but eventually disbanded in 1970. Solo careers After Martin's death and the disbanding of the group, the former group members began to focus their attention on solo careers and careers with other groups. Delois Barrett-Campbell began working full-time with her group, the Barrett Sisters, and sang with them regularly until her health began to decline around 2006. Archie Dennis toured and sang with the Rev. Billy Graham Association from 1972–1977 before founding his own church in 1986. Louise McCord recorded material with Rev. James Cleveland and the Voices of Tabernacle in the late 60s before embarking on a solo career recording for Stax, and was featured in the Wattstax concert of 1972. After her time with Stax, McCord went on to record for Savoy Records. Gloria Griffin released her first solo album in 1967 for Atlantic Records, and worked with Rev. Donald Vails in the following decades. Willie Webb became the accompanist for the Chicago-based Rock of Ages television program during the 1970s and 1980s. During the early 1970s, Lucy Smith Collier became the accompanist for the Chicago-based Jubilee Showcase television program. In the mid or late 1970s, Collier suffered a stroke which paralyzed her on one side, rendering her unable to play the piano or organ. Collier's stroke did not diminish her singing ability, and she continued to sing and record occasionally until the 1990s. Reunion concerts The group came together for a series of reunion concerts in 1981, commemorating a Smithsonian Conference on Roberta Martin, consisting of Eugene Smith, Norsalus McKissick, Archie Dennis, Romance Watson, Delois Barrett-Campbell, Louise McCord, Gloria Griffin, Bessie Folk, Lucy Smith Collier, and Richard Smallwood as accompanist. More reunion concerts followed into the 1990s. The number of former Roberta Martin Singers began to dwindle, with the deaths of James Lawrence in 1990; Gloria Griffin, Myrtle Scott, and Robert Anderson in 1995; Norsalus McKissick in 1997; Bessie Folk on February 1, 2001; Rev. Archie L. Dennis on October 26, 2001; Eugene Smith on May 9, 2009; Lucy Smith Collier on September 19, 2010; and Delois Barrett Campbell on August 2, 2011.

He is currently a professor of Japanese poetry, Buddhism, and philosophy at the University of Haifa in Israel and lives in Galilee. Biography Born in Braşov, Romania to Jewish parents of Austro- Hungarian culture, at the age of one Hoffmann and his parents fled a Europe increasingly under Nazi influence for the British Mandate of Palestine. Shortly after the move, Hoffmann's mother died and he was entrusted by his father to an orphanage where he spent his time until his father remarried. As a young man, Hoffmann left his home in Israel and traveled to Japan, where he spent two years living in a Zen monastery and studying Chinese and Japanese texts with monks. He would later return to Japan to earn his doctorate. Hoffmann did not begin writing fiction until in his forties, and though chronologically a member of the sixties \\"Generation of the State,\\" his work is oft-described as being on the forefront of avant-garde Hebrew literature, with an influence of his Japanese studies discernible in his works. Hoffmann's first book of fiction, Kätzchen - The Book of Joseph, was published in Hebrew in 1988. He has since gone on to write ten more books in Hebrew, seven of which have been translated into English and published by New Directions; these seven are Katschen and The Book of Joseph (1998), Bernhard (1998), The Christ of Fish (1999), The Heart is Katmandu (2001), The Shunra and the Schmetterling (2004), Curriculum Vitae (2009), and Moods (2015). Hoffmann was awarded the first ever Koret Jewish Book Award, as well as the Bialik Prize by the city of Tel Aviv and the Prime Minister's Prize.

It is located southeast of Jamestown, in the interior of the island, and is the only district to lack a coastline. Description Terrain in the district is quite varied with steep ridges and a limited amount of flat ground, as befits the island's volcanic origin. The district was created in the early 1990s from parts of Jamestown and Longwood Districts. There is no settlement by that name, however, as it was named after the gun battery that used to be fired when unidentified ships were spotted. It includes the areas of The Briars, Seaview, Two Gun Saddle, Hunts Vale and Alarm Hill. Alarm Forest is the only district that does not border the ocean. Its population has grown from 276 in 1998 to 289 in 2008 and 383 in 2016. Alarm Forest is mostly a bedroom community for Jamestown or Longwood as the only major places of employment in the district are the headquarters of Sure South Atlantic, with its large satellite dishes that connect Saint Helena to the outside world, and the St Helena Distillery. The district lacks a community centre or a school and the population looks to nearby Jamestown or Longwood for shopping and entertainment. History Napoleon resided in the Briars, then in Jamestown, for several months in 1815 before being transferred to Longwood House. He had selected a spot in Sane Valley as his burial site during one of his walks and his tomb was built there after his death in 1821. Napoleon was reburied in 1840 in Les Invalides in Paris. The French government later purchased the site of the tomb and commemorates his death there every year.

Interstitial means space between cells i.e. corneal stroma which lies between the epithelium and the endothelium. Keratitis means corneal inflammation. Signs and symptoms Acutely, early symptoms include a painful, photophobic, red watery eye. This is due to active corneal inflammation resulting in vascular invasion and stromal necrosis which can be diffuse or localized. This causes the pinkish discoloration of what was a clear transparent normal corneal tissue (called Salmon patch of Hutchinson). Such vascularization is likely to result in blurring of vision secondary to corneal stromal scarring, the presence of ghost vessels, and thinning of the cornea, especially if it involves the visual axis. Cause By far the most common cause of IK is syphilitic disease. However, there are two possible causes of the corneal inflammatory response: an infection and/or an immunological response, such as a hypersensitivity type reaction, or (rarely) Cogan syndrome. Infectious causes include syphilis (commonest), followed by other bacterial infections (TB, Leprosy and Lyme disease) and parasitic infections (Acanthamoeba, Onchocerciasis or river blindness, Leishmaniasis, Trypanosoma cruzi or Chagas disease, Trypanosoma brucei or African sleeping sickness and microsporidia)Majmudar PA. \\"Keratitis, Interstitial\\" emedicine Dec 07 Pathophysiology The corneal scarring is the end result of the initial invasion of blood vessels into the corneal stroma as part of the inflammatory response. Since normal corneal tissue should be avascular (no blood vessel) and therefore clear to allow light to pass, the presence of blood vessel and the infiltration of cells as part of the inflammatory process results in scarring or hazing of the cornea.Dr Khairul Nazri Mohammad (Articles' Author), Waterford General Hospital, IRELAND Diagnosis A positive VDRL of Treponema pallidum immobilization test confirms diagnosis of luetic(syphilitic) interstitial keratitis Treatment The underlying cause must be treated as soon as possible to stop the disease process. Corticosteroid drop can be used to minimize the scarring on the cornea along with antibiotic cover. However, residual scarring cannot be avoided which can result in long term visual impairment and corneal transplantation is not suitable due to high rejection rate from the corneal vascularization.Kanski JJ. \\"Clinical Ophthalmology 5th ed\\" History Previous long-standing eye infection which possibly during childhood time recalled as being treated with antibiotic and/or hospitalized over long period of time.

Kscope is an independent record label that is part of Snapper Music, and a sister-label of Peaceville. It is dedicated to artists in the progressive rock genre. The label has released albums by Steven Wilson and his projects Porcupine Tree, No-Man and Blackfield. In 2008 it branched out and has since signed the post-progressive artists Anathema, Lunatic Soul and Ulver, and progressive rock stalwart Ian Anderson to their roster. In 2013, the Steven Wilson release The Raven That Refused To Sing (and Other Stories) received the Album of the Year award at the Progressive Music Awards.  History  Established in the late 1990s, the label was initially used exclusively by Wilson and Porcupine Tree. In this first incarnation, Kscope was featured as an outlet for the 1999 album Stupid Dream, with Snapper Music as the distributor. It was followed by Lightbulb Sun in 2000 and a collection of left-over material Recordings. After the band signed up with Atlantic Records in 2002, the name was used for Wilson's side projects. This included the albums Together We're Stranger (2003) and the re- issue of the Flowermouth (2005) by No-Man. It also released Blackfield (2004) and Blackfield II (2007)—a collaboration with Aviv Geffen. When Snapper Music acquired the earlier Porcupine Tree recordings from Delerium Records in 2006, a re-release programme was rolled out. At the same time, talks began to expand the remit of the label, and Wilson suggested to \\"have [it] for releasing only new music. Just go after some of these [post progressive] bands and model yourselves on those old ’70s labels, like Harvest and Vertigo, [who] would allow artists to develop both musically and with a fan base over a period of albums”. As a result, Snapper music remodeled Kscope to focus on post- progressive music, with Wilson actively involved with the acts that were signed. One of the label's earliest signings was The Pineapple Thief after its frontman Bruce Soord was contacted by Wilson. The first release was the Tightly Unwound album that received the catalogue number 101.Listing for the Tightly Unwound album on Discogs.com, (accessed 26 August 2015). Within two years Kscope built up its roster with Johnny Wilks commenting that by this stage \\"the label had really got going and we were working with Engineers, Gazpacho & Steven Wilson. I really felt we were establishing ourselves as a label\\". At the same time, Kscope continued to release Wilson related material, including Schoolyard Ghosts by No-Man on 12 May 2008. A number of re-releases included the first solo album, Things Buried, by Richard Barbieri in 2007. In 2008 the band Anathema made their debut on the label with album Hindsight, while Lunatic Soul from Poland and the Italian band Nosound were added to the roster. The label packages their albums in elaborate digibooks, super jewelcases or digipacks with additional DVD material. Like the Steven Wilson solo album Insurgentes (2009) that was included a documentary and a DVD-Audio option. Another prominent release was We’re Here Because We’re Here by Anathema. In 2013, the label celebrated its fifth anniversary with two concerts in London, headlined by Amplifier and Anathema. In April 2014 the label released the Homo Erraticus album by Ian Anderson, which reached #14 in the UK album chart. Kscope have a monthly podcast hosted by Billy Reeves, which features new music and interviews from artists on the label.

The 2-groups are part of a larger hierarchy of n-groups. In some of the literature, 2-groups are also called gr-categories or groupal groupoids.  Definition  A 2-group is a monoidal category G in which every morphism is invertible and every object has a weak inverse. (Here, a weak inverse of an object x is an object y such that xy and yx are both isomorphic to the unit object.)  Strict 2-groups  Much of the literature focuses on strict 2-groups. A strict 2-group is a strict monoidal category in which every morphism is invertible and every object has a strict inverse (so that xy and yx are actually equal to the unit object). A strict 2-group is a group object in a category of categories; as such, they are also called groupal categories. Conversely, a strict 2-group is a category object in the category of groups; as such, they are also called categorical groups. They can also be identified with crossed modules, and are most often studied in that form. Thus, 2-groups in general can be seen as a weakening of crossed modules. Every 2-group is equivalent to a strict 2-group, although this can't be done coherently: it doesn't extend to 2-group homomorphisms.  Properties  Weak inverses can always be assigned coherently: one can define a functor on any 2-group G that assigns a weak inverse to each object and makes that object an adjoint equivalence in the monoidal category G. Given a bicategory B and an object x of B, there is an automorphism 2-group of x in B, written AutB(x). The objects are the automorphisms of x, with multiplication given by composition, and the morphisms are the invertible 2-morphisms between these. If B is a 2-groupoid (so all objects and morphisms are weakly invertible) and x is its only object, then AutB(x) is the only data left in B. Thus, 2-groups may be identified with one-object 2-groupoids, much as groups may be identified with one-object groupoids and monoidal categories may be identified with one-object bicategories. If G is a strict 2-group, then the objects of G form a group, called the underlying group of G and written G0. This will not work for arbitrary 2-groups; however, if one identifies isomorphic objects, then the equivalence classes form a group, called the fundamental group of G and written π1(G). (Note that even for a strict 2-group, the fundamental group will only be a quotient group of the underlying group.) As a monoidal category, any 2-group G has a unit object IG. The automorphism group of IG is an abelian group by the Eckmann–Hilton argument, written Aut(IG) or π2(G). The fundamental group of G acts on either side of π2(G), and the associator of G (as a monoidal category) defines an element of the cohomology group H3(π1(G),π2(G)). In fact, 2-groups are classified in this way: given a group π1, an abelian group π2, a group action of π1 on π2, and an element of H3(π1,π2), there is a unique (up to equivalence) 2-group G with π1(G) isomorphic to π1, π2(G) isomorphic to π2, and the other data corresponding. The element of H3(π1,π2) associated to a 2-group is sometimes called its Sinh invariant, as it was developed by Grothendieck's student Hoàng Xuân Sính.  Fundamental 2-group  Given a topological space X and a point x in that space, there is a fundamental 2-group of X at x, written Π2(X,x). As a monoidal category, the objects are loops at x, with multiplication given by concatenation, and the morphisms are basepoint-preserving homotopies between loops, with these morphisms identified if they are themselves homotopic. Conversely, given any 2-group G, one can find a unique (up to weak homotopy equivalence) pointed connected space (X,x) whose fundamental 2-group is G and whose homotopy groups πn are trivial for n > 2. In this way, 2-groups classify pointed connected weak homotopy 2-types. This is a generalisation of the construction of Eilenberg–Mac Lane spaces. If X is a topological space with basepoint x, then the fundamental group of X at x is the same as the fundamental group of the fundamental 2-group of X at x; that is, : pi_{1}(X,x) = pi_{1}(Pi_{2}(X,x)) .! This fact is the origin of the term \\"fundamental\\" in both of its 2-group instances. Similarly, : pi_{2}(X,x) = pi_{2}(Pi_{2}(X,x)) .! Thus, both the first and second homotopy groups of a space are contained within its fundamental 2-group. As this 2-group also defines an action of π1(X,x) on π2(X,x) and an element of the cohomology group H3(π1(X,x),π2(X,x)), this is precisely the data needed to form the Postnikov tower of X if X is a pointed connected homotopy 2-type.

A pioneer in the field of architectural preservation in the United States, he played a leading part in the restoration of Monticello and Stratford Hall Plantation in Virginia. Over his nearly-30-year tenure as director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, he moved the museum into its current building and greatly expanded its collections. Biography Thomas Jefferson's drawing of original front elevation of Monticello. Illustration in Fiske Kimball's Domestic Architecture of the American Colonies and of the Early Republic, 1922 Philadelphia Museum of Art, East Entrance. Kimball was born in Newton, Massachusetts on December 8, 1888. He was educated at Harvard University, where he took both his bachelor's and master's degrees in architecture. Kimball was awarded a Sheldon Fellowship for travel to Europe in 1911 and passed his assistantship in the library to his sister Theodora Kimball Hubbard during his absence. This opportunity propelled his sister's career as the first Landscape Architecture Librarian at Harvard University. He then taught at the University of Illinois and the University of Michigan, receiving a Ph.D from the latter institution in 1915. In 1919, Kimball was appointed to head the newly formed department of art and architecture at the University of Virginia. While at the University of Virginia, he served as the supervising architect for Memorial Gymnasium (built in 1924), and the McIntire Amphitheatre on grounds at the university. He also designed the campus of Woodberry Forest School.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/223512.pdf In 1923, Kimball left the University of Virginia to establish the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University. In 1925, he was appointed director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where he served until his retirement in January 1955. During his first year in Philadelphia, he lived in and restored the Mount Pleasant mansion. Kimball was a consultant on numerous other restoration projects, including Monticello, Gunston Hall, Stratford Hall, and Colonial Williamsburg. Kimball continued to work on projects in Virginia. Kimball designed his own home, Shack Mountain, in Albemarle County, Virginia, not from far Monticello.Fiske Kimball:Shack Mountain, lib.virginia.edu Kimball used Jefferson's architectural principles as the basis of his design of Shack Mountain, short for Shackelford Mountain, the surname of a branch of Jefferson's descendants.

Marriage Kimball married, in June 1913, Marie Christina Goebel (1889–1955), the half Dutch, half German daughter of Julius Goebel, a professor of Germanic languages at the University of Illinois. She eventually was the recipient of two Guggenheim Fellowships and served as Monticello's first curator (1944–55). She also wrote a three-volume biography of Jefferson.

She was a daughter of Valdemar, King of Sweden and Sophia of Denmark, daughter of the King Eric IV.  Life  Her exact date of birth is unknown, but is generally placed as the third daughter and fifth child born of her parents' marriage (at all, they had seven children, two sons and five daughters). She was certainly born before 1273, because by that year she and her sister Katharina were considered for possible marriage with Otto, only son and heir of John, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg.K. Jasiński: Genealogia Piastów wielkopolskich. Potomstwo Władysława Odonica, 1995, p. 55. However, the marriage negotiations ended without results. In 1275, King Valdemar was deposed by his brother Magnus, and a year later his wife Sophia divorced him and returned to Denmark. Apparently, young Richeza and her siblings remained in Sweden probably under the care of their father. Her marriage by proxy with Przemysł II, Duke of Greater Poland, took place in the Swedish city of Nyköping on 11 October 1285. In the same ceremony, Richeza's younger sister Marianne (or Marina), was married to a German nobleman, Count Rudolph II of Diepholz.A. Świeżawski: Przemysł - król Polski, Warsaw 2006, p. 120. Richeza's marriage, concluded through the mediation of the House of Ascania, rulers of Brandenburg, was performed without the consent of her father, ex-King Valdemar. In the proxy marriage the Polish Duke was represented by the notary Tylon, one of his closest subjects.KDW (Kodeks Dyplomatyczny Wielkopolski), vol. I, nr 568. There is no information about when and where the formal marriage took place between Przemysł II and Richeza.K. Jasiński: Szwedzkie małżeństwo księcia wielkopolskiego Przemysła II (Ryksa, żona Przemysła), [in:] Monastycyzm, Słowiańszczyzna i państwo polskie. Warsztat badawczy historyka, edited by K. Bobowskiego, Wrocław 1994, pp. 69-80. Traditionally, Richeza and Przemysł II's marriage is described as happy. Their only child was born on 1 September 1288 in the city of Poznań: a daughter, named Richeza, who later became in Queen consort of Bohemia and Poland as a wife of Wenceslaus II and after his death, of Rudolph III of Habsburg.Rocznik Traski, [in:] MPH, vol. II, p. 852. The news of the birth of her daughter was also the last information about Richeza. She certainly died between 1 September 1288 and before 13 April 1293,O. Balzer: Genealogia Piastów, Kraków 2005, p. 432. most likely between 1289-1292.K. Jasiński: Genealogia Piastów wielkopolskich. Potomstwo Władysława Odonica, 1995, p. 56. The reports of Jan Długosz, who placed her next to her husband in his royal coronation on 26 June 1295, proved to be erroneous. The deep and strong feelings of Przemysł II for Richeza are evidenced in two facts: firstly, he named their daughter after her, and secondly, he mentioned her in a document issued on 19 April 1293 where Przemysł II ceded to the Bishopric of Poznań the village of Kobylniki as payment for a lamp lit eternally at Richeza's tomb, and also expressed his desire to be buried next to her.KDW, t. II, nr 631. Richeza was buried in the Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul in Poznań. After Przemysł II's murder in 1296 and following his wishes, he was buried next to her.

It is the second-most heavily populated district on the island and is located on its northwestern coast. Description Terrain in the district is quite varied with steep ridges and a limited amount of flat ground, as befits the island's volcanic origin. It is mainly rural and lacks any main settlement as there are many small villages dispersed throughout. Its population has fluctuated from 795 in 1998 to 908 in 2008 and 843 in 2016.

The district is named after the Anglican St Paul's Cathedral, which is located there, and also within the district is Plantation House, the Governor's official residence. The island's only secondary school is situated in St Paul's — the Prince Andrew School. History When the Dutch East India Company occupied St Helena in December 1672, they made their first landing attempt at Lemon Valley Bay, but were beaten off with boulders and rocks thrown by the defenders from the heights on the sides of the valley. After the English recaptured it in May 1673, the mouth of the Lemon Valley was quickly fortified to better deter any future attempts. By 1717 the fort there was ruinous and a quarantine station was built further up the valley to house the slaves recently received from Madagascar that had smallpox. The fortification in Lemon Valley were allowed to continue to deteriorate until they were replaced by entirely new buildings 50-odd years later.Denholm, p. 29–32 Francis Plain (16261769307).jpgFrancis Plain Prince Andrew School (16264718467).jpgPrince Andrew School Plantation_House_(16431883766).jpgPlantation House View of the sea from Plantation House.jpgview from Plantation House St Paul's Anglican Cathedral (16468521732).jpgSaint Paul's Cathedral Boer Prisoner of War Cemetery in Knollcombes Saint Helena.jpgBoer Prisoner of War Cemetery in Knollcombes from below Farm near Rosemary Plain, Saint Paul's.jpgnear Rosemary Plain View of the old guardhouse at Lemon Valley Bay.jpgguardhouse at Lemon Valley Bay Lemon Valley from the sea.jpgLemon Valley from the sea Old quarantine building in Lemon Valley back view.jpgruins of the old quarantine station NotesBibliography * Districts of Saint Helena Populated places in Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha ","title":"Saint Paul's, Saint Helena"},{"id":"21368509","text":"Jeremiah Francis Donovan (September 3, 1876 - June 27, 1938) was a Major League Baseball catcher.

The first wooden church was built in 1461. The second, also made of wood, was built in 1530 and then renovated in 1567. The masonry church was built between 1614 and 1615 and financed by Wilhelm Duke. The fifth church in Saldus was built in 1737 on the hill where the present church stands. It was reconstructed in 1825. In 1898 the old church was torn down. Architect Wilhelm Neumann designed the church. Construction took place from 1898 to 1899 and cost 19,700 rubles. The completed church was named in honor of St. John. (Wilhelm Neumann also designed the Latvian National Museum of Art and the Jaunsvente Manor.) The church was reconstructed in 1938 for a sum of 15,000 lats. The artist Ansis Bērziņš led the renovation of the interior and furnishings. The retreating German army bombed the church tower in 1944. The roof was also damaged. A temporary wooden tower was built in 1945–1946. Demolition of the temporary tower began on June 13, 1981, and the construction of the new tower began ten days later. Saldus architect Edgars Krūmiņš designed the tower and V. Krivans made the rooster at the top of the spire. The renovated church was dedicated on August 1, 1982. The underground tombs were opened and researched during a renovation in 1995, when heated flooring was installed. The church facade was renovated in 2006.

He previously served three terms in the Florida House of Representatives, from 2008 to 2010 and again from 2012 until his election to the Senate in 2016. Early life and education Rader was born in Detroit, Michigan, and moved to Florida in 1972, where he graduated from Lake Brantley High School in Altamonte Springs in 1986. After high school, he attended Boston University, graduating with his bachelor's degree in 1990.  Career =Florida House of Representatives In 2000, when incumbent State Representative Debby Sanderson ran for a seat in the Florida Senate rather than seeking re- election, an open seat was created in the 91st District, based in Broward County and Palm Beach County. Rader won the Democratic primary and advanced to the general election, where he faced Connie Mack IV, the Republican nominee and the son of retiring United States Senator Connie Mack III. The Sun- Sentinel criticized both candidates, opining that, regardless of the victor, the district would be represented by a \\"young, inexperienced representative.\\" Despite this, however, the paper endorsed Mack, hoping that Republicans in the legislature would \\"make sure Mack learns legislative procedure and help the son of the senator become a competent state representative.\\" Mack ended up defeating Rader by a wide margin, with Rader only receiving 44% of the vote to his opponent's 56%. Rader experienced more success, however, when State Representative Richard A. Machek was unable to seek another term in 2008, and retired; Rader ran to succeed him in the 78th District, which was based in northern Broward County, western Martin County, eastern Okeechobee County, western Palm Beach County, and central St. Lucie County. In the Democratic primary, Rader faced Steve Perman and Steve Nichol, whom he was narrowly able to defeat, winning 38% of the vote to Perman's 36% and Nichol's 26%. He advanced to the general election, where he was elected to his first term unopposed. Florida Senate candidacy When State Senator Dave Aronberg declined to seek another term in the legislature to instead run for attorney general in 2010, Rader ran to succeed him in the 27th District, which stretched from Boynton Beach to Cape Coral and included parts of Charlotte County, Glades County, Lee County, and Palm Beach County. In the Democratic primary, Rader faced retired lawyer and 2008 legislature candidate Peter Burkert. During the campaign, The Palm Beach Post endorsed Burkert and strongly criticized Rader for his co-sponsorship of \\"one of the worst insurance giveaway bills, the so-called 'State Farm Bill' that would have allowed the state's 15 largest property insurers to charge basically whatever they wanted.\\" Rader defeated Burkert by a slim margin, winning 53% of the vote to Burkert's 47% and advancing to the general election, where he faced former Wellington Village Councilwoman Lizbeth Benacquisto, the Republican nominee. During the election, Rader accused Benacquisto of committing 105 election law violations, which Politifact rated as a true statement, and of supporting making abortion illegal in all cases, \\"including rape, incest, even to save a woman's life,\\" which Politifact rated as \\"mostly true.\\" Benacquisto condemned Rader's attack, revealing that she had been raped while she was in college and that his attacks \\"really crossed the line,\\" while still maintaining her opposition to abortion. Benacquisto ultimately defeated Rader, winning 54% of the vote to his 46%. Return to the Florida House In 2012, when the state legislative districts were reconfigured, Rader opted to run for a second nonconsecutive term in the 81st District, which contained much of the territory that he had previously represented in Palm Beach County. He faced Steve Perman, his successor as State Representative in the 78th District, in the Democratic primary. During the course of the campaign, the business community split in its support for the candidates, with Rader scoring the endorsement of the Florida Chamber of Commerce and Perman gaining the support of the Associated Industries of Florida. Rader defeated Perman by a wide margin, winning 57% of the vote to Perman's 43%, and advancing to the general election, where he faced James O'Hara, the Republican nominee. Throughout the 2013 Legislative Session, Rader served on five committees, Health Quality Subcommittee, Insurance and Banking Subcommittee, State Affairs Committee, Agriculture and Natural Resources Subcommittee (Democratic Ranking Member), and the Healthy Families Subcommittee.http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Representatives/details.aspx?MemberId=4431&LegislativeTermId;=85  Florida Senate  In 2016, Rader ran for the Florida Senate seat vacated by Joseph Abruzzo, who opted to run for Rader's House seat instead of re- election in his reconfigured Senate district. Rader defeated teacher Mindy Koch in the Democratic primary with 58.5% of the vote. He won the general election without opposition.

This is achieved using a combination of decorating nails with coloured varnish, transfers, gems or glitter. Basic treatments include manicures and pedicures, as well as cleaning and filing nails and applying overlays or extensions. Nail technicians can also paint designs onto nails with an airbrush, by hand, using a stencil or stamping. A nail technician will often complete a consultation with the client to check for any signs of skin problems, deformities or nail disease before treatment and give clients advice about looking after their hands and nails, and recommend nail care products. Training to become a nail technician involves doing a professional course that normally takes at least a year to complete. Courses will more than likely cover anatomy and physiology of the nails, hands, arms, feet and legs, contraindications that may arise, identifying diseases and disorders, proper sanitation and sterilizing techniques, how to perform nail services safely, gel polish application, liquid and powder enhancements and hard gel enhancements. The work itself tends to take place in a beauty salon although some nail technicians will make house calls to clients. Once licensed, many nail technicians will keep their own regular client list.The basic equipment needed to carry out Nail services can be easily obtained.

The episode was written by Sheila Lawrence and directed by Bethany Rooney. Plot At a YETI class, Betty is advised to get experience in an industry other than fashion if that's not her ultimate career goal. Betty suggests that each editor-in-training pair up with someone who works at a different magazine to gain more experience. She asks Daniel if he has any non-fashion-related assignments for her and he hands her the job of writing press release about a new designer named Heinrich, who's been added to the Mode show at the last minute. For her YETI partner, Betty selects the girl from the New York Review but Jodie pairs her with Matt, the \\"sports guy.\\" He has to trail her during Fashion Week, including a visit to the enigmatic Heinrich. She doesn't know what to make of his designs of metal, glass, barbed wire and wings! Wilhelmina is outraged when a Cavalli dress she'd been planning on wearing does not arrive, and even more so when Marc suggests it's because she's \\"fallen off the radar\\" due to all the time she's spending with Connor. Things get even worse when she's seated in the second row at a fashion show, instead of her usual front-row seat. To prove that she still has the power to decide what's in and what's out, she grants an exclusive interview to Suzuki St. Pierre, but gets bumped in favor of a news update about the latest in doggie denim trends. Wilhelmina laments to Connor that she thought she could have a personal life as well as a career and he advises her to \\"claw her way back.\\" Molly dresses up to accompany Daniel to Fashion Week, but is labeled a \\"frump\\" in the press, so Daniel arranges for her to get her hair and makeup done by two Mode stylists. When Suzuki greets her as \\"Ugly Ducking\\" and wants to know all about her makeover, Molly turns away. After receiving a phone call, she claims there's a leak at her building and leaves. Hilda throws Elena a going-away party since Ignacio no longer needs a nurse. \\"Once the kinky Florence Nightingale bit is over, it's done,\\" she tells Betty, but Betty's not so sure it's the end of Ignacio's romance. Betty is proven right when Elena comes down to breakfast the next morning with Ignacio, dressed in his robe. Hilda is put off when Ignacio and Elena make out while she's trying to watch TV. Ignacio insists he has a right to have a relationship and Hilda replies she has a right not to have that shoved in her face. \\"This is my house too,\\" she yells. Justin tells her he likes Elena and remembers that she and Hilda used to be friends. Betty and Christina write a jokey press release for Heinrich, one that advises fashion fans to \\"get their tetanus shot,\\" but it ends up being sent out by mistake. Daniel is pleased with the unconventional approach, however, as is Heinrich, who now wants Betty to produce his show. Daniel tells Betty to simply follow Heinrich's vision, but she has no idea what to do with his vague, contradictory descriptions. Because the buzz is so high, Daniel tells her they're moving the Heinrich show to the prestigious final spot. Betty asks him to assign someone else, but Daniel assures her that she's going to do a great job. Betty is contemptuous of Matt's offer to take a break from all things fashion by visiting his magazine. He tells her she's prejudged him as 'the sports guy.\\" \\"I know you think fashion is shallow, but it seems to me that you fit right in,\\" he says and leaves. She runs after him and tells him she'd love to accompany him on a sports assignment. He tries to warn her but she won't take no for an answer, and finds herself in the men's locker room. Matt admits that he wasn't a sports fan until he got to know the athletes personally, like the Serbian player who plays to support his poor family. \\"None of this was a natural fit for me,\\" he tells her, \\"But I found my way in by making it personal,\\" and suggests that might work for her at Mode. Betty takes his advice to heart and researches how Heinrich grew up behind the Berlin Wall and how his father was killed trying to escape. She finally has a concept: The runway will be flanked by an \\"Iron Curtain,\\" and Heinrich is pleased with her \\"perfect\\" interpretation of his vision. Daniel wonders why Molly hasn't been returning his phone calls and when he tells Betty about the makeover, she points out, \\"You basically told her you're not okay with the way she is.\\" Over the phone, Daniel apologizes to Molly, saying that he loves her and doesn't want her to change. He asks how the repairs to her apartment are going and she tearfully answers, \\"It's more serious than they thought,\\" but she's not at home, she's at the doctor's office. Justin has been dying to attend Fashion Week, but, he gives his ticket to Elena, so that she and Hilda will be forced to spend the evening together. The two women end up giggling over the ridiculous Heinrich fashions and bond over their love of stirrup pants and chunky jewelry. Hilda admits that she likes Elena, she's just uncomfortable with the dating situation. Elena suggests they come up with some \\"ground rules,\\" like less PDA. \\"I think I finally get it,\\" Betty tells Christina backstage at the Heinrich's show. \\"Fashion is art. It's not shallow. It's courageous. It's beautiful.\\" Christina has her own revelation: She's in labor! And the Iron Curtain is blocking the two back exits, so Betty has no choice but to escort Christina down the runway; Christina collapses right on the runway saying, \\"I'm going to have the baby here!\\" Christina can't get out and the paramedics can't get in, due to the crowds. '\\"It's a fashion disaster,\\" cries Marc, but Wilhelmina sees it as her opportunity to get back on top. She orders the models to raise their wings to shield Christina and give her some privacy. Wilhelmina calls for a doctor and Hilda volunteers \\"my father's girlfriend,\\" Elena. The birth becomes the event of fashion week and Wilhelmina emerges triumphantly holding the baby as the show's grand finale. Matt congratulates Betty on the show and she thanks him for encouraging her to \\"dig deeper.\\" He confesses he was never interested in fashion, \\"I was more interested in learning about you.\\" Betty asks Daniel what it feels like to have a half-brother. \\"It makes me miss my dad,\\" he says, and praises her work on Heinrich's show and her ability to connect with people. \\"You'll make a great editor someday,\\" he tells her. Production This episode marks the birth of Wilhelmina Slater and Bradford Meade's son, the future owner of 50% of Meade Publications. This also marks the second time in the series run, following \\"Zero Worship\\", that Betty and Daniel exit the catwalk together as the spotlights are shut off at the end of the episode.

Rajagopalachari. The song set in Carnatic music was written in gratitude to Hindu God (Venkateswara and Krishna visualised as one) and compassionate mother. Kurai Onrum Illai is one of the few songs written by Indian politician, freedom-fighter and Governor-General of India, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari. According to Gopalkrishna Gandhi the song is a euphemism for the bhakti of untouchables (also known as Adi Dravidars or Harijans or Panchama).http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mag/2002/12/22/stories/2002122200220100.htm The song was sung by M. S. Subbulakshmi in the Sri Venkateswara (Balaji) Pancharatna Mala LP-2 (Long Play Record) (1979/80). This song is unique because it does not assume the tone of devoted prayer as most Hindu devotional songs but one of thankfulness to God. The song comprises 3 stanzas each set in three different ragas. Kurai Onrum Illai is a very popular song in South India and is a regular in most Carnatic concerts. It became very famous after it was sung by M. S. Subbulakshmi.  History  Rajagopalachari, or Rajaji as he was popularly known, was a religious Hindu and a devout Vaishnavite. Apart from his illustrious political career, he is also known to have authored books on history, religion, politics and Hindu mythology. His translations of the Ramayana and Mahabharata are considered classics and are used by American universities as a part of their syllabus on \\"Oriental Studies\\". However, Rajaji is not a popular composer of Carnatic music and \\"Kurai Onrum Illai\\" is his sole Carnatic composition (with some help from Tamil scholar M.P.Somasundaram ( மீ.ப.சோமு) ) that has gained widespread recognition. The song depicts his intense devotion to God. The composition was published in the Tamil magazine Kalki in 1967. The song became popular after it was sung as one of the pieces in the Long Play Record set, known as Sri Venkateswara (Balaji) Pancharatnamala by M. S. Subbulakshmi in 1979/80. Since then, the song has been widely appreciated and sung in most Carnatic concerts. Explanation and interpretation This composition by Rajaji is one of its kind, in the sense that the author does not elicit any favour from God but only maintains that he has no regrets or dissatisfaction about anything in life. In this song, he regards both Lord Vishnu or Venkateswara of Tirupathi and his incarnation Lord Krishna to be one and the same and uses the names interchangeably. Rajaji's grandson Gopal Gandhi believes that there were multiple factors that led to the composition. He also suspects the presence of hidden meanings in the song. He believes that the song had been inspired by an incident which took place in the shrine of Tiruchanoor in 1925, when Rajaji had defended the right of an untouchable to enter the shrine of Tiruchanoor. Gopal Gandhi believes that Rajaji compares the untouchable's inability to have a glimpse of his favorite God to his own inability to have a glimpse of the invisible creator. Popular culture The same song was reused with slightly modified lyrics and instrumentation by Vidyasagar for the film Arai En 305-il Kadavul (2008).http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-music-reviews/review-1/arai-music- review.html The song was used with telling effect in Mudal Mudal Mudal Varai (M3V) an International Award Winning Tamil film by Krishnan Seshadri Gomatam. Music was composed by Aslam Mustafa and the song sung by Ms. Jaya.  Notes  External links  * Transliteration of the song from Carnatic song lyrics website karnatik.com * YouTube video of M. S.

Career She debuted as a poet in the 1780s, when she aroused attention by some poems, published in the literary papers of the day. Her breakthrough came by the publication of Erotiska sånger (Erotic songs) in 1799. Her poetry was described as very affected by the Gustavian age. Her collected work was published by Carl Julius Lénström in 1840. This was a success, and was reprinted many times. The same year, she was awarded the Grand gold medal of the Royal Swedish Academy. Widstrom was very well known and admired by her contemporaries and artists, such as Carl Gustaf af Leopold, Bengt Lidner, Thomas Thorild and Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom.

History The International Charles Babbage Society was founded in 1978 and operated out of Palo Alto, California. The following year the American Federation of Information Processing Societies (AFIPS) became a principal sponsor of the Society, which was renamed the Charles Babbage Institute. In 1980, the Institute moved to the University of Minnesota, which contracted with the principals of the Charles Babbage Institute to sponsor and house the Institute. A new entity, the Charles Babbage Foundation, was created to help support and govern the Institute, in partnership with the University. In 1989, CBI became an organized research unit of the University. Around 2000, CBF broadened its mission to support the history of information technology through other organizations, collaborating, for example, with the Sloan Foundation, Software History Center, and the Computer History Museum in experimenting with Internet-based archival and historical research. In 2002, the Charles Babbage Foundation broadened its mission to support the entire IT history community.

It is a national architecture monument included in the list of the culture monuments under state protection. The oldest county administrative documents relating to the subsequent estate are no longer found in publications or extracts from the Baltic German historians archives. History The palace has its roots in a time when the Aizpute and Sakaslejas county belonged to the bishopric of Courland. It was built in 1752 as a hunting palace for the German Baltic baron family von Manteuffel-Szoeges. It was an unimpressive, simple building. In 1868 the palace was rebuilt and expanded in the Tudor-Neo-Gothic style by the project of Teodor Zeiler. Interior elements in the palace are partly preserved, there are ornamental plafonds in some rooms and hearth with marble decorations dating back to beginning of nineteenth century. After this reconstruction, the palace became a quite impressive building with very individual forms and look. On 16 December 1730 the king confirmed that Otto Friedrich von Behr and his wife Katharina, and their descendants, were the owners of the old Cīrava manor. On 10 August 1774 King Stanisław August Poniatowski confirmed Herman Friedrich von Behr and his wife Elizabeth, and their descendants, as the new owners of the estate. In October 1781 the property was inherited by Šarlote Katarīna, and in the summer of 1781 it was acquired by Karl Gothard Ernst von Manteuffel-Szoeges, landlord of Kazdanga Palace. In the spring of 1921, in accordance with Latvian Agrarian Reform Law of 1920, the estate was nationalized and became part of the Latvian state, which took hold of the manor, some 700 ha. of arable land and 150 ha. of grasslands. From 1922 until 1951 the technical school of forestry (Meža skola) was housed in the palace. Later it served as technical school of agriculture. The last few decades the palace has stood empty and needs renovation jobs. There are some plans to renovate it and transform it to a hotel. Surroundings The palace is surrounded by a nineteenth-century landscape park. There is also a decorative pond with two islands and a big collection of trees and bushes in the park. G. Kuffalt, the main gardener of Riga, took part in the creation of the Cīrava Palace park.

Compared to the history of logic, the demarcation between philosophy of logic and philosophical logic is of recent coinage and not always entirely clear. Characterisations include: * Philosophy of logic is the area of philosophy devoted to examining the scope and nature of logic. * Philosophy of logic is the investigation, critical analysis and intellectual reflection on issues arising in logic. The field is considered to be distinct from philosophical logic. * Philosophical logic is the branch of study that concerns questions about reference, predication, identity, truth, quantification, existence, entailment, modality, and necessity.Lowe, E. J.. Forms of Thought: A Study in Philosophical Logic. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2013. * Philosophical logic is the application of formal logical techniques to philosophical problems.Russell, Gillian Thoughts, Arguments, and Rants, Jc's Column. This article outlines issues in philosophy of logic or provides links to relevant articles or both. Introduction This article makes use of the following terms and concepts: * Type–token distinction * Use–mention distinction Truth Aristotle said To say that that which is, is not or that which is not is, is a falsehood; and to say that which is, is and that which is not is not, is trueAristotle, Metaphysics,Books Γ, Δ, Ε 2nd edition 1011b25 (1993) trans Kirwan,: OUP This apparent truism has not proved unproblematic. Truthbearers Logic uses such terms as true, false, inconsistent, valid, and self-contradictory. Questions arise as Strawson (1952) writes : > (a) when we use these words of logical appraisal, what is it exactly that we > are appraising? and (b) how does logical appraisal become possible? :See also: Sentence, Statement, Proposition.

The concept of logical truth is intimately linked with those of validity, logical consequence and entailment (as well as self-contradiction, necessarily false etc.). * If q is a logical truth, then p therefore q will be a valid argument. * If p1, p2, p3 ... pn therefore q is a valid argument then its corresponding conditional will be a logical truth. * If p1 & p2 & p3 ... pn entails q then If (p1 & p2 & p3 ... pn) then q is a logical truth. * If q is a logical consequence of p1 & p2 & p3 ... pn if and only if p1 & p2 & p3 ... pn entails q and if and only if If (p1 & p2 & p3..pn) then q is a logical truth Issues that arise include: * If there are truths that must be true, what makes them so? * Are there analytic truths that are not logical truths? * Are there necessary truths that are not analytic truths? * Are there necessary truths that are not logical truths? * Is the distinction between analytic truth and synthetic truth spurious?
