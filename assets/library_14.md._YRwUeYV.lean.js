She was known for her activities in marine biology and conservation, particularly as it applies to marine molluscs and mammals. Turk became a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 2002, and was awarded the Stamford Raffles Award by the Zoological Society of London in 1979. History Stella Turk was born in 1925 in the Isles of Scilly, some distance off the western tip of Cornwall, Great Britain. She was born Stella Maris Treharne; her first two names, \\"Stella Maris\\", are a Latin phrase meaning \\"star of the sea\\", a title sometimes given to the Virgin Mary. Although Turk lived in New Zealand as a small child, she primarily grew up in Cornwall, and has spent most of her life living in and researching in that county. Turk is a working scientist and a published zoologist. In addition she worked with her late husband biologist Frank Turk in the field of adult education. Stella Turk and Frank Turk founded the \\"Cornish Biological Record Unit\\" at the University of Exeter's, Institute of Cornish Studies. This was later incorporated into the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. Turk served as the British Isles National Recorder for marine molluscs for the Conchological Society of Great Britain & Ireland, as well as the Strandings Recorder (i.e. strandings of marine mammals, other marine vertebrates, and in fact any unusual organisms) for the Cornish Biological Records Unit. She was a major contributor to the Red Data Book for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly (editor Adrian Spalding), as the author of thirty-six sections including many of the unusual and under-recorded animals such as Thorn-skins (Kinorhyncha) and Entoprocta. For many years, she wrote a nature column in the West Briton. In 1979, Turk was awarded the Stamford Raffles Award by the Zoological Society of London \\"For contributions to the study of seahorse life and marine molluscs\\". In 1980 Turk was awarded an honorary Master of Science (MSc) from the University of Exeter. Turk was awarded an MBE in the 2003 New Year Honours List, \\"For services to Nature Conservation, Cornwall, while holding office as Strandings Recorder\\".

An understanding of these roles is evident in children as young as age 4Gender Identity and Gender Confusion in Children. (11 May 2013). HealthyChildren.org.

Gender roles are influenced by the media, family, environment, and society. A child's understanding of gender roles impacts how they socialize with their peers and form relationships. Many children have a firm sense of their gender identity, while some children can experience gender identity along a continuum. In addition to biological maturation, children develop within a set of gender- specific social and behavioral norms embedded in family structure, natural play patterns, close friendships, and the teeming social jungle of school life. The gender roles encountered in childhood play a large part in shaping an individual's self-concept and influence the way an individual forms relationships later on in life.Beal, C. (1994). Boys and girls: The development of gender roles. New York: McGraw-Hill. Parental influences Expectations for children's future adult lives, like financial success or future care giving, may lead parents to encourage certain behaviors in children. However, most parental behaviors remain uninfluenced by the gender of the child, including speaking to, playing, teaching, and caretaking. Family dynamics can especially influence gender specialization. Parents of sons are more likely to express conservative gender role views than parents of daughters, with fathers emphasizing the paternal breadwinning role for males. The effects of parental expectations of gender roles can especially be seen in the role children play in household duties. Girls generally do more housework than boys and the type of housework assigned to children largely depends on gender. Thus, household dynamics further advance gender role expectations on children. Children's toy preferences are significantly related to parental sex-typing, such as girls playing with dolls and boys participating in sports. While both fathers and mothers encourage traditional gender roles in their children, fathers tend to encourage these roles more frequently than mothers. Parents choose activities that they believe their children will enjoy and value. By choosing their children's activities, parents are directly influencing their gender role views and preferences onto their children and shaping expectations. Hines & Kaufman (1994) examined the toy preferences and behavior in girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a condition characterized by exposure to high levels of androgens in utero. The results suggested that CAH girls exhibited more masculine-typed behavior observable through toy choice as well as drawings and rough-and-tumble play. While a compelling result, parental expectations, in addition to biology, could play a large role in shaping behavioral outcomes. An early diagnosis might lead parents to expect, and therefore, condone, more masculine-typed behaviors, implicitly socializing the CAH girls to express themselves in certain ways. In normally developing girls, masculine behaviors may be discouraged, and parents may steer their daughters toward more traditionally feminine toys, colors, and preferences. This alternative social explanation complicates the interpretation of neat causality between hormones and behavior. The way that parents communicate with their children are different based on children’s gender, parents are more willing to express their emotion and use emotional words more frequently toward girls than to boys. Also, when both children have encountered difficulty, girls are encouraged to solve problems based on focusing on internal emotion expression and adjustment while boys are encouraged to deal with external entity problems. For boys whose father discloses emotions more than the others, boys show a similar level of disclosing emotions with girls, and for the parent who is both emotional expressive, their son will view emotions disclosure as a normal practice rather than attributed it as a female way of acting. According to attachment theory, the early experience and interaction an infant has with his/her caregiver(s) determined whether the infant is securely attached with the caregiver(s), different attachment styles have different influences on one psychological and interpersonal-relationship development. Research found that among college men, people who are securely attached are less likely to suppress their emotions but feel more comfortable expressing it. Besides secure attachment, three other attachment styles are more likely to value success, power, control, and competition that are considered as traditionally masculine traits, in order to make up the lacking sense of security. Patterns of play In early childhood, gender roles become apparent in patterns of play. Until 1983, these play differences were ignored in studies of the differences between boys and girls,Calvert, S. L. (2013, November 6). Gender Roles [PowerPoint presentation]. but recent research has shed light on these sex differences. Hardy et al (2009). addresses the differences among preschool boys and girls in their development of fundamental movements. This time period is especially crucial because if a child's fundamental movement skills do not develop properly, then their future development will be drastically impacted. This study took 425 preschool children and asked them to perform specific fundamental movement skills such as locomotor and object control skills. After examining the children performing these movements, the researchers found that female preschoolers are generally better at locomotor movements, while male preschoolers are better at object control. These findings emphasize the need for a superior program in which boys and girls can work together and integrate their skills for a chance at greater development of future skills. One of the earliest signs of gender differences in play patterns is the appearance of gender-segregated play groups and toy preferences. Boys tend to be more \\"rough and tumble\\" in their play while girls shy away from this aggressive behavior, leading to the formation of separate play groups. In addition, boys tend to gravitate more towards toys such as trucks while girls tend to gravitate towards dolls, but these preferences are not absolutes. A study by Alexander, Wilcox, and Woods showed that female infants showed more visual interest in a doll over a toy truck while male infants showed more visual interest in a toy truck over a doll, but these differences were more pronounced in the females. This study suggests that preferences for feminine or masculine toys precede any sex differences in the perceptual features of such toys, leading to the assumption that gender-based toy preference is innate. One of the most compelling theories in regards to biologically determined gender differences is the idea that male-preference and female-preference for toys are mediated by inequities in visual processing. The central claim is that males and females are preprogrammed to specialize in certain forms of perception: specifically, perception of motion and perception of form and color, respectively. Alexander (2003) makes a particularly strong case. The author suggests that inherent sex differences based on perceptual categories encourage children to seek out playmates of a similar play style, and ultimately predisposes them for later social and gender roles (Alexander, 2003). Human vision operates based on two anatomically grounded systems: the magnocellular pathway (M-cell) and the parvocellular pathway (P-cell). Both pathways are present in males and females, and M-cells are designed to recognize motion, while P-cells specialize in form and color perception (Alexander, 2003). Some research has suggested that sex-linked differences in M-cell versus P-cell dominance could be the underlying factor leading to differential toy preference in children, potentially validating the stereotype that boys prefer toy cars and balls (objects associated with motion) while girls prefer dolls and stuffed animals (objects characterized by distinct facial characteristics, form, and color). Beyond hormonal explanations, Alexander (2003) also employs an evolutionary biology perspective to link contemporary toy preference to early selective pressures and the development of visual specialization. Specifically, male M-cell pathway dominance is connected back to motion mediated activities like hunting and the throwing of projectiles. Female P-cell dominance is tied to foraging for plants, a task requiring discrimination between colors and memory of form. Color is particularly important in foraging, as discrimination between colors aids in identifying a ripe piece of fruit from the greenery around it. As it were, the \\"green-red opponent system\\" is thought to be X-chromosome linked and phylogenetically more recent, in contrast with the more rudimentary \\"yellow-blue\\" system present to the same degree in both sexes (Alexander, 2003). According to the theory, this adaptation has persisted throughout human evolution, and may contribute to contemporary sexual- dimorphism in skill and preference. From this position, Alexander (2003) suggests the designation of pink as a girl color and blue as a boy color might not be completely arbitrary after all. In a separate study by Gredlin and Bjorklund (2005), it was found that there are sex differences in object manipulation. An experiment was performed by putting a desirable toy in an out-of-reach place but also giving the child 5 different tools he/she could use to help retrieve this object. The children were put in these conditions and any decision they made was spontaneous and on their own; they were only given a hint after they had failed the task 5 times. The study's results showed that 77% of the boys used one of the tools to reach the toy, while only 31% of the girls used one of the tools. This shows that boys are more likely to participate in object manipulation, and this may be because they spend more time in object-oriented play. The study also found that girls spend more time in social play. Evolution may play a role in this phenomenon; the differences in play styles between boys and girls manifest into adult behavior. Another study by Alexander and Saenz found that two-year-old girls preferred toys that were typically associated with females over those associated with males, but again, two-year-old boys showed only a small preference for masculine toys over feminine toys. These two studies support the notion that toy preferences, while gender-based, are not a perfect indication of gender identity. Further, a study by Jadva, Hines, and Golombok showed that while male and female infants show more visual attention towards toys specific to their gender, there is no significant sex difference in color or shape preference at a young age, which suggests that, for example, a preference for the color pink in girls stems more from societal norms than from an innate capacity. Play differences are not concrete, as mentioned, as some play with \\"other-gendered\\" toys is quite common. Ruble and Martin showed that there is often cross- gendered play in boys and girls, and this is typical of development. However, it is hypothesized that atypical gendered play patterns, such as a boy who plays almost exclusively with dolls and not typical masculine toys and who prefers to play with girls over boys, are an indication of later homosexuality. In one study by Eric W. Lindsey and Jacquelyn Mize, context can have a big effect on the types of activities children will partake in. For example, this article outlines that if parents associate certain household tasks with gender unintentionally, the child can get an idea that certain things are \\"masculine\\" and \\"feminine.\\" This is illustrated in the article by an example of a father doing yardwork with his son instead of interior housework; this inherently gives the son the idea that these tasks are more \\"manly\\" and is the man's role to do in the house. This can effect gender roles in childhood. Lobel & Menashri (1993) explores how the rigidity of gender schemas guides behavior. The population of interest consisted of preschool children selected from three different preschools in Tel-Aviv, Israel, and the study focused on the relationship between the children's gender-typed toy choice, their frameworks regarding cross-gender behavior, and their concepts of gender constancy. During the procedure, two feminine and two masculine toys were presented to individual children: a visibly new doll, a tattered, old doll, a shiny new truck, and an old, faded truck. Based on a pretest, the dolls and trucks were clearly recognized as feminine and masculine, as well as attractive and unattractive based on their quality. All children preferred the new toy when presented with a pair of singularly gendered toys. Children were first given a toy preference test, then a gender constancy interview, and then a gender-role norms interview. The results indicate that children with a more flexible view on gender-role norms made fewer gender-typed choices than children with rigid norms. Similarly, for children with more flexible gender norms, attractiveness of the toy proved to be more strongly related to preference than the toy's adherence to a traditional gender-role. This result begs the question: from where does this flexibility in gender behavior come? The authors favor the explanation that parental norms play a large role, but insist that further research must be done. Echoing Serbin et al. (2001), they also assert that a certain level of cognitive ability must be reached in order to demonstrate flexibility in gender roles, otherwise conceptions of fundamental gender constancy could become confused with external objects associated with a traditional gender role. Besides play patterns being an indication of sexual orientation, the presence of homosexual or heterosexual relationships in the family may in turn influence play patterns in children. It has been suggested that children of same-sex couples are raised differently, resulting in gender roles different from those of heterosexual parents. This viewpoint is validated in a recent study by Goldberg, Kashy, and Smith, which showed that sons of lesbian mothers were less masculine in the way in which they played than those of gay fathers or heterosexual parents. While this study supports one viewpoint on the effects of same-sex parenting, further research is required to validate the long-term consequences of homosexual parenting. In a 2015 study, it was found that children over the age of two show a stronger preference for the color of an object, as opposed to what the object was. The child was more interested in toys that were gender- traditionally colored, regardless if that toy was a toy typical for their gender. Due to the separation of toys advertised, or colored, for certain genders, it can hinder cognitive and social skills. Boy oriented toys focus on spatial skills, and girl oriented toys focus on social or verbal skills. In solitary play, both girls and boys are more likely to play with gender typical toys, but as found by Signorella (2012), but in group play, gender neutral activities were more likely. Friendships Gender roles can also be seen in friendships and peer interactions at a young age. Studies have found that boys and girls interact with same-sex peers more frequently than with opposite-sex peers. One study found that during early childhood (3-5-year olds) boys affiliate more than girls with a familiar same-sex peer and that boys visited the peer more often than girls did and more boys than girls spent a significant amount of time with the peer. A different study found boys and girls were found to engage in highly similar frequencies of dyadic interaction. However, girls engaged in more extended dyadic interaction and boys in greater number of episodes. This study found this to be true at both 4 and 6 years, indicating that sex differences in patterns of dyadic interaction emerge before 5 years. In terms of group activity, boys were found to engage in more coordinated group activity after 5 years of age than before. This study provides evidence that groups interaction emerges at a specific time period in male peer culture. Studies with preschool children yield large effects indicating that boys have more integrated social networks than girls in that their friends or playmates are more likely to be friends or playmates with one another. Likewise, a particular study looking at friendship patterns of youth in middle childhood and early adolescence at summer camp found a large effect for social network density favoring boys toward the end of summer camp, suggesting that over time, friends of boys but not girls are increasingly likely to become friends with one another. In terms of behavioral patterns seen in friendships, no differences have been found in helping behavior in youngest middle childhood youth. Looking at the content of peer interaction, middle childhood youth girls have been found to spend more time in social conversation and self-disclosure than boys. Girls have also been found to respond in a more prosocial manner to hypothetical conflict situations in middle childhood and early adolescence. Studies of middle childhood typically reveal significant effects indicating that girls are more likely than boys to receive several types of provisions in their friendships, including higher levels of closeness, affection, nurturance, trust, validation, and acceptance. However, no differences have been found for friendship satisfaction. A study looked at dyadic friendships, which is believed to be the preferred form of relationship for girls, and found that bonds between males are more durable than those between females. This study reports that beginning as early as 6 years old, external observers report fewer males' than females' same-sex friendships had ended. School By the time children are entering preschool or kindergarten, they have a general understanding of the two genders and have internalized some basic schemas regarding the roles and appearances of each. These schemas have been mostly furnished by parental interaction, media exposure, and underlying biological factors (e.g. inherent aggressiveness, sexual orientation), though some children may also learn from limited social interaction with individuals outside the family. However, these early conceptions of gender roles undergo radical change when the child enters school. Here, the child will encounter a wide variety of approaches to gender, assimilating new information into their existing structures and accommodating their own outlook to fit new individuals, institutional demands, and novel social situations. This process of socialization is differentiated between gender, and general trends in the social constructs of elementary age children reflect the organization of gender within the family and society at large. One way of evaluating gender roles in school children is to dissect the popularity hierarchies that they construct and inhabit. Many studies have done just this, and significant differences are evident between genders. Athletic prowess is by far the most significant factor in popularity among boys, and one study even reported that the most popular male at each school they observed was the best athlete. Those who are not athletically inclined can still attain moderate levels of popularity by merely adopting an interest in sports, while boys who are neither athletically inclined nor interested in sports are commonly harassed and victimized by their more popular peers. This might be seen as an extension of the rough and aggressive play that boys seek at a young age. Boys can also become popular by wearing \\"cool\\" clothes and possessing trendy gadgets, although this is a much more important factor among girls. Socioeconomic status, which contributes greatly to a child's ability to obtain cool products, is considered one of the most important factors in a girl's popularity at school. Daughters of affluent parents are able to afford the expensive makeup and accessories that allow them to mimic societal standards of superficial beauty, making them more attractive to boys and more popular. The role of academic achievement in determining popularity also differs considerably between gender; in the first few years of school, scholastic success correlates positively with the popularity of boys. However, as boys near adolescence, doing well in school is often viewed as a source of shame and an indication of femininity. Additionally, disregard for authority and an attitude of disobedience is common among popular boys. Among girls, academic achievement has little correlation with popularity at all. Girls are more likely to value effort over inherent ability, while the opposite is true for boys. Both genders place a value on social intelligence, with children more skilled at mature interaction with peers and adults generally being more popular. The independent hierarchical popularity structures for boys and girls act as mechanisms that mediate the interaction of the two genders. At first, cross-gender interaction is discouraged as the boys and girls divide themselves and create mostly separate social spheres. Especially among boys, behavior and habits associated with the opposite gender are deemed undesirable and punishable traits. Although most young boys exhibit curiosity regarding the opposite sex while in a private setting, such curiosity displayed in public is socially unacceptable. Members of each gender strive to attain their actively constructed, somewhat shared, ideal of masculinity or femininity, at the same time harboring a secret interest in the mysteries of the opposite gender. As children mature and refine their ideas about what it means to be a man or a woman, it gradually becomes acceptable to approach individuals of the other sex. Cross gender relationships generally improve social status only to the extent that they are romantically oriented, as mere friendships that do not involve kissing or dating are often viewed with suspicion. Early on, interaction with the opposite gender is reserved for only the most popular boys and girls, and couples tend to match themselves roughly according to popularity through junior high and beyond.  Stereotypes in the media  Young children aged around four to five years old have been shown to possess very strong gender stereotypes. In addition to parents' and teachers' intentional efforts to shape gender roles, children also learn through mass media (television, books, radio, magazines, and newspaper), to which children are exposed to every day. For preschool-aged children, an important source of such information is the picture books written specifically for their age group, which are often read and reread to them in their impressionable years. In a study done by Oskamp, Kaufman, and Wolterbeek, it was found that in picture books for the preschool audience, the male characters played the more active and explorative role and the female characters played the more passive and social role. Of course, these studies completely neglect the profound effects of genetics on imposing gender-specific behavior.Reiner WG1, Gearhart JP, (2004) Discordant sexual identity in some genetic males with cloacal exstrophy assigned to female sex at birth. N Engl J Med. Jan 22;350(4):333-41. From birth, children are able to quickly learn that a great deal of their lives have to deal with masculinity and femininity. Even though many environmental factors influence construction of gender, nothing in biology labels behaviors as right or wrong, normal or abnormal. Though parents and teachers teach these lessons intentionally as well as unintentionally, young children also learn through television. As has been proven, a significant source of cultural gendered messages is television, perhaps most powerful for children who watch up to an average of four hours daily. With impressionable young minds, a wide variety of information can help shape these children's views on male and female roles in society. Children are exposed to Disney media through both film and retail products. In 2015, Disney made $2.64 billion in global retail sales.Golden, Julia C, and Jennifer Wallace Jacoby. “Playing Princess: Preschool Girls’ Interpretations of Gender Stereotypes in Disney Princess Media.” Sex Roles : A Journal of Research, vol. 79, no. 5-6, 2018, pp. 299–313., doi:10.1007/s11199-017-0773-8. Through these films and products, Disney portrays distinct gender roles. Parents tend to view Disney Princess media as a safe choice for their children compared to more sexualized media characters and programs.Coyne SM, et al. “Pretty As a Princess: Longitudinal Effects of Engagement with Disney Princesses on Gender Stereotypes, Body Esteem, and Prosocial Behavior in Children.” Child Development, vol. 87, no. 6, 2016, pp. 1909–1925., doi:10.1111/cdev.12569. Some parents proceed with caution when it comes to Disney media as Disney has fostered criticism for glamorizing its characters, creating female protagonists who need to be saved by men, and adding sexual subliminal messaging. In 19 Disney movies (The Lion King, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Aladdin, Cinderella, Toy Story, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, Pocahontas, The Jungle Book, Peter Pan, 101 Dalmatians, The Fox and the Hound, Pinocchio, Lady and the Tramp, Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), Hercules (1997), Mulan (1998), and Tarzan (1999)), it was found that males made up 63% of Disney characters while females made up 28%. The other 9% were characters whose gender could not be determined.Faherty, Vincent E. “Is the Mouse Sensitive? A Study of Race, Gender, and Social Vulnerability in Disney Animated Films.” Simile: Studies in Media & Information Literacy Education, vol. 1, no. 3, 2001, pp. 1–8. doi:10.3138/sim.1.3.001. Accessed 2 Oct. 2019. Disney female characters were six times more likely to partake in housework than their male counterparts. Also, the average princess is young and beautiful with large eyes, a small nose and chin, bigger breasts, a thin body type, and good skin. In research done on the effects of Disney characters, results have shown that as early as preschool, children begin to demonstrate a preference for thin body figures. Girls around 5 and older display worries about getting fat and begin to experience issues with body esteem. Educational researchers studied children in kindergarten to see how Disney media affected children’s play time. Disney media toys encourage children to role play through repeating familiar scripts and characters that they have seen in Disney programs. This sets literary limits and social boundaries for the children as they repeat similar dialogue, plot points, and character roles. This also means that Disney Princess toys influence children's behavior by conveying subtle narratives about both identity and status as they often reflect societal beliefs about both gender and childhood.Wohlwend, Karen E. “Damsels in Discourse: Girls Consuming and Producing Identity Texts through Disney Princess Play.” Reading Research Quarterly, vol. 44, no. 1, 2009, pp. 57–83., doi:10.1598/RRQ.44.1.3. Disney has three distinct eras of princesses—classical, renaissance, and revival. Each of these eras portray distinct stereotypes. The Classical Princesses include Snow White, Cinderella, and Aurora. These films were created during a time where family values and the idea of a housewife was present in American society. These characters have domestic lifestyles and are described as innocent and pure, often being associated with flowers (roses).HIGGS, SAM. “Damsels in Development REPRESENTATION, TRANSITION AND THE DISNEY PRINCESS.” Screen Education, no. 83, Spring 2016, pp. 62–69. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx direct=true&db;=a9h&AN;=118191998&site;=ehost- live. The Renaissance Princesses include Ariel, Belle, and Mulan. This era coincided with third-wave feminism. The princesses are seen fighting their patriarchal systems and tend to be less passive, but they still reinforce many of the same values. They are highly praised for their beauty, and a large emphasis remains on finding true love.HIGGS, SAM. “Damsels in Development REPRESENTATION, TRANSITION AND THE DISNEY PRINCESS.” Screen Education, no. 83, Spring 2016, pp. 62–69.

These protagonists are more independent and intelligent, but they are often viewed as odd or crazy, such as Tiana, for having a dream and vision for their lives. These characters are modern, hardworking, and independent.Hefner, Veronica, et al. “Happily Ever After? A Content Analysis of Romantic Ideals in Disney Princess Films.” Communication Studies, vol. 68, no. 5, 2017, pp. 511–532., doi:10.1080/10510974.2017.1365092. A study done by Powel and Abel analyzed how sex-role stereotypes in television programs such as Teletubbies and Barney are aimed at the preschool audience. In their analysis, Powel and Abel found that gendered messages and behavior is present in preschool television programming and this was found through eight different themes and out of the eight themes five of them, leadership, appearance, gendered roles, occupations, and play roles, were significantly gendered. In both Barney and Teletubbies, males served as the leaders and the director of action. The three youngest Teletubbies automatically followed the oldest who happens to be male like. The pattern being set is that males lead and females follow. On the other hand, Barney is also the male leader but he leads the children as a caring, social values, \\"feminized\\" male teacher. The reconfiguring of leadership as social and friendly leadership can be seen an alteration of a typical male teacher but the sex-stereotype of male being leaders is reinforced for the preschool aged children. Reconfiguring of the male characters was also prevalent for the four remaining themes that were gendered. The males in these shows were taller in stature, wore darker colored clothing but sometimes wore shorts and skirts. As for gendered roles, the males were generally more active while the females were more social and passive. Neither program showed men and women in non- stereotypical occupational roles, indicating that at an early age, children are exposed to gender -specific occupational expectations. In play roles when it was either time for story time or play time the females played the more passive roles such as setting up a picnic, while the males played the more active roles such as fox chasing. These findings help shed light on to the findings from a study carried out by Durkin and Nugent. Durkin and Nugent examined four- and five-year-old children's predictions concerning the sex of the persons carrying out a variety of common activities and occupations on television. The children's responses revealed strong gender stereotyped expectations, and these were strongest in the case of masculine stereotyped activities. Also, they found that children's estimates of their own future competence also indicated stereotypical beliefs, with the females more likely to reject masculine activities. Young children will indeed see stereotypical sex-role models of the feminine and masculine in the media that is geared towards them, but they will also see social skills being affirmed for both sexes. We can conclude that mass media have the power to confirm both stereotypes and non-traditional gendered behavior-though more for boys than girls.  Environmental factors and parental influences  The first major exposure to gender roles typically comes from a child's parents. Children are often dressed in gender specific clothing and given gender specific toys from birth. Parents may encourage children to participate in gender stereotypical play, such as girls playing with dolls and boys playing with trucks. Parents may also model gender normative behavior, both unintentionally and intentionally. Parental disapproval for failing to comply with gender norms and parental approval for successful compliance with these norms can serve to solidify children's understanding of gender roles.Witt, Susan D. Parental Influences on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles. CalPoly College of Liberal Arts. Retrieved 11 November 2013 from http://cla.calpoly.edu/~bmori/syll/311syll/Witt.html The parental affect and level of disciple children receive may be related to their gender. In 2001, Claire Hughes found parents of young girls were more likely to have more positive overall affect and stronger discipline. Hughes also found parental warmth to be associated with the development of theory of mind for girls, but not for boys. Hughes suggested this may have to do with a greater tendency for girls to use understanding of mind to seek emotional support, empathize, and cooperate. Children can learn about emotions in a few different ways, by witnessing others’ feelings and emotions, having their emotional displays responded to, and lastly the ways they are taught about their feelings and emotions. Parents have been found to talk about emotions differently to their sons and daughters. Both mothers and fathers use more emotion words and make more references to sadness and disliking of events, with their daughters than their sons. As a result of this, girls use more emotion words than boys do. Girls’ emotional socialization has in a way been more developed because of this. Not only do girls understand emotions better but, they are also better than boys at applying cultural standards of emotion expression in everyday life. Girls and boys may also differ in the ways they apply their awareness of mind to their relationships with others. One example of this is, girls may show a greater tendency than boys to use their increasing understanding of mind to elicit emotional support, or to develop their skills of empathy and cooperation. Children between the ages of 3 to 6 may have difference in their levels of interest in infants and practicing nurturance behaviors. Judith Blakemore found that when children were given opportunities to interact with infants, boys were less likely to show interest in the younger child. In general, children without younger sibling were more likely to show interest, which may be related to the novelty of an infant. Of children with younger siblings, the gender difference was strong, and may be related to the child having learned gender roles by viewing the upbringing of their siblings. No group showed less interest in the infants than the male children with siblings. Children with egalitarian parents tended to show the least gender differences in interest in the infants.  Gender identity  Gender identity typically develops in stages: * Around age two: Children become conscious of the physical differences between boys and girls. * Before their third birthday: Most children can easily label themselves as either a boy or a girl. * By age four: Most children have a stable sense of their gender identity During this same time of life, children learn gender role behavior—that is, doing \\"things that boys do\\" or \\"things that girls do.\\" However, cross-gender preferences and play are a normal part of gender development and exploration regardless of their future gender identity. The point is that all children tend to develop a clearer view of themselves and their gender over time. At any point, research suggests that children who assert a gender-diverse identity know their gender as clearly and consistently as their developmentally matched peers and benefit from the same level of support, love, and social acceptance.  How do children typically express their gender identity?  In addition to their choices of toys, games, and sports, children typically express their gender identity in the following ways: * Clothing or hairstyle * Preferred name or nickname * Social behavior that reflects varying degrees of aggression, dominance, dependency, and gentleness. * Manner and style of behavior and physical gestures and other nonverbal actions identified as masculine or feminine. * Social relationships, including the gender of friends, and the people he or she decides to imitate. Gender development is a normal process for all children. Some children will exhibit variations―similar to all areas of human health and behavior. However, all children need support, love, and care from family, school, and society, which fosters growth into happy and healthy adults.  Social impacts  The social impacts of imposing gender roles on children become evident very early in life and usually follow the child as they continue their development. It is most observable when they interact with other members of their age group. A child's peers serve as both an archetype and a sounding board for the proper way to express themselves. In her book Sex Differences in Social Behavior: A Social-role Interpretation, Alice Eagly affirms the idea that gender roles are a direct result of one's social interactions.Eagly, A. H. Sex Differences in Social Behavior: A Social- role Interpretation. Hillsdale, NJ: L. Erlbaum Associates, 1987. Google Books. 13 May 2013. Web. 11 Nov. 2013. She calls social behavior \\"gender-stereotypic\\" and says that most of the expectations of gender roles come from the stereotypes associated with them, such as a woman to be kind and compassionate and a man to be in control and independent. \\"This theory implicates conformity to gender-role expectations as a major source of the sexes' differing behavior.\\" As a child explores those things in life that they may enjoy, the acceptance or criticism or their peers is crucial in whether or not they will continue to perform an activity. Children are especially apt at noticing when one of their peers violates their established gender role. As Fagot (1990) found, children had a pronounced response when one of their peers violated their established gender role.Parke, R. D., & Gauvain, M. (2009). \\"Gender Roles and Gender Differences.\\" Child Psychology: A Contemporary Viewpoint. 7th ed. Boston: McGraw Hill, 2009. 475-503. Print. Same-sex peers acted as the distributors of both rewards for proper gender role behavior and punishments for improper gender role behavior. Boys who preferred to play with dolls rather than trucks were five to six times more likely to be harassed by their peers than those who conformed to the norm. Girls who preferred to play firefighter rather than nurse were ignored rather than criticized. Most importantly, Fagot's study shows the effect of gender segregation on children; boys tended to respond more readily to feedback from other boys while girls likewise responded to feedback from other girls. By surrounding themselves with members of the same sex, children are placing themselves in a situation where they more readily accept and conform to accepted gender roles. A study by Carol Martin (1990) shows that cross-sex behavior is generally discouraged in both sexes, though more so in males. Those that do exhibit cross-sex behavior are branded as either a sissy (a rather derogatory term used for boys exhibiting feminine characteristics) or a tomboy (a term for girls exhibiting male characteristics, though not as stigmatized as sissy). Gender roles place constraints upon what a child is allowed to do, based upon what their peers deem is acceptable. As children grow older and are more able to grasp the concept of gender and gender roles, they begin to spend more time with children of the same sex, further exacerbating the proliferation of gender roles. Martin and Fabes observed that by the age of two, children were already beginning to show a preference for interacting with children of the same sex. By the time a child is three or four, the vast majority of their peer interactions are with members of the same sex. As Maccoby observed, by the age of four and a half, children spend three times as much time with same-sex play partners; by six and a half, that amount increases to eleven times. Martin and Fabes observed that as the children began to segregate themselves by gender, the activities they performed also aligned with their chosen play partners; boys tended to choose playmates who were more active and rowdy while girls chose playmates that were more calm and cooperative. Children generally fall into these patterns with little guidance from either parents or teachers; they are encouraged to interact with members of the same sex and begin to adopt behavior that is considered gender appropriate. This phenomenon is known as self-socialization and drives the interaction between children throughout their young lives. This instinctive segregation encourages the gap between males and females and helps to reinforce gender roles as the child continues to grow.

Early life Robidoux was born in 1794 in Saint Louis, the fourth of six sons of Joseph Robidoux III, the owner of a Saint Louis-based fur trading company, and his wife Catherine Marie Rollet dit Laderoute. The Robidoux family is strongly connected to the history of the North American fur trade, with all of Joseph Robidoux's sons having participated to one degree or another in the family business. One of Antoine's five brothers, Joseph Robidoux IV, established the Blacksnake Hills Trading Post that eventually became the town of St. Joseph, Missouri. Antoine spoke English, French, and Spanish. In his early years he helped his father extend his business westward, and by the 1820s was focused on developing trade routes in the intermountain corridors of what was at the time the Mexican province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México. In the summer of 1824, Antoine may have joined a party led by Etienne Provost that traveled to the Uinta Basin to trade for pelts. He eventually established a permanent residence in the capital city of Santa Fe, and in 1828, he took for his common-law wife Carmel Benevides (1812–1888), the daughter of a Spanish captain who was killed fighting the Comanche and subsequently the adopted daughter of the provincial governor. The couple adopted a girl, Carmelete, who married Isador Barada. Barada and his brother Edmund were arrested in 1849 for illegally operating a gaming house and fined $50 each. Their subsequent appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court resulted in a reversal of their conviction. In 1829, Antoine and his younger brother Louis Robidoux petitioned for and were granted Mexican citizenship, which freed them to trade and settle in Mexican territory without having to worry about expensive tariffs and other international restrictions, as well as near-exclusive license to trap and trade in the Ute country of what is now western Colorado and eastern Utah. By 1830, Antoine had become a prominent citizen of Santa Fe in social and economic circles. He was even elected the first non-Mexican alcalde of the ayuntamiento (the municipal council), though his political career was short- lived. Around the same time, and possibly in partnership with Louis, Antoine established Fort Uncompahgre near the confluence of the Gunnison River (then known as the Río San Xavier) and the Uncompahgre River in west-central Colorado. Though the exact date of its completion is unknown, Robidoux's post was arguably the first permanent trading operation west of the continental divide. In 1832, Robidoux purchased the Reed Trading Post, a single cabin built by William Reed and Denis Julien four years earlier at the confluence of the Uinta and Whiterocks rivers in northeastern Utah, and rebuilt it much larger as Fort Robidoux, also called Fort Uintah and Fort Winty. The fort was visited by many well-known pioneers and mountain men during its years of operation, including Marcus Whitman, Miles Goodyear, and Kit Carson. Westwater Canyon inscription Robidoux spent more than a decade managing both trading posts and exploring the Western interior. He is especially well known for having carved a famous rock inscription on a wall of Utah's Westwater Canyon during this time. Likely ascending a trapper's trail from the canyon's mouth on the Colorado River, Robidoux left the following record of his presence engraved on a sandstone bluff: The inscription was not again brought to public attention until 1933, when Charles Kelly first photographed it. It has since yielded many interpretations in attempts to more accurately pinpoint the precise dates of Robidoux's operations in the area. The most direct translation from the French reads \\"Antoine Robidoux passed here 13 November 1837 to establish a trading post at the Green or Wiyté River\\", but the accuracy of this translation has been a matter of controversy among historians. Specifically, it has been suggested that the word \\"Wiyté\\" was actually intended to read \\"Winté\\", and that deterioration has made the appearance of the third letter ambiguous; though the Green and the White are both names for rivers in Utah, \\"Winté\\" may instead be a reference to the Uinta River, which was at the time commonly called the \\"Winty\\". If this alternative translation is correct, then the inscription appears to suggest that Robidoux had not yet established a trading post on the Uinta River by 1837. This contradicts evidence that he purchased and rebuilt the Reed Trading Post on the Uinta River in 1832, five years earlier. A simple solution is that the year engraved in the inscription has also been misinterpreted, and that the original message reads \\"1831\\" instead of \\"1837\\"; this would be a logical fit with the notion that Robidoux may have been searching for a place to establish a new trading post in late 1831, shortly before he eventually did so when he bought the Reed Trading Post. Yet there is evidence that Antoine Robidoux was actually in Missouri selling furs and procuring supplies in November 1831, making it impossible for him to have carved the inscription at that time. A third solution is that 1837 is actually correct and that Robidoux was, in fact, planning to build a third, unidentified trading post in a new location at the time, which either never materialized or was built and subsequently lost to history. Later life Both Fort Uncompahgre and Fort Robidoux were evidently attacked and destroyed by Utes in 1844, just as the fur trade was declining with changes in the European market. These circumstances prompted Robidoux to quickly abandon his fur enterprise and return east to St. Joseph. Over the next decade, he worked in various capacities as an emigrant guide and a U.S. Army interpreter. In June 1846, Robidoux enlisted as an interpreter with General Stephen W. Kearny's expedition to California during the Mexican–American War. He was severely wounded at the Battle of San Pasqual in December and later applied for a government pension. Robidoux died in 1860 in St. Joseph, Missouri, at the age of 65.

Plot summary The Secret of the title is the parentage of the heroine, Rosamond Treverton, who has been passed off as the daughter of the wealthy former actress Mrs Treverton of Porthgenna Tower, but is in fact the illegitimate child of her servant Sarah Leeson by a local miner (Mrs Treverton’s motive was to provide her husband with a child, being apparently unable to bear children herself). Sarah writes down the details of the Secret from the words of the dying Mrs Treverton, and hides the paper bearing the message in an unused room at Porthgenna. The novel then jumps forward some twenty years. Rosamond has married the blind Leonard Frankland, who now owns Porthgenna Tower. Sarah, now living under her married name, acts as a nurse after Rosamond-s childbirth, and gives Rosamund a cryptic warning to avoid the room in which the Secret is hidden. On a visit to Porthgenna, Rosamond finds the paper detailing the Secret and reveals it to Leonard. Leonard, who originally believed that Rosamond was a wealthy heiress, accepts that his wife is illegitimate, but refuses to accept her inheritance as the presumed daughter of the Trevertons. In the course of things, this would now pass to Mrs Treverton’s miserly brother-in-law Andrew (whose introduction, together with his villainous servant, provides some comic relief in the novel). But Andrew Treverton, somewhat out of character, refuses to accept the windfall and Rosamond remains the heiress of the Trevertons in the expected happy ending. Themes and influences Like its predecessor Hide and Seek, the “secret” and the mystery are made clear to the reader, though not to the novel’s characters, at an early stage. The obsessed and arguably deranged Sarah prefigures the character of Hester Dethridge in Collins's Man and Wife, and more distantly those of Lydia Gwilt in Armadale and the female protagonist of his late novel, The Haunted Hotel. The blind Leonard is another of Collins's disabled characters. He plays only a small part in the novel, but Collins drew another and more significant blind character in Lucilla, the heroine of his 1872 novel Poor Miss Finch. Much of the novel is set in Cornwall, one of Collins's favourite English counties, which also features in his early melodrama Basil. Publication The Dead Secret was first published serially in Charles Dickens's \\"Household Words\\" in 1856, and by Bradbury & Evans later the same year. Critical reception Contemporary critics held mixed opinions, some seeing an advance on Collins's previous Hide and Seek, and some less enthusiastic. Peters regards the handling of the “secret” as a weakness in construction, and does not rate the novel highly within Collins's oeuvre. Nadel’s description of it as the last of Collins's \\"apprentice novels” emphasises the gap between it and Collins's next novel, the acclaimed The Woman in White. Nevertheless it has proved enduringly popular and remains in print.

It is a joint project of the Israeli Space Agency and CNES. The project was signed upon in April 2005 and was launched on the 2nd of August 2017. The microsatellite, which was set to cost the ISA US$20 million and CNES €10 million, was designed and built by IAI and Rafael under ISA's supervision. For the mission, CNES is responsible for supplying the superspectral camera and the science mission center. The ISA is responsible for the satellite control center, the technological mission and payload (Israeli Hall effect Thruster and autonomous mission), the spacecraft, and the launcher interface. History A joint study to check feasibility of the program was done on the first half of 2005. Phase A started in 2005 and upon completion, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the ISA and CNES. in April 2005, declaring the satellite to be built. The satellite was originally planned to be launched in 2008; however due to changes of the launchers and several delays, the launch date was pushed to 2 August 2017. It was launched via a Vega launcher from Guiana Space Centre together with Italian satellite OPTSAT-3000. Mission The satellite has a scientific and a technological mission. Scientific mission requirements were defined by Centre d'Etudes Spatiales de la BIOsphère, France, and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel, and CNES. Technological Mission requirement were defined by Rafael. =Scientific mission= The satellite has a 2-day revisit orbit which allows constant viewing angles at constant Sun lighting angles. The unique combination is hoped to allow the development of new image processing methods. A set of at least 50 points of interest around the world were chosen to be scanned throughout the scientific mission. The points will be rescanned every 2 days for the entire duration of the mission where it will collect sensory and imagery data. Some of the objectives from the scientific mission are: * Monitoring and analyzing surface under various environmental and human factors * Develop and validate various ecosystem functioning models * Improve and validate global carbon cycle models * Define theoretical and practical methods for scale transfer * Collect and analyze data collected by the low spatial resolution sensors The satellite is equipped with a Super Spectral Camera comprises a catadioptric optical system, a focal plane assembly with narrow band filters, and 4 detector units with 3 separate CCD-TDI array. Each array with separate operational and thermal control. The satellite is also equipped with a Ritchey-Chretien telescope with a focal length of 1.75m and a diameter of 0.25m. The telescope's tube will be covered to protect it from pollution and dust which will deploy once in orbit. =Technological mission= VENμS Hall effect thruster In addition to its scientific mission, the satellite has a technological mission. The satellite is equipped with Israeli hall effect thrusters (IHET). The mission is to demonstrate the thrusters' enhanced capabilities and autonomous mission operations which include: * Orbit maintenance * LEO to LEO orbit transfer * Enabling imaging mission in a high drag environment - performing the scientific mission at an altitude of 410 km on an Earth repeating sun synchronous orbit The technological mission is designed to use 16 kg of Xenon. Platform The satellite platform is based on the Israel Aerospace Industries OPSAT 3000 satellite platform. Venus satellite will have dual propulsion system: Hydrazine for orbit insertion and Xenon for the technological mission. Venus satellite mass is 265 kg (wet), of which 16 kg are Xenon and 7 kg are hydrazine. Ground control station The satellite is ground controlled by IAI in Israel; the Israel mission control is linked to two sub-stations in charge of each of the missions: The scientific mission is operated from Toulouse Space Center, France and the technology mission is controlled from the Technological Mission Center, Rafael, Haifa, Israel.

Airing as the 19th episode of the second season, it was first broadcast in the United States on February 11, 1980, and the concept for the episode was described as \\"admirably ambitious\\" by William Beamon, writing in the St. Petersburg Evening Independent before he had viewed the episode. The plot is set around the real-life The Who concert disaster in Cincinnati of December 3, 1979, set within the context of the show's fictional universe, and was written, taped and aired within 11 weeks of that deadly disaster. Plot The radio station promotes a concert by The Who, and employees prepare to attend the concert. Station employees are overcome with guilt after a push for seats by attending fans results in some fans being crushed to death. The next day, they discuss the tragic events, the fallibility of festival seating, and the sorrow felt by both the staff and the people of Cincinnati. Background The December 3, 1979, concert at the Riverfront Coliseum in Cincinnati was the 14th stop during The Who's 1979 world tour. Of the 18,348 tickets sold for the concert, 14,770 were for unassigned seats known as festival seating, obtained on a first-come, first-served basis. City officials had objected to the use of festival seating at the facility as early as October 1976. Attendees arrived as much as six hours before the start of the concert to attempt to garner the best available seats, and a crowd had gathered by 3:00 p.m. ET. An hour before the start of the concert, \\"thousands were tightly packed around the entrance doors\\", and by 7:20 p.m. ET the crowd consisted of 8,000 people. Some members of the crowd rushed the gates on the plaza level on the west side of the Coliseum, crushing those at the front. The incident resulted in the death of 11 individuals by compressive asphyxia and injuries to 23. In a press conference after the concert, police lieutenant Dale Menkhaus stated that too few gate doors had been opened, and witnesses stated only one door had been opened at the main gate. Menkahus stated that the doors had been purposely kept closed because The Who had arrived late for a soundcheck. An emergency room supervisor stated that the victims had sustained \\"multiple contusions and hemorrhages\\". The facility and its executives had received lawful orders from the city's fire chief as early as 1976 concerning event actions, such as \\"locking and barring of exit doors during performances, overcrowded conditions and the blocking of aisles\\". Executives were later charged for failure to comply with those lawful orders. Security for a concert by The Who in Buffalo, New York the next night was doubled, and the band dedicated it to the victims. Two concerts scheduled at Riverfront Coliseum were postponed: that by Blue Öyster Cult on December 14, and that by Aerosmith on December 21. On December 27, 1979, the Cincinnati municipal council enacted bylaws banning festival seating as a result of this event. The council and the Government of Ohio also passed laws involving crowd control. The cities of Indianapolis and Louisville prepared ordinances to ban festival seating. Conception and development Hugh Wilson, the show's producer, said he initially rejected the idea for the episode, but later accepted when writers told him that the incident happened in Cincinnati, in which the show is based, and involved rock and roll, the show's primary subject. The episode would focus on the fact that few cities in the United States addressed the issue of festival and unreserved seating after the incident. Richard Sanders stated that the cast had a \\"hard time to get up for some of the comic parts of the show\\" because of the subject of the episode. He stated that the \\"whole cast had read the articles, everything we could get hold of, about the incident\\" and that it was a \\"hard week to get through\\". In an interview with WEBN, Sanders stated that the cast \\"had an objective in mind\\" so that \\"other cities will become conscious of the dangers\\" of festival seating. The production team had requested from WCPO-TV (the CBS affiliate station in Cincinnati from 1961 to 1996) footage of a candlelight memorial service for the victims held at the Coliseum. The station's vice president Robert Gordon rejected the request stating \\"this incident is so sensitive that we don't wish to participate without greater control or knowledge of the end product\\". Gordon had stated that the station would not broadcast the episode. After he and other network officials previewed it, they \\"found it in good taste and allowed it to be aired\\". Before being broadcast, CBS vice president of operations Donn O'Brien told Wilson that the episode would not include the ending with a printed crawl message listing all cities in the United States to enact bylaws or pass an ordinance banning festival and unreserved seating. Cincinnati was the only city listed.

Early in the French Revolutionary Wars Trimmer captured a privateer. Though she never sailed again after December 1793, the Navy converted her to a temporary fire ship in 1798. The Admiralty sold her in 1801. Capture Anti-Briton was commissioned at Dunkirk. From 1781 she was under the command of Captain John Kelly, who went under the alias of Jean Grumlé.Demerliac (2004), N°1719, p. 177. On 4 January 1782, Stag under the command of Captain Robert Palliser Cooper, captured Anti-Briton, which was under the command of John Kelly. Cooper had received intelligence that a privateer cutter had taken several vessels in the channel between Ireland and Britain. As soon as the weather permitted, Cooper set sail and was fortunate enough to encounter and capture her. Cooper reported that he took great pleasure in capturing her as she was quite new and had done a great deal of mischief. Kelly had captured the cutter Hope in August 1781.Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. 52, p.43. Cooper brought Anti- Briton into Dublin. There it was discovered that she had been fitted out in Dunkirk and that almost all her crew were English or Irish. These men were incarcerated at Newgate Prison as traitors. Kelly was a native of Rush, but held a commission as a lieutenant in the French navy. He had reportedly captured some 170 vessels that he had destroyed or ransomed for large prices. Kelly would ensure that he received the ransom money by holding sufficient hostages until the bills drawn for the ransom were paid. (When Stag captured Anti-Briton, there were reportedly twelve hostages aboard representing some £60,000 in ransom money.) Kelly had been a smuggler; in later life he ended up a porter on the quay at Bordeaux.Marshall (1828), Supplement 2, Part 2, p. 39. Although there is a great deal of ambiguity about how many crew were abroad Anti-Briton, ultimately the authorities determined that 36 men were French. These the British treated as prisoners-of-war and incarcerated at Kilkenny. Sixty men the authorities deemed traitors. However, the men never came to trial as Stag had delivered them to Dublin, not Britain, and legal opinion was that an Admiralty court there would not have jurisdiction, and a British court would not convict them. The men were released in 1783 after the end of the war with France.Morley (2002), pp.317-320. Before her capture, Anti-Briton had captured Sally, Durham, master, which had been sailing from Leverpool to Cork. Sally was forced on shore at Barnstable. Her cargo was mostly saved but it was feared that Sally herself was destroyed/Lloyd's List №1329. Career The Admiralty registered Anti-Briton as a sloop on 7 May. However, the Navy fitted and rigged her at Plymouth as a brig between May and September. Commander John Hutt commissioned Trimmer in July. From February 1783 she was under the command of Commander William Titcher until April, when she was paid off. She was recommissioned in September, and then in May 1784 came under the command of John Luck. In February 1785 Commander Charles Tyler recommissioned her. Under Tyler she was employed in the Bristol Channel in the suppression of smuggling.O'Byrne (1849), p.201. In 1787 Lieutenant George M'Kinley went in pursuit of a smuggler in Trimmers jolly boat. He was gone for 30 hours because of a heavy gale and all but lost.O'Byrne (1849), p.703. Commander Mark Robinson became her captain in March 1789. Commander Francis Fayerman recommissioned Trimmer in October 1791. In 1793 Trimmer was on the Jersey station. There she captured one of the first armed French vessels flying the tri-colour flag. On 5 April Trimmer and the brig , under the command of George M'Kinley, captured the French privateer Courier. Commander Charles Craven took command in May, for the Channel. However, she was paid-off shortly afterwards because she was in a defective state.Marshall (1825), Vol. 2, Part 2, p.701. In December she was laid up at Sheerness. Between June and July 1798 fitted Trimmer as a fireship, but then laid her up again. Commander Edward Parker recommissioned her in March 1801, for the North Sea, but the Admiralty cancelled the deployment and ordered her sold. Fate On 30 June 1801, the Navy offered the \\"Fire Brig\\" Trimmer for sale at Sheerness. She was sold on 18 July for £710.Winfield (2008), p.279.

It was designed by Arthur Morry and built from 1885 to 1886 by Arthur Midson. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Brisbane's First Synagogue in the grounds of Aubigny, North Quay, 1930 The Jewish families who settled in Queensland from the time of Separation formed the nucleus of the Brisbane Hebrew Congregation founded in Brisbane in 1865. The congregation used a number of venues as temporary places of worship, including a building in the grounds of Samuel Davis's home at North Quay (later known as Aubigny), while raising money through various land speculations to purchase a site and build a Synagogue. The present site was purchased by R. B. Lewin and sold to the congregation for . In 1885 designs for a Synagogue were sought from architects and plans submitted by Arthur Morry, who worked in the Queensland Colonial Architect's office, were chosen. The foundation stone was laid on 7 July 1885 and a bottle containing coins, newspapers and documents was embedded beneath it. The foundation stone is no longer visible following the raising of the level of Margaret Street, and it is believed that the courtyard of the Synagogue was raised at the same time. This is supported by the fact that ventilated arches for the basement are now located well below ground level. Brisbane Synagogue, circa 1906 Arthur Midson, a prominent building contractor, built the Synagogue for the sum of . It was finally consecrated on 18 July 1886 in a ceremony of \\"the most imposing and interesting character\\" which was \\"crowded to excess\\" by people of all faiths. The building features a large circular geometric tracery window of Oamaru stone above the Margaret Street arched doorway. The stained glass lead lighting was obtained from Messrs Lyon, Cottier & Co of Sydney. The window is flanked on either side by a minaret turret which rose to a height of from the original ground level. The rendered brick structure, constructed on concrete foundations, contains a basement, a nave and side aisles on the ground floor with a minister's retiring or robe room at the rear. In accordance with traditional Jewish religious practices the sexes are separated during worship, with a gallery level for females only. It contains 140 seats and two women's retiring rooms. The Synagogue remained largely unaltered over the years. Prior to the centenary celebrations of the Brisbane Jewish community in 1965, considerable renovations were carried out, including the installation of additional stained glass windows. Many of these were donated by congregation members whose families were murdered in the Holocaust (World War II). The words \\"The Brisbane Synagogue\\" and the congregation's spiritual name \\"Kehilla Kedosha Sha'ari Emuna\\" (The Holy Congregation of the Gates of Faith) were added over the arched entry during 1967-1968.  Description  Interior of the Brisbane Synagogue during the 1930 Anzac Day ceremony The building is constructed of stuccoed brickwork on a concrete foundation. The principal feature of the Margaret Street frontage is a doorway surmounted by a massive arch above which is a large circular tracery window of Oamaru stone. The window carries the circular motif through to the geometry of the tracery, and features leadlight panels. The front is flanked on either side by a minaret turret that becomes octagonal in its upper portion with narrow slit openings, and is topped by an octagonal cupola. The end gable above the entry has a central circular ventilator below which is a frieze also including a circular motif. The portions of the building recessed to either side of the entry also have circular tracery windows in recessed arched openings at the upper level. Below these openings on each side are a pair of Romanesque arched windows. The main stepped broad arch of the entry is supported on small Corinthian columns with the front section at the top of the arch inscribed with the words \\"THE BRISBANE SYNAGOGUE\\". Above this is an ornamental row of dentils, and to either side geometrical rosettes. The back wall of the building also has a large circular tracery window of Oamaru stone. The side walls have large swinging windows to provide cross ventilation. The building was designed to accommodate 400 people, 260 of them on the ground floor and the remainder on the upper level women's gallery which extends over the entry and down both sides. The interior is divided into a nave and side aisles by large octagonal columns with moulded caps and cement bases. Broad semi-circular arches span between the capitals. The ceiling consists of timber boarding with circular fretwork ventilators evenly spaced down the centre. The gallery is supported on small trusses and is approached by two flights of stairs, one at the front and the other at the rear. The seating on both levels is stepped and faces the centre where there is a carved timber platform. An arched recess approached by stone steps is located in the end wall. This has a circular tracery window above it, and is flanked on either side by marble plaques. Brightly coloured stained glass is situated in the circular windows on the gallery level and also the arched lower openings.  Heritage listing  The Brisbane Synagogue was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Brisbane Synagogue is Brisbane's first purpose built Synagogue, and is significant as an important development in nineteenth century Jewish worship in the city. The building reflects the development of Jewish settlement in the city during the 1880s. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The addition of windows are a rare Brisbane memorial to Jewish people who died in the Second World War. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. Located within the foundation stone cavity are artefacts and memorabilia which have the potential for yielding information about the Jewish community in the 1880s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Brisbane Synagogue is significant as an example of the design work of Arthur Morry, prominent Brisbane architect, and of Arthur Midson, local building contractor. As an example of Australian-Jewish places of worship, the Brisbane Synagogue typifies the customs and liturgical practices of the Hebrew community. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. As a free-standing element with an entry porch, the building contributes to the streetscape of Margaret Street. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The adaption in its design of both circular and octagonal elements to a traditional plan form to create a style suitable for an inner-city Synagogue. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building also has special significance to Brisbane's Hebrew community.

Mechanical components in the drivetrain of vehicles may bind and wear, which may occur when tires of varying sizes are used on one vehicle. It is a particular issue in 4WD cars with tires having varied tread patterns or brands. Despite marked size, different brands often differ in actual size. Even if both front and rear are the same brand, and marked with the same size they may still differ in actual size. A pull to the right or left when driving or braking could trigger windup caused by mismatched tire tread/sizes.  H-drive  Alvis Saladin, with white-striped hubs to indicate potential driveline wind-up, not helped by different tire pressures specified for each wheel Heavy off-road vehicles using 6×6 or 8×8 may use a H-drive drivetrain. These are particularly prone to driveline windup. H-drives do not use axles but rather individual wheel stations, carried on a punt or backbone chassis. A single differential splits the drive into separate left and right drive shafts, which each run fore and aft inside the bottom corners of the chassis. At each wheel station a bevel box drives the half shaft out to the wheel. Unlike a typical transfer box for permanent four-wheel drive, there is no differential action front-to-back. When used for equally spaced wheels (i.e. rather than cargo trucks with close-set rear axles) the front two wheels are arranged so that both steer, the rear less so than the leading wheel. The varying track radii mean that when the vehicle drives in a curve on firm tarmac each wheel travels a different distance. Without differential action between the wheels on each side, wind-up can occur in the bevels and shafts. This system and its drawbacks are probably best known through the Alvis FV600 chassis, the Stalwart and family. As well as the bevel boxes in the hull, these used an epicyclic hub gear. Standard operating instructions recommend that after travelling some miles on firm ground, the vehicle should be bounced over a curb or railway sleeper to lift wheels clear of the ground, one-by-one, to allow them to spring back and release the windup. Excess windup could easily lead to a broken gear in the bevel or hub gearboxes. To indicate this, white lines were painted across the ends of the hubs. Normally the lines should be parallel but as windup occurred they would become misaligned, indicating the need to release this.

Patricia Jones played the lead role, and also starred in the NBC series Martin Kane, Private Eye (1951). Highway to the Stars aired on Tuesdays at 7:30pm ET, not Thursdays as stated in Billboard. Like many other local series on WABD, it may have been considered eligible to be picked up as a network series. Premise The premise was described by Billboard as \\"the travails of a corn-bred gal warbler [singer] trying to make good in the big town\\". Episode status As with most DuMont series, no episodes are known to exist. Methods to record live television, such as kinescopes were only just becoming available by the time the series ended. The network probably thought there was no need to record the series in the first place, given that it aired on a single station only, though a couple kinescopes do remain of WABD's local programming of the following year (1948).

Life and career Nakano was born in Ōzu, Ehime on May 27, 1909. His interest in music was sparked in early childhood by the sound of the organ at a local Christian church where his father served as a pastor. When he became older, he joined his congregation's choir where his interest in Western music grew. He later credited the experience as the greatest influence on his career as a jazz singer. In 1929 he enrolled at the Musashino Academia Musicae and graduated from the school's vocal department in 1932. At his debut recital in the spring of that year, Nakano presented a program of selections from Kurt Weill's The Threepenny Opera, which had been premiered in Japan earlier that year. Among the songs Nakano included in his program was Mack the Knife. He was discovered by the composer Kōsaku Yamada, who attended the concert on a scouting trip for Nippon Columbia. Soon afterwards he signed a contract with the label, who was marketed as a rival to fellow baritone and Musashino Academia Musicae alumni Tamaki Tokuyama on Nippon Victor Records. Influenced by work of The Mills Brothers and The Comedian Harmonists, Nakano founded his own vocal group in 1934: the . A string of hits followed, beginning with their cover of Leslie Sarony's . Ryōichi Hattori later collaborated with Nakano and his group, producing some of the group's most memorable songs. One of their most controversial numbers was 1940's , which satirized the widespread shortages of food and materials in wartime Japan. The song's subsequent ban, as well as a general government crackdown on jazz music, resulted in the Rhythm Boys' breakup in 1941. Nakano went on to continue a solo career. After the war, Nakano joined King Records, but quickly retired from singing citing a throat injury. Composition became the focus of the final part of his career, penning hit songs for Chiemi Eri, Utako Matsushima, Hachirō Kasuga, Michiya Mihashi and Ichirō Wakahara. Death Nakano died February 19, 1970 from lung cancer, aged 60. He was buried at the Zōshigaya Cemetery.

Biography Elizabeth Nelson Adams and Tippi Hedren in 2009 (in front of one of Adams's paintings) in Los Angeles, CA. A recipient of a scholarship from The National Merit Scholarship Program, Adams went to The University of South Carolina where she earned her AB degree in 1961. She later earned her Masters in English (1987) and her PhD in creative writing (1989) from The University of South Carolina. She was married to Ambassador Weston Adams (diplomat), and they have four children. From 1995 to 2000, Adams served on the South Carolina Arts Commission. She served on the Board of Directors of The South Carolina Governor's School for the Arts & Humanities. Writer and artist A prolific poet and writer, Adams is the author of Gathering the Rain (1990), and of Five Malawian Writers: An Essay in Personal Exploration (1987). A successful painter, Adams has had shows throughout South Carolina, in Los Angeles, Palm Beach, Nantucket, and Lilongwe, Malawi, Africa. In 2007 and 2009, she had art shows in Los Angeles to raise money for Tippi Hedren’s Shambala Preserve. Shambala is a nonprofit organization founded by Hedren in 1983, which cares for endangered exotic big cats such as African lions, Siberian tigers and Bengal tigers, leopards and other big cats. Between 1984 and 1986, Adams spent her time painting and writing in Malawi, Africa. Her paintings captured the landscape and the people of the former British colony. During that period she wrote Five Malawian Writers: An Essay in Personal Exploration (1987). She studied the culture of Malawi, from Lilongwe, to the northern Nyika Plateau, to Lake Malawi, and to the southern Zomba Plateau. Her extensive travels through Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and other African countries, are reflected in her body of work. Lithography became a passion of Adams in the 1990s, which can be seen in her series of Italian lithographs. She traveled extensively through Italy, from Tuscany to Lake Como, and captured the architecture, landscapes, and people of the country in her paintings, lithographs, sculpture, and poetry. Adams's art has also shown at the Piccolo Spoleto Festival, part of The Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston, South Carolina. Adams's poetry has been published in numerous poetry books and reviews across the United States, including From The Green Horseshoe (1987) and others. Film work Adams was instrumental in the development and production of the feature film The Last Confederate: The Story of Robert Adams from Solar Filmworks and ThinkFilm (2007). With her knowledge of the history and nuances of southern culture, Adams impacted the telling of the story in the script phase, in the casting, and the production design of the film. She was the Casting Director of the movie, bringing in such talent as Tippi Hedren (who played Grandmother Adams in the film) and Edwin McCain (who played Belcher in the film). Adams also acted in the role of Madame Bonneau.

Reflecting its status as a de facto standard for such transfers, BLAST, along with XMODEM, was briefly under official consideration by ANSI in the mid-80s as part of that organization's ultimately futile attempt to establish a single de jure standard. Overview BLAST grew out of the mission-critical experience of providing air pollution telemetry within the dial-up communications environment of the petroleum belt of southern Louisiana and Texas, with not only noisy telephone lines but also unexpected satellite hops to remote locations.Smith, G. W. \\"Aesthetic Wilderness: A Brief Personal History of the Meeting Between Art and the Machine\\", Birds-of-the-Air Press, 2011. Estill, Lyle \\"Small is Possible: Life in a Local Economy\\", New Society Publishers, 2008. As such, BLAST was the only asynchronous protocol to have entered the 1980s computing arena with all of the following features: * bit-oriented data encoding * CRC (cyclic redundancy check) error detection * a sliding window block transmission scheme * selective retransmission of corrupted blocks * simultaneous bi-directional data transfer BLAST thus gained a reputation as the protocol having the best combination of speed and reliability in its class.Smith, G. W. & Rubenstein, P. (1984). \\"The Async Route -- Best Suited for a Microcomputer's Local Traffic\\". Data Communications. History The idea for the BLAST product belongs to Paul Charbonnet, Jr., a former Data General salesman. Its original version was designed and implemented for the Data General line of Nova minicomputers by G. W. Smith, a former BorgWarner Research Center systems engineer who, having developed a basic \\"ack-nak\\" protocol for the aforesaid telemetry application, now created an entirely new protocol with all of the above-mentioned features, and for which he devised the \\"BLAST\\" acronym. This work was performed under contract to AMP Incorporated, of Baton Rouge, LA. However, it was another Baton Rouge company, Communications Research Group (CRG), which was to successfully commercialize the BLAST protocol, and which was also to employ Charbonnet and Smith as, respectively, Sales Director and Vice-president of Research and Development. On the downside, BLAST was criticized by ZMODEM developer Chuck Forsberg because of its proprietary nature, making it \\"tightly bound to the fortunes of [its supplier]\\". Communications Research Group Communications Research Group (CRG) was a Baton Rouge, Louisiana based company which became a major international vendor of data communications software during the 1980s, and which software had the BLAST protocol at its core.Held, Gilbert \\"Understanding Data Communications: From Fundamentals to Networking\\", Wiley, 1991. Honig, David A. & Hoover, Kenton A. \\"Desktop Communications: IBM PC, PS/2 & Compatibles\\", Wiley, 1990. As representative of one of CRG's mature products, the BLAST-II file transfer software was distinguished by its wide range of features. Beyond supporting the BLAST protocol, it enabled use of the competing XMODEM, encrypted and transmitted data using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and had \\"versions for about a hundred different micros, minis, and mainframes\\". Like Columbia University's Kermit software, CRG's BLAST-II also provided a scripting language. CRG was recognized as one of the 100 largest microcomputer software companies in the United States, and it was ultimately acquired by modem manufacturer U.S. Robotics in 1990, and which company continued to develop and sell BLAST products.Soft•letter Staff (April 4, 1985, Vol. 2, No. 24).

Most of them hold German and Lebanese citizenship (dual citizenship). Berlin has the largest community of Lebanese and their descendants. Other big cities with a high percentage are Essen, Bremen and Hannover Region. Mhallami =History= Mhallami are also called Mardalli, Lebanese Kurds or Kurdish Lebanese because their ancestors have lived in Mardin (a predominantly Kurdish region located in Turkey near Syrian border) or other regions in Turkey as an Arab minority. Although with the authorities they were forced to have Turkish surnames, they kept their Arab surnames in everyday life and speak Arabic. Since the 1920s, many Mhallami immigrated from Turkey to Lebanon and lived there where they bore Arab surnames. Since Lebanon Civil War, especially in the 1980s, a large number of Mhallami from Lebanon immigrated to Europe. Most of them came to Germany without any citizenship. Nevertheless they were listed under \\"Person with unknown origin\\" and not \\"stateless persons\\". =Presence= Nowadays, the majority of Lebanese Kurds have German citizenship and see themselves as Lebanese or of Lebanese descent. The largest community is in Berlin. Other cities with many Mhallami are Essen and Bremen. In recent years they have become a frequent topic in German media because almost all Kurdish clans in Germany that are known to the police to be involved in organized crime are Mhallami families. Many clans have thousands of members. Nevertheless the majority of them are not involved in crime or similar things, only some parts of the family. Examples of large Lebanese- Kurdish clans are Al-/El-Zein, Omeirat, Miri, Remmo/Rammo, Saado, Semmo, Fakhro and Ali-Khan. Palestinians =History= In the beginning of the 1970s and 1990s and especially during the Lebanon war (1975-1990) many Palestinians fled to Germany as refugees from Lebanon. While most Lebanese immigrated during the last years of the war, the biggest immigration wave of Palestinians was earlier. A lot of them had lived in refugees camps in Lebanon for some years or longer before they moved on to Germany. Palestinian immigrants usually came to Germany as stateless persons without citizenship. =Presence= Libo-Palestinians mostly see themselves as Palestinans or of Palestinian descent/heritage and not as Lebanese or of Lebanese descent. Most German Palestinians live in Berlin by far where they form the largest community of Arabs besides Lebanese. Nevetherless there are also other cities with a high percentage like Bonn and Frankfurt. =Estimates= There is no official data how many Libo-Palestinians and also Palestinians in general live in Germany. In 2017, ca. 25,000 people were stateless in GermanyStatistisches Bundesamt (Destatis): Ausländische Bevölkerung. Abgerufen am 29. November 2017. and most of them were Palestinians. Nevertheless today, the majority is not stateless any more and have German citizenship. In 2010, the number of all Palestinians living in Germany is estimated at ca. 200,000 people.

Butler was the third son of Gamaliel Butler, solicitor, and was born in Cornhill, London, England. In 1823 the family emigrated to Van Diemen's Land (later renamed Tasmania). Butler was educated in England, and chose medicine as his profession, becoming a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1843, and in 1849 a fellow of that college. After studying at some of the hospitals on the Continent, he returned to Tasmania, and began the practice of his profession in Hobart. Butler contested the seat of Brighton in the old unicameral Tasmanian Legislative Council without success in 1851, however he was elected in 1854. On the introduction of free institutions in September 1856 he entered the new Tasmanian House of Assembly (lower house) as member for Brighton, holding the seat, apart from the period from November 1862 to October 1866, until his death. In August 1869 Butler became a member of the James Wilson Ministry without portfolio. In the following October he was appointed Minister of Lands and Works, a position which he held till November 1872, when he resigned with his colleagues. He succeeded Sir Robert Officer as Speaker of the Tasmanian House of Assembly in April 1877, and having been twice re-elected in the interval, resigned in July 1885. Dr. Butler took a prominent part in educational matters. In 1853 he was appointed a member of the Central Board of Education for the colony. In 1856, when two boards were appointed, he became Chairman of the Southern Board. In 1863, shortly after the amalgamation of the two boards, he was appointed Chairman of the Central Board in succession to William Nairn. Butler had the role of Surveyor General of Tasmania (as Minister of Lands) from 1869 to 1872. As chairman he administered the educational system of the colony with ability and success until the abolition of the Board of Education in 1884 and the transference of the control of the education department to a Minister directly responsible to Parliament. Dr. Butler married Catherine Smith, daughter of Thomas Smith, of Glen Rock, Sydney. He died at Hobart on 22 August 1885.

Early life and education Boyer Brown was born in New Zealand and educated at Auckland University College where he obtained an MSc in chemistry with First Class Honours. Work =Early work= During the 1950s Brown worked in the University of Edinburgh as part of the team that developed methods for accurately measuring the metabolites of the oestrogens, progesterone and luteinising hormone in urine and, for the first time, documented the precise patterns of these hormones throughout the fertile ovulatory cycle and related these patterns of ovulation and fertility. After the war in 1947, he developed an interest in endocrinology and reproduction and started a small animal breeding surgery, set up bioassays for urinary gonadotrophins and oestrogen (the female hormone) and concluded that the most important requirement in human reproduction was the development of a highly accurate method for timing ovulation in women, similar to the phenomenon of oestrus in animals. Measurements of the oestrogens seemed to be the answer and he received a National Research Scholarship to work in Edinburgh under Professor Guy Marrian FRS, one of the discoverers of oestrogens. His aim was to develop a chemical method for measuring the oestrogens in the urine and was given a position in the newly established Clinical Endocrinology Research Unit in the University of Edinburgh, later to be appointed its Assistant Director. Notwithstanding Marrian's attempts at dissuading him from this project, Brown persisted and the essential problems were solved within a few months but a fully validated method was not published until 1955. This published paper has been cited over 1000 times and was awarded a full Citation Classic by the Institute for Scientific Information. Using this new method of measurement, Brown confirmed the elegant patterns of oestrogen production throughout the menstrual cycle which had been shown previously using labour-intensive bioassays. This work led to the award in 1952 of a Ph.D. from the University, and the Lancet requested the privilege of publishing the results obtained during the menstrual cycle, conception, pregnancy, lactation and return to fertility. His method was the \\"gold standard\\" for measuring these hormones for almost 20 years until superseded by radioimmunoassays on blood. He also collaborated with Arnold Klopper in developing a urinary Pregnanediol assay in non-pregnant women which was awarded a half Citation Classic. Possibly one of the greatest contributions made by Brown in his early days in Edinburgh was the use of human gonadotrophin for the induction of ovulation. Working with colleagues there they purified these hormones and later developed the International Standard Reference Preparation facilitating their widespread usage. The Edinburgh unit was the second in the world to use human gonadotrophins for ovulation induction in humans but Brown, later working in Melbourne, would properly rationalise their usage. Boyer Brown's interest in reproduction began in the 1940s in New Zealand when he observed the rapid progress being made in animal reproduction at the time. This progress was made possible by understanding the phenomenon of oestrus which enabled the fertile time of the animal ovarian cycle and ovulation to be determined with precision (oestrus causes the female to accept the male only at the most fertile time of the cycle). He reasoned that an equally accurate method for timing ovulation in the human would allow the same progress to be made. Furthermore, as Nature uses the interaction between oestrogen and progesterone produced by the ovaries to manifest oestrus, measurement of these hormones was the most likely method of achieving his aim. Consequently, he joined the research team in Edinburgh of Professor Guy Marrian who was one of the men who isolated and characterised the oestrogens. During the 1950s the team was successful in developing methods for accurately measuring the metabolites of the oestrogens, progesterone and luteinising hormone in urine and, for the first time, documented the precise patterns of these hormones throughout the fertile ovulatory cycle and related these patterns to ovulation and fertility. =Later work= Having established a reputation in the field, James Brown was involved in practically every major development in human reproduction since then until his retirement in 1985. He was a member of Dr Gregory Pincus's think-tank for the development of the oral contraceptive pill and performed the early work on its action. He was surprised that the pill was so quickly and universally adopted by women without an adequate study of its safety and possible long-term effects. At the same time he was pioneering work on assisted reproduction including the use of timed intercourse (as used by Nature in the phenomenon of oestrus) and clomiphene and human gonatrophin for women with deficient ovarian activity. The Swedes won the race to be the first to use human gonadotrophin but reported a startling multiple pregnancy and hyperstimulation rate. He was involved in the assessment of the oral contraceptive but in 1962 turned down an offer by Dr Geoffrey Pincus, its originator, to work with him. Instead he went to help set up the Endocrine Clinic at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, as a safe and highly effective method achieving pregnancy in anovulatory women and developed the Threshold Hypothesis of gonadothrophin action. In 1962 James Brown joined the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Melbourne. With colleagues, he developed methods for the safe use of human gonadotrophin with the minimum of multiple pregnancies, and for a time produced all the gonadotrophin for clinical use in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and parts of Canada. It was from these clinical results that he developed the incremental system of gonadotrophin therapy and propounded the threshold hypothesis of gonadotrophin action on the ovary. The threshold hypothesis explained, for the first time, how only one follicle is usually selected for ovulation in the human, but it took 20 years for the explanation to be universally accepted. The pregnancy rate achieved with gonadotrophin therapy has not been bettered. The key to this success was in mimicking the hormone patterns of the natural cycle as closely as possible, a point which is still not fully appreciated today. He continually improved the sensitivity, speed and convenience of the methods for measuring oestrogen and progesterone metabolites in urine, so that the lowest concentrations found in the human could be measured. In the early 1970s, the rest of the world changed to blood assays for monitoring ovarian and pituitary activity. The validation of these blood assays depended on demonstrating that the hormone patterns obtained were the same as those obtained by the urinary assays. During a sabbatical year in 1970, Brown gained a D.Sc. from the University of Edinburgh and delivered 63 lectures and demonstrations in Europe and the USA. In 1971 he was given a Personal Chair in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Melbourne and was a member of the IVF team led by Carl Wood. His work and understanding of ovarian function was linked to the development of the early techniques for egg pick up in IVF and were used in the first successful IVF pregnancy in Britain. During the 1970s he studied the effects of the intrauterine device on ovarian and menstrual function and was a member of the Melbourne In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) team led by Prof Carl Wood. With infertility due to anovulation now fully treatable, James Brown joined Professor Carl Wood's team which was developing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for achieving pregnancy in women with occluded fallopian tubes. During the next 7 years he provided the expertise for timing egg pick- up for IVF and also was the optimist that success would ultimately come. His methods for timing egg pick-up were also used for achieving the first IVF pregnancy in Britain. Although he is one of the \\"fathers\\" of IVF in Melbourne, he is critical of some of the bizarre applications of IVF, of some of its subsequent developments and its low pregnancy rates. Other interests include research on hormone-dependent cancers, notably cancers of the breast, endometrium and ovaries. As much time was devoted to cancer research as to reproduction. Studies were conducted during the 1950s on the effect of endocrine ablation as a treatment for breast cancer. Later, with colleagues at Harvard University, a large international study was conducted on risk factors in the development of breast cancer. This work was awarded the Prix Antoine Lacassagne from Paris in 1986 as the most important contribution to the study of breast cancer for that year. James Brown met Doctors John and Evelyn Billings in 1962 and immediately appreciated the rightness of their findings and aims. The research that followed and the way it fitted in with his other studies is described in his booklet \\"Studies in Human Reproduction\\".Brown, J.B. (2000). Studies on Human Reproduction: Ovarian Activity and Fertility and the Billings Ovulation Method. As blood is not suitable for the serial assays required for long-term monitoring of ovarian activity, particularly at home, and his laboratory was apparently the only one in the world which was able to perform the urinary assays, he spent his latter years developing the Home Ovarian Monitor. This system uses urine, was simple enough for women to measure their hormone production at home, and could be used by assisted reproduction clinics to maintain daily control of their treatments. As a final note, the quest for the equivalent of the phenomenon of oestrus in the human is now ended; it is contained in the concepts of the Basic Infertile Pattern (BIP), the oestrogen rise (ER) and the progesterone change (PC) which have come from the work of John and Lyn Billings. Accomplishments Professor James Brown published more than 220 articles in scientific journals. He was runner up in 1970 as having made the most important contributions to endocrinology in the British Commonwealth. He was the recipient of the Senior Organon Prize in 1978 and with Harvard Colleagues won the 1986 Prix Antoine Lacassagne from Paris for the most important contribution to the study of breast cancer for that year Brown retired from the University in 1985 and was accorded the title of Emeritus Professor. Nonetheless he continued to work in the field. He concentrated on simplifying the Ovarian Hormone Monitor, improving the effectiveness and acceptability of natural family planning and developing more effective methods of pregnancy achievement than IVF, for those couples who have sufficient numbers of sperm and no tubal problems. He had established in 1962, a close working and personal relationship with Drs John and Lyn Billings who developed the concept of fertility recognition through the changes in cervical mucus secretion, forming the basis of Natural Family Planning. He validated their findings and continued to work closely with them especially in his latter years when he developed the Home Ovarian Monitor – a kit that can be easily used at home even by those without any laboratory training, to check their hormonal status. This was a quantum leap from his early methods where one fully trained worker could do only 10 assays per week. Working with the Billings, the availability, simplicity and low cost of this facility enabled him to study literally hundreds of thousands of cycles in women in various stages of their reproductive lives and develop a theory of ovarian function which takes account of these findings. More than 2000 women years of experience have been accumulated with the monitor using it for both pregnancy achievement and avoidance. Right up to the time of his death Brown continued to work on various scientific projects and was involved with the World Health Organization's Special Programme of Research in Human Reproduction. Perhaps his professional life could best be summed up by a closing editorial comment made in 2003 in response to a letter he had published in Fertility and Sterility, the Journal of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine: \\"...In these days of hype, grossness and glitz, Dr Brown is a model of scientific practice who is even more imposing by the low profile that he has been able to keep over the last two decades.

Early life Jaap van Praag began his professional career working in the musical business of his father in Amsterdam, where he was born. Unlike his father, he saw great potential in the gramophone record and started his own business on the Spui downtown, called His Master's Voice. He was forced into hiding due to the persecution of Jews during World War II where he first found refuge staying with the uncle of former Ajax player Wim Schoevaart. Two and a half years later he was hiding over a photo store on the . He was forced to sit still in a chair, motionless, and not move, because the owner of the store did not even know he was there. His first wife during this time was not Jewish and did not go into hiding with him, and left him for another man during this period. The parents of Jaap van Praag and his sister were murdered in Auschwitz. After the war, he remained an active businessman in the music world. He was also active in television, and in 1962 he hosted the game show Onbekend Talent (Unknown Talent) for the VARA, which was one of the first programs that gave young talent a chance on television.

The club had just narrowly escaped relegation the previous season, so Jaap van Praag decided to hire former Ajax attacker Rinus Michels as the new head coach. Together they took the club to new professional heights, with the financial help of Maup Caransa and the Van der Meijden brothers amongst others. The Van der Meijden brothers were known to have collaborated with the Nazis during World War II, and are widely known as the bunkerbouwers (bunker builders). Jaap van Praag was legendary and admitted that he never had a difficulty lying if it was ever in the interest of his club. Famous in this respect is the statement by Johan Cruyff on Jaap van Praag, stating that he was never able to catch him in a truth. Under the guidance of Van Praag, Ajax won the European Cup three times in a row from 1971 to 1973. He was succeeded at Ajax by . In 1987 Jaap van Praag died at age 77 in a traffic accident in his hometown of Amsterdam. Cees van Cuilenborg, the then C.E.O. of Voetbal International, described the life of Jaap van Praag in his obituary as a life with a smile .  Family  Jaap van Praag had four children from two marriages. From his second marriage he had a daughter named Peggy and a son named Michael. His son Michael van Praag would later follow in his fathers footsteps and was also chairman of AFC Ajax during another very successful period at the club. His son served this function from 1989 to 2003. From his third marriage he had two daughters, Pamela and the TV host and actress Beryl van Praag. His younger brother is Max van Praag, who became a known singer. The newsreader Marga van Praag and Television presenter Chiel van Praag are his children, and Jaap van Praag is their uncle.  Name confusion  There is another Jaap van Praag, his namesake, a politician with whom he is often confused. Both were around the same age (born 1910 and 1911), both born in Amsterdam and both survived the war hiding in the city. In addition both played a role in broadcasting for the VARA.

The first school building has 3 floors, 15 classrooms and is administrated by the De La Salle Brothers. In 1977, they changed the name to La Salle Chantaburi (Mandapitak) School. Later, the school began to teach kindergarten, and built a dormitory for scholarship students who had trouble getting to school. The school set up an alumni club on 19 June 1994, and they also donated money to build school name plaque for their school. Afterwards, the school expanded to teach grades 10 to 12, constructed the De La Salle Brother's home, and built a new basketball stadium with donations from alumni. After that, the school improved the toilets, canteen, school building, park, added computer subjects, and constructed a new kindergarten building.

For centuries it housed a monastic settlement, and more recently an asylum. It is now the site of a luxury hotel. Location San Clemente Island lies in the Venetian Lagoon between Giudecca and the Lido. The island covers 6 hectares (15 acres), of which 1.34 is edified. History The island was first settled in 1131, when Venetian merchant Pietro Gattilesso funded the construction of the church of San Clemente and a hospice for pilgrims and soldiers destined for the Holy Land. The name is dedicated to Pope Clement I, who died as a martyr according to legend and who is patron of seamen. The complex was run by Augustine canons, while the entire island was under the jurisdiction of the patriarch of Grado Enrico Dandolo. In 1288 the relics of Saint Anianus - the first successors of St. Mark as Patriarch of Alexandria - were brought to the San Clemente church. After experiencing a slow decline in the course of the 14th century, San Clemente gained fresh life in 1432, when Pope Eugene IV moved the order of Lateran canons - also known as the Charity (Carità) - to the island. Thanks to donations provided by wealthy Venetian families, the canons began work on the restoration of the church and enlargement of the monastery. In 1643, to fulfil a vow made during the plague epidemic that struck the city in 1630, Venetians funded the building of a new chapel, modelled on the Holy House of Loreto, inside the San Clemente church. This “church in a church” is still a main feature of the construction. Camaldolese Hermits of Monte Corona purchased the island in 1645. The Venetian nobility provided them with financial assistance to restore the church and monastery, and expand the island to add additional houses to the complex. In 1652 the Morosini family sponsored the restoration of the church façade by Andrea Cominelli, in order to pay tribute to the family's members Francesco and Tommaso, who died in the War of Candia. The fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797 impacted San Clemente. Also, owing to the suppression of religious orders by Napoleon, in 1810 the Camaldolese monks left the island, which became a military garrison. From 1844 the island housed a mental hospital, illustrating the 'confinement of the mad' and their exclusion from society common to the period. This female asylum housed women of Venice who were considered insane, earning a reputation amongst Venetians who in time equated 'going to San Clemente' with going mad, much in the way 'Bedlam' has been referred to within England. According to historian Andrew Scull, Mussolini sent his first wife Ida Dalser to San Clemente, effectively incarcerating her. The asylum was abandoned in 1992 before being bought and developed into the hotel complex it houses today.Scull, Andrew, Madness in Civilization: a Cultural History of Insanity (Thames & Hudson, 2015) Gateway to Venice Between the 15th and 16th centuries, San Clemente became known as the “gateway to Venice”. It became standard practice to take the Bucentaur (Bucintoro), the Doge's ceremonial barge, to the island to meet distinguished visitors. On the return journey to the Grand Canal, the guests were entertained by a variety of spectacles and performances. Writing of Venice in 1493, Marino Sanudo described the Bucentaur as “a marvel, in which the Prince and Senate go to any great lord visiting the city; they go to San Clemente or elsewhere, depending on the direction from which the visitor is coming”. Hotel The buildings on the private island were renovated in 2003 and converted into a luxury hotel. In September 2013 it was announced that a subsidiary of the Permak construction group of Turkey had bought the property. Permak launched further renovations between 2013 and 2014, while retaining the historic character. The property is currently managed by Kempinski Group, which reopened the hotel as San Clemente Palace Kempinski in March 2016. The hotel has 190 rooms and suites, three restaurants and three bars, an outdoor swimming pool and a tennis court as well as a golf pitching course.

It is the successor to the Honda Beat (segment-wise), and the Honda S2000 (nomenclature-wise, as it also belongs to Honda's family of \\"S\\" models). Overview The S660 is a very lightweight mid-engined roadster. It shares a platform with the Honda N-One and uses the same 656 cc S07A engine with mechanical improvements. Its dimensions, due to kei car size restrictions, are nearly identical to the 1990s Honda Beat. It is sold with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a CVT with paddle shifters, both options being offered on the two trims available (Alpha and Beta). The S660 weighs approximately 830 kg with the manual transmission and 850 kg with the CVT, and is claimed to have a front/rear weight balance of 45/55. The naming convention of using the letter \\"S\\" followed by the engine displacement is a long-held Honda tradition going back to Honda's second production car, the Honda S500 (from which the S660 draws inspiration).  Performance  The S660 is powered by the same turbocharged 656 cc S07A 3-cylinder engine used in the Honda N-One with some mechanical improvements. In the S660 this engine is mid- mounted and produces at 6000 rpm and of torque at 2600 rpm with a redline of 7700 rpm for the manual transmission and 7000 rpm for the CVT. This gives the S660 a 0-60 mph (97 km/h) time of upwards of 10 seconds, with Car and Driver magazine estimating it to be between 13.2 and 13.6 seconds, and a top speed of .  Development and launch  left alt= Rear view A prototype was shown at the November 2013 Tokyo Motor Show. The prototype and proposed production announcement were widely covered in auto enthusiast news sites and blogs. Initial reactions to the concept were favorable. After the S660 entered the market, its first driving review was in June 2015 of a Japanese-market prototype driven by Top Gear in Tokyo. The author concluded that the car was \\"supremely maneuverable\\" but lacked power, something he hoped an export model with a larger motor would amend, and felt that such an export model might be a potential Mazda MX-5 competitor. = First photographs = The prototype S660 was photographed by car enthusiasts at a wintertime car event in early 2015 and published in the Japanese car enthusiast magazine Mag-X, and subsequently republished in the US car blog The Truth About Cars. The pictures included several exterior photos and one of the opened engine compartment. = Production = The development team of the S660 was led by Ryo Mukumoto, who beat out 400 other participants in Honda's in-house competition at the age of 22. Honda made him the youngest lead engineer in the company's history in spite of his lack of engineering experience, and he was given 5 years to develop the S660. Honda Motor Co. president Takanobu Ito stated that the S660 was planned for production in 2015. American Honda Motor Co. president Tetsuo Iwamura was quoted as saying \\"I would personally fight for it,\\" to come to the United States if the US market asked for it.

The group began in Colchester, Essex, in 1963 as 'Dane Stephens and the Deep Beats'. After a year, the band evolved into 'The Fairies' - Dane Stephens (born Douglas Robert Ord, vocals/blues harp), John 'Akky' Acutt (lead guitar, ex-the Strangers), Mick 'Wimps' Weaver (rhythm guitar/fiddle - not the same-named organ player also known as Wynder K Frog), John Frederick 'Freddy' Gandy (bass) and John 'Twink' Alder (drums, ex-the Strangers). In late 1964 the Fairies recorded the single \\"Don't Think Twice It's Alright\\" for the Decca Records label. Around the same time, the band made newspaper headlines when members were arrested for climbing up a statue. Twink later recalled: > \\"With Dane Stephens, our shows were not only blues but soul numbers, touches > of jazz as well. He was an amazing singer, very very special. Had a great > voice, played amazing blues harp, the Fairies were just about to break big.\\" > \\"Dane Stephens was involved in an accident while he was driving the group > van - without any licence or insurance.

We had been actually about to break > at that point, there was no doubt about it. We had Mickie Most producing us > in the studio, we had a single out and another one on the way, an agent who > was getting us booked back again everywhere - we were good, a really good > R&B; band.\\" In 1965, after Wymer replaced Stephens as singer, they recorded two more singles, \\"Get Yourself Home\\" and \\"Don't Mind\\", for HMV. \\"Get Yourself Home\\" was written by Johnnie Dee, road manager for the Fairies, but rejected by the Pretty Things and recorded by the Fairies instead; previously, Dee's song \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" had been rejected by the Fairies but became a hit for the Pretty Things in 1964. Twink: \\"We became like the Pretty Things when Nik Wymer came along - mostly because Nik looked and sounded so much like Phil May... and then after [Dane Stephens] came out Nik left and we got Dane back but we were really trying to recreate something which we'd already lost.\\" Nik Wymer briefly joined an embryonic group formed by ex-members of Them in late 1965. Brian 'Smudger' Smith from Watford R&B; band 'Cops 'n' Robbers' may have sung with the band at some point, as Dane Stephens reportedly swapped to become Cops 'n' Robbers singer around late 1965 and possibly sang on their final single \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\".The R&B; Scene liner notes, Deram Records The Fairies split at some date before 1967, Twink having already departed and joined London band the In-Crowd in August 1966. This band evolved into Tomorrow, and from there Twink joined the Pretty Things and the Pink Fairies before launching a solo career. Dane Stephens recorded under the pseudonym 'Zion De Gallier' for Tomorrow producer Mark Wirtz. Freddie Gandy joined Bluesology alongside Long John Baldry, Elton Dean and Reggie Dwight (Elton John), followed by a late line-up of Sam Gopal in 1969 and Hookfoot in the early 1970s. Twink reunited with Stephens and Weaver on his 1991 album Odds & Beginnings, which included the tracks \\"Anytime At All\\", \\"Don’t Bring Me Down\\", \\"Get Yourself Home\\" and \\"Boot Black\\".

The original Portuguese fort is shown in the bottom left. Looking past the ruins of the Portuguese- built Kastella towards Ternate's Gamalama volcano, from 2012 Fort Kastela () is a ruined fortress located at the southwest coast of Ternate. It is famous for being the first colonial fortification constructed in the Spice Islands (Maluku) of Indonesia. Built by the Portuguese in 1522, it is also referred to in different languages as São João Baptista de Ternate or Fortaleza de Ternate (Portuguese), Ciudad del Rosario (Spanish) or Gammalamma (Ternatean and Dutch). Today it is locally known as Kastella/Kastela. In April 1521, a fleet was dispatched by King Manuel I of Portugal from Lisbon under the command of Jorge de Brito. The fleet was given orders to intercept the Spanish fleet of Ferdinand Magellan while sailing towards the Spice Islands from the Americas. Upon making landfall, they were ordered to construct a fortress on Ternate and to establish the Portuguese pre-eminence in the region. The initial fort was named by the Portuguese after Saint John the Baptist, on whose feast day the first stone was laid in 1522. It was completed in 1523. The location selected was on the south-west coast of Ternate, near the Sultan's Court, but 7 km from the island's main reef-free harbor at Talangame. Kastella commanded three narrow passages through the encircling reefs, which allowed small crafts to arrive for loading cloves, but prevented larger vessels from closing sufficiently to bombard. Several subsequent visitors described the fort as incomplete, and it was not until the governorship of António Galvão, commencing in 1536, that the defenses were improved significantly. After killing Ternate's Sultan Hairun in 1570, the Portuguese were besieged in their fort by forces of the new Sultan Baab for five years. In 1575, they handed over the fort and retreated to Ambon. Sultan Baab occupied the fort, renamed it as Gammalamma and converted it into his royal palace. Anticipating a Portuguese return, Sultan Baab extensively modified the defenses into a substantial fortress, and constructed an additional fort 5 km to the east, known today as Fort Kota Janji. In 1605, the newly arrived Dutch VOC captured Portuguese forts on Ambon and Tidore and established a trading base on Ternate. The Spanish (in a personal union with Portugal since 1580) dispatched a strong expedition from the Philippines and recaptured Kastella, taking hostage Sultan Saidi Berkat and exiling him to Manila in March 1606. They further modified the Gammalamma defenses into a powerful fortress and renamed it as Ciudad del Rosario. Dutch Admiral Paulus van Caerden, captured by the Spanish in 1610 and held in Kastella, regarded it as \\"invulnerable.\\" When the Spanish departed from the Spice Islands in 1663, they partially destroyed the defenses which were then occupied by the Dutch.

The smallest one can be only 2 centimeters tall. It is gradually created from soil through the process of baking and painting until it becomes a beautiful doll used to decorate a room. It also represents Thai culture. The name \\"doll of the palace women\\" derives from its original version of this doll that was first created among the women in the Grand palace of Thailand a century ago.  History  There are two assumptions about its sources. The first assumption mentions that the doll was originally created by the women working in the palace and another story tells that one royal family woman made it for the little princess. Although its real source has not been clarified yet, both stories show that it came from the royal palace around the period of Rama 4th and 5th (around 1851–1910). After the first introduction of the doll, it became popular among the women in the palace of that period. The last person who made the original version of this doll is “นางแฉ่ง สังคาวาสี” (Mrs. Chang Sungkawasri). She and her sisters were the ones who brought the royal doll from the palace to the ordinary people and made it known by first selling it at a popular fair in the capital part of Thailand. Unfortunately, after a long period, the art of this doll gradually disappeared. However, there was a revival of the royal doll. Hoping to conserve this tiny doll, Queen Sirikit raised this issue and let the villagers of Bang Sadej area, which is in Angthong province, revive the art in 1976. When it came to a doll of villagers, the old original dolls were carried on and the new villager style is developed.  Characteristics  There are two main styles of the doll, a royal original look and the villagers’ folk style. The primary style in the grand palace were applied from the tender character, the real traditional activities and the lifestyle of the women in the palace, such as the posture these women did to show the respect to the royal family or the colors of the clothes they wore, so the doll looks rather delicate. On the other side, the characteristic of the folk style gives a more local and strong feeling because it represented the villagers’ lives, such as the posture of the children playing the local game. Even though there are some differences in characteristics and the method of creating changed as the time passed, both styles have more value than just a value of dolls for decoration as they contain historical story and culture of Thailand, which can reflect the social situation and way of life in each period.

Traditionally, namtan pan was usually made and sold at Chinese opera theatres by Teochew immigrants, who may have introduced the sweet into Thailand. The vendors would use a foldaway tool set consisting of a working bench, pots and stove to make and sell their products.

On 18 March 1900 they first registered the club officially as the Amsterdamsche Football Club Ajax of which Floris Stempel was the first chairman in the club's history. The first friendly match on 20 March 1900 was organized under his guidance against cross town Amsterdamsche Football Club, with Ajax losing their first ever match 6–1 since officially becoming a club. The first official match for Ajax took place on 29 September 1900 against DOSB, which Ajax won 2–1. In 1902 Floris Stempel was responsible for the admission of AFC Ajax into the Royal Dutch Football Association. Stempel remained the chairman of the club until 1908, and was relieved of his duties by his friend and co-founder Chris C. Holst. At some time between 23 January and 16 March 1910, Floris Stempel died. He was on board the SS Prins Willem II of the Royal West Indian Mail Service (KWIM) on his way to Paramaribo, Suriname, but after the ship passed Ushant on 23 January, there was no more communication with the ship and its 54 passengers.

Web.] These organisms represent some of the few organisms outside of Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants) and Isoptera (termites) that exhibit eusociality. Eusocial insects are animals that develop large, multigenerational cooperative societies that assist each other in the rearing of young, often at the cost of an individual’s life or reproductive ability. Such altruism is explained in that eusocial insects benefit from giving up reproductive ability of many individuals to improve the overall fitness of closely related offspring. In order for an animal to be considered eusocial, it must satisfy the three criteria defined by E. O Wilson.Wilson, E. O. 1971: The insect societies. — Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Cambridge. Massachusetts. The first criterion is that the species must have reproductive division of labor. Gall thrips have separate castes of reproductive macropterous (fully winged) females, some micropterous reproductive males, and many micropterous non-reproductive females. The second criterion requires that the group has overlapping generations, a phenomenon found in these gall thrips.Gadagkar, Raghavendra (1993). \\"And now... eusocial thrips!\\". Current Science 64 (4): 215–216. Finally, gall thrips participate in cooperative brood care by the soldiers who protect the developing larva. This is the final criterion for eusociality. =Social structure= Macropterous, inseminated females initiate gall formation on the [petiolephyllodes] of Acacia trees using their mouthparts. What follows is frequent fighting between inseminated females for ownership of the forming gall. The foundress female then lays her eggs and feeds on the phyllodes until her brood hatches and ecloses. Micropterous adults eclose first, with about a 4:1 female to male sex ratio bias. Macropterous larvae, micropterous pupae and eggs are also present. These macropterous larvae, when they eclose, mate and disperse from the gall, though some may breed for a short time into the next generation in the gall where they eclosed. Micropterous individuals are armed with large barbed forelegs for defending against attacking organisms. These individuals, often defined as soldiers, react to ruptures in the gall by swarming the opening, waiting and patrolling the area for some time, until the opening closes. It has been shown that when presented with Koptothrips (a parasitic thrips species) and other variety of extra-specific insects, the micropterous gall thrips will attack and often kill the would-be invader. In gall thrips, brood care is essentially role reversed. Thrips young are not helpless, and can immediately begin to provide for itself and to a certain extent the related individuals around them, while the soldier adults stay busy patrolling the gall for possible incursions. Thus, the brood cares for the adults.Hunt, James H. \\"Behavioral Ecology.\\" The Evolution of Social Wasps. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2007. N. pag. Print. =Evolution of eusociality= The gall thrips represent a unique organism for studying the evolution and origins of eusociality, given that they are not a member of Hymenoptera or Isoptera. Another useful factor that contributes to the use of these organisms for research into eusociality is a well-defined phylogenetic tree and access to large amounts of genetic data.[ Chapman, Thomas W., and Bernard J. Crespi. \\"The Evolution of Soldier Reproduction in Social Thrips.\\" Behavioral Ecology 13.4 (2001): 519-25. Oxford Journals. Oxford Journals, Nov.-Dec. 2001. Web.] High relatedness of individuals within a given colony as well as haplodiploidy have been cited as heavy contributing factors to the success of eusocial insects. Gall thrips are in fact haplodiploid, meaning that most offspring (in this case the micropterous offspring) are haploid, where the parent was a diploid organism. This causes a greater-than-expected sister-sister relatedness of 0.75 and has been proposed as a theory for why eusociality has evolved, particularly in Hymenoptera.Hamilton, W. D. (20). \\"The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour II\\". Journal of Theoretical Biology 7 (1): 17–52. doi:10.1016/0022-5193(64)90039-6. . Retrieved 13 November 2012. Gall thrips, however, actually exhibit not only high relatedness between sisters, but also between brother-sister, a departure from the results typical of other haplodiploid eusocial insects. This has been found to be a result of large amounts of inbreeding within a single gall. This inbreeding has been proposed to have reduced the haploidy-induced relatedness symmetries, and also allowed for an explanation of biparental care among thrips, where both males and females participate in defense of the gall. The benefit from altruistic behavior occurs in two ecological modes: \\"life insurers\\" as found in social Hymenoptera, and \\"fortress defenders\\".[Queller, David C., and Joan E. Strassmann. \\"Kin Selection and Social Insects.\\"BioScience 48.3 (1998): 165. Print.] The fortress defender model leads to the evolution of eusociality when three criteria are met: food coinciding with shelter, selection for defense against intruders and predators, and the ability to defend such a habitat.Crespi, B. J. \\"Three Conditions for the Evolution of Eusociality: Are They Sufficient?\\"Insectes Sociaux 41.4 (1994): 395-400. Print. Eusocial thrips appear to satisfy these requirements. Gall thrips maintain galls around Acacia phyllodes, a singular and vast resource for them, satisfying the first criterion. The prevalence of other, aggressive, parasitic thrips species (Koptothrips) with known instances of hostile takeover and killing of gall thrips indicates strong selection for defense. The final criterion is satisfied by soldier micropterous thrips with large barbed forelegs that assist them in defending against episodic attacks. Fortress defenders may have developed soldier caste individuals before any other specialization, given the high selective value of protecting the fortress. Perhaps the most compelling evidence, therefore, is the progressive differentiation of soldier caste thrips in Kladothrips, where soldier-to-foundress reproductive allocation corresponds to eusocial life history traits in basal and derived species of a well mapped phylogenetic tree.Kranz, Brenda D., (2005), Egg size and reproductive allocation in eusocial thrips, Behavioral Ecology, 16, issue 4, p. 779-787.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 24, 2013. It was written by Tim Long and directed by Mark Kirkland. In the episode, Lisa makes friends with a new girl in school, who turns out to be a conservative Republican (a George W. Bush one rather than an Abraham Lincoln or Ronald Reagan one) with connections to Springfield's Republican Party. Plot Lisa befriends a new student named Isabel Gutierrez. She is thrilled until Isabel reveals that she is a Republican (and to make matters worse, when Lisa asks her if she is a Lincoln or a Reagan Republican or even a George H.W. Bush Republican, Isabel says no). The two girls end up running against each other for class president, and the Springfield Republican Party tells Isabel they are thrilled with her decision and want to offer their services, as she is the kind of Latina voter the GOP will need in the future. However, Isabel tells them to butt out, because she is not going to be \\"owned\\" by them. The GOP decides to use some dirty tricks anyway, and Lisa is angry with Isabel when she thinks her classmate supported the actions, but respects her when she learns the local GOP people are just acting like jerks. In a class debate, Lisa tells the assembled students that if believing that those with a lot should help those with nothing makes her a liberal, then yes, she is a liberal and proud of it. At the final debate, the two walk away from their podia and Isabel says they want to set aside politics and would be happy for whichever of them wins, Lisa goes to say the same, and is cut off by Superintendent Chalmers, saying they are out of time. The election goes to Isabel in a close vote, but Lisa is extremely heartened by an exit poll that reveals 53% of the students agree with her views; she says that this means they do not like her, but would vote for someone who shares her ideas, and that is a happy end result. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B–, saying \\"If there’s a bigger flaw with ‘The Kid Is All Right,’ it's that it's just not very funny. Longoria brings nothing to the table, and there's a dearth of quotable lines along the way. (Skinner's glee at seeing Lisa “thoroughly de-high-horsed” notwithstanding.) For most of its running time (there's no B-story), the episode seems content to let Lisa learn (and teach) a lesson in plain old Lisa Simpson decency, and I was strangely okay with that. As ever, Yeardley Smith imbues Lisa with genuine heart. Taking time out from its accelerating descent into gag-driven wackiness to engage in more character-based storytelling isn't necessarily a bad thing for The Simpsons.\\" The episode received a 3.0 rating and was watched by a total of 6.78 million people, making it the most watched show on Animation Domination that night.

Stanford University, n.d. Web. November 21, 2013. . He is currently a professor at Stanford University, and received the National Humanities Medal from President Barack Obama in 2012. Biography =Early life and education= Saldívar grew up in Brownsville, Texas, a town on the Mexico-United States border. Saldívar said in an interview that \\"From downtown Brownsville, you can literally look across the river and, a hundred yards away or so, there's Mexico. To me, growing up, that was always normal life, that was the way the world worked: bilingual, binational, transcultural in all sorts of ways.\\" He was raised in a Spanish speaking household, learning English only after entering school. He graduated from Brownsville High School in 1968, and pursued undergraduate studies at the University of Texas, Austin. Saldívar briefly considered a career in law or a return to Texas' Rio Grande Valley, but ultimately earned a degree in comparative literature and graduated with highest honors, and a membership in the Phi Beta Kappa Society. He went on to earn a Master of Philosophy from Yale University in 1975 and a Ph.D two years later. =Career at Stanford= After graduating from Yale, Saldívar spent 15 years teaching at UT Austin before accepting a position at Stanford in 1991. He has been a professor of English and Comparative Literature there for the past 22 years. Saldívar acted as Stanford's Associate Dean and Vice-Provost for Undergraduate Studies from 1994 to 1999, and worked as a Milligan Family University Fellow in Undergraduate Education from 2002 to 2012. He is currently the director of Stanford's Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity. Saldívar's lectures cover topics in literary criticism and theory, the history of the novel, 19th and 20th-century literature, cultural studies, globalization and transnationalism, and Chicano/a studies. In February 2012, Saldívar was one of nine scholars honored with a National Humanities Medal by United States President Barack Obama. After receiving the medal, Saldívar said he was both \\"completely blown away and deeply moved by the honor.\\" =Books= Saldívar has written three books, the first of which, Figural Language in the Novel: The Flowers of Speech from Cervantes to Joyce, was published in 1984. In Figural Language in the Novel, Saldívar states that a narrator's primary duty is to employ a grammar and syntax for communicating both surreal and realistic experiences. Saldívar's second book, Chicano Narrative: The Dialectics of Difference, was released in 1990 and focused on the struggle of Mexican- American authors to maintain cultural identity throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, a struggle which the author felt had been neglected in the study of American literature. His most recent book, The Borderlands of Culture: Américo Paredes and the Transnational Imaginary, focuses on Mexican-American scholar Américo Paredes and his contributions to the discourse of cultural studies in the U.S. Saldívar details a history of Paredes' career in writing about the American southwestern borderlands, and presents Paredes as being among the founders of a new kind of cultural studies in America concerned with the Mexico-United States border and its social and historical significance. The book was published by Duke University Press in 2006, seven years after Paredes died. Theories and criticism Saldívar points out that unlike most ethnic immigrants in the United States, Mexican Americans became an ethnic minority through the direct conquest of their homelands. This change in legal status resulted in the slow development of a unique culture that was distinct from both Mexican and mainstream American Culture.Saldívar, Ramón (1990), Chicano Narrative: The Dialectics of Difference, Madison, Wisconsin: The University of Wisconsin Press, A focus of Saldívar's work is the idea that Chicano literature has been relegated to ethnic studies more than it deserves. Saldívar believes that it should instead be considered American literature. \\"Works by Mexican-American authors are absent from the American literary histories, the anthologies of American literature, and from the syllabi of courses on American literature. Spanish departments in American universities have also participated in this strategy of exclusion,\\" he says.Calderón, Hectór, and José David Saldívar. Criticism in the borderlands: studies in Chicano literature, culture, and ideology. Durham: Duke University Press, 1991. \\"This exclusion is by no means innocent.\\" Much of that theory, presented in his book Chicano Narrative, has been met with support from other academics. Maria A. Beltran states in Vocal and American Literature that \\"Saldívar provides the reader with a more modern, challenging, and sophisticated critical view of Mexican-American literature.\\"The University of Wisconsin Press, \\"Chicano Narrative: The Dialects of Difference.\\" Last modified December 15, 2011.

His book may shock those who still deny that Chicano literature must be included in the teaching of Hispanic and American literature in U.S. colleges and universities, for he strives to demonstrate that, through their works, Chicano authors represent and are part of an American reality that can no longer be ignored.\\" Hector A. Torres of College Literature called Chicano Narrative \\"a monumental work on the scene of Chicano/a literary criticism.\\" José E. Limón, in American Literary History, criticized Saldívar's philosophy of Chicano/American integration and the existence of a defined dialectic, that Saldívar described in The Borderlands of Culture \\"Saldívar seems too determined to create such a substantial East–West, truly transnational Duboisian figure in Paredes when the available evidence would seem rather to suggest a Mexican-American intellectual of high achievement in two relatively discrete spheres,\\" he writes.Limón, José E. In Imagining the Imaginary: A Reply to Ramon Saldívar. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 2009. 595-603. Personal life Saldívar has seven siblings, two of which have also gone on to become professors of literature. His brother, José, teaches at Stanford and his sister Sonia Saldívar-Hull teaches at the University of Texas San Antonio. Saldívar has said that Walt Whitman is his favorite poet, and believes that the contradictions and multitudes he presents in his poetry are similar to the themes used in Chicano literature. Saldívar grew up a self- proclaimed fan of Davy Crockett, but was conflicted when he found out that his hero fought against Mexican forces.Sanford, John. \\"For Professor Ramón Saldívar, family history shapes identity.\\" Stanford.edu. http://news.stanford.edu/news/2002/march13/whatmatterssaldivar-313.html References 1949 births Living people American people of Mexican descent Stanford University faculty University of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts alumni Yale University alumni American male writers National Humanities Medal recipients Chicano Chicano literature ","title":"Ramón Saldívar"},{"id":"41155976","text":"Qurikancha museum marker graphically explaining the Inca system of wak'as and siq'is Qurikancha museum marker describing the Inca system of wak'as and siq'is The ceque (Quechua: siq'i, ) system was a series of ritual pathways leading outward from Cusco into the rest of the Inca Empire.Farrington (1992 p. 370)D'Altroy 2003 (p. 155) The empire was divided into four sections called suyus. In fact, the local name for the empire was \\"Tawantinsuyu,\\" meaning \\"four parts together.\\" Cusco, the capital, was the center and meeting point of these four sections, which converged at Qurikancha, the temple of the sun. Cusco was split in half, Hanansaya to the north and Hurinsaya to the south, with each half containing two of the four suyus. Hanansaya contained Chinchaysuyu in the northwest and Antisuyu in the northeast while Hurinsaya contained Qullasuyu in the southeast and Kuntisuyu in the southwest.Bauer 1992 (p. 184) Each region contained 9 lines, except for the Kuntisuyu, which had 14 or 15.D'Altroy 2003 (p. 162) Thus a total of 41 or 42 known pathways radiated out from the Qurikancha or sun temple in Cusco, leading to shrines or wak'as of religious and ceremonial significance.D'Altroy 2003 (p. 155-163)  Wak'as  Wak'as were spots of ceremonial, ritual, or religious significance arranged along pathways called siq'is. Some wak'as were natural features, such as springs, boulders, or caves, while others were man-made features like buildings, fountains, or canals. The number of wak'as on each line varied, typically from 3 to 13 or more per siq'i. Certain people from specific kin groups were designated as caretakers for each wak'a.Bauer 1992 (p. 185)  Organization  The siq'i lines originate at the Qurikancha and travel, in relatively straight pathways, to the edges of the land added to the Inca empire by Pachakuti.Farrington 1992 (p. 370) Four of the lines correspond to four main branches of the Inca road system.Bauer 1992 (p. 183) Every line was tended to by a particular social group, and the line's character was determined by the wak'as that fell along its path and what could be sacrificed there, calendric and astronomical events associated with it, and sometimes a description of the environment it passed through. The location of the wak'as appears to dictate the path of the siq'i line, not the other way around.Bauer 1992 (p. 187) Siq'is may be relatively straight or have segments that are straight, but the paths frequently curve or zigzag.Bauer 1992 (p. 202) However, siq'i lines do not generally cross over one another.Bauer 1992 (p. 201) The lines are also thought to show the social and political organization of Cusco, specifically the Inca and non-Inca ayllu groups and where the border of each group's territory lies. The siq'i lines often follow springs or canals, which were naturally occurring markers of irrigation districts.Farrington 1992 (p. 370-373)  Siq'i lines and ritual  Some aspects of the siq'i system remain unclear. R. Tom Zuidema has theorized that the wak'as may be related to Incan understanding of astronomy. The Inca followed a synodic lunar calendar (time was measured in phases of the moon). They observed periodic calendrical rituals celebrating events such as solstices, and different centers were used for different astronomical events.Zuidema 168-169. As an extension of this theory, Zuidema proposed that each of the 328 wak'as may represent one day in the year, the time for the Moon to complete 12 circuits, and that some of the siq'is were used for astronomical sight lines.Bauer 1992 187-202.

(1580?–1641) was a Scottish Calvinist minister, a pastor in France and London. Gilbert Primrose Life Born about 1580 into a Perthshire family, he was son of Gilbert Primrose, principal surgeon to James VI of Scotland, and Alison Graham, his wife. He was educated at St. Andrews University, where he took the degree of M.A. He then went to France, and was received as a minister of the Reformed Church there. His first charge was at Mirambeau, from which he was transferred in 1603 to the church of Bordeaux. His influence helped John Cameron become regent in the new college of Bergerac. The Synod of Rochelle (March 1607) of the French Reformed Church, sent Primrose to John Welsh of Ayr, and other banished Scots ministers who had been banished, to offer financial support. At the synod Primrose presented letters from King James and from the magistrates and ministers of Edinburgh, recalling him home to serve the church in that city; but he was induced to remain in Bordeaux. later in 1607 he visited Britain, and was commissioned by the Reformed congregation at Rochelle to ask King James to set at liberty Andrew Melville from the Tower of London, and to allow him to accept a professorship in their college. The request was refused, and the application gave offence to the French court. On his return Primrose was called before Henry IV of France, and the people of Rochelle were reprimanded for communicating with a foreign sovereign without the knowledge or consent of their own. In 1608 John Cameron became Primrose's colleague at Bordeaux, and they were on good terms for ten years, when Cameron left for a professorship at Saumur Academy. At the end of 1615 and beginning of 1616 the church at Bordeaux was closed by government pressure, and its ministers were sent away to insure their safety; they were recalled when matters became more settled. In 1623 an act was passed forbidding ministers of other nations to officiate in France, and at Synod of Charenton in September of that year the royal commissioner presented letters from the French king stating that Primrose and Cameron were no longer to be employed, for reasons of state. After deputies were sent to Louis XIII to intercede on their behalf, Primrose was obliged to leave the country. In London, Primrose was chosen one of the ministers of the French Protestant Church of London, an appointment which he held till his death; and he was also made chaplain in ordinary to James I. On 18 January 1625 he was incorporated in the University of Oxford, receiving the degree of D.D. on the same day on the recommendation of the king. Four years later he became a canon of Windsor. Primrose died in London in October or November 1642. Works Primrose's published works were: * Le vœu de Jacob opposé aux vœux de Moines, 4 vols., Bergerac, 1610; translated into English by John Bultiel, London, 1617. * La Trompette de Sion (18 sermons), Bergerac, 1610; a Latin edition was published at Danzig in 1631. * La Defense de la Religion Reformée, Bergerac, 1619. * Panegyrique à très grand et très puissant Prince Charles, Prince de Galles, Paris, 1624. * The Christian Man's Tears and Christ's Comforts, London, 1625. * Nine Sermons, London, 1625. * The Table of the Lord, London, 1626. Family Primrose married three times, his first wife being Elizabeth Brenin who died in 1637, his second Jeanne Hersent, widow of Abraham Aurelius (died 1641), and the third Louise de Lobel, widow of Jacob Cool.

The essay forms the ninth chapter of Dialectics of Nature, which proposes a unitary materialist paradigm of natural and human history. Description Though incomplete, the essay elucidates two aspects of materialist theory which had underpinned Marx and Engels’s thinking since the mid-1840s. First, it argues that humanity’s separation from nature is not inherent to the human condition, but rather that humanity is a part of nature; furthermore, human agency in physically reorganizing nature is part of a long historical process, whereby the physical material of nature is incorporated into human systems of value through labour. Engels uses this framework to suggest that humanity must transcend the ecologically destructive patterns of capitalism, and progress to a mode of production that operates in harmony with nature. Secondly, the essay confronts the question of cognition and ontology, suggesting that the human brain is not inherently distinct from the brains of other mammals, but that human intellectual capabilities developed through a dialectical relationship with the human body. Specifically, Engels emphasizes the importance of humans’ opposable thumbs and phonetically dynamic mouths, which enabled them to articulate complex forms of language over time. In that respect, the essay challenged the prevailing philosophy of Cartesian dualism, which drew a stark division between mind and body. Marx and Engels had both alluded to this notion in previous writings, for instance in their first collaborative work, The Holy Family, in which they wrote, “Body, being, substance are but different terms for the same reality. It is impossible to separate thought from matter that thinks.”http://www.marxists.org/subject/dialectics/marx-engels/holy-family.htm However, in describing this dynamic as a function of the historical process of evolution, the essay is among the most explicit and comprehensive documents on the ontology of Marx and Engels.  Summary  Engels begins by stating that labour is not only the fundamental source of wealth and value, but that it represents the “basic condition for all human existence,” in the sense that the human mind and body have been produced by the historical process of labour. He suggests that “labour begins with the making of tools,” and therefore the first essential moment in this history was the development of bipedalism, which freed the hominids’ hands to become more dexterous and capable of crafting rudimentary implements. Thus he emphasizes that “the hand is not only the organ of labour, it is also the product of labour.” As subsistence moved beyond basic foraging, so too did hominids' methods of collaboration and need for mutual support. “In short,” wrote Engels, “men in the making arrived at a point where they had something to say to each other. … The undeveloped larynx of the ape was slowly but surely transformed…and the organs of the mouth gradually learned to produce one articulate sound after another.” Concomitantly, the hominids underwent a process of adaptation encompassing a change in their diets that allowed them to inhabit new environments. Fishing and hunting with the assistance of crafted tools were an essential part of this process, because, although often time-consuming, they provided a rich source of protein that helped nourish their bodies and their physical brains. Engels suggests that the subsequent major developments following from the development of the meat diet were the control of fire, and the domestication of animals. Then, finally, they reach a point at which they are capable of developing the institutions associated with human civilization: “Agriculture was added to hunting and cattle raising; then came spinning, weaving, metalworking, pottery, and navigation. Along with trade and industry, art and science finally appeared. Tribes developed into nations and states.” Engels asserts that humans have thus become distinguished from animals by their ability to manipulate nature in manifold and dynamic ways, as opposed to fitting into a singular ecological niche. He notes that “whole continents” have been reconfigured through human industry, and that even plants and animals themselves have been transformed by selective breeding to the extent “that they become unrecognizable.” However, he cautions against the conceptualization of nature as standing in opposition to humanity in any sense, writing, “Let us not flatter ourselves overmuch on account of our human victories over nature. For each such victory nature takes its revenge on us.” He notes the desertification provoked by deforestation in Asia Minor and Greece, and that in many places in Europe the monocrop cultivation of the potato may have led to the proliferation of scrofula, as well as the Great Famine of Ireland. “Thus at every step we are reminded that we by no means rule over nature like a conqueror over a foreign people, like someone standing outside nature – but that we, with flesh, blood and brain, belong to nature, and exist in its midst, and that all our mastery of it consists in the fact that we have the advantage over all other creatures of being able to learn its laws and apply them correctly.”  Relevance to Marxist thought  The conceptual unity of humanity and nature had been a central theme in Marx and Engels’s thought from the early stages of their careers, and was especially prevalent in their discourses on species-being. For instance, in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, Marx had written, “Man lives from nature, i.e., nature is his body, and he must maintain a continuing dialogue with it if he is not to die. To say that man’s physical and mental life is linked to nature simply means that nature is linked to itself, for man is a part of nature.”Karl Marx, \\"Economic and Political Manuscripts\\" in Marx, Early Writings, (New York: Penguin Books, 1977), 328 However, prior to the publication of Darwin’s Origin of Species in 1859 Marx and Engels still lacked a biological grounding for their theory of dialectical materialism. Writing in the Grundrisse in 1858 or shortly before, Marx alluded to the need for a coherent conceptualization of humanity’s relationship with the earth: “It is not the unity of living and active humanity with the natural, inorganic conditions of their metabolic exchange with nature, and hence their appropriation of nature, which requires explanation or is the result of a historic process, but rather the separation between these inorganic conditions of human existence and this active existence, a separation which is completely posited only in the relation of wage labour and capital.”John Bellamy Foster, Marx's Ecology (New York: Monthly Review Press, 2000), 202 In his attempt to furnish such an explanation, Engels implies that it was the complex thought engendered by manual labour and verbal language that spurred the development of our brains. In a biological sense, humans are not fundamentally different from other mammals, in that most mammals are only physically – and not cognitively – incapable of speech: “The dog and the horse, by association with man, have developed such a good ear for articulate speech that they easily learn to understand any language within their range of concept. Moreover they have acquired the capacity for feelings such as affection for man, gratitude, etc., which were previously foreign to them. Anyone who has had much to do with such animals will hardly be able to escape the conviction that in many cases they now feel their inability to speak as a defect, although, unfortunately, it is one that can no longer be remedied because their vocal organs are too specialized in a definite direction.” He goes on to suggest that parrots can, to a limited extent, comprehend human language – a hypothesis that has been substantiated by scientific studies.Irene Pepperberg, \\"Cognition in an African Grey Parrot: Further evidence for comprehension of categories and labels,\\" Journal of Comparative Psychology, 104 (1990) http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/com/104/1/41/ The process of cognitive development described by Engels is today known as gene-culture coevolution or the dual inheritance theory, and is widely accepted among biologists. Stephen Jay Gould has argued that this is the only scientifically sound theory of the evolution of the human brain, and stated that Engels’ essay made “the best nineteenth-century case for gene-culture coevolution.”Foster, Marx's Ecology, 203 See also *The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State *Dialectics of Nature *Dialectical materialism *Metabolic rift *Inheritance of acquired characteristics References External links * Full text online * A Soviet study pamphlet 1876 non-fiction books 1876 essays Marxist books Human evolution books ","title":"The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man"},{"id":"41156066","text":"Mukarrib () is a title variously defined as \\"priest-kings\\" or \\"federators\\"; the mukarribs may have been the first rulers of the early South Arabian states.

It occupies the former docks of the East Asiatic Company, and faces the Chao Phraya River and Charoen Krung Road. The complex opened in 2012 after extensive renovation of the site. History The Denmark-based East Asiatic Company was founded in 1897 and was one of several Western firms conducting trade with Siam at the time. The company owned port facilities on the Chao Phraya, which included several warehouses, the oldest extant building dating from 1907. The port ceased operations in 1947, and the facilities later fell into disuse. In May 2011, real estate company TCC Land announced its plans to renovate and develop the site into a retail/entertainment complex to be known as Asiatique The Riverfront. Location and facilities Asiatique is on Charoen Krung Road in Bangkok's Bang Kho Laem District, facing the Chao Phraya River. It occupies 30 rai () of land, with plans for future expansion to include a total of 72 rai () of mixed-use development. The mall, featuring a historical theme from the period of King Chulalongkorn's reign (1868–1910), operates as an open-air night market. It features 1,500 shops and stalls and 40 restaurants, most of which are housed in the former warehouses. Other historical buildings and objects include an old sawmill and a World War II bomb shelter. There is a parking lot tram designed to look like a car from Bangkok's former tram system, and the site is decorated with bronze statues representing maritime activity. The mall's layout is divided into four thematic sections, called districts. Chareonkrung District is named after Charoen Krung Road, and contains performing venues for the Joe Louis Traditional Thai Puppet Theatre, the Calypso Cabaret show and live Muay Thai performances, as well as shops selling handicrafts and souvenirs. Town Square District features foreign restaurants and sports bars, and includes a small event space. Factory District focuses on trendy fashions, products and restaurants. Waterfront District lies along Asiatique's waterfront promenade—claimed to be Bangkok's longest at —and includes several riverside restaurants, a large event space used for concerts, festivals and New Year celebrations, and Asiatique Sky, the tallest Ferris wheel in Bangkok at . Asiatique opened on 27 April 2012, and has been observed to fulfil a replacement role for the previously popular Suan Lum Night Bazaar, which had closed down in 2010.

Carter is summoned to Hawk's office where he meets a representative of the CIA. Carter is shown a box containing the shriveled genitals of a man – the only remains of a CIA agent investigating a communist pornography ring based in Budapest, Hungary. Assisted by Hollywood movie director, Preston Mohr, AXE identifies the films as the work of Michael Blackstone – a once famous director blacklisted and forced into exile during anti-communist purges. Several of the films feature Mona Manning – a former Hollywood actress forced into making pornography due to her waning career and poor mental health. Carter is ordered to infiltrate the pornography ring and targets Paulus Werner – a West German national who recruits young women from the UK and Western Europe for the pornographers under the cover of a travelling theatrical troupe. Werner was last seen in London by the CIA agent who was subsequently murdered and mutilated. Carter goes to London and stakes out Soho posing as spiv Nathan Connors. He picks up Pamela Martin, an English prostitute, and discovers that she is familiar with Paulus Werner's attempts to recruit prostitutes for overseas trips. Carter offers Pamela GBP 50 to bring Werner to her flat on the pretext of being interested in going to Europe with him. Carter lies in wait and interrogates Werner when he returns with Pamela. Werner identifies Bela Kojak as his contact in Budapest and reveals that the entire pornography ring is organized by the mysterious Dr Miljas Eros with the involvement of Chinese diplomat, Fang Chi. Carter kills Werner. Carter recruits Pamela with the promise of a job in AXE if the mission is successful. Posing as Jacob Werner, Paulus Werner's cousin, Carter and Pam lead the theatrical troupe by train from Vienna to Budapest. At their hotel, Carter discovers a stash of heroin hidden in the theatrical troupe's equipment and suspects Paulus Werner of operating a clandestine drug smuggling ring. In Pest, Carter hires a small boat to take him up the Danube to Vác, where Michael Blackstone lives in a villa. At the villa Carter discovers Pamela and the other girls in the troupe have already been drugged and transported there. They are held captive by two female German guards – whom Carter assumes are ex-Nazi concentration camp guards. Carter enters the villa and kills three male staff and the two female guards. Before he can free the captive women Carter eavesdrops on a high-level meeting between Blackstone, his wife, Bela Kojak, Fang Chi and Mona Manning. Carter hides in Bela Kojak's car and is taken to a castle on the Danube – the set for the pornographic films. Carter is captured, stripped, shackled to the floor and subjected to peine forte et dure – crushed under heavy stones. Carter sticks to his Jacob Werner cover story. Kojak believes him to be a superior American agent and surmises he is indeed Nick Carter and debates whether to sell him to Russian or to Chinese authorities. As a last gambit Carter reveals the heroin he found stashed in the kit of the girls prepared by Paulus Werner and informs Kojak that someone in his organization is using him to bring heroin into the country – a capital offence. Carter informs him that Paulus Werner was probably working with Dr Miljas Eros. Kojak then reveals that he is in fact Dr Miljas Eros - second in command of Hungarian State Security Police. Carter is drugged and forced to perform in a sex act whilst being filmed. He is untied and taken back to the castle dungeon. He escapes and kills three guards. Carter searches the castle and sets fire to the room used to store the pornographic movies. As he is leaving the castle he encounters Michael and Sylvia Blackstone and Mona Manning escaping on foot. He forces them back to the castle to release the captive girls. Sylvia Blackstone refuses to leave. Michael Blackstone, Mona Manning, Pamela Martin and Carter head for Blackstone's cruiser moored nearby. They embark on a high-speed chase down the Danube toward the border with Austria. On the way, Blackstone expresses concern about what will happen to him when he is repatriated to America. He goes below deck and shoots Mona Manning and then himself. The cruiser is disabled by gunfire from their pursuers. Carter and Pamela tie themselves together and dive overboard, negotiating the underwater nets that prevent unauthorized entry and exit into Hungary. Exhausted Carter and Pamela wash up on the banks of the Danube inside Austria. Hawk informs Carter that the mission has been a success and asks what he will do about Pamela Martin who is still recovering in hospital. Carter refuses to see her and drives home to his apartment.

The party was founded in 2012 by a number of constituents who broke away from the Congress for the Republic (CPR). Led by the short-time CPR secretary-general Abderraouf Ayadi, the party however remained loosely allied with the governing Troika coalition of Ennahda, CPR and Ettakatol. Generally seen as a secular, left-leaning party, the Wafa Movement reached out to Islamists on the grounds of seeking unity among revolutionary forces. In the 2014 elections, the party lost its parliamentary representation. History =Formation= On 19 April 2012, CPR secretary-general Abderraouf Ayadi had been dismissed from his official functions following controversies over Ayadis approval of Samir Geageas right- wing Lebanese Forces, a Christian militia responsible for the Sabra and Shatila massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees in 1982. A few days later, on 9 May 2012, Ayadi and a group of fellow constituents announced that they would leave the CPR to form a new party under the name of \\"Wafa\\", meaning \\"faithful\\", used here in the sense of \\"faithful to the revolution\\". On July 25, the party was officially founded, \\"with the sole objective of realizing the revolution’s objectives: work, liberty and national dignity.\\" =Constituent Assembly= In November 2012, the party announced it would sue Israel for the 1988 assassination of Fatah-official Abu Jihad by Sayeret Matkal Colonel Nahum Lev in Tunis. Wafa attorney Fadira Najjar considered the assassination a war crime under international law and claimed that deposed Tunisian president Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali as well as security officials colluded with Israel. In January 2013, secretary-general Ayadi supported the inscription of legal jihad into the Constitution of Tunisia. Allegedly he also advocated the integration of jihadist fighters into the Tunisian Army, which however was immediately demented by Wafa party officials. On 20 November 2013, Wafa president Abderraouf Ayadi proposed that a dialogue be started with militant Islamist group Ansar al-Sharia. =2014 elections= Having started with 12 parliamentarians in 2012, the Wafa Movement went into the 2014 parliamentary election with 10 seats, all of which it lost receiving a mere 0.70% of the electoral vote. For the following presidential election, Wafa had already nominated its secretary-general Ayadi who however withdrew his candidacy after the electoral results were published calling the election a \\"soft coup\\" with the comeback of old regime figures. Wafa harshly criticized the candidacy of Beji Caid Essebsi, stating that he would have no place in a revolution of the youth against the former regime. The party later supported the electoral campaign of interim president Moncef Marzouki.

The current season, Pen Tor 2020, is ongoing and is available on Channel One (31) and YouTube. (The YouTube version is time-locked in Thailand and will be available for local audience one month after original airing date.)  Plot  Pentor is a sit-com about modern working singles who are looking for their soul mates. It is centered on the busy life of Mr. Pentor, who is a businessman in the BKL company. He wants to have an easy life and just wants to be a normal businessman like other people in Bangkok. However, what he wants is never what he gets.  Characters  = Main = * Pentor is a charismatic man working as a sales staff at BKL (Bangkok Life) magazine. After a break-up, he is single, but knows who the love of his life is and is, in addition to wooing around, also trying to win her back. He is usually the voice of reason and, being the most financially stable, the main patron in the quartet of BKL men especialy when it comes to paying for food and nightlife. Pentor is shown to have good pronunciation of English. * Porjai is Pentor's younger sister who lives with him at his two-bedroom apartment. She usually is short-tempered and can be regarded as paranoid. She cares a lot about her brother and his ex- girlfriend, usually saying that Thip is the only woman she will ever accept as a sister-in-law. * Thipayawan (Thip) is Pentor's ex-girlfriend. Although they went through a break-up, she is still on good terms with the rest of the characters. She is a devout practitioner of Buddhism and would practically never lie, despite being surrounded by people who trick and backstab each other all the time. As Karma would have it, Thip rarely, if ever, ends up on the wrong side of the stick. Thip generally does not start her own mischief, or even say a white lie, unless it is required to teach someone a lesson. When she does so, she begs \\"the grace of Buddha\\" for forgiveness, and her plans can be surprisingly effective. She is usually aware of Pentor's plans and still has feelings for him, but is afraid to resume the relationship. * Kanthep is Porjai's current boyfriend (as of Season 2018). He sometimes participates in Pentor's antics, and their relationship is usually on a \\"lion and tiger\\" basis, meaning that they equally respect each other in terms of their man skills. = BKL = * Wisetniyom (Yom), played by (pseudonymous) Jeab Chern- Yim, hails from Phitsanulok Province and works as the art director at BKL. He is always on the lookout for entertainment and nightlife, to the point that he frequently resorts to mischievously obtaining money from his colleagues to fuel his urges. He has an imaginary friend named Sakhrin to whom he attributes all his wrongdoings and mischief. He has an on-and-off relationship with Mint, who runs Bangbar with him as co-owners. His evil plans are usually concocted by consulting Sakhrin, but they usually backfire. For example, he once implored the others to praise him as \\"Wisetniyom the Savior of BKL\\" bragging his leads to a five-million baht deal, only to discover that it was a ploy directed against Pentor and the deal never took place. He is usually teased about his father being behind bars. Despite his frequent failures, his plans are usually the most complicated and skillfully designed. In addition to friends at BKL and Pentor's connections, Yom seems to have other connections in the underworld. * Wok, portrayed by Gitti Chiawwongkul, is a young proofreader at BKL, the youngest of the BKL quartet. He used to date Chompoo, but broke up after a string of distrust. He owns a big bike and it is a big part of his lifestyle. He is usually cowardly and would find every single way to get out of fights. He is extremely afraid of ghosts and would even avoid uttering the word itself, using \\"suki\\" in its stead. * Ood, portrayed by (pseudonymous) Ood Pentor, is the columnist at BKL and the oldest of the boys. He is into alternative music and lifestyle. His obese wife usually torments him and is the cause of his crisis. He is also constantly worried about his two children. He used to hang out with the Dwarf Association until they banned his gang. He refers to himself as a \\"gray man\\", which indicates that he is merely following along with Yom and Wok's plans. That excuse usually can't exclude him from his responsibilities, though. * Samon (Mhon) is the boss of them all, but is never above the shenanigans of the rest of the office. She expresses her fondness for younger boys and gives them the tough love. She is the main voice of reason for BKL, but is not above screaming and yelling at her subordinates, when they are acting like little boys themselves. * Julia, a half-Brazilian, is a new online sales staff at BKL. She lives in the same apartment building as Pentor, and they met on bad terms after she called the police on the boys' loud party. She developed friendship with the boys after a scuffle at Bangbar, where she led the offensive against a group of employees from a rival company. * Nipon is a high-level executive of BKL. He is off- screen, but sometimes extends the baton on Mhon and her staff and influences BKL policies and plans. = Bangbar = * Mint operates Bangbar, the local pub & restaurant located 100 meters from BKL office . She used to date Yom. Despite the break-up, Yom still owns part of the share in the place. They are still friends with benefits when she's drunk, to the point that she would always interject Yom's advances that she would never drink with him again, usually only to fail and wake up naked next to him. At some point, Mint developed her own guardian angel, \\"Sakh-lilly,\\" the female version of Sakhrin. * Juab works as the chief of waitstaff at the restaurant. He usually handles the floor while Mint and Yom are not available. He has a cheesy demeanor towards the co-owners, but is otherwise competent. = Supporting Characters =  Family Members  Some family members rarely appear on screen, but are frequently mentioned. * Torpong is Pentor and Porjai's father. He rarely appears in the set and Porjai frequently expresses her longing to see her father again. He is a mischievous and tricky man, a gene that clearly reflected in Pentor. * Truengjai is Torpong's ex-wife who lives in the US. She rarely visits her children. * Klum and his unnamed wife are Wok's parents. Wok's friends at BKL usually tease about Klum being feminine, which is not true. * Yim and his unnamed wife are Yom's parents. In the same vein, people usually joke about Yim being behind bars. * Uncle Ngiam is Mint's uncle-in-law who appeared in early seasons. He usually comes to Bangbar as an extra pair of hands. He usually causes other problems of his own. * Looknam, usually called Changnam (lit. \\"Water Elephant\\"), is Ood's obese wife who usually torments him. For the sake of her family, she seeks to moderate Ood's lifestyle and behavior, getting angry when she catches him out drinking, going to nightclubs, or overspending.  Other Characters  * Golf is a kathoey (male with female behavior) housekeeper at Pentor and Porjai's apartment. She is usually involved with her friends and often gets into trouble with \\"kathoey stuff\\" (brawls, jealousy, debts, etc.) and also often needs someone to bail out for her. * Lai works at the minimart on the first floor of Pentor's apartment complex. The place almost went bankrupt during the original season, but Pentor and Porjai purchased the business to keep him employed. The minimart has become an extension to their home since, with the cast frequently hanging out. In addition to sofa and eating space, it also has computers available for an hourly rate. In season 2020, the minimart also operates a small food pantry in response to COVID-19. * Berm is a security guard for the apartment complex. He struggles to earn his stripes and advance in his career. * Mor Mha (lit. \\"Fortuneteller Dog\\") once made a series of (negative) divinations on various members of the cast. The fallout of his divinations affected the cast for a while. * Yos is a Police Captain (OF-3) at the local department. He is known by the BKL quartet and rarely appears. * Sakhrin and Sakh-lilly are Yom and Mint's \\"guardian angels,\\" or more like imaginary friends. In the more recent seasons, it appears that anyone can summon them (males to Sakhrin, and females to Sakh-lilly) for advice. There is no clear criteria for summoning them. Yom is known to especially act out talking to Sakhrin in extended conversations, where he shifts around to imitate actually talking to Sakhrin, causing people around him to question his sanity. When these guardians are active, the characters speak in a more aggressive tone and end each sentences with \\"hey, hey, hey!\\" Despite not actually existing in the show, they play a lot of roles in explaining the thought processes of many characters concocting their ploys on many occasions.  Previous Love Interests  A main plot point in Pen Tor is the quest for the characters to find the love of their lives. Previous dates, excluding one-night stands, are non-exhaustively listed below in no particular order. * Nu is Porjai's ex- boyfriend who had prominent role in earlier parts. * Kaopad used to have a crush on Pentor, but her love was not reciprocated. * Bank pretended to love Golf for a while and serially swindled her money. * Mr. Manop used to date Mhon for a while, before ghosting her after Mor Mha divined that he has a \\"wife-killing curse.\\" * Joe is dating Mhon. He is in his early 20s, shown to be conscripted for a few episodes. * Chompoo studied at the same place as Wok. She quickly married after dumping him for the final time following a rocky relationship. * Prang is Wok's newest relationship as of 2020. She is a pharmacist who behaves with extreme politeness, but does not hesitate to grab Wok's head and cuss at him, should he misbehave. * Mr. Big used to be with Mint, who uses him to antagonize Yom, after a drunken night inadvertently assisted by Yom's drugging.

Found across the Northern Hemisphere, it is the most widely distributed of all corvids. This article discusses its physiology, including its homeostasis, respiration, circulatory system, and osmoregulation. Physiology =Habitat variation and physiological regulation= Maintaining homeostasis through internal regulatory mechanisms is directly affected by habitat variation. The common raven is considered to be a homeotherm, an endotherm, and a regulator, so it is required to adjust its internal physiological state in response to environmental changes.Berg, R (1999). Corvus corax: Common Raven. Animal Diversity Web. Retrieved 20 October 2013. Food habitats influence the metabolic rate of the Common Raven. Since common ravens are omnivores, metabolic rates must fluctuate according to the type of food consumed. According to one study, species that consume only fruit possess lower metabolisms compared to species that ate both fruit and insect material. The high metabolic rate of the common raven is partially due to the diversity of its diet. Altitude is another factor that requires the common raven to regulate. Organisms existing at elevations below 1,100 m (3,500 ft) feet have lower metabolisms than organisms living at higher altitudes. Generally, warmer temperatures are associated with lower altitudes, so less energy is required to maintain a constant internal temperature. Bergmann’s rule can also be applied to the common raven. Individuals inhabiting higher altitudes and exposed to colder temperatures are usually larger than ravens living at lower latitudes or in warmer temperatures.Eduardo, J., Bicudo, P. W., Buttemer, W. A., Chappell, M. A., Pearson, J. T., Bech, C. (2010). Ecological and Environmental Physiology of Birds. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 134-186. . Also, higher altitudes are associated with lower oxygen partial pressure, so ravens living at high elevations are confronted with reduced oxygen availability. To compensate for less ambient oxygen, common ravens undergo increased respiratory rates, enhanced oxygen loading of hemoglobin at the respiratory surface, and improved oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. Common ravens occupy a widespread geographical range and are found in many different habitats, including tundra, seacoasts, cliffs, mountainous forests, plains, deserts, and woodlands. Due to such a diverse habitat, this species is exposed to various temperatures and amounts of precipitation. Individuals that exist in warmer, drier environments have lower basal metabolic rates than organisms inhabiting non-arid areas. Physiologically, a reduced metabolic rate decreases endogenous heat production to prevent evaporative water loss, or more simply evaporation, and conserve energy in an environment with limited resources. A reduction of total evaporative water loss consists of decreases of both respiratory and cutaneous evaporation. In contrast, common ravens living at higher latitudes in temperate regions experience high basal metabolic rates. A higher metabolism is related to increased thermogenesis and cold tolerance. In relation to temperature and precipitation, common ravens are exposed to changing seasons with climate extremes. Within the common raven species, the degree of climatic seasonality is related to the magnitude of fluctuations in basal metabolic rate and total evaporative water loss. For instance, populations living in Alberta are subjected to both extremely cold temperatures in the winter and very hot and dry weather during the summer months. Furthermore, the common raven is not known to migrate long distances to avoid the winter season, so it is required to regulate and cope with the environmental conditions. Habitat variation often leads to changes in activity levels. Ravens engaged in flight are considered metabolically active. During periods of flight, the cells require more oxygen, and the heat generated must be dissipated to avoid hyperthermia. In response, the common raven experiences an increased heart rate and cardiac output. Another method used by many species of birds to regulate thermal conductance is by internally adjusting blood flow through shunt vessels. More specifically, arterial and venous blood vessels are organized to bypass the countercurrent heat exchange occurring in the upper portion of a bird’s legs. Countercurrent heat exchange involves arrangements of blood vessels that allow heat to transfer from warm arterial blood to cooler venous blood travelling to the body’s core. Through this mechanism, arterial blood remains warm before reaching the body’s periphery. =Respiration= Ravens have a high metabolic rate that drives flight. Air flow is directed through the lungs via air sacs. The sacs are used to create a continuous unidirectional flow of fresh air over the respiratory surface. Most birds have nine air sacs, grouped into anterior and posterior sacs, but the common raven as a member of the Passeriformes group only has seven air sacs (missing two cervical air sacs).Christal, Pollock \\"Passerine Anatomy\\" The common raven can be found in all parts of the globe. At higher altitudes and in warmer climates the oxygen concentration in the air is lower compared to low altitude or colder climate. Also, flight is a much more metabolically demanding movement then walking or running, and therefore we see a proportionally larger respiratory system in birds than in mammals. The respiratory tract of birds possesses unique air movement properties. Air moves in a unidirectional flow and blood travels in a concurrent direction to air flow. An advantage of this type of system is it minimizes dead space and enables the bird to maintain a highly oxidative, active output. The respiratory system of the common raven is no different. Flight is a unique feat among birds and provides them with many advantages in terms of food, predation, and movement. It is suggested that cardiovascular variables play a large part in avian flight and were naturally selected over time. Specifically, the avian heart evolved to pump more blood throughout a bird’s body while it is engaged in flight. During rigorous activity, especially when flying, the demand for oxygen is high. Birds proceed through the four steps of the oxygen cascade: 1\\\\. Convection of oxygen to lungs via ventilation 2\\\\. The diffusion of oxygen from the lungs into the blood stream 3\\\\. Oxygen-rich blood is transported to the peripheral tissues by convection 4\\\\. Oxygen diffuses into the mitochondria. Fick's laws of diffusion can be applied to oxygen cascade events in avian species. There is a proportional relationship between the tissue sheet and the surface area. Finally, in the avian respiratory system, the partial pressure of oxygen between the gas, lung, and the vascular capillaries depends upon the ventilation rate and air that is already inhaled. =Circulation= Like all avian species, the blood of the common raven transports nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, metabolic waste products, hormones, and heat. Avian blood possesses a more alkaline pH ranging from 7.5 to 7.6, and blood bicarbonate values are between 16 and 32 mmol/L. In addition, pumping blood has a carbon dioxide partial pressure of about 28 mmHg, which is lower than that of placental mammals. Therefore, bird species, including the common raven, seem to be in an acute state of respiratory alkalosis relative to mammals. It is also important to note that alterations of respiratory patterns in response to changing oxygen needs do not severely affect the pH of arterial blood. Glucose, calcium and proteins are other components of avian blood’s chemical properties. Blood glucose levels range from 200 to 400 mg/dL and can increase with stress. Calcium levels are approximately 8 to 12 mg/dL, and total protein, which consists of albumin and globulins, is between 3 and 5.5 mg/dl. Since the common raven flies at high altitudes, efficient gas exchange between the respiratory and circulatory systems permits this species to tolerate hypoxia. Due to the unidirectional flow of air and the high oxygen affinity of avian hemoglobin, blood leaving the parabronchi has almost equivalent oxygen partial pressure as inhaled air. Avian hearts pump more blood per unit time than mammalian hearts. Cardiac output (mL/minute) can be calculated by multiplying heart rate (beats/minute) by stroke volume (mL/beat). Like other vertebrates with closed circulatory systems, pumping blood of the common raven can be described by several physiological principles. These principles and laws include diffusion,Hill, R. W., Wyse, G. A., Anderson, M. (2012). Animal Physiology (3 ed.). Massachusetts: Sinauer Associates, Inc. Sunderland, Massachusetts. pp. 617-646. blood viscosity,Sturkie, P. D., Griminger, P. (1976). Avian Physiology. Berlin: Springer. pp. 53-75. osmotic pressure, LaPlace's Law (Young-Laplace Equation), Poiseuille's Law (Hagen-Poiseuille equation), and the Frank-Starling law of the heart.Hill, R. W., Wyse, G. A., Anderson, M. (2012). Animal Physiology (3 ed.). Massachusetts: Sinauer Associates, Inc. Sunderland, Massachusetts. pp. 647-678. Furthermore, it is important to note that the osmotic pressure of the common raven is low compared to mammalian species. Reduced osmotic pressure is due to a lower concentration of plasma albumin protein. Blood composition The blood composition of the common raven is similar to that of most avian species. In general, the blood is composed of plasma and cells. Plasma contains approximately 85% water and 9-11% protein. The remaining components include glucose, amino acids, hormones, electrolytes, antibodies and waste products. The erythrocytes (red blood cells) of the common raven are elliptical with a centrally located oval nucleus. Avian blood has counts of between 2.5 and 4 million red blood cells per cubic millimetre. The red blood cells of birds are larger than those of mammals and have a short life span of 28 to 45 days. Common Ravens’ erythrocytes contain two components of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin A accounts for 60% to 90% of the total, and the remainder is hemoglobin D.Wood, S. C., Weber, R. E., Hargens, A. R., Millard, R. W. (1992). Physiological Adaptations in Vertebrates: Respiration, Circulation, and Metabolism. New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc. pp 257-272. . Avian thrombocytes contain a nucleus and are involved in hemostasis. Avian white blood cells include lymphocytes, heterophiles, monocytes, and eosinophils. =Osmoregulation= Environmental challenges on osmoregulation The Corvus corax can live in a wide range of habitats, it is very successful at adapting to different environments. Although the Corvus corax can live in many different habitats, the common raven is hyperosmotic to its habitat as it is always in a terrestrial habitat. Living in a terrestrial habitat causes a few problems for the common raven, it constantly must intake water and salts to balance its water/salt content in the blood. Since the terrestrial habitat is hyposmotic in relation to the Corvus corax it does not have to worry about water loss, it uses kidneys to regulate salt content in the blood and usually excretes a very dilute excrement. The common raven is a very experienced hunter and will hunt anything from bird eggs, to frogs, to the common field mouse and even up to a small chicken. When times are tough for hunting the Corvus corax will rely on its keen sense of smell and sight to scavenge for food. The Corvus corax is a master scavenger by trade and has an intake of salt by eating mostly carrion from dead animals though the common raven will easily eat human garbage if available to them. In the case of most of the populations of Corvus corax which live more in the northern parts of North America, harsh winters can be very advantageous with large death rate of herbivores allowing for easy meals for the raven. In fact food can be so bountiful that the common raven which is usually solitary in nature, only ever living with one partner to actually allow other scavengers such as bald eagles, magpies, crows, and other scavenger to fest with them on a dead pile with little to no competition.B. Heinrich, \\"Winter foraging at carcasses by three sympatric corvids, with emphasis on recruitment by the raven, Corvus corax Department of Zoology, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405, February 21, 1988. The difference in diet between the populations of Corvus corax near the sea compared to the boreal forest is immense; ravens near the more marine based terrestrial habitat prey primarily on gulls eggs and hatchlings as well as supplementing their diet with seaweed; note that the feces of these populations showed huge quantities of seaweed indicating that it was an essential source of nutrition even though it was largely indigestible. These populations have a much higher intake of salt compared to the populations in the more inland regions and therefore excrete more potent hyperosmotic excrement. With a diet with sufficient salt concentrations the Corvus corax rarely is desperate for salt intake, instead it focusses on water intake primarily through the food it eats, but if this is not sufficient it will drink water or consume snow in the winter as required. Overall the Corvus corax does quite well in many different terrestrial environments using the adaptations of not only its kidneys but as well its enormously vast and varying diet to keep its osmotic pressures of its blood in check. The Corvus corax truly is the master of its domain, being not only a great hunter but a master scavenger, this species of bird can seemingly withstand any change in its environment and physiological conditions in order to survive and prosper.Edt. Glen P. Semenchuck, \\"The Atlas of Breeding birds of Alberta\\", Federation of Alberta Naturalists, PO Box 1472, Edmonton AB, T5J 2N5, 1992. Primary osmoregulatory organ or system Regulation of water and electrolyte balance, or osmoregulation, within the internal environment of common ravens involves the interaction of the kidneys, intestinal tract, skin, and respiratory tracts. However, the kidneys are the primary osmoregulatory organs with the primary function of eliminating wastes and excess water and solutes.Whittow, G. C. (2000). Sturkie’s Avian Physiology (5 ed.). San Diego: Academic Press. pp. 265-297. Like other birds, the common raven is considered a uricotelic organism Hill, R. W., Wyse, G. A., Anderson, M. (2012). Animal Physiology (3 ed.). Massachusetts: Sinauer Associates, Inc. Sunderland, Massachusetts. p. 782. with an osmoregulatory system consisting of a pair of kidneys that constitute 0.8% of its body mass. Similar to mammalian species, the functional units of avian kidneys are the nephrons. Externally, the kidneys are elongated and have three lobes, and the inner portion contains a cortex and medulla. Within the cortex, nephrons are organized around central veins of the efferent venous system. In contrast, the medulla is structured into medullary cones that contain nephron elements, specifically collecting ducts and loops of Henle. As the collecting ducts descend through the medulla, they combine and empty their contents into the ureter. There are two types of avian nephrons, and nephrons become larger as depth from the kidney surface increases. Reptilian-type nephrons are the smallest nephrons, are found near a kidney’s surface, possess simple glomeruli, and do not have loops of Henle. Conversely, between 10% and 30% of the total nephron population is composed of mammalian-type nephrons, which are located in the innermost area of the kidney, have complex glomeruli, and contain loops of Henle. Once the kidneys receive blood, filtration of substances from the blood into urine takes place. The glomerular filtration rate of single nephrons in birds is low because avian glomeruli have small surface area. Through the process of reabsorption, the majority of the fluid volume and solutes are transported from the urine to the blood. Next, secretion of materials from the renal epithelia into the urine occurs. Finally, urine as the end product travels to the ureters to be excreted. The kidneys of a common raven filter about eleven times its total body water daily, and more than 95% of the filtered water is reabsorbed. Urine of birds is typically concentrated to an osmolarity that is two to three times the osmolarity of plasma. Glomerular filtration only accounts for 10% to 20% of urinary urate. Greater than 90% of urate excreted by the kidneys is derived from the process of secretion. Circulation and respiration The osmoregulatory system is interconnected with the circulatory system to permit effective regulation of salt and water balance. Circulatory fluids function in renal clearance, which is the blood volume that substances are removed from within the kidneys during a certain time period. In addition to filtration, the circulatory system also plays a role in reabsorption. Furthermore, the role of the renal portal system is to regulate renal hemodynamics during times of decreased arterial blood pressure. Kidneys of common ravens receive arterial and afferent venous blood and are drained by efferent veins. In terms of the arterial blood supply, the arteries entering the kidneys branch into numerous smaller arteries and eventually form afferent arterioles that supply the glomeruli. The peritubular blood supply is composed of efferent arterioles leaving the glomeruli of reptilian-type nephrons that drain into sinuses of the cortex. On the other hand, the vasa recta are formed by efferent arterioles exiting the glomeruli of mammalia-type nephrons. Next, the renal portal system, which involves the afferent veins, obtains blood from the ischiadic and external iliac veins. The renal portal valve is situated between the renal portal vein and the common iliac vein which leads to the posterior vena cava. Closing of the valve directs the blood to flow into the renal portal vein, and when the valve is open, blood flows into the vena cava. After entering the renal portal vein, blood enters the peritubular blood supply. Here, blood from the portal veins and the efferent arterioles are mixed and travel out of the kidneys through the efferent veins. Alternatively, blood can also flow towards the liver. Research indicates that kidneys of avian species receive approximately 10% to 15% of cardiac output. The renal blood of common ravens is composed of various molecules. As was stated earlier, approximately 95% of the filtered water is reabsorbed into the blood supply. Since birds are able to produce hyperosmotic urine, the blood plasma usually contains a lot of water. In normally hydrated birds, the blood concentrations of arginine vasotocin, which is a peptide hormone involved in regulating plasma water concentrations, is 10pg/mL. Other hormones within the blood supply include angiotensin, aldosterone, and atrial natriuretic peptide. In addition, plasma sodium concentrations are maintained within normal levels even when dietary sodium intake is altered in order to regulate blood pressure, greater than 98% of filtered calcium is reabsorbed, and about 60% of filtered phosphate is excreted in urine. Before filtration, plasma urate concentration is between 0.1 and 0.7 mM. Finally, the arterial pH of birds is alkaline and maintained at a value of approximately 7.5. The avian respiratory system is not in direct contact with the osmoregulatory system. However, the respiratory tract participates in osmoregulation through evaporative water loss. Since common ravens are endothermic and have high rates of ventilation, respiratory water loss is inevitable. Cells and mechanisms of osmoregulation =Filtration into Bowman's capsule= The kidneys in aves are divided into units called lobules. Within each lobule are numerous nephrons responsible for filtering blood. Arterial blood that is directed to the kidney enters the glomerulus under high pressure and leaks out in between the endothelial cells of the glomerular capillaries into Bowman’s capsules. The blood plasma filtrate contains waste along with non-waste essentials like glucose and ions. Once the filtrate enters the proximal tubule reabsorption of metabolically useful molecules into the blood begins.Ritchison, Gary, \\"Urinary System, Salt Glands, and Osmoregulation\\", \\"Eastern Kentucky University, Department of Biology\\", 2008 =Reabsorption in proximal tubes= Reabsorption of molecules and ions back into the blood from the proximal tube is done via epithelial cells. The epithelial cell create a low Na+ concentration within the cell by actively pumping out Na+ into the blood via a Na+/K+ ATPase pump on the basolateral membrane. The osmotic gradient allows for the cotransport of Na+ with molecules such as Cl-, glucose, and vitamins into the epithelial cell from the apical side (side facing the proximal tubule). Water freely crosses the apical side into the epithelial cell following the solutes entering actively. With all the essential molecules inside the epithelial cell, some such as Cl-, glucose and vitamins pass through their respective channels on the basal lateral side into the blood. Na+ continues to be pumped into the blood maintaining the osmotic gradient allowing for continuous reabsorption of these molecules and ions.Muller, Michael, \\"The Excretory System\\" , \\"University of Illinois at Chicago, Department of Biological Sciences\\", 2004 Terrestrial birds like the Corvus corax produce urine that is osmotically more concentrated then its blood plasma. This is likely due to the fact that water is not as abundant in raven habitat. =Regulating water loss= A key function of the Loop of Henle is to provide a large distance over which ions are transported out of the nephrons and since water will follow the transport of ions out of the nephrons, the Loop of Henle is an important structure to insure minimal water lose out the ureters. Since not all nephrons of aves have the Loop of Henle, a birds ability to create a hypertonic filtrate can be more challenging then mammals. In response to dehydration birds release a hormone known as arginine vasotocin (AVT) into the blood. Among its roles AVT reduces the rate at which blood plasma filters out of the glomeruli and into the Bowman’s capsule. This reduces the total amount of water leaving the blood. Another function of AVT is its ability to increase permeability of the collecting ducts by opening protein water channels. These channels, called aquaporins, allow more solutes to leave the collecting duct and water will follow through osmosis. These two functions of AVT allow birds to maintain a concentrated urine. Avian kidneys do not send urine to a bladder. Instead it is sent via the ureters to the cloaca to be deposited into the lower intestine. The epithelium of the lower intestine absorbs a large amount of sodium chloride, and water follows osmotically to be reabsorbed into the blood stream. This final step insures a concentrated waste product with minimal water and ion loss from excretion. Special adaptations Since the expansion of the human population and urbanization, there have been numerous extinctions of birds. Extinctions threaten nearly 12% of bird species, but this does not account for an additional 12% of species located in small geographical ranges where human actions rapidly destroy habitats. Due to pressures from humans and the environment, birds have unique features that permit adaptations to changing conditions. The common raven migrates long distances for food and mating. Since ravens, and birds in general, travel to such extents, they have a unique adaptation for flying in high altitude environments. Specifically, neural mediating reflexes increase breathing. The locomotors system stimulates breathing directly from feed forward stimulation from brainstem centers and feedback stimulation from exercising muscles. In the carotid body, the bird’s chemoreceptors detect low oxygen and stimulate breathing during hypoxia.Scott, G. R., & Milsom, W. K. (2009). Control of Breathing in Birds: Implications for High-Altitude Flight. In Cardio-Respiratory Control in Vertebrates (pp. 429-448). Springer Berlin Heidelberg. Also, if breathing is hypoxic, the bird can use CO2/pH-sensitive chemoreceptors to restrain breathing. Due to ventilatory responses, this process leads to secondary hypocapnia. Because birds are exposed to a wide variety of toxic gases and air borne particles in the environment, studies have used birds to measure air quality. Not only is a bird’s respiration adapted to handle high-altitude flight, but so too is the circulatory system. In general, birds have larger heart sizes and higher cardiac output. During flight, birds can sustain their heart rates, and their myosin flight muscles have better oxygen diffusion because of a high degree of branching between the capillaries. The common raven lives in a wide variety of climates. Due to its habitat and food, the common raven has unique features that allow it to regulate osmotic challenges. Common ravens can be observed in oceans consuming water. However, when birds consume salt loaded prey or drink salt water, the body’s internal osmoregularity increases. The solution produced is considerably more concentrated than seawater. Birds are the only group of vertebrates that have the ability to produce hyposmotic urine. The ability to produce hyposmotic urine is from the medullary cones. Urine is mixed with digestive fluids rather than directly eliminated. Consequently, the avian gut plays an important role in water and salt regulation. In mammals, the osmotic gradient is urea, whereas in birds, sodium chloride is the major solute in the medullary cones. In birds, the kidneys are not solely responsible for osmoregulation. A unique feature in birds is the lower intestine, which absorbs fluids and electrolytes that were not absorbed by the small intestine or the kidneys. These osmoregulatory adaptations allow the common raven to thrive in diverse habitats.

His father was a union electrician. Van Arsdale was descendant from 17th century Dutch immigrants to New York and a descendant of John Van Arsdale, a Colonial army veteran of the American Revolutionary War, who climbed up a greased flagpole to retrieve a Union Jack flag which still flew during the evacuation of the British from New York. Van Arsdale was also related to noted historian James Riker. Ruffini, Gene and Kheel, Theodore. Harry Van Arsdale, Jr.: Labor's Champion 2015. At the age of 28 he rose to the leadership of Union Local 3 of the IBEW, a labor union for electricians. He eventually served as a leader of the Building Trades Council in New York City, and was the first President of the New York City Central Labor Council (NYCCLC) AFL-CIO in New York City. He held this post from its formation in 1958 until his death in 1986. He was also a civil rights leader who met with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The Electchester Houses are diverse and boast a large African-American, Hispanic & Jewish Community. During Van Arsdale's tenure as Business Manager of his union and the NYCCLC, he introduced employer-funded pension systems in the building trades and created a community for electrical workers and their families to live called Electchester in Queens, New York. He also was responsible for the organization of the taxi drivers in New York City and was a driving force in organizing hospital workers in the city. The hospital workers union, SEIU 1199, later became one of the single largest unions in the city with over 100,000 members. Today the New York City Central Labor Council (NYCCLC) is the largest local labor membership organization under the direction of the national AFL-CIO. Founded in 1959 the NYCCLC represents over 400 local New York City unions in both the public and private sectors of the New York economy [2]. The New York City Central Labor Council is a non-profit labor membership organization devoted to supporting, advancing and advocating for its member organizations and all 'working class' people of New York City. Of the 11 million total workers represented by the AFL-CIO, the New York City Central Labor Council alone represents close to 15% of its total membership.

Liccardo was elected mayor in November 2014. He was reelected in 2018 with 75.8% of the vote. As the leader of the California Big City Mayors Coalition, Liccardo has advocated on statewide issues including homelessness and COVID-19 response. Early life One of five children to Salvador and Laura (née Aceves) Liccardo, Sam Liccardo grew up in Saratoga, California and graduated from Bellarmine College Preparatory in 1987. Liccardo received a bachelor's degree in government from Georgetown University, where he graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. He later earned his Juris Doctor and Master of Public Policy at Harvard Law School and Harvard Kennedy School. Prior to his election to public office in 2006 he served as a criminal prosecutor in the Santa Clara County District Attorney's office. Political career =San Jose City Council= In 2006, Liccardo ran for San Jose's District 3 Council seat. After placing first in an eight-candidate June primary with 43% percent of the vote, Liccardo went on to place first in the November runoff election, this time with 61.3%. In June 2010, he won his reelection to the City Council with 80.16% of the primary vote. As councilman, Liccardo pushed for more affordable housing, championing an inclusionary zoning ordinance in 2008 that required developers to either build 15% of their units in any project to be affordable and rent-restricted, or to pay fees to finance affordable housing construction elsewhere. The statewide homebuilding industry vocally opposed the measure in part because it would make San Jose the largest US city with a citywide inclusionary requirement, and sued after its passage; subsequent litigation prevented its implementation until the California Supreme Court eventually sided with the City of San Jose in 2015. Liccardo also advocated for more high-rise housing in San José's downtown, including the construction of the $135 million, 23-story high rise at One South Market. =Mayor of San Jose= 2014 election In 2014, Liccardo ran for Mayor of San Jose to succeed termed-out Mayor Chuck Reed. He placed second to County Supervisor Dave Cortese in a five-candidate June primary with 25.7% of the vote, but placed first in the November runoff with 50.8% of the vote. The contentious run-off election focused on the City’s chronic budgetary challenges, as well as Liccardo’s support for pension reforms led by Mayor Reed that had City employee unions and their allies heavilying support of Cortese. Liccardo’s financial support that emanated primarily from the tech business community, but he also had support of several environmental organizations. Settling pension reform and budgetary battles In his first year in office, he helped guide negotiations on an agreement with all 11 of city's employee unions that closed the retiree healthcare plan to new employees, and which could save the city $3 billion in employee retirement costs over the course of three decades. In the 2016 elections, voters approved the agreement by passing Measure F with more than 61% of the vote.http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/CA/Santa_Clara/64404/184226/Web01/en/summary.html This measure replaced Mayor Reed’s contentious pension reform plan, which has faced a series of legal challenges since its 2012 passage. Transportation right Since his election in 2015, Liccardo has pushed forward a range of transit-oriented policies. Under Liccardo, San Jose has constructed more than 20 miles of bike infrastructure, including bike boulevards and buffered bike lanes. Liccardo advocated for a half-cent sales tax increase called Measure B on the 2016 November ballot, which passed with over 70%. The tax is devoted to transportation, with funds dedicated to expanding BART, reducing traffic congestion, and filling potholes. Despite the majority vote, it has become a controversial topic throughout Santa Clara County as the tax measure has also attracted negative reception from Saratoga, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, Cupertino, and Mountain View as well as San Jose Sharks Sports & Entertainment, LLC who have harshly criticized Liccardo with wasting millions of dollars on insufficient roadway projects, lack of focus on local transit and bus service, and insisting that the BART subway through Downtown San Jose be a single bore rather than the traditional double bore. \\"Smart City\\" Vision, and Digital Inclusion left In March 2016, Liccardo unveiled a Smart City Vision, with the expressed goal to make San Jose the \\"most innovative city in America by 2020.\\" Liccardo hired Shireen Santosham to be his Chief Innovation Officer and lead the newly-created Mayor's Office of Technology and Innovation (MOTI). The Smart City Vision received unanimous approval from the City Council in March, and in June 2016 the city created an Office of Civic Innovation to meet its goals. Since then, Liccardo formed a partnership with Facebook to deploy the company's wireless, high-speed internet technology called \\"Terragraph\\" in downtown San José, and the City of San José launched a project to bring free wireless internet to two schools in San José's East Side Union School District. In 2019, Liccardo launched the San Jose Digital Inclusion Fund, a $24 million initiative to bridge the digital divide in San Jose by extending broadband, distributing devices, and improving digital skills among tens of thousands of low-income families. The pandemic accelerated the City's efforts, resulting in distribution of free hotspots to 15,800 children by October of 2020, with another 50,000 residents receiving broadband service through the City's wi-fi partnership with the East Side Union High School District. After Council approved funding in late 2020, Liccardo announced the City's progress of reaching 100,000 residents, along with plan to connect 300,000 East San Jose residents--the population of a city the size of Pittsburgh or St. Louis--by full build-out in 2022. https://www.sfgate.com/news/bayarea/article/Sj-City-Touts-Efforts-To-Close- Digital-Divide-15645613.phphttps://www.radio.com/kcbsradio/news/local/san- jose-making-rapid-progress-in-closing-the-digital-divide Housing crisis Throughout Liccardo's tenure, many San Jose residents suffer under very high rent burdens attributable in part to the California's housing shortage To boost housing supply, Liccardo led efforts to reduce fees on construction of granny units and Downtown high- rises,https://www.sanjoseinside.com/news/sj-mayor-proposes-granny-unit- program-to-boost-housing- supply/#:~:text=Liccardo%2C%20in%20partnership%20with%20Housing,built%20into%20an%20existing%20home.https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san- jose-mayor-proposes-cutting-construction-taxes-in-half-for-feasible-high-rise- homes/100434/ increase housing densities--including such innovative approaches such as \\"coliving--near transit, and streamline approvals of \\"backyard homes,\\" also known as alternate dwelling units. https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/05/san-joses-first-pre-approved-granny- unit-permitted-and-built-in-just-12-weeks/https://abc7news.com/housing-crisis- bay-area-market-2019-affordable-prices/5497085/ Liccardo has also pushed for more public resources for affordable housing, building on his work on inclusionary housing as a councilmember. In 2018, he led a coalition of affordable housing advocates to propose Measure V, a $450 million housing bond measure which secured 64% of the vote, but still narrowly failed due to California's 2/3 threshold for passage of bond measures.https://ballotpedia.org/San_Jose,_California,_Measure_V,_Housing_Bond_Issue_(November_2018)https://www.ktvu.com/news/san- jose-housing-bond-measure-fails-public-safety-measure-wins- approvalhttps://nextcity.org/daily/entry/the-capital-of-silicon-valley-wants- to-borrow-450-million-for-housing Liccardo vowed to push to find a successful alternative, and in 2019, he partnered with SiliconValley@Home and other affordable housing organizations to put Measure E--a supplemental transfer tax on properties sold for $2 million or more--on the March 2020 ballot. The measure passed with 53% support, and will generate up to an estimated $70 million annually for affordable housing and homeless response.https://ballotpedia.org/San_Jose,_California,_Measure_E,_Real_Property_Transfer_Tax_(March_2020) https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/03/04/san-jose-measure-e- results-calif-prop-13.htmlhttps://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/03/san-jose- voters-decide-on-measure-e-property-transfer-tax-to-be-used-for-affordable- housing/ San Jose's efforts to house its 6,000 homeless residents have been hindered by the extremely high costs of housing construction in the region. https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/25/new-bay-area-crown-most-expensive- place-to-build-in-the-world/ In response, Liccardo pushed to find more innovative, cost-effective ways to house the homeless, including the use of prefabricated and modular construction,https://www.kron4.com/news/bay- area/san-jose-mayor-proposes-17m-in-emergency-housing-for-homeless/ construction of \\"tiny homes,\\"https://www.kqed.org/news/11768261/san-jose- builds-its-first-ever-tiny-homes-for-the-homeless and the rehabilitation of deteriorating motels. and the Santa Clara Inn. With the non-profit Destination:Home, he also pushed to find collaborative approaches with landlords to take more homeless veterans as tenants; on Veteran's Day in 2015, he and Santa Clara County Supervisor Dave Cortese launched the \\"All the Way Home\\" campaign with Destination:Home. One year after launching the program, the group announced it had found homes for more than 500 homeless veterans, and had housed some 1,772 by 2020.https://destinationhomesv.org/allthewayhome/ In late 2017, Liccardo called for the construction of 25,000 new housing units in San Jose, including 10,000 affordable units.https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-jose-mayor-announces-plan-to- build-25000-homes-by-2022/34221/ Liccardo since publicly admitted that the lack of housing affordability and homelessness have persisted as crises for which he had made insufficient progress, https://medium.com/@SamLiccardo/housing-our-greatest-challenge-d2311625a7fa and is very unlikely to reach those goals, particularly as a severe recession, pandemic, the failure of Measure V, and high construction costshttps://www.sanjoseinside.com/news/study-growing-construction-costs-may- hinder-new-housing-construction-in-san- jose/https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/25/new-bay-area-crown-most-expensive- place-to-build-in-the-world/ have inhibited progress. 2017 flooding On February 21–22, 2017, after one month of heavy rainfall, Anderson Dam overspilled, causing the Coyote Creek flooded in central San Jose, displacing 14,000 people. Residents complained that the city failed to uphold its duty to protect and warn its citizens. Liccardo and other city officials accepted responsibility for failures to warn residents in their emergency response, but also pointed to very inaccurate flood projections and warnings from the regional agency responsible for flood protection in the County, the Santa Clara Valley Water District. Environment and Energy Liccardo's environmental initiatives have focused on preserving open space, halting sprawling development, launching a community choice energy program, and reducing GhG emissions in energy consumption, building design, and transportation. In 2015, Liccardo publicly expressed a desire to halt plans for large-scale development in Coyote Valley--an environmentally sensitive, little-developed area south of San Jose--instead preserving it as wildlife habitat and open space for future generations. https://www.greenbelt.org/blog/san-jose-mayor-sam-liccardo-new-era-of- conservation-gaining-momentum-in-coyote-valley/ Working with the Peninsula Open Space Trust and the Open Space Authority, a plan was assembled to purchase large tracts of land to preserve the Valley, using philanthropic and public sources. In 2018, Liccardo proposed and led Measure T, a bond measure that would enable the use of $50 million for purchase of open space to risks of flooding and wildfires, targeting Coyote Valley.https://ballotpedia.org/San_Jose,_California,_Measure_T,_Public_Safety_and_Infrastructure_Bond_Issue_(November_2018)https://savesfbay.org/yes- on-measure-t-for-a-bay-smart-san-jose After overwhelming support of Measure T from the electorate https://ballotpedia.org/San_Jose,_California,_Measure_T,_Public_Safety_and_Infrastructure_Bond_Issue_(November_2018) the City worked with POST and OSA to consummate a transaction for almost 1,000 acres of land, and the Council unanimously approved it.https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/12/opinion-make-coyote-valley-a-gift- to-future-generations/ https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/06/in-fight- against-urban-sprawl-san-jose-passes-93-million-deal-to-preserve-coyote- valley/https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/11/06/coyote-valley-gets- preserved-in-historic-san-jose.html In 2018, the development company Ponderosa Homes sought to build approximately 1,000 single-family luxury homes in the mostly undeveloped Evergreen foothills of San Jose, in contravention of the city's General Plan.

In May 2017, the San Jose City Council unanimously agreed to launch a Community Choice Energy program, becoming the largest city in the country to do so. Mayor Liccardo advocated for the adoption of a Community Choice Energy program as a way to take action against climate change while President Trump's administration turned back to fossil fuels. Two years later, San Jose became the largest U.S. city to adopt mandates of all-electric new construction for all new buildings, with a few limited exceptions. https://www.utilitydive.com/news/san-jose-becomes-largest- city-requiring-all-electric-buildings-as-local-cl/563249/ https://www.sanjoseinside.com/news/san-jose-approves-reach-codes-to-promote- green-development/ 2018 election Liccardo was elected to a second term of office on June 5, 2018, winning support of 76% of the voters.https://ballotpedia.org/San_Jose,_California,_Measure_B,_Evergreen_Senior_Housing_Initiative_(June_2018) Personal life Sam Liccardo married Jessica Garcia-Kohl in 2013. He was named for his paternal grandfather, who owned and operated a neighborhood grocery store in downtown San Jose, the Notre Dame Market. Liccardo is descended from the first Mexican settlers in the Bay Area, and is also of Sicilian and Irish descent. Liccardo made an appearance on Episode 1 Season 6 of the HBO series Silicon Valley. In January 2019 Liccardo was severely injured in a bicycle accident. He was admitted to Regional Medical Center with a broken vertebrae and sternum.

Since then, the Australian Medical Students' Association has grown and evolved into one of Australia's largest student representative bodies. =Past presidents= * 2020: Daniel Zou, The University of Melbourne * 2019: Jessica Yang, The University of Western Sydney * 2018: Alex Farrell, The University of NSW * 2017: Rob Thomas, The University of Queensland * 2016: Elise Buisson, The University of Western Sydney * 2015: James Lawler, The University of Newcastle * 2014: Jessica Dean, Monash University * 2013: Benjamin Veness, The University of Sydney * 2012: James Churchill, The University of Melbourne * 2011: Robert Marshall, The University of Western Australia * 2010: Ross Roberts-Thomson, The University of Adelaide * 2009: Tiffany Fulde, The University of New South Wales * 2008: Michael Bonning, The University of Queensland * 2007: Robert Mitchell, Monash University * 2006: Teresa Cosgriff, The University of Melbourne * 2005: Dror Maor, The University of Western Australia * 2004: Matthew Hutchinson, The University of Adelaide * 2003: Nicholas Brown, The University of Queensland Advocacy =2020 advocacy priorities= National Advocacy Priorities are determined through a National Survey distributed around August. The survey allows medical students to provide input into the national priorities for the following year, and comment on what is most important to them. Each comment is read and national priorities created off that. At the meeting of the third National AMSA Council of each year, AMSA presents the advocacy priorities. For 2020, they are as follows; National Priorities * Improving medical student mental health and wellbeing * Preventing increases in medical student numbers and establishment of new medical schools * Action on sexual harassment, bullying and discrimination in medicine * Increasing intake onto specialty training programs that align with workforce demand, with a particular focus on regional and rural areas * Work collaboratively to improve the health of Australia’s Indigenous people (including recruitment and support of Indigenous medical students) * Improving the quality of clinical schools and placements for medical students * Increase the availability of quality internships for all medical students * Working collaboratively to minimise the health impacts of climate change through mitigation and adaptation strategies # # # # # # Annual conferences =AMSA National Convention= AMSA National Convention is the largest student-run conference in the world and brings together 1,000 medical students from across Australia and New Zealand. Since its inception in 1960, Convention has grown and evolved to be the highlight of the medical student calendar. The Convention program consists of 4 inspiring academic days, one sports day including the annual Emergency Medical Challenge and 5 themed social evenings culminating in the Gala Ball. In its 61st year, Convention will descend on Melbourne from the 29th of June 2020. =AMSA Global Health Conference= Originally known as the Developing World Conference, and established in 2005 by members of the Australian Medical Students' Association, the Global Health Conference is a meeting of medical students from around Australia that aims to fulfill the desire of medical students to discuss broader issues relevant to global health. The inaugural conference hosted 200 delegates in Sydney, whilst the 2006 conference in Perth saw more than 250 students attend. In 2007, Adelaide took the conference to new heights, hosting over 300 delegates at an event that sold out nationwide in less than 12 hours. The academic programme is filled with speakers from many disciplines, including workers from Medecins Sans Frontieres, Health Advisors to Non-for-profit organisations, Politicians and many many more; while the social programme allows students to meet like-minded individuals from around the country. The Global Health Conference aims to educate and empower medical students with knowledge about global health. The 2019 AMSA Global Health Conference was held in Sydney, NSW and the 2020 Conference will be in Gold Coast, QLD. =AMSA Rural Health Summit= Of AMSA's major conferences, the Rural Health Summit is the newest, having started in 2016. That year it was hosted in Melbourne and known as the Rural Health Colloquium, before taking on the name of Rural Health Summit from 2017 onwards. The Rural Health Summit has a focus on the health related challenges faced by Australia's rural and regional population, and illuminates the opportunities that exist for medical students to pursue a career in rural and regional areas. Previous locations for The AMSA Rural Health Summit: * 2016: Melbourne (As the AMSA Rural Health Colloquium) * 2017: Wollongong * 2018: Albury * 2019: Cairns * 2020: Armidale The 2020 AMSA Rural Health Summit will be held in Armidale, NSW. =AMSA National Leadership Development Seminar= AMSA's National Leadership Development Seminar (NLDS) is held each year in the nation's capital, Canberra. Running over five days and 4 nights, the seminar is an exclusive conference on the medical student calendar with only 80-100 students selected to attend. The seminar aims to bring together some of the brightest minds and challenge and develop their leadership and opinions. Community engagement =Vampire Cup= The Vampire Cup is AMSA's national blood drive run in association with the Australian Red Cross. The 22 Australian medical societies compete for the prestigious cup with the society with the highest number of donations per capita being awarded victory. In 2019, there were 3461 donations nationally with Australian National University (ANUMSS) winning the Vampire Cup for the second year in a row with 79.3% of their cohort donating. James Cook University won the most total donations with a record 845 donations, the most in the history of the competition. This year Vampire Cup will be held from March 15 - May 9.

Equipment & Style  The standard Crupellarius is clad almost entirely from head to foot in Lorica segmentata, as well as similar Manica,Manica, Caballo (Paul Brown) 2007, Romanarmy.net/manica.shtml and carried a Scutum and Gladius. They wore a helmet resembling a perforated bucket, with only very small openings for the eyes and mouth, similar to a medieval Great helm. Thus, the Crupellarius' fighting style was suited for men with a large muscular build, able to withstand the weight of the heavy plate armor he wears. The Crupellarius are more defense orientated, depending on his stamina and endurance to survive the battle, tiring out attacking foes before counterattacking them when they are worn out.

The PROTOTYP museum ist privately funded and wants to convey excitement about cars by focussing the designers and race drivers like Otto Mathé and Petermax Müller who re-established racing after 1945. In many cases early race and sports cars in Germany were technically based on pre-war constructions like the Volkswagen. For that reason the PROTOTYP museum shows a special interest in this vehicle. In post-war racing unique self-built cars – prototypes – were designed and raced. These cars are here on display, together with other race and record cars, sports and even modern formula cars.

Nexenta develops the products NexentaStor, NexentaCloud, NexentaFusion, and NexentaEdge.  History  = Origins = In 2005, Nexenta was founded by Alex Aizman and Dmitry Yusupov, software developers and former executives at network vendor Silverback (later acquired by Brocade). Aizman and Yusupov previously worked together as the authors of the open source iSCSI initiator software in the Linux kernel. The company was created to support the open source Nexenta OS project after Sun Microsystems released the bulk of its Solaris operating system under free software licenses as OpenSolaris. Nexenta OS was an operating system that integrated Sun's Solaris kernel and core technologies with applications from the popular Debian and Ubuntu operating systems. Nexenta has been acquired by DataDirect Networks, \\"a developer of high- performance storage for modern workloads including artificial intelligence and big data\\", in May 2019. = Data storage = The company's entry into the data storage included use at Stanford University in 2012 and 2013. The field had been dominated by companies such as EMC Corporation, DataDirect Networks and NetApp, who sold hardware storage appliances. Nexenta intended to compete by creating a storage system that did not require specialized hardware. Instead of producing hardware, the company would provide software to run on lower- costing commodity computing hardware, a model later marketed as software defined storage. = Partnerships and open source = Much of Nexenta's business comes from partners that provide hardware and services alongside Nexenta software. The company's software is pre-installed on storage systems from vendors including Supermicro, Cisco Systems and Dell. Nexenta continued to contribute to free and open source software used in its products. When Oracle Corporation discontinued OpenSolaris in 2010, the company became a founding member of the illumos open source project that would replace it. Products Nexenta's product NexentaStor is software for network-attached storage (NAS) and storage area network (SAN) services. NexentaStor was derived from the Nexenta OS based on the illumos operating system. The software runs on commodity hardware and creates storage virtualization pools consisting of multiple hard disk drives and solid-state drives. Data can be organized in a flexible number of filesystems and block storage, and files can be accessed over the widely used Network File System (NFS) and CIFS protocols, while block storage uses iSCSI or Fibre Channel protocols. NexentaStor allows online snapshots to be taken of data and replicated to other systems. For high availability Nexenta uses RSF-1 cluster to build a HA storage.

He is the son of Bancha Lamsam and Thanphuying Sam-aungvarn Lamsam (maiden name Devakula; half-sister of M.R. Pridiyathorn Devakula). The Lamsam family is one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Thailand. Bantoon is Lamsam 5th generation and heading family's banking and insurance flagship. He is currently the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Kasikornbank, the top financial service provider group in Thailand.  Early life  Banthoon Lamsam was born on 15 January 1953, son of Bancha Lamsam and Thanphuying Sam-aungvarn Lamsam (maiden name Mom Rajawongse Sam- aungvarn Devakula; daughter of Prince Priditheppong Devakula and Mom Rajawongse Sa-ang Pramoj). Bantoon has two younger sisters. Bantoon is a grandson of Choti Lamsam who founded Kasikornbank in 1945 as Thai Farmers Bank.

After graduation, he spent two years with the military's Directorate of Joint Intelligence in the Ministry of Defence. In 1979, Banthoon joined Thai Farmers Bank (later changed to Kasikornbank) in the international banking department, where he was promoted to first vice president in 1986. In 1987 he moved to the domestic banking department as a senior vice president. In 1992, Banthoon was nominated president as of Thai Farmers Bank (TFB). After the 1997 Asian financial crisis (known as วิกฤตต้มยำกุ้ง, literally translated as Tom Yam Kung crisis), he was the first to introduce the term \\"reengineering\\" to Thailand's banking industry. The Lamsam family became a minority shareholder of Kasikornbank. Banthoon Lamsam is an important contributor to the Democratic Party. Banthoon was skeptical of the country's economic policies during Pol. Lt. Col Thaksin Shinawatra's term as the prime minister of Thailand, and it was rumored that he had been approached by the Democratic Party for the position of the party leader in 2004. In 2002, Banthoon became president and CEO of TFB. In 2003, he changed the logo and name of the bank from Thai Farmers Bank (TFB) to the current name, Kasikornbank (KBank), improvising Chinese characters style into the logo, \\"K\\". In 2010, after Dr. Prasarn Trairatvorakul, then the president of KBank, left to become the Governor of the Bank of Thailand, Banthoon assumed the role of both president and CEO of KBank. He also instituted a senior executive position called \\"domain coordinator\\" and nominated four executive vice presidents to assume the positions of business domain, risk domain, infrastructure domain, and resource domain. Two of these executives later became the presidents of KBank and the other two became board directors. In May 2013, Banthoon published a 608-page novel, Sinaeha Montra Lanna, which he wrote in 13 months.

In 1884, the congregation had grown to 193 people. Construction of a new church was initiated in 1905 when the Catholics were numbered 1200 people. The construction was carried out by the Jesuit priest who worked in the field. The new church was inaugurated in November of that year, the new church was made of stone walls and tin roof, with some parts still made of thatched palm leaves.

Doge ( , ) is an Internet meme that became popular in 2013. The meme typically consists of a picture of a Shiba Inu dog accompanied by multicolored text in Comic Sans font in the foreground. The text, representing a kind of internal monologue, is deliberately written in a form of broken English. The meme is based on a 2010 photograph, and became popular in late 2013, being named as Know Your Memes \\"top meme\\" of that year. A cryptocurrency based on Doge, the Dogecoin, was launched in December 2013, and the Shiba Inu has been featured on Josh Wise's NASCAR car as part of a sponsorship deal. Doge has also been referenced by members of the United States Congress, a safety video for Delta Air Lines, a Google Easter egg, and the video for the song \\"Word Crimes\\" by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic. Toward the end of the decade, the meme saw a resurgence in popularity. Several online polls and media outlets recognized Doge as one of the best Internet memes of the 2010s.  Structure  Doge uses two-word phrases in which the first word is almost always one of five modifiers (\\"so\\", \\"such\\", \\"many\\", \\"much\\", and \\"very\\"), and the departure from correct English is to use the modifier with a word that it cannot properly modify. For example, \\"Much respect. So noble.\\" uses the doge modifiers but is not \\"proper\\" doge because the modifiers are used in a formally correct fashion; the doge version would be \\"Much noble, so respect.\\" In addition to these phrases, a doge utterance often ends with a single word, most often \\"wow\\" but with \\"amaze\\" and \\"excite\\" also being used. Since the inception of the meme, several variations and spin-offs have been created, including \\"liquified Doge\\", a variation wherein the dog's shape is morphed into other animals, and \\"ironic Doge\\", a version where the Doge character is put into ironic and uncharacteristic situations. The ironic Doge memes have spawned several other related characters, often dogs themselves. One of which is Cheems, another Shiba Inu who is typically characterized by a speech impediment that adds the letter \\"M\\" throughout its speech. Cheems is based on an image of a dog named Balltze. Walter, a bull terrier character who is typically portrayed as liking \\"moster trucks\\" and firetrucks, is another commonly recurring ironic Doge character. He is based on the bull terrier Nelson, who originally became popular in 2018 after his owner, Victoria Leigh, posted a picture of Nelson to Twitter, with the caption \\"When u open the front-facing camera on accident.\\" These memes are mostly present on subreddits like r/dogelore. In 2020, rumors of Nelson's death began to circulate the internet, although they turned out to be false.  Origin and pronunciation  , the female Shiba Inu featured in the original meme, is a pedigree puppy who was sent to an animal shelter when her puppy mill shut down. She was adopted in 2008 by Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Satō, and named after the citrus fruit kabosu because Sato thought she had a round face like the fruit. Another Shiba Inu featured in the meme is Suki, a female belonging to photographer Jonathan Fleming from San Francisco. His wife had accidentally put a scarf in the wash, making it shrink. He took a photograph of Suki wearing the scarf outside on a cold night in February 2010. Kabosu was first pictured in a 2010 blog post by Sato; afterwards, variations of the pictures using overlaid Comic Sans text were posted from a Tumblr blog, Shiba Confessions. However, the use of the intentionally misspelled \\"doge\\" dates back to June 2005, when it was mentioned in an episode of Homestar Runners puppet series. The image began to grow in popularity after it was posted on Reddit in October 2010 in a post titled \\"LMBO LOOK @ THIS FUKKEN DOGE.\\" The most common pronunciations of \\"doge\\" are and . In non-English speaking countries, \\"doge\\" is occasionally pronounced \\"dodge\\". Those unfamiliar or unacquainted with the meme also use the pronunciations \\"doggie\\", , , or simply \\"dog\\".  Spread  =Popularity= In August 2013, images of the meme were spammed on Reddit's r/MURICA subreddit by 4chan's random imageboard, /b/. Online searches for the meme began to increase in July 2013. The meme was ranked at No. 12 on MTV's list of \\"50 Things Pop Culture Had Us Giving Thanks For\\" in 2013. Io9 compared the internal dialog of the Shiba Inu dogs to lolspeak. On December 13, Doge was named the \\"top meme\\" of 2013 by Know Your Meme. A report on The Daily Dot in December 2016 found that Doge's popularity peaked in 2014 and then fell due to \\"overexposure and co-option by advertisers and mainstream 'normies'\\", but remained stable since then and returned to Tumblr's top 10 shared memes of the year in 2016. Several media publications included Doge on a list of memes that helped define Internet culture in the 2010s, and wrote on the meme's influence of further online developments, such as DoggoLingo and WeRateDogs. Evan McMurry of ABC News and Stacey Ritzen of The Daily Dot both ranked Doge as the number-one meme of the 2010s. In December 2019, Doge was voted as the best Internet meme of the 2010s on a poll held by The Tab, gaining 737 votes, or 22 percent of total votes cast. Voxs Aja Romano included Doge on a list of 11 memes \\"that captured the decade,\\" writing that it took \\"cat memes to new, absurdist heights, an early hallmark of neo-Dadaist millennial humor.\\" The Japanese perception is remarkably different; Kabosu and Satō are rather known as a pet and owner rather than a meme, and her blog is the fourth-most popular pet-related blog in the country as of December 2013. Reacting to the meme, she explained, \\"To be honest, some pictures are strange for me, but it's still funny! I'm very impressed with their skills and taste. Around me, nobody knows about the doge meme. Maybe I don't understand memes very well, because I'm living such an analog life.\\" Satō has also expressed that she had learned that \\"the risk of the internet is that anyone in the world can see my life on my blog\\". Fleming stated that in his experience, the Shiba Inu breed has become more recognized due to the meme. =Culture deciptions= In late December 2013, members of the U.S. Congress produced material in the meme's style. The Huffington Post commented that Doge was \\"killed\\" because of the Congress members' usage of the meme. Google created a Doge Easter egg: when doge meme was entered into the YouTube search bar, all the site's text would be displayed in colorful Comic Sans, similar to the kind used by the meme. In December 2013, the Dogecoin was introduced as a new cryptocurrency, making it the first cryptocurrency to be based on an Internet meme; the viral phenomenon, along with usage of the Comic Sans MS typeface, gave it \\"the Internet density of a large star\\" according to Medium writer Quinn Norton. By early 2014, Doge's popularity was sustained by internet communities on social media, accompanied by the rapid growth and acceptance of Dogecoin. In April 2014, Doge experienced a second major media resurgence due to revelations of the Dogecoin community's intent to sponsor Josh Wise in NASCAR and place a picture of the Shiba Inu on his vehicle. The car features in downloadable content for the video game NASCAR '14. Media outlets have embraced the meme while reporting on the cryptocurrency and the car, with titles featuring phrases such as \\"so wow\\" and \\"very vroom\\". In January 2014, Sydney-based web developers Katia Eirin and Bennett Wong created Doge Weather, a weather website and mobile app incorporating the meme. Doge Weather reports the temperature and weather conditions based on the user's geographic location. In April 2014, Doge Weather became available as a mobile app for iOS 7 costing 99¢. In mid-2014, the advertisement agency DDB Stockholm had Doge feature prominently in an advertising campaign for the public transport company SL in Stockholm, Sweden. The advertisement concerned the company's special summer tickets, and featured Doge holding a public transport ticket in his mouth, with phrases such as \\"many summer\\", \\"such cheap\\" and \\"very buy\\". In the video for \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic's 2014 song \\"Word Crimes\\", a song about bad grammar, a Doge tweet is used to illustrate the types of bad grammar referenced in that part of the song. \\"Doge\\" was one of several additions to Dictionary.com in November 2015. The website defines it as not just the image macro and its variants, but also the form of \\"language\\" that it utilizes. In the 2015 video game The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes, a reference to the meme can be found in the North American version only. When examining one of the ancient bookshelves, the text reads \\"Still, coming here has at least afforded me the rare chance to explore these ancient ruins. So ancient. Such ruin.\\" The reference was met with mixed views from fans of the series. In 2017, the video game Smite added a Doge skin for the goddess Skadi. Mozilla's Servo project incorporated the meme into the project logo from May 2016 to February 2020. For April Fools' Day in 2017, China Central Television published a hoax story of the death of Kabosu.

The World Championships were held in July 2011, where Rubio finished fifth in the women's open compound event, sixth in the women's team compound event, and seventh in the mixed compound team event. The London qualifying competition, the British Open, was held August 2011 in Heathrow at Stoke Mandeville, with Rudio competing to try to earn Spain one of the twenty qualifying sports on offer. There was no funding for her and other Spanish archers to compete at the London hosted event because Spanish Sports Federation for Persons with Physical Disabilities refused to prioritize the sport after poor performances by Spanish archers at the previous world championships held in Turin. Funding to attend instead came from regional sports federations. On the first qualifying day of competition, there was winds up to 40 kilometers an hour. That day, she scored a 642. Her earlier performance in the ranking round where she finished eighth meant she did not have to participate in the first qualifying round. She finished in third place. Spain had a qualifying competition to determine who would represent the country at the 2012 Games. Participating at the March 2012 qualifying event, she met the minimum IPC qualifying score of 650 with two scores of 651 and 653 in the women's open test compound bow.

Background Beginning in June 2013, reports from media outlets including The Guardian and The Washington Post revealed operational details of the US National Security Agency's mass surveillance of US and foreign nationals. The reports were based on a series of secret documents from 2009 leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Further disclosures indicated that the NSA's surveillance operations extended to include the intelligence-gathering agencies of US allies, including the British Government Communications Headquarters and Australia's Defence Signals Directorate, members of the UKUSA or \\"Five Eyes\\" security agreement. In October 2013, Der Spiegel reported that German intelligence services had received \\"credible evidence\\" that Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone had been targeted by the NSA. Later that month reports from Der Spiegel and Fairfax Media stated that Australian embassies and diplomatic posts in Asia were being used to intercept phone calls and data, including during the 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference. In 2004 during the East Timor crisis, Indonesia bugged Australia's embassy in Jakarta and tried to recruit Australians as spies, retiring Indonesian intelligence chief General Abdullah Mahmud Hendropriyono admitted. http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/11/14/1100384426722.htmlhttps://thediplomat.com/2013/11/indonesia- and-australia-deteriorating-diplomacy/ Response The allegations prompted Indonesia to recall its ambassador to Australia, Nadjib Riphat Kesoema, in November 2013. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott initially declined to apologise or comment on the matter, prompting accusations from President Yudhoyono that he had \\"belittled\\" Indonesia's response to the issue. Speaking to Parliament, Abbott went on to argue that Australia \\"should not be expected to apologise for...reasonable intelligence-gathering activities\\". The next day, Indonesia responded by reviewing all areas of bilateral cooperation, including on issues around people smuggling, a major component of the Abbott Government's Operation Sovereign Borders policy. The Australian government's response to the issue prompted criticism from current and former leaders in both countries, including former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, former Vice President Jusuf Kalla, Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa, in addition to negative reporting in the Indonesian media. Demonstrations were also held outside Australia's embassy in Jakarta. In contrast, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten declined to criticise Abbott, instead emphasising the importance of the bilateral relationship, and arguing that the government's response should be a \\"Team Australia moment\\". Former Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer argued that the diplomatic response to the issue was \\"beyond the control\\" of Tony Abbott's government. The allegations, and Indonesia's response, attracted significant coverage in Indonesian and international media, particularly following allegations that the US National Security Agency had attempted to monitor the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

The camera uses five different sensors to determine when to automatically take photos and can take up to 2,000 pictures a day. It was released in July 2013 and is used primarily for lifelogging, entertainment and travel. As of 16 October 2016, OMG Life, the company behind Autographer discontinued operations.  History  Autographer was developed by British company OMG Life, a wholly owned subsidiary of Oxford Metrics Group (OMG) plc, after licensing technology from Microsoft to create a medical memory aid called the Vicon Revue. The original product was released in October 2009 and was designed to capture the lives of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other memory problems, so that their doctors could assess how many of the events the patients recalled. OMG reinvented the device as a consumer product based on feedback from customers who were using the technology for entertainment purposes. The media was first able to view prototypes for Autographer in March 2013, and journalists were invited to test the product at the London Zoo before its release. Autographer went on sale in July 2013 in the U.K. and Europe. It was initially sold on a dedicated Autographer website prior to its global release. It was featured on The Jonathan Ross Show in January 2014. That same month, UK retailer Topman used Autographers during its London Collections: Men event. The Autographer images captured by its team were publicly viewable on the brand's digital magazine website, Topman Generation. The promotion also included a daily giveaway of an Autographer. Previously only available in black, the company added new color options to Autographer, including blue, green, and yellow, at the International CES in January 2014. In March 2014, it was announced that OMG Life had developed a waterproof kit for Autographer with waterproof case maker Aquapac, allowing the device to be used underwater to a depth of 30 feet for around 30 minutes. As of 16 October 2016, OMG Life, the company behind Autographer discontinued operations.  Design and features  Autographer is wearable technology that features a hands-free, lifelogging camera in a plastic casing meant to be worn around the neck or clipped to clothing. The camera is 5 megapixels and has a 136-degree wide-angle lens that was designed to resemble a human eye. Autographer is 90x36mm in size and weighs approximately 58 grams. Autographer has five sensors to detect changes in environment. These changes trigger the camera to take a photo. There is a sensor to determine when there is a shift in color, an infrared sensor for lighting changes, a thermometer that reacts to temperature, a magnetometer that perceives direction changes, and an accelerometer which detects motion. The device also uses GPS to track where photos were taken. Unlike traditional digital cameras, it does not have a screen to preview images. The images captured by Autographer can be managed through an iOS or Android app and desktop software. Bluetooth syncing allows users to automatically port images to their devices. Using the software and apps, users are able to edit and tag images, as well as view collected data about them, including GPS. Images can also be used to create animated GIFs and stop motion videos. Autographer can take up to 2,000 photos a day and contains 8GB of memory that can store up to 16,000 images.  Reception  Autographer has received positive reviews for its ease of use, and the quality of its app and software by both Forbes and The Guardian, while the ability to take unique candid shots has been praised by The Wall Street Journal and Building Design. It has been named a top travel gift by Escapism magazine and AOL UK Travel. The product has received criticism in the media for privacy issues, and OMG has worked to address these concerns by including an etiquette guide with Autographer. Both The Wall Street Journal and The Guardian noted that the device's design makes it conspicuous when taking photos and includes a highly visible lens cover. Other negative issues cited about Autographer include image quality and price.

Smoother than canvas or denim but very resistant, calico made success in workwear clothing. Typical calicos such as polka dots, flowers and dotted lines on bandanas and ticking were the most popular motifs. In 1833, Johan Ludwig Stifel, a young and poor German immigrant came to the United States after having been an apprentice dyer and calico printer in his homeland. Walking barefoot to preserve his shoes, he reached the burgeoning city of Wheeling in West Virginia and began to work for a local farm. However his interest in textile dying returned and in 1835, he spent all his savings on a single bolt of unbleached cotton from the local mill, hand-dyed and sold it, then repeated the process another time. A new business was about to blossom. Wheeling, as a growing industrial city, notably in the steel and cigar sectors required a large workforce and consequently cheap and reliable garments. Johan Ludwig Stifel decided to convert this demand in a business opportunity giving birth to a prosperous enterprise. Meanwhile, having been married to Barbara Becht, in 1859, his sons Louis and William joined the company which turned into J. L. Stifel & Sons. In the beginning of the twentieth century the third generation of Stifels was operating a 70,000 square foot manufacturing plant employing 50 workers. The brand logo, a boot (meaning\\"stiefel\\" in German) with the word “stifel” inside, was definitely adopted. J.L.Stifel & Sons was associated with quality and their products were exported to Latin America, the Philippines, India, Canada and Africa reaching its peak with a monthly production of 3,5 million yards of clothes.http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/ohio/91001728.pdfPersonal In the spring of 1835, Johann Ludwig Stifel opened a small cleaning and dyeing establishment in a log cabin on North Main St. in Wheeling. From such tiny beginnings was developed the giant calico works which became the first plant in the nation to print yard-wide indigo blue calico, which was shipped to all parts of the world to be made into clothing. Johann Stifel, the founder of J.L. Stifel Co., was born in Neuffen, Wurttemberg, Germany, on March 13, 1807. He learned the trade of dyer and calico printer, traveled throughout Europe as a journeyman and later as a foreman in Kaiserlautern. At the age 26, he emigrated to America. He landed in Baltimore in September of 1833, then moved to Philadelphia and on the Bethlehem, Pa., where he worked in the woolen mills. In the summer of 1834, poor and alone, Johann Stifel walked from Bethlehem, Pa., to Wheeling. He traveled barefoot part of the time to save wear on his shoes. He became one of the first Germans to settle in Wheeling and in the winter of 1834-35 worked for his board on a local farm. His North Main St. establishment had a short life because of his desire to return his trade of dyeing and printing of cloth. He purchased a bolt of unbleached cotton goods for $10, dyed and sold it, and purchased a new bolt. Thus he started to develop the capital for the factory which he opened at Ninth and Main Sts., where the Virginia Apartments now stand. Here he dyed and printed cloth by hand and peddled it from a wagon. On June 18, 1835, he married Barbara Becht, a native German who was then residing in Steubenville. His life flourished and in 1859 his two sons, Louis C. and William F. Stifel, became partners in the growing firm. In 1896, the factory switched to mechanical methods of print. J. L. Stifel retired in 1874 and died on December 1, 1881. He had developed a business that would prosper for many years. His plant had a daily capacity of many miles of cotton goods and employed several hundred. Carried on by his heirs, the business was moved to the 400 block on Main St. at the turn of the century. During both World Wars, the plant converted to war production. In 1943, J. L. Stifel & Sons became the first in the textile industry to win the joint Army-Navy \\"E\\" Production Award. A declining demand for cotton goods, development of synthetic fibers and foreign imports resulted in the plant being closed in 1957. J. L. Stifel had not only become a success through a trade learned in his youth but was involved in numerous business and civic ventures. He was a stockholder and director of the Wheeling Suspension Bridge; served as director and president of the Commercial Bank; was organizer and director of the National Savings Bank of Wheeling; and vice-president and director of the Benwood Iron Works. He was founder of the first German paper in Wheeling, was a strong supporter of the Union and a member of the convention whose action brought about the separation of West Virginia from Virginia. He was also a member of the first board of Ohio County Commissioners.

Hill was the first European to see and traverse the Clare Valley. An enigmatic and little- known individual, during the late 1830s John Hill sighted and named several important rivers of South Australia, as well as many lesser streams and creeks. The former unquestionably include the Wakefield and Hutt rivers, plus (most probably) the Gilbert and Light rivers. He was also the first European to explore the headwaters of the Torrens and Onkaparinga rivers. In 1908 the Register newspaper (while incorrectly naming him 'William') accorded him the title of South Australia's \\"Discoverer of Rivers\\". Hill River and Mount Hill are named after him.There cannot be the slightest doubt that Gov. Gawler named the hill after John Hill who was a member of the Governor's Party from Port Lincoln to Franklin Harbour., J.D. Somerville, 1943, SASR PRG 15/91/29. Early life in London and New South Wales Born about 1810 in London, UK, nothing is known of his ancestry or childhood. Emerging from an apparently affluent family, in the mid-1830s he arrived at Sydney as a well-educated and financially independent young man. Undertaking pastoralism pursuits in the Monaro region, by 1837 he had travelled extensively throughout that colony, becoming acquainted with such fellow pastoralists as Edward John Eyre, and of Dr. George Imlay, one of three land-owning brothers from Eden district. Attracted to the possibilities for pastoralism and land speculation in the nascent colony of South Australia (founded nine months earlier), he arrived there on 5 September 1837 aboard the schooner Currency Lass, accompanied by James Fisher, son of James Hurtle Fisher.Sydney Monitor, 16 August 1837, p.2 During the next four years, either alone or with associates, Hill actively engaged in the exploration of the province, particularly in what became the highly productive, closer-settled districts. Hill's first priority was to reconnoitre a viable route for overlanding livestock from New South Wales, particularly through the Mount Lofty Ranges, which was the unexplored gap between the Murray River and Adelaide. Exploration of Mount Lofty Ranges =Barossa Valley= From 11 to 17 December 1837 Hill was in the party that accompanied William Light in his expedition that came across and named the Barossa Range, ergo the Barossa Valley.Elder, David (ed.): William Light's Brief Journal and Australian Diaries (Wakefield Press, Adelaide, 1984), pp. 55, 132. A few weeks later, on 1 and 2 January 1838, Hill's Arabian stallion Rainbow participated at the first horse racing event held in South Australia.Register, 20 January 1838, p. 3. =Central Mount Lofty Ranges= From 23 to 26 January 1838, John Hill and Dr George Imlay were the first Europeans to cross and re-cross the central Mount Lofty Ranges. Commencing from the Torrens Gorge at Athelstone they explored the headwaters of this river, passing through the Birdwood and Palmer districts, to reach the Murray River at Mannum. During their return journey, which was to the south of their outward trek, they sighted Mount Beevor and Mount Torrens. They then sighted and traversed the sources of the Onkaparinga River through Oakbank and Woodside, before returning to Adelaide through the Basket Range, Norton Summit and Magill districts. Despite seeing and describing many important geographical features within the region, they did not bestow any placenames. =North Mount Lofty Ranges= Between 1 and 12 March 1838, Hill led a party of four young pastoralists (including John Oakden) who became the first Europeans to reach the Riverland region of the Murray River since Sturt's party had explored it by rowboat in 1830, and were the first to do so overland, whether from Adelaide or the eastern colonies (thereby beating Hawdon and Bonney to this region). In doing so they were also the first Europeans to see and traverse the districts of Cockatoo Valley (which they named), Nuriootpa, Kapunda, Eudunda, Robertstown, and North West Bend near Morgan. On 3 March 1838, along their route, they encountered and named the Light River.Register, 17 March 1838, pp 3–4. Permanent move to South Australia Having carefully completed the groundwork for overlanding, from March to May 1838 Hill was engaged in importing livestock by sea from New South Wales, during which period he decided to permanently establish himself in South Australia.Stephens, John : Land of Promise, 1839. p.115Register, 7 April 1838, p.3. While Hill was thus engaged, in April 1838 Hawdon and Bonney had dared and succeeded at being the first overlanders. Having lost the race to be the first livestock overlander, Hill then turned his talents toward pure exploration. Exploration of the Mid North John Hill's crowning achievement came when he conducted a private (and possibly solo) exploration in early April 1839, on horseback, northward from Adelaide to South Australia's Mid North, encountering and naming both the Wakefield River, and the Hutt River.Register, 13 July 1839, p.5, and also E.J. Eyre's Autobiographical Narrative, 1832–39 (Caliban Books, London, 1984), p. 163. In doing so he was also the first European to encounter and traverse the Clare Valley. His optimistic reports later gave rise to European settlement there through a special survey by a syndicate of nine investors, most being connected to the London-based Secondary Towns Association, including such settlers as Horrocks and Gleeson. On that same expedition Hill likely passed by the Gilbert River, naming it after a close associate, Thomas Gilbert.Slee, Max : John Hill – South Australia's Discoverer of Rivers. (Adelaide 2015). Motivated (and guided) by Hill's explorations, Edward John Eyre subsequently explored the same region and on 5 June 1839 encountered the Hill River, naming it after John Hill, 'the gentleman who discovered its twin [river], the Hutt'.E.J. Eyre's Autobiographical Narrative, 1832–39 (Caliban Books, London, 1984), p. 205. By then Hill was a prominent citizen of Adelaide. Immediately following his Clare Valley exploration he became closely involved with John Morphett, Adelaide-based agent for the Secondary Towns Association. Hill next conducted four exploratory expeditions either directly or indirectly on behalf of that Association, searching for suitable sites to establish speculative towns secondary to the capital, Adelaide.Proceedings of the Secondary Towns Association (London, 1843) p. 20. http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/25074410 For reasons of competitive advantage the results of these explorations were usually confidential, being provided only to the Association's Board in London, or to the local government, but were only rarely provided to newspapers for publication. Explorations of Eyre Peninsula, Yorke Peninsula, and the South East The first such exploration was to Eyre Peninsula during August–September 1839, in company with Samuel Stephens. Using the chartered brig Rapid as a base, they were the first Europeans to explore the hinterland of Streaky Bay, and Denial Bay.Register, 26 October 1839, pp.5 and 17. In December 1839, again using a chartered vessel, the Hero under Captain John Hart, Hill explored the hinterland of the Limestone Coast at Robe and the Glenelg River but found no sites suitable for the Association's purposes.Proceedings of the Secondary Towns Association (London, 1843) p.20.http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/195933586  The South Australian Gazette, 21 February 1846, p.2. In April 1840, Hill accompanied Governor Gawler to explore the Spencer Gulf coast of Eyre Peninsula on horseback, they being the first Europeans to traverse the landward regions of this coast between Port Lincoln and the Middleback Ranges near Whyalla. They roughly followed the route of the present Lincoln Highway. During this expedition Gawler named Mount Hill after him, as well as naming other features such as Franklin Harbour at Cowell.Register, 9 May 1840, p.5. Embarking at Cowell, Gawler returned from this expedition in the brig Porter. Meanwhile, Hill was dropped off on 28 April 1840 by the government cutter Water Witch at 15 km south of Point Riley near Wallaroo.http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au:80/record=b2175295~S1  Map of route. Accompanied by Deputy Surveyor-General Thomas Burr, Hill returned to Adelaide on horseback, the pair being the first Europeans to traverse Northern Yorke Peninsula, reporting that they had discovered extensive fertile land. In January–February 1841, accompanied by Secondary Towns official George Morphett, Hill explored the arid plains due north of Morgan, toward the vicinity of Yunta, searching for a reported fertile region, but found only hardship and disappointment.Proceedings of the Secondary Towns Association (London, 1843) p.23. John Hill made several speculative land investments in Adelaide and at Yorke Peninsula. The most significant was in May 1841 when he was the original purchaser of the land grant for Section 2112, being 134 acres comprising all of modern Port Adelaide southward of St Vincent Street.South Australian Land Titles Office Register Book 21, Folio 361. Hill sold this at a loss in July 1843 when a financial crisis beset the colony, he having already returned to London in January 1843 aboard the barque Sarah and Elizabeth.Register, 21 January 1843, p.2. He had also lost money in other land speculations. Later life John Hill enjoyed high social status in South Australia until 1843, being appointed to grand juries and influential commercial positions, although never holding public office. In contrast, after 1843 Hill played no further prominent part in the colony's affairs. Sapped by financial misfortune, his life then became enigmatic. He returned to Adelaide around 1845 but lived in almost total obscurity. Although this was possibly self-imposed, former associates evidently regarded him as a social outcast. Hill died at the Adelaide Hospital on 11 August 1860, aged 50, from an ulcer related condition, and was interred in an unmarked paupers' grave at West Terrace Cemetery.Register, 15 August 1860, p.2, and 18 August 1910, p.4. There is no record that he had ever married. Legacy From 1837 to 1843 John Hill was a leading South Australian citizen, explorer, and pioneer. He made numerous explorations beyond the frontier of European settlement, encountering and (sometimes) naming important geographical features, despite being generally reticent to engage in toponymy, while having some features named after him by others. On other expeditions, although finding little of geographical significance, he nevertheless revealed sizeable areas of formerly unknown wilderness to the colonists. His personal courage as an explorer is undoubted, but he often failed to adequately record and proclaim his sightings, thereby failing to gain recognition for them. For well over a century there was much confusion and incorrect attribution among historians concerning his name and achievements until a research paper published in 2013, released as a book in 2015, convincingly identified and documented him.http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/198138462?selectedversion=NBD55486526National Library of Australia Catalogue References Further reading * 1810s births 1860 deaths Explorers of Australia Explorers of South Australia English explorers Settlers of South Australia Burials at West Terrace Cemetery ","title":"John Hill (explorer)"},{"id":"41157167","text":"Philip A.

It is the most common species of Formica in many areas, and excavates underground nests with small entrance holes. Its diet includes nectar produced by extrafloral nectaries and honeydew, which it obtains from aphids and treehoppers. It is the main host for the slave-making ant Polyergus lucidus. F. incerta was first described by Italian entomologist Carlo Emery in 1893. Its specific name comes from the Latin incertus meaning \\"uncertain\\" and seems particularly apt given the subsequent uncertainty as to the validity of the species and the difficulty in distinguishing this ant from other species living in the same area. Description antennae, mandibles, 2 compound eyes and 3 simple eyes A worker of F. incerta is very similar in appearance to Formica pallidefulva, but the former has a few chaetae on the mesosoma and around the petiole, while the latter does not. F. incerta is a slightly paler colour and less glossy than F. pallidefulva but considerable variability exists between specimens and between colonies. The queen is larger than the workers and can be distinguished from a queen of other species by three dark spots on her thorax. Distribution and habitat F. incerta is native to the eastern half of the United States. Its range extends from Minnesota, Nebraska, New England, and the Appalachian balds southwards to Colorado and possibly New Mexico. It is present in sandy and clayey soils and favors old grassland, meadows, and heathland, but is also found in sparse woodlands, forest rides, prairies, parks, lawns, and roadside verges. In many areas, it is the most abundant species of Formica ant and the first to recolonize restored grassland. Behaviour Polyergus lucidus workers raiding an F. incerta nest The nest of F. incerta is excavated below ground and consists of one or more large chambers near the surface from which descend one or several vertical galleries about in diameter and up to long. The chambers in which the ants live radiate off these and typically measure , each having a level floor and domed roof. No mound is seen on the surface above the nest, but a newly excavated entrance may be surrounded by a halo of ejected soil. The entrance is inconspicuous and up to in diameter. Occasionally, two entrances to the nest are seen. A nest harbors several thousand ants and the eggs, larvae, and pupae. The largest colonies excavated in a Michigan study had several queens, a small number of winged females and developing reproductives, a few dozen immature workers, 2,000 mature workers, 2,000 pupae, 1,500 larvae, and a similar number of eggs. Some of the late-season larvae overwinter and augment the early-season workforce in the following year. The worker ants emerge from the nest to forage during the day. Newly mated queens likely join an existing colony of the same species and new colonies are founded when workers dig a new nest near the original one, carry some of the brood across, and guide a queen to the new nest. F. incerta has a varied diet, and workers forage for nectar produced by extrafloral nectaries on such plants as sunflowers and partridge peas. They also gather the honeydew from aphids and treehoppers and defend these food sources from non-nestmates, from ants of other species, and from parasitoids. In regions where larger ant species are numerous, they may be more furtive in their food-gathering behavior. On bare pastures, they are heavily preyed upon by northern flickers (Colaptes auratus). They are also the main target species for raids by the slave-making ant Polyergus lucidus, which steals the pupae and late-stage larvae.

There is also a lot of research on the consequences of holding prejudiced beliefs and being the target of such beliefs. It is true that advances have been made in understanding the nature of prejudice. A consensus on how to end prejudice has yet to be established, but there are a number of scientifically examined strategies that have been developed in attempt to solve this social issue. Intergroup interaction approaches Intergroup interaction approaches to prejudice reduction refer to strategies in which members of one group are put in situations where they have to interact with members of another group that they may hold prejudiced beliefs about. For example, if people from Group X are prejudiced towards people from Group Y or vice versa, an intergroup approach would require at least one person from Group X to interact with at least one person from Group Y. The expectation is that prejudice will decrease following a specified type of interaction. Intergroup approaches to prejudice reduction have been studied a great deal in laboratory settings, as well as outside of the laboratory, particularly in schools.Paluck, E. L., & Green, D. P. (2009). Prejudice reduction: What works? A review and assessment of research and practice. Annual Review of Psychology, 60, 339-367. Many intergroup prejudice reduction approaches are grounded in one of 3 main theoretical perspectives: interdependence,Deutsch, M. (1949). A theory of cooperation and competition. Human Relations, 2, 129-152. intergroup contact,Allport, G.W. (1954). The nature of prejudice. Reading, MA: Addison- Wesley. and social identity.Tajfel, H., & Turner, J. (1979). An integrative theory of intergroup conflict. In W. Austin & S. Worchel (Eds.), The social psychology of intergroup relations (pp. 33-47). Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole. =Interdependence approaches= Interdependence approaches to prejudice reduction are based on psychologist, Morton Deutsch's, theory of interdependence. According to this theory, when two groups realize that they have a common issue that can only be solved by pooling their resources together, they are more likely to engage in cooperative behaviors. Cooperation then results in friendliness during discussion and positive evaluations of the individuals from the opposite group.Deutsch, M. (1949). An experimental study of the effects of co-operation and competition upon group process. Human Relations, 2, 199-232. Cooperative learning is an interdependence approach originally developed for the purpose of reducing racial prejudice in schools. It is most frequently examined in school settings, and studies testing this approach often occur across weeks. This approach is most frequently associated with the “jigsaw method” created by social psychologist, Elliot Aronson. With this method, students are put into diverse teams of 5 or 6 people and assigned to complete a task. Each person is given a unique part of the total material necessary for solving the task. Thus, in order to complete the task, team members have to work together, each sharing their unique information with the others.Aronson, E., Blaney, N., Stephan, C., Sikes, J., & Snapp, M. (1978). The jigsaw classroom. Beverly Hills, CA: Sage. The jigsaw method has been shown to actually reduce prejudice toward members of the stigmatized group. A stigmatized group is a group that “has an attribute that marks them as different and leads them to be devalued in the eyes of others”.Major, B., & O'Brien, L. T. (2005). The social psychology of stigma. Annual Review of Psychology, 56, 393-421. The stigmatized group in the context of the jigsaw method is typically a racial minority group. Getting members of the non-stigmatized group to engage in cooperative behaviors with members of the stigmatized group results in increased liking, increased perspective taking, and increased helping behaviors between the different group members. Another variation of cooperative learning is the competitive-cooperation method.Sharan, S. (1980). Cooperative learning in small groups: Recent methods and effects on achievement, attitudes, and ethnic relations. Review of Educational Research, 50(2), 241-271. With this method, the learning environment is set up such that students are assigned to diverse groups of 4-5 people and the diverse groups compete with each other in a weekly learning game tournament. Thus, group members are dependent on one another and cooperation is necessary in order for them to do well and outperform the other groups in the tournament. The same outcomes of liking, perspective taking and helping behavior are expected with this type of cooperative learning strategy. Overall, cooperative learning strategies have been quite effective in reducing prejudice. However, as cooperative learning is generally studied with children in school settings, it is not clear what its impact is on adults. Also, there is little research on whether or not the reduction of prejudice that students experience as a result of cooperative learning extends to their perceptions of the stigmatized group as a whole or just to those members that are part of their assigned cooperative learning group.Warring, D., Johnson, D. W., Maruyama, G., & Johnson, R. T. (1985). Impact of different types of cooperative learning on cross-ethnic and cross-sex relationships. Journal of Educational Psychology, 77(1), 53-59. =Intergroup contact approaches= Contact approaches to prejudice reduction are based on prominent social psychologist, Gordon Allport's, contact hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, prejudice is best reduced under optimal conditions of contact between those who hold prejudiced beliefs and those who are the targets of prejudiced beliefs. The optimal conditions include equal status between groups in the context of the given situation, shared goals, authority support, and cooperation as opposed to competition.Pettigrew, T. F., & Tropp, L. R. (2006). A meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 90(5), 751-783. (This does overlap with the cooperative learning strategy discussed above.) Stuart Cook's “railroad studies” Cook, S. W. (1971). The effect of unintended interracial contact upon racial interaction and attitude change. Project No. 5–1320, Final Report. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.Cook, S. W. (1978). Interpersonal and attitudinal outcomes in cooperating interracial groups. Journal of Research & Development in Education, 12(1), 97-113. are classic examples of the contact hypothesis put into practice. These railroad studies took place in the American South during the 1960s, an especially challenging time and place with respect to interracial relations. In these studies, racially prejudiced white adults were hired to perform a railroad management task with two coworkers under the guise that they were employed at a real part-time job. Unbeknownst to them, the two coworkers – one White and one Black – were research assistants. After working with the two coworkers for over a month under optimal conditions, the initially prejudiced white participants rated their coworkers highly in attractiveness, likeability, and competence. Moreover, several months later, participants still expressed lower prejudice than prejudiced whites that did not have the intergroup contact experience. =Social identity approaches= According to social identity theory, people are biased to favor their ingroup – the group that they identify as belonging to – at the expense of the outgroup – the group that they do not identify with. Social identity-based approaches to prejudice reduction attempt to make a particular group-based identity, such as race or gender, less salient to individuals from different groups by emphasizing alternative ways of categorizing people. One way of making a particular group-based identity less salient is through decategorization. Decategorization involves teaching people from different social groups to focus on a person's unique individual characteristics.Ensari, N., & Miller, N. (2001). Decategorization and the reduction of bias in the crossed categorization paradigm. European Journal of Social Psychology, 31(2), 193-216. This is known as individuation, and helps to draw attention away from group differences and toward individual differences. Decategorization often causes ingroup members to perceive fewer similarities among themselves.Bettencourt, B., Brewer, M. B., Croak, M. R., & Miller, N. (1992). Cooperation and the reduction of intergroup bias: The role of reward structure and social orientation. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 28(4), 301-319. Another way of making a particular group-based identity less salient is through recategorization. Here, individuals with different group-based identities are made aware of the fact that the groups to which they belong are part of an overarching group. The salience of their membership in the overarching group is emphasized over their exclusive group based identities.Gaertner, S. L., & Dovidio, J. F. (2000). Reducing intergroup bias: The common ingroup identity model. Psychology Press. For example, membership in the group “student” would be emphasized over membership in the group “humanities major” or “sciences major”. Similar to recategorization, crossed categorization is when individuals from opposing groups are made aware of the fact that they both simultaneously belong to a third separate group, and membership in this third group is emphasized.Crisp, R. J., & Hewstone, M. (1999). Differential evaluation of crossed category groups: Patterns, processes, and reducing intergroup bias. Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 2(4), 307-333. For example, membership the group “military veteran” would be emphasized over membership in the group “humanities major” or “sciences major ”. Integrative models acknowledge the coexistence of separate group-based identities within a common group identity. This is in alignment with multicultural ideologies that emphasize appreciation for racial and ethnic diversity while still emphasizing a common national identity. Because divisive group membership is deemphasized in these categorization strategies, people from opposing groups express less ingroup favoritism. However, they do not necessarily show a reduction of bias against the outgroup. This approach has primarily been studied in laboratory settings and often with arbitrarily assigned group categories.Tajfel, H. (1970). Experiments in intergroup discrimination. Scientific American, 223(5), 96-102. It is not entirely clear how these results translate when considering existing social groups in real- world settings. =Disclosure approaches= Disclosure approaches rely on self-disclosure of personal information. Here, two individuals from different social groups would each reveal a piece of personal information about themselves. The act of disclosure signals vulnerability. This increases trust and liking, and that then results in a decrease of prejudiced beliefs.Ensari, N., & Miller, N. (2002). The out-group must not be so bad after all: the effects of disclosure, typicality, and salience on intergroup bias. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83(2), 313. It is not clear if the decrease in prejudice extends beyond the disclosing individual to the social group to which that person belongs. Individual approaches Individual approaches to prejudice reduction are not dependent on intergroup interaction. These approaches only require that an individual be exposed to some relevant information and/or engage in an activity intended to reduce prejudice. There are two main types of individual approaches to prejudice reduction: affective strategies that target what and how you feel, and cognitive strategies that target what and how you think. A lot of the evidence on the effectiveness of affective and cognitive strategies is based on laboratory findings. As most of these studies consist of one-time sessions, it is unclear how long the positive effects of the strategies last. Also, there is not much knowledge about the extent to which these strategies are effective in situations outside of the laboratory. =Affective approaches= Perspective taking. Taking the perspective of an individual from a stigmatized group has been shown to be effective in reducing prejudice Galinsky, A. D., & Moskowitz, G. B. (2000). Perspective-taking: decreasing stereotype expression, stereotype accessibility, and in-group favoritism. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78(4), 708-724. because it evokes feelings of similarity and affinity toward the other person. Evidence from laboratory studies suggests that perspective taking specifically leads to a decrease in the use of stereotypes when categorizing or evaluating a member of a stigmatized group. Empathy. Encouraging individuals to be empathetic towards stigmatized groups is another feeling-based strategy. Being instructed to be empathetic after reading about Stephan, W. G., & Finlay, K. (1999). The role of empathy in improving intergroup relations. Journal of Social Issues, 55(4), 729-743. or watching videos of discrimination,Esses, V. M., & Dovidio, J. F. (2002). The role of emotions in determining willingness to engage in intergroup contact. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 28(9), 1202-1214. against a stigmatized group, such as African Americans, results in decreased expressions of prejudice, and a stronger willingness to engage in contact with members of the stigmatized group. =Cognitive approaches= Thought awareness and suppression. Increasing a person's awareness of his or her prejudiced thoughts and instructing that person to actively suppress those thoughts is a form of prejudice reduction that has been frequently studied in laboratory settings.Blair, I. V. (2002). The malleability of automatic stereotypes and prejudice. Personality and Social Psychology Review, 6(3), 242-261. However, suppression does not always reduce prejudice and sometimes has the opposite effect of increasing it.Kulik, C. T., Perry, E. L., & Bourhis, A. C. 2000. Ironic evaluation processes: effects of thought suppression on evaluations of older job applicants. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 21(6), 689–711. Attitude reconditioning. There are several strategies that attempt to recondition or retrain implicit prejudiced attitudes – attitudes that exist outside of a person's conscious awareness. One way of reconditioning implicit attitudes is through classical conditioning, whereby you pair a representation of a stigmatized group with positive images or positive words.Kawakami, K., Dovidio, J. F., Moll, J., Hermsen, S., & Russin, A. (2000). Just say no (to stereotyping): effects of training in the negation of stereotypic associations on stereotype activation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78(5), 871-888. While this is helpful in reducing implicit prejudice, it is not necessarily successful at changing conscious attitudes.Dasgupta, N., & Greenwald, A. G. (2001). On the malleability of automatic attitudes: combating automatic prejudice with images of admired and disliked individuals. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81(5), 800-814. Another method of reconditioning is known as Situational Attribution Training.Stewart, T. L., Latu, I. M., Kawakami, K., & Myers, A. C. (2010). Consider the situation: Reducing automatic stereotyping through Situational Attribution Training. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 46(1), 221-225. This training, based on the ultimate attribution error, reduces implicit prejudice by getting people to focus on situational explanations for negative behaviors displayed by members of stigmatized groups. Again, it is unclear if this leads to a decrease in conscious prejudiced attitudes. Thought process reconditioning. Some research suggests that teaching people how to engage in more complex thinking elicits less biased evaluations of outgroup members.Gardiner, G. S. (1972). Complexity training and prejudice reduction. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 2(4), 326-342.Schaller, M., Asp, C. H., Roseil, M. C., & Heim, S. J. (1996). Training in statistical reasoning inhibits the formation of erroneous group stereotypes. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 22(8), 829-844. For example, instructing people on how to apply statistical reasoning to everyday judgments leads people to make more accurate assessments of outgroup members. Experts and norms. When people are told that experts believe personality traits are changeable and learned, they decrease in their stereotyping of stigmatized groups.Levy, S. R., Stroessner, S. J., & Dweck, C. S. (1998). Stereotype formation and endorsement: The role of implicit theories. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74(6), 1421-1436. Also, stereotyping decreases when people are told that stereotyping of a particular stigmatized group is not the norm for their peers.Stangor, C., Sechrist, G. B., & Jost, J. T. (2001). Changing racial beliefs by providing consensus information. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 27(4), 486-496. Accountability and value consistency. Some prejudice reduction strategies rely on creating a sense of internal conflict. One such strategy involves holding people accountable for their prejudice. Prejudice has been shown to decrease when people are asked to provide concrete reasons for prejudiced beliefs. The process of generating these reasons gets people to consider the irrational nature of their prejudiced beliefs.Bodenhausen, G. V., Kramer, G. P., & Süsser, K. (1994). Happiness and stereotypic thinking in social judgment. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 66(4), 621-632. Another strategy is to get people to view prejudice as being inconsistent with their behaviors or valued attitudes. This creates cognitive dissonance, and people attempt to resolve this tension by reducing expressions of prejudice. For example, after agreeing to write a public statement advocating a policy that is beneficial to racial minorities but costly to whites, whites report more personal support for this policy than before being asked to write the public statement.Eisenstadt, D., Leippe, M. R., Rivers, J. A., & Stambush, M. (2003). Counterattitudinal Advocacy on a Matter of Prejudice: Effects of Distraction, Commitment, and Personal Importance1. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 33(10), 2123-2152. Self-affirmation. People are also less likely to endorse prejudiced beliefs when their own self-worth is affirmed. After being made to feel good about themselves, people are more likely to positively rate job candidates from stigmatized groups Fein, S., & Spencer, S. J. (1997). Prejudice as self-image maintenance: Affirming the self through derogating others. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73(1), 31-44. and less likely to negatively stereotype people from stigmatized groups.Sinclair, L., & Kunda, Z. (1999). Reactions to a black professional: motivated inhibition and activation of conflicting stereotypes. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77(5), 885-904. Integrated approaches Integrated approaches to prejudice reduction include both intergroup and individual components, such as vicarious intergroup contact, perspective taking, and empathy. Many of these integrated approaches involve some form of entertainment. After cooperative learning, entertainment-based interventions are the second most popular prejudice reduction strategy tested in non-laboratory settings. Reading interventions are particularly popular. Reading interventions. Reading interventions typically take place in schools and last an average of 5 weeks. They attempt to influence prejudiced beliefs through the use of engaging stories. Often these stories highlight positive interactions between children who are similar to those receiving the intervention and children who differ from them based on their membership in a stigmatized group. Furthermore, when an emphasis is placed on individual characteristics as opposed to group membership, an experience of vicarious intergroup friendship occurs, and this leads to more positive attitudes toward children from stigmatized groups.Cameron, L., & Rutland, A. (2006). Extended contact through story reading in school: Reducing children's prejudice toward the disabled. Journal of Social Issues, 62(3), 469-488. There is little knowledge, however, of how such interventions influence children's behavior in actual intergroup interactions. Prejudice reduction strategies not often studied Despite the fact that billions of dollars are spent on diversity training a year,Hansen, F. (2003). Diversity's business case doesn't add up. Workforce, 82(4), 28-32. workplace diversity training is not necessarily informed by prejudice reduction research, and its effectiveness in reducing prejudice has rarely been examined.Paluck, E. L. (2006). Diversity training and intergroup contact: A call to action research. Journal of Social Issues, 62(3), 577-595.

With the original buildings having been built between 1795 and 1809, the fort encloses 11 buildings: main gate, guardhouse, officers' quarters, powder magazine, and carpenter's shop. Fort Norfolk is the last remaining fortification of President George Washington's 18th century harbor defenses, later termed the first system of US fortifications. It has served as the district office for the U.S. Army Engineer District, Norfolk since 1923. and Accompanying photo It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and became a Virginia Landmark in 2013. Now it is preserved as a historic fort and is open to the public during the summer.Fort Norfolk at U.S. Army Engineer District, Norfolk website American Revolution Although private property at the time, the site of Fort Norfolk was first fortified by citizens of Norfolk during the American Revolutionary War in order provide harbor defense. The fort is located at a point where the Elizabeth River narrows and was used in conjunction with Fort Nelson on the opposite bank of the river in Portsmouth. This was done with the aim of providing a crossfire on any ships attempting to bombard and/or conduct an amphibious assault on Norfolk, Portsmouth, or the Gosport Navy Yard. Ultimately this failed as these positions were too weak to prevent a naval bombardment on Norfolk, later known as the Burning of Norfolk, by Lord Dunmore on January 1, 1776. At the time, Norfolk had been largely abandoned by its mostly pro-British Tory population. Patriot Whig forces made some effort to repel British landing parties, but did nothing to put out the fires and looted abandoned Tory properties. Construction In 1794 Congress authorized President George Washington to build defensive fortifications along what they determined the \\"Maritime Frontier\\" in order to defend American harbors. This was later termed the first system of US fortifications. By 1795, construction was largely complete on Fort Norfolk. It was originally built with earthen walls and utilized either wooden or brick supports. The northern, eastern, and southern facing sides are designed after a Vauban style star fort. The western side resembles a half moon shape and is called a semicircular bastion. This was an experimental design and the purpose was to maximize the number of cannon overlooking the river. While the design of a semicircular bastion is vulnerable to a land assault, this section of the fort is on the eastern bank of the Elizabeth River; therefore, it was not susceptible to a land assault. In 1797, records showed that Fort Norfolk had only a small caretaker garrison. In 1798 the fort was garrisoned with one company due to the start of the Quasi-War with France. In 1795 Captain Richard S. Blackburn's company was being formed, and by 1799 the company garrisoned both Fort Norfolk and Fort Nelson. War of 1812 In 1807–1809 the fort was completely rebuilt with masonry, with a capacity of 30 guns and barracks for two companies, as part of the second system of US fortifications.Fort Norfolk at American Forts NetworkFort Norfolk at FortWiki.com The defensive sea wall was reinforced to reach 12 feet high and 20 feet thick. The eastern and northern inland-facing sides continued to mimic a star fort. A ravelin was added on the east side of the fort to further reinforce the fort in preparation of a land assault. Additionally, this provided needed protection to the Officers' Quarters building, (used as the Shell House during the Civil War) which also served as the center part the eastern perimeter wall. The fort's armament included nine 18-pounder cannons with large quantities of gunpowder, shot, and shell. Although Fort Norfolk itself never saw conflict, it was in operation during the War of 1812. An elongated chain was stretched from Fort Norfolk to Fort Nelson in order to prevent the British Fleet from attacking Gosport Navy Yard, Norfolk, and/or Portsmouth. During the War of 1812, soldiers stationed at Fort Norfolk were sent to reinforce the defense at Craney Island and took part in the Battle of Craney Island. Although the British were repulsed in that battle and did not enter Norfolk, they proceeded up Chesapeake Bay to burn Washington, D.C. and unsuccessfully attack Baltimore, as there were no forts guarding the mouth of the bay at the time. By the 1830s, the construction of Fort Monroe closed the entrance of Chesapeake Bay to potential enemies and made Fort Norfolk obsolete. Located outside of what were then the city limits, the fort remained standing but it was ungarrisoned. In 1853 local historian William S. Forrest described the fort as \\"long neglected, and is fast falling into ruins\\". Civil War Prior to the American Civil War, in 1849–1856 a naval powder magazine was added and used to assemble, store, and load munitions for ships built or repaired at what was then the Gosport Navy Yard, now known as Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Later, steps were taken to defend Norfolk from seceding armies. Fort Norfolk was again operational and a garrison company was assigned there. When Virginia seceded in 1861, the Union Army was forced to abandon both Norfolk and Fort Norfolk. The Confederate Army occupied Norfolk and Portsmouth; therefore, occupying both the fort and the Gosport Shipyard. Fort Norfolk was then used by the Confederate Army to defend the shipyard. The fort's newly added powder magazine also supplied Confederate ships attempting to break the Union blockade on Hampton Roads. The most famous of these encounters was the Battle of Hampton Roads between the ironclads USS Monitor and CSS Virginia (often referred to as the Merrimac(k) because it was previously the USS Merrimack). The Union Army reoccupied Fort Norfolk in May 1862 after General John E. Wool landed at Willoughby and marched on the city of Norfolk. This caused the Confederates to evacuate both the fort and the city, resulting in Norfolk's surrender. For the remainder of the Civil War, under Union occupation, Fort Norfolk was used to imprison captured Confederate blockade runners. Army Corps of Engineers The Army Corps of Engineers occupied Fort Norfolk in 1923 and used the fort as offices to plan engineering works for the east coast. During World War II, the fort continued to be used as offices for the Army Corps of Engineers, existing brick structures were renovated, and an additional structure for office use was built. In 1983, a new Army Corps of Engineers building was constructed next to Fort Norfolk, but they still retain offices in the fort. However, in collaboration with the Army Corps of Engineers, the Norfolk Historical Society began making restorations and giving tours of the fort in 1991.

They first met in the mid-1980s during Carsen's time as a student actor at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. Carsen, recognised as a rising star of opera direction, invited Kinmonth to design sets and costumes for his new production of Janáček's Kát'a Kabanová for the Canadian Opera Company. Their collaboration evolved over the next decade to deliver critically acclaimed stagings of, among others, Handel's Semele (co-produced by Vlaamse Opera and English National Opera),Wright, Helen (November 2004), \\"Semele\\" [online review of English National Opera's revival of Semele]. http://www.musicomh.com/opera/semele.htm; Seckerson, Edward (24 November 2004), “Semele, Coliseum, London”.

Kát'a Kabanová, conceived for Vlaamse Opera, has travelled extensively and was chosen to introduce the work to the Teatro alla Scala in 2006. It has also reached audiences in Tokyo, Strasbourg, Cologne and Madrid. The latter staging, filmed and subsequently released on DVD, was shortlisted for a Gramophone Award in 2009. Kinmonth's set and costume designs for Carsen's staging of La Traviata were commissioned by La Fenice for the Venetian theatre's post-fire reopening in 2004. The production was presented in Tokyo (2005) and in Beijing (2006) and has become established as the traditional season opener at La Fenice: the Carsen-Kinmonth production of La traviata was revived at the beginning of 2007/08, 2009/10, 2010/11, 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons. In 2000, Kinmonth worked for the first time with the director Pierre Audi. Their production of Handel's Tamerlano for the Slottsteater, Drottningholm was tailored to suit the unique atmosphere and intimacy of Sweden's eighteenth-century theatre. Baroque repertoire has occupied the centre ground of Kinmonth's collaborations with Audi. They presented Handel's Alcina (2003) and Rameau's Zoroastre (2005) at Drottningholm in productions which, together with Tamerlano, have since been revived at De Nederlandse Opera. Kinmonth joined forces with fellow designers Chloe Obolensky and Jannis Kounellis in 2007 to work with Pierre Audi for De Nederlandse Opera's 'Monteverdi Evening', comprising Lamento d'Arianna, Il ballo della ingrate and Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda. Audi and Kinmonth created a production of Handel's Partenope for Theater an der Wien in 2009 and in 2011 staged Vivaldi's Orlando furioso at the Théâtre des Champs- Elysées in Paris as well as in Nice and Nancy. Kinmonth's innate understanding and experience of creative partnerships have underpinned recent collaborations with the Flemish opera director Guy Joosten (Richard Strauss's Elektra, co- produced by Gran Teatre del Liceu and La Monnaie) and Brazilian dancer and choreographer Fernando Melo. He has designed sets and costumes for three of Melo's original dance works: A Guest House, created for and first staged by Göteborgsoperans Danskompani (2010); Fountain, a 20-minute dance theatre work produced at the Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz (2011), and Tending to Fall, also conceived for GöteborgsOperans (2012). =Opera Direction= Whilst Intendant of Cologne Opera, Christoph Dammann invited Kinmonth to make his directorial debut with Puccini's Madama Butterfly for the German company's 2008/09 season.

While the Nazi Fuhrer Adolf Hitler's public relationship to Religion in Nazi Germany may be defined as one of opportunism, his personal position on Catholicism and Christianity was one of hostility. Hitler's chosen \\"deputy\\", Martin Bormann, an atheist, recorded in Hitler's Table Talk that Nazism was secular, scientific and anti-religious in outlook.

In the 1930s, the Catholic Church and the Catholic Centre Party (Zentrum) were major social and political forces in predominantly Protestant Germany. Through the period of the Weimar Republic (1919–33/34) the Centre Party, aligned with both the Social Democrats and the leftist German Democratic Party, had maintained the centre ground against the rise of extremist parties of the left and right.Yad Vashem - The German Churches in the Third Reich by Franklin F. Littell Historically the Centre Party had had the strength to defy Bismark and been a bulwark of the Weimar Republic, yet, according to Bullock, from the summer of 1932, the Party had become \\"notoriously a Party whose first concern was to make accommodation with any government in power in order to secure the protection of its particular interests\\".Alan Bullock; Hitler: a Study in Tyranny; Harper Perennial Edition 1991; pp. 138, 148 It remained relatively moderate during the radicalisation of German politics which occurred with the onset of the Great Depression, but the party's deputies ultimately voted for the Enabling Act of March 1933, with which Hitler obtained plenary powers.Centre Party; Encyclopædia Britannica Online; retrieved 28 September 2013 =Early Nazi movement= Catholic Bavaria resented rule from Protestant Berlin, and Hitler at first saw revolution in Bavaria as a means to power - but an early attempt proved fruitless, and he was imprisoned after the 1923 Munich Beerhall Putsch. He used the time to produce Mein Kampf, in which he argued that the effeminate Jewish-Christian ethic was enfeebling Europe, and that Germany needed a man of iron to restore itself and build an empire.Editors of Time-Life Books; Shadow of the Dictators; Time-LIfe Books; 1989; ; p.27 He decided on the tactic of pursuing power through \\"legal\\" means.Editors of Time-Life Books; Shadow of the Dictators; Time-Life Books; 1989; ; p.28 Hitler combined elements of autobiography with an exposition of his racist political ideology in Mein Kampf (\\"My Struggle\\"), published between 1925 and 1927.Encyclopædia Britannica Online - Mein Kampf; web 24 May 2013 Laurence Rees wrote that emphasis on Christianity is missing from Mein Kampf, and described the thrust of the work as \\"bleak nihilism\\" revealing a cold universe with no moral structure other than the fight between different people for supremacy.Laurence Rees; The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler; Ebury Press 2012; p. 135 Paul Berben wrote that insofar as the Christian denominations were concerned, Hitler declared himself to be neutral in Mein Kampf - but argued for clear separation between church and state, and for the church not to concern itself with the earthly life of the people, which must be the domain of the state.Berben, Paul (1975). Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945. Norfolk Press. ; p.138 According to William Shirer, Hitler \\"inveighed against political Catholicism in Mein Kampf and attacked both of the Christian Churches for their failure to recognise the racial problem...\\", while also warning that no political party could succeed in \\"producing a religious reformation\\".William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; p234 The 1920 Nazi Party Platform had promised to support freedom of religions with the caveat: \\"insofar as they do not jeopardize the state's existence or conflict with the moral sentiments of the Germanic race\\". It further proposed a definition of a \\"positive Christianity\\" which could combat the \\"Jewish-materialistic spirit\\". The attitude of the Nazi party membership to the Catholic Church ranged from tolerance to near total renunciation. =Nazis take power= Otto von Bismarck became Chancellor of Germany in 1871 and launched the Kulturkampf Culture Struggle against the Roman Catholic Church in Germany.

Evans wrote that Hitler believed that in the long run National Socialism and religion would not be able to co- exist, and stressed repeatedly that Nazism was a secular ideology, founded on modern science: \\"Science, he declared, would easily destroy the last remaining vestiges of superstition\\". Germany could not tolerate the intervention of foreign influences such as the Pope and \\"Priests, he said, were 'black bugs', 'abortions in black cassocks'\\".Richard J.

Kershaw wrote that they believed they would therefore have to replace class, religious and regional allegiances by a \\"massively enhanced national self-awareness to mobilize the German people psychologically\\" for the coming struggle and war.Ian Kershaw; The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation; 4th Edn; Oxford University Press; New York; 2000\\"; pp. 173–74 Gill wrote that their long term plan was to \\"de-Christianise Germany after the final victory\\". Aggressive anti-Church radicals like Joseph Goebbels and Martin Bormann saw the conflict with the Churches as a priority concern, and anti-church and anti-clerical sentiments were strong among grassroots party activists. According to Shirer, \\"under the leadership of Rosenberg, Bormann and Himmler—backed by Hitler—the Nazi regime intended to destroy Christianity in Germany, if it could, and substitute the old paganism of the early tribal Germanic gods and the new paganism of the Nazi extremists.\\" The Nazi party had decidedly pagan elements. Once the war was over, Hitler wanted to root out and destroy the influence of the churches:.Alan Bullock; Hitler: a Study in Tyranny; Harper Perennial Edition 1991; p. 219 The Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels. Born to a Catholic family, he later led the regime's persecution of Catholic clergy, and wrote that there was \\"an insoluble opposition between the Christian and a heroic- German world view\\". Martin Bormann, Hitler's \\"deputy\\" from 1941, saw Nazism and Christianity as \\"incompatible\\" and had a particular loathing for the Semitic origins of Christianity.Encyclopædia Britannica Online: Fascism - Identification with Christianity; 2013; web 14 Apr. 2013 Hitler possessed radical instincts in relation to the kirchenkampf campaign against the Churches, and though he occasionally spoke of wanting to delay the Church struggle and was prepared to restrain his anticlericalism out of political considerations, his \\"own inflammatory comments gave his immediate underlings all the license they needed to turn up the heat in the 'Church Struggle, confident that they were 'working towards the Fuhrer'\\". Raised Catholic, Hitler retained some regard for the organisational power of the Church, but had utter contempt for its central teachings, which he said, if taken to their conclusion, \\"would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure\\". However, important conservative elements, such as the officer corps, opposed Nazi persecution of the churches and, in office, Hitler restrained his anticlerical instincts out of political considerations.Alan Bullock; Hitler: a Study in Tyranny; Harper Perennial Edition 1991; p. 236 Once in power, the Nazi leadership co-opted the term Gleichschaltung to mean conformity and subservience to the Nazi Party line: \\"there was to be no law but Hitler, and ultimately no god but Hitler\\". But Hitler was conscious that Bismark's kulturkampf struggle against the Church of the 1870s had been defeated by the unity of Catholics behind the Centre Party and was convinced that the Nazi movement could only succeed if Political Catholicism and its democratic networks were eliminated. In January 1934, Hitler appointed Alfred Rosenberg as the cultural and educational leader of the Reich. Rosenberg was a neo-pagan and notoriously anti-Catholic.The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942 Rosenberg was initially the editor of the young Nazi Party's newspaper, the Volkischer Beobachter.Editors of Time-Life Books; Shadow of the Dictators; Time-LIfe Books; 1989; ; p. 25–26 In 1924, following Hitler's arrest, Hitler had chosen Rosenberg to oversee the Nazi movement while he was in prison (though this may have been because he was unsuitable for the task and unlikely to emerge as a rival).Laurence Rees; The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler; Ebury Press 2012; p. 66 In \\"Myth of the Twentieth Century\\" (1930), Rosenberg described the Catholic Church as one of the main enemies of Nazism.Encyclopædia Britannica Online - Alfred Rosenberg; web 25 April 2013. Rosenberg proposed to replace traditional Christianity with the neo-pagan \\"myth of the blood\\": Church officials were perturbed by Hitler's appointment of Rosenberg as the state's official philosopher. The indication was that Hitler was endorsing Rosenberg's anti- Jewish, anti-Christian, and neo-pagan philosophy. The Vatican directed the Holy Office to place Rosenberg's Myth of the Twentieth Century on the Index of Forbidden books on February 7, 1934.Gill, Anton (1994).

The son of a Catholic family from Rheydt in the Rhineland, he became one of the regime's most relentless Jew-baiters.Fest, The Face of the Third Reich, pp. 134, 145 Goebbels led the Nazi persecution of the clergy. On the \\"Church Question\\", he wrote \\"after the war it has to be generally solved ... There is, namely, an insoluble opposition between the Christian and a heroic-German world view\\". Heinrich Himmler (L) and Reinhard Heydrich (R) headed the Nazi security forces and were key architects of the Final Solution. Both believed that Christian values were among the enemies of Nazism. Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich headed the Nazi security forces and were key architects of the Final Solution. Both believed that Christian values were among the enemies of Nazism: the enemies were \\"eternally the same\\" wrote Heydrich: \\"the Jew, the Freemason, and the politically-oriented cleric.\\" Modes of thinking like Christian and liberal individualism he considered to be residue of inherited racial characteristics, biologically sourced to Jewry—who must therefore be exterminated.United States Holocaust Memorial Museum—Reihard Heydrich; web 23 May 2013 According to Himmler biographer Peter Longerich, Himmler was vehemently opposed to Christian sexual morality and the \\"principle of Christian mercy\\", both of which he saw as a dangerous obstacle to his plans battle with \\"subhumans\\".Peter Longerich; Heinrich Himmler; Translated by Jeremy Noakes and Lesley Sharpe; Oxford University Press; 2012; p.265 In 1937 he wrote:Peter Longerich; Heinrich Himmler; Translated by Jeremy Noakes and Lesley Sharpe; Oxford University Press; 2012; p.270 Himmler saw the main task of his Schutzstaffel (SS) organisation to be that of \\"acting as the vanguard in overcoming Christianity and restoring a 'Germanic' way of living\\" in order to prepare for the coming conflict between \\"humans and subhumans\\": Longerich wrote that, while the Nazi movement as a whole launched itself against Jews and Communists, \\"by linking de-Christianisation with re-Germanization, Himmler had provided the SS with a goal and purpose all of its own.\\" He set about making his SS the focus of a \\"cult of the Teutons\\".Peter Longerich; Heinrich Himmler; Translated by Jeremy Noakes and Lesley Sharpe; Oxford University Press; 2012; p.269 Hitler's chosen deputy and private secretary from 1941, Martin Bormann, was a rigid guardian of National Socialist orthodoxy.Encyclopædia Britannica Online - Martin Bormann; web 25 April 2013 He believed, and said publicly in 1941 that \\"National Socialism and Christianity are irreconcilable\\". Following the failure of the pro-Nazi Ludwig Muller to unite Protestants behind the Nazi Party in 1933, Hitler appointed his friend Hans Kerrl as Minister for Church Affairs in 1935. A relative moderate among Nazis, Kerrl nonetheless confirmed Nazi hostility to the Catholic and Protestant creeds in a 1937 address during an intense phase of the Nazi Kirchenkampf:William Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; pp. 238–39 =During the war= Hitler called a truce in the Church conflict with the outbreak of war, wanting to back away from policies likely to cause internal friction in Germany. He decreed at the outset of war that \\"no further action should be taken against the Evangelical and Catholic Churches for the duration of the war\\". According to John Conway, \\"The Nazis had to reckon with the fact that, despite all Rosenberg's efforts, only 5 per cent of the population registered themselves at the 1930 census as no longer connected with Christian Churches.\\"John S. Conway; The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933-1945; Regent College Publishing; p. 232 The support of millions of German Christians was needed in order for Hitler's plans to come to fruition. It was Hitler's belief that if religion is a help, \\"it can only be an advantage\\". Most of the 3 million Nazi Party members \\"still paid the Church taxes\\" and considered themselves Christians.John S. Conway; The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933-1945; Regent College Publishing; p. 233 Regardless, a number of Nazi radicals in the hierarchy determined that the Church Struggle should be continued.John S. Conway; The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933-1945; Regent College Publishing; p. 235 Following victory in Poland, the repression of the Churches was extended, despite their early protestations of loyalty to the cause.John S. Conway; The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933-1945; Regent College Publishing; p. 237 Goebbels' Ministry of Propaganda issued threats and applied intense pressure on the Churches to voice support for the war, and the Gestapo banned Church meetings for a few weeks. In the first few months of the war, the German Churches complied.John S. Conway; The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933-1945; Regent College Publishing; p. 234 The Catholic bishops asked their followers to support the war effort.The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933-1945 By John S. Conway p. 234; Regent College Publishing But the Nazis strongly disapproved of the sentiments against war expressed by the Pope through his first encyclical, Summi Pontificatus and his 1939 Christmas message, and were angry at his support for Poland and the \\"provocative\\" use of Vatican Radio by Cardinal Hlond of Poland. Distribution of the encyclical was banned.John S. Conway; The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933-1945; Regent College Publishing; p. 240 Conway wrote that anti-church radical Reinhard Heydrich estimated in a report to Hitler of October 1939, that the majority of Church people were supporting the war effort - though a few \\"well known agitators among the pastors needed to be dealt with\\". Heydrich determined that support from church leaders could not be expected because of the nature of their doctrines and internationalism, so he devised measures to restrict the operation of the Churches under cover of war time exigencies, such as reducing resources available to Church presses on the basis of rationing, and prohibiting pilgrimages and large church gatherings on the basis of transportation difficulties. Churches were closed for being \\"too far from bomb shelters\\". Bells were melted down. Presses were closed. With the expansion of the war in the East from 1941, there came also an expansion of the regime's attack on the churches. Monasteries and convents were targeted and expropriation of Church properties surged.John S. Conway; The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933-1945; Regent College Publishing; p. 255 Clergy in the German Resistance had some independence from the state apparatus, and could thus criticise it, while not being close enough to the centre of power to take steps to overthrow it.Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 131–3 Mary Fulbrook wrote that when politics encroached on the church, Catholics were prepared to resist, but that the record was otherwise patchy and uneven, and that, with notable exceptions, \\"it seems that, for many Germans, adherence to the Christian faith proved compatible with at least passive acquiescence in, if not active support for, the Nazi dictatorship\\".Mary Fulbrook; The Fontana History of Germany: 1918–1990 The Divided Nation; Fontana Press; 1991; pp. 80–81 A senior cleric could rely on a degree of popular support from the faithful, and thus the regime had to consider the possibility of nationwide protests if such figures were arrested.Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 133 While hundreds of ordinary priests and members of monastic orders were sent to concentration camps throughout the Nazi period, just one German Catholic bishop was briefly imprisoned in a concentration camp, and just one other expelled from his diocese.Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 196–7 This reflected also the cautious approach adopted by the hierarchy, who felt secure only in commenting on matters which transgressed on the ecclesiastical sphere.Theodore S.

In a 1942 Table Talk he said: \\"The fact that I remain silent in public over Church affairs is not in the least misunderstood by the sly foxes of the Catholic Church, and I am quite sure that a man like Bishop von Galen knows full well that after the war I shall extract retribution to the last farthing\\".Hitler's Table Talk 1941–1944, Cameron & Stevens, Enigma Books pp. 90, 555.

It was situated on Stanley Avenue in the London Borough of Brent. Consecrated in 1912, the Church was declared to be a redundant church on the February 7, 1989, and was subsequently demolished in 1990 to make way for a replacement modern church, St James Church Centre. Foundation The church was built to replace temporary previous arrangements, which had included a missionary's tent, and at one point, a church made out of corrugated iron from 1896. A chapel belonging to the Baptists had been in place since 1828, but Alperton was not made an Anglican parish in its own right until 1904, and had previously been served by St John the Evangelist Church, Wembley. However, the process was not entirely smooth, and there was an ongoing boundary dispute between the two parishes which continued from 1911 to 1954. Construction By the early 20th century, a movement of population from the Wealdstone area had made the construction of a more lasting structure a necessity, which was designed by the architect William Pite, brother of Arthur Beresford Pite in the Gothic Revival style. The church was described as being constructed from yellow stock brick, with a dressing of stone and red brick. The church featured the customary main body of the nave and chancel, a transept on the south end of the building, and, in addition, a baptistery in the north west, a chapel in the north east, and a porch – the narthex. St James Church also had its own bell tower which was described as a ‘turret’. There was also an associated church hall as early as 1914. The church’s organ was donated, coming from St Peter's Italian Church, in Clerkenwell, central London, and was originally gas lit. It was later updated to include a boiler room, and the organ was later replaced, probably by 1929, by another donated item, described as coming from Saint Mark's, Whitechapel in the late 1920s. At a later stage, a Compton Electronic organ was installed – an electric lighting system was in place by 1930. The church also had stained windows, some of which were in place as memorials to prominent members of the congregation. Redundancy and demolition By 1989, the now redundant church had been scheduled for demolition, and the London Diocese Fund had earmarked part of the site for a new place of worship, with the remainder to go, by sale or lease, to Bellway homes for redevelopment under Section 46 (Pastoral Scheme), which deals with places of worship that are unsuitable for present needs, and specifies how, when part of a site is sold or leased, the proceeds can then be used to create a new place of worship. A new place of worship In 1990, a new church, St James Church Centre, had been constructed on the site, designed by the K C White Partnership of Essex. The new church’s mission statement describes it as a multicultural and multilingual place of worship, and offers services in Tamil, Urdu and Hindi.

She served on the Judiciary Committee in the Georgia House. In 2015, Evans helped stop Josh McKoon's religious liberty bill from becoming law. She fought to include civil rights protections in the bill and then joined with the majority of her colleagues on the House Judiciary committee in voting to table the legislation. She was commended for her work by Georgia Equality. Work on HOPE Scholarship In the legislature, she quickly became known as a fighter for HOPE. She opposed the changes pushed by Governor Nathan Deal and Georgia legislative leaders that, Evans claimed, would push many Georgians off of the scholarship and out of school. The HOPE Scholarship program began by promising that all those who graduated from Georgia high schools with a B average would be able to go to college with the cost paid for by taxpayers. Despite the opposition of Evans, a proposal was made to limit the full scholarship only to those who achieved a 3.7 GPA and 1200 on the SAT. Evans responded by claiming that this would prevent many of the students who most needed the help from attending college at all and said in remarks to the House chamber that had these limitations been in place when she graduated from college she wouldn't be standing there that day. In the end, the proposal to limit the scholarship was successful. 2018 Georgia gubernatorial race Representative Evans ran for governor of Georgia in the 2018 Democratic primary election. She lost in the primary election to former state representative and House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, who ultimately lost to conservative Republican Brian Kemp amid allegations of electoral improprieties.

Life His father was Edmund Waring and his mother the daughter of Richard Broughton, of Owlbury in the parish of Bishops Castle in Shropshire, and niece of Hugh Broughton. He was educated at Westminster School; he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 24 February 1632, graduating B.A. on 20 June 1634 and M.A. on 26 April 1637. During the First English Civil War Waring bore arms for the king at Oxford. He was elected proctor on 29 April 1647 and Camden professor of ancient history on 2 August that year. A protest against the election was made by Charles Wheare, son of the previous professor Degory Wheare, who had been given the place by the parliamentary visitors. According to the statutes Waring was not eligible, being in holy orders. He took an active part in resisting the proceedings of the visitors. Disregarding their order for his removal from his post of proctor, he was pronounced by them guilty of contempt of the authority of parliament on 14 December 1647. it John Selden interceded, and Waring avoided banishment from the university. Waring was then summoned to London on 6 April 1648, was ordered into custody, but escaped again to Oxford. On 14 September of that year he was deprived of his proctorship, professorship, and student's place. He retired to Apley in Shropshire, the seat of Sir William Whitmore, with whom he subsequently visited France. Waring died unmarried in Lincoln's Inn Fields on 10 May 1658, and was buried at St. Michael's, College Hill. His will was proved on 20 May 1658 by his sister and sole executrix, Anne Staunton. Works Waring published: * A publike Conference betwixt the six Presbyterian Ministers and some Independent Commanders at Oxford, 12 Nov. 1646 (anon.) 1646. * An Account of Mr. Pryn's Refutation of the University of Oxford's Plea, Oxford, 1648. * Amoris Effigies (anon.), London, 1649, 1664, 1668, 1671. In 1680 appeared a loose English translation, by a Robert Nightingale, which deviated in many points from the Latin original. John Norris, under the pseudonym Phil-iconerus, published a fresh translation, London, 1682; 2nd edit., 1701; 4th edit., 1744. In his introduction, Norris wrote of Waring's \\"sweetness of fancy, neatness of style, and lusciousness of hidden sense\\". Waring also wrote Latin verses, including in Jonsonus Virbius (1639), reprinted in the 1668 and subsequent editions of the Amoris Effigies, under the title of Carmen Lapidorium.

The Nazis claimed jurisdiction over all collective and social activity and the party leadership hoped to dechristianize Germany in the long term. Clergy were watched closely, and frequently denounced, arrested and sent to Nazi concentration camps. Welfare institutions were interfered with or transferred to state control. Catholic schools, press, trade unions, political parties and youth leagues were eradicated. Anti-Catholic propaganda and \\"morality\\" trials were staged. Monasteries and convents were targeted for expropriation. Prominent Catholic lay leaders were murdered, and thousands of Catholic activists were arrested. In all, an estimated one third of German priests faced some form of reprisal in Nazi Germany and 400 German priests were sent to the dedicated Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp. Persecution of the Church in Germany was at its most severe in the annexed Polish regions. Here the Nazis set about systematically dismantling the Church and most priests were murdered, deported or forced to flee. Of the 2,720 clergy imprisoned at Dachau from Germany and occupied territories, 2,579 (or 94.88%) were Catholic.

In his history of the German Resistance, Hamerow wrote:Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 132 Persecution in Germany Following the war, the American Office of Strategic Services collected evidence for the Nuremberg Trials on the nature and extent of the Nazi persecution of the churches. Different steps it noted included the campaign for the suppression of denominational and youth organisations, the campaign against denominational schools, and the defamation campaign against the clergy.Nazi trial documents made public, BBC, 11 January 2002 In a report entitled The Nazi Master Plan: The Persecution of the Christian Churches, the OSS said: Adalbert Probst, national director of the Catholic Youth Sports Association, murdered in the Night of the Long Knives Hitler moved quickly to eliminate Political Catholicism. The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German Centre Party. The Catholic Bavarian People's Party government had been overthrown by a Nazi coup on 9 March 1933.William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; p. 201 Two thousand functionaries of the Party were rounded up by police in late June, and it, along with the national Centre Party, was dissolved in early July. The dissolution left modern Germany without a Catholic Party for the first time. Vice Chancellor Papen meanwhile negotiated a Reich Concordat with the Vatican, which prohibited clergy from participating in politics.Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W.W. Norton & Co; London; p. 290 Kershaw wrote that the Vatican was anxious to reach agreement with the new government, despite \\"continuing molestation of Catholic clergy, and other outrages committed by Nazi radicals against the Church and its organisations\\".Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W.W.

Days later, moves began to dissolve the Catholic Youth League.William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; pp. 234–35 Political Catholicism was also among the targets of Hitler's 1934 Long Knives purge: those executed included the head of Catholic Action, Erich Klausener; Papen's speech writer and advisor Edgar Jung (also a Catholic Action worker); and the national director of the Catholic Youth Sports Association, Adalbert Probst. Former Centre Party Chancellor Heinrich Brüning narrowly escaped execution.Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933–1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p 25John S.

The great majority were not moved to face imprisonment for the sake of freedom of worship, being too impressed by Hitler's early successes. Few, he said, paused to reflect that the Nazi regime intended to destroy Christianity and substitute the old paganism of the early tribal Germanic gods and the new paganism of the Nazi extremists.William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; p. 240 Anti-Nazi sentiment grew in Catholic circles as the Nazi government increased its repressive measures. Hoffmann writes that, from the beginning:Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933–1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.14 =Himmler and the SS= Under Himmler's deputy, Reinhard Heydrich, the Security Police and SD were responsible for suppressing enemies of the Nazi state, including \\"political churches\\" - such as Lutheran and Catholic clergy who opposed the Hitler regime. Such dissidents were arrested and sent to concentration camps.United States Holocaust Memorial Museum - Reihard Heydrich; web 23 May 2013 According to Himmler biographer Peter Longerich, Himmler was vehemently opposed to Christian sexual morality and the \\"principle of Christian mercy\\", both of which he saw as a dangerous obstacle to his planned battle with \\"subhumans\\".Peter Longerich; Heinrich Himmler; Translated by Jeremy Noakes and Lesley Sharpe; Oxford University Press; 2012; p.265 In 1937 he wrote:Peter Longerich; Heinrich Himmler; Translated by Jeremy Noakes and Lesley Sharpe; Oxford University Press; 2012; p.270 Heinrich Himmler (L) and Reinhard Heydrich (R) were vehement anti- Catholics. Himmler saw the main task of his Schutzstaffel (SS) organisation to be that of \\"acting as the vanguard in overcoming Christianity and restoring a 'Germanic' way of living\\" in order to prepare for the coming conflict between \\"humans and subhumans\\": Longerich wrote that, while the Nazi movement as a whole launched itself against Jews and Communists, \\"by linking de- Christianisation with re-Germanization, Himmler had provided the SS with a goal and purpose all of its own.\\" He set about making his SS the focus of a \\"cult of the Teutons\\".Peter Longerich; Heinrich Himmler; Translated by Jeremy Noakes and Lesley Sharpe; Oxford University Press; 2012; p.269 =Targeting of clergy= Clergy, nuns and lay leaders were targeted following the Nazi takeover, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or \\"immorality\\". Priests were watched closely and frequently denounced, arrested and sent to concentration camps.Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ; p. 142 From 1940, a dedicated Clergy Barracks had been established at Dachau concentration camp.Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ; p. 145 Intimidation of clergy was widespread. Cardinal Faulhaber was shot at. Cardinal Innitzer had his Vienna residence ransacked in October 1938 and Bishop Sproll of Rottenburg was jostled and his home vandalised. In 1937, the New York Times reported that Christmas would see \\"several thousand Catholic clergymen in prison.\\" Propaganda satirized the clergy, including Anderl Kern's play The Last Peasant. In the 1936 campaign against the monasteries and convents, the authorities charged 276 members of religious orders with the offence of homosexuality.Joachim Fest; Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933–1945; Weidenfeld & Nicolson; London; p.373 1935-6 was the height of the \\"immorality\\" trials against priests, monks, lay-brothers and nuns. In the United States, protests were organised in response to the trials, including a June 1936, petition signed by 48 clergymen, including rabbis and Protestant pastors: \\"We lodge a solemn protest against the almost unique brutality of the attacks launched by the German government charging Catholic clergy ... in the hope that the ultimate suppression of all Jewish and Christian beliefs by the totalitarian state can be effected.\\" Winston Churchill wrote disapprovingly in the British press of the regime's treatment of \\"the Jews, Protestants and Catholics of Germany\\".Evening Standard Article of 17 September 1937, noted by Martin Gilbert in Churchill and the Jews; p. 139 The regime had to consider the possibility of nationwide protests if prominent clerics were arrested.Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 133 While hundreds of ordinary clergy were sent to concentration camps, just one German Catholic bishop was briefly imprisoned in a concentration camp, and just one other expelled from his diocese.Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 196–7 This reflected also the cautious approach adopted by the hierarchy, who felt secure only in commenting on matters which transgressed on the ecclesiastical sphere.Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 197 Documents used in evidence at the Nuremberg Trials show that the Nazis were cautious with regard to the murder of church leaders, and conscious of not wanting to create martyrs. Nevertheless, Catholic leaders frequently faced violence or the threat of violence, particularly at the hands of the SA, the SS or Hitler Youth. A number of cases were cited by the OSS, including three demonstrations against Bishop Sproll of Rottenburg in 1938, one against Archbishop Klein of Paderborn, two attacks against Bishop Bornewasser of Trier, and various against Cardinal Faulhaber.The Nazi Master Plan: Annex 4 From 1940, the Gestapo launched an intense persecution of the monasteries. The Provincial of the Dominican Province of Teutonia, Laurentius Siemer, a spiritual leader of the German Resistance was influential in the Committee for Matters Relating to the Orders, which formed in response to Nazi attacks against Catholic monasteries and aimed to encourage the bishops to intercede on behalf of the Orders and oppose the Nazi state more emphatically.Laurentius Siemer; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013Memory of Spiritual Leader in German Resistance Lives On; Deutsche Welle online; 21 October 2006 Figures like Galen and Preysing attempted to protect German priests from arrest.

Lapomarda writes that Hitler campaigned against the Jesuits, closing their schools and confiscating or destroying their property, imprisoning or exiling thousands, and killing 259 of them - including 152 who died in Nazi concentration camps. The superior of the Order in Germany, Fr Anton Rosch, was imprisoned, brutalised and scheduled for execution when rescued by Soviet troops at the end of the war.Edward Krause; Catholics against Hitler; First Things; November 1990. =Suppression of the Catholic press= Fritz Gerlich, editor of Munich's Catholic weekly, murdered in the Night of the Long Knives. The flourishing Catholic press of Germany faced censorship. Finally in March 1941 Goebbels banned all Church media, on the pretext of a \\"paper shortage\\".Fred Taylor; The Goebbells Diaries 1939–1941; Hamish Hamilton Ltd; London; 1982 p.278 & 294 In 1933, the Nazis established a Reich Chamber of Authorship and Reich Press Chamber under the Reich Cultural Chamber of the Ministry for Propaganda. Dissident writers were terrorised. The June–July 1934 Night of the Long Knives purge was the culmination of this campaign.Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933–1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p. 14–15 Fritz Gerlich, the editor of Munich's Catholic weekly, Der Gerade Weg, was killed in the purge for his strident criticism of the Nazi movement.John S.

He was arrested in the July Plot round up, and executed on 23 January 1945.Pope sets seven people on the path to sainthood; beatification opposed by man's son; Seattle Times; 8 October 2001Bl. Nikolaus Gross (1898–1945); Vatican News Service; retrieved 12 September 2013 =Suppression of Catholic education= When in 1933, the Nazi school superintendent of Munster issued a decree that religious instruction be combined with discussion of the \\"demoralising power\\" of the \\"people of Israel\\", Bishop Clemens von Galen of Münster refused, writing that such interference was a breach of the Concordat and that he feared children would be confused as to their \\"obligation to act with charity to all men\\" and as to the historical mission of the people of Israel.Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 139 Often Galen directly protested to Hitler over violations of the Concordat. When in 1936, Nazis removed crucifixes in school, protest by Galen led to public demonstration.Gill, Anton (1994). An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler. Heinemann Mandarin. 1995 paperback , p.59 Hitler sometimes allowed pressure to be placed on German parents to remove children from religious classes to be given ideological instruction in its place, while in elite Nazi schools, Christian prayers were replaced with Teutonic rituals and sun- worship.Encyclopedia Online - Fascism - Identification with Christianity; web 20 Apr 2013 Church kindergartens were closed, crucifixes were removed from schools and Catholic welfare programs were restricted on the basis they assisted the \\"racially unfit\\". Parents were coerced into removing their children from Catholic schools. In Bavaria, teaching positions formerly allotted to nuns were awarded to secular teachers and denominational schools transformed into \\"Community schools\\". When in 1937 the authorities in Upper Bavaria attempted to replace Catholic schools with \\"common schools\\", Cardinal Faulhaber offered fierce resistance.Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; pp. 200–202 By 1939 all Catholic denominational schools had been disbanded or converted to public facilities.Evans, Richard J. (2005). The Third Reich in Power. New York: Penguin. ; pp. 245–246 =Suppression of Catholic Trade Unions= The Catholic trade unions formed the left wing of the Catholic community in Germany. The Nazis moved quickly to suppress both the \\"Free\\" unions (Socialist) and the \\"Christian unions\\" (allied with the Catholic Church). In 1933 all unions were liquidated.https://www.teachers.org.uk/files/trade-unionists-leaflet.pdf Catholic union leaders arrested by the regime included Blessed Nikolaus Gross and Jakob Kaiser. =Interference in welfare organisations= From 1941, expropriation of Church properties surged. The Nazi authorities claimed that the properties were needed for wartime necessities such as hospitals, or accommodation for refugees or children, but in fact used them for their own purposes.John S. Conway; The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933–1945; Regent College Publishing; p. 255 Despite Nazi efforts to transfer hospitals to state control, large numbers of handicapped people were still under the care of the Churches when the Nazi commenced their infamous euthanasia program. While the Nazi Final Solution liquidation of the Jews took place primarily on German-occupied Polish territory, the murder of invalids took place on German soil and involved interference in Catholic (and Protestant) welfare institutions. Awareness of the murderous programme therefore became widespread, and the Church leaders who opposed it (such as the Bishop of Münster, Clemens August von Galen) were therefore able to rouse widespread public opposition.Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933-1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.24 On 6, 13 and 20 July 1941, Bishop von Galen spoke against the state seizure of properties and the expulsions of nuns, monks, and religious and criticised the euthanasia programme. In an attempt to cow Galen, the police raided his sister's convent, and detained her in the cellar. She escaped the confinement and Galen, who had also received news of the imminent removal of further patients, launched his most audacious challenge on the regime in a 3 August sermon. He declared the murders to be illegal and said that he had formally accused those responsible for murders in his diocese in a letter to the public prosecutor. Galen said that it was the duty of Christians to resist the taking of human life, even if it meant losing their own lives. The regional Nazi leader and Hitler's deputy Martin Bormann called for Galen to be hanged, but Hitler and Goebbels urged a delay in retribution till war's end. The intervention led to, in the words of Evans, \\"the strongest, most explicit and most widespread protest movement against any policy since the beginning of the Third Reich.\\" Nurses and staff (particularly in Catholics institutions) increasingly sought to obstruct implementation of the policy. Under pressure from growing protests, Hitler halted the main euthanasia program on 24 August 1941, though less systematic murder of the handicapped continued. =\\"War on the Church\\"= By late 1935, Bishop Clemens August von Galen of Münster was urging a joint pastoral letter protesting an \\"underground war\\" against the church. By early 1937, the church hierarchy in Germany, which had initially attempted to co-operate, had become highly disillusioned. In March, Pope Pius XI issued the Mit brennender Sorge encyclical - accusing the Nazi Government of violations of the 1933 Concordat, and further that it was sowing the \\"tares of suspicion, discord, hatred, calumny, of secret and open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church\\". The Nazis responded with an intensification of the Church Struggle, beginning around April. Goebbels noted heightened verbal attacks on the clergy from Hitler in his diary and wrote that Hitler had approved the start of \\"immorality trials\\" against clergy and anti-Church propaganda campaign. Goebbels' orchestrated attack included a staged \\"morality trial\\" of 37 Franciscans. At the outbreak of World War Two, Goebbels' Ministry of Propaganda applied intense pressure on the Churches to voice support for the war, and the Gestapo banned Church meetings for a few weeks. In the first few months of the war, the German Churches complied.John S. Conway; The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933–1945; Regent College Publishing; p. 234 No denunciations of the invasion of Poland, nor the Blitzkrieg were issued.The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933–1945 By John S. Conway p. 235; Regent College Publishing The Catholic bishops asked their followers to support the war effort: \\"We appeal to the faithful to join in ardent prayer that God's providence may lead this war to blessed success for Fatherland and people.\\"The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933–1945 By John S. Conway p. 234; Regent College Publishing Despite this, the anti-church radical Reinhard Heydrich determined that support from church leaders could not be expected because of the nature of their doctrines and internationalism, and wanted to cripple the political activities of clergy. He devised measures to restrict the operation of the Churches under cover of war time exigencies, such as reducing resources available to Church presses on the basis of rationing, and prohibiting pilgrimages and large church gatherings on the basis of transportation difficulties. Churches were closed for being \\"too far from bomb shelters\\". Bells were melted down. Presses were closed.John S. Conway; The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933–1945; Regent College Publishing; p. 237 With the expansion of the war in the East from 1941, there came also an expansion of the regime's attack on the churches. Monasteries and convents were targeted and expropriation of Church properties surged. The Nazi authorities claimed that the properties were needed for wartime necessities such as hospitals, or accommodation for refugees or children, but in fact used them for their own purposes. \\"Hostility to the state\\" was another common cause give for the confiscations, and the action of a single member of a monastery could result in seizure of the whole. The Jesuits were especially targeted. The Papal Nuncio Cesare Orsenigo and Cardinal Bertram complained constantly to the authorities but were told to expect more requisitions owing to war-time needs.John S. Conway; The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933–1945; Regent College Publishing; p. 257 The Nazi authorities decreed the dissolution of all monasteries and abbeys in the German Reich, many of them effectively being occupied and secularized by the Allgemeine SS under Himmler. However, on July 30, 1941 the Aktion Klostersturm (Operation Monastery) was put to an end by a decree of Hitler, who feared the increasing protests by the Catholic part of German population might result in passive rebellions and thereby harm the Nazi war effort at the eastern front.Mertens, Annette, Himmlers Klostersturm: der Angriff auf katholische Einrichtungen im Zweiten Weltkrieg und die Wiedergutmachung nach 1945, Paderborn; München ; Wien; Zürich : Schöningh, 2006, pp. 33, 120, 126. Over 300 monasteries and other institutions were expropriated by the SS.https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/08/world/europe/08iht- germany.4.11787437.html?_r=1& On 22 March 1942, the German Bishops issued a pastoral letter on \\"The Struggle against Christianity and the Church\\".Joachim Fest; Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933–1945; Weidenfeld & Nicolson; London; p. 377 The letter launched a defence of human rights and the rule of law and accused the Reich Government of \\"unjust oppression and hated struggle against Christianity and the Church\\", despite the loyalty of German Catholics to the Fatherland, and brave service of Catholics soldiers:The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; pp. 74–80. The letter outlined serial breaches of the 1933 Concordat, reiterated complaints of the suffocation of Catholic schooling, presses and hospitals and said that the \\"Catholic faith has been restricted to such a degree that it has disappeared almost entirely from public life\\" and even worship within churches in Germany \\"is frequently restricted or oppressed\\", while in the conquered territories (and even in the Old Reich), churches had been \\"closed by force and even used for profane purposes\\". The freedom of speech of clergymen had been suppressed and priests were being \\"watched constantly\\" and punished for fulfilling \\"priestly duties\\" and incarcerated in Concentration camps without legal process. Religious orders had been expelled from schools, and their properties seized, while seminaries had been confiscated \\"to deprive the Catholic priesthood of successors\\". The bishops denounced the Nazi euthanasia program and declared their support for human rights and personal freedom under God and \\"just laws\\" of all people: Priests of Dachau The regime incarcerated clergy who had opposed the Nazi regime in the Dachau Concentration Camp. In 1935, Wilhelm Braun, a Catholic theologian from Munich, became the first churchman imprisoned at Dachau.Berben, Paul (1975). Dachau, 1933–1945: the official history. Norfolk Press. ; p.143-145 From December 1940, Berlin ordered the transfer of clerical prisoners held at other camps, and Dachau became the centre for imprisonment of clergymen. Of a total of 2,720 clerics recorded as imprisoned at Dachau some 2,579 (or 94.88%) were Roman Catholics. Kershaw noted that some 400 German priests were sent to Dachau. Among the Catholic clergy who died at Dachau were many of the 108 Polish Martyrs of World War II. The Blessed Gerhard Hirschfelder died of hunger and illness in 1942. The Blessed Titus Brandsma, a Dutch Carmelite, died of a lethal injection in 1942. Blessed Alojs Andritzki, a German priest, was given a lethal injection in 1943. Blessed Engelmar Unzeitig, a Czech priest died of typhoid in 1945. Blessed Giuseppe Girotti died at the camp in April 1945. Amid the Nazi persecution of the Tirolian Catholics, the Blessed Otto Neururer, a parish priest was sent to Dachau for \\"slander to the detriment of German marriage\\", after he advised a girl against marrying the friend of a senior Nazi. He was cruelly executed at Buchenwald in 1940 for conducting a baptism there. He was the first priest killed in the concentration camps. The Blessed Bernhard Lichtenberg died en route to Dachau in 1943. In December 1944, the Blessed Karl Leisner, a deacon from Munster who was dying of tuberculosis received his ordination at Dachau. His fellow prisoner Gabriel Piguet, the Bishop of Clermont-Ferrand presided at the secret ceremony. Leisner died soon after the liberation of the camp. See main article for detailed information. Annexed regions The Nazi Gauleiter of Vienna, Odilo Globocnik. who launched a crusade against the Church = Austria = Austria, annexed by Germany in early 1938, was overwhelmingly Catholic.William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; pp. 349–350. At the direction of Cardinal Innitzer, the churches of Vienna pealed their bells and flew swastikas for Hitler's arrival in the city on 14 March.Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W.W. Norton & Co; London; p. 413 However, wrote Mark Mazower, such gestures of accommodation were \\"not enough to assuage the Austrian Nazi radicals, foremost among them the young Gauleiter Globocnik\\".Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire - Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; pp. 51–52 Globocnik launched a crusade against the Church, and the Nazis confiscated property, closed Catholic organisations and sent many priests to Dachau. The martyred Austrian priests Jakob Gapp and Otto Neururer were beatified in 1996. Neururer was tortured and hanged at Buchenwald and Jakob Gapp was guillotined in Berlin. Anger at the treatment of the Church in Austria grew quickly and October 1938, wrote Mazower, saw the \\"very first act of overt mass resistance to the new regime\\", when a rally of thousands left Mass in Vienna chanting \\"Christ is our Fuehrer\\", before being dispersed by police.Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire - Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; p.52 A Nazi mob ransacked Cardinal Innitzer's residence, after he had denounced Nazi persecution of the Church. L'Osservatore Romano reported on 15 October that Hitler Youth and the SA had gathered at Innitzer's Cathedral during a service for Catholic Youth and started \\"counter-shouts and whistlings: 'Down with Innitzer!

The operation, developed by the UNPROFOR staff in charge of the UNPA Western Slavonia (Sector West) in 1992, was scheduled to be implemented by two mechanised companies of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI) battalion deployed in the area. Although no HV attack occurred in the area during the UNPROFOR mandate, elements of the plan were used by the 3rd Battalion of the PPCLI as the HV clashed with the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (ARSK) in the January 1993 Operation Maslenica. The 2nd Battalion of the PPCLI implemented the plan in March 1993 to demonstrate UNPROFOR resolve. The UNPROFOR Sector West deputy commander considered the plan impractical except for deterrence, due to security concerns. Background In November 1991 Croatia, Serbia and the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) agreed upon the Vance plan, designed to halt combat operations in the Croatian War of Independence and allow the negotiation of a political settlement. In addition to the ceasefire, the plan protected civilians in specific areas—designated as United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs)—and UN peacekeepers in Croatia. The ceasefire went into effect on 3 January 1992. Shortly after the Vance plan was accepted the European Community announced its decision to grant diplomatic recognition to Croatia on 15 January 1992, and the Serb- and JNA-held areas of Croatia were organised as the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK). Despite the Vance plan's requirement for the immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA stayed behind for seven to eight months. When its troops eventually pulled out, the JNA transferred their equipment to the RSK. Because of organisational problems and breaches of the ceasefire, the UNPROFOR did not begin to deploy until 8 March and took two months to fully assemble in the UNPAs. The UNPROFOR was tasked with demilitarising the UNPAs, maintaining the ceasefire, monitoring local police and creating conditions for the return of internally displaced persons and refugees. These comprised more than 300,000 Croats who were exiled from RSK-controlled territory and 20,000 Serbs who fled areas of western Slavonia captured by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) in Operations Swath-10, Papuk-91 and Hurricane-91 in late 1991. A portion of western Slavonia, encompassing an area approximately , was designated as the UNPA Western Slavonia (or Sector West) by the peace plan. Although unlike other UNPAs, the RSK controlled only about one-third of the area—in the south, centred on the town of Okučani—the RSK-held area included a section of the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway. Sector West was divided into four areas of responsibility (AORs). The western portion of the motorway section and its surroundings were assigned to a Jordanian battalion of the UNPROFOR (JORDBAT), and the area to the east (containing the rest of the motorway within the UNPA and the town of Okučani) was the AOR of a Nepalese battalion (NEPBAT). To the north of the JORDBAT and NEPBAT AORs, a Canadian battalion (CANBAT 1) AOR was established. The northernmost portion of Sector West became the AOR of an Argentine battalion (ARGBAT). Unlike the Canadians, who had at their disposal 83 armoured personnel carriers, the Jordanian and Nepalese troops were equipped with small arms only. Sector West was commanded by Argentine Brigadier General Carlos Maria Zabala, and most of the staff work was assigned to the Canadians. The UNPROFOR established two storage depots for Army of the RSK (ARSK) heavy weapons, near Pakrac and in Stara Gradiška, and the HV moved its heavy weapons away from Sector West. Although the storage facilities were guarded by the UNPROFOR, the RSK was allowed access to maintain the weapons. =Canadian order of battle= CANBAT 1 initially included elements from the 1st Battalion of the Royal 22nd Regiment, the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Canadian Regiment (RCR) and the 8th Canadian Hussars under Lieutenant Colonel Michel Jones. Although lead elements of the unit reached Croatia on 8 April, it took two weeks for all the CANBAT 1 troops to arrive. In September 1992, the CANBAT 1 troops were replaced by the 3rd Battalion of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI). CANBAT 1 was headquartered in Polom Barracks, between the towns of Pakrac and Daruvar. Plan Map of the UNPROFOR-planned Operation Backstop on the map of the UNPA Western Slavonia (Sector West) The UNPROFOR operations staff in Sector West developed several defensive plans, assigning top priority to the plan codenamed Operation Backstop. It envisaged an active defence against the HV, assuming that the attack's main axis would be the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway. CANBAT 1 (supported by General Zabala) thought the HV would attack Sector West to control the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway, and the UN would not object to such a move. Any Croatian attack in the area was likely to employ substantially larger forces than those earmarked for Operation Backstop. CANBAT 1 was expected to deploy one mechanised company each to the JORDBAT and the NEPBAT AORs to position themselves defensively. The forces would attempt to deter the HV from advancing, demonstrate its resolve to defend Sector West, engage the HV with antitank weapons and mortars, protect the Jordanian and Nepalese withdrawal and withdraw under the protection of CANBAT 1. The two companies required eight hours notice of the HV advance to reach their designated positions in time. Presumably, the ARSK would retrieve its heavy weapons from the UNPROFOR storage by force and resist the HV. =Reaction to Operation Maslenica= In January 1993, when the HV launched Operation Maslenica (which aimed to capture the Maslenica Bridge), Canadian troops acted in accordance with part of Operation Backstop. They dug in their positions, reinforcing the Nepalese troops for 72 hours and expecting an HV attack in Sector West. No reinforcements were deployed to the JORDBAT AOR, and the UNPROFOR prepared to blow up the only bridge across the Sava River (linking Sector West and Bosnian Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina) to prevent the Army of Republika Srpska from advancing into the area. In response to Operation Maslenica, RSK president Goran Hadžić ordered the ARSK to retrieve its tanks from UN storage in Sector West and attack Nova Gradiška and Novska. When local RSK authorities (led by Veljko Džakula in Sector West) demanded an explanation of the order from Hadžić, he said that the Croatian forces were about to attack Okučani. On 26 January Zabala met with Džakula in Okučani and reassured him that the UNPROFOR would protect Sector West from a Croatian attack, agreeing to provide the RSK with a written guarantee to that effect. Although Hadžić accepted the assurance and cancelled the attack, the orders were reinstated and cancelled three more times over the next two days. On 7 February, Canadian troops drilled the deck of the bridge spanning the Strug Channel (north of Stara Gradiška) to place demolition charges. The move was protested by RSK authorities, who saw the route (the only link between Okučani and Serb-controlled territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina) as crucial to an evacuation in the event of an anticipated Croatian attack. The situation calmed down by mid-February, and the HV did not attack Sector West. =Exercise= The 2nd Battalion of the PPCLI replaced the 3rd Battalion in April as CANBAT 1. The commander of the 2nd Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Jim Calvin, instructed his troops to approach their tasks differently than the 3rd Battalion had. Calvin (unlike his predecessor) did not want the RSK forces or the HV to be aware of CANBAT 1 operations, ordering the battalion to observe radio silence. According to Canadian journalist Carol Off, Calvin was eager to fight and instructed his troops to return fire if necessary. The situation in Sector West deteriorated when Jordanian General Shabshough replaced Zabala in March. A major contribution to the deterioration was Shabshough's minimal involvement with local authorities, in contrast to Zabala's cooperative approach. To reassure the Sector West Croatian Serb population, CANBAT 1 performed an Operation Backstop exercise and the tasks needed to evacuate NEPBAT in March or April 1993. Afterwards, Canadian Sector West deputy commander Colonel K. C. Hague recommended that the plan be redesigned primarily as a means of deterrence. Hague felt that if Operation Backstop triggered an armed clash with the HV the UNPROFOR would be forced to withdraw through Croatia, exposing the peacekeepers to grave danger. Aftermath According to Croatian political scientist Vladimir Filipović, it is unclear whether the limited resources earmarked for the operation and the unclear motivation of CANBAT 1 troops would stop several HV brigades; according to Hague, the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 or the other elements of the UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia after such a clash. Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop, because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs, or beyond -wide zones around the UNPAs (where only United Nations Military Observers were present). However, Hague considered Operation Backstop a deterrent. Although Operation Backstop was within the UNPROFOR mandate (since the peacekeepers were authorised to use force to prevent armed incursions into the UNPAs), Croatian authorities resented the operation. Croatia considered the UNPROFOR overzealous in defending the UNPAs and protecting the Serbs while failing to ensure the fulfilment of other aspects of the Vance plan, such as the return of refugees to their homes. By September 1993, CANBAT 1 was relocated from Sector West to Sector South (northern Dalmatia and Lika). The UNPFROFOR mandate in Croatia expired on 31 March 1995, and the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 981 establishing the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO) instead. Sector West was captured by the HV in Operation Flash in early May 1995, with no resistance from UN peacekeepers. The main axis of the first day's HV advance was the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway, as anticipated by the planners of Operation Backstop.

Ashton was shot dead by striking workers in Manchester as a warning to their employers. The attack occurred in the midst of the rising tensions of the Victorian era due to the Industrial revolution and the subsequent emergence of the Chartist and trade- union movements to combat the extreme poverty of major industrial cities such as Manchester at the time. The assassination is widely considered to have inspired Elizabeth Gaskell's first novel, Mary Barton. Assassination and trial Three men were implicated in the crime - James Garside, Joseph Mosley and William Mosley. The judge and jury decided that Garside had pulled the trigger, despite it being his information which had originally led to the arrests; it was ruled that he had been hoping to blame his accomplices. William Mosley's account of the murder ran as follows: 'A short space afterwards there came a man down the footpath towards the clap gate. The man was in the footpath leading from Mr. Ashton's. Garside got up, and met him in the field before he got through the gate, and pointed the piece at him. He gave way. Garside fired. When Mr. Ashton gave way he only went a little out of the way. Garside met him, and he went back. He had got through the clap gate when he fired, and was going along the road to the mill. The man who was shot fell across the road, with his head towards the right hand side, opposite to where I was. We immediately ran away, and I made the best of my way across the fields to the second canal bridge.' Background As a centre of capitalism, Manchester was frequently the scene of labour riots and calls for greater political recognition by the city's working and non-titled classes - resulting in events such as the Peterloo Massacre of August 1819. The year prior to Ashon's death also saw major uprisings and rebellions against the bourgeoisie in the July Revolution of France, which stimulated radical and Chartist progression in England. William Mosley recounted that when he asked Garside which of the Ashtons he had shot, the response was 'it didn't matter which it was; it was one of them.'

The system was first noted as a shallow depression on February 23, while it was located to the north of Suva, Fiji. The system subsequently developed further as it moved westwards and was named as Tropical Cyclone Oscar during the next day. Over the next few days Oscar subsequently intensified as it moved westwards and gradually developed further and equivalent to a Category 3 Severe Tropical Cyclone, on the modern day Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale during February 27. The system subsequently turned and started to move south-eastwards towards Fiji. Meteorological history On February 23, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) started to monitor a shallow depression, that had developed about to the north-northwest of Suva, Fiji. The system subsequently developed further as it moved westwards and was declared a tropical cyclone and named Oscar by the FMS during February 24. Over the next few days Oscar subsequently intensified as it moved westwards and gradually developed further. During February 27, Oscar became equivalent to a Category 3 Severe Tropical Cyclone, on the modern day Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale as it started to move towards the south-east and Fiji. The system subsequently continued to intensify during that day with the eye appearing on satellite imagery, before it came into the range of the Nadi International Airport's radar at around 03:30 UTC (15:30 FST) on February 28. The radar imagery showed that the system had an eye within a better defined and larger concentric eye and allowed the FMS to perform hourly fixes on the systems position. Later that day at 12:00 UTC (00:00 FST, March 1), the FMS reported that the system had peaked with estimated 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 185 km/h (115 mph) which made it a Category 4 Severe Tropical Cyclone, . The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center subsequently reported six hours later that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 185 km/h (115 mph), which made it equivalent to a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Early on March 1, as Oscar passed about to the west-southwest of Nadi, it was decided to secure Nadi's radar dish and the satellite antennae as storm-force winds outside gusted to . During that day the system started to weaken while sustained winds of between were observed on Viti Levu, with a maximum wind gust of recorded at Nadi Airport. After wind gusts dropped and the pressure rose at Nadi, the radar was able to be brought back into operation at around 12:00 UTC (00:00 FST, March 2). The radar's poor image suggested that Oscar was now located to the south of Sigatoka, having accelerated from while the radar was shut down. Later that day the system wobbled towards the south-southeast, as it approached the island of Beqa, which spared the Fijian Capital of Suva from Oscar's worst effects. The system subsequently made landfall on the island of Kandavu at around 22:00 UTC (10:00 FST, March 2), before it left the Fijian group of islands during March 2. The system subsequently rapidly weakened before it was last noted during March 6, while it was located about to the south-east of Suva, Fiji. Preparations and impact Severe Tropical Cyclone Oscar affected Fiji between February 28 and March 2, and was responsible for nine deaths and in damages. As a result of the impact caused the name Oscar was retired, from the list of tropical cyclone names for the region. Ahead of a tropical cyclone alert for Fiji being issued during February 27, local radio bulletins made Fijians, aware that a tropical cyclone existed several days in advance. Gale, storm and hurricane warnings were subsequently issued for various parts of Fiji including Viti Levu, Kandavu and the Yasawa and Mamanutha island groups. Ahead of the system impacting the island nation, the Nadi International Airport was closed, with both internal and external flights cancelled. Schools around the nation were also closed with some being used as evacuation centres for the hundreds of Fijians who evacuated. During February 28, the system started to affect Fiji with strong winds and light rain, before the wind and rain gradually became stronger during March 1, with storm and hurricane-force winds recorded over the island nation. Damage was mostly in the form of severe flooding from storm tides and torrential rains. Hardest hit areas included the Mamanutha Group, western and southwestern Viti Levu, and Yanutha, Vatulele, Kandevu and Mbengga Islands. In some areas storm surges reached 9 to 12 feet. However, the highest measured storm surge value was 5.93 m (19.46 ft) at Rarawai Mill. Flooding due to torrential rains was particularly severe in western and southwestern Viti Levu. At Nadi Market flood levels were about 12 ft above the asphalt pavement. In the Singatoka Valley, which supplies most of Fiji's vegetables, most crops were destroyed as flooding reached levels beyond living memory of most people. Aftermath On March 1, after the system had moved through the archipelago, the Fijian Government immediately declared a national disaster and asked for assistance from the international community. Efforts to clean up certain towns including Nadi, Lautoka, Sigatoka and Suva started almost immediately after Oscar had moved away, with the Sigatoka Town council initiating a spraying campaign to destroy mosquitoes and counter an outbreak of disease.

Gray, D.L. Owen & K.T. Maunders, Corporate Social Reporting: Accounting and accountability (Hemel Hempstead: Prentice Hall, 1987)p. IX. Social Accounting is different from public interest accounting as well as from critical accounting. Social accounting is commonly used in the context of business, or corporate social responsibility (CSR), although any organisation, including NGOs, charities, and government agencies may engage in social accounting. Social Accounting can also be used in conjunction with community-based monitoring (CBM). Social accounting emphasises the notion of corporate accountability. D. Crowther defines social accounting in this sense as \\"an approach to reporting a firm’s activities which stresses the need for the identification of socially relevant behaviour, the determination of those to whom the company is accountable for its social performance and the development of appropriate measures and reporting techniques.\\"D. Crowther, Social and Environmental Accounting (London: Financial Times Prentice Hall, 2000), p. 20. It is an important step in helping companies independently develop CSR programs which are shown to be much more effective than government mandated CSR. Social accounting is a broad field that can be divided into narrower fields. Environmental accounting may account for an organisation's impact on the natural environment. Sustainability accounting is the quantitative analysis of social and economic sustainability. National accounting uses economics as a method of analysis. The International Standards Organization (ISO) provides a standard, ISO 26000, that is a resource for social accounting. It addresses the seven core areas to be assessed for social responsibility accounting. ISO 26000 Social Responsibility Guidance. (2010). (I. T. T. M. Board Ed. 1 ed.). Purpose Social accounting challenges conventional accounting, in particular financial accounting, for giving a narrow image of the interaction between society and organizations, and thus artificially constraining the subject of accounting. Social accounting, a largely normative concept, seeks to broaden the scope of accounting in the sense that it should: * concern itself with more than only economic events; * not be exclusively expressed in financial terms; * be accountable to a broader group of stakeholders; * broaden its purpose beyond reporting financial success. It points to the fact that companies influence their external environment ( some times positively and many times negatively) through their actions and should, therefore, account for these effects as part of their standard accounting practices. Social accounting is in this sense closely related to the economic concept of externality. Social accounting offers an alternative account of significant economic entities. It has the \\"potential to expose the tension between pursuing economic profit and the pursuit of social and environmental objectives\\".Gray R.H., D.L. Owen & C. Adams (1996) Accounting and Accountability: Changes and Challenges in Corporate Social and Environmental Reporting (London: Prentice Hall), Ch 1 The purpose of social accounting can be approached from two different angles, namely for management control purposes or accountability purposes. =Accountability vs authority= Social accounting for accountability purposes is designed to support and facilitate the pursuit of society's objectives. These objectives can be manifold but can typically be described in terms of social and environmental desirability and sustainability. In order to make informed choices on these objectives, the flow of information in society in general, and in accounting in particular, needs to cater to democratic decision-making. In democratic systems, Gray argues, there must then be flows of information in which those controlling the resources provide accounts to society of their use of those resources: a system of corporate accountability.Gray et al. (1996), esp Ch 3. Society is seen to profit from implementing a social and environmental approach to accounting in a number of ways, e.g.: * Honoring stakeholders' rights of information; * Balancing corporate power with corporate responsibility; * Increasing transparency of corporate activity; * Identifying social and environmental costs of economic success. =Management control= Social accounting for the purpose of management control is designed to support and facilitate the achievement of an organization's own objectives. Because social accounting is concerned with substantial self-reporting on a systemic level, individual reports are often referred to as social audits. The first complete internal model for social accounting and audit, 1981, was designed for social enterprises to help plan and measure their social, environmental and financial progress towards achieving their planned objectives.Freer Spreckley, Social Audit Toolkit Organizations are seen to benefit from implementing social accounting practices in a number of ways, e.g.:See R.H. Gray, 'Current Developments and Trends in Social and Environmental Auditing, Reporting & Attestation', International Journal of Auditing 4(3) (2000): pp247-268Crowther, Social and Environmental Accounting, esp Ch 2. * Increased information for decision-making; * Enhanced image management and Public Relations; * Identification of social responsibilities; * Identification of market development opportunities; * Maintaining legitimacy. According to BITC the \\"process of reporting on responsible businesses performance to stakeholders\\" (i.e. social accounting) helps integrate such practices into business practices, as well as identifying future risks and opportunities.Corporate responsibility reporting - Business in the Community The management control view thus focuses on the individual organization. Critics of this approach point out that the benign nature of companies is assumed. Here, responsibility, and accountability, is largely left in the hands of the organization concerned.Gray, 'Current Developments', p. 17. Scope =Formal accountability= In social accounting the focus tends to be on larger organisations such as multinational corporations (MNCs), and their visible, external accounts rather than informally produced accounts or accounts for internal use. The need for formality in making MNCs accountability is given by the spatial, financial and cultural distance of these organisations to those who are affecting and affected by it. Social accounting also questions the reduction of all meaningful information to financial form. Financial data is seen as only one element of the accounting language.See M.R. Mathews,'Towards a Mega-Theory of Accounting' in: Gray and Guthrie, Social Accounting, Mega Accounting and Beyond: A Festschrift in Honour of MR Mathews (CSEAR Publishing, 2007). =Self-reporting and third party audits= In most countries, existing legislation only regulates a fraction of accounting for socially relevant corporate activity. In consequence, most available social, environmental and sustainability reports are produced voluntarily by organisations and in that sense often resemble financial statements. While companies' efforts in this regard are usually commended, there seems to be a tension between voluntary reporting and accountability, for companies are likely to produce reports favouring their interests. The re-arrangement of social and environmental data that companies already produce as part of their normal reporting practice into an independent social audit is called a silent or shadow account. An alternative phenomenon is the creation of external social audits by groups or individuals independent of the accountable organisation and typically without its encouragement. External social audits thus also attempt to blur the boundaries between organisations and society and to establish social accounting as a fluid two- way communication process. Companies are sought to be held accountable regardless of their approval. It is in this sense that external audits part with attempts to establish social accounting as an intrinsic feature of organisational behaviour. The reports of Social Audit Ltd in the 1970s on e.g. Tube Investments, Avon Rubber and Coalite and Chemical, laid the foundations for much of the later work on social audits. =Reporting areas= Unlike in financial accounting, the matter of interest is by definition less clear-cut in social accounting; this is due to an aspired all-encompassing approach to corporate activity. It is generally agreed that social accounting will cover an organisation's relationship with the natural environment, its employees, and ethical issues concentrating upon consumers and products, as well as local and international communities. Other issues include corporate action on questions of ethnicity and gender.Gray et al., Accountability, Ch 1. =Audience= Social accounting supersedes the traditional audit audience, which is mainly composed of a company's shareholders and the financial community, by providing information to all of the organisation's stakeholders. A stakeholder of an organisation is anyone who can influence or is influenced by the organisation. This often includes, but is not limited to, suppliers of inputs, employees and trade unions, consumers, members of local communities, society at large and governments.Crowther, Social and Environmental Accounting, p. 19. Different stakeholders have different rights of information. These rights can be stipulated by law, but also by non-legal codes, corporate values, mission statements and moral rights. The rights of information are thus determined by \\"society, the organisation and its stakeholders\\". Some Social Accountability Tools * Social Audit * Public Audit * Public Hearing * Citizen Score Card (CSC) * Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) * Use of Citizen Charter * Use of Complaint Box Environmental accounting Environmental accounting, which is a subset of social accounting, focuses on the cost structure and environmental performance of a company. It principally describes the preparation, presentation, and communication of information related to an organisation’s interaction with the natural environment. Although environmental accounting is most commonly undertaken as voluntary self-reporting by companies, third-party reports by government agencies, NGOs and other bodies posit to pressure for environmental accountability. Accounting for impacts on the environment may occur within a company’s financial statements, relating to liabilities, commitments and contingencies for the remediation of contaminated lands or other financial concerns arising from pollution. Such reporting essentially expresses financial issues arising from environmental legislation. More typically, environmental accounting describes the reporting of quantitative and detailed environmental data within the non-financial sections of the annual report or in separate (including online) environmental reports. Such reports may account for pollution emissions, resources used, or wildlife habitat damaged or re- established. In their reports, large companies commonly place primary emphasis on eco-efficiency, referring to the reduction of resource and energy use and waste production per unit of product or service. A complete picture which accounts for all inputs, outputs and wastes of the organisation, must not necessarily emerge. Whilst companies can often demonstrate great success in eco-efficiency, their ecological footprint, that is an estimate of total environmental impact, may move independently following changes in output. Legislation for compulsory environmental reporting exists in some form e.g. in Denmark, Netherlands, Australia, the UK and Korea. In June 2012, the UK coalition government announced the introduction of mandatory carbon reporting, requiring all UK companies listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange - around 1,100 of the UK’s largest listed companies - to report their greenhouse gas emissions every year. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg confirmed that emission reporting rules would come into effect from April 2013 in his piece for The Guardian.Guide to UK Mandatory Carbon Reporting. http://ecometrica.com/products/our-impacts/mandatory-carbon-reporting/ However, the date was eventually moved back to 1 October 2013. The United Nations has been highly involved in the adoption of environmental accounting practices, most notably in the United Nations Division for Sustainable Development publication \\"Environmental Management Accounting Procedures and Principles\\". Environmental Management Accounting Procedures and Principles (2002) Applications Social accounting is a widespread practice in a number of large organisations in the United Kingdom. Royal Dutch Shell, BP, British Telecom, The Co-operative Bank, The Body Shop, and United Utilities all publish independently audited social and sustainability accounts.Shell Sustainability Report 2007: http://www.shell.com/static/responsible_energy/downloads/sustainability_reports/shell_sustainability_report_2007.pdf BP Sustainability Reports: http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=6914&contentId;=7042803 BT Society & Environment Report: http://www.btplc.com/Societyandenvironment/Socialandenvironmentreport/index.aspx The Co-operative Bank Sustainability Reporting: http://www.co- operativebank.co.uk/servlet/Satellite?c=Page&cid;=1168506355583&pagename;=Corp/Page/tplCorp The Body Shop Values Report 2007: http://valuesreport.thebodyshop.net/index.asp?lvl1=0&lvl2;=0&lvl3;=0&lvl4;=0 United Utilities Sustainable Development: http://www.unitedutilities.com/?OBH=5349 In many instances the reports are produced in (partial or full) compliance with the sustainability reporting guidelines set by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and indexes including EthicalQuote (CEQ) (reputation tracking of the world’s largest companies on Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG), Corporate Social Responsibility, ethics and sustainability). Traidcraft plc, the fair trade organisation, claims to be the first public limited company to publish audited social accounts in the UK, starting in 1993.See C. Dey, 'Social accounting at Traidcraft plc: A struggle for the meaning of fair trade', Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal 20(3) (2007): pp.423 - 445. The website of the Centre for Social and Environmental Accounting Research contains a collection of exemplary reporting practices and social audits. =Areas = Companies and other organisations (such as NGOs) may publish annual corporate responsibility reports, in print or online. The reporting format can also include summary or overview documents for certain stakeholders, a corporate responsibility or sustainability section on its corporate website, or integrate social accounting into its annual report and accounts. Companies may seek to adopt a social accounting format that is audience specific and appropriate. For example, H&M;, asks stakeholders how they would like to receive reports on its website; Vodafone publishes separate reports for 11 of its operating companies as well as publishing an internal report in 2005; Weyerhaeuser produced a tabloid-size, four-page mini-report in addition to its full sustainability report.Ethical Corporation: Report Reviews - Reporting review of the year – Corporate responsibility reporting – The best of times, the worst of times History Modern forms of social accounting first produced widespread interest in the 1970s. Its concepts received serious consideration from professional and academic accounting bodies, e.g. the Accounting Standards Board's predecessor, the American Accounting Association and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.See Accounting Standards Committee, The Corporate Report (London: ICAEW, 1975.)American Accounting Association, 'Report of the Committee on Human Resource Accounting', The Accounting Review Supplement to Vol. XLVIII.American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, The Measurement of Corporate Social Performance (New York: AICPA, 1977). Business-representative bodies, e.g. the Confederation of British Industry, likewise approached the issue.Confederation of British Industry. The Responsibility of the British Public Company (London: CBI, 1971). In 1981 Freer Spreckley produced a short book entitled Social Audit - A Management Tool for Co-operative WorkingFreer Spreckley, Social Audit - A Management Tool for Co-operative Working. designed as an internal organisational social accounting and audit model specifically for social enterprises who wished to measure their social, environmental and financial performance. This was the basis for the Co-operative Bank and Shell Corporation's social performance reports in the UK and subsequently many other private sector companies social responsibility reporting. Abt Associates, the American consultancy firm, is one of the most cited early examples of businesses that experimented with social accounting. In the 1970s Abt Associates conducted a series of social audits incorporated into its annual reports. The social concerns addressed included \\"productivity, contribution to knowledge, employment security, fairness of employment opportunities, health, education and self-development, physical security, transportation, recreation, and environment\\".Abt Associates Annual Report and Social Audit 1974, quoted in D. Blake, W. Frederick, M. Myers, Social Auditing, (New York: Praeger Publishers, 1976), p.149.

From 1937 until 1948 she appeared in motion pictures with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film Studios, including a small uncredited part in Gone with the Wind, from 1956 she took a second career becoming a dance teacher. Her younger sister was film and television actress Dorothy Morris. Early life Marsh was born in Hollywood, California. Her father was a Hollywood stockbroker. She and her family were active in the Methodist church. In 1937, she graduated from Hollywood High School and wanted to become an actress. Her parents did not approve of this choice and preferred she pursue a college education. They compromised by telling Caren that unless she could land an acting job she would be sent to school. Film career Marsh auditioned for a role in Rosalie (1937), starring Nelson Eddy and Eleanor Powell, but did not win the role. She later re-auditioned for that movie and got the part. She was hired as Judy Garland's dance stand-in for The Wizard of Oz. She was hired largely mostly because she was similar in height and build to Garland and even received her own pair of ruby slippers. She served as a stand-in for Garland a second time with Ziegfeld Girl (1941). According to Marsh, when she wasn't filling in for Garland in The Wizard of Oz she would be across Hollywood at Selznick International Pictures working as an extra in Gone with the Wind (1939). In film, credited under the name Caren Marsh, she appeared in films such as That Night in Rio (1941 ), Hands Across the Border (1944), Wild Harvest (1947), Girl Crazy (1943), Best Foot Forward (1943), Seven Sweethearts (1942), and Night and Day (1946). She did appear in speaking parts in films as Secrets of a Sorority Girl (1945) and Navajo Kid (1945). In 1947, Marsh was named Miss Sky Lady of 1947 and began appearing in fewer films to focus on her new interest in dance. After appearing in an airshow as Miss Sky Lady, she took flight instruction classes, learned to fly and later dropped leaflets of her acting profile on various movie studios in Hollywood. She made an appearance on The Gabby Hayes Show in 1956, after which she became a dance instructor. 1949 plane crash survival On July 12, 1949, aged 30, Marsh was aboard Standard Air Lines Flight 897R, when the C-46E crashed. The flight had left Albuquerque, New Mexico at 4:43 am. While on approach to the Lockheed Air Terminal in Burbank, California at 7:40 am, the twin engine plane, flying too low, hooked a wingtip on a hill and crashed near Chatsworth, California, and Marsh was one of the 13 people who survived. Marsh was pulled from the wreckage by another passenger named Judy Frost. Marsh was hospitalized at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital for several weeks, and nearly had her left foot amputated. Marsh's doctors told her that she would likely never dance again, but after careful exercise she was able to heal and continue in her dancing. The Wizard of Oz Although not a credited cast member, Marsh is one of a few known surviving personnel to have worked on the MGM film The Wizard of Oz. She has appeared in Wizard of Oz film festivals, conventions, and reunions. Personal life Marsh moved to Palm Springs, California, in 1957 and married Bill Doll, (died 1979) a press agent to theatre and film producer Mike Todd. The Dolls had one son. Her sister actress Dorothy Morris, became her neighbor when Marsh retired in 1971. The sisters lived next door to each other until Dorothy's death on November 20, 2011. Autobiography and 'Oz' festivals In November 2007, Marsh published her autobiography, Hollywood's Babe, in which she discussed her life in Hollywood, and her love affair with \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". In 2011, Marsh served as the Grand Marshal of the Oz-Stravaganza Parade in Chittenango, New York. Dance instructor Once a month on the first Monday, Marsh volunteers as a dance therapy instructor at the Palm Springs Stroke Activity Center where the styles taught range from themes like ballroom dancing, country, Hawaiian, and belly dancing.

DOVE allows creation of network virtualization layers for deploying, controlling, and managing multiple independent and isolated network applications over a shared physical network infrastructure.  Overview  The tunneling format is decoupled from the logical network view offered by DOVE, and defines only the way frames are encapsulated to be transferred by the underlying network infrastructure. As a notable difference from other network virtualization solutions (such as OTV), this allows DOVE not to be limited to providing OSI layer 2 emulation only (for example, passing Ethernet frames). Logical components of the DOVE architecture are DOVE controllers and DOVE switches (abbreviated as dSwitch). DOVE controllers perform management functions, and one part of the control plane functions across DOVE switches. DOVE switches perform the encapsulation of layer 2 frames into UDP packets using the Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) frame format, and provide virtual interfaces for virtual machines to plug into, similarly to how physical Ethernet switches provide ports for network interface controller (NIC) connections. DOVE switches are running as part of virtual machine hypervisors. = Advantages = Primary advantages of DOVE include the following: * No dependency on the underlying physical network and protocols * Use of the existing IP network infrastructure * No addresses of virtual machines are present in Ethernet switches, resulting in smaller MAC tables and less complex STP layouts * No limitations related to the Virtual LAN (VLAN) technology, resulting in more than 16 million possible separate networks, compared to the VLAN's limit of 4,000 * No dependency on the IP multicast traffic  Implementations  , DOVE components are implemented as part of VMware's hypervisors, while implementations for the Linux KVM and Open vSwitch are planned. DOVE extensions for VXLAN were merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 3.8, which was released on February 18, 2013. Appropriate extensions to related userspace configuration utilities were added into version 3.8.0 of the iproute2 utilities, which was released on February 21, 2013.

Biography Reade was of an ancient family, originally of Morpeth, in Northumberland. He was born about 1616 the was the fourth son of John Reade (and grandson of Sir Thomas Reade, of Barton, in Berkshire), and of Mary daughter and co-heir of Sir John Brocket, of Brocket Hall. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 7 June 1632. John Reade of Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire, was knighted at Newmarket on 12 March 1642, and four days later created a baronet by Charles I on 16 March 1642. During the Interregnum Reade held two offices under the Commonwealth. He was appointed Commissioner for Hertfordshire in November 1650 and was Sheriff of Hertfordshire in the year 1655/1656. The creation of the baronetcy (as were all others after 4 January 1642) was disallowed by the Act to make void all Titles of Honours, Dignities, or Precedencies, given by the late King since the 4th January, 1642 on 4 February 1652, so the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell gave him a new patent 25 June 1657 (this was the first hereditary honour bestowed by the Protector). The Cromwellian dignity was however, disallowed after the Restoration in May 1660, but, on the other hand, the disallowance of the former Baronetcy of 1642 then ceased, and he obtained a pardon on 7 June 1660, for all offences during the Civil War and the Commonwealth. He was Sheriff of Hertfordshire for a second time in the year 1673/1674, and was also elected as such November 1671, November 1676, and November 1677, but did not take up the position.

He was one of the Four Lords of the Warring States. Lord Chunshen is a revered figure in his former fief, especially in Shanghai, which is often called Shencheng, or City of Shen, in his honour. In 2002, Shanghai rebuilt the Temple of Lord Chunshen at the Chunshen Village in Songjiang District. Family background Much of what is known about Lord Chunshen comes from his biography in the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji), written by the great Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian. The Shiji does not mention his family background, leading some historians to speculate that he descended from the State of Huang, judging by his surname. However, most modern historians, including Ch'ien Mu and Yang Kuan, believe that he was a son of King Huai of Chu, and younger brother of King Qingxiang of Chu. As ambassador to Qin As Huang Xie was a well-educated scholar and highly eloquent in his speech, King Qingxiang of Chu dispatched him as an ambassador to the Kingdom of Qin. At this time the Kingdom of Chu, though large in area, was in grave danger from Qin, the most powerful of the Seven Warring States. King Huai, King Qingxiang's father, had died in captivity in Qin, and a Qin army had invaded the western part of Chu and captured its capital Ying. King Qingxiang had been forced to flee and move his capital east to Chen County. The historical text Zhan Guo Ce records a long, impassioned letter written by an unnamed Chu envoy to the king of Qin, pleading him not to invade Chu. In the Shiji, Sima Qian attributes this letter to Huang Xie, saying that he successfully persuaded King Zhao of Qin to call off his plan to invade Chu. However, modern historians have concluded the letter could not have been written by Huang, as it mentioned events that occurred after his death. Rescue of the crown prince As part of a peace treaty with Qin, King Qingxiang of Chu agreed to send his son, Crown Prince Wan, to Qin as a hostage, and Huang Xie stayed with the prince in Qin. After several years, Huang Xie received the news that King Qingxiang was ill. Afraid that the son of Lord Yangwen, King Qingxiang's brother, would seize the throne if Crown Prince Wan remained a hostage in Qin, Huang Xie secretly arranged the prince's escape back to Chu. When Huang Xie told King Zhao of Qin about Prince Wan's escape, the furious king ordered him to commit suicide. However, Fan Ju, the Prime Minister of Qin, persuaded King Zhao to release Huang Xie, in order to maintain a friendly relationship with Chu. As Prime Minister of Chu Three months after Huang Xie returned to Chu, King Qingxiang died in 263 BC. Crown Prince Wan ascended the throne, to be known as King Kaolie of Chu. In 262 BC, King Kaolie appointed Huang Xie the Prime Minister of Chu, awarded him the title Lord Chunshen, and enfeoffed him with twelve counties of Huaibei, north of the Huai River. Fifteen years later, at Lord Chunshen's own request, the king changed his fief to the Jiangnan area (then called Jiangdong), because it was better for the state to directly administer the strategic Huaibei area, at the border with Qi. Lord Chunshen set up his new base at the former capital of Wu, in modern Suzhou. Lord Chunshen became powerful and wealthy, and kept more than 3,000 retainers. He became well known as one of the Four Lords of the Warring States, together with Lord Mengchang of Qi, Lord Xinling of Wei, and Lord Pingyuan of Zhao. In 259 BC, the Qin army massacred 400,000 Zhao soldiers at the Battle of Changping, and besieged Handan, the capital of Zhao, the following year. Zhao sought help from Chu; Lord Chunshen led the Chu army to Handan, and successfully relieved the siege. In 256 BC, Lord Chunshen attacked the State of Lu, and annexed the state for Chu. In 241 BC, five of the seven major warring states: Chu, Zhao, Wei, Yan, and Han, formed an alliance to fight the rising power of Qin. King Kaolie of Chu was named the leader of the alliance, and Lord Chunshen the military commander. According to historian Yang Kuan, the Zhao general Pang Nuan (庞煖) was the actual commander in the battle. The allies attacked Qin at the strategic Hangu Pass, but were defeated. King Kaolie blamed Lord Chunshen for the loss and began to mistrust him. Afterwards, Chu moved its capital east to Shouchun, farther away from the threat of Qin. Assassination In 238 BC, King Kaolie was ill. Earlier, Lord Chunshen's retainer Li Yuan (李園) presented his younger sister to the king. The sister gave birth to a son, who was made the crown prince of Chu, and she became the queen. Li Yuan also gained the favour of the king. When the king was dying, Zhu Ying (), another of Lord Chunshen's 3,000 retainers, advised him to kill Li Yuan, but Lord Chunshen refused, believing that Li Yuan was a weak man and grateful to him. As soon as King Kaolie died in 238 BC, Li Yuan dispatched killers to assassinate Lord Chunshen as he entered the Ji Gate () in Shouchun. After killing him, Li Yuan ordered the massacre of Lord Chunshen's entire family. Li Yuan's nephew, the crown prince, ascended the throne, to be known as King You of Chu. Relationship with King You According to the Zhan Guo Ce, King You of Chu was the illegitimate son of Lord Chunshen. It is said that King Kaolie had no son despite having many concubines. Li Yuan presented his younger sister to Lord Chunshen, and after she became pregnant with Lord Chunshen's child but before the pregnancy was obvious, Lord Chunshen presented the woman to the king. She gave birth to a boy named Xiong Han, who was made the crown prince and later became King You of Chu. Sima Qian recorded the story in the Shiji as part of Lord Chunshen's biography, but most historians, including Huang Shisan, Ch'ien Mu, and Yang Kuan, consider it apocryphal. King Kaolie was known to have at least three other sons, King Ai, Fuchu, and Lord Changping, the last three kings of Chu. Legacy Lord Chunshen is a revered figure in his former fief of Wu, and especially in Shanghai. He was credited with building hydrological works on the \\"three rivers\\" of Wu: East River, Lou River, and Wusong River, which helped to prevent floods and develop agriculture. The Huangpu, Shanghai's \\"mother river\\", gets its name from Lord Chunshen's surname Huang. The Huangpu is also called the Chunshen or Shen River. Shanghai is also called Shencheng, or City of Shen, in the honour of Lord Chunshen. In 2002, the Shanghai government rebuilt the Temple of Lord Chunshen on the site of an ancient temple. The temple is in the Chunshen Village, where he was said to have lived, in Songjiang District. The temple is decorated with calligraphy by famous Songjiang artists Shi Zhecun, Cheng Shifa, and Zheng Wei (). Lord Chunshen's tomb is said to be located in Huainan, Anhui province, 12 kilometers outside of ancient Shouchun. The extant tomb measures 90 meters by 80 meters, and is 11 meters high. Jiangxia District of Wuhan, Hubei province claims that Lord Chunshen was buried in Jiangxia after his death, and has built a tomb and sculpture for him.

According to the company, the founders wanted to build an acoustic guitar that paid homage to guitar tradition while incorporating improvements in structural design and cosmetics.https://www.acousticguitar.com/Gear/Reviews/Huss-and-Dalton- Crossroads-Review/ The company currently operates on a small scale, producing around 250 instruments per year in a two-story brick workshop.https://www.facebook.com/hussanddalton/info  Construction  Huss and Dalton use two distinct construction styles in building their guitars. Standard Series models feature a 25' radius on the guitar top. They achieve this by building an arch into the braces, and preparing the sides in the same radius to accept the soundboard. Traditional Series guitars feature the same 25' radius in the braces, but the sides are flat, in a more traditional construction style.http://www.acousticguitar.com/Community/Profiles/Huss- Dalton  Construction details  Huss and Dalton base most guitars in their catalog on historical Martin Guitar designs and some vintage Gibson Guitar models, though they incorporate key design changes:http://www.rockworldmagazine.com/huss-dalton-that-distinctive-ring-of- a-custom-guitar/ * Hand-split Appalachian red spruce braces, sourced from Mt.

Records indicate that Jefferson planted the tree outside his bedroom window, around 1807.http://www.monticello.org/site/house-and-gardens/tulip-poplar-tree The Thomas Jefferson Foundation contacted Huss & Dalton to determine if any remaining wood was suitable for one or more guitars. Although most of the tree was unusable, the pair found several boards of guitar-suitable wood. The company introduced a limited series of Monticello guitars whose proceeds they shared with the Thomas Jefferson Foundation.http://www.virginialiving.com/virginiana/history/regal-tree- historic-sound/ Musicians Two musicians who played Huss & Dalton guitars or banjos include the late George Shuffler and the late James Alan Shelton. Over the years, Huss and Dalton built two signature-series guitars based on the preferred specs of both of these monumental bluegrass guitarists, the former of whom is well known for developing the cross-picking style of guitar, the latter for expanding and continuing the tradition, in limited runs of 25 pieces each. In October 2014, a 26th James Alan Shelton model was raffled off at IBMA, the proceeds of which went to assist Shelton's widow, Greta Shelton. As of 2016, the company is building a series of guitars endorsed and designed by guitarist Albert Lee.

A prominent figure in the International Music scene since 1993, he is most recognized for his numerous theatrical compositions and productions, including musicals, international events, and dance theatre shows. Imre earned international acclaim for his 18-year collaboration with ExperiDance, a famous dance troupe whose shows premiered in top theaters across Europe and Asia. His international repertoire includes compositions for the 2008 Summer and 2014 Winter Olympic Games, and the 2013 European Judo Championship and the 2006 European Aquatic Championship Official Song. In 2008 and 2009 Imre was selected to compose music for the prestigious Hungarian National Day firework shows, each with a viewership of over 3 million people. Czomba has worked with world-famous star friends as Kenny G, Michael Boddicker, Alphonso Johnson (Weather Report, Santana), Ed Calle (Gloria Estefan, Michael Bolton), Richie Garcia (Phill Collins band), Michael O'Neill (musician) (Barbra Streisand band) etc. on his #QuarantineMusicChain project. Early life At an early point in his career, Imre was inspired by the blues, which can be clearly heard in his piano playing. He has been a member of several top blues bands and has performed on the same stages with B. B. King, Sting, Zucchero, Pink and Robben Ford. Imre has appeared on over 110 albums and as a composer, arranger, orchestrator, music producer, and musician. He has been the recipient of 18 Gold, 14 Platinum and 4 Double Platinum albums. In the pop music world, his most notable success was with the band Nox, who went on to win a number of local awards, including the Golden Giraffe. Quarantine Music Chain Czomba's friends joined from sixteen countries to this truly diverse and exciting musical trip. Stars from the US, Germany, Australia, Canada, Egypt, Norway, Slovakia, France, Germany, New Zealand, China, Russia, Israel, Norway, Argentina, and Hungary, and of course from Hollywood, appear in the production - composers, musicians and singers alike. The internationally acclaimed artist initially called only a few of his friends to see if they would like to take part in a joint song recorded from home, but his list was filled in moments with yeses from stars like Kenny G, Michael Boddicker, Alphonso Johnson (Weather Report, Santana), Ed Calle(Gloria Estefan, Michael Bolton), Richie Garcia (Phill Collins band), Sara Andon, Andrew Kesler (Accent), Michael O'Neill (musician) (Barbra Streisand band), etc. Czomba, in response to the constraints, conducted a joint jam session recorded from home with the help of more than 100 famous co-creators. However, the music was not composed by an artist alone, but it was born in a special way, as a result of the inspiring voices of more composers. Theatre In 2000 Imre's career took a different turn when he was asked to compose music for several successful plays such as Merlin Theatre's Deathtrap. That experience leads to a meeting with choreographer Sandor Roman with whom Imre developed the unique harmony of dance and music for ExperiDance. The dance group is committed to the heritage of Hungarian folk dance. Imre is successfully composing an outstanding music repertoire built around Hungarian folk music but also manages to step outside its boundaries. This new musical direction has turned into a romantic and grandiose part of world-music. These stage-shows are regularly played on the main stages of Budapest's top theaters, and in bigger cities countrywide as guest-performances. He has many successful musical plays, for example, Birth of a Country(2007). The shows were performed with 250 dancers and 10 singers at Budapest's most famous Hero Square. Untouchables(2012) played at the Margaret Island Open-Air Stage and The Taming of the Shrew (Makrancos Kata)(2013) played at the RaM Colosseum. Sporting Events Official Songs In 2006 Imre also got the opportunity to compose the official song of the 2006 European Aquatics Championships. Sports lovers all over the continent enjoyed the song and it went platinum on the day of its CD release. This led to Imre composing the Hungarian Olympic Team's official song in 2008, the Judo European Championship's official song in 2013 and Evgeni Plushenko's Russian National Championship and Winter Olympic Music.

Early life and career  Ira G. Rawn was born on August 20, 1855, in Delaware, Ohio, the son of Peter and Sarah Rawn. By 1870, at age 15, Ira Rawn was listed in the 1870 U.S. census as a telegraph operator. Rawn began his railway career with the Big Four Railroad in 1880 as a telegraph operator and was subsequently promoted to trainmaster. In 1887 he took the position of Master of Transportation for Kentucky Central Railroad. In 1889 he became the Division Superintendent and Superintendent of Transportation for Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, then became General Superintendent of Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's (B&O;) Southwestern division in 1890. In 1904 Rawn was appointed General Manager of the B&O.; He left the B&O; to become the Vice President of Operations for Illinois Central Railroad in 1907, then was elected president of the Monon Railroad in 1909. His term as president of the Monon began on November 1, 1909, and ended with his death on July 20, 1910. = Car repair contract scandal = The Illinois Central filed suit in Chicago Circuit Court on June 6, 1910, alleging that when it closed its own car repair shops in 1906, several executives of the railroad conspired to defraud it of large amounts of money through overcharging on repair contracts. Rawn's involvement was alleged to be the executive who approved the contracts while knowing that the contractors were deliberately overcharging. Other reports indicate that Rawn may have been bribed to approve the contracts.  Death and inquest  Rawn died from a gunshot on July 20, 1910, at his home in Winnetka, a suburb of Chicago. Reports at the time note that the injury may have been self-inflicted as legal proceedings had implicated Rawn as responsible for corrupt railway car repair contracts with the Illinois Central Railroad from which the railroad lost more than $1 million. He had been called to the witness stand several times in the weeks leading up to his death but had only answered a few questions and had been permitted to leave for various reasons several times. Although his family members claimed that the wound was incurred in self-defense from a burglar, investigating police at the scene disputed this assertion. Pinkertons also investigated into Rawn's death and found evidence to support the family's claim of self-defense. Reports surfaced that a second bullet was found in the fireplace ashes near his body, and on July 22, coroner Peter Hoffman announced that he had received a letter identifying a black man by name as the burglar but Hoffman would not divulge the name that was in the letter except to police investigating the case. But a subsequent inquest into his death ruled after lengthy deliberation on July 29 in favor of the opinion that Rawn was killed by a shot from his own weapon that was fired by his own hand. The inquest did not, however, affirm whether it was a suicide attempt or an accident; the jurors worded the verdict in such a way as not to jeopardize the family's claims on Rawn's life insurance policies, which were valued in excess of $100,000. A month after his death, there was an attempt to steal papers related to the scandal from the home of his daughter and son-in-law while they were out of town, but the theft was interrupted by a watchman. Ira Rawn was buried in Rosehill Cemetery on July 22, 1910.  Family details  Ira Rawn married Florence Willis on October 5, 1880, in Delaware, Ohio, and together they had three daughters: Sarah Elizabeth, Katherine (Coburn) and Florence. He was survived by his wife, Florence.  References   External links  * Photo of Ira G.

It was composed during his serial period. The piece is notable in that it shows Stravinsky's complete dedication to the serial idiom which was notably more tentative in previous serial based compositions and shows the distinct influence of Anton Webern on Stravinsky's own serial language.Orrin Howard, Movements, for Piano and Orchestra, by Igor Stravinsky. Los Angeles Philharmonic website (archive from 30 January 2018; accessed 22 April 2018).  Composition  Stravinsky composed the Movements on commission by a Swiss industrialist for his pianist wife Margrit Weber, for the sum of $15,000. Mrs. Weber premiered the work at a Stravinsky Festival in New York's Town Hall on January 10, 1960 with the composer himself conducting. Herr Weber had asked for a work of between 15 and 20 minutes but instead Stravinsky fulfilled the commission with a more refined and compressed piece lasting around half the length of the commission.  Analysis  Stravinsky breaks the orchestra down into smaller chamber-like sections with the piano acting as a pivot between the smaller contrasting sections of the orchestra creating subtle and gestural textures favored by Webern in pieces such as his Concerto for Nine Instruments (Op. 24) and the Variations for Orchestra (Op. 30) the latter of which Stravinsky admired greatly. Due to the highly constructed nature of the twelve tone idiom employed, all thematic material is drawn from a single tone row which is given by the solo piano in a very nonlinear gesture at the very opening of the work: E F B A A D C B C F G and F.http://www.allmusic.com/composition/movements-5-for-piano-amp-orchestra- mc0002361575 The row is really only presented in its complete form a couple of times; it is far more often broken up into smaller groups and manipulated into slightly varied orderings. The technique of Klangfarbenmelodie can thus clearly be heard particularly in the opening of the piece whose gestural phrase mimics that of Webern's Op. 24. Stravinsky himself described the harmonic structure of Movements as \\"anti-tonal\\". Traditional references to triadic harmonic structures are eliminated in favor of an almost total linear based idiom with conventional ostinati and harmonic considerations replaced with an atonal and highly contrapuntal texture characterized by gestures, inner unity and a strict adherence to serial forms far more pervasive than in previous serial compositions by Stravinsky. Orchestration: 2 flutes (2nd = piccolo), oboe, English horn, clarinet, bass clarinet, bassoon, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, harp, celesta, strings, and solo piano.

The band was formed in 1999 by Nick Alexander (vocals), Dominic James (guitar, keyboard), Nikki Clayton (bass) and Al Macdonald (drums). The original line-up lasted until 2002 following which a series of line-up changes occurred over a number of years. Al McDonald was replaced by James McMurrugh, shortly followed by Nikki Clayton being replaced by Alex Kenyon. Alex Kenyon and James McMurrugh both left in late 2003 and Steven Joseph (bass) joined the band soon after with the band now being accompanied by a drum machine. In 2005 the band became a four-piece again with the addition of Edd Crossman on the drums. This line-up lasted until 2009 when Edd Crossman was replaced by Zak Hayne. Zak Hayne left soon after and Dominic James decided to now play the drums instead of the guitar and Nick Alexander was also playing guitar in addition to singing. Latest members Johnny Dreamguns (guitar) joined in 2011 and Phil Meredith (guitar) joined in 2012. The band have released 3 EPs and 1 album. In their early years, the band was compared to the Dead Kennedys and Joy Division but they adopted their current more-psychedelic sound during the period 2006–2008.

It contains a single species, Siats meekerorum. S. meekerorum could be the first neovenatorid discovered in North America and the geologically youngest allosauroid yet discovered from the continent. It was initially classified as a megaraptoran, a clade of large theropods with very controversial relationships. This group may be examples of tyrannosauroids, neovenatorid allosauroids, or basal coelurosaurs. Discovery Dorsal vertebra Siats was first described and named by Lindsay E. Zanno and Peter J. Makovicky in 2013 and the type species is Siats meekerorum. The generic name is derived from the name of Siats, a man-eating monster in the Ute mythology. The specific name meekerorum honours the late geologist John Caldwell Meeker who bequeathed a fund for the support of paleontological research, his widow Withrow Meeker and their daughter Lis Meeker, one of the volunteers in the research project. Siats is known from the holotype FMNH PR 2716, a partial postcranial skeleton housed at the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago. FMNH PR 2716 consists of five dorsal and eight caudal vertebrae, a chevron, partial right ilium, ischium and fibula, a partial left tibia, and several right and left pedal phalanges. FMNH PR 2716 was discovered by Lindsay Zanno, as a part of a 2008 expedition of the Field Museum led by Peter Makovicky. It was collected between 2008 and 2010 from the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation, in Emery County of Utah, dating to the early Cenomanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, approximately 94.5 million years ago. Description Size compared to a human The holotype specimen, FMNH PR 2716, consists of material from a single individual that is considered skeletally immature on the basis of the incomplete fusion of neural arches to the centra of the dorsal vertebrae. Siats is characterized by seven diagnostic, including four autapomorphic (i.e. unique), traits. Its autapomorphies include the subtriangular cross section of the distal caudal vertebrae, elongated centrodiapophyseal laminae lacking noticeable infradiapophyseal fossae on the proximal caudals, a transversely concaved acetabular rim of iliac pubic peduncle, and the presence of a notch on the end of the truncated lateral brevis shelf. Other notable traits include the broad neural spines on the dorsal vertebrae. Life restoration Siats represents one of the largest known theropods from North America. Zanno and Mackovicky (2013), using other megaraptoran taxa as a proxy, estimated the length of the holotype individual at long, scaling upwards from the femur. Additionally, using a femur circumference regression, they estimated its mass at roughly 4 tons. The authors also wrote that the holotype specimen was already comparable in size to Saurophaganax and Acrocanthosaurus despite the visible neurocentral sutures showing absence of ossification, suggesting a skeletally immature individual. If it is a neovenatorid, the discovery of Siats also reveals that allosauroids did not yield dominance in North America to tyrannosauroids until the late Cretaceous. However, there has been and still is substantial disagreement on the classification of megaraptorans, which are usually found to be either neovenatorids or tyrannosauroids, often with both interpretations appearing in the same paper. The placement of Siats within Megaraptora itself has also been a source of controversy, with recent analyses placing it as a non-megaraptoran neovenatorid irrespective of the placement of Megaraptora. Phylogeny and classification Siats was initially classified as a megaraptoran neovenatorid closely related to Chilantaisaurus upon its discovery in 2013, based on the presence of pronounced centrodiapophyseal laminae bracketed by deep infradiapophyseal fossa on the caudal neural arches, similar to that of the megaraptoran Aerosteon. In a 2014 description of a juvenile Megaraptor specimen, the referral of Siats to Megaraptora was contested, and megaraptorans were found to more likely be tyrannosauroids rather than neovenatorids such as Siats. The paper noted that, although sharing various features with Neovenator, Siats was very different from megaraptorans in the structure of its dorsal vertebrae, ilium, and fibula. A subsequent analysis conducted by Coria and Currie (2016), which even placed megaraptorans as neovenatorids, still placed Siats and Chilantaisaurus as neovenatorids outside of Megaraptora. On the other hand, the phylogenetic study published by Bell et al. (2016) recovered Siats as a member of Coelurosauria of uncertain phylogenetic placement within this group; the analysis indicated that Siats might either be a relative of ornithomimosaurs, a theropod more closely related to maniraptorans than tyrannosauroids, a basal megaraptoran, or a tyrannosauroid more closely related to tyrannosaurids than Xiongguanlong.

It was nominated in several categories for the Martín Fierro Awards in 2004, 2005, and 2006, and won three times in 2005. Plot Gabriel Nielsen (Suar) and Oso (Antonio Grimau) have a private security company known as Nielsen Security. Axel (Cabré), the son of Oso, wants to join it but he is rejected. When Oso is murdered, Gabriel and Axel join forces to capture the criminal. In the second season, most employees resign, and policewoman Antonia López (Dupláa) joins the agency. Awards Sin código received two nominations for the 2004 Martín Fierro Awards, as best miniseries and best actor in a miniseries (Cabré). It did not win the award in either category. At the 2005 ceremony for the same awards, the program received several nominations. Rita Cortese, nominated alongside Griselda Siciliani, won the Martín Fierro for secondary actress in comedy; Siciliani won the Martín Fierro for new actress. Favio Posca, Nicolás Scarpino and Alfredo Casero were nominated as best secondary actors in a comedy series; Scarpino won the award. Other unsuccessful nominations were best comedy, lead actor in a comedy series (Suar) and lead actress in a comedy series (Dupláa). It received two nominations in 2006, for lead actress in a comedy series (Dupláa) and supporting actor in a comedy series (Scarpino), but did not win either award. In other media Sin código had a spin-off, the 2011 superhero live action television series Los únicos, in which Cabré reprised his role as Axel. In the first episodes Cabré had telephone discussions with Gabriel Nielsen; Suar (who is also the head of Pol-Ka, the producers of the program) reprised his character in April. Siciliani worked on Los únicos as well, but with a new character. She made a cameo with her former character, while still working with her current one. Suar had plans to make a film out of the series. The first testings would be made in January 2006, and the filming would begin on February. However, when he returned from his vacation in January, he cancelled the project. This angered Cabré and Dupláa, who had rejected other plans for that year to take part in the film. Dupláa stayed for some months in Spain with her husband, and Cabré moved to rival channel Telefe. Suar temporarily gave up acting and focused on his work as producer.

The island of Endelave in Denmark. Beach Meadows are coastal meadows influenced by the presence of the nearby sea. Under this definition, the salinity of the air and wind is usually high and the meadows are often flooded during and after stormy weather. These conditions implies that the flora is dominated by salt-tolerant species. But that alone does not make a meadow. To be categorized as a meadow in the first place, the plantgrowth has to be low in height, and normally this can only be achieved from wear by general traffic or grazing of the landscape, either artificially or by livestock. Beach meadows are therefore usually thought of as cultural landscapes or biotopes, requiring some degree of intervention and not being able to sustain itself on its own. If left to their own, beach meadows would usually transform into a so-called transitional meadow and eventually a shrubby or bushy seashore habitat.  Flora and fauna  Beach meadows are fundamentally an unstable nature type and this condition have an important influence on the flora and fauna found here. Beach meadows are characterized by a number of plants and animals that could not have thrived if the habitat was left to a natural development. The grazing (or traffic) hinders bushes, trees and shrubs to get the upper hand and allows low-growth plants to emerge and dominate. This again attracts and supports a special fauna that would change character, if the beach meadow were left to its own. The specific flora and fauna is of course determined by the general climate and geography of the beach meadow. = Birds = Beach meadows offers a variety of opportunities to many birds, primarily waders, ducks and gulls. Many species are resting here during tides and they are feeding in the small ponds. A number of bird species use beach meadows as breeding grounds, especially on islands without predators like fox, mustelidae (raccoon dogs, wolverines, polecats, etc.) or the like. Introducing even small numbers of predators to beach meadow habitats, can wreak havoc on the bird populations, as predators have unrestricted access to eggs and birds.  Beach meadow localities  Denmark has several beach meadows. Large and well-developed meadows can primarily be found in the Wadden Sea, Limfjord and Isefjord areas and on the islands of Læsø and Lolland, but there are many other smaller beach meadows throughout this lowlying country. On the Faroese Islands and in Greenland 'fell meadows' can be found. They are usually not flooded by seawater, so it could be argued if they are truly beach meadows. Iceland, Norway and some parts of Sweden, has extensive 'fell meadows'. In the Baltic region, there are several beach meadows. Sweden can present true beach meadows on Öland and in some parts of Gotland fx. and Estonia has large beach meadows of international importance to migratory birds. United Kingdom has several beach meadows throughout. They can be found in Cornwall and the country of Wales has several. Here the coast often consists of high cliffs, so the meadows are usually not flooded by seawater and strictly speaking they would be classified as 'coastal meadows' or 'fell meadows'. Examples can be found on the Llŷn Peninsula, where cattle are grazing. Scotland has many fell meadows. Ireland has large areas of fell meadows with grazing cattle. On the American continent, Canada can present extensive fell meadows on Nova Scotia. As the practices of cattle grazing is diminishing in many places - especially the industrialized parts -, the stress of overgrowth are endangering them as meadow habitats.

The company was launched in London in 2007 by Australian co-founders Alicia Navarro and Joe Stepniewski. It has over 62 employees, and has raised $24 million in funding as of August 2013. It has offices in London and New York City. On October 17, 2013, Skimlinks was announced as a member of Tech City UK's Future Fifty Programme, a government programme that supports fast-growing companies with the aim of potentially floating in the London Stock Exchange. In 2014, Skimlinks drove $625 million in sales for over 20,000 vendors. In 2019, Skimlinks drove $1.1B in sales for over 48,500 vendors.  History  = Founding = Skimlinks was founded in 2007 by co-founders Alicia Navarro and Joe Stepniewski as a result of a pivot away from the social recommendation tool Skimbit.com. It is notable as one of the first technology companies headquartered in what is now known as the Silicon Roundabout area in London. Alicia Navarro created Skimbit.com in 2006 in Australia, but moved to London to build her business as she felt it was a much more supportive environment for entrepreneurs. Skimbit was relatively successful and quickly evolved into a white-label social shopping service. In November 2008, Joe Stepniewski was brought on as co-founder, and together they realised that both users and investors weren't interested in their end- product, but in the behind-the-scenes technology they were using to monetise their site through affiliate marketing. As a result, they pivoted the company into what it is today - a \\"stand-alone commercial platform to help publishers monetize their editorial and user-generated content.\\" Alicia Navarro has been featured in a number of prominent publications, highlighting her role as one of the few female CEOs in the ad-tech world. She was also recently announced as the winner of the Entrepreneur of the Year Award during the 2014 edition of the FDM everywoman in Technology Awards. = Partnership with Pinterest = In February 2012, LL Social, an online marketing blog, broke the news that Pinterest was using Skimlinks to monetise content posted by its users. Commercial links included in Pins were being affiliated via Skimlinks. Although the partnership had been ongoing for 2 years, Pinterest had just recently grown exponentially in popularity and the news was badly received. Most of the backlash centered on the company's failure to disclose its monetisation practices rather than its decision to monetise users' content. Though it was claimed that the revelations prompted Pinterest to drop its affiliation with Skimlinks, Pinterest's CEO, Ben Silbermann, clarified that they had actually been using Skimlinks as a test while they explored various monetisation solutions and had stopped using the service a week before the news broke. = Investors = Funds have been raised from investors including The Accelerator Group, Sussex Place Ventures, NESTA, Venrex, BDMI and Greycroft, with advisory board members such as Gokul Rajaram (formerly Head of Product for Google Adsense and Facebook Ads) and Oren Michels (CEO of Mashery). In early 2015, Skimlinks' brought investors from Frog Capital on board as part of their Series C funding round, bringing their total funds raised to $24 million. = Acquisitions = Skimlinks acquired New York–based competitor, Atma Links, in 2011 to power its SkimWords technology. It then acquired InvisibleHand - a significant player in real-time e-commerce and product pricing - in 2013.  Products  Through relationships with various affiliate networks like Commission Junction, Pepperjam, and Linkshare, Skimlinks aggregates over 24,000 merchant programs which are available to publishers who join the service. To use Skimlinks, prospective users need to apply. Once approved, publishers receive a custom JavaScript snippet to be installed in the footer of their site(s). Users can also install Skimlinks using a WordPress plugin. The snippet will then automatically affiliate applicable URLs in their content. By using Skimlinks, publishers can earn money via commissions on sales, from product links and references in their content to merchants in the Skimlinks network. In 2019, Skimlinks was the first to go-to-market with an AMP integration for affiliate monetization. Skimlinks is used by 1.5 million domains globally by online publishers like BuzzFeed, Condé Nast, Hearst Digital, WordPress, Time Inc., and Mail Online. The company has released a variety of tools to which users have access in order to monetise their content. The main ones (as shown on the company's website) are as follows: * SkimLinks - The company's first product. Released in 2008, it affiliates existing unaffiliated links on a user's site by adding a tracking tag on click. * SkimWords - The second product in the Skimlinks suite. It went live in 2010 and uses natural language processing technology to link specific phrases like product references and brand names to relevant online retailers. * The Showcases - They were released in May 2013 and are content-aware visual product displays that rely on technology similar to SkimWords', in order to generate geo-targeted, relevant product suggestions. * Skimlinks Editor - A Google Chrome extension, it allows users to know what merchants are in the Skimlinks network and how much they pay for referrals. It also has a price-comparison element, allowing users to see alternative purchasing options for the product they are browsing. Lastly, the Editor lets users shorten and monetise URLs straight from their browser. This makes it possible to share monetisable links on sites where Skimlinks isn't live. * Audiences by Skimlinks - The company's latest product, Audiences by Skimlinks is a 2nd party data co-op that makes the shopping-intent data generated from affiliated content available to marketers for planning, targeting or reporting advertising campaigns. Skimlinks also offers a series of extras, like the URL shortening of regular links into monetisable links, and SkimRSS which allows users to affiliate links in their RSS feeds.  Events  Since 2018, Skimlinks has organized the CAPS (The Commerce Awards for Publishers). The awards are the only affiliate industry program dedicated to recognizing publishers for the quality commerce content that they create. Past winners include Refinery29, New York Media, Vogue and Yahoo!

It was published in 1981 by University of Pittsburgh Press.  Synopsis  Cervantes’ first full collection of poetry illustrates the unique experience of a Chicana as she is coming of age. As Lynette Seator writes in her analysis of the work, “The poems of Emplumada tell the story of Cervantes' life, her life as it was given to her and as she learned to live it, taking into herself what was good and turning the bad into a comprehension of social context”. The work is split into three sections, with the first moving through the protagonist's childhood, the second and third moving through the protagonist's young adulthood and adulthood in the Mexican barrio of San Jose, California. The subject of the work, a 27-year-old Latina woman seems to appear consistently throughout the thirty-nine poems. Sometimes, she appears in the first person, while still other times she appears through an omniscient narrator Seator describes the structure of the poetry as, “an episodic progression through time”.  Major themes  = Abuse = In the very first poem, “Uncle’s First Rabbit,” Cervantes introduces the image of the Uncle, at around ten years old, seeing his father kick his pregnant mother, until his baby sister is born dead. :“...remembering that voice :like his dead baby sister’s, :remembering his father’s drunken :kicking that had pushed her into birth” The cycle of abuse continues, as the Uncle adopts similar behavior. Cervantes writes that the Uncle \\"finds himself slugging the bloodied face of his wife” The poem \\"Meeting Mescalito at Oak Hill Cemetery\\" alludes to abuse. The poem describes the life of a sixteen-year-old girl trying to escape an abusive household. She refers to an abusive stepfather in the lines :\\"...locked my bedroom :door against the stepfather\\". = Rape = In the poems “Lots: I” and “Lots: II”, Cervantes directly addresses the topic of rape. “In ‘Lots: I’ [the protagonist] fights off a rapist...in the succeeding poem, ‘Lots: II’ she is the victim of rape”. Seator attributes the sequential arrangement to Cervantes’ desire to overturn the typical trajectory for a Chicana woman in Chicano/a literature, allowing for the protagonist to assume the place and course of action of a male character in Chicano literature. Seator writes, “her loss of virginity and so of innocence is not the end of her as a viable human being. The author does not, as so many authors before her, do away with the female victim. The poet is determined that she as protagonist live. Loss of innocence is for her, as it has always been for the young male coming of age, a beginning.” = Identity = A source of tension for Cervantes’ protagonist emanates from her Chicana identity. “These are poems about the experience of growing up Chicana, poems that break away from old stereotypes rooted in the Mexican tradition and wrapped in the myths and the realities of both the Spanish and the Indian heritage”. The protagonist finds herself rooted by her up upbringing as a Chicana, but it is the way in which Cervantes presents this upbringing that reconstructs the identity of a Chicana protagonist. She adopts a strength typically associated with masculine characters. Reviewer Thelma T. Renya speaks of this strength in discussing the poem, “For Virginia Chavez,” when the protagonist's childhood friend has been beaten by her husband. Renya notes that is femininity and female relationships that emit strength. She writes, “it is the inner strength and solidarity of women that help them prevail”. = Language = Language becomes a source of both vigor and fragility, in that it grants her the ability to communicate, but it also connects her to her Chicana identity. This duality of language finds its crest in the poems “Barco de refugiados” and “Refugee Ship” which exist side by side in the work. Some critics find strength for the protagonist in her use of language. Seator writes, “Language is the linear progression of her history giving her more than a possibility of being. Language is a way of becoming.\\" While other critics find it to be a subjugator, “The worst tool of oppression, in Emplumada, appears to be language,” writes Scheidegger. She attributes language to “traumatic memories” and cites the protagonist's lack of words, manifested in intralinear spaces.  Publication history  Cervantes read one poem from her collection, “Refugee ship” at the Quinto Festival de los Teatros Chicanos in 1974. She had travelled to Mexico City with her brother, who was performing at the festival with the Theater of the People of San Jose and was asked to do a reading. Her performance was lauded in newspapers and journals. The collection is somewhat autobiographical. Lorna Dee Cervantes draws heavily from her own personal experiences and her family history. This has caused some friction with members of her family, such as her uncle, who refused to speak to her for many years after Emplumada was published. Cervantes’ personal experiences with racism, sexism, and classism appear constantly in her work.  Reception  The collection was well received by critics. In 1982, Emplumada was awarded the American Book Award. When it was first published, Emplumada circulated mostly in Chicana magazines. The American Book Award, however, opened the text up to much broader attention. Lorna Dee Cervantes is hailed as a leader of Chicano/a literature. Emplumada was praised for its ability to represent experiences common to Chicano/a readers while resonating with a universal audience. Reviewers raved over Cervantes’ ability to capture an underrepresented group. José Saldívar of Revista Chicano-Requeñ'a\\" wrote “No book has so carefully elucidated what living as a Chicana in the West means… Emplumada offers a number of troubled and delicate portraits of a woman’s world and how that antipatriarchal world has come to have meaning.” John Addiego of Northwest Review extaled, “Throughout Cervantes’ book there is the sense that an enormous but generally neglected audience being addressed. The Chicana experience, the long- suppressed voices struggling with racism, sexism, poverty, drug abuse, sexual abuse, is formed into a volume of linguistically rich outcries.\\" References American poetry collections 1981 poetry books Chicana feminism Mexican-American literature Hispanic and Latino American literature Literature by Hispanic and Latino American women Debut books ","title":"Emplumada"},{"id":"41159035","text":"Solariella delicatus is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Solariellidae.Bouchet, P.

He was the starting center in the 2001 NCAA Tournament national championship game for Duke, who won the game and were crowned national champions during his sophomore season. Playing career =High school= Sanders played for Tampa Preparatory School in Tampa, Florida from 1995 to 1999. During his four-year varsity career, he scored over 2,400 points and recorded more than 500 blocks. His average of 7.0 blocks per game in one season is the second-highest average in United States high school history, while his single game (19) and career blocks totals set Florida state all-time prep records. Sanders led Tampa Prep to three consecutive state tournament appearances over his final three seasons while the team went a combined 89–10 during that span. In his senior year, Sanders averaged 22 points, 11 rebounds and 7 blocks per game; he was named Florida's Class AAA Player of the Year, Florida Mr. Basketball, and a McDonald's All-American. He also recorded 26 triple-doubles during his high school career. =College= Sanders played for Duke University between 1999 and 2003. During his freshman year he averaged 1.8 points and 1.2 rebounds per game but was part of a freshman class who averaged a collective 40.5 points per game, which at the time was the fourth- highest total by a freshman class in Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) history. His contributions increased slightly the following year when he averaged 2.5 points, 1.8 rebounds and 0.9 blocks per game. During a home game against Maryland late in the ACC season, Duke's starting center Carlos Boozer broke his foot, leaving the Blue Devils—an already undersized team—without a veteran \\"big man\\" heading into the NCAA Tournament. Sanders made his first career start in the ACC Tournament championship game against Maryland, but his athleticism made Duke even quicker than before as they won the game. He went on to anchor Duke's defense throughout the NCAA Tournament. On April 2, 2001, the Blue Devils defeated Arizona 82–72 in the national championship game with Sanders as their starting center. His final two seasons at Duke were not as successful. The Blue Devils did not reach beyond the Sweet 16 in either year, and Sanders' season averages were still very low for a player who came out of high school as a top recruit. In his senior year in 2002–03, he accumulated more personal fouls (102) than made field goals (58). =Professional= No team selected Sanders in the 2003 NBA draft after his college career ended. With the exception of a 31-game stint for the NBA Development League's Roanoke Dazzle in 2005, he played his entire professional career overseas. Teams he played for include LF Basket in Sweden, Panteras de Miranda in Venezuela, and Unia Tarnów in Poland. Personal life Casey Sanders is the son of Jesse and Alice Jackson.

Byrd's cousin, polar explorer Richard E. Byrd, named Antarctica's Harold Byrd Mountains for him. Personal Background Byrd was born in Detroit, Texas on April 24, 1900, the youngest of eight children of Mary Easley Byrd and Edward Byrd, and grew up in Texas and Oklahoma.Texas State Historical Association, BYRD, DAVID HAROLD Byrd's cousin, polar explorer Richard E. Byrd, named Antarctica's Harold Byrd Mountains for him, after Byrd had contributed to the expedition that found them. Another cousin (Richard's brother) was Harry F. Byrd, who became a Democratic Party Governor of Virginia and a leading conservative US Senator. Byrd worked in the Burkburnett, Texas oilfield before attending Trinity University in 1917 and studying geology at the University of Texas in 1919–1921. During the summer vacations he worked at an oilfield in Santa Anna, Texas. Byrd married twice; on June 8, 1935, he married Mattie Caruth (March 7, 1908 to February 15, 1972) and again on February 14, 1974 - on her birthday - to the widow Mavis Barnett Heath (February 14, 1908 to April 9, 1998) following the death of his first wife in 1972. He had two sons from his first marriage. The two sons were David Harold Byrd Jr. and Caruth Clark Byrd. Mavis Barnett Heath was the widow of William Womack Heath (December 7, 1903 to June 22, 1971) and this couple were close friends to Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird Johnson. This Heath couple were instrumental in bringing the LBJ Library to the University of Texas. On September 14, 1986, David Harold 'Dry Hole' Byrd died while living in the City of Dallas, County of Dallas, Texas, and was buried at the Sparkman Hillcrest Memorial Park in that community which was also the resting place of his 1st wife. (See: findagrave.com) Oil business career After graduation, Byrd worked for H.E. Humphreys, and as a geological oil scout for several oil companies including Old Dominion Oil Company of San Antonio before becoming, in 1925, an independent consultant and driller in Brownwood, Texas. Here he acquired his \\"dry hole\\" nickname by drilling 56 wells that produced no oil until on 28 May 1928 he drilled two productive wells on the same day, one of them, the Byrd- Daniels Oil Field producing 1000 barrels a day at $3 a barrel. In 1931 Byrd founded Byrd-Frost Incorporated with Jack Frost, which operated 492 East Texas wells that produced an average of 4,000 barrels a day. In the 1930s he purchased the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas, scene of the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. Aviation business During this period Byrd became very interested in aviation. In 1938 he was named to the Texas Civil Aeronautics Commission by Texas Governor James Allred, and was involved in founding the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) in September 1941. During World War II Byrd commanded a CAP anti-submarine base at Beaumont, Texas. After the war Byrd helped incorporate CAP and have it designated as an Auxiliary of the Air Force, helped initiate the International Air Cadet Exchange, and established or supported cadet scholarships. For his work with the CAP Byrd was awarded the US Air Force's Air Force Scroll of Appreciation on 24 May 1963.Byrd (1978), I'm an Endangered Species, pp. 101-02; Scroll of Appreciation notice cited here LTV In 1944 Byrd founded Byrd Oil Corporation, which was later sold to Mobil Oil. That year he also founded B.H. Drilling Corporation. Byrd's Three States Natural Gas Company was sold to Delhi-Taylor Oil Corporation in 1961. In 1952 Byrd established the Three States Natural Gas Company, which he later sold to Delhi-Taylor, using the money to invest in aircraft production, co-founding Temco Aircraft, which in 1961 merged with friend James Ling's electronics company and aircraft manufacturer Chance Vought Corporation to form Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV).

The organization conducts user-centered research inside legislatures like the United States Congress, develops software for those who serve in government, and helps governments create policies and rules that support openness and effective engagement with the public. The organization was co-founded by Seamus Kraft and Congressman Darrell Issa in 2012, and it is currently funded primarily by the Democracy Fund, Twilio.org, Todd Park and Matt Cutts. In the past, The OpenGov Foundation has been funded by the Knight Foundation, Shuttleworth Foundation, the Rita Allen Foundation and the Consumer Technology Association. The organization is based in Washington, D.C and has offices in Philadelphia, PA and Wichita, KS. The OpenGov Foundation grew out of the 2011-2012 protests against SOPA and PIPA, creating a platform called Madison that allowed the public to directly and effectively engage alongside Members of Congress in the legislative process. It received a $200,000 grant from the Knight Foundation in 2013, an additional $750,000 from Knight in 2014, and over $700,000 from the Shuttleworth Foundation since 2014. In 2017, The OpenGov Foundation received $150,000 from the Twilio.org Impact Fund and $100,000 from Todd Park. In May 2017, The OpenGov Foundation released the fourth and last version of the Madison open source legislative engagement software. In June 2017, it began development of Article One, a cloud-based voice and SMS tool that supports meaningful engagement at scale between citizens and their Members of Congress. Current Projects =Article One= In May 2017, Twilio.org's Impact Fund awarded The OpenGov Foundation $150,000 to support the development of the Article One prototype. In June 2017, The OpenGov Foundation began in the U.S. Congress the development of Article One, a cloud-based communications tool that efficiently connects citizens and those who serve on their behalf in government. Article One leverages Twilio, Google Speech and Amazon Web Services to translate constituent communications into understandable, useful and actionable information for elected officials and government staff. The product is designed to help government better handle the skyrocketing volume of constituent telephone calls and other forms of communications, more effectively hear what their constituents are saying, and become more responsive to those they represent. Article One integrates directly with existing government communications infrastructure and constituent management software; for example, in the U.S. Congress Article One is integrated directly with constituent management system software provided by Fireside21 and Intranet Quorum. In February 2017, GovTech.com reported that seven Members of Congress were using Article One to better engage with their constituents. The OpenGov Foundation publicly demonstrated Article One to the Third Congressional Hackathon organized by Congressman Steny Hoyer and Congressman Kevin McCarthy in November 2017. This was the first public product demo of Article One, which CSPAN's \\"The Communicators\\" featured on May 20, 2018. In May 2018, The OpenGov Foundation and U.S. Congressman Rick Crawford launched an SMS-based engagement prototype as the second feature of Article One. =User-Centered Research: \\"From Voicemails to Votes\\"= During 2017, The OpenGov Foundation conducted the first-ever user-centered research on the United States Congress, publishing its findings and data under an open license as \\"From Voicemails to Votes.\\" To conduct the research, a team of four researchers embedded in 20 Congressional offices for four months, shadowing 58 staffers in both Washington, D.C. and district offices. According to Wired, the research \\"shows that despite how fractured Congress appears, constituent outreach really can work.\\" \\"From Voicemails to Votes\\" focuses on answering three core questions about Congressional operations and constituent communications. First, how do Congressional teams manage the process and operations of constituent engagement? Second, how does constituent input shape actions and decisions made by Members of Congress and their staff? And third, what capacity do Congressional teams have for change? In \\"From Voicemails to Votes,\\" The OpenGov Foundation published user stories for every role in a Congressional office, assessed technologies and mapped workflows currently in use for communicating with constituents, and put forward actionable recommendations to improve the efficiency, responsiveness and satisfaction of constituent engagement operations on Capitol Hill. =The Congressional Digital Service= During 2015 and 2016, The OpenGov Foundation developed the plan for the Congressional Digital Service (CDS) \\"to enable a more responsive and open Congress\\" with modern technology, design thinking and data science. The Democracy Fund supported the development of the CDS plan with a $175,000 grant. In 2017, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer drafted legislation to adopt The OpenGov Foundation's plan and create the CDS within the U.S. Library of Congress. As of May 2018, The Congressional Digital Service Act is awaiting formal introduction. CDS was inspired by two things. First, the successes of the government digital services teams founded under President Barack Obama—the United States Digital Service and 18F—which pioneered public sector adoption of modern product and service design practices. Second, a nation-wide series of Congressionally- focused hackathons co-organized by The OpenGov Foundation and the Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation--#Hack4Congress—demonstrated both growing interest for public service within the tech sector and the demand for better digital services within the U.S. Congress. The OpenGov Foundation's Executive Director Seamus Kraft has spoken widely on the need for CDS. At a March 13, 2017 event at the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, Kraft underscored the need for the CDS, saying, \\"Congress has been in the middle of a slow-motion Healthcare.gov crisis for decades. We have a Congress that is struggling with tech and the Internet age.\\" People = Staff = The OpenGov Foundation's full-time staff includes Executive Director Seamus Kraft, Deputy Executive Director Patrick Bateman, Director of Product Aaron Ogle, Senior Engineer Tanner Doshier, and Senior Engineer Seth Etter. The OpenGov Foundation's contract staff includes: Mollie Ruskin, Esther Kang, Hanya Moharram and Meag Doherty. = Board of Directors = The OpenGov Foundation Board of Directors for 2017-2018 includes: Phaedra Chrousos (Chair), Laurent Crenshaw (Vice- Chair), Rich Hirshberg (Treasurer), Seamus Kraft (Secretary), Michelle Lee (Director) and Aaron Snow (Director). The OpenGov Foundation Board of Directors for 2012-2016 included: Congressman Darrell Issa (Chair Emeritus), Seamus Kraft (Vice-Chair), Chris Birk (Director), Abhi Nemani (Director), Lanham Napier (Director), the Honorable Tom Davis (Director), Lawrence Brady (Director) and James Lacy. = Board of Advisors = In addition to a Board of Directors, The OpenGov Foundation has established a Board of Advisors to provide issue-specific expertise to the staff and Board of Directors. The OpenGov Foundation's 2017-2018 Board of Advisors includes: Dr. Anne Washington, Brandon Andrews, Jo-Marie St. Martin, Scout Addis, Karien Bezuidenhout, Janine Gianfredi, Peter Karman and Bob Sofman.  Awards & Recognitions  In 2012, TechCrunch named The OpenGov Foundation co-founder and Executive Director Seamus Kraft one of \\"The 20 Most Innovative People in Democracy\\" for his efforts creating the Madison policymaking platform. Other awardees included President Barack Obama, U.S. Senator Cory Booker, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Google's Eric Schmidt and President of Estonia Toomas Hendrick Ilves. In 2016, the American Library Association awarded The OpenGov Foundation team and Executive Director Seamus Kraft its highest honor, the James Madison Award, which is given annually \\"to honor individuals or groups who have championed, protected and promoted public access to government information and the public’s right to know at the national level.\\" Other recipients of the award include U.S. Senator John Tester, U.S. Senator John Cornyn, Aaron Swartz and U.S. Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren. The Washington, DC Legal Hackers have twice awarded The OpenGov Foundation a \\"Le Hackie.\\" In 2014, the Le Hackie was for \\"Organization of the Year\\" for spearheading the nation-wide Free Law Founders movement. In 2018, the Le Hackie was for conducting and publishing the first-ever user-centered research done on the United States Congress, \\"From Voicemails to Votes.\\" Past Projects =Madison= Madison is a government policy co-creation platform that opens up laws and legislation. Issa's congressional team launched Project Madison in December 2011 to support opposition to SOPA and PIPA in the U.S. Congress. A group of U.S. representatives and senators used Madison to develop alternative legislation, the Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act. Fast Company described the Madison beta version as \\"a stripped-down interactive blogging platform, which allows citizens to select individual passages of legislation, and strike or add their own language, with comments for each suggestion. Citizens are encouraged to like or dislike each change, with the most popular suggestions rising to the top.\\" Madison has since grown and been adopted by governments across the country and globe, including Washington, DC, the federal government of Mexico, and the United Nations. In February 2015, The White House used Madison to crowdsource its Public Participation Playbook. In 2016, Bloomberg Philanthropies \\"What Works Cities\\" program and the Sunlight Foundation began using Madison to develop municipal open data policies in the initiative's member cities, including Buffalo, NY, Syracuse, NY, Memphis, TN, Nashville, TN and Arlington, TX. In May 2017, The OpenGov Foundation released Madison 4.0 as open source software and ceased active development of the platform. = Open Source Software and Open Data in Government = The OpenGov Foundation has provided expert guidance to policymakers and staff on the use of open source software and open data at all levels of government in the United States. At the national level, The OpenGov Foundation spearheaded successful efforts in 2015 to allow Members of Congress to both use open source software and actively participate in open source software development. In a Huffington Post interview on the impact of the ruling, U.S. Congressman Jared Polis said, \\"By taking advantage of the newest technology and collaborating with the open source community, we can improve everything from the accessibility of congressional websites to the efficiency of business on the House floor. Personally, I can’t wait to begin integrating open source technology into my office’s daily operations.” At the local level, The OpenGov Foundation and the Free Law Founders coalition, which it co-founded in 2013 and continues to co-lead, have achieved two major victories advancing the public's access to the public laws in open data formats. In 2014, the City of San Francisco, CA, at the urging of then-Supervisor Mark Farrell, became the first city in the United States to adopt an open legal data framework for local laws. During the same year, the City of New York, NY became the first city in the United States to formally require its laws and legal codes be published in open data formats. New York City Council Member Ben Kallos drafted the \\"Law Online Act,\\" which New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio signed into law in August 2014. =The State Decoded= The State Decoded is an open source platform that displays legal codes, court decisions, and information from legislative tracking services to make it all more understandable. It was originally created by Waldo Jaquith for the Commonwealth of Virginia. The OpenGov Foundation subsequently launched a version for the state of Maryland in May 2013 and followed with Baltimore, MD, launched with the Baltimore Mayor's Office in July 2013. It has since launched in a total of eight city and state governments across the country, including San Francisco, Chicago, Florida, and Washington, DC. = Hack4Congress = In early 2015, The OpenGov Foundation partnered with the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation to organize a series of civic hackathons across the country, dubbed \\"Hack4Congress.\\" The events, held in Cambridge, San Francisco, and Washington, DC, drew hundreds of participants, including over a dozen Members of Congress, to build open source software prototypes to make Congress more efficient. = Work in Maryland = The OpenGov Foundation has worked in Maryland and its largest municipality, Baltimore, to custom develop software and data sets that increase government transparency, help citizens participate in their state and city governments, and hold them accountable. The Baltimore Sun described OpenGov’s work as a \\"test case for trying to make state and local government more transparent and participatory using technology.\\" The OpenGov Foundation's work in Maryland is funded by a grant awarded in 2013 by the Knight Foundation. = Work in Chicago = In March 2015, The OpenGov Foundation partnered with the City of Chicago to launch ChicagoCode.org, a product of The State Decoded, to make the city's laws and regulations more accessible to citizens. In March 2016, then-Chicago City Clerk Susana Mendoza and The OpenGov Foundation launched Envision Chicago, a scholarship contest in which Chicago high school students found city laws of interest to them using ChicagoCode.org and then proposed improvements to the law to their city officials. Four students won $1,000 scholarships through Envision Chicago. In addition to then-Clerk Mendoza, Alderman Ameya Pawar, Alderman Roberto Maldonado, Alderman Carrie Austin and Alderman Anthony Napolitano participated in the initiative. On July 20, 2016 the Chicago City Council passed legislation celebrating Envision Chicago and recognizing The OpenGov Foundation and all participating students. In remarks to the City Council, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel highlighted the importance of the initiative and the impact of The OpenGov Foundation's work with the City Council and community at large.

Each member of the Royal Family who undertakes public duties has his own separate Household. King George V (1865–1936) was created Duke of York in 1892, and received a separate household together with his brother. Courtiers appointed to assist the Prince George of Wales until that year had been part of his parents´ household. After his marriage to Princess Mary of Teck in 1893 they shared the Household of the Duke and Duchess of York. On the accession of his father, King Edward VII in January 1901, George automatically inherited the dukedom of Cornwall and was known as the Duke of Cornwall and York until the following November, when he was appointed Prince of Wales. From 1901 until his accession in 1910 he and his wife shared the Household of the Prince and Princess of Wales, but several appointments were to either the Prince or the Princess (e.g. they each had separate Lords Chamberlain and Private Secretaries). When he became King, his household was known as the Household of the Sovereign 1910–1936. Queen Mary (1867–1953) received a separate household upon her husband´s accession, the Household of the Queen. From 1936, it was known as the Household of Queen Mary.

He was noted as a Royalist supporter in the University of Oxford. Life Edwards was born 27 February 1600, and was educated at Merchant Taylors' School. In 1617 he was elected to a probationary fellowship at St John's College, Oxford. The former President of the college, William Laud, in 1632 recommended Edwards for the head-mastership of Merchant Taylors' School. He resigned this post at the close of 1634, and returned to Oxford. There Edwards served the office of proctor in the following year. In 1638 he was appointed Sedleian reader of natural philosophy, and proceeded to the degrees of M.B. and M.D. He appears to have resided in college during the troubled times that followed. In 1642, when the First English Civil War broke out, he was, with others, appointed by Convocation to provide accommodation for the troopers sent to Oxford, and procure arms to defend the university. In 1647 Edwards was summoned, as a delinquent, to appear before the committee of Lords and Commons for regulating the affairs of the university. His answers were considered unsatisfactory, he was placed by the parliamentary visitors in 1648 for a time in custody of the provost marshal for \\"manifold misdemeanours\\". His fellowship was taken from him, and he was superseded in the office of Sedleian reader by Joshua Crosse of Magdalen College. He was, however, paid for the readership until Michaelmas 1649.

She served as överhovmästarinna (Mistress of the Robes) at the Swedish royal court from 1693 to 1717. She is the author of a diary written between 1676 and 1698, which has been published and has been the object of research. Life Märta Berendes was the daughter of the nobleman Johan Berendes (d. 1652) and Ingeborg Kurck (d. 1654). She inherited a fortune after her father's death. In 1656, she married her uncle's brother-in-law, baron Johan Sparre of Bohnerö and Walstanäs (d. 1659). She describes this marriage as happy, but her spouse was sickly, and left her a widow with two children. In 1662, she married secondly to riksråd baron Gustaf Posse af Hedensund till Arnäs (1626-1676). She also described this marriage as happy, but her second spouse, like the first, was sickly, and he and four of her children all died of smallpox in 1675-76. After her second widowhood, she attended to the management of her fortune and estates to support her children, until she was given an office at court in 1687. She had eleven children, but only two survived her. In 1689 she lost her two adult sons, Axel Sparre and Carl Gustaf Posse, who fell in battle in military service on the continent, and in 1698 she lost her daughter Margareta in childbirth. =Court career= Märta Berendes served as maid of honour to queen Christina of Sweden in 1652-1654, and to the next queen, Hedvig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp, in 1654-1656, her aunt Kerstin Kurck having already held that position. In her autobiography, she commented that she did not wish to become a maid of honour as she disliked the life at court and accepted the office only to avoid offending the queen, and that she in fact seldom served, having to take leave to attend her sick mother.Hertha, Number 5, 1918 From 1687 until 1715, she served as Mistress of the Robes to the queen dowager Hedvig Eleonora. After the death of the queen, Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark in 1693, the queen dowager was in effect the first lady of the Swedish court, making Berendes in effect first in rank of all female courtiers. From 1693 until her death, she had was additionally given the office of överhovmästarinna (in this case in effect that of royal governess) at the court of the princesses, Hedvig Sophia of Sweden and Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden. Berendes was described as a melancholic and passionately religious widow. She had an important position at court, being treated with familiarity by the royal family: King Charles XII of Sweden referred to her as 'Old Aunt'. In 1709, she participated in the court camarilla consisting of herself, Arvid Horn, the queen dowager's priest Molin, Beata Sparre and Christina Piper who formed an alliance with Carl Gyllenstierna and successfully evicted Anna Catharina von Bärfelt from court.Fabian Persson (1999).

The movie follows the three musicians as they perform songs on Jakarta's commuter buses, clash with the law and confront the tumultuous politics of modern-day Indonesia. It follows them back to their home villages in East Java and traces their quest for legitimacy, identity and love in their adopted city of Jakarta. Jalanan won the Best Documentary prize at the prestigious Busan International Film Festival in October, 2013.  Plot  The film follows the three musicians over five years as they struggle to earn a living busking on Jakarta's crowded city buses.

The film follows the young marginalized musicians and their never before seen sub-culture, while also painting a striking, moody and intimate portrait of Indonesia's frenzied capital city. Using the powerful soundtrack of the musicians' original compositions to drive the film, it traces their elusive quest for identity and love in the day-to- day of a city overrun by the effects of globalization and corruption.  Influence & Political Impact in Indonesia  Jalanan became the first documentary in Indonesian history to receive a full theatrical release in commercial cinemas across the country.

Its three largest components were Ahrar ash-Sham, the al-Tawhid Brigade and Jaysh al-Islam. The alliance was achieved by expanding the preceding Syrian Islamic Front alliance. It was described as \\"an umbrella organization rather than a full union\\", with constituent factions continuing to serve under their own distinct leaderships. The Islamic Front wanted to transform Syria into an Islamic state after they overthrow the government of President Bashar. It did not recognise most formal structures of the syrian opposition, such as the Syrian National Council. The alliance fragmented over the course of 2014 with its larger constituent parts retaining strong independent identities. On 24 December 2014, the Islamic Front factions in the Aleppo Governorate formed the Levant Front alliance with other armed groups in northern Syria. In 2015, Salafist Ahrar ash-Sham – a major component of the Islamic Front alliance – joined with jihadi groups under the Army of Conquest operations room umbrella, successfully campaigning against the Syrian Arab Army in the northern districts from March to September 2015. The group however continued nominal membership of the Islamic Front alliance, despite its more jihadist orientation. By early 2015, the Islamic Front was being described as virtually defunct, with the largest member groups Ahrar ash-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam remaining separate entities, and the smaller IF factions Liwa al-Haqq, Suqour al-Sham Brigade and Kurdish Islamic Front being absorbed into Ahrar ash-Sham. History =Founding= Founding of the Islamic Front on 22 November 2013 After three months of protests in 2011, many Salafist Islamist prisoners managed to be released from Sednaya Prison, including Zahran Alloush and Hassan Aboud. They formed their own Islamist groups and took up arms against the Syrian Government. Many of them became leaders of Islamist groups in the Islamic Front such as Jaysh al-Islam and Ahrar ash- Sham. Some of those groups formed an Islamist alliance named the Syrian Islamic Front. In November 2013, the Syrian Islamic Front was dissolved, as the organization was replaced by the Islamic Front. On 22 November 2013, seven Islamist groups agreed to a pact that would dissolve the groups individually and lead to the formation of the Islamic Front. The groups were: * Aleppo's largest opposition fighting force Al-Tawhid Brigade (formerly part of the Syrian Islamic Liberation Front) * Salafist Ahrar ash-Sham (formerly part of the Syrian Islamic Front) * Homs-based Liwa al-Haqq (formerly part of Syrian Islamic Front) * Idlib-based Suqour al-Sham (formerly part of the Syrian Islamic Liberation Front) * Damascus-based Jaysh al-Islam (formerly part of Syrian Islamic Liberation Front) * Ansar al-Sham (formerly part of the Syrian Islamic Front) * Kurdish Islamic Front The Syrian Islamic Front tweeted that it had disbanded and its component groups would hereby operate under the Islamic Front. Not all groups in the Syrian Islamic Liberation Front joined the Islamic Front, although many of the key leaders of the SILF did. The Syrian Islamic Liberation Front announced its dissolution on 26 November 2013. The leadership of the Islamic Front at the time of its founding was announced as Shura Council Leader: Ahmed Abu Issa (Suqour al-Sham), Deputy Shura Council Leader: Abu Omar Hreitan (Liwa al-Tawhid), General Secretary: Sheikh Abu Rateb (Liwa al-Haqq), Sharia Office: Abul-Abbas al-Shami (Ahrar ash-Sham), Political Office: Hassan Abboud (Ahrar ash-Sham) and Military Office: Zahran Alloush (Jaysh al-Islam) A Liwa al-Tawhid member said the old names \\"will disappear and the groups will now melt into the new merger. There will be no such thing as Liwa al-Tawhid.\\" The head of the group's Consultative Council, Amad Essa al-Sheikh, said the group sought \\"a paradigm shift in the armed rebellion by closing ranks and mobilising them to become the real alternative to the dying regime.\\" He added that the group would cooperate with what it called \\"loyal fighters\\" in the country, including the Free Syrian Army (FSA). An anonymous spokesman for the group stated that it would not have ties with the Syrian National Coalition, although a member of the political bureau of the group, Ahmad Musa, stated that he hoped for recognition by the Syrian National Council in line with what he suggested \\"the Syrian people want. They want a revolution and not politics and foreign agendas.\\" Despite non-recognition of the authority of the Syrian National Coalition, and criticism of the FSA's Supreme Military Council (SMC), the Islamic Front was aligned with other Syrian opposition-affiliated groups under the Syrian Revolutionary Command Council. However on 3 December 2013, Liwa al-Tawhid withdrew from the command of the FSA and criticized its leadership. On 6 December 2013, fighters from the Islamic Front seized several FSA bases and depots at the Bab al-Hawa crossing. This caused conflict between the two groups that lasted until later in December 2013. The new group claimed 70,000 fighters, although it was estimated by Charles Lister of IHS Jane's that the total number of fighters the Islamic Front commanded on formation was at least 45,000. =Background= The formation of the front followed the death of Liwa al-Tawhid's military leader, Abdul Qader Saleh, from wounds a week earlier following an air strike in Aleppo, where he was meeting other leaders. A group member, Adil Fistok, said the planning was in the works for seven months; Fistok stated that \\"One of the major obstacles we faced was the lust for power by some leaders. But eventually everyone made concessions in order to make this project happen.\\" According to him, the primary challenge was a lack of money and weapons. =Later events= In December 2013, the Islamic Front seized the FSA headquarters, along with key supply warehouses in Atmeh, as well as the nearby border crossing with Turkey at Bab al-Hawa. FSA Chief-of-Staff Brigadier General Salim Idris fled via Turkey to Doha, Qatar, during the assault. However, the FSA denied that Idris had left Syria, and said that the Islamic Front was asked to help the FSA fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The FSA confirmed on 13 December 2013 that the Islamic Front had obtained machine guns and ammunition that were not supposed to be in the possession of the Islamists. Later that month, however, the Islamic Front and the Free Syrian Army reconciled. By early 2014, the Islamic Front had condemned the actions of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; and some factions within the alliance attacked it. Several Islamic Front brigades, including Suqour al-Sham and Ahrar ash-Sham, developed internal divisions on how to or even whether to confront the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Several defections from the Islamic Front to Free Syrian Army groups were reported in 2014, including around 800 fighters in eastern Aleppo Governorate in August 2014, with new FSA units created by the defectors, who condemned the Islamic Front's Islamist and sectarian practices, especially against Christians and Alawites who initially supported the opposition. On 9 September 2014, Hassan Abboud, the Islamic Front's political leader, and Abu Abdulmalek al-Sharei, the head of the Islamic Front's Sharia Council, were killed along with many other senior Ahrar ash-Sham commanders, when a bomb went off as a high-level meeting was going on near an ammunition dump in Idlib province. In 2014, several units left al-Tawhid Brigade, including the Elite Islamic Battalions and the 1st Regiment. There was also tension between Jaysh al-Islam and Ahrar al-Sham. By March 2015, it was considered effectively defunct by analysts as one of its key components, Suqour al-Sham, merged into Ahrar al- Sham. Funding and international support The group was widely reported to be backed and armed by Saudi Arabia,Syrian FSA fades in shadow of Saudi-backed opposition front, Al-Monitor, 11 December 2013Syria’s Saudi jihadist problem, Daily Beast, 16 December 2013Al-Qaeda and ISIS: The Renunciation of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Al Akhbar, 4 February 2014 although other analysts have said there is little evidence for Saudi Arabian support for factions other than Jaysh al-Islam. Other constituent factions, principally the Tawhid Brigade, have been reported as Qatari-backed. The Front has been widely reported as close to Turkey. The Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s has been linked to some members in the Islamic Front (Syria). A leaked German intelligence document from May 2015 suggested the Islamic Front and Ahrar ash- Sham in particular had received weapons from Turkey. Other Terrorist groups had supported the Islamic Front (Syria). The Jabhat al-Nusra (JN) have publicity supported the Islamic Front (Syria) as long as the Islamic Front does not create any western ties or leave out Arab regimes. \\"Muhammad al- Mohaisany, a rising star in the jihadist community and a key financier of rebel efforts in northern Syria -- released a video message backing Islamic Front (Syria) on social media platforms.\\" However, ISIS is feeling uneasy from the formation of the Islamic Front because they are competitors in Syria. The United States has not designated the Islamic Front (Syria) as a global jihadist group because they not want to establish a caliphate. As a result, the United States government has not recognized the group to be a danger to American lives. However, many of the United States allies could back this group which politically could be an issue for the United States. Views and objectives The Islamic Front released its charter on the Internet in late November 2013, outlining its aims and objectives, although the document avoided providing a clear vision of the future. The Islamic Front's charter rejects the concepts of representative democracy and secularism, instead seeking to establish an Islamic state ruled by a Majlis-ash-Shura and implementing sharia. It acknowledges the ethnic and religious minorities that live in Syria, while also welcoming the foreign fighters who have joined the anti-Assad forces and rejecting non-military means of ending the civil war. One member of the political assembly of the group has stated that the Islamic Front could accept Syria as a democracy, as long as sharia is \\"sovereign\\". The Islamic Front said it aspires \\"to establish an independent state where God's merciful law is sovereign and where the individuals of this state enjoy justice and a dignified life.\\" According to the Islamic Front, they only want to unify Muslims under one Islamic State. The group has stated that they will not punish non-Muslims, but will instead create a second class citizen system for Christians and other religious denominations. The Islamic Front (Syria) has been very open to allowing other smaller rebel groups join their movement as long as they share similar beliefs. The Islamic Front criticized ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant), saying: \\"They killed the people of Islam and leave the idol worshippers\\" and \\"They use the verses talking about the disbelievers and implement it on the Muslims\\". In 2013, before the Front was formed, its future military leader Zahran Alloush gave a speech attacking Shi'ites, whom he called \\"Rafidis\\", the Alawites and \\"the Zoroastrians\\", saying \\"the mujahediin of Sham [the Levant] will wash the filth (رجس) of the Rafida and the Rafidia from Sham... if Allah wills it, until they cleanse Bilad al-Sham [the land of the Levant] from the filth of the Majous [Fireworshippers] who have fought the religion of Allah\\"; \\"Shia are still servile and small (أذلاء صاغرين ) throughout history\\"; and \\"I bid you, o unclean (أنجاس) Rafida, that as the Banu Umayya [ Umayyads] destroyed your skulls in the past, the people of the Ghouta and the people of Sham will destroy your skulls in the future\\". Alloush and Hassan Aboud, heading the Islamic Front's political office, have denounced democracy and called for an Islamic state to succeed Assad. However in a May 2015 interview with McClatchy journalists, Alloush used moderate rhetoric, claiming that Syrians should decide what sort of state they wanted to live under and that Alawites were \\"part of the Syrian people\\" and only those with blood on their hands should be held accountable. His spokesman went on to claim that the sectarian and Islamist rhetoric Alloush had previously made was only intended for internal consumption and to rally his fighters.  Claimed Attacks/ Description of Attacks  The Islamic Front (Syria) has claimed for forty five attacks from 2012 to 2015. The country that the Islamic Front (Syria) has been active in has only been in Syria and only in the major cities. The most deadly attacks occurred on the same day on December 14, 2014 on two different military bases. The Islamic Front killed ninety soldiers at each location and took fifteen soldiers hostage and their where about are still unknown to this day. The majority of their attacks are assaults with explosives (thirty seven attacks) but they have used armed assaults as well in their attacks as well (three times). The Majority of their targets were military personnel (twenty three attacks) but a close second was private citizens (nineteen attacks); Forty three percent of the attacks were against military personnel, thirty five percent of the attacks were against private citizens, and all other attacks involved were around twenty percent of the attacks.

This is a hyperbolic group whose Gromov boundary is a Cantor set. Hyperbolic groups and their boundaries are important topics in geometric group theory, as are Cayley graphs. The (6,4,2) triangular hyperbolic tiling. The triangle group corresponding to this tiling has a circle as its Gromov boundary. In mathematics, the Gromov boundary of a δ-hyperbolic space (especially a hyperbolic group) is an abstract concept generalizing the boundary sphere of hyperbolic space. Conceptually, the Gromov boundary is the set of all points at infinity. For instance, the Gromov boundary of the real line is two points, corresponding to positive and negative infinity. Definition There are several equivalent definitions of the Gromov boundary of a geodesic and proper δ-hyperbolic space. One of the most common uses equivalence classes of geodesic rays. Pick some point O of a hyperbolic metric space X to be the origin. A geodesic ray is a path given by an isometry \\\\gamma:[0,\\\\infty)\\\\rightarrow X such that each segment \\\\gamma([0,t]) is a path of shortest length from O to \\\\gamma(t). Two geodesics \\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2 are defined to be equivalent if there is a constant K such that d(\\\\gamma_1(t),\\\\gamma_2(t))\\\\leq K for all t. The equivalence class of \\\\gamma is denoted [\\\\gamma]. The Gromov boundary of a geodesic and proper hyperbolic metric space X is the set \\\\partial X=\\\\\\\\{[\\\\gamma]\\\\gamma is a geodesic ray in X\\\\\\\\}. =Topology= It is useful to use the Gromov product of three points. The Gromov product of three points x,y,z in a metric space is (x,y)_z=1/2(d(x,z)+d(y,z)-d(x,y)). In a tree (graph theory), this measures how long the paths from z to x and y stay together before diverging. Since hyperbolic spaces are tree-like, the Gromov product measures how long geodesics from z to x and y stay close before diverging. Given a point p in the Gromov boundary, we define the sets V(p,r)=\\\\\\\\{q\\\\in \\\\partial X there are geodesic rays \\\\gamma_1,\\\\gamma_2 with [\\\\gamma_1]=p, [\\\\gamma_2]=q and \\\\lim \\\\inf_{s,t\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}(\\\\gamma_1(s),\\\\gamma_2(t))_O\\\\geq r\\\\\\\\}. These open sets form a basis for the topology of the Gromov boundary. These open sets are just the set of geodesic rays which follow one fixed geodesic ray up to a distance r before diverging. This topology makes the Gromov boundary into a compact metrizable space. The number of ends of a hyperbolic group is the number of components of the Gromov boundary. Properties of the Gromov boundary The Gromov boundary has several important properties. One of the most frequently used properties in group theory is the following: if a group G acts geometrically on a δ-hyperbolic space, then G is hyperbolic group and G and X have homeomorphic Gromov boundaries. One of the most important properties is that it is a quasi-isometry invariant; that is, if two hyperbolic metric spaces are quasi-isometric, then the quasi-isometry between them gives a homeomorphism between their boundaries. This is important because homeomorphisms of compact spaces are much easier to understand than quasi- isometries of spaces. Examples *The Gromov boundary of a tree is a Cantor space. *The Gromov boundary of hyperbolic n-space is an (n-1)-dimensional sphere. *The Gromov boundary of the fundamental group of a compact Riemann surface is the unit circle. *The Gromov boundary of most hyperbolic groups is a Menger sponge. Generalizations =Visual boundary of CAT(0) space= For a complete CAT(0) space X, the visual boundary of X, like the Gromov boundary of δ-hyperbolic space, consists of equivalence class of asymptotic geodesic rays. However, the Gromov product cannot be used to define a topology on it. For example, in the case of a flat plane, any two geodesic rays issuing from a point not heading in opposite directions will have infinite Gromov product with respect to that point. The visual boundary is instead endowed with the cone topology. Fix a point o in X. Any boundary point can be represented by a unique geodesic ray issuing from o. Given a ray \\\\gamma issuing from o, and positive numbers t > 0 and r > 0, a neighborhood basis at the boundary point [\\\\gamma] is given by sets of the form : U(\\\\gamma, t, r) = \\\\\\\\{[\\\\gamma_1]\\\\in\\\\partial X  \\\\gamma_1(0)=o, d( \\\\gamma_1(t),\\\\gamma(t))< r\\\\\\\\}. The cone topology as defined above is independent of the choice of o. If X is proper, then the visual boundary with the cone topology is compact. When X is both CAT(0) and proper geodesic δ-hyperbolic space, the cone topology coincides with the topology of Gromov boundary. Cannon's Conjecture Cannon's conjecture concerns the classification of groups with a 2-sphere at infinity: Cannon's conjecture: Every Gromov hyperbolic group with a 2-sphere at infinity acts geometrically on hyperbolic 3-space. The analog to this conjecture is known to be true for 1-spheres and false for spheres of all dimension greater than 2.

Abstract The effects of Gongjin-Dan(GDJ) on NGF mimetic activity in PC12 cells and the induction of NGF secretion in primary astrocytes. Moreover, we also measured neuron survival by MAP-2 staining in an immobilization stress rat model and induction of long-term potentiation by the MEA system in rat hippocampus slices treated with dexamethasone. The behavioral syndrome by novel object test was also performed in mice. GJD increased neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells and NGF secretion in primary astrocytes. Also, it reduced neuronal cell death and increased long-term potentiation in the rat hippocampus. Moreover, the number of entries, the time spent and the distance moved in the center area of the test region by the mice was increased by oral administration of GJD in comparison with the distance moved over the total area. These data suggest that administration of GJD may improve memory and learning tasks via NGF regulation, and that it may have a potential for multiple function neuroprotection via NGF regulation.

The song was the first single to be released digitally from the soundtrack of the 2013 film Gori Tere Pyaar Mein. The digital release was on 12 October 2013 in India. The music video was released on 9 October and launched on radio on 16 October. A typical filmi song and item number, the song's video depicts the fun and humour that prevail at traditional Punjabi weddings.  Background and composition  In an interview with radio jockey, Anuraag Pandey, Vishal–Shekhar revealed that the soundtrack being the second collaboration between Malhotra and them—after 2010s I Hate Luv Storys, they were involved right composing tunes with the completion of each draft of the script from the beginning in their studio (located in Bandra, Mumbai) in presence of Malhotra. During one such session four tunes were composed, the first being the final one based on the opinion of several people; who were asked to present their verdict on the best one. \\"Tooh\\" was written by Anvita Dutt Guptan and produced by Abhijit Nalani. It was recorded at Vishal–Shekhar's personal studio in Bandra, Mumbai by recording engineers, Satchith Harve, Abhishek Ghatak and, Gauvrav Gupta—with the tune being mixed by Shekhar Ravjiani himself—and mastering by Chris Gehringer at Sterling Sound, New York City.

An item number, and wedding song aside from being a filmi number \\"Tooh\\" features an array of wedding song \\"paraphernalia\\" including brass synthesizer and dhol.  Music video  The video was directed by the director of the film, Punit Malhotra. The costumes and choreography were done by Manish Malhotra and Remo D'Souza, respectively. It features Kareena Kapoor wearing the most elaborate of her six costumes for the film. The video— begins with a group of Indian outfit (mostly sarees) wearing females dancing, a man wearing a turban standing between them. Kapoor appears in a huge hall prepared for hosting a Punjabi wedding; a sangeet (a type of bridal shower in north Indian wedding rituals). She along with women of different ages wearing sarees or lehngas dance on a stage. In front of the stage are several middle-aged men (wearing white Kurtas) dancing. Imran Khan appears, wearing a black kurta watching the girls on stage. The baraat then arrives at a well-lit and decorated bungalow; the bridegroom rides a horse (a custom of traditional north-western Indian weddings) and dancers in front of the procession in an alley leading to the bungalow with Khan, wearing a tuxedo, joining them. After the dancing, the video concludes as the duo embrace.  Release and reception  The single was released on digital music platform ITunes on 12 October 2013, followed by a radio-release on 16 October 2013. It is the second item number featuring Kareena Kapoor; the first being \\"Fevicol Se\\" from the 2012 film Dabangg 2. = Reception = Upon release, \\"Tooh\\" received mixed reviews. Its lyrics were criticised for being objectionable; mediocre and unoriginal, along with the frequent use of the word \\"Tooh\\"— but was noted for its ecstatic and groovy nature. The dance steps from the song's music video caught on with revellers adding to the popularity of the single. The song's lyrics include multiple instances of the word \\"Tooh\\"Punjabi for \\"buttocks\\", which became controversial in India. The Central Board of Film Certification faced criticism for passing the song without objection, even though it included profanity. Shekhar Ravjiani, one of the song's composers, defended the song, refuting claims that the song is obscene. The lyrics have also been criticised for their lack of poetry, which was the mainstay of songs in Bollywood classics like Pyaasa and Sujata. Lyricist Kausar Munir blames the attention span of the listeners and the commercial aspect of the films for the rude and offensive lyrics of modern songs; including those of \\"Tooh\\".

Early medical authors such as Thomas Lathrop Stedman of Stedman's Medical Dictionary discuss its meaning and its definition in their various medical writings as having a pelvic oblique diameter of 24 cm or greater for a gynecoid type pelvis. See: Justo major pelvis It is a rare symmetrical type enlargement of the female pelvis. Originally the 2.0 or more above average pelvis size (using the average 12 cm pelvic oblique diameter) would be required for size minimum. More recently using 1.5 or more symmetrical enlargement above average is used for its modern definition. 2.0 would be a very limiting value for its incidence, so the minimum size requirement for definition was lowered. As the condition requires a symmetrical pelvis, different pelvis measures divided by well known averages for those measures are used for this approximate pelvis size ratio relationship. Commonly the term—Pelvic Index—is often used to describe its percentage over average. 1.5 to 1 in that terminology instead becomes 1.5 times 100% of average, which is a Pelvic Index of 150 for the minimum pelvis size enlargement to be Giant Pelvis. http://i1000.photobucket.com/albums/af122/alkanalkan/Justo-Major-Steaman- authority.jpg~original Thomas Lathrop Stedman References Pelvis Medical terminology ","title":"Giant pelvis"},{"id":"41160498","text":"Ideal Lofts is an architecturally noted low-rise soft loft condominium apartment building in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at Markham Street and College Street in the downtown neighbourhoods of Little Italy and Trinity–Bellwoods. The project was developed by Context and designed by Peter Clewes, Prishram Jain and Robert Cadeau of architectsAlliance. Cecconi Simone and Crayon Design designed the interiors.Ideal Condo brochure. Context Development Inc, 1999 The building was registered on August 19, 2002. Description The building's design received an \\"honourable mention\\" at the City of Toronto’s Architecture and Urban Design Awards 2003. One judge noted that \\"it's a very impressive example of the Toronto urban loft-housing model.\\" According to a multiple award winning City of Toronto study the building is a good precedent of a context sensitive and well-massed mid-rise building. It is respectful of the neighbourhood houses along Markham Street to the south. The massing, materials, and façade of the building take their cue from three neighbouring 19th century warehouse buildings each with a strong red brick base. The three buildings are: 474 Bathurst St, Pedlar People Building at 473-489 College St, and the Ladies Wear Building at 559 College St. The City of Ottawa Design and Planning Guidelines also make reference to Ideal Lofts. According to Robert Freedman, architect and then director of urban design for the City of Toronto, Ideal Lofts is part of a trend toward better designed condos in Toronto. The name Ideal Lofts comes from the Ideal Restaurant Supply store which previously stood on the site. The nine-story brick and precast concrete condo has 68 units from one bedroom studios to three-bedroom penthouses. Dimension range from: 1 bedroom: 514–700 ft2, 1+1 bedroom: 700–800 ft2, 2 bedroom: 800–1300 ft2, and penthouse: 1260–2232 ft2. The units per floor each have different layouts. All have floor-to-ceiling windows. The sixth and eighth floors are two-story lofts with glass and concrete terraces. Many units have permanent, unobstructed views of residential streets lined with houses. South facing units overlook neighboring back gardens beyond the grasses and trees on the condo's lower green roof and a section of Lake Ontario is still in view for many. To the west and north, the view takes in treetops and heritage buildings. The units facing either south or west have terraces or balconies. The lofts facing north have juliet balconies.

It was made available on BBC iPlayer and YouTube on 21 November 2013, as part of the BBC One lead-up to the show's 50th anniversary special. Synopsis The episode is seen through the eyes of a newly recruited soldier in Arcadia, the \\"safest place on Gallifrey\\", on their first day in the defence of their home planet during the Time War. The new recruit is having a headcama recording device linked directly to the brainadjusted by one of their fellow soldiers. The recruit is informed of the potential risk of hallucinations as a side effect of the technology and is told that the visions are not premonitions. The instructor goes on to say that in the event of death, the memories recorded will be extracted and placed on a \\"family drive\\". The soldier then meets his commander, who gives him an introductory speech about their defences. He describes \\"sky-trenches\\", the planetary defences that hold back invading forces. He tells the soldier that there are four hundred sky-trenches guarding Arcadia and that nothing in history has ever breached two of them, though during his speech, huge explosions can be seen up above. The instructor takes the soldier to a defensive turret and instructs him on using scanners to check for objects in the sky. He tells the soldier that they must be thorough and vigilant, as it would only take one Dalek to wipe out the entire city. The instructor directs the soldier to zoom in on a potential targetwhich he assumes is a birdbut is horrified to see that it is in fact a Dalek. The Dalek is quickly joined by many more, and the skies fill with the invading forces. A Dalek fires its extermination ray at the soldier, who screams as the headcam display flashes red and then fades to static.  Production  \\"The Last Day\\" was recorded at Roath Lock on 9 May 2013. The remark that moments of \\"an intimate nature will be flagged with a triangle\\" is a reference to an experiment adopted by Channel 4 from September 1986 to January 1987, in which explicit adult art films screened at night carried a superimposed red warning triangle.

The novel won the National Book Award for Fiction in 2013 and received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot The memoirs of Henry Shackleford, a slave in Kansas during the Bleeding Kansas era, are discovered in a Delaware church. Henry, nicknamed \\"Little Onion\\" for eating a particularly rancid onion, accidentally encounters abolitionist John Brown in a tavern. Brown mistakes Henry for a girl and gives him a dress to wear; Shackleford wears a dress for much of the novel. The two join together, and Henry narrates his encounters with Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and the events at John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry. The book is narrated in the first person through Henry. Reception The novel received generally positive reviews from critics, with several reviewers comparing it to Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884). In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Héctor Tobar called the novel \\"laugh-out-loud funny and filled with many wonderfully bizarre images\\", but noted the lack of humanity in comparison to Huckleberry Finn or Middle Passage (1990). Tobar went on to say \\"those looking for verisimilitude or gravitas in their historical fiction might want to avoid The Good Lord Bird.\\" Laura Miller of Salon drew comparisons between the novel and Huckleberry Finn, specifically comparing the moral awakening of Finn to the journey of Henry; writer Christine Brunkhorst notes how Onion and Finn both encounter \\"drunken rebels, brutal slave owners, spineless men, clairvoyant women, crooked judges and some brave and principled people.\\" In a review for the San Francisco Chronicle, novelist Amity Gaige praised McBride's \\"reimagining\\" of Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry and added that he \\"[managed] to novelize real historical events without dreary prostrations to the act\\". The novel won the National Book Award for Fiction in 2013. National Book Award judges called McBride \\"a voice as comic and original as any we have heard since Mark Twain.\\" McBride did not prepare an acceptance speech, as he thought he would not win, and was described as \\"clearly stunned\\" upon receiving the award.

This coordination complex is widely used in hydrosilylation catalysis. It is a colorless solid that is generally assumed to be a mixture of related Pt(0) alkene complexes. The catalyst is named after Bruce D. Karstedt, who developed it in the early 1970s while working for General Electric. Applications Carbon-silicon bonds are often generated via hydrosilylation of alkenes. This reaction has very important applications to industry. While it is favorable thermodynamically, hydrosilylation does not proceed in the absence of a catalyst, such as Karstedt's catalyst. The catalyst is produced by treatment of chloroplatinic acid by the divinyltetramethyldisiloxane. The catalyst can also be used in a reductive amination reaction between a carboxylic acid and an amine with phenylsilane as the reducing agent. Structure and bonding The oxidation state of the platinum is 0. Using X-ray crystallography, the structure of Pt2[(Me2SiCH=CH2)2O]3 has been confirmed. Each Pt(0) center is surrounded by three alkene ligands provided by three 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-1,3-divinyldisiloxane ligands.

Its objective was the maintenance of the privileges, rights, and freedoms of its members, and it therefore also opposed the territorial ambitions of increasingly assertive surrounding states within the Holy Roman Empire such as Bavaria, Württemberg, and Austria. Beginnings The Swabian League of Cities was first formed on 20 November 1331, when twenty-two imperial cities of the former Duchy of Swabia banded together in support of the Emperor Louis IV, who in return promised not to mortgage any of them to any imperial vassal. Among the founding cities were Augsburg, Heilbronn, Reutlingen, and Ulm. The counts of Württemberg, Oettingen, and Hohenberg were induced to join in 1340. Conflict and renewal Under the rule of the Emperor Charles IV (reigned 1355–1378), the lesser Swabian nobles began to combine against the cities, and formed the Schleglerbund (from Schlegel, a maul). With civil war ensuing in 1367, the emperor, jealous of the growing power of the cities, endeavoured to set up a league under his own control for the maintenance of public peace (Landfriedensbund, 1370). =The mid-fourteenth-century political context= The Emperor, Charles IV was determined that his son Wenceslas should be elected “King of the Romans”. Top positions in the Holy Roman Empire were elective positions. The prince-electors were the leading lords of the empire, and back in the fourteenth century there could be nothing automatic about their decisions. Nevertheless, a tradition had by then been established whereby the “King of the Romans” tended to be elected in succession when a Holy Roman Emperor died, so that the effect of the emperor’s ambition for his son was that Wenceslas (sometimes later distinguished by the sobriquet “Wenceslas the Idle”) should be elected as his own heir apparent. In order to win the necessary votes, Emperor Charles needed to gain support from the prince-electors and those in a position to influence them; this was traditionally achieved with gifts of money or land. The towns and cities were likely to end up bearing the burden of making good the resulting shortfall in imperial finances. Small and middle-sized cities had good reason to fear that they might find themselves pledged by the empire as a security to noble creditors if promised payments failed to be made timely: in 1376 that is what happened to Donauwörth. The cities’ independence and their direct relationship with the emperor, which was designed to liberate them from the cupidity of lords and princes closer to home, was implicitly under threat. They therefore demanded of the emperor the protection and inviolability enshrined in the “imperial immediacy” relationship. At the same time, the shared need of the imperial cities to secure their rights and privileges led them to form an alliance. Collection of the emperor’s dues was a duty that fell on local lords, and in Württemberg that meant the Prince of Württemberg, who was in any case the emperor’s local representative from 1373. For Eberhard II of Württemberg, the privileged imperial cities were impediments to the extension of the power and influence of Württemberg, and so he had good reason of his own to align his interests with the emperor’s own cupidity, as he enviously watched the high revenues enjoyed by the cities from their trading in cloth and salt. =Fighting and another rebirth for the Swabian League of Cities (1376–1380)= The defeat of the city league by Count Eberhard II of Württemberg in 1372, the murder of the captain of the league, and the breach of his obligations by Charles IV led to the formation of a new league of fourteen Swabian cities on 4 July 1376. These were led by Ulm. The others were Biberach an der Riss, Buchhorn, Isny im Allgäu, Konstanz, Leutkirch im Allgäu, Lindau (Bodensee), Memmingen, Ravensburg, Reutlingen, Rottweil, St. Gallen, Überlingen, and Wangen im Allgäu. The alliance of the fourteen would hold together for four years from 1376. Additionally, in August 1377 these were joined by Dinkelsbühl, an imperial city on the edge of Franconia, to the north-east of the Swabian region. Dinkelsbühl was followed by cities from the Franconian heartland such as Rothenburg ob der Tauber and Windsheim. The emperor refused to recognise the newly revitalised Swabian League, seeing it as a rebellion, and this led to an \\"imperial war\\" against the league. The renewed league triumphed at the Battle of Reutlingen on 14 May 1377 over an army led by Ulrich of Württemberg. Ulrich was the son of Eberhard II of Württemberg, who was an enthusiastic backer of the emperor's confrontational approach to the Swabian League of Cities. The emperor himself now became more conciliatory, however, and on 31 May 1377 he lifted the ban he had imposed on the League and set up an arbitration court, which was rapidly extended over the Rhineland, Bavaria, and Franconia. =1381–1386= The power and extent of the Swabian League peaked during the first half of the 1380s, with the number of member cities reaching 32 by 1385. However, after a couple of decades during which things had begun to stabilize a little after the outbreak of plague that had devastated populations and abruptly distorted economic relationships through most of western Europe during the first half of the 1350s, old tensions were again becoming more apparent. The South German league of cities On 20 March 1381, the Rhenish league of cities (der Rheinischer Städtebund), another alliance of cities in the area, came into being. Its member cities were located west of the core Swabian League members, and included some of the largest and most powerful independent cities on and near to the banks of the Rhine, including Frankfurt, Mainz, Worms, Speyer, and Strasbourg. This alliance came into being to counter the threat of the “Löwenbund”, an association of princes and less nobility. In a further development, on 17 June 1381 the Rhenish league of cities and the Swabian League of Cities came together to create the South German league of cities (der Süddeutscher Städtebund), a military alliance bound by pledges of mutual assistance. The South German league also had additional members such as Basel and Wil. The warlords reacted just six days later with the creation of the Rhenish Alliance of Prince-Electors, and set about obtaining royal recognition of it. In 1381 the League of Cities conducted a war against the Löwenbund in Franconia. Augsburg, Ulm, and Schwäbisch Hall meanwhile undertook a military push into the nobles' territories. =1387–1388= Württemberg nevertheless struck back and, uniting with the forces of Elector Palatine Rupert I and the Nuremberg Burgrave Frederick V of Hohenzollern, finally defeated the league in 1388 at Döffingen. The next year the city league disbanded according to the resolutions of the Reichstag at Eger.

The trail runs south from York Mills Road, east of and roughly parallel to Leslie Street. The city built the trail on the roadbed of a former railway line, known as the Leaside Spur. The trail is situated within the Don Mills neighbourhood of Toronto. None of the trail is within Leaside, although that was the destination of trains that used the former Leaside Spur. The Don Mills Trail is not to be confused with the Lower Don Trail, also within Toronto. Description The trail starts at the intersection of York Mills Road and Scarsdale Road and ends in a dead-end about south of Overland Drive. Most of the trail runs between residential areas while the southern portion is bordered by industrial and commercial properties, following the roadbed of a former railway line. At the north end, just south of the bridge at York Mills Road, the trail runs parallel to the still-active tracks of the Canadian National Railway (CNR) Bala Division. At the south end, the trail stops a short distance from the tracks of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) Belleville Subdivision, which are fenced off from the trail. There are ornamental circles in the pavement where the trail intersects a street or a cross-trail, including circles at Talwood Park, Lawrence Avenue East (north and south side) and Overland Drive. Some of the circles contain two embedded parallel rails as a reminder of the trail's railway legacy. In or near the circles there are ornamental bike parking stands. The circles at Talwood Park and Overland Drive each have park benches and a pair of cyclist barriers to force cross bicycle traffic to ride around the circle. The circles at the Lawrence Avenue crossing have seating walls around parts of each circle's circumference, with one wall of each circle bearing the name of the trail. There are traffic signals where the trail crosses Lawrence Avenue. History =Rail= Warehouse siding once served by the Leaside Spur (2017 photo) The trail uses the roadbed of the Leaside Spur (also known as the Leaside Cutoff and the Oriole Spur), a former railway line that connected Oriole on the CNR Bala Subdivision with Donlands on the CPR Belleville Subdivision. (Oriole is at York Mills Road, and Donlands is about 450 metres north of Eglinton Avenue East.) The Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) built the line originally to access the CPR North Toronto Station. (However, CNoR/CNR passenger service to North Toronto Station never occurred.) The Leaside Spur opened on February 1, 1918; it was long. The CNR purchased the spur in 1918 after the CNoR became financially insolvent. The Leslie Spur provided access to the CNoR's shop complex at Leaside, which included a roundhouse, a large locomotive shop, a passenger coach shop and other buildings. The complex replaced an engine house in the Don Valley at Rosedale that had limited capacity and was vulnerable to flooding. CNoR trains from downtown to Leaside needed to go north through the Don Valley to Oriole then south on the Leaside Spur. The Leaside locomotive shop opened in 1919, and there was a transfer table between it and the passenger coach shop. With the merger of the CNoR into the CNR, the complex became redundant and was closed in the 1930s. The locomotive shop survives today, and is occupied by Longo's Leaside supermarket on Laird Drive. The CNR used the Leaside Spur to interchange freight with the CPR and to serve local industries at Leaside using a small yard there. The CNR once had running rights to switch industries on the north side of the CPR midtown line all the way to the TTC's Hillcrest Complex at Bathurst Street. There also used to be a few sidings serving industries along the spur, including one with much of its track still in place as of 2017. See photo. The CNR abandoned the spur in 1999. In April 2009, the Province of Ontario purchased the Don Branch (running between downtown Toronto and Leaside). GO Transit was considering rerouting its Richmond Hill line trains over the Don Branch and the Leaside Spur in order to avoid the Bala division south of Oriole which is vulnerable to Don River flooding. The idea was dropped when the City of Toronto purchased it for a key link in the bike trail network, now the Don Mills Trail. There was one bridge on the Leaside Spur over Bond Avenue; it took 6 years to construct between 1912 and 1918. The abutments are concrete slabs high. Six beams span the opening, spaced to handle the weight of locomotives and heavily loaded railcars. Sitting on the steel beams were twenty-one 8×8-inch (20×20 cm) railway ties, spaced apart for drainage. The bridge is now used by the Don Mills Trail. =Trail= The City of Toronto purchased the right-of-way of the Leaside Spur in late 2001. By 2010, the City of Toronto was holding public sessions for the design of the trail. Because of its deteriorating condition, the bridge over Bond Avenue was threatened with demolition in 2011. Local residents pushed to give it a heritage designation in order to preserve it. By October 2011, the paving of the trail and the installation of park features were nearing completion, as was the installation of traffic lights where the trail crosses Lawrence Avenue East. An exception was the trail north of Bond Avenue. Scarsdale Road, running roughly parallel to the incomplete portion of the trail, was designated as Toronto Bike Trail 45, for cyclists. On August 2, 2017, the northern part of trail between Bond Avenue and York Mills Road was opened, though that portion of the trail was not fully completed until about October 2016. , the southern end of the trail ends at a dead-end about north of the CPR line. Providing an exit at the southern end to Leslie Street depends on an commercial/industrial landowner agreeing to provide access over private land. As of October 2016, there was no deal to grant such access, after a landowner backed out of a tentative agreement.

This dark blue salt is well known as an early example of a compound featuring quadruple bond between its metal centers. Although the compound has no practical value, its characterization was significant in opening a new field of research into complexes with quadruple bonds. Synthesis and reactions  Soviet chemists first reported K2[Re2Cl8] in 1954,Лидин Р.А., Андреева Л.Л., Молочко В.А. Константы неорганических веществ.(1954)2:161 but it was not until 1964 that Cotton and Harris characterized the compound as featuring a short Re–Re bond, the first of its kind discovered. The results of this classic study subsequently led to new work into other metals capable of forming metal–metal bonds, such as chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, and technetium. A high-yield synthesis of the tetrabutylammonium salt involves treating the perrhenate salt with benzoyl chloride followed by HCl: :2 [(n-C4H9)4N]ReO4 \\\\+ 8 C6H5COCl → [(n-C4H9)4N]2[Re2Cl8] + organic products :Structure of the anion . Octachlorodirhenate(III) is a precursor to other complexes with multiply-bonded rhenium centers as the quadruple bond is quite stable and is often maintained in ligand substitution reactions. For example, upon treatment with concentrated HBr, the complex forms the analogous anion [Re2Br8]2−, which can easily be converted into other dirhenium species. Structure and bonding Sample of (NBu4)2Re2Cl8, illustrating the blue-green [Re2Cl8]2- chromophore . In the [Re2Cl8]2−, the Re–Re bond distance is 2.24 Å, the Re–Re–Cl bond angles are 104°, and the Cl–Re–Cl angles are 87°. The chloride ligands are fully eclipsed. Although this geometry results in repulsive interactions between the chloride ions, this conformation allows for maximum δ–δ overlap between the Re(III) centers, a factor which overrides the unfavorable chloride repulsions. The [Re2Cl8]2− anion has a weak electrophilic character. With the configuration, Re(III) is well suited to engage in quadruple bonding. Electrons are allocated to give the configuration σ2π4δ2, resulting in a bond order of 4 between the rhenium centers. The brilliant color of the [Re2Cl8]2− arises from the δ→δ* electronic transition.

It originally aired on January 2, 2014 on NBC; and was written by Andy Bobrow and directed by Jay Chandrasekhar. Plot Jeff Winger finds himself having difficulty teaching his new class, \\"Fundamentals of Law\\", and finds himself suffering some ridicule from Greendale students, due to his nonchalant attitude, and his demeanor which is more akin to a student than a teacher. He shares an office with Buzz Hickey (Jonathan Banks), who has been teaching for 15 years, and is Annie's Criminology Professor. Abed begins taking a class discussing actor Nicolas Cage, and whether he should be considered a \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" actor. Annie and Jeff begin to fight over Jeff's attitude and unwillingness to take his class seriously. She later enrolls in the class in order to put pressure on him to do a better job. Meanwhile, Jeff and Hickey begin to bond, and Hickey proves to be a very intense individual. It is also revealed that virtually none of Greendale's professors take their jobs seriously. Abed begins to obsess over Nicolas Cage, being unable to determine whether he is a good or bad actor for the class, and he suffers a nervous breakdown in class, inadvertently emulating some of Cage's more \\"over the top\\" performances. He is eventually comforted by Shirley, after discovering the two share a mutual fandom of the Hellraiser movie series. Hickey suggests that Jeff give Annie \\"A-\\" grades on her work, as it will drive a perfectionist like her crazy. He also suggests that teachers invented the \\"minus\\" score for lettered grades as a way to give students they don't like the illusion of a lower score even though the \\"minus\\" mark has no actual meaning. Jeff opts not to after eventually discovering that he enjoys teaching thanks to an in-class fight with Annie where he uses his skills as a lawyer to win the argument, causing his class to suddenly become interested. Hickey gives Annie an \\"A-\\" on one of her criminology projects, causing her to become frustrated and decide to drop Jeff's class, so she can devote more time to Hickey's. Jeff confronts Hickey about this fact, and Hickey reveals he did it to try to help keep Annie off of Jeff's back in class. Jeff tells Annie that the \\"minus\\" is a meaningless grade by teachers who don't like their students, causing her to create a small riot on campus. Jeff attempts to stop the riot with a speech, only for the students to further turn on him. Later, in order to make up for the riot, Dean Pelton advises Jeff to start a student-teacher \\"Save Greendale\\" alliance, inspired by the fictitious \\"Save Greendale\\" cause Jeff created for a ruse in the previous episode. Professor Hickey also joins, as do the other members of the study group. Their first order of business is to ban Dean Pelton from all meetings. Production This is the first episode to feature an appearance by recurring guest star Jonathan Banks. It also features the return of Kevin Corrigan as Professor Sean Garrity.

The first two sonatas were written during her study with Shostakovich, but retain a unique voice. According to Alex Ross, the works are evocative of the Rosicrucian mystical period of Satie. The following two were composed less than a decade later and involve more expressive dynamic markings and contrasts. The final two sonatas, written nearly thirty years after the Fourth Sonata, are perhaps the most shocking and violent expressions within her musical output. Sonata No. 1 Sonata No. 1 (1947) is in four movements, usually taking about ten minutes to perform. As a whole, the work showcases her use of two-part counterpoint, repeated use of single-note values, and economical intensity of musical material. Sonata No. 2 Sonata No. 2 in two parts (1949) features similar melodic material in its two movements that are expressed quite differently. The tempo relationships between the movements (quarter=80 vs. quarter=92) allows the movements to take different courses. The second movement features an extended climax, which utilizes repeated quarter notes and, over the course of three to four minutes, grows to a ffff dynamic. Despite this procession of quarter notes, the music retains Ustvolskaya's use of counterpoint, with each voice retaining its clarity. Sonata No. 3 Sonata No. 3 (1952) is Ustvolskaya's longest out of the six. The work is based on three unresolved melodies, all presented within the first four minutes. According to Thom Jurek, the melodies \\"hang there, like prayers extended in supplication and as yet unanswered. This sonata is ever waiting upon the sweep of divine intervention yet continues dutifully, persistently in its sweetness as if not convinced it's already not too late. It engages silence at its end, as the last statement of mystery, without wonder or expectation, its part in the spiritual equation complete.\\" The one-movement work has many tempo indications, but retains a brutal and obsessive quarter- note drive. Sonata No. 4 Sonata No. 4 in four parts (1957) contains elements of Satie, Shostakovich, even Rachmaninov. Its architectural clarity of form is mixed with stark contrasts. The first movement opens with three bell-like chords and progresses through an withdrawn, extended pp passage. The fourth movement offers stand-alone polytonal phrases and intervals whose architecture dictates its form. Sonata No. 5 The Fifth Sonata was composed 29 years after the Fourth and is in ten parts, performed without a break. As a whole, the sonata has an obsessive D4 that allows for cohesion of all the parts. Like the Sixth sonata, this work features chord clusters and violent dynamic contrasts – Alex Ross even commenting that, \\"she has colonized the higher end of the dynamic spectrum much as Morton Feldman took possession of the lower.\\" The music also features an economical use of thematic material – mostly quarter notes in two-part counterpoint at a moderately slow tempo.Ustvolskaya, Galina. Klavierwerke II : Sonaten 4–6. Hamburg : Sikorski, 1996. Musical score. Sonata No. 6 Sonata No. 6 of 1988 is a physically violent work which utilizes thick chord clusters throughout. Because of its ffff clusters, musicologist Maria Cizmic explains, \\"It opens up a performance space in which a pianist feels pain, foregrounding the concrete bodily acts and sensations of suffering at a time when the violence of the USSR's past continued to be contested.\\" Its first tempo indication, Expressivissimo, is one indication of its hyper-expressionality. Even through such dissonance, a number of melodies can be heard, usually the top note of each cluster. Before the final restatement of the first theme, a series of six chords, played as softly and chorale-like as possible, provides a moment of stillness.

The general distinguishing factors for the machines have included sturdy metal construction, factory assembly, and low price. All four of the existing Solidoodles have a protective steel shell, are assembled, and are priced under $1000. Like most consumer printers, the Solidoodle is compatible with both acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and polylactic acid (PLA). =Solidoodle 1= The Solidoodle 1 was launched at Maker Faire 2011. The machine was 4x4x4 inch, and featured a steel enclosure. Unlike contemporary Solidoodles, the Solidoodle 1 features a geared drive mechanism. The Solidoodle 1 was discontinued from the Solidoodle online store as of the release of the Solidoodle 2 in 2012. Because of an early program to provide inexpensive upgrades from the Solidoodle 1 to the Solidoodle 2 for early adopters, few Solidoodle 1's remain in the field, and the printer has become a bit of a rarity in 3D printing collections. =Solidoodle 2= The Solidoodle 2 was launched at New York Tech day, winning first prize. The printer was an incremental improvement over the Solidoodle 1, with a larger build area (6x6x6 inch), and a variety of optional upgrades including a heated bed (pro model) and a case (expert model.) =Solidoodle 3= The Solidoodle 3 was launched on November 16, 2012 to be sold for Black Friday. The Solidoodle 3 featured a larger build area (8x8x8 inch) and improvements to the heating system for the bed. Updates Responding to customer feedback, Solidoodle released incremental updates to the Solidoodle 3 over the first year of its operation. Solidoodle released updates to the carriage system, build plate, power supply, build platform, and mother board. =Solidoodle 4= The Solidoodle 4 was launched on November 22, 2013. The Solidoodle 4 improved on the Solidoodle 3 by adding a protective outer shell.

While most of the parts of the Solidoodle 2, and 3 printers can be found in the online store, Solidoodle does not offer kits. =Modding community= Due to the machine's relatively low price, and subsequent popularity, all of the Solidoodle printers to date have enjoyed an active modding community, with blogs like Solidoodle Tips leading the way. Solidoodle modifications typically strive to enhance the functionality of the printer in order to achieve the performance of more expensive printers, taking advantage of the machine's relatively sturdy steel gantry system. Common modifications include hot-end and extruder replacements, improved carriage systems, bowden style extrusion systems, build plate replacements, and thread ball screws. Installing a cooling fan at the point of extrusion is a popular modification. This drastically improves the accuracy of prints by allowing the contours to cool rapidly and evenly. This minimises any distortion created by forms that cool unevenly and may buckle during printing. This buckling is persistent in forms like bowls, where the cantilever edge of each layer cools faster than the inside edge of the layer which is kept warmer by its contact with the previous layer. The uneven cooling sees the outside edges shrink inwards and up. As more layers of the print proceed, the extruder can be seen to be pushing the print around with each new layer as the problem of contours leaning inwards and upwards multiplies the distortion. The use of a fan however reduces the binding of the layers with less merging of the surfaces. =Service= Solidoodle offers free tech support to all of their users, and maintains learning materials on their website for those interested in learning 3D printing. =Shutdown= On March 28, 2016 Solidoodle shutdown operations laying off all 70 employees.

As a two-year-old in 1982, he created an enormous impression by winning the Acomb Stakes and Champagne Stakes by wide margins and was regarded as a potentially great racehorse. His very poor run when odds-on favourite for the Dewhurst Stakes was believed by many, including his trainer, to have been the result of doping. The horse remained in training for two more seasons but never fulfilled his early promise. He made little impact as a breeding stallion and died in 1996. Background Gorytus was a bay horse with a small white star bred in Virginia by his owner, Alice Mills' Hickory Tree Farm. He was an exceptionally good-looking Thoroughbred, being described by the independent Timeform organisation as being \\"beautifully- proportioned, combining size, strength and quality\\" with \\"splendid limbs\\" and \\"a noble head\\". He was named after the Latin transliteration of the Greek γωρυτός, the name of a bow-case for a short recurve, or Scythian, bow. Gorytus was sired by Nijinsky, the Canadian-bred winner of the English Triple Crown in 1970 who went on to become an important stallion, siring horses such as Ferdinand, Lammtarra, Sky Classic and Shahrastani. His dam Glad Rags was an Irish-bred mare who won the 1000 Guineas in 1966 and went on to become an influential broodmare: her descendants include Union Rags, the winner of the 2012 Belmont Stakes, and Declaration of War, winner of the Queen Anne Stakes and International Stakes in 2013. Mills sent the colt to race in Europe where he was trained by Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire. He was ridden in his British races by the Scottish jockey Willie Carson. Racing career =1982: two-year-old season= Gorytus began his racing career at York Racecourse in August in the Acomb Stakes a race which Dick Hern had previously used to introduce horses such as Bustino and Height of Fashion. He started the 5/1 second favourite behind Salieri, an unbeaten colt who was rumoured to the best two-year-old in Henry Cecil's Warren Place stable. Salieri led from the start but Carson brought Gorytus forward to join him early in the straight. In the final quarter mile Gorytus took the lead and then accelerated away to win easily by seven lengths. His winning time of 1:23.73 broke the track record by over a second. A month later, the colt was moved up in class for the Group Two Champagne Stakes over seven furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. He started the 8/13 favourite against a field which included All Systems Go, the winner of the Seaton Delaval Stakes and Lanson Champagne Stakes and On Stage the runner- up in the July Stakes and Prix Morny. Carson tracked the leaders before moving Gorytus into the lead two furlongs from the finish. In the closing stages he stretched away from the field, despite Carson never resorting to the whip, and won by five lengths from the Guy Harwood-trained Proclaim. When asked about the colt's targets after the Champagne Stakes, Hern replied \\"the Dewhurst, the 2000 Guineas and the Derby\\". Bookmakers responded by making Gorytus 4/1 favourite for the Guineas and 5/1 favourite for the Derby. Gorytus' final race of the season was the Group One Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 15 October, in which he was matched against the Middle Park Stakes winner Diesis. Gorytus started the 1/2 favourite with Diesis on 2/1, while the other two runners, Gordian and Tough Commander started at odds of 33/1 and 200/1 respectively. Carson settled Gorytus in third place behind the two outsiders, with Lester Piggott restraining Diesis in last place. The favourite appeared to be going well until half way but then began to struggle and quickly dropped out of contention with Carson looking down at the horse's legs as if he had sustained an injury. Diesis won easily by five lengths, with Gorytus finishing last of the four runners, thirty lengths behind the third-placed Tough Commander. Despite returning from the race in a distressed state, the colt showed no sign of injury and made a full recovery within twenty-four hours. This led to a great deal of rumour and speculation as observers attempted to explain the performance. Several horses in the Hern stable had been suffering from a respiratory infection in October and it was suggested that Gorytus may have been a sick horse on the day of the race. Hern, however, denied this, pointing out that the horse had been carefully monitored and tested in the build-up to the Dewhurst and had shown no sign of illness. Carson reported that the horse might have \\"swallowed his tongue\\", but this was not supported by veterinary examination: the jockey later suggested that the horse's temperament was at fault, saying that \\"he took the mickey out of us after his first two races. If I had my time again I'd ride him differently\\". The most popular theory was that Gorytus had been \\"got at\\" or \\"nobbled\\": that is to say that a substance had been deliberately administered to the colt to prevent him from winning. Richard Baerlein, writing in The Guardian reported that the horse had been seen defecating with abnormal frequency before the race and suggested that Gorytus had been doped with croton oil, a substance used as a laxative for elephants. This would, however, would not be consistent with Hern's statement that the colt lost only ten pounds during the race. Hern had been congratulated by Phil Bull at Ayr Racecourse a week after Gorytus's win at Doncaster, and Bull had warned Hern that his biggest problem would be security, as some bookmakers had laid the horse to lose so much in the 2,000 Guineas that they could not afford to pay if he won the race. The tabloid Daily Star presented the theory that the colt had been affected by exposure to an irritant, administered in an aerosol spray as he was led round the pre-race paddock. Carson however, rejected this idea by saying that no-one had come close enough to the horse to carry out this type of attack. If a substance was administered to the horse, it was not one detectable by testing procedures at the time: the post-race drug test carried out by the Jockey Club produced a negative result. =1983: three-year-old season= Gorytus made his first appearance as a three-year-old in the 2000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course on 30 April. He looked extremely impressive in the paddock and was made second favourite in the betting at odds of 7/2 in a field of sixteen runners. He briefly disputed the lead before fading into fifth place behind Lomond, Tolomeo, Muscatite and Kuwait Tower. Plans to run the colt in the Derby were abandoned because of the extremely soft ground and he was ruled out of a run in the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot after developing a respiratory infection. After further training problems, he eventually reappeared in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup on 16 August at York. Starting the 7/2 second favourite, he ran well for much of the race before finishing fourth behind Caerleon, Hot Touch and John French, beaten a total of two lengths. Eleven days later, Gorytus started the 6/4 favourite for the Waterford Crystal Mile at Goodwood Racecourse, where he was expected to be favoured by the firmer ground. After being restrained by Carson in the early stages he made some progress early in the straight but quickly weakened and finished fifth of the six runners behind Montekin. =1984: four-year-old season= In 1984, Gorytus was transferred to the United States where he was trained by Woody Stephens. On 21 January he finished second in the Royal Palm Handicap at Hialeah Park. Two weeks later he finished fourth behind Four Bases in the Bougainvillea Handicap at the same track. After his first race Stephens questioned the horse's attitude, saying that \\"he didn't look very genuine\\". Assessment At the end of the 1982 season, the independent Timeform organisation gave Gorytus a rating of 132, making him their second-best two- year-old of the season behind Diesis (133). In the official International Classification he was ranked third behind Diesis and the French colt Saint Cyrien. As a three-year-old he was awarded a rating of 123 by Timeform while in the International Classification he was rated thirteen pounds inferior to the top-rated three-year-old Shareef Dancer. Stud record Gorytus returned from Europe to stand as a breeding stallion at the Coolmore Stud in Ireland in 1985 before being exported to Japan three years later. He was not a successful sire, with the best of his offspring being the Group Three winners La Monalisa (Prix Penelope), Piani di Caiano (Premio Pisa), Tao (Furstenberg-Rennen) and Gouriev (Horris Hill Stakes). He was also the damsire of the outstanding hurdler Inglis Drever. Gorytus died in Japan on 18 July 1996 at the age of sixteen.

U.S. Senator Herman Talmadge and his then-administrative assistant, Daniel Minchew, began diverting campaign funds to Talmadge's personal use in 1973. Transfers of cash usually occurred when Minchew withdrew funds from campaign bank accounts and delivered the cash to Talmadge in his Senate office. On only a single occasion did Minchew deliver cash elsewhere, and that occurred at The Embassy Row Hotel in November 1974 after Talmadge gave a speech there.Minchew, Daniel.

In September 1981, a consortium of 20 wealthy Republican Party (GOP) donors purchased The Embassy Row for $14 million with a goal of making it a high-end luxury hotel catering specifically to GOP politicians, donors, and others.Newell, David. \\"A Republican Setback in Hotelkeeping.\\" New York Times. April 25, 1982. Accessed 2013-11-21. Singer, Mark. Funny Money. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2004, p. 108; Teeley, Sandra Evans. \\"20 Republicans Buy Embassy Row Hotel.\\" Washington Post. September 26, 1981. The consortium consisted mostly of individuals involved in the Oklahoma oil drilling and petroleum refining business, including J.D. Allen, Robert A. Hefner III, Steve Jernigan, Virgil Tilly, and Lew O. Ward.Fossett, Judy. \\"Strike Pits Haves, Have-Nots.\\" Daily Oklahoman. April 25, 1982. The consortium was led by G. Bradford Cook and Joe M. Rogers, a former Republican National Committee Finance Committee chairman. The consortium intended to give the hotel a new name, Hotel Trianon, and give it a $3 million French Baroque renovation. The renovation was delayed for two reasons. First, occupancy rates at the hotel dropped to lows not seen since World War II. Second, the hotel suffered a debilitating strike. The hotel withdrew from the Hotel Association of Washington, D.C.'s master contract in October 1981, a move which angered the association and signalled management's intent to negotiate a separate contract. The hotel staff union, Local 25 HERE, struck on November 17\\"HERE Local 25, Embassy Row Settle Eight-Month Strike.\\" Retail/Services Labor Report. July 19, 1982, p. 165. when the hotel owners demanded 90 days to review all staff and fire whomever they chose without cause, due process, or notice. Management also sought cuts in pension and health care benefits. Occupancy rates dropped to just 50 percent, 20 percent lower than the city- wide average and well below the break-even point. Third, financing for the hotel purchase and renovation came under fire by labor unions and others in Tennessee. The hotel was purchased with a $9.8 million loan from Security Federal Savings and Loan in Nashville. The single loan represented 60 percent of the commercial loan business of the savings and loan association (S&L;) and its only out-of-state loan—which led to questions about whether undue influence was applied to the S&L; to make the loan, and whether it imperiled the S&L;'s financial stability. The consortium said that the strike had delayed the renovation two months and the hotel would likely lose $1.5 million in 1982, but that nevertheless the renovation would proceed. The renovation did not proceed, and the strike continued. Losses were so high that the consortium now lacked the means to finance the upgrades. Lincoln Hotels, a subsidiary of Lincoln Property Company, purchased a 10 percent interest in The Embassy Row Hotel for an undisclosed sum in May 1982. \\"Lincoln Hotels New Investor, Manager for Embassy Row.\\" Washington Post. May 3, 1982. The company also took over management of the property, and said it would renovate the structure in an attempt to turn The Embassy Row into a five-star hotel. Lincoln Hotels quickly negotiated an end to the strike. The eight-month strike ended on July 12, 1982, when the Embassy Row Hotel signed a new contract with Local 25. The Republican-led consortium won nothing: The new agreement was nearly identical to the hotel association's master contract (with very minor changes). =1983 renovation= The hotel finally underwent a $5 million renovation in 1983 to turn it into a luxury hotel. The newly renovated hotel was rededicated in late April 1983.Gamarekian, Barbara. \\"New Hotels Emphasize the Amenities.\\" New York Times. May 6, 1983.

August 1984, p. 66. Many of the hotel's small rooms were enlarged and 28 suites created.Eisen, Jack. \\"A New Embassy Row Hotel.\\" Washington Post. April 29, 1983. Other changes included offering a free, full breakfast to all guests, offering luxury bath and toilet items, putting television sets into armoires rather than hanging them from brackets on the walls, and adding an herb garden on the roof for the restaurant's use. Le Consulat was closed, and a new restaurant named La Reserve opened with a lower-priced menu.Richman, Phyllis C. \\"La Reserve In the Embassy Row Hotel.\\" Washington Post. July 10, 1983. The Embassy Row Hotel received a four-star rating after the renovation.Burgess, John. \\"McGovern Turns Hotelier.\\" Washington Post. October 7, 1988. A \\"royal/presidential\\" suite was added to the top floor by combining several rooms.

That same year, the Federal City Club (a private club for wealthy men and women) leased space within the hotel while it searched for a permanent home.\\"Federal City Club Finds Home at Embassy Row.\\" Washington Post. February 27, 1984. The renovated hotel proved popular with the rich and famous. The following year saw New York City real estate executive Jerome Zipkin, department store heiress Betsy Bloomingdale, cosmetics and perfume magnate Estée Lauder, and actress Mary Martin stay at the hotel.Conroy, Sarah Booth. \\"The Sweet Inaugural Suites.\\" Washington Post. January 9, 1985. The hotel also proved popular for scandals. The Iran–Contra affair broke open on November 25, 1986, when the Reagan administration disclosed that funds generated by arms sales to Iran had been used to support rebels in Nicaragua fighting the communist regime of Daniel Ortega. The arms sales violated a U.S. embargo on sales to Iran, and the diversion of funds violated federal law barring use of federal funds to support the rebels (or contras). Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North was fired from the National Security Council the same day for orchestrating the arms sales and funds diversion. On November 24, North met for several hours with fellow conspirators Richard Secord, a retired Air Force Major General; Albert Hakim, an Iranian American businessman; and Thomas C. Green, a prominent D.C. criminal attorney who claimed to be legal counsel for North, Secord and Hakim. Hours after being fired on November 25, North, Green, and Secord met for several hours at the Embassy Row Hotel.Fritz, Sara and Tumulty, Karen. \\"2 Meetings of Key Figures Cited.\\" Los Angeles Times. June 15, 1987. After the meeting, North and Green returned to North's office in the Old Executive Office Building and assisted North's secretary, Fawn Hall, in smuggling documents smuggling classified documents out of the building.Morgan, Dan and Pincus, Walter. \\"Reagan Says No 'Smoking Gun' Exists in Scandal.\\" Washington Post. June 17, 1987. The Los Angeles Times reported that congressional investigators and legal experts both agreed that the conspiracy to attempt to cover up the Iran-Contra Affair began at these two meetings. But still the hotel did not do good business. In 1985, occupancy rates fell to 50 percent. Director of Marketing Maureen Curry was forced to lower rates and seek motorcoach tours to fill rooms. Although occupancy rose to 60 percent, it was still not breaking even.Novack, Janet. \\"Epidemic Grand Luxe.\\" Forbes. November 3, 1986. While the hotel did excellent business during the workweek, it was \\"dead empty\\" on weekends (according to staff).Horwitz, Sari. \\"Hotels Use Freebies to Attract Guests.\\" Washington Post. March 2, 1986. =Block Hotel Corp. and bankruptcy= Block Hotel Corp. purchased The Embassy Row Hotel in September 1988 for an undisclosed sum. The purchase included several individual investors, among whom was former U.S. Senator George McGovern. Block Hotel said it intended to make further renovations to the structure. Block Hotel and the investors established a holding company, Embassy Row Hotel Investors, to take title to the property.Manigault, Pierre and Thomason, Robert. \\"Bankruptcy Filings.\\" Washington Post. July 6, 1992. Just two months later, in November 1988, the land beneath the hotel was sold. The land belonged to Travelers Corp. (a large insurance company), which sold it to Allan J. Riley, president of Riley Real Estate Investments. The property exchanged hands for an undisclosed sum. The Washington Post reported that the hotel paid $74,076 per month in 1988 to use the land.\\"N.Y. Investor Cites 'Superb Location,' Buys Land Under Embassy Row Hotel.\\" Washington Post.

Among the changes wrought by the renovation was the relocation of the restaurant from the first floor to the basement. It was renamed International Marketplace, its long-time chef left, and it began serving more casual fare.Fisher, Eric. \\"International Marketplace Offers Ambitious But Disappointing Fare.\\" Washington Times. January 25, 1999. CapStar later split into two companies, Meristar Hospitality Corp. and Meristar Hotels and Resorts (which itself underwent a name change to Interstate Hotels & Resorts). Hilton's management of the hotel rapidly improved its finances. In 2004, the hotel ranked 21st on the list of top-performing hotels, according to Lodging Hospitality magazine (an industry trade journal). In 2005, it was ranked 15th, with total sales of $13.1 million a year and sales per room of $67,875 a year. Its average occupancy rate now reached 83 percent.\\"LH's Top Performers.'

Willow Hotels had trouble covering its debt service payments, however, after occupancy rates at the hotel fell significantly lower during the 2008-2011 recession. Occupancy plunged to just 64 percent in 2009, although it rebounded to 85.6 percent by the first quarter of 2011. This was enough, however, to cover only about 91 percent of the debt payments, and Willow Hotels was forced to dip into its reserves to cover the balance. Willow Hotels hired an outside firm, LNR Partners, in 2011 to service the debt while it negotiated with lenders to extend the maturity date for the loann prior to any renovation or rebranding. Willow also sought to rebrand and reposition the hotel, and hired an outside firm to find a potential buyer.Cole, Marine. \\"Quick Deal Seen for Shoreham and 4 Other Hotels.\\" Crain's New York Business.

After 18 months of picketing and tough negotiations, a new contract was reached in mid April. The contract, which ran 5.5 years, included a wage increase, a 50 percent employer contribution to the pension fund, a penalties for employers to pay workers late. The master contract affected all 22 of the Hotel Association's members, which included some of the biggest hotels in the area.Douglas, Danielle. \\"Union Workers at Hotels Get a New Labor Contract.\\" Washington Post. April 30, 2012. On November 19, 2013, Lowe Enterprises purchased the Embassy Row Hotel from Willow Hotels for an undisclosed price. Also investing the hotel were The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America and Allstate Insurance Co. Lowe Enterprises said it would convert the Embassy Row into an independent boutique hotel, and assigned a subsidiary, Destination Hotels & Resorts, to manage the property. Lowe's said it intended to make extensive upgrades to guest rooms and public areas (including the lobby). Lowe's began a year-long, $15 million renovation in March 2014. Refurbishment began with the two-level rooftop pool, which received a new lounge area, cooking grills, and furniture. Company officials said phase two of the renovation would occur in November 2014, when the hotel's 231 rooms and its common areas will be refurbished with new electronics, furnishings, and wallpaper. The second phase will also relocate the main lobby from the below-ground level to the first floor. Renovation of the first floor will also include the construction of a bar and quick-serve restaurant/coffee bar (which will serve take-away as well as plated items). The main entrance will be replaced in order to make the restaurant more accessible to non-guests. In addition to relocating the lobby, the below- ground meeting spaces on the lower level will also be renovated. Company officials said the construction and renovation should be complete by March 2015, after which room price increases are likely to be implemented.Cooper, Rachel. \\"Embassy Row Hotel Starts Renovation: First the Roof, Then the Rest.\\" Washington Business Journal. April 2, 2014. Accessed 2014-04-02. The renovated rooftop pool opened the first week of July 2014. The area, which cost $500,000 to renovate, featured teak furniture, a food kiosk, and a bar. The hotel sold 50 pool season passes to the public at $500 each, while a handful of day passes were available to the public for $25 each. Phase two of the renovation began on schedule in November 2014. The quick-serve restaurant had been altered slightly to be a grab-and-go food outlet, where patrons order food from their rooms and pick it up from the lobby restaurant. The coffee shop and bar were now a single space. The space now was intended to served as a café during the day, and a bar and lounge for guests and neighborhood residents at night. Destination Hotels said the new restaurant would be called Station Kitchen & Cocktails. A March 2015 completion date was still anticipated. Description The Embassy Row Hotel was constructed in the Modernist architectural style. Its exterior is of white brick. , the Embassy Row Hotel had of banquet and meeting room space (up from in 1996), a rooftop swimming pool, a 110-space underground parking garage, and a fitness center. Originally, guests entered the hotel beneath a spartan brown metal and glass canopy and were confront by a set of narrow steps. One set of steps led down to the more luxurious and open lobby, while the other led upstairs to the Le Consulat restaurant. The hotel tried to change the color of its awning from brown to blue in 1978, but its request was turned down because the hotel lies within the boundaries of the Dupont Circle Historic District.Bowman, LaBarbara. \\"Paying the Historic Price.\\" Washington Post. February 5, 1979. The hotel originally had 224 rooms, but sources have since reported that it has 224 (1975),Hodge, Paul. \\"Newest Big Hotel Topped Off Here.\\" Washington Post.

Le Consulat was rated one of the best restaurants in the city when it opened, although changes in management and chefs led to a significant decline in its food and service by 1972.Dresden, Donald. \\"Le Consulat: A Disappointing Return to a Recherche Site.\\" Washington Post.

Early life and education Greenquist was born on April 3, 1910 in Florence, Wisconsin. He graduated from Racine High School in Racine, Wisconsin before attending the University of Kentucky. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1936. Career Greenquist worked as a spot welder assistant with the J. I. Case Company, the Massey- Harris Company, and Modine Manufacturing. After graduating from law school, Greenquist entered a law partnership with Francis Wendt, who would later become Chairman of the Racine City Council. In 1938, Wendt and Greenquist entered Progressive politics, managing the campaign of city council candidate Casimir Zielkowski. Zielkowski won his election, and, that fall, Greenquist ran for the Wisconsin Senate in the 21st district. Greenquist won the Progressive Party's nomination in the September primary election, and faced incumbent Democrat Joseph Clancy and Republican challenger Fred Ahlgrimm in the general election. Greenquist won the election and represented Racine County in the Wisconsin Senate for the next four years. As a senator, Greenquist served on the Committee for State and Local Government. In 1941, after the death of Congressman Stephen Bolles, Greenquist ran in the special election to replace him in the 1st Congressional District, but was not successful. He did not seek re-election in 1942 and instead entered the United States Navy Reserve for service in World War II. He attended officer training in Gulfport, Mississippi, and was then assigned to the Liberty ship Ralph A. Cram, journeying from Brooklyn to Europe, then to the South Pacific. After the war, Greenquist was appointed City Attorney of Racine and remained in that role until 1949. He remained active as an attorney and activist. In 1957, he successfully argued the case of Maier v. Racine County before the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which found that the county government did not have the authority to set a legal drinking age. The case became a frequently-cited precedent which limited the powers of county boards. In 1962, Governor John W. Reynolds appointed Greenquist to the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System. He was elected President of the Board of Regents in June of 1967.

The language provides syntax for templates and prepared SQL-statements. P* programs are scripts which are run by the P* interpreter.  Syntax  The syntax is inspired from other C-family languages. Program Blocks starts with the open curly bracket \`{\` and ends with the close curly bracket \`}\`. = Scenes and templates = The code of a P* program is placed into scenes , and the HTML markup is typically placed inside templates. A scene is a special type of function which does not take arguments. All programs must provide exactly one scene called 'main', which is the first to run by the interpreter. A small P* web page, where the code for the program sits inside the scene called 'main' and the HTML markup is put inside a template, can look like this: HTML_TEMPLATE body { {@text} } SCENE main { string text = \\"Hello World!\\"; #CONTENT_TYPE text/html; #HTML_TEMPLATE body; } When scenes and templates in P* are called, the callee inherits all variables which is available from where the call is made.

In college, he was an All-American at Boston University in 2011–12, the same year he was named the America East Conference Player of the Year. Amateur career Partin played high school basketball at Raleigh, North Carolina's Jesse O. Sanderson High School before one additional year at Charis Prep in Wilson, North Carolina. In his final season at Sanderson, he averaged 23.8 points, 4.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists per game while leading the team to a 34–8 overall record. He was named second team all-state. After his fifth prep year at Charis in 2006–07, Partin went on to play for La Salle University. He did not fare particularly well; he averaged 2.0 points, 1.0 rebounds and 0.3 assists per game his freshman season, and 4.6, 0.9 and 0.7, respectively, during his sophomore campaign. He decided to transfer to Boston University (BU) but had to sit out the 2009–10 season due to NCAA eligibility rules. Between 2010 and 2012, Partin played for the BU Terriers. In two seasons with the team he scored 1,130 points, becoming just the sixth player in school history to amass more than 1,000 points in only two years. He led the team in scoring both seasons and was also a two-time First Team All- America East Conference selection. As a junior, Partin guided the Terriers to the America East Tournament championship and an automatic bid in the 2011 NCAA Tournament. During his senior year, the Terriers finished third in the conference and with an overall record of just 16–16, thus missing out on a postseason tournament bid. He was named the America East Conference Player of the Year, however, after being deemed the best player in the league as decided upon by America East's head coaches. He was also tabbed as an honorable mention All-American by the Associated Press. Professional career After going undrafted in the 2012 NBA draft, Partin was selected in the 2012 NBA Development League Draft. The Fort Wayne Mad Ants chose him as the first pick in the fourth round (49th overall). Partin then played the 2012–13 NBA Development League season with the Mad Ants.

The northbound span opened May 5, 2012, and on August 2, 2012, southbound traffic moved to that span as well. A southbound span of the same bridge was completed in October 2012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. The pair of bridges replaces twin spans that carried I-85/US 52 from 1957 to 2012, which were separated by less than . Adjacent are two Warren deck trusses carrying the North Carolina Railroad and Norfolk Southern, one bridge carrying US 29/US 70/NC 150, and the historic concrete arch Wil-Cox Bridge. History The original Interstate 85 Yadkin River Bridge, twin spans completed in 1957 and closed August 2, 2012, carried four lanes of Interstate 85 (two in each direction). The bridge was not only a bottleneck for traffic moving between Charlotte and Greensboro (and between the larger metropolitan areas of Atlanta and Washington, D.C./Baltimore); it was also structurally deficient and in need of replacement. In terms of cost, national importance, and imminent structural failure, it became the highest-profile construction project in North Carolina. In the 1940s, plans began for an Interstate Highway System. North Carolina's State Highway Commission built several limited access roads using equal funding from the federal government and from the state. One planned road was the Salisbury bypass, long with a $1 million twin-span bridge over the Yadkin River. Construction on the bridge started in 1955 (this date is shown on a plaque, and most sources have used the date), but the lanes were not as wide as federal standards required, and the road had a sharp curve north of the bridge. Both of these characteristics saved money. The Federal- Aid Highway Act of 1956 provided for 90 percent federal funding of highways that would become part of the Interstate Highway System, and the N.C. Highway Commission used the funds to build the rest of the highway, which opened as I-85 in 1958. The bridge, finished a year earlier, was \\"grandfathered\\" despite not meeting standards. As of 1984, I-85 was relocated and widened to six lanes starting several miles north of the Yadkin River. Plans were made for widening to eight lanes around Salisbury. After the September 11 attacks, the I-85 bridge was regarded as a potential target for terrorists due to its status as a vital link for the region and even the East Coast.Mark Wineka and Frank DeLoache, \\"Security also a concern on East Coast 's main artery,\\" Salisbury Post, 2007-03-12. The project to build a wider, safer replacement bridge was expected to cost $147 million, with right-of-way acquisition in the years 2003 through 2005 and construction starting by 2007 or 2008.Mark Wineka, \\"Road projects piling up for Salisbury area,\\" Salisbury Post, 2001-09-28. In 2005, the state prepared to ask for bids, but concerns about damage to the Trading Ford Native American cultural site delayed the project two years. With less funding from both the state and federal governments available, the state considered and eventually rejected tolls. After many more delays, the state government asked for federal funding but only received $10 million in TIGER money in 2010. At that time, the bridge carried over 70,000 vehicles every day. The funding for the $180 million design-build project, to be completed in 2013, came from the $10 million from TIGER, $20 million from the state's Transportation Improvement Program, and GARVEE bonds to be repaid over 12 years. The DOT announced April 30 that Flatiron-Lane would build the new I-85 bridge, a replacement bridge for the U.S. 29-70 northbound traffic, bridges taking I-85 over the railroad's main line and a spur line, and redesign one interchange and remove another, in addition to widening and relocating three miles of I-85, for a total cost of $136 million, $44 million less than expected. The state and federal departments of transportation approved the plan July 6. On September 29, 2010, state and local officials held a groundbreaking ceremony on the Davidson County side of the project. Work on the project was scheduled to start the next day. By October 9, 20 acres had been cleared after approximately a week. To build the actual bridge, crews spent five months building a half-mile long, 38-foot wide temporary steel bridge for workers and equipment. This bridge remained in place from July 2011 until October 2012, had to support as many as six 230-ton cranes at a time. On May 11, 2011, the State House passed legislation to call the I-85 bridge the Yadkin River Veterans Memorial Bridge. The northbound bridge's foundation was complete by December 2011, with traffic scheduled to move to that bridge by the end of March 2012. The northbound bridge opened to traffic at 1:15 A.M. May 5, 2012, and southbound traffic moved to lanes on the same bridge August 2 as the old twin spans closed. Demolition work on the old bridges was under way by February 2013 and scheduled to be finished by April. While the target date for the southbound bridge was April 2013, it was later scheduled to open March 9. An official dedication marking the bridge's completion and naming was held November 8, 2013.

It includes summer beach bungalows near the oceanfront of Far Rockaway. They are smaller than the usual domestic bungalows of the 1920s. They were built in 1921 using pattern book designs incorporating uniform facades, compact interiors, integrated porches and exposed rafters. Their architect, Henry Hohauser, became better known in the 1930s as a designer of Art Deco hotels in Miami Beach. The district was hit by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, but survived without major damage. The district is located along Beach 24th, 25th, and 26th Streets. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Looking east from Beach 48th Street at location of former bungalows destroyed for development that didn't happen. This picture shows the barrenness of the developer's vision for Far Rockaway; whereas Richard George and the BBPA have succeeded in preserving their historic bungalows between Beach 24th-27th Streets History The neighborhood's heyday as a resort community ended about 1950. The families that used the nearby Long Island Rail Road to get to the area each summer began to vacation elsewhere as travel by automobile became more accessible to many people. The popularity of the area also suffered after the railroad abandoned the Rockaway Beach Branch in 1950, making travel to the Rockaway Peninsula far less convenient to people from other parts of New York City. Much of the housing in the area was converted into year-round housing for low- income residents, and some of the bungalows were used as public housing. The urban renewal programs instituted by Robert Moses in the 1950s and '60s contributed to the year round residency and eventual decline of Far Rockaway.Parsons, Estelle, Jennifer Callahan, et al. 2010. The bungalows of Rockaway small houses and big dreams on Gotham's shore. New York, NY: Jennifer Callahan and Elizabeth Logan Harris. The closing of the primary rail bridge after a fire in 1950, and the migration of families to other beaches also contributed to changes in the community. The urban renewal also saw the rise of condos and housing projects in the area, and many low income residents of Manhattan were re-located to Far Rockaway, with some going to the poorly maintained bungalows, which were not built for winters. Years of neglect and disinvestment gave way to decline causing many bungalows to be designated slums. By the 1980s, many of the bungalows had been razed, and crime and poverty were on the rise. Only about 100 bungalows remain. The Beachside Bungalow Preservation Association (BBPA) was formed in September 1984 by Betzie Parker White, Roger White, and Carole Lewis. Betzie White was the head, or chairman, of the BBPA and established it as a non-profit 501(c)3 in June 1986. Richard George became a board member in 1985, and chairman around 1990.Creator's Sketch, The Beachside Bungalow Preservation Association of Far Rockaway, Inc. Records, Archives at Queens Library In 1990, the association set up an office and hired a staff to organize community programs. Another grant enabled the planting of beach grass, shrubs, and other salt-tolerant plants along the boardwalk from Beach 24th-Beach 27th Streets in 1992. As a result of the plantings, a double-dune system developed that acts as a barrier against erosion and storm damage. The association's work resulted in the rezoning of the neighborhood. The rezoning protects the low-scale housing stock, including the bungalows and one- and two-family homes. It also secures the bungalows' ocean views and public access to the beach. There has been a renewed interest in the area in recent years, as many creative types from Manhattan have flocked to the Rockaways. Some of the bungalows have been restored, while property values have risen considerably. In the late 1990s, the BBPA began to work with other local preservationists to obtain governmental recognition of the district's status as the last intact bungalow community in Far Rockaway. Its efforts were boosted in 2011 when it received a $10,000 donation from the producers of the television show Boardwalk Empire, which had filmed scenes in the area in 2009. This enabled the organization to hire an expert to produce the documentation needed to support the 2013 listing on the National Register of Historic Places and similar state recognition. This status is largely symbolic, however, so the BBPA then shifted its focus to obtaining landmark district designation from the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, which would provide real legal protection to the district.New York State Office of Parks, Recreation & Historic Preservation.

The bridge formerly carried two lanes of US 29/US 70/NC 150, but is now part of the Davidson County Greenway system and Yadkin River Park. The bridge's location is on a popular trading path that has been used for centuries. The mail route from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans crossed the Yadkin at Trading Ford. Louis Beard built the first bridge, a toll bridge, in 1818. A later toll bridge went up in 1899 using the same piers. History as a highway bridge The bridge was completed in 1924 at a cost of $212,000, is , and consists of seven open spandrel arch spans. The Wil-Cox Bridge, named for highway commissioners W.E. Wilkinson of Charlotte and Elwood Cox of High Point, is one of only six of its type built in the state, and at the longest. A steel girder bridge built in 1951 as a companion to the Wil-Cox Bridge carried the northbound US 29 lanes and eastbound US 70 lanes but was closed in 2012. A pair of bridges on neighboring Interstate 85 (I-85) went up in 1957 and were replaced by a new pair of bridges in 2012. As of 2001, the city of Salisbury wanted to see the Wil-Cox Bridge preserved.Mark Wineka, \\"Road projects piling up for Salisbury area,\\" Salisbury Post, 2001-09-28. When the 1951 US 29/US 70 bridge is replaced, this bridge will no longer be used for traffic. Until early 2009, the state was planning to demolish the bridge, but preservationists wanted it saved as a pedestrian bridge, \\"a regional historical artifact\\" to become part of a planned greenway system. Davidson County decided to consider taking ownership and responsibility for maintenance, with the state giving the county the $2.5 million estimated cost of demolition. In March 2010, Davidson County voted to take the bridge, though one opponent pointed out that preserving the bridge would be more of a tourism advantage to Rowan County, which did not want the bridge. On April 8, 2010, the NCDOT closed the Wil-Cox Bridge due to safety concerns. Inspectors discovered the problems in December 2008, but the closure of the bridge was expected to take place in a few years once the replacement I-85 bridges were ready. Delays on the I-85 bridges meant these problems became serious enough to require repairs to keep the bridge in service. On July 21, 2010, Pat Ivey of the NCDOT said the bridge would be used as a detour during construction. The NC DOT spent $3 million on repairs. The work was underway as of February 2011. By April 15, 2011, upgrading on the bridge was halfway to completion. A month later, workers were using a technique called \\"shotcrete\\", using a hose to spray concrete into those spaces where damaged concrete had been removed. On September 1, 2011, work on Wil-Cox Bridge was complete, allowing the bridge to be used as a detour during replacement of the U.S. 29-70 bridge. The US 29/US 70 bridge built in 1951 closed April 17, 2012, with the new bridge scheduled to open by fall 2013. A portion of the temporary work bridge from the I-85 project was used to build the new bridge. Only cars going south could use the Wil-Cox Bridge until August 2012, when changes were made to allow traffic to go both ways. One-way traffic had a negative effect on businesses in Spencer. As of September 2013, the new bridge was expected to be complete by year end, at which time more repairs were to be made to the old bridge. Traffic moved to the new bridge on February 7, 2014. Tourist attraction Davidson County commissioners voted unanimously August 25, 2015 to take over the bridge. The state gave Davidson County the $2.5 million that would have been used for demolition, to be used for \\"preservation activities\\". Commissioners appointed a steering committee in September to work on attracting tourists. Tourist attractions in the area included Trading Ford and the former site of the Civil War fort Camp Yadkin, also called Fort York, where General George Stoneman crossed the Yadkin River and the location of one of the final military actions of the Civil War. Dr. Max Walser, chair of the Wil-Cox Bridge/Fort York Steering Committee, said in 2018 that Native Americans first lived in the area 12,000 years ago, and that Spanish settlers under Juan Pardo attempted to start a colony around 1567. Explorer John Lederer visited Saura Indians at Trading Ford in 1670. John Lawson described a Sapona settlement where Native Americans crossed the river. Rowan County was formed in 1753, and Salisbury in 1755, because this was the location of a popular trading path. During the American Revolution, Nathanael Greene crossed the river ahead of Charles Cornwallis, who could not follow because of flooding from a storm. Historians considered this event to be important to the Americans in the war. As of September 2013, the Tourism Recreation Investment Partnership for Davidson County Foundation was working on plans for the Wil-Cox Bridge, which was already part of the Daniel Boone Heritage Canoe Trail opened earlier in 2013. Davidson County commissioners agreed on August 23, 2016 to buy 13.82 acres at Fort York, which along with the bridge could attract tourists. The $137,500 purchase from LandTrust of Central North Carolina became official with the deed transfer ceremony November 10, 2016. The Wil-Cox Bridge/Fort York Steering Committee had its first meeting October 14, 2015. A groundbreaking took place July 30, 2018. Yadkin River Park held a ribbon cutting June 21, 2019. Plans call for a connection to the Carolina Thread Trail, and eventually trails will be built to Boone's Cave Park and other locations. Other bridges The North Carolina Railroad Yadkin River Bridges were built in 1906 and 1919 and each contain four spans of Warren deck truss.

Gasterosteus aculeatus, a documented case of ecological speciation Centaurea solstitialis, a candidate species for ecological speciation Ecological speciation is the process by which ecologically based divergent selection between different environments leads to the creation of reproductive barriers between populations. This is often the result of selection over traits which are genetically correlated to reproductive isolation, thus speciation occurs as a by-product of adaptive divergence. Ecological selection is \\"the interaction of individuals with their environment during resource acquisition\\". Natural selection is inherently involved in the process of speciation, whereby, \\"under ecological speciation, populations in different environments, or populations exploiting different resources, experience contrasting natural selection pressures on the traits that directly or indirectly bring about the evolution of reproductive isolation\\". Evidence for the role ecology plays in the process of speciation exists. Studies of stickleback populations support ecologically linked speciation arising as a by-product, alongside numerous studies of parallel speciation—of which, substantiates speciation's occurrence in nature. The key difference between ecological speciation and other kinds of speciation, is that it is triggered by divergent natural selection among different habitats; as opposed to other kinds of speciation processes, like random genetic drift, the fixation of incompatible mutations in populations experiencing similar selective pressures, or various forms of sexual selection not involving selection on ecologically relevant traits. Ecological speciation can occur either in allopatry, sympatry, or parapatry. The only requirement being that speciation occurs as a result of adaptation to different ecological or micro-ecological conditions. Some debate exists over the framework concerning the delineation of whether a speciation event is ecological or nonecological. \\"The pervasive effect of selection suggests that adaptive evolution and speciation are inseparable, casting doubt on whether speciation is ever nonecological\\". However, there are numerous examples of closely related, ecologically similar species (e.g., Albinaria land snails on islands in the Mediterranean, Batrachoseps salamanders from California, and certain crickets and damselflies), which is a pattern consistent with the possibility of nonecological speciation.  Parallel speciation  Parallel speciation is where \\"greater reproductive isolation repeatedly evolves between independent populations adapting to contrasting environments than between independent populations adapting to similar environments\\". It is established that ecological speciation occurs and with much of the evidence, \\"...accumulated from top-down studies of adaptation and reproductive isolation\\".  Research and supporting evidence  Known examples of ecological speciation are three- spined stickleback fishes, distinct species of which emerged as the result of adaptation to different conditions along water depth clines in freshwater lakes. Ancestors of the genus Ilex (holly) became isolated from the remaining Ilex when the landmass broke up into Gondwana and Laurasia about 82 million years ago, resulting in a physical separation of the groups (allopatry) and beginning its adaptation to new conditions; over time survivor species of the holly genus adapted to different ecological niches. The invasive weed species Centaurea solstitialis is thought to be a case of ecological speciation—in less than 200 years, incipient reproductive isolation appeared as a result of adaptation to differences in ecological conditions between native and non- native ranges. = Mosquito fish = Parallel speciation occurs, for example, in mosquito fish in the Bahamas, where Gambusia fish inhabit \\"blue holes\\"—carbonate caves and depressions flooded with water—throughout the islands. Some of the holes contain the piscivorous predator fish Gobiomorus dormitor, while others have no major predators except birds. The authors of the study tested for ecological speciation by measuring three different data sets: morphological data (to test for divergent natural selection), molecular data (to test for \\"replicated trait evolution in independent populations\\" with similar phenotypes), and mate-choice trials (to test for reproductive isolation between \\"ecologically divergent pairs of populations than ecologically similar ones\\": a by-product resulting from divergent traits). The study allowed for a natural experiment to test the effects of predator- mediated natural selection and its by-product: ecological speciation. The results suggested a \\"strong confirmation of the ecological speciation hypothesis\\" and amply supported parallel speciation taking place within the different blue holes. = Skinks = Another example is in skinks, where the genus Plestiodon (formerly Eumeces) has a complex evolutionary history with ecological speciation and parallel speciation of the three species (within two morphotypes): P. skiltonianus and P. lagunensis, and P. gilberti. P. gilberti occupies dry, low-elevation habitats, and has a larger body size and uniform, solid color scales. The other two species inhabit higher-elevation regions, have smaller bodies, and exhibit colored stripes. The members of the group have similar phenotypic stages during early development but differ in their morphology in later stages. A phylogenetic analysis using mtDNA of the entire group (including all species and subspecies of the Eumeces group inhabiting the western United States) combined with comparative approaches to morphology, and geographic distribution showed \\"instances of parallel morphological evolution...and provide evidence that this system is consistent with a model of ecological speciation\\" due to \\"the similarity in early ontogenetic trajectories and the close association between differences in body size and color pattern[s]\\" of each morphotype.

It is the type species of the genus Ophiopsila Original description “I have thought it necessary to constitute a genus for the reception of a naked-bodied, long-armed Ophiura, which is not uncommon in the seas of the Archipelago. It combines some of the characters of Ophiomyxa with some of those of the following genus, and has a habit peculiar to itself. But one species occurs. It has a round disc, sometimes lobed between the rays, flat, coriaceous and smooth. There are two linear nearly parallel separate shields opposite the origin of each ray. The upper ray-scales are square and minutely granulated ; the lower ones are quadrangular, with lunate sides. Each lateral ray-plate bears six spathulate spines, the lowest but one of which is longer than the rest, and the lowest smaller. In dead specimens the last laps over the ray-plate, so that its apex meets that of its fellow on the opposite side. The spines can lap close to the rays, except the undermost ones. The longest spines do not quite equal in length the breadth of the ray. The rays are 6½ times as long as the breadth of the disc. The ovarian plates are small and sub-pentagonal. When alive, the colours are brilliant shades of brown, morone [maroon], or orange: when dead, the creature is of a purplish brown. It inhabits various depths above 40 fathoms.” Forbes, 1843.

Millwall were formidable at the Athletics Grounds, winning 73% of their games. In total they played 147 games here in all competitions, winning 108, losing 24 and drawing 15. History On 10 May 1890 Millwall Rovers played their last game at their second ground, the Lord Nelson Ground, a piece of land situation behind the Lord Nelson pub, against Royal Arsenal to help raise funds for a new ground. The game raised £113 9s. The money helped Millwall moved into the Athletic Grounds. This was their first purpose-built ground, with a grandstand that seated 600 people and an overall capacity of between 10,000 and 15,000. The club dropped Rovers from their name, adopting Athletic to go with their new ground. The new ground was situated on East Ferry Road, opposite the Millwall Docks station. The club optained a 14-year lease from the Millwall Dock Company and it covered some 27 acres. The club was forced to move on 11 years into the lease, as the dock company wanted to use it as a timber yard. The last game at the Athletic Grounds was a 4–0 win over Bristol City on 27 April 1901 in the Western League. They relocated for the start of the 1901–1902 season to a location near their second home, which became known as North Greenwich. They remained an east London club for a further nine years, with the last game played on the Isle of Dogs on 8 October 1910 against Portsmouth, which Millwall won 3–1. Due to lack of expansion space in the Millwall area of East London, Millwall moved to South London in 1910 and into their ground, The Den. Attendances The record attendance at The Athletic Grounds of 20,000 was achieved twice in the FA Cup, in a 4–2 win against Woolwich Arsenal on 16 January 1897 in the Fifth qualifying round and a 1–1 draw with Aston Villa on 3 February 1900 in the Third round.

It is native to the Pacific coast of Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Panama. Reef ecology The coral reefs off the coast of Central America are thin and small relative to their counterparts in the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean. They are subject to periodic stresses such as El Niño events. In 1983–3, 50 to 90% of the corals in the region were lost. A large increase in the population of Diadema mexicanum resulted and there was an increase in damage to the reefs caused by their spines. Diadema mexicanum is a herbivore and an important member of the reef community and plays a significant role in controlling algal growth. By limiting this growth they are capable of preserving coral by reducing competition for space and light. However, when the populations of sea urchins get too large their spines cause excessive abrasion to the corals and bioerosion of the reef. Nevertheless, the reduction in algae present is beneficial for the settlement of coral larvae. A reduction in the number of sea urchins causes overgrowth of algae to the detriment of the corals, and little recruitment of corals occur. For the reef to recover after a bleaching event there needs to be a change in the balance between the rate of reef accumulation and reef erosion. It is necessary to maintain a healthy level of grazing by sea urchins to maintain a moderate algal cover and allow coral recruitment.

Design and development Before World War II, most glider pilots made their first flights solo on low cost single seat aircraft like the Zögling, even though those starting to fly powered aircraft flew with an instructor in a dual control machine. Luigi Teichfuss saw the advantages of ab initio dual control training early in the 1930s and began the design of his LT.12 in 1932. It was intended to be simple and robust. The LT.12 was a braced high-wing monoplane, with a wing that was rectangular in plan out to very near the blunt tips where the chord reduced slightly. The wing was held high over the fuselage on two plywood covered pillars like a cut-away pedestal, forward and aft of the rear, underwing, open cockpit. The forward cockpit was ahead of the leading edge. Two parallel faired struts braced the wing on each side from about mid-span to the lower fuselage longerons. The fuselage was a deep sided, almost rectangular hexagonal, plywood skinned wooden structure which tapered to the tail. The LT.12's tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage, with a straight, swept leading edge and carrying balanced elevators, the balances reducing the leading edge sweep outboard. The small fin was triangular, carrying a broad balanced rudder which moved in an elevator cut-out. The LT.12 had both a standard landing skid from nose to below the wing trailing edge combined with a rudder protecting tail bumper and a narrow track wheeled undercarriage, attached to the skid on half axles and with trailing struts. At least one LT.12 was used for pilot training by the Pavulla club and some of the three built were sold to other aero clubs.

Curl notes three more-specific usages: the platform-landing reached by symmetrical flights of steps leading to the piano nobile of a building; the steps themselves; or the platform base of edifices like a market cross.Curl, James Stevens (2006). Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture, 2nd ed., OUP, Oxford and New York, p. 573. . Perron also refers to a type of Belgian civic monument, which usually sits on a perron. A perron may be placed in front of the main entrance of a building or house, either as a single stone staircase or pair of such staircases leading up to the entrance and built in the Romanesque or Palladian styles and decorated with arches, balustrades and corbels. One of the largest and most impressive Baroque perrons is found outside Girona Cathedral and consists of 90 steps on three flights of stairs. The Calà del Sasso in Upper Italy has 4,444 steps and is one of the largest outside staircases in Europe. Also well known are the Spanish Steps in Rome, that lead from the Piazza di Spagna to the church of Santa Trinità dei Monti. At the theatre of Freilichtspiele Schwäbisch Hall, the perron in front of the town church is the main stage for theatre productions. The Strudlhofstiege in Vienna, an Art Nouveau style perron, is well known because it forms the title of a novel by Heimito von Doderer. The Weinbergtreppe or Weinbergstaffel is the name given to the outside steps used in vineyards. They are very steep and are often placed between high vineyard walls. They are normally made of natural stone ashlars.
